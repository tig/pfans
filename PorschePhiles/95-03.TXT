Subject: Turbo S Question

How does one know if they have a Turbo Cup car? I have an '89 951 Turbo S and
am curious if it is a Turbo Cup car. I saw someplace that they had such an
animal in '89.

Thanks in advance...

Subject: 944S idle problem (stalling out)

While we're on the subject with Jim Ringnalda's 944, I thought I'd chime in
on the 'ol S's status.  I have diconnected the O2 sensor at the prescribed
place (next to the rear of the valve cover in the white clip).  Well, first
of all, it was much easier then going for the connection at the exhaust, how
silly of me.  It didn't make any perceptable difference there either,
however.  The disconnection was performed at start-up plus 1minute, 10
minutes and roughly 17 minutes.  The car was reved up and down durring both
connected and disconnected phases of this test.  Again, no difference in
operation.  The sensor was exactly how Kevin and George described.  It
seperates to three connectors on each wire, one male and two female and
visa-versa.

I need someone to tell me if this means my O2 sensor is bad, or to elaborate
on what these test results show.  The engine performed seemingly fine with
the sensor disconnected.

Before I get more serious about hunting down this potentially temperature
related problem by fully removing the intake and poking around, I want to get
clarification on this O2 test and try some injector cleanor to see if I get
lucky.  I haven't ruled out the idle stabilizer either.

Thanks,

Subject: Oil and irreverance

Back in the early '60's, I determined that the manufacturer's
normally 'best' oils were significantly inferior to 'premium'
oils in air cooled engines.  This may not apply today, but ...
In a VW, I found that with 'best' oil, the valves started to
stick at about 1500 miles after an oil change.  Putting in the
'super-premium' oils of the day would unstick the valves and
free the engine until I finally would get around to changing
the oil.

This cycle got repeated multiple times because I had cases of
Valvoline oil to use up.

Today, with no reverence, I change my oil in my daily use cars
twice a year .. more or less.  Modern synthetics hold up their
lubrication and viscosity properties pretty well.  They would be
rated 12,000 miles except for the legal liabilities related to
car manufacturer's recommendation of a typical 7500 mile change.

In racing engines, I used Castrol R.  It smells nice.  It also
lubricates well.  It doesn't mix with other oils.  Don't even
think of trying !!!!  .. then I haven't raced for a long time.

The lore in aircraft engines was always that the probability
of failure was highest just after an oil change.  I don't
know if it is true.

Just because your oil looks black doesn't mean that it has
stopped lubricating.

	I am in a much better mood now my new(ish) puppy is idling like a pro; 
my express thanks go to George who tripped my memory at the right time 
regarding a loose vacuum hose.  My hand still hurts from getting the line from 
the idle control valve back onto the intake manifold (most easily done from

Subject: 944 engines, No. 2's

George Beuselinck and pfilers,
       greetings from Down Under and a question for George and any other
interested people.
Of all the motors you have torn down, what percentage roughly have had
problems on the No. 2 bearings ?  Most common failures we have over here
seeems to be no. 2 rod bearing doesn't get enough oil.  Worst failures are
No. 2 rod bolts fail after the bearing; and then usually destroy the case.
One we recently stripped down, due to noise after a track day, had a bent
crank, bad no. 2 bearing, bad water pump bearings and bad oil pump bearing.
Lo and Behold, the crank showed signs of corrosion, again at No. 2.
Peter Fitzgerald, who is a prominent racer over here, his 944 Turbo is
actually a Turbo 3litre, has come up with a fix which can be applied. The
motor has to be out to do it and I dare say we will find it out next week
when we rebuild this motor. He also recommends only Castrol R synthetic or
at worst Mobil 1 Synthetic as the best oils for track and club cars,
regards,
Joe Martens  '86 944.

I can't give an explanation to that rattling noise but I have exactly the
same noise with my 85/2 944. If for instance, I'm waiting at a red light, in
order to get this annoying sounds off I have to depress the clucth. I bought

I think the ad is about right. The 961, if I remember correctly, was the 
racing version of the 959- track racing, that is. I remember the 961 
competed at Le Mans sometime in the mid '80s, and at least one of them 
was destroyed in a crash. There was also a rally version of the 959, 
including an off-road type with big knobby tires, which, I believe, won 
the Paris-Dakar race one year.

But US$2.5M?!? That's a lot of money for a car that presumably cannot be 
used- investment purposes only?!? Would the 961 fit in any current 
racing category? I guess you could autocross it. :-)

My '84 944 has always done this, and the dealer assured me that it was
normal.  Of course, my temp gauge rarely gets above the 1/3 mark, even
in summer with the A/C on.

Is your temp. gauge showing what you consider to be normal readings?  If
so, just keeping a little throttle on at the light on the real cold 
mornings, like I do, may be the best option.  Otherwise, things may
start to get expensive to solve a minor annoyance that may actually

A long time ago, when I was in high school back in Texas, a buddy of mine told

 He was convinced that the cop was harrassing him for being a teenager; I was

Subject: Re: Failure to signal



Let me share with you the events I was unfortunate to experience
last week.

My SO and I were driving home from a friends place at about 1 in the
morning after the four of us had been out for a meal at pretty good 
Chinese restaurant a few miles away.

We were about a mile away from our house when I noticed a car coming
up rather quickly behind me. The road conditions were pretty poor (ice) 
so I assumed it must be one of the local idiots (Basingstoke is full
of them), and slowed down a little to let them past.
The car behind also slowed and began to follow me. After approx
200 yards the thing lit up like a Christmas tree and pulled me over.

Both I and the Woman PC got out of our vehicles and the conversation
went like this :-

Me:  Hello Officer what seems to be the problem ?
WPC: Tanking it a bit up there weren't we ?
Me:  No (I had been spot on the limit).
WPC: Do you know what the speed limit is on this road ?
Me:  Yes, 40 MPH
WPC: You appear to have a faulty rear light
Me:  Oh, where ? (checking the rear lights)
WPC: That one there is not as bright as the other side. (pointing to lhs)
     Have you been drinking, Sir ?
Me:  I had one glass of wine with a meal about three hours ago.
WPC: In that case Sir, in view of that fact that you have committed
     a moving traffic violation and have admitted to me that you have
     comsumed alcohol I must ask you to provide me with a specimen 
     of breath.

(Long explanation of breathalyzer procedure and half hour stood at
 the roadside ommitted....)

WPC: Well Sir, that looks OK but I must give you a caution about driving
     with defective lights (giving me a caution notice).
     You must take your car to a Ministry of Transport Testing Station
     within 14 days and have the examiner certify that the light has 
     been repaired. You must then return this notice to the address
     on the back.
     You must also produce your documents (Insurance cert etc.) at 
     the local station within 7 days.
Me:  Uh, OK.

2 days after this incident I took my documents into the local Police 
Station to prove that yes, I did have a driving licence, yes, I was
insured and yes, my car did have a current MOT certificate.

The officer on duty was quite friendly and just complained about all 
the paperwork ( he had to fill in three forms for this 'offence').

When I showed him my caution notice he was amazed, his comment was :-
"What ? For THIS ? She must have been bored that night !"
"Don't fix the light yourself, because the testing station will usually
 charge you a fiver just to stamp the notice"
(Too late I'd already done it - I carry spares).

What really pi**es me off is that this b*tch of a WPC has cost me 
at least two lunch breaks and about $5 just because one rear light
was not as bright as the other. I was not given an opportunity 
to change the bulb there and then, nor did I get the usual :-
"Please get it fixed Sir, if it's still broken in a few 
 days time I'll have to book you"
I suspect that she was hoping for a 'Driving under the Influence'
charge and was upset because she didn't get it. A little 
Porsche-Paranoia may also have been involved.

I don't know why you think the original note came from Timothy, but Larry

   I didn't, but yes I drive it, I pay for it, I love it, but boy, I can't

Subject: No more shake, rattle and roll on my 944!

Hi gang!
	Here's a follow up on a problem I had with my car (85.1 944):

I was getting a rattling noise from the engine, driver's side any time I
decelerated and the rpms dropped from about 3K to 2K. It sounded like marbles!
It drove me nuts...

I searched around and found that the noise was comming from below the intake
manifold. By placing my hand on top of the upper balance shaft cover, I could
feel the rattling. 

Some people suggested that it might be trans noise. Well, I'm happy to report
that after changing the rear bearing on the bal shaft the noise has gone away!

My theory is that perhaphs the belt could have been overtightened at some
point, applying too much force to the whole shaft and making the bearing fail.
It could also be caused by normal wear (@ 95K miles).

But who knows and who cares! I already ordered the lower shaft bearings.
Do you guys know that it takes 1 week for my local P dealer to get parts from
Reno. I could have it FedEx and have it sooner for about another $16!

Anyway, does any one know (Jim P, George or Kevin) if the bal shafts are tuned
to work at different engine RPMs? I know that 4 cyl engines have second
order vibes that the balance shafts are supposed to counteract. I got rid of 
the 2K vibration. Now I'm chasing one at 4K. (lower shaft?) 
Are 2 and 4K (+/- a few hundred rpm) the 944s resonnant frequencies?

Subject: Monthly Update for March, 1995

March 1995

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

It's been a *LONG* couple of months... I didn't get out an Update in
February, so it's been a while. There have been all sorts of developments.

The old and creaky hardware I'm using has started getting enough load that
it from time to time re-processes messages, showing up as multiple copies
of mail on the list. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS. That's why there's a "delete"
key in your mail progam!! And please don't feel the need to tell me about 
it -- I get the first piece of mail delivered by the list software, and the
first digest delivered by the digest software, so I already know. Your note
just adds to the load that's causing the problem... the thought *IS* greatly
appreciated, though!

While on that subject, Bart Chambers  (bartonc@infi.net, bart@tta.com) is
leading the charge to set up the Porschephiles Foundation. It's a non-profit
organization with a single goal: make sure that the finances are available
to keep this list on the air, and free to all. Sort of like Public Television,
but we won't send out notices between the notes for a week once a year... 8{)
If you're interested, send him a note.

There is some progress on affiliating Porschephiles with PCA, which would give
us access to lots of material that we just can't use at this point. Care is
being taken to insure that this affiliation does not damage the character
of the list. Things being what they are, this is moving slowly, and I WILL
keep you informed.

The Who's Who is out of date. There are 68 pending requests to be added or
changed, and there is a good chance that some folks on it now have dropped.
I'll get that fixed soon, in the mean time, what I have follows this note
in a separate message.

Got to run, more later!!

ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies 
to major downloading of stuff from the archives, not WWW access. Suggestions 
for improving the WWW pages would be welcomed, as well as experienced help
in doing so.

CLUB-INFO

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 if you have to.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Well does it have a factory installed rollcage, racing recaro seat, fiberglass
hood, no power steering, small lightweight mirrors, radio delete, roll-up
windows, magnesium wheels?

many other differences in drivetrain components & suspension also.

I'm not sure if there were any 89 Cup cars.

Jeff, I replaced the 195/50/15's I was using with the AVS intermediate
in 205/60/15 when I stopped using the car for Auto-x.  I like the looks
better, they fit fine, and it brings the gearing back a little closer to 
the stock ratio (which is nice on the highway).

Hi Bart,

So you're the guy who bought the famous - almost Porschephiles
list sponsored 914 race car!!  It's nice to hear from someone who
also appreciates the finer points of the 914 breed.  I am even
crazy enough to have sold my 911 to get a big six in a 914 - some
would say to have my head examined,  but I like it!

In answer to your questions, my engine was a 3.0 SC.  It has 98mm
piston/cyl kit, the cylinders were cut, pistons pocketed & champhered.  The
SC heads were used and ports enlarged, then
decked to end up with about 11.5:1 compression.  Horsepower
is somewhere around 325.  Some other neat stuff was done, but I won't bore
you with the details.    

I am using carbs, and I don't personally know anyone still using the
DME on the 3.2 in this application.  If I can be of assistance in your
venture let me know.  good luck

- ---------------------------------------------------
The technical Bulletin (#9011) I have is dated November 13, 1990. It describes
the new mount # 951.375.042.04. This "new" mount came out over 4 years ago!
The new mount does not use fluid for the dampening of engine vibration. This
is the first I have heard about a spring ? The mounts that are on sale now
are the "04" version, that is at least at all the places I called. They can
be found for around $120.00 each (discounted). They are readily available at
this price.

Subject: Lambda (O2) Sensor Testing

Since there seems to be an interest, this is the testing procedure found in 
"How to Tune and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection" by Ben Watson, Motorbooks 
Int., ISBN 0-87938-570-7.  (Hopefully that will keep me out of trouble with 
copyright laws . . .)

1.   Disconnect the connector between the sensor and the computer.
2.   Connect a high-impedance voltmeter between the sensor and ground.
3.   Start the engine and warm up completely (the engine, not you.)
4.   Hold the Lambda lead to the ECU with one hand and touch the positive 
battery terminal with the other hand.  Engine RPM and sensor voltage should 
drop.
5.   If step 4 fails, connect the Lambda lead to ground.  RPM and sensor 
voltage should rise.

If the system passes *either* test, the system is working properly.  If the 
RPM changes but the Lambda voltage does not, replace the Lambda sensor.  If 
neither change, check for continuity on the wire to the ECU.  If the wire 
and connection are good, replace the ECU.

Good luck (and don't shoot the messenger),

Subject: 944 O2 sensor anomalies


Performed some O2 sensor checks.  Cannot explain some things.

Running open loop, fully hot engine.  Measured volts at O2 sensor while 
applying 1.5V dry cell to DME O2 input.  0.00V (full lean).  This I 
understand since I told the DME the mix is full rich - so it drove mix full 
lean.

Next grounded DME O2 input.  Wanted to see 1.00V at O2 sensor.  Only got 
about 0.85V.  Do not understand.

Next, still open loop, diddled with mix screw in air flow meter.  Discovered 
it was nearly all the way closed (rich rich rich supposedly) but O2 sensor 
sat around 0.75V - only a little rich (0.45V = stoich optimal).

OK, so I began backing out the mix screw to lean out - watching, hoping to 
back things down around 0.45V.  No could do.  After 70 (yes, seventy) 
counter-clockwise turns could only lean it down to about 0.55V.  Am assuming 
that only first N turns actually did anything.  But I know O2 sensor is 
capable of reading 0.00V since it did so during DME test above.  Do not 
understand why unable to lean out enough via mix screw.

Engine runs extremely well now with O2 sensor reconnected.  Stumble under 
accel problem gone.  Have no clue where closed loop mix is really sitting 
now.

Suspecting marginal O2 sensor - drift with age.  Mine is original.  137K 
miles.



========================================================
Questions.......

O2 source suggestions?  Expected $$$?

Tricks to break them loose from exhaust pipe.  I expect great difficulty.

Danger of leaving things as they are?  Runs better than it has in years. 
 Melt cat?  Foul plugs?  Blow up engine?

Why don't shops [w/ gas analysis machines] set mix closed loop - account for 
marginal O2 sensors?  As I understand, they set mix open loop [at idle].

Thank you all for any info here.

Dragich doesn't sell *any* Porsche (or other import) related material

1) >Is it possible to make the engine run good on original carb?
Yes. The factory did it. Big bore kit (1720 cc, not 1620?) may mean you have to
try some different jets for high speed but probably not for idle.
 
2) First try cleaning and adjusting your carburetors. Thoroughly
disassemble, clean, reassemble, and set idle mixture using 2 idle mixture
screws on each carburetor. This is a sensitive adjustment. Also are your
throttle linkages set up correctly and idle speed of both carbs matched? 90
percent probability that your problem lies in cleaning/adjusting.
 
3) >I know that I can change to larger air jets from 210 to ???
Won't change any idle problems. Air correction jets only do things at high
rpm. My factory shop manual indicates that the Normal used 230 air
correction jets, the Super used 220. You could try taking a jet out and
taking it to a VW parts place, I don't know if the Zenith jets are shared
with VW applications but some Solex jets (main, air correction) are also
shared by VW. If for some reason you are getting more air (big bore kit,
wilder cam) you will need to fool with the air correction jet (smaller) and
main jet (bigger).
 
4) >I have now changed the piston rings and same problem occurs.
When changing rings, did you break the glaze on the cylinder walls? If not,
they may not seat properly. Even if the cylinder looks fine, you have to
give it a slightly rough surface with a cylinder hone to make new rings
seat.
 
5) >And if I decide to buy Webers
If you are having trouble setting up simple Zeniths to run properly on your
engine, you will have 10x as much trouble setting up aftermarket Webers
which weren't designed for your engine in any case. If you want to use
2-barrel carburetors, find some Solexes from 356 S90, 356SC or 912.
 
6) 356s always run rich at idle, dark plugs at idle are normal. Are they
dark after extended high-speed driving? To check, cut the ignition while
still running at higher speed under load (as after extended cruising on
highway, perhaps 100 km/h or above), pull plug, check color.
 
7) Which Zenith do you have? The Normals used 24 mm venturis, the Super used
28 mm. You should have 28 mm on your 1965 C.
 
8) If your big bore kit was combined with a camshaft for more power, you are
probably undercarbureted and will need bigger venturis. The Webers normally
come with 28 mm venturis, not much better than your Zeniths. The Solexes have
32 mm. Webers with larger venturis are possible but hard to find and there
is a problem compared to Solex; see (10).
 
9) I have never seen a Weber retrofit installation that worked worth a damn.
The people who perpetrate these things claim "more power" but what they are
really selling is more bottom end torque with the smaller (smaller than
Solex) venturis, at the expense of top end power and torque. A good Solex
will pull strongly well past 6000 rpm. A 28 mm Weber will fall down well
before that. The customer feels more pull at 2000 or 3000 rpm but doesn't
realize that there is less at 5000 and 6000. These things are very
subjective and the human senses are easily fooled. Without dynamometer or
road test numbers, you really don't know what you're getting. I once played
with velocity stacks on my 356 SC, felt "wow, it's really moving now" and
when I looked at the acceleration numbers and instantaneous acceleration,
the car was actually worse than with ordinary Solex air cleaners. The stacks
will work better than the cleaners, but not without more rejetting and
accurate testing.
 
10) There is something called throttle ratio or throat to throttle ratio of
carburetors. Basically, it says there is an optimum venturi size for a given
inlet size. You can't just keep sticking bigger venturis into a carburetor
and expect it to maintain its drivability. That's the problem with putting
even bigger venturis in the Weber; its drivability goes to hell. Maybe OK
for racing, not OK for street.

One technique that I have used very successfully in the Bay Area when being 
followed too closely is to simply use the flat of my hand to signal "Please 
back off" while mouthing the words.  I then follow up with the universal okay

This technique actually surprised me with its effectiveness the first few

No kidding, I see this routinely here in Santa Barbara County where traffic
can generally be considered light to moderate.  Seems that my poor little
911 attracts it's share of tailgaiters.  At 70 mph, I've had people follow
me so closely that I can't even see any space between our two cars!  The
worst violators are drivers of "Sport Utillity Vehicles".  I guess they
figure that if the need to stop rapidly occurs, they'll just launch off the
back of my 911!

Interesting since I estimate that over 90% of law enforcemnt officers (CHP
included) fail to use their signals at *any* time.  This is particularly
troublesome considering that these people are supposed to be "professional"
drivers.  They set a poor example.

When I was a kid, driving seemed a joy in California.  Drivers were
generally polite and they generally signaled their intentions.  I remember
my dad complaining about lack of signaling and rude drivers on our summer
trips outside of California.  Now the is the norm throughout the country
rather than the exception.

But, what can you do?

I don' buy no parts from no Twinks. Sure, they're high priced, but they're
also incompetent, so that makes up for it <g>. You are paying for their
slick catalog. (Not too long ago, I think I got their catalog no. 19 on one
day, and the next day catalog no. 18 arrived. I love it...)
 
For the absolute best service (and high prices, but sometimes you have to
bite the bullet) call Stoddard. They have just about everything, and are
owned by Porsche (that explains the pricing). 1-800-342-1414. You need their
catalog anyway just to see what is available. I think it's $5, refundable on
first order.
 
I think Carlsen Porsche Audi has a deal where if you tell the parts lady
that you are on Porschephiles you get a discount. I think anything Stoddard has
is effectively an official Porsche part available through dealers so maybe you
can go that route. Ask for Linda at Carlsen Porsche Audi, 1-800-523-2408
 
Zims in Texas is sometimes expensive, sometimes has deals. 1-800-356-2964
 
Call Doc & Cy's, 1-800-950-0356, to get their catalog. Haven't dealt with
them but their prices seem OK.
 
There are lots of used parts dealers -- Aase Bros, EASY, Southern California
Import Dismantlers, to name just a few.

Cool..I just received my first digest from Porshephiles. Good info. I guess
I am one of you (or us now). I acquired a 83 euro 911SC targa a couple of

911 just is so much more fun to drive. I am sure this topic has been
discussed quite a bit, so please point me to a reference or reply:
 I have been reading a lot about the need for Carrera tensioner upgrade. I
would love to keep my car for a long time, and would like experts' opinion.
Is this upgrage that critical? Can I get similar protection by installing
chain guards (sold at Automotion and Performance Products) for about $25?
What is the reason that these guards cannot be used with Carrera tensioner?
I also notices the variation in prices: 350 to 500 on tensioners. Are they
all the same? Also is there a good and cheap manual that shows how to
upgrade the tensioner? What other tasks should I perform while installing
the tensioner? The car has 87k miles on it, and runs great! Does the short
stroke shifter work well? Can I buy Carreat type leather seats to fit my
911 (at reasonable price)? I am sorry I have so many questions, but I would
love to start working on the car even though the car does not need any so
far.

Good question, so, I'll copy pfiles on the answer...

The drawbacks are:

1) you can't write notes on the fiche.  My old manuals are filled with
corrections, notes, and missing steps.

2) It tends to be tough to have the fiche in the shop when you are trying to
remove a greasy/oily part...Fiche and viewers do not take kindly to grease
spots...

3) You have to plan a bit more with the fiche...What I tend to do is take
notes on what procedure I'm going to do, then do it from the notes...

4) The wiring diagrams are in negative (i.e. white lines on black background
vice black lines on white background.) Not as easy to read.

I got an intermittent switch at the front center of the roof.   Usually
I can close the roof but not open it, and if i take the roof off i can
get the clamps to retract but not come back out
to hold the roof on again.

The reason I say its the switch is that I've been able to shine a light on the switch,
and stick a screwdriver in the edge that looks like theres a metal switch contact,
short that and the roof clamps work again.

If I pry the switch voer cover off with a screwdriver, am I likely to break it.
Can I just replace the cover if I do?> WHat is the "correct" labor-intensive
way to replace it. Its not obvious to me what interior panels shpould come off.
It doesnt look easy like the rear roof panels were (I took those off, then

Paul,

I've had problems with the same switch on my 944.  Yes, you can pry the
plastic trapizoid off without doing dammage.  

I don't know the "correct" procedure - probably replace the switch,
but I heard that was a big job taking lots of interior apart.  So,
I went the easy route and just cleaned the switch with contact cleaner
and haven't had a problem since.

Good luck,

Hi Michael,

Yes, I've used this method too.  Sometimes it actually does work.  This
leads me to believe that these people are probably not paying too much
attention to their driving and are more than happy to comply once awakened.
Surprisingly, when the people do back off they acknowlege with a wave or
sheepish smile.

Of course, there are others who become more angry at this friendly
admonishment.  With these guys, I will usually sqeeze into the right lane,
let them pass and tailgate the next guy while I merge back in and follow
him at a safe distance until the traffic clears. . .

Subject: RE: Tire Mounting Advice Sought


Andrew,

To get the old tire off and the new one on, the mounting machine needs
to locate and lock down the rim.  The way the average shop machine
does it is by three or more "feet" which are pressed out and against the
inside of the rim.  Yes, they do leave the dimples you notice, which I am
sure must be a problem for some folks, esp. those who concours.

There is apparently at least one kind of machine which "does not
touch the rim," whatever that means.  I remember that a local tire place
(Direct Tire) used to advertise this feature.  I used them once about
six years ago, and they had idiots running the machine, mooting any
benefit it may have had.

The factory probably has machines dedicated to their particular rim
dimensions and bolt pattern, making it possible to locate the rim the
same way a car's hub does.  A shop has to deal with a ton of different
rim dimensions and lug layouts (count, diameter, and fillet shape).

Many libraries have fiche viewers that have a built in electrostatic

copier. So, you can print out the germain "pages". In fact, if you can't spring
for a fiche viewer just now, use the library's fiche viewer to locate 
the sections
you need and then print them out. Also, some of these fiche "copiers" have
the ability to print in posative or negative, so you could reverse the coloring
of the wiring diagrams, for example.

I don't have the service manual on fiche, but I do have the parts catalog
for my model and year on fiche. The parts list is almost as valuable an aid
as the service manual because it contains exploded views of all of the car,
along with all of the part numbers. So, if you get the service manual, don't
forget to get the parts list fiche also.

Are you saying that your signal *was* on but he pretended it wasn't, or that
it should have been obvious you were turning since you were in a turn lane?
If the latter, well, the law still requires a signal even if it is a 
dedicated turn
lane. I know it seems dumb, but the law tends to be overly broad and does
not allow for judgement calls. This is a double edged sword. While it
makes for some dumb interpretation of the law, it also supposedly
reduces the chance of harrasement since the law is being applied
equally with supposedly minimal interpretation at the level of the
enforcing officer. That is the theory anyway. As someone's sig notes,
systems involving humans are imperfect 'cause humans are imperfect.

And along the same lines, I noticed as I sat in a turn lane this
morning that only about a third of the drivers had their signals on.

And while I am rambling along, I want to relate an incident about
believing turn signals. FWIW, this is from a newspaper account
of an actual incident. Two cars were proceeding in the same
direction on a two lane highway. The front car slows approaching
an intersection and appears to be flashing the left turn signal.
The car in back pulls onto the shoulder to pass on the right.
The car in front turns right rather than left and is broadsided.
What happened? The car in front had a burned out right
rear brake lamp and the driver was pumping the brakes. I
guess the moral here is don't pass on the right and don't
assume the other guy knows what he/she is doing (i.e. drive
defensively). The Porsche you save may be your own!

I wonder if anyone has done any statistical analysis of
injuries/deaths per mile driven on race tracks versus
highways? I bet that racing is safer than driving on the
street! (at least with modern race cars anyway)

Yes.  The only possible difference is replacing the tensioner sprockets 
rather than using the spacers in the kit, but this does not apply to your 
'83.  It already has the newer sprockets.

Also is there a good and cheap manual that shows how to
>upgrade the tensioner? 

I could mail you a few xeroxed pages if nothing comes with your kit (when 
you buy it).

I did this on my '83 SC a couple of years ago.  First, the REAL danger isn't 
failed tensioners per se, it's the broken pieces of chain rail (broken by 
the slapping loose chain) that are caught between the chain and sprocket, 
breaking the chain.  This is less of a risk in our '83s than in earlier cars 
because of improved chain rails which are less prone to become brittle and 
break.

I bought my SC with about the mileage as yours, drove it about 30k mi. 
before doing the tensioners.  There was no indication of failure.  When I 
removed the old tensioners, one required a vise to compress, the other I 
could work like a joystick with my thumb.  I also replaced the chain rails 
(another $30 for the set).  The job took all day.

In Dallas TX, the freeways are like a NASCAR race with people following 1
car length, or less, at speeds up to 100 mph. This is when the freeways are
not being used as parking lots durring rush hours. The drivers that really
piss people off are slow movers in the left lane. The left lane is where
the NASCAR race is run most of the time. Driving is generally OK, except
for the drivers that like to snake through traffic by cutting between lanes
with no warning. These are the real danger to most drivers.

If you come to Dallas and signal people to stop tailgateing, they will signal
you to get the hell out of their way. People can get real hostile when they
get into their cars. The worst drivers use Honda Accords as their weapon
for the road. They tend to be the ones whipping lanes all the time.

Hello PPphilers:
Kevin Murrell's story about the "problem"  with his tailight
reminded me of something along the same line that happened to me.
Last summer, around mid Jul, I was driving my mother home when I
noticed flashing lights in my rear view mirror.  I pull over and
wait.  The police officer (whose name was Don Johnson believe it or
not) comes over and askes for my license and registration.
Finally, after asking him several times he tells me my crime is
that I was driving with only driving lights on, not head lights.
Now this is about 8:45 p.m. in JULY, it is not that dark out and I
dont even know why I had the lights on.  But he proceded to give
me a warning ticket anyway.  That is after he spent 30 minutes
going over my documents and checking them against their records at
the station via the dispatcher.  The worst part is that my mother
is giving me the third degree while he is doing all this.  Now had
I been driving a piece of junk GM product he would have probably
let me go and wouldnt  have bothered *SHEESH*

Subject: Looking for Interior Photos of 68 911L

Hi All,

I've been lurking on the P-files since Mid-Novemberish and have enjoyed reading
the material presented.

Last April, I picked up '68 911L that actually runs quite well and doesn't look
to terrible either.  It requires some structual work which is well beyond my
abilities (been socking away the $$$ for next winter).  It is not my intention
to make this a track car - just what it to look nice and 'right'.  This I CAN
handle quite nicely, and that's where my questions come in.

First off, any one know somebody that I could snail-mail some film (post paid
both ways) to get some good photos of the interior of the same make?

It's well documented that the '68 has a unique dash, but how (Shape,
instrument cluster, instrument labeling etc)?

And now for two head scractchers:

1) Where the hell is the Hazard light relay hiding (it's not behind all the 
duct work up under the center of the windshield is it)?  I have find just
about every relay but that one. Is it part of the turnsignal relay and I have
just lost part of the component? 

BTW - Anyone got a good photocopy of the wiring diagram for 67/68 car?
Haynes thoughtfully left the early cars out of the manual because the 
wiring diagram is provided in the owners manual. - Guess which single page 
is missing from my manual...

2) What style are internal door panels supposed to be?  I've got a different
panel on each side.  

   The passenger side is just a horizontal arm rest with the lock release 
   on a button at the forward end of the handle.

   The driver side looks similiar to part PK-9000 on page 53 of the 20th 
   aniversery issue of the Automotion catalog (except I don't have those
   diagonal ridges running down the upper half - it is smooth.)

Pardon all the questions for the first post if it is easier, E-mail me
directly to save wear and tear on the Mod's system... :^)

As far as your flasher relay, try under the drivers floorboard.
on your door panels, I believe the one you describe as your passenger side is

A couple of years ago I found out firsthand why Dallas drivers don't signal
lane changes.
I was towing a 46 foot race car trailer from Roebling Road to Denver and
since it was November, took the southern route.  (The trailer had 2 Porsche
vintage racers in it.  Subject requirement satisfied, I hope)
I discovered when I finally had a hole big enough to change lanes into,
(trailer and dually about 60 feet total length), if I signalled my intention
either the car at the rear would speed up to fill the hole, or someone in an
adjacent lane would dive into it.  The only possible way to do it was to find
the hole and take it VERY aggressively without signal one.  I don't know if
this was just "Big D's" way of greeting a Colorado driver or if they are just
as hard on their own.
Regarding commonalities among rude drivers, I once observed while driving
from Sante Fe, NM to Albuquerque on I-25 at a steady 80 mph, (this was in the
days of 55 mph even on interstates)  the only things passing me were native

Wow I finally got on!  I've got a 66 912 that I bought a few months ago and I 
have a few questions (actually I've got a lot more than a few, but for now I'll 
keep it to a minimum!)

1)  I've got Weber 40 IDF's and I am just about done rebuilding them.  I have 
read several different specs for float level adjustment and am not sure what to 
use.  

2)  I would like to get the seats redone.  The springs/foam are shot and I'd 
like to get new covers installed.  Anyone know a cheap way to do this (remember 
I am a 912 owner!)

3)  This is my second 912 that I have owned and I have  driven probably 10 in my 
life.  I have never seen one that first gear syncro works but all the specs say 
that first gear is synchronized.  Is it?

4)  What type of transmission fluid should I use.  The books say 90 wt but I 
can't find any such lube at the local auto parts store.

5)  The headlights suck.  Any recommendations for a good set (remember low $) 
that will work OK with puny generator? 

6)  I have yet to completely figure out how the double flapper heat boxes all 
hook up and work. I live in Oregon and it gets kinda cold and I want heat.  
Anyone know a book or have a explanation how the single lever opens/closes all 
the associated hardware?  My heater boxes are in great shape but I've got to 
install hoses and ?

7) I always get a pretty strong gas smell inside the car after about a half an 
hour.  I hope the rebuilt carbs will help (I also replace all fuel line).  If 
not is this related to something else? (like maybe #6?)

8)  What's the easiest way to tell if the generator is bad or the regulator.  My 
generator light comes on occasionally and I have installed a new belt, checked 
tension, etc.  My generator is looking a bit old (I can see duck tape on some 
wires inside) so it's probably time for a new one.  I read that there is a 
higher wattage generator used in later 912's.  Can I use that in my 66?  I 
would like to get some really high wattage headlights and if I need to get 
another generator anyway I would like to GET MORE POWER.

Well that's it for now.  Any info will be greatly appreciated!  

Thanx

It's only the ones who have automatics in their Legends (mine is a

Speaking of Legends...

After driving my 928 and Legend lately, it seems to me that the

Correct me if I'm wrong but . . .

The Lambda sensor measures the difference between O2 in the exhaust gas and 
O2 in the ambient air, therefore, there is no way that a functioning sensor 
could yield a *zero* voltage.  No voltage would mean no oxygen was consumed.

The "normal" operating range for a Lambda sensor (again, from "How to Tune 
and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection" by Ben Watson) is 0.1v - 0.9v.

Since the 944 that is having problems (forgive me, I didn't write down 
whose) has a Lambda sensor that is showing a constant rich running, the 
computer should try to lean the mixture.  If it succeeds and adjusts the mix 
excessively lean, the engine could be damaged.  (does the temp gauge run hot?)

OTOH, if the sensor is correct and the ECU/DME/computer is at fault (not 
responding to the sensor voltage) the rich running will cause excessive fuel 
consumption and could (long term) cause the cat to meltdown.

Determining which part -- the sensor, the DME orthe harness linking them -- 
is at fault is left as an exercise for the reader.

this is a "me, too" posting.  I work in the western 'burbs of Philadelphia,
and I 've noticed that the most aggressive, and frequently the least
competent, drivers drive small Japanese cars.  They always get my attention,
because they always seems to perform some stupid maneuver, like making a fast
right turn from the left lane, and I make a point of noting the car they
drive.

On the other hand, I've been stuck behind drivers who, upon seeing my 911,
slow down deliberately to "conform" to the posted limit, and they seem to be
invariably driving Volvo station wagons with "Save the Whales" stickers<g>.

This isn't a Porsche specific question, but...

What is the best solution to use when washing your car?  Is dish
washing detergent ok or is something like Turtle Wax Car Wash a 
better thing to use?  Or should you skip the soap and just use
a lot of water and soft cloth/sponge?

What is the best way to dry a newly washed car?  I usually take it
for a quick spin to get the majority of the water off and then
use a terry cloth towel.  I have a chamois - but it never seemed
to work well for me.  I was told to get it (the chammy) wet first.
Is a real chamois better or worse than the synthetic ones?

Hi Michael,

Yes, I've used this method too.  Sometimes it actually does work.  This
leads me to believe that these people are probably not paying too much
attention to their driving and are more than happy to comply once awakened.
Surprisingly, when the people do back off they acknowlege with a wave or
sheepish smile.

Of course, there are others who become more angry at this friendly
admonishment.  With these guys, I will usually sqeeze into the right lane,
let them pass and tailgate the next guy while I merge back in and follow
him at a safe distance until the traffic clears. . .

Funny, I frequently see just the opposite.  If I'm driving 60 people will
go 65 to pass my 911, if I drive 70, people will go 75 and so on.  Maybe
they're jealous or maybe the just want to get a look at a Porsche or maybe
they want to race.  Who knows.

Drivers of whale saving Volvos seem to move to the beat of a different
drummer regardless of surrounding traffic, but generally they're pretty
slow.

These days, I just try to stay out of everyone else's way.  So far, so good.

Sure.
Mustang GT owners tend to try to race everything in sight. And the 
younger Mustang GT drivers tend to not know how to drive correctly.

Women in sports cars often tend to be aggressive drivers, as well as 
women in SUVs. (let the flames come, I call it as I see it)

Asian drivers in general are often terrible. I don't know if I can count 
myself in this group, but around school, a lot of them are downright 
indecisive or psychopathically dangerous.

Subject: More 944 Motor Mounts

The latest update:

Porsche has long since superceded all 944 motor mounts to "04", which is the
only mount still in the price book ($197.00 as of the March 1, 1994 book).

There is an "07" mount, but that appears to be only for 968s with automatic
transmissions (!?).

As the supercession to "04" occured almost 5 years ago, there are probably
none left anywhere. The mounts currently on special were part of a special
purchase from the manufacturer by certain importers.

No one seems to have actually sawed one in half, so the question still
remains...is there a spring? Are they solid? Does it matter?

It's not so much the appearance... Well, I guess that's a bit of it. It's 
also the way-off gear ratios and the speedo (well, the speedometer is 
not working right now, when it DOES work it'll be way off), plus the 
thing is SO dang low... From comparing the 165/15s that WERE on it, 
it dropped the car about 1.25". I'm NOT a "low-rider" fan, but it does 
look kinda neat on the 914.

I have the stock steelies now, but I really want to move into alloys. I 
just don't like steel wheels, plus one or two of them got bent (from an 
EXTREMELY nasty pothole - the same hole bent the same wheel 
twice). I had them sandblasted and painted, so they look good, but the 
hammer marks don't help. :)

I have Comp T/A ZRs on my Shelby, and I loved 'em when the car was 
on the road. Certainly much more than the Gatorbacks that I had on 
before. But I haven't driven enough different tires to know for sure.

>a 195/50-15 and the difference was astouding.  The ride got notice-

Well, the only 914 I've ever driven is my own, and I put the 50-series 
on it before it went on the road (the dry-rotted 165s just didn't cut it), 
so I don't know how a "normal" one would handle. My car has no 
sway bars (waah!) and the springs are probably worn a bit, but it still 
handled very well, just with too much body roll. And the ride always 
seemed surprisingly good, all things considered - but I was used to the 
Shelby, which was hard as a brick. (Which is the way I like it - I like 
to feel the road.)

Basically, the pluses for the 50-series are better handling, 
responsiveness, plus they're actually cheaper for ZR tires.
Minuses are sitting too low, throwing off the gear and speedo 
readings, making the wheel-wells look oversized, etc...

Plus, when it sits that low, it's a serious pain in the butt to get a floor 
jack underneath it! :)

PORSCHING  by Chris Welty
Hudson-Champlain Region

When You Wish Upon A Star - Part III

It was a late Wednesday afternoon in LA, and we - our lungs slowly
becoming acclimated to the abundance of carbon based molecules in the
air - realized we didn't have a plan.  We were expected at the
apartment of a friend of John and mine from college, but we had no
idea how to get there.

"A car.  We need to rent a car," John said.  "And a map.  We
also need to buy a map." 

As if enough miracles hadn't already occurred, we actually found a
payphone with a yellow pages still in it (OK, look, I admit I
embellish this story in a few places, but this one is true.  No,
really, we actually found a payphone, in LA, with a Yellow Pages still
in it.  I swear, this one I didn't make up) I opened it up to Auto
Rental, and let my fingers do the walking.  It didn't take long to
find a place that not only promised cheap prices, but could send a van
over to pick us up.  After waiting about twenty minutes, I noticed a
white van cruising very slowly along the passenger pickup area.  I
immediately yelled, "Drive by!!" and threw myself to the ground,
anticipating the stocatto of automatic weapon fire.  John and Karl
ignored my warning, however, and were squinting at the van. 

"Did you say `Rocket' was the name of the place?" asked John.

"Er, yes," I responded from the sidewalk.  It was then I noticed
the words `Rocket Rent-a-car' spray painted on the side of the
van.  "I ummmm... thought it said `Rockets', the name of a
notorious street gang in East LA, " I said as I got up and brushed
myself off. 

We flagged down the van, loaded our stuff on board, and headed out for
Rocket Headquarters.  Despite a tendency to veer in the direction of
scantily clad women, our driver was able to get us to our destination,
which we mistook at first for a junkyard.  We hadn't actually
mistaken it, since it was a junkyard, but they also rented out a few
cars. After some interesting confusions about age limits and credit
card bills, we set off in our midget car in search of Porsches - 911s
to be exact. 

According to the "Illustrated Porsche Buyers Guide," a quarter of all
the Porsches ever sold were sold in Southern California.  When
combined with the generally dry air, the lack of snow and resulting
lack of salt on roads, that meant there were an extraordinary number
of prime 911s packed into the smog filled area around LA, and that
meant prices were low and some people were ready to make deals.  We
were excited.  We were lost. 

"Where are we?"

"Where's the map?"

"What map?"

"I think we're on Venturi Blvd."

"Never mind where we are, look!"

Soon it became obvious that the Buyer's Guide was right on
target. There were zillions of Porsches in LA.   Beautiful ones.
Black ones, red ones, blue ones, yellow ones, pink and orange ones
(well, one), a feast for the eyes (with a few exceptions).  We stopped
four or five times to look at cars, practising our ability to
determine the model year.  The problem is that very few californian
cars are original, so tell-tale signs like the bumpers or flares
don't easily distinguish the year.  John or Karl, however, usually
found some way to convince me they knew the year, though I was still
struggling with `T' not standing for `Targa.' 

We were looking at a black 1972 911E (the E, I learned, is for
eenjection) in a closed-for-the-day used car lot when I was suddenly
struck with memory. 

"Oh wait!  Last time I was here, I noticed a huge Porsche
dealership with a 917 in the window.  It might have been a model, but
it's worth checking it out.  It was on a big street - Sepulchura, I
think.  Let's ask someone." 

We found it pretty quickly, since it wasn't too far from the
airport. What I had seen was Vasek Polak Porsche, one of the larger
Porsche dealerships you'll find, on Sepulveda Ave.  I had actually
copied down the address on my last visit, so there was no magic
involved in finding it. There wasn't much there for us, we were
looking for deals, we wanted cars that needed some work and love, but
didn't need too much money.  Polak was not the place for such
people, but the displays were worth the trip.  That day there was a
917 and a beautiful RSR in the showroom. The salesman realized quickly
we weren't going to be buying anything, but since there were no
prospective actual buyers around, and since we were clearly fanatics,
he was more than happy to give us the tour and let us poke our noses
into and under the cars.  

There was a cutaway of a 911 engine with a sportomatic transmission,
and Karl pointed out  that the sump cover was rotated 90 degrees from
its correct position.  I had already learned to feign understanding
when there were others around, and a quick mental leap off the word
"sump" (which I recognized from experiences with failed pumps in my
basement), lead my gaze to the bottom of the engine where I noticed a
round peice of metal that could very well have been on wrong. I shook
my head knowlingly with that, "I hate when people do that" expression
on my face, and glared at the salesman.

"Only you would notice," he said to Karl. Funny how salesmen
like to pretend they know you well enough to be your best buddy.  The
guy probably didn't even know what a "sump cover" was!  I was just
about to suggest this possibility when some potential customers walked
through the door and we were forgotten.  It was probably a good thing,
the guy had been nice to us, and anyway we had promised to be at
Steve's apartment two hours earlier.

By this time we had somehow acquired a map, and we proceeded to the
UCLA area where Steve lived.  We were tempted many times to stop, but
instead we made mental notes of those places and managed to reach our
destination.  Steve lived in a nice sized one bedroom apartment, with
a kitchen, living room and dining room.  When we arrived, we found
that dinner was waiting for us in the form of tacos.  Steve's
girlfriend had taken the liberty of making them for us, even though he
had warned her it might not be a good idea.  We were pretty excited,
were just becoming aware of the fact that we hadn't eaten since the
plane (if that could actually be called eating) and didn't realize
until too late that we were eating faster than she could make new
food.

After we had devoured everything edible in the place, we headed out
for some pizza, leaving Steve (who had to get up early) with his
astonished girlfriend just gaping at the scene of destruction.  On our
way out we heard him laugh, "I warned you they eat like cows -
that's why I said we should go out for dinner."  We decided not
to eat at Steve's anymore.

The pizza was terrible, but we hardly noticed it.  The excitement had
built to a crescendo within me.  It was very late, and we were tired
from our trip, but there was no sleepiness in any of us.  We had
little choice but to drive around and visit the used car lots in the
local area, Porsches were all we could think about.  Along Santa
Monica Blvd there were a number of lots, all of which were closed, but
many had cars outside and unprotected by fence or other obstruction.

To an outside observer, we might have looked like some special FBI
used car investigative squad.  As soon as we noticed a lot with a 911
in it, we would pull over hard and come to a quick stop at the curb,
the three of us would jump out and converge on the car like
ants. Skirting the very limits of tolerence for any of the alarms
installed on the cars, we found fiberglass, welds, bondo, and other
surprises.  Even I was able to spot most of it.  Just about everything
in these lots were not what they appeared to be.   This was a sort of
"sauce for the goose" from my perspective.  At first glance, I had
about as much of a chance as identifying a car as John or Karl did.

Perhaps the FBI should have a special used car force, some of these
cars were being sold as what they looked like, but not what they were.
California, or at the very least L.A., has a reputation for being a
place where looks are everything, perhaps it was all that mattered to
most people here.  It did matter to us, though.  I was continually
thanking my lucky stars that I hadn't come alone, I might very well
have ended up with the first place car in the "wannabe" category: a
turbo-look 912.

Our first day in LA, then, ended on a rather dour note.   I had become
consumed with the fear that my fillings would fall out that night and
choke me.  More relevant to the story, I also had become obsessed with
the belief that all cars in LA were going to be like what we saw that
night: overpriced, butchered, and completely undesireable.  I had just
launched into a very heart-felt rendition of "O Solo Meo" when all the
car alarms in the neighborhood started to go off.  John and Karl
pulled me into the car and requested instead my version of "tubular
bells."

On the way back to Steve's apartment, John sensed that both Karl and I
had been disheartened by the night's experiences.  He reminded us
several times that he had come to LA and bought a Porsche earlier in
the year, and assured us that we had nothing to worry about.  By the
time we were inside, whispering in Steve's living room, he had
lifted our morale sufficiently enough that we went through the papers
we had and made lists of prospects to call in the morning.  I rolled
out my sleeping bag on the floor of the living room and prepared
myself for sleep.  The night had curbed my excitement enough for me to
reasonably expect rest.  Hope and the promise of a new day contented
me.  As I fell asleep, I gazed from the floor out the window at the
sky, but some clouds had obscured the summer stars.

From: CarcareSp@aol.com
Subject: Washing/Drying Porsche

Scott Kelley asked what to use to wash / dry a Porsche.  I will try to pour a
little water on the subject.

What is the best product to use as a car wash?  The correct answer is use
what you like best.  There are some drawbacks to certain products and
advantages to others.  Dish detergent (Ivory Liquid, etc) may be used, but rea
lize that this product is designed to remove animal or vegetable fat / grease
from fired ceramic dishes.  It looks at your Porsche's nice coat of wax with
the same hungry eyes.  If you enjoy washing and rewaxing weekly, then this is
for you.  Wax retailers love people who use dish detergent (they send the
Ivory Company Christmas cards every year)

If you prefer to have your wax last a little longer, you may consider using a
product that is specifically designed for automotive use.   The quality
products are based upon detergents instead of soaps.  Soaps are manufactured
from rendered animal byproducts (the stuff the dog food people reject).  They
contain trace elements that can actually damage your paint.  These trace
elements are the same goodies that leave a ring in your bath tub.  (Ring
around the Porsche)

Quality car wash/shampoos (same thing - most cars don't have hair) are usually
 pH controlled, contain gloss enhancers and some even have a small amount of
water soluable wax for good measure.  Use only enough car wash to break the
electrostatic/ionic bond between dirt and your Porsche.  Start with a clean
large bucket (preferably plastic - if you kick the metal bucket, Mr. paint
chip rears his ugly head), add a small amount of the car wash and fill the
bucket with cool water.  Avoid hot water as it will soften the wax.  Read the
directions on the car wash bottle and try reducing the recommended amount by
half.  I use less than a half a cap full in 5 gallons.  The more car wash,
the more wax you remove. Try to avoid powder car washes, as the undissolved
granules can get on your sponge or towel and scratch the paint surface.

Make sure that your Porsche is in the shade and the paint surface is
relatively cool.  Rule of thumb # 1: If you can comfortably hold you hand on
the hood, you can wash/wax the car.

Spray the car with a gentle spray to thoroughly wet the surface.  Don't use a
200 P.S.I. fire hydrant spray, it isn't needed and may grind the surface
grime into the paint and cause scratches.  Some of the concour purists will
not use a nozzle on the hose at all.  Start at the top of the car and work
down.  Rewet the top, gently wash the top and then rinse.  Move onto another
section, such as trunk or hood.  Rewet this area, wash and rinse.  Continue
on down the car, completing a section at a time.  This way, the car wash does
not dry on the paint.

You may use a wash mitt, towel, or sponge to wash the car.  I prefer a wash
mitt as the grit tends to work up into the long fibers and not scratch the
paint,  When I redip the mitt into the wash bucket, I give it a swirl to
release the grit.  The flat surface of a sponge can sometimes catch dirt and
act like a sandpaper.  The purist will use two wash mitts.  One for the top
half of the car (the cleanest) and one for below the trim line and
wheels/wheel wells.

Your Porsche should be dried as soon as possible.  There are several methods
to accomplish this.  Lots of towels are a great drying medium.  They should
be 100% cotton (some of the blends contain polymer fibers that scratch).
 Start at the top, lay the towel on the top and then **gently** drag the
towel across the surface of the paint to pull the water from the surface.
Change to a dry towel and blot any remaining water.  Move to the hood or
trunk and repeat. Dry the sides last as the water will usually take care of
itself on these surfaces.  Another method is to use a chamois.  There are two
types, natural and synthetic.  The natural leather chamois contain acids,
primarily tannic, that strips wax.  Most synthetic chamois don't seem to do a
satisfactory job.  One exception is the P21S Super Absorbing Drying Towel.  I
have stopped using towels after trying this goodie.  I used to be a "dyed in
the wool" towel man. 
Driving the car to dry it may be fun, but you are redepositing dirt on the
wet surface and allowing the resulting "mud" to dry on the paint.

I hope that the above brief synopsis rinses away some popular myths.  If
there are any questions, please give me a shout.

Hi everyone!  Many thanks to all of the great replies to my earlier questions!!!

Does anyone have any experiences, positive or negative, in dealing with a
company called Eurasian Parts Select, via mail-order?

A little while ago I faxed a few companies a list of all the parts I need to get
my new "baby" in tip-top shape.  This company was not only the cheapest on most
items, but the first to respond and very thorough -- so they're my top choice.
But now that I'm on Porschephiles, I just thought I'd see what others'
experiences have been...  

Thanks!!!

Yeah... There's a whole subculture of people who put 911 motors in

The group to contact is called SOTO, I think (Society Of Transporter

you can probably find it in any of the VW magazines ("Hot VWs", etc.).

If you can't find it, let me know in e-mail and I'll get the info for

	The terrycloth towel is better for your paint than the chamois, 
	although if you do use a chamois, you should get it wet first 	
	(the chamois acts more like a squeegee than an absorbent cloth). 
	After you use one a few times, in fact, it'll be impossible to 	
	use dry, since it'll be very stiff (it IS leather, after all).

	Driving the car wet is a bad idea; the water will pick up a lot 
	of dirt during your "quick spin", and you'll then grind it into 
	the paint when you dry the car.

	By the way, you should wash and dry in straight lines parallel 	
	to the direction of travel (nose-to-tail).  Circular rubbing 	
	will leave swirl marks in the paint.

	General tips:

	Get a lot of water on the car first, then wash from the bottom 	
	up.  Don't use the same sponge (or brush, or whatever) for both 
	the car and the wheels.  Speaking of wheels, don't treat 	
	them any differently than you treat the paint; the finish on 	
	those expensive Fuchs is fragile.  Also, be careful of tire 	
	cleaners; some may discolor your wheels.  Rinse from the top 	
	down, then dry the car immediately.  If possible, wash the car 	
	on a cool, cloudy day to cut down on water spots.

	Don't wax the car if the paint is warm to the touch, and don't 	
	use an orbital waxer that spins faster than 1500 RPM.

	Oh, yeah... One more thing:

	Don't obsess about all this; it's only a car.

From: Richard Kovach <76253.1567@compuserve.com>
Subject: 944 Power Steering Details

My recently-acquired 1984 944 seems to have an intermittent or variable leak.
When I was getting the car checked over prior to purchase, the shop pointed out
that there was supposedly no PS assist being provided by the pump.  I don't know
how they assessed this.  They didn't mention any leak.  This seemed a little
odd, and I noticed when test-driving (and since) that most of the time the power
steering seemed OK, but once in a while seems weak.  I've also noticed a very
small amount of leaking fluid around the pump under the hood and under the car,
but not enough for the level to be dropping much in the reservoir.  It's been
too cold out to do much serious poking around (ie. removing the skid plate to
get a clear look).

But it's got me real curious as to how the power steering works on these models.
Is there any danger of serious damage to any components from using the car with
the pump not fully functional?  Is it possible to continue use if the pump fails
completely?  

Are there parts/kits available to rebuild the pump if it's just a case of some
seal(s) going bad, and is this a job for a generally capable non-expert?  Is it
covered in the factory manuals (which I'll be getting soon)?

Many thanks,

I prefere to stay off the motorways in daylight, in the UK you can 
get faster point-to-point on the A-roads, given a 911 of course :-) 
On the motorway it is just a turkey shoot for the cops, besides they 
are so dull that I prefer to avoid them. Rolling along in a convoy with
lots of fat blokes in company cars is a prima facie case of Porsche
Abuse IMHO.

I do like to use the motorways late at night. All the traffic travels
in scattered bunches which you can see for miles, so it is possible to
pile on the power, haul in each group, slow to a reasonable 85 MPH
while doing a visual on each car. Once you have a positive view on
cop-or-not you can mash the throttle and really wind it up
while hauling in the next group. One clearly needs to maintain a
high level of situational awareness, probably a good idea at all
times in a Porsche.

This would normally be a 3 month suspension for dangerous driving.

He got of with a one week suspension based on the fact that a suspension

No probability of damage to the rack if the pump fails. It just gets very
hard to steer at low speeds. At higher speeds the effect is not so
pronounced. There are several racers on the net who run the power steering
rack without the ps pump, to eliminate the drag on the engine...

No pump rebuild kits generally available. There are used pumps available in
the $140-$160 range, depending on condition.

Of course, you have not definitely completed the diagnosis. You could have a
leaking hose that is allowing air into the system. Or you could have a rack
with a worn spot. Both of those are common failures also...

We had exactly the same sort of smell coming out of our air conditioning in our

        There's an FAQ, but it isn't very helpful on these subjects.

>Also, what is the (or, is there a) recommended wheel alignment.  He has some
>more questions, but thought this was a start.

        Step 1 when preparing for *ANY* racing endeavor--READ the RULES!
Particular alignments can put you out of some classes in some organizations.
I guess alignments are "free" in SCCA, but that's just another beef I've
got with them...
        Zone 7 PCA Stock classes are limited to -1 degree front camber,
 -1.5 degree rear camber.  Toe and castor are free, as the "stock" numbers
are fine for just about any application.
        Basically, a 914 on "street" tires will hook up better with more
negative camber.  (There *are* exceptions!)  However, tires start wearing
more quickly with more than about -0.5 to -1.0 degrees negative camber.
The problem is that, when driving on the street, you're putting more of
the car's weight on the inside of the tires, which wears them faster.
        Corner balancing, at "race weight" (e.g., no spare tire, tools,
coolers full of beer, etc., but *with* the weight of the driver) comes
highly recommended.
        Figure this whole thing is about 2-5 hours of labor ($$) on a 914.
Two hours would be unusual.  Mine took 4.  If you're in the Bay Area, try
Ken's SporTech down in Campbell.

Dave,
	Thanks for the info; Whilst I do not want to get into a discussion 
about anybody's driving, suffices to say that my 944 was eaten alive this 
morning by some guy in a diamond star laser RS turbo.  There was no way that 
you, me, Mario Andretti or anybody could have beaten this thing which needless 
to say p?!sed me off somewhat.  I BADLY wanted performance there and then 
which is why I placed the comment in the philes.  Since the word Porsche is 
normally associated with high performance vehicles a lot of other vehicle 
drivers like to race away from the lights to beat the expensive sportscar.  It 
is nice to be able to put them in their place once in a while; and this 
morning I could not succeed.  Therefore I need to either meet this guy on a 
twisty road, or bring out the 6 cylinder 24 valve bike! (yes AIRCOOLED)

I have a 84 944.  I was driving one day and it just cut out, no sputtering or
anything it just cut out.  I tried to restart it and it didn't.  After about
30 minutes it started and ran for 30 minutes and died.
After several attemps to start it a few days later it started, ran for 90
minutes and died. I checked the coil for spark and had none.  I replaced the
coil with a spare good one I had, no luck.  I then took the Computer out and
took it apart.  It looked good inside,ie no bad soldering, and put it back
in.  I also cleaned the contacts on the computer.  This time the car started
right up and ran for 7 minutes before stopping again.  No Spark again.  It
started again an hour later and ran several minutes.  I thought it was a
loose sensor so I was wiggling them around and I touched one at the rear of
the engine above the bell housing and the car died.  I could not restart it
since.
    The computer was replaced in 89 after the previous one failed( I jump
started another car) and only has 35,000 miles on it.
Does any one have a suggestion or similar experience?
Also is there available a schematic for the computer since the chips are not
labeled and  my hand book doesn't cover it.  I think I could test the
computer if I knew what the checks needed to be but haven't found any sources
of info to do this?

I was test driving an '89 944 Turbo yesterday, and the car had been garaged

dust. I always keep my car covered in the garage (unless it is dirty, which

I had a saga with the same problem a few weeks ago. The symptoms are 
identical.

We had quite a conversation on the net about it, it took we around a week 
to track down the problem.

It was very difficult to diagnose because of the fact that it kept 
clearing up.

Eventually in my case, I noticed that when ever I lost the spark, I also
lost my rear wiper - this was the clue, I figured that it must be a common
electrical wire. I did not actually find the problem, but I dropped down
the fuse panel, you know how it sort of hooks in under the glove box.
After I waggled a few wires, it wiper burst into life, and then I was able
to restart the engine. 

Looking at the wiring diag in Haynes, it is not clear if the wiper and 
ignition box are on the same wiring run, it kinda loops all around the 
back of the fuse panel, so I never found a loose connection, but since 
then I have done around 6k miles with no further problems.

Suffice to say I was very relieved, because there had been talk about 
components breaking down in the spark box, fuel pumps etc etc, someone else 
suggested water in the dizzy cap!!

So I suggest keep a x-head screw driver and some pliers in the car, and next 
time it happens drop down the fuse box and give all the red wires a 
gentle waggle.

In the mean time stay out of the fast lane on the interstate, 3 times 
before I found the problem, the car had cut whilst I was doing > 70 mph 
in the outside lane.

Good luck

Pete

Barry,

Using a car cover outside is well worth the trade-off of any  microscopic
scratches your car might get.  This, compared to the sun and pollution damage
is a good trade-off.

Never use a dirty (inside) cover or cover a dirty car.

I use a cover everyday in dry weather.  After 5 years my paint looks as new. 

As for covering your car in the garage, I used to do that but I don't think
it necessary or important unless storing your car.  Plus, you can not look at
your pretty car in the garage if it is covered.

Hi fellow Porschephiles,

A few days ago, we at Audacity, placed an e-mail release out on the 
Porschephiles list about our Exceeding the Limit service.

I was pleasantly surprised by the response; we saw quite a few "Cool, sign me 
up."  However, we received a few that said "you have the Audacity to do this!"

To all those who showed a positive interest in our service, I would like to 
thank you for your interest and assure you that the information you requested 
is on the way.  In addition, I would like to apologize on behalf of Audacity 
for any bad blood it might have caused with the Porschephiles membership.  I 
think some of the consternation we have caused can be cleared up with a little 
explanation...

I think some of the confusion stems in that we are NOT an internet list or 
home page and some people thought we are.  I could certainly see why people 
would wonder why they should pay for a service they get now for free.  We 
apologize for not making  that more clear in the release.  Our service is 
similar to what is available through the Porschephile list, but certainly not 
identical.

So, What are We?

What we are in terms of technology is the equivalent of an "American On-line" 
for Porsche owners.  We do not use the Internet for access to our system 
although in the future we may do so.  What we do is we have specialized 
Windows on-line software that is used to connect Porsche people to our server 
over normal phone lines.  We are geared up to tap into the 99% of Porsche 
owner who do not have the technical know how or the desire to get themselves 
on to the internet at this time.  We may not be right for all the Porschephile 
list's membership, however, we thatought this group would generally like to 
know about it.

I hope that should calm some agner in regards to us advertising in "another 
list", since we are in fact, not a list.

If you are unclear about our service, please call us and speak with us 
personally.  We can clear up any confusion you might have.  

Come check us out, we are growing every day.  See you on the info-bahn!

2)  I would like to get the seats redone.  The springs/foam are shot and I'd like to get new covers installed.  Anyone know a cheap way to do this (remember I am a 912 owner!)


You might consider doing it yourself, Scott.  Re-doing seats isn't
all that hard.  The springs can usually be stiffened up by binding
them together with hog rings or hardware store wire.  You can also
stuff some stiff foam in them to make them stiffer.  Beats the
price of new ones by a mile.  New foam is easy.  You can usually
buy what you need at an upholstery supply store, or even at 
a big sewing center.  It can be shaped by trimming with a sharp
blade, like a razor blade, and also by filing it with a Surefoam
file.  One technique is to build up a rough shape by gluing 
appropriately cut pieces together, and then smoothing with a blad
or file.  

As for the covers themselves, that's a bit harder to do from
scratch, although if cost really is the biggest problem you can do it.  
One way is to take apart your present covers, use the pieces as 
patterns, and cut new ones.  Vinyl, by the way, is very cheap, and
is available at all sewing centers.  If you can afford a bit more,
I'd but seat covers already made up from any of the outfits that
advertise in Pano or Excellence.  There are some companies that
specialize in interior trim, but almost all the parts suppliers
also sell seat cover kits.

One more thing.  If you decide to cut and sew the vinyl, you'll
probably have to rent a heavy duty sewing machine.  Last time
I looked, about six months ago, the cost was about $60 for
a month.  Ought to be able to sew a bunch of stuff in a month...

Have fun.

Ben, this is nearly identical to the 'states.  Packs of animals, er, I 
mean cars & drivers, clustered together increasing their probability of 
an accident.  For some reason probably deeply rooted in human behavior, 
drivers cling in groups according to the least common denominator.  
Those whose minds are still functional like to drive fast & often 
alone, breaking through these groups of people in a technique I call 
"pack jumping".

This becomes very clear from the air - if you ever get a chance, study 
a road for a while and you'll see packs come & go.  Pretty amusing.

Say, do you have toll roads in England?  If so, do you find people 
following each other blindly into toll booth lanes, ignoring open & 
empty lanes?  This is another chapter in my "Lemming Theory" of driver 
behavior.

I lift my glass to those with the minds to enjoy life in their own lane!

Tim,

I had Borla muffler installed  on my 85/2 944 last August. I purchased it
for around $480 form EuroProduct (800-962-0911). My actual invoice price
was less than the price they quoted to me on the phone, which again was
less than their 944 Special Excellence Ad price. But I wasn't going to 
complain about that ;-)

As far as the muffler is concerned it does sounds good and I do feel like
a have gained some ponies since the car has a better kick then before. The
kit comes complete including stainless clamps and fits perfectly. I did
had to replace the rubber hanger.  I took it to a local shop and they
charged me $30 for complete installation. 

I think it is worth the investment. The amount of water vapor 
exiting the exhausts on cold Chicago morning and the angle of the
installed muffler was enough to convenience me.  The thing that helped me
justify such an investment was the fact that I had convinced myself for 
keeping the car for a duration longer than the average life of normal
muffler. I also think that it is worth some money when you go and sell 
the car, as I have seen many used Porsche Ads that specify Borla muffler.

Hope this helps, My $0.02 worth is;  Go For It

If you look at the fatality statistics for Formula One, it doesn't look
nearly as safe as the public road. Never mind testing accidents; if you have
200 mile races, 15 times a year or whatever, with 26 cars in the grid,
that's only 78,000 driver-miles/year. If you kill one F1 driver every 4
years, that's a fatality rate of one per 312,000 miles. Not too good;
assuming 20K miles per year for the average public motorist, this is
equivalent to one fatality for every 15.6 driver-years.

You're explanation of "The Exceeding the Limit" service not being an Internet

obvious commercial goal. I can already see "Exceeding the Limit II:Ferrari

The "other list" is not the point. Its *NOT* about competition. It's about

It's about targeting Porschephiles being MUCH MUCH cheaper than buying a

	The Bosch Motronic system is quite well described in believe it or not

Does anyone know when the flashing lights in your rearview mirror represent
more than your standard speeding ticket?  Do the police follow a procedure
that would warrant a 'reckless driving' arrest for driving WAY too fast. Like
going double or triple the speed limit? Or does an officer always have
discretion as to what is considered EXCESSIVE? 

I know that here in Texas, if you are caught going more than 25 mph over the
speed limit, you are not permitted to take a Defensive Driving course to have
the ticket removed from your record. (You can only take a Def. Driv. course
once every 12 months to dismiss a ticket.) I was just curious if there is a
fine line between a minor traffic offense and some jail time.

I would imagine that's largely up to the office, and whatever s/he feels will
hold up in court.  I imagine that if you were driving 80 in a 55 during rush

could be ticketed for reckless driving.  OTOH, I was once pulled over for 132

Subject: Clutch confusion

I'm getting conflicting information about the clutch and transmission problems
for the 87-88 911. Most of the advise I have received has led me to believe 
that the G50 transmission with the hydraulic clutch was a better choice 
that the earlier transmission (915) with the cable activated clutch. Most of
the earlier cars I test drove were more difficult to shift than the latter models.

However, the mechanics I've talked to (three) have all indicated that the 87 & 88
model years had problems with the throw out bearing. One mechanic sighted a repair
bulletin referencing this problem. For most cars this would just be an annoying 
squeaking coming from the clutch assembly. In worst case this could lead to 
seized throw out bearing. This was changed in 89 to a thicker part. 

This is what I have been told. It may be incorrect. Any information that might
help clarify my confusion would be appriciated. Thanks.

I think the officer's discretion plays a significant role.  For example,
several years ago while living in Washingon I was driving on a freeway just
east of Seattle.  It was early morning rush hour on the southbound side but
my 6 northbound lanes were free and clear.

I was *very* late for a rather important appointment so I pushed my GTI up
to around 110 or so.  Mind you, there was not another car on the northbound
side.  About 30 seconds after reaching terminal velocity I blew past 6
motorcycle cops who were monitoring southbound traffic.

Before the officer could get his bike started and on the road I was
probably a mile ahead of him. When he came out, I immediately and carefully
slowed down, signaled all my lane changes and got off the freeway at the
first exit and pulled over to the side of the road.  Still, it took the cop
another 30 seconds or so to catch up.

I waited patiently with my license and registration ready.  The officer
came up to the car with a big grin repeating "I otta run you in".  He
questioned me regarding my speed (I was right on) and my hurry.  I knew
that I was going to jail!

Without further lecture, still with a big grin, the officer proceded to
write a ticket for 70+ (saving a reckless driving charge), admonished me in
a friendly way to watch my speed and bid me a nice day.

I suspect to this day that he probably *really* enjoyed the chase as I gave
every indication that I wasn't fleeing his "custody" when he came out after
me.  He never stopped grinning!

So, with this anectdote in mind, I suspect that any citation the officer
issues is completely at his or her discretion.  I'll never forget that
discretionary act and to this day, I remember his kindness whenever I'm
pulled over.

Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

Skatterj asked... How fast is too fast in relation to getting a reckless
driving citation.

I would think it varies from state to state.  As a former state trooper in
North Carolina, the reckless driving statute was not used in driving fast
situations without other violations.  The NC statute requires some proof
of negligence to substantiate "reckless driving" and that is difficult to
prove in court without some "gross or glaring" violation of the safety of
self or others.

Here, reckless driving is not frequently used in speeding cases.

Here's my recommendation.  Whenever I find myself in a "Gee, look's

 - Make eye contact with aforementioned knucklehead, then turn away.
 - Let your car, uhhh, I mean Porsche, roll forward just slightly indicating

 - Allow light to change green.
 - Proceed through intersection at safe speed.

Subject: 944 Engine Noise Dianosis

Hy, just to let you know, I'm new to this e-mail stuff so bear with me I'll
get it eventually.

I'm hoping to get the benefit of experience here on an engine noise I've been
hearing.

Upon full warm-up my '83 944 w/ 103K miles begins to make a light but very
noticeable and disconcerting metallic tapping noise which, although I've not
100% confirmed, appears to eminate from underneath the intake runners in the
general location of the upper balance shafts' rear bearing.  The noise's
frequency is roughly proportional to the engine's speed.  Oil pressure
remains in the 3.5 - 4.5 bar range even on extended driving.

It seems to me that the rear bearings for those purposely-out-of-balance
shafts take quite a beating and based on the April '95 issue of Excellenc mag
which shows them to be the last bearings to receive oil flow I suspect they
are asking for my attention.  Since I perform all the maintainence on this
car including belt changes (the last of which was some 20k miles ago) yet am
not formally trained in this, I fear this is what manuals vaguely caution
about when the topic of belt changes and correct tensioning comes up.

Anyone ever had or heard of this problem?  and are my suspicions accurate?

Other than that,  I love my 944 and will probably purchase another for my
wife as the beautiful concept of supply and demand have made these cars one
of the absolute best bargains around.

Rish,

I guess I am one of the people that does not like the G50. Sure, the
hydraulic clutch is easier and the more "modern" syncro systems is
easier to shift.

I like the feel of the 915. It "talks" to me more clearly and I get
a better sense of what gear I am going into. Plus, it is MUCH cheaper
to rebuild and modify. Go price a ring & pinion or gears for a G50
and prepare to pass out. Some people say the 915 is not as strong as
the G50. While this may be true, I know of 915's pumping 500+ HP and
500+ ft-lbs of torque to the ground with out problem. Yes, you have to
modify the 915 to handle this, but not extensively.

Fixing a badly damaged G50 costs as much as new Yugo!!

Subject: Notes from recent factory tour

Two weeks ago (Feb 14), I was fortunate to get a chance to tour the
Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen.  I took a few notes along the way,
so, I'll pass them on for anyone interested.  I wish I could include
some pictures, but pictures were STRICTLY VERBOTEN.

My trip to Germany was set only the Thursday before a Sunday
departure, so I had one full day in the states to try to get a tour
confirmation.  Reno tried, but couldn't pull it off.  Not willing to
give up, after I arrived in Frankfort on Monday, I called the factory
directly, and, since I had come all the way from the U.S., they agreed
to slip me into the already-full tour the following day.

The factory is easily accessible by the excellent Stuttgart subway,
although I almost mistakenly got off at the Zuffenhausen stop rather
than the closer Neuwirtshaus stop.  From there, the factory is right
across the street.

Before the tour, I had 45 minutes to spend in the museum.  In addition
to 20 or so older Porsches, some of racing fame, the museum has a
small gift shop, a movie to watch, and a video game.  I even plunked
down the 2 marks to play the video game, which was a typical race car
game, but in this case the display was a large-screen on the wall, and
the game control was ... you guessed it ... an actual 911.  The 911
steering and accelerator were wired up to take the place of the joy-
stick (some-how this seems turned around).  Come to think of it, I
didn't think to try the brakes to see if they worked, too.  All-in-
all, the museum was interesting, but it's not large, and I found 45
minutes was plenty of time.

The tour included about 20-30 people, and was split into three groups
(one English-speaking, and 2 German-speaking).  We saw three shops -
engine assembly, final assembly, and upholstery.  All were highly
interesting, and all gave the image of careful, well organized,
quality work, although with a very manual slant compared to today's
most automated plants.

Our first stop was the engine shop.  Every engine worker can build an
entire 911 engine, but in practice each of the 24 workers on the
engine assembly line carefully dedicates themselves to one specific
task for 1/24th of the engine.  The climax is at the end of the engine
assembly line, when each engine is taken to a test chamber, and tested
at high RPM for problems and for proper power output.  They are proud
that only 3% are rejected and have to go back for rework.  That's down
from 5% in the past.

Our second stop was the final assembly shop, where the body is joined
to the chassis.  The line moves VERY slowly, with maybe 30 or so 911
bodies being slowly carried by an overhead conveyor system, and with
the corresponding chassis moving along on an underneath conveyer
system.  Then at one point - presto - one more body and chassis come
together and look like a car.  This sight was impressive, and I
pleaded with the guide to let me take just one picture.  I could have
made a great poster.  But, not a chance!

This assembly line moves at .6 meter/minute, whereas a highly
automated line might move at 10 times that rate.  Porsche wants to
speed things up, but taking it all the way to the Toyota or Nissan
level isn't justified at the Porsche volumes.  The line is flexible in
that different car types (911, 968, ...) can be intermixed.  But, I
saw only 911's.  With the low volume of the others, you'd have to hit
it just right to spot anything else.

Our last stop was the upholstery shop, which was more interesting than
I had expected.  We saw 50-100 people, mostly women, carefully, and
slowly, cutting, gluing, and stitching leather dashes, arm pieces,
etc.  No automation here, unless you count the few sewing machines.
The presence of these women contrasted sharply with the other shops
where there was hardly a woman to be found.  The completed pieces were
a real work of craftsmanship, and this operation, maybe more than any
other I saw that day, really brought home to me one reason a Porsche
costs more.  At one point the guide picked up a small piece (an arm
rest?), perhaps a foot long, and said `each worker produces 8 pieces
like this per day'.

The remaining notes don't line up specifically with any of the three
shops, but come from various comments the guide made throughout the
morning.
  
 . The Per-day production is now 86 911s, 2 928s, and 2 968s  (I know
   - that's slightly above the 60 per day that the Porsche sales
   video claims)
 . Manufacturing of 968 parts is now over, and they will keep making
   968's until the parts stock runs out.  This should take
   approximately 2 months.
 . The top three markets for Porsches are:  U.S. 6000, Germany 5700,
   and Japan 1500.
 . The guide said there are NO plans to build a U.S. Porsche plant -
   `Porsches have long been built in Germany;  when a customer buys a
   Porsche they expect it to be built in Germany;  and, that's the
   way it will continue to be.'  (Of course, a tour guide, who meets
   with the public daily, might be the LAST in the company to be told
   of such plans)
 . One 911 takes 12-17 days to produce.  Those who arrange for
   factory pick-up of a new 911 can enter the factory to watch their
   car's production at any point during that time.  The major parts
   (e.g. engine) are ticketed with the car's ID, so the owner-to-be
   can find their car parts and follow them around.  (This amazed me
   - that their manufacturing organization would bend so far for the
   customer)
 . I had known that the 924 had high Audi content, but I was
   surprised to learn that both the 924 and the 944 were manufactured
   by Audi in an Audi plant.  Only with the evolution to the 968 did
   production actually move to the Porsche plant.  Even so, the 924
   and 944 were two of the biggest money-makers for Porsche.
 . Improved productivity is a consistent theme throughout the plant,
   and is one of the current president's greatest contributions.  He
   even contracted Toyota to advise Porsche on manufacturing methods.
   A few examples of the changes:
     . Total human labor in a 911 is now 80 hours, down from 120
       hours two years ago.  And, it will drop further.
     . For 1995, the goal is an additional 6% productivity increase.
       Signs throughout the shops remind the workers of this.
     . Each worker is required to submit 12 improvement suggestions
       per year.  Awards, such as dinner in Paris, are given for the
       best suggestions.
     . The number of suppliers to Porsche has been reduced from 900
       to 300.  And, suppliers who don't meet their delivery
       deadlines get some unwelcome publicity - their names are
       posted conspicuously in the plant, for all to see.
 . Early orders for Boxters look good - 6000 so far.


The tour was well worth the time.  The quality you find in your
Porsche car can also be found everywhere at the factory.  And even
though Porsche is clearly watching productivity and production costs,
I never felt that the workers were being hurried at the expense of
quality.

If any of you are in the Stuttgart area, be sure to set aside some
time for (and don't forget to prearrange) the tour.  If you can't get
on the tour, the museum might be worth visiting if you're already in
Stuttgart, but whether further travel for the museum is worth it to
you depends on how badly you want to see some older Porsches.  I'd
like to go back, myself, and I'm sure I'd take in more a second time.
Better yet, anyone know how to get into Weissach!

This phenomena has been studied and various theories have
been advanced as to the cause. In fact, some applied
mathematicians have even tried modelling these "traffice waves."
The fatal flaw with these theories is that they assume some sort
of cognition by the drivers. ;-) Actually, that is not true; cognition
is not an assumption. If I remember correctly from my
applied math class, the only assumptions that became
coefficients in the discrete-step (non-linear) differential equation
was the density, speed, and average braking reaction time.

In fact, I think the traffic wave theory can be blamed for the
on-ramp metering systems that have been foisted on many
of us. I wonder how much of this can be attributed to traffic
"engineers" in the public employ trying to justify their jobs.
(I know, traffic metering supposedly actually increases the
overall throughput of a section of highway, but I find that little
consolation while waiting several minutes in the on-ramp line
before I can get on the freeway. Do the traffic engineers know
how many folks actually take an alternate route rather than wait
to use a particular on-ramp and factor that into their analysis?
That probably wouldn't be taken into consideration since they
have met their goal of increasing the average speed of
that particular stretch of roadway.)

Doesn't F1 hold the dubious distinction of the most people killed in

The point was that for most of us, racing is probably safer than driving the

Subject: 	Clutch confusion

I'm getting conflicting information about the clutch and transmission problems
for the 87-88 911. Most of the advise I have received has led me to believe 
that the G50 transmission with the hydraulic clutch was a better choice 
that the earlier transmission (915) with the cable activated clutch. Most of
the earlier cars I test drove were more difficult to shift than the
latter models.

However, the mechanics I've talked to (three) have all indicated that
the 87 & 88
model years had problems with the throw out bearing. One mechanic
sighted a repair
bulletin referencing this problem. For most cars this would just be an
annoying 
squeaking coming from the clutch assembly. In worst case this could lead to 
seized throw out bearing. This was changed in 89 to a thicker part. 

This is what I have been told. It may be incorrect. Any information that might
help clarify my confusion would be appriciated. Thanks.

You're not the only one - the hydraulic clutch feels too much like
practically every other car on the market.  I *like* the feel of the
cable operated clutch.  In fact that was what made up my mind when I

Notes to porschephiles:  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

1. Lab 1 was taking apart a small Briggs and Stratton engine, measuring
compression ratio and valve timing, and reassemble. My technician insisted that
we add a sentence  "Loosen the head bolts by turning the rachet
counterclockwise". He said  it was required because of 
past experience(!!) with entry-level engineering  students <sigh>. 

2. Lab 2 was a review of principles of operation and preliminary measurements
in a water brake, an eddy-current, a magnetic clutch dynamometer, and a 
compressed air driven turbocharger in which the compressor acts as the power
absorber and the turbine (use your imagination) acts as the "engine delivering
power to the dyno". 
Maximum turbo speed is 150,000 rpm, so this could be used to test 
T*d's special high-speed low-power autocross engines. (Come to think of it, 
150K rpm isn't fast enough. This is a power-to-weight ratio argument, 
so most post-T*d porschephiles will not understand this anyway. Apologies for
the digression).  

3. Lab 3 will be thermal efficiency measurements using a Ford Ranger engine
mounted on the water-brake dyno. That engine has been equipped with a special
controllable fuel-injection system. I will try to obtain the full fuel map, ie
as much as I can from idle to max speed and low to max power (see earlier
posting on why one needs to change gears occasionally). 

4. Lab 4 will be friction measurements on the same engine by comparing the
output of all cylinders running versus all minus one running with spark plug
removed. I will try to do this at various speeds and equivalent powers and see
if friction is directly proportional to engine speed. Place your bets early.

5. Lab 5 will obtain the compressor and turbine operating maps, again from min
to max speeds, and see how often you can surge the compressor   ==8-0.   

6. Lab 6 is play with the injection while measuring efficiency and emissions on
the Ford engine running on regular gasoline and on M85 (a mix of 85% methanol
and 15% gasoline). 

7. In examples (lectures 1 and 2) I showed them pictures of slow speed marine
diesels, in which the bore is about 0.9 m (1 yard) in diameter, and the stroke
is 2.5 to 3 m. You should see their eyes pop...

8. I got a chance to make a comment about "rice burners who aspire to be
exotics". By now they have found out about Ginger (Blutorange 911 SC) and
Blondie (yellow 911 Carrera), so in response I got a few feigned-shock remarks
with all-knowing smiles. Little rascals, after spring break I will show them
the article about the twin-turbo 930 in European car.

9. I am having *A LOT* of fun with this class, and so do the students.

10. I am still looking for a 911 engine to mount on the eddy-current dyno. For
now I have a Mitsubishi engine on that dyno, and an SM student checking the
effect of 3 different turbochargers on engine performance.

Subject: Driving in UK/USA


I remember driving like Ben a few years ago in the Northeast of England.
Past midnight, returning on the M? from Morpeth (where my then girlfriend 
and now better half lived) to Gosforth. Doing well over 100 mph in a 
yellow Ford Cortina (my first car). I came up at high speed to the 
car in front - all dark. I pulled over to overtake at a safe distance,
and ***SH*T**, I saw it was a jam sandwich! 

Explanation to our US friends: A jam sandwich is basically a white
car with a red or blue stripe about mid height all around it, 
with two policemen inside. It your regular police cruiser. 

So I slammed the brakes and did not overtake. I slowed down to legal speed
and followed the jam sandwich to the Gosforth exit. I thin I did see the 
jam sandwich rock a few times as the constables inside were rolling in 
laugher at my reaction.

Two weeks later the rusted cross member of the Cortina fell off in a 
busy city street, and got towed to a gas station, lopsided. 
I was leaving the UK in a week, and the garage mechanic gave me 
50 pounds (sterling) for the roadkill. I'm glad the cross member 
didn't fall off in an M-something or A-something, or I might have been 
history.

Two years ago on I-64 from Washington University to home in 
a rallye yellow 924: Clear road ahead, and I am trying to see
if the rattle is engine-speed dependent (it's a 4-gear 1987).
60 mph and 3000 rpm (in 4th) - clear road, some rattle.
Step a little on it, 70 mph, about 3500 rpm, TOO MUCH RATTLE.
A little more, 80 rpm, about 4000 rpm, still clear ahead, less rattle!
Digress a little, think about that problem on the latest research 
paper....
Clear road ahead, mash it, over 85 mph, over 4500 rpm, no rattle!
But the radar detector goes nuts, so I slamm the brakes, where the 
hell is he, glance over the mirror **SH*T** - 
A JAM SANDWICH FROM THE LOCAL TOWN 1/2 MILE BEHIND ME.

This was over 85 mph in a 55 zone. I tried to explain about the rattle 
and the research paper, to no avail. The policeman was very polite, 
and kind too. He said he clocked me once "well over 80 mph" and 
immediately afterwards at 75 mph (they need two counts). He said 
that my detector (which was still going nuts) worked. 
And he gave me a ticket for going 70 mph in a 55 mph zone.
He greeted me "slow down a bit, Doc" (he had asked where I work and 
what I do).

The next day my lawyer got a bonus to convert the traffic ticket
to a parking ticket, and the local City of Town and Country 
collected a parking ticket more expensive than the traffic ticket.

Life goes on...

I don't agree with washing from the bottom up for the following reasons:

1) You end up washing the top dirt down unto the (already) clean bottom
2) There is typically more dirt and grime on the bottom, that will end
   up on the top to some degree.

Rish,

I don't know about the throw-out bearing.  I do know that Porsche
increased the diameter of the release lever pivot as well as
the needle bearings that ride on it.

Older G50's can be updated.  There is a tool they sell, believe
it's number 9292, which is used to widen the bores in the case
for the release pivot.  I believe you need to purchase a new release
arm and pivot.  The tool costs about $90.  PCNA used to rent or
lend such low-use tools out, but appear to have discontinued
doing so.

Unless you have a problem with the clutch, and until you drop
the engine to replace it, I wouldn't worry about this.  To my
limited knowledge, the pivot has not been a huge problem for
people.

You may have had a harder time shifting 915's than G50's
because the ones you drove were older and so had tired
synchros.  The G50 is, by all accounts, a stronger part.  However,
both it and the 915 are fine and beautiful things.

Subject: G50 Throw Out Bearing Problems

Someone referred to a problem with the throw our bearings on early G50
transmissions.

What happened was there was a problem with noise and non-smooth operation of
the clutch release mechanism. There are two "repairs".

One is the late throw out bearing (950 116 080 07), which has a sleeve of
slippery material on the inner surface where it slides on the guide tube.
Because this sleeve effectively makes the inside diameter smaller, a
different guide tube must also be installed.

The other fix is to remove the transmission (!), ream out the bushings where
the cross shaft resides, and replace them with new, better ones.

There are factory bulletins on both fixes.

The thing that scares me about the "officer's discretion" part of this

the "cream of society's crop".  I feel that the police around here (Alabama)
are basically rednecks with guns riding around in police cars.  I'm sorry,
I don't trust 'em.  Most people on the roads are idiots (or normal people
who don't pay any attention - I don't know which) and I have seen no
indication that the police are any better.  Police around here routinely
violate traffic laws.  The worst thing I've seen is a police officer turning
on his lights to get people out of his way so he wouldn't have to wait
for the light to change at a busy like everyone else.  He turned off his

Scott,

I've adjusted my 40IDF carbs following the procedure in the Haynes
manual.  I used a straight edge and a set of calipers to measure the
clearances.  There is no need for special float level gauges and there
is no need to adjust the float level while the car is idling.  In
fact, I can't imagine how one could possibly do that!

Subject: G50 Transmission

Shirish Dandekar expressed concern about a throwout bearing problem on G50s.
I think the problem he's talking about is actually with the bearing release
fork, and the consequence is typically just an overly stiff clutch action
(which admittedly defeats the purpose of the hydraulics). Over time my G50
911 developed a pedal at least as stiff as my former 915 car with the
mechanical clutch. When I did a clutch replacement, I had the mechanic also
do the factory update on the bearing fork (extra $100 or so). Result: very
smooth, easy clutch.
Of course it would be rather expensive to do this if you weren't replacing
the clutch anyway. 

Apart from the clutch, I don't think you'll notice much difference between
the 915 and the G50. 

Now ... (unrelated matter) ... any of you bright boys or girls know how 
to fortify the swaybar brackets so the damned things don't keep breaking?

Subject: Color Sanding

Hi P-Philers,

I took my '70 911E Targa to one of the reputable shops, specializing in
German cars, here in So Cal. to discuss a couple areas on the hood I needed
advice on.

They suggested I Color Sand the hood to see what the outcome is before
thinking about having to strip to metal and repaint. I had a feeling this may
be what was needed and I need to work on it before the Concours season starts
up again.

The car had been painted by a highly reputed Hot Rod Shop in Orange County.
Now, before you think I was bonkers to do so. The car had P Cancer in various
spots and this Hot Rod Shop does the best metal work I have ever seen.  The
only problem is a couple areas on the hood did not turn out as nice as the
rest of the car.

After that long winded explanation, I need advice. 

I have the 600, 1500, 2000 grit sandpapers and  a special rubber block for
wet sanding. Is there anything else I need (besides faith)?

Does anyone have advice on how to keep the pressure as even as possible while
sanding? Or any suggestions at all that may help me out!! 

I have a variable speed Porta Cable sander/polisher that is great to use. But
since I am wet sanding, I am not sure if this is advisable. Is it??

Help!!!!

You know, back in the Old Days, one of my compatriots got DAMNED tired

set up a "braindead newbie" list that you could *ONLY* get off of by
sendind a note to the "-request" address. Offered to many of us that if
we had people that sent such notes to our lists that we could just
bounce that note to a private address he'd set up, and they'd automaticly
get added, no charge, no fuss. From then until they figured out how to get
off, they'd get *tons* of mail from other people that consisted primarily
of "how do I get off this list" and "could someone please take me off this 
list" with a weekly recording welcoming them to the braindead newbie list...

I hear that it took some people close to a year to get off...

Subject: RE: How fast is TOO fast?

here in Washington State they can and often times will throw a 
Reckless Driving at you if u are going 20 or more mph over posted.

i've never had the luck of "running into" an officer whilst said officer
was in a good mood.

my first experience with this was at about 120mph in my old
mx6 turbo.  ended up face down in the back of the police cruiser
(can't stop yourself from falling when your hands are restrained
behind yo back and you are pushed in with no regard as too
your safety) with a bloody nose.  the guy also bent my glasses
whilst he was rolling me down the side of my car (yes, scratching
the paint) and pushing my face into the back windshield.

mind you, this was my first run-in with the law and i was too frightened
and stunned to be resisting or abusive.

then the guy wanted to know what kind of firearms i like best.  hmm...

my second experience was at 3 am on my way back from northern cal
having just picked up my '89 930S Targa.  they thought i was racing
some mazda pickup.  really...

the cop never got an accurate reading on me but the attorney i have
on retainer (same one Bill uses BTW) mentioned that
a police cruiser at full throttle is well known to be going faster then
65 mph.  i might point out that even a stock 930S at full throttle is well
known to be going faster then 160 on the flat.  but anyone who's 
driven a targa knows that full throttle runs tend to be short due to
limitations of the human ear.  so, noone really knows how fast it
was...

this officer had more of a sense of humor though.  he mentions in
his affidavit that whilst sitting on an overpass on nb i5 "when
defendant passed underneath the overpass shook..."

also, this particular officer used the word "nemesis" in a complete
sentence.  extra points :):)

however since i steadfastly refused to discuss any aspects of
the case with him he told me that "it was ok to talk now.  he wasn't
going to ask about the incident" and then proceeded to make
small talk ("where'd you get the car.  what do you do.  etc.").
of course he quoted me in the affidavit in an attempt to bias
the judge against me (how relevant to the supposed crime is 
the purchase price of the car? answer: not.  its relevant only
in calculating max fine (ie: taxation)).  reduced to negligent,
write check, go home, write check to insurance agent,
repeat last...

having someone else in the car helps.  then you will be less
likely to get bloodied by over zeallous law inforcement
officials and if you do you'd have a witness.  also, if
the cop isn't too mad (in either definition) (s)he may
just let your friend take posession of the car instead
of impounding it.  this greatly simplifies matters once
you get out of, err, umm, that unplanned rest stop...

Jan, if you bought a 944 expecting to outdrag everything on the street, you

well-balanced sports car that's a lot of fun for the knowledgable enthusiast
to drive.  One visit to a race track during an SCCA or PCA event will show
that there are numerous cars that outclass the 944 (pick your parameter:
acceleration, top speed, even handling).  Street racing is for the immature;
however, since you own a car that the immature don't normally buy, I'll
assume you don't fit that category.  Responsible Porsche drivers carry a
large enough burden on the street without the immature adding to it with such
antics.  Do your racing on the track, where it belongs and where the rest of
us will be glad to give you your chance at being a winner.

No Turbo Cup cars were brought to the US by Porsche in 89. Porshce DID bring

cars had more mods than the Turbo Cup cars since they had to race against
Corvettes, etc.  The Turbo Cup Series were run in Canada, Germany and South
Africa.  Turbo Cups had cross ventilated brake rotors, suspension mods with
coil overs at all four corners, roll cage, no power steering, no sunroof, no
air conditioning, 8 and 9 inch magnesium phone dial pearlescent white wheels,
hard or solid bushings in the suspension, larger front and rear sway bars,

Yes, Eric, even before mathematicians discovered this phenomena it was part

 The models we used worked quite well (just as I suspect those used by

well).  It's not that complicated if you simply model the mechanics (which

speed up!  well they chased me for about a mile, i went thru stopsigns
lights, crossed double lines, but finally at a major intersection the
light was red, and i had to stop.
the cops jumped out pushed the bike down, and took my keys.  first
thing they said was 'you better have a license for this thing'
so i went thru the motions of looking for my license, and made up a 
story about leaving it at my girlfriends house.  so they asked me for id
i gave them a credit card, they went to the squad car and called it in,
so they leave me, (sans keys) and go to the station to check my name; BUT GOT 
NOTHING, evidently in ny when your license is revoked, you just
disapear, so they asked me if my license had been revoked, i said no
but that i did have a plates problem at one time.  well 5 tickets later
they let me go, but did joke that if i had a bigger bike i couldv out

Sand by hand do not use the sander. You may have trouble if the paint is 
old. Use the 2000 grit if you just trying to "level" out the paint. I 
know on my Carrera hood I tried to "fix" it up by sanding and I really 
didn't work. But I also had some good rock chip holes and never got it 
to work right and ended up repainting it.  Good luck give it a shot!!!

Hi Bev:

Re: Color Sanding:

I recently attended a "workshop" that covered color sanding on a yellow Jag
E-type hood.  Here was their method:

        1) hand-sand w/lots-o-water at 1000 grit
        2)  "    "   "      "       "  1500 grit
        3)  "    "   "      "       "  2000 grit (optional)
        
    then, using an 8"-10" orbital polisher/buffer (low speed),        
        4) buff with synthetic chemical buffing cream using sheepskin pad
        5)  "    "   3M Finesse-It II using lambswool pad
        6)  "    "   3M Perfect-It using a waffled foam pad
        
The results were pretty impressive.  The above is not meant to be a blatant
advertisement for 3M products, etc., it's just that this is what they use
and they feel pretty strongly about their choice.        

Their buffer was electric and vari-speed, and they did this all outside in
broad and bright daylight. The foam pad is particularly improtant as it
avoids heat-build-up, and Perfect-It is designed for use with this type of
pad.

True, but then, GM hasn't made anything that lasts in the past 30 years. 
Every Buick (the last 4 cars daily drivers prior to the Toyota) has had a 
shorter and shorter lifespan... And none of them have still made it as 
far as the 73 Porsche (yet this month, our last GM gets taken to da dump 
as it has been totalled twice in its life, rebuilt more than twice 
(tranny and engine) and still ain't nothin' to get excited about)

Remember, the UAW does it their way, and not ours... (I guarantee you 
that there are probably not any Toyotas that roll off the line with a 
defective window switch and and defective windshield washer pump (there's 
safety!) as did the '85 Buick)

Gr. The Porsche still lives even though it has had more road experience, 
and could still beat the socks off most cars out on the road (if only it 
had insurance.... *snif*)

anyone care to comment on whatis the best clutch
for a 944 turbo that is primarily track driven? Would

Funny you should ask! I just posted this a couple of days ago:
Hi gang!
	Here's a follow up on a problem I had with my car (85.1 944):

I was getting a rattling noise from the engine, driver's side any time I
decelerated and the rpms dropped from about 3K to 2K. It sounded like marbles!
It drove me nuts...

I searched around and found that the noise was comming from below the intake
manifold. By placing my hand on top of the upper balance shaft cover, I could
feel the rattling. 

Some people suggested that it might be trans noise. Well, I'm happy to report
that after changing the rear bearing on the bal shaft the noise has gone away!

My theory is that perhaphs the belt could have been overtightened at some
point, applying too much force to the whole shaft and making the bearing fail.
It could also be caused by normal wear (@ 95K miles).
=================================

Here's what I did to change it...
Remove air cleaner, belt covers, belts, etc. Make sure that you lock the 
engine at TDC on #1 cyl. I have a factory tool that that makes this a one person
operation. You must loosen up the crankshaft pulley, about 250ft#. It helps to
have the tool.

Since you are going to go through the hassle of taking the front of the eng
apart, might pay to do belts, rollers and oil seals for the balance shafts.
You will need the tool to adjust the belts. Or eyeball them and have them 
done shortly afterwards... You will need a pin spanner to loosen up the
sprockets for the BS.

Now for the cam bearings. In order to get to all the bolts that hold the cover
in place, the intake manifold must be loosend up. I just did this last week,
here's my procedure...

Loosen up the intake manifold bolts (8), loosen up two bolts that hold the fuel
rail to the valve cover (10mm wrench). By doing this, you will not have to 
remove the fuel rail from the IM and get new injector seals. THen again is your
call. I just did this a few months ago, so I was not going to get new inj. seals

Remove the bolt that holds the oil dipstic support from the IM, also one bolt
that supports the IM from the engine mount. Remove acc cable from IM support.

Loosen up the big air hose at the front of engine, there is one hose that
connects to the bottom of the IM (all the way in the back) using a long screw
driver. I also loosened one of the hoses by the head temp sensor.

There is enough slack on the FI hoses to allow you to lift the IM about 2-3".
Just enough to get to all the bolts for the BS cover. I used twine to lift it
from my garage ceiling. Connected to the front and back of the IM. I also used
a short piece of wood by the valve cover to hold that side of the IM up. It
looked pretty funny :) THere were 4 or 5 strings going up to the ceiling.
I felt like Repetto with my Pinoccio 944 :)

Remove the front nose piece (holds the F oil seal) from the BS (13mm socket x3)
Loosen all bolts on the BS cover. Do it on an alternating pattern, you don't
want to warp it. Some of them take a little to get to them, different wrenches
and or sockets. Nothing major. Once lossened, remove the cover.

The shaft is held in place by the front bearing (in F cover) and a single
rear bearing. I used original size on my car (95K miles). Two bolts allow you
to get to bearings. Coat them with grease during assembly. I paid like $19
from Porsche. There was noticeble up/down play on my shaft!

During reassembly, i coated the BS cover with Form-a-gasket. There is a rear
circular cover that uses a rubber oil seal. I reused it coating the mating 
surfaces with goo. I'm cheap. Torque as per specs following cross wise pattern.

Reassembly is the reverse. Make sure all your hoses are back in place and
tight. Oh yeah, there are two small hoses that go to the FI presure damper,
and a vacuum valve that should come off from the FI body. They have curved
connctors.

I spent about 6 hrs doing the whole thing. My engine is much quieter now. Still
getting some vibes at about 4K. Just ordered LBS bearings. Will do them next 
week.

Also, I found a snapped bolt in the front A/C mounting bracket about 1 month
ago while checking for the noise. It added to the vibration problem...

Hope this helps!

Hiall,

What a wonderful day,...days are getting brighter, temperatures are climbing 
and my '58 model should be ready for a paint job any day now.

Even as well, the '62 model I purchased around christmas has arrived in 
Gothenburg. I'm off collecting it next week. Another Porsche 356 leaving the

        I am going to my first PCA Drivers Ed event on March 12, at Summit
Point, and have some questions for anyone who is going to this event or
has participated in Potomac PCA events.
 
        I will have my 911 tuned up, and have the alignment checked before
the event.  I have new pressure feed chain tensioners installed, and will
be installing new brake pads (street type), and bleeding the brakes with
street type brake fluid.  I feel for my first event I do not need to worry
about purchasing speciality pads or high temp brake fluid (am I wrong?).
Anything else to check before the event.  I have not received the
confirmation paperwork back from Potomac PCA yet, I guess that will answer
some of my questions.
 
        As for the organization of the event, and time schedule.  I will
need to mount my track/autox tires on the car after I drive the 3 hours to
Summit.  How early does the track/registration open in the morning, do I
have time in the morning to swap tires before the beginner program starts?
Or should I plan to swap the tires the night before in the hotel parking
lot?
 
        What should I expect as a beginner for my first event?  I expect
there will be some classroom, and possibly an instructor drive session to
point out the line, then several track sessions with the instructor.

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

     To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other 
administrative issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

     If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you
feel moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all
of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow
mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want to
convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          Principal, 
          Technology Tranfer Associates
          P.O. Box 2087
          Bellaire TX 77402-2087

          e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
          voice:  (713) 661-2084 

     His Porsches currently include:  
          '64 356 SC (daily driver)

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

Are there any suggestions on how I should submit to the list?

     Beyond using normal good sense and discretion, you can submit
whatever you like that is relevant to Porsches.  You might want to use
descriptive "Subject" lines, including the model number when it is
relevant (e.g., "944 S2 Fuel leak query").  Your submissions would be 
easier for others to read if you make sure that your mailer wraps 
lines of text at 80 characters or less.

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

     Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/archives.
Archives in six subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95) each of which 
has the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.  Mac and Windows versions
of "uncompress" are available via FTP from /pub/porschephiles/programs.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: In the FAQs directory there is this FAQ and there are FAQs 
for specific Porsche models (so far there's one for 914s and one for 
the Carrera models -- feel free to contribute one on YOUR favorite 
Porsche).  These are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/FAQs.
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.

     PCA racing info: The PCA Club Racing Newsletter is now on-line,
thanks to the tireless efforts of the editor.  This is available by FTP 
in the directory tta.com:/pub/porschephiles/PCA/ClubRacing.  The 
newsletters are available both in PostScript and in Windows Write 
format.  If this is useful to you, send your thanks to the editor, Tom,
at "tt911@ibm.net".
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     Logo contest: Several Porschephiles logos have been submitted;
check them out and choose one you like, or develop your own candidate.
Someday maybe we'll decide on a winner, and then we can have T-shirts,
coffee mugs, stationery, etc., made up.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about other Porsche-related WWW links?

     There are several WWW home pages related to Porsches, and more will
undoubtedly appear (if you know of any others, please submit them):  

     http://192.253.114.31/Stuttgart/Porsche/Porsche_contents.html --

     page

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state/country of residence, their car's year and model, and
their net address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the
information, and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out
on a monthly basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't
send your Alfa Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send
submissions or changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche.  That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get
access to Panorama, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner.  Just don't
tell them you did that or where you got the idea...

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

	Porsche Club of Americia.
	P.O. Box 10402
	Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Nann Weissenberger is also on the
list, and is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com".  She'd be more 
than happy to help you out.

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     If you own a North American Porsche, Porsche Cars North America 
will, for a fee of $20, research the original bill of sale for your car
and give you a Certificate of Authenticity stating the facts and 
figures for the car as it was delivered to the dealer.  If you're

Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  A similar service is
available in Great Britain from Porsche Cars Great Britain, for about
30 pounds Sterling.  Porsche AG can also perform a similar search.

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What are the model numbers of cars related to the Porsche name?

     The following list was extracted from _Illustrated_Porsche_Buyers_
Guide_, _Porsche_Specials_, _Cars_Are_My_Life_, _We_At_Porsche_, and
the article "Project Porsche, The Early Years" in the June '83 issue of
_Thoroughbred_&_Classic_Car_.  It includes only more or less complete 
automobiles designed by Ferdinand Porsche or by the Porsche factory.  
Components (engines, transmissions, etc.) have not been included.  
The list is incomplete, in part because there has apparently been 
imperfect record keeping at the factory.  In addition, the nature of the
list has changed over the years from an in-house listing of project 
numbers to a market-driven listing.  Additions and corrections are 
welcomed:

            but not part of the "official" model sequence.

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed
alphabetically, have been praised by various Porschephiles:

What references are available for information about Porsches?

     There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for 
you depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

     The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the 
technical articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of 
their Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's 
executive office.

     What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  If 
you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note: there's 
not much information about water-cooled cars; those with favorites 
should submit them to the name at the end of this FAQ.)

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."

     Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.
If something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you

Subject: Re: 912 Question (redoing seats)

I'd like to second Bob's comment about redoing the seats yourself.  I'm not
sure what the construction of your particular seat is like, but I know all
about the '73 Recaro seats (I assume they are original).

First off, if you want to redo them in vinyl, the vinyl you find at sewing
places (at least the ones around here) will not cut it.  You need to find
some heavy, reinforced vinyl suitable for seats, not for dust covers.  In
fact, because the existing vinyl on your seats has been stretched and warped,
it will be difficult to create a correctly fitting replacement by yourself - I
would go for one of those kits.  Last time I looked, they were about $300 for
the pair of seat covers from Twinks.

The foam in my seats was reasonably intact and wasn't disintegrating, but it
was kind of mashed, particularly the seat inserts.

The metal frame that made up the driver's side seat had broken at some point
and been rewelded.  Unfortunately, they didn't make sure it was straight before
fixing it and thus the seat back had a really noticable twist in it.  First
order of business was to cut their old weld out and weld it back in the
correct position.

I ended up redoing my seats in fabric (actually sofa fabric remnants) for a
total cost of around $20.  The fabric has a nice water-proof rubber backing,
and its beige color blends pretty well with my sun-bleached brown carpet.  It's
not original, but it feels a hell of a lot better on your legs during the
summer than vinyl and the price is right.  I was also able to sew it on a
standard sewing machine - didn't include the piping though.  It was also easier
to go back and modify the fit, since the stretched vinyl templates didn't give
that great of an initial fit.  Bob's right - to sew vinyl you need an
industrial sewing machine.  Don't try it on a regular sewing machine or you
will break it ($$$).  Figure with piping, you've got 4 layers of vinyl
to go through.

The seat bottom of my seats consisted of a tightly stretched elastic mesh, not
springs, upon which the seat insert rested.  The mesh was totally rotted, so I
strung tightly stretched elastic waistbands across the frame ;-).  This worked
pretty well, but you have to find another way to fasten the fabric/vinyl along
the edges.  Originally upholstery staples were used (like the kind used to
fasten springs to the interwoven "belts" in furniture) and the edges were
stapled to the mesh - I used the plastic cable ties like those used in
electronics work.   All of the fabric edges that need tied down have metal
rods in them - just cut a little bit of the fabric at the tie down point and
slip the cable tie around the internal rod.  Works great.  It's also easy to
take apart, and they don't rust ;-).

In retrospect, my second seat definitely looks better than the first.  Sort
of a learning curve kind of thing.  One thing you might want to do if you use
fabric is to scotch-guard the seats.  I've noticed a blue tinge on the driver's
seat, probably from my blue jeans and some blue shorts that I wear.  Also, you
should tie the ends of each line of stitching that you use, otherwise it will
start to pull out after time.  This is particularly important for the cross-
stitching on the seat inserts.  I did that on the second seat, but not the
first.

Subject: re: How fast is TOO fast


          In  regards to Skatterj's question, I agree that it'll depends on 
          the officer.  I had to very different experiences (albeit in 
          different states).  A number of years ago I was clocked by an 
          officer doing a 168 mph on the Massachusetts Turnpike in a 
          Ferrari 512 Boxer (not my car, belonged to a friend who was with 
          me, geezzzz, talk about no need for a stereo!).  It was 3:30 am 
          and the only way he caught up with me was at a toll booth.  After 
          finding out the car wasn't stolen, that I was sober, and after a 
          severe tongue lashing about how this was grounds for jail time, 
          and, of course, several minutes of apologizing profusely, he let 
          me off with a warning!  Needless to say, I donated $$$ to the 
          annual police fundraiser.......
          My second experience was in Maryland a couple of years later.  I 
          was clocked doing 71 mph in a 55 at 2:30 am.  This time I was 
          slapped with "reckless driving".  I was the only one on the 
          highway, no weaving, sober, etc, etc.  Why reckless driving?  He 
          wouldn't tell me.  I guess it had to do with the $50 for speeding 
          vs. $255 for reckless driving, and probably a slow night.  Go 
          figure?

Subject: Re: Color Sanding


Bev-

You never quite said what was wrong with the "couple of areas 
on the hood," making it hard to give definitive advice.  I'm 
assuming they are slightly off color due to oxidation, or slightly 
rough due to dust, or something like that.  Here's what I'd do.

I'd start with the 1500 grit and the rubber pad.  Soak the paper 
in water for a few minutes before using it, and add a little 
detergent to the water.  The detergent helps keep bits of sanded 
off paint out of the sandpaper.  The 2000 grit is too fine to do 
anything, and the 600 grit may be unnecessarily coarse.  If the 
1500 doesn't get you anywhere in a reasonabl;e time, go back to 
the 600, and follow that with the 1500.  Keep it wet too.  (Use 
separate containers for soaking the different grits, or clean 
thoroughly between uses.  You don't want 600 grit particles in 
your 1500 grit paper.)  Keep the surface nice and wet.  Don't 
scrimp on water.  You can keep the pressure even enough with 
your hand.  It should only take a few minutes to sand off the 
top surface.  Check it by drying it with a towel.  When it's 'done' 
it will look dullish.

When you have that nice, even, dull sheen, it's time to use 
polishing compound.  I'm afraid that guys might jump all over 
me for this one, but you don't have to go through all the hoopla 
about wool pads, or sheepskin pads, or this polish or that 
polish, if you're just doing a bit of patching up.  Just use a nice 
clean cotton rag.  Believe it or not, you can even get by with a 
paper towel, but don't tell anyone I told you that.  Any good 
polish will do.  The 3M Finesse is fine, PPG makes stuff called 
DRX-10, I think, and I'm sure one of the Meguiars polishes will 
work as well too, although I haven't used them myself.  I tend 
to stick with the 'professional' products, like 3M and PPG.  I 
figure that they have to satisfy folks who make a living 
polishing cars, not just some hobbyists.  

Don't use a power polisher.  You don't need it for a small 
section (and you can actually screw things up with it if you're 
not experienced).  You also don't have to worry about using 
coarse polish, then a finer polish, and so on.  You do that if 
you're doing a whole car.  It saves time.  But if you're just doing 
a spot here and there, you can use fine polish to begin with and 
just rub a little longer.  It'll take ten minutes instead of five.  

There's not a whole lot of magic to it, and not a whole lot to 
worry about.  It's hard to ruin a finish by polishing it!

I noticed that the 911 Carrera increased HP from 207 to 217 (202 to 214 depending
on the source) from the 84-86 to 87-89 model years. The specs list both 3.2l engines
with the same compression ratio and the same fuel injection system (DME). Was the 
incease in HP due to differences in the DME or was the valves/head design modified?
If if was due to the DME was it simply a software change or something more 
significant? Can the earlier Carreras (84-86) DME be upgraded to this level of
performance without major expense?

A change was made in '87 to the DME program (i.e. chip) to assume Super
Unleaded was being used instead of regular unleaded. This assumption
allowed them to get the extra 10 hp....

Tracy,

No, no knock sensors until '89 with the 3.6 and it's 11.3:1 compression
ratio. Of course, the twin-plugs makes it more like 10.3:1, but that is
still awful high.

The Haynes manual has a marginal description

After removing the bolt at the bottom of the strut,
is it necessary to get a ball joint fork and pound it
to separate the strut from the joint, or is there an 
easier/better way? 

Secondly:
What do people use to hold the  the top of the strut rod

That's one of the things I love about my Shelby Charger (turbo, of course). I 
paid about $2000 for it and could outperform (acceleration AND handling) 
the majority of other cars on the road, easily. I recall reading somewhere 
that one of the goal of Carroll Shelby's Charger was to outperform the 944 
at 1/3 (or less) of the cost. :)

But, then I bought the 914, and eventually the turbo died, and now I 
tearfully have to sell the Shelby... :(

Hopefully, next winter I'll get to do some motor work and get the 914 up to 
at least close to the acceleration power of the Charger... I miss power! :)

It is very obvious when your O2 sensor fails (or the connector cracks in half as
happened to me), your gas mileage will get unbelievably bad.  

While I was away under the ocean working for Uncle Sam on a Submarine my wife
took the 944 in for it's Smog check, naturally they sold her a new O2 sensor.
When I started driving the car again I noticed that the range was down to about
150 miles per tank, something like 10 to 12 miles per gallon.  There were no
other symptoms of abnormal operation.  

Once I replaced the connector on the firewall everything returned to normal.

That's right... these are off a 1986 944 Turbo. A very rare Phone dial.

They are perfect for autocross or club racing wheels.

(this was stock on the 1986 turbo)

I am about to send them to woods for refinishing if no 
one wants them for autocrossing. After they come back from woods I am

These came off of a 1986 944 Turbo that just got a nice treat from its

Jim:

This is a very good price, or at least it would be in the Chicago area. I
took delivery tonight of a factory ordered 993 C4 Cabriolet; they had given
me 5% off the sticker. This is from a dealership that, between myself and my
partners, we've purchased approximately a dozen cars. I had taken their deal
to a rival Porsche dealer, where I had purchased a different vehicle and thus
was a customer there, also. They would only give me approximately 2 - 3% off
the sticker, even knowing what the rival dealership would do.

8% off seems good to me. Demand is still high on these cars.

Greetings:

This is in response to Pat Moyle's letter of 95-02-22. His blasting of
Autopower cages is based on mis-information, mis-communication, and
mis-understanding. There are several false statements that libel Autopower
and all Autopower dealers such as myself.

First, Pat Moyle is WRONG in claiming that an Autopower cage was involved in
the accident at the 1993 runoffs. THIS IS FALSE! The cage that failed was
made by another manufacturer. The name of the manufacturer is not pertenant,
I will supply this information to anyone who really cares. Call me at the 800
number below.

Second, in racing, there will always be accidents that far exceed the design
limitations of the safety equipment of the car. Third, Autopower DOES make a
cage for the 914 that mounts to the door sills using welded mounting plates
with nuts on the back side. Forth, any Autopower cage may be custom
fabricated to mount to welding plates attached to the door sills.

It is the responsibility of the race car owner to determine what is the
safest and most cost-effective choice. Although Race-Tech, Mattar and Safety
Devices all make cages that will hold up to most accidents, I will bet that
their failure rate per cages-made is no better or worse than anyone elses.

In the specific accident at the 1993 runoffs that was referred to, the car
hit head-on into a tire barrier at excessive speed and was flipped
approximately 10 feet in the air before crashing down on the roof of the car
with tremendous force. Many things happened to cause the driver to be hurt in
that accident, only one of which was that the cage punched through the floor
of the car. AGAIN, THE CAGE INVOLVED WAS NOT MADE BY AUTOPOWER. It is not
certain that a cage using welded in mounting plates would not have failed
also. SCCA has since reviewed their rules and made changes to roll cage
tubing diameters and allowed aftermarket seats in Showroom Stock cars.
However, Showroom Stock cars must still use bolt-in roll cages.

Bottom line...Pat Moyle was right in one thought...don't scrimp on your
personal safety. I don't know Mr. Moyle, but "Judge not lest ye be judged";
but if you are going to judge, at least get your facts right.

Tens of thousands of Autopower cages have been installed in race cars over
the years. Autopower would not still be in business if there were truly a
safety problem.

Subject: 912 Carburetor Questions

To: Porschephiles
From: MAESTRO132@aol.com
Subject: Weber/Solex/Zenith Carbs on a 356/912

        Recently, there has been a discussion here concerning the use of
Weber Carburetors vs. Solex/Zenith carbs on a 356 or 912 Porsche.
        Having personally installed & adjusted HUNDREDS of carburetors
of all the above types on 356/912's, I think you might like to hear the
results.
        Result 1: IF Zenith or Solex Carbs have been rebuilt properly-
with all surfaces machined flat, the bodies ultrasonically cleaned and
in the case of Solexes, bronze throttle shafts bushings installed
(along with oversize butterflies, if needed), then they work well!
        Result 2: The 40 IDF Webers (and even the 44IDF Webers),
work well on 356's or 912 too! Don't let others steer you toward a wrong
decision with their personal prejudices and half-truths. A good carburetor 
is a good carburetor, and Webers are good carburetors.
        It's more a matter of personal choice- like do you want to be 
Original, or do you want Ball Bearings supporting your throttle shaft?
   As far as Weber carburetors, I like both the 40 and 44IDF- which one you
select depends on the application. The 40's are a good choice for a 
street engine, they're more tractable around town and give better gas
mileage. 
     The 44's produce more high-end power (at the cost of low-end
driveability)
and give you the sound of the Ferrari at less than 1% of the cost.
     The 40's, having a 40mm bore are best used with the Solex manifold and
the Adapto-plate. (This also eliminates interference with the sheet metal
and spring plate bolts on late-model fan shrouds.) The 44's, having a 44mm
bore, should be used with the Weber manifold as it too has a 44mm bore and
things then match. The Weber manifold, however, requires some trimming of
the
Side Vertical shrouds to provide clearance. (Also, if you use the Weber
manifold on late-model Fan Shrouds, then you should watch out for
interference
between bolts holding the Spring Plate on the Fan Shroud and the
screws holding the block-off plate on the Weber.)
     The biggest problem with Solexes is that the steel throttle shaft wears
its bore in the carburetor body (there being no bushings in the
early Solexes). Eventually, the wear gets so bad that the butterflies
start digging into the throttle body, opening up gaps around the butterfly,
allowing more air than necessary to pass through. This causes the high RPM
idle condition characteristic of worn Solexes. Adjusting the mixture screws
either has little or no effect or makes things worse. It's time to rebuild
the Solexes, which to do properly, costs almost as much as a set of NEW
Webers!
     Webers don't NEED the throttle shaft bore rebored or rebushed
since Webers have ball bearings supporting the throttle shaft and do not
suffer from throttle shaft wear like the Solexes do. THAT'S a big advantage.
     With Solexes, changing a main jet means that the entire 
contents of the float bowl pouand it's a joy to adjust the idle mixture
screws- they're
like micrometers and repeatable. A sign of a good carburetor.)
      Just my $.02.

 secothe float chamber flowing all over
your spark plug wires.
       Having the Main Jet, Air Correction Jet and Emulsion Tube
on a single, easily-removed Jet Stack is a Better Idea.
      The big disadvantage of Webers is that they are not Original. If you
want only original parts on your car, you're stuck with Solexes or Zeniths.
      Speaking of Zeniths- though not a "performance" carburetor, when 
properly rebuilt they run Very Well, thank you. (I just fired up a rebuilt
356C today- and it's a joy to adjust the idle mixture  screws- they're
like micrometers and repeatable. A sign of a good carburetor.)

Jim, 8% is certainly not bad, and the dealer is probably relying on a sale
from existing inventory (thus the "no factory delivery available").  However,
a local friend obtained 10% a few weeks ago on a new cab (his choice of color
and options, and quick delivery), so you might want to look around a little

Subject: RE: Looking For 944 Turbo ?

Darren,

Hope this helps.

The latest model 944 Turbo (951), would be a 944 Turbo S 1989. This was the
only 944 turbo model available in the U.S for 1989. This model was also
produced in 1988 as a limited edition in a special color, silver rose metallic
with matching plaid interior. Aprox. 700 car were shipped to PCNA. As demand
exceeded supply, along with complaints about the color, other colors were 
produced. 

The 944 turbo was first introduced in this country as an '86 model. The early
VIN #'s had some problems.(exhaust manifolds cracking, fuel line coupling
leaking, a change in the exhaust system in '87 I think, a change in the
crossover pipe, which takes off 5 hours of labor when changing the clutch.)

In '87, ABS brakes and dual air bags were offered as options. There were
changes to the front wheel geometry to accomadate the ABS, wheel offset
changed. Also remember the problems were addressed and the updates were fitted
in this model year, not that this car didn't have it's problems (waterpumps,
etc.) A self adjusting belt tensioner was also added.

In 1988 a special edition model was produced as a direct result from
the Porsche turbo cup. The new model came equipped with 928 S4 brakes
a engine with 247 bhp, new vanes in turbocharger and DME remapping. Minor 
changes were made to the fender area to accomadate the larger tires and 
wheels. Sport suspension (M 030), stronger manual transmission and LSD, clutch
modifications, along with other changes. This car was loaded with all options.

In 1988 the standard turbo was also available. In 1989 this special
edition model was the only turbo available. Of course it came in all
color combinations and options included.

Be aware that these Turbo S cars produce almost 65 hp per cylinder! These
cars exibit more problems, because of the higher performance. Also people in 
general run these cars harder. If you plan to purchase one of these expect 
higher repair bills. I feel that this is the best 944, but there are trade 
offs. The 1988 non S is a great buy, alot of bugs were worked out buy this 
time. Of course these S models will demand the higest price of the Turbo's, 
get a pre inspectionby someone who "knows" these cars, it will be well worth 
it.
Good luck, I hope this helps a bit.

I looked at a lot of lifts. I was not able to get one as the Ceiling in 
my garage is to low. The lift would fit but could not get the 914 high 
enought to park to 911 under it. Call the manufactures and get there 
brochures that include the installation measurements. Then you will have 
a better idea if you can fit it in the garage.

I personally like the lifts where you put the car on the ramps and it is 
open in the middle great for engine drop oil change etc.

Be prepare to spend about $3,000 for a good one.

Oh thank you morally correct people who have shown me the light.  I will never 
road race again, definitly wear a seat belt, and always wear a condom.
	
	Come on people, why did you buy a Porsche? don't give me this BS that 
it's the fine German Engineering because Volkswagen/Audis, BMW's and Mercedes 
are engineered just as well.  I also don't believe that most of the Porsches 
sold are sold because of the (yes I will say it) sex-appeal of the driver - be 
that male or female.

	These cars are pure-breds built for safe fast (& lets not forget FUN) 
performance motoring, and unless you have NEVER broken the speed limit don't 
give me a hard time about a previous experience.  After all I was there to 
evaluate road conditions, visibility of other vehicles etc.etc.  By the way if 
someone has an autox organized in the Ohio area then please challenge me, this 
944 is bringing back all sorts of pleasant memories of when I used to race 
karts!

	I also realize that the 944 is never going to be a dragster, otherwise 
I would have bought an AC Cobra.  In the meantime the bike will suffice...

	However there still remains the quest for more performance from the 
vehicle at hand.  Even though it already is a fearful autox tool, it could 
undoubtedly be better.  THAT's why I asked about 'bang for the buck' and 
details about my hypertech chip.  I have no details for this chip, but was 
told by a friend that these chips are sold with some other components (much 
like a kit) to upgrade performance.  Is this correct?  I have also heard of a 
high flow catalytic convertor sold by the dreaded JC Whitney but which 
supposedly increases exhaust flow.  I have already purchased the K&N air-
filter which made a satisfying difference over the partly-clogged standard 
filter.  Any other cheap mods available?  Is a change to a Dinan or 
Autothority chip worthwhile?

Subject: Re: Subject: Roll Cages


Hi Ken,

I think I read Pat's posting a little differently than you, and took a
different message away.  To my thinking, the issue at hand is not
Autopower vs. other manufacturers.  The issue is cages (and for
that matter roll bars) which mount to a floor pan vs. those which
mount to structurally stronger points, like the frame rails.

In this matter, no one has convinced me that mounting a cage to
a floor pan is as safe as mounting it to frame rails.  I probably should
look at the Run-Offs incident as a single data point, and I am not
a mechanical engineer.  But it seems pretty clear to me that, to
create the best survival cell for the driver, it ought to be connected
at all eight corners of the cube.

You say "Forth, any Autopower cage may be custom
fabricated to mount to welding plates attached to the door sills."
This is certainly true on the surface.  But for an equipment vendor
to market an a priori inferior or inadequate design, with the "out"
that its buyer is free to correct that design, is absurd.  I can
think of a lot of analogies, but the nearest to hand is a new car
warranty.  How would you feel if, after buying a new car and a
defect arose, the dealer's response was "Hey no problem,
feel free to fix it on you own nickel, Ken"?

I have seen AutoPower cages modified to mount to the frames,
for example, in a friend's 930.  That involved a bunch of work
on the part of the guy who installed it.  Too bad those front legs
weren't shaped properly in the first place.

Moreover, you presume that the buyer or his mechanic a) recognizes
the problem, and b) knows how to properly fix it.  Go to any PCA
Club Race or track event, and I can walk you around the paddock
and point out any number of counterexamples.  I have been told
that the same can be said for SCCA and IMSA.

You also say "It is the responsibility of the race car owner to determine
 what is the safest and most cost-effective choice."  Unfortunately,
most of the owners are pretty good at the latter and kind of lost
when dealing with the former.  Most folks assume that AutoPower, Race
Tec, and the rest have done their homework and produced a safe,
high quality part which will install in a car correctly.  This certainly
should be the case, but it isn't always.

Your points about SCCA's changes to cage material thickness and
their rules regaring bolt-in (vs welded in) parts don't seem to have
any bearing on the matter of floor mounts and the Run Offs incident.

Finally, you say "Tens of thousands of Autopower cages have been
installed in race cars over the years. Autopower would not still be
in business if there were truly a safety problem."  Unfortunately, as
Hunter and Stoff point out in their book "Motorsports Medicine", it
is damn hard to get any statistics on injury rates and component
failure rates from manufacturers and racing organizations.  There
is no organization which certifies, eg, Autopower's equipment and
decides whether they may sell it or not.  Your statement could just
as easily have been made of any number of product, technologies,
and companies which no longer exist.  There are hundreds of millions
of people who smoke cigarettes, after all.

Subject: Re: Performance tips 2

OK, Jan,

Since you insist on knowing whether or not reprogrammed chips will help the
performance of your car, I will relate my experience.

I came across a free copy of the Autothority chip for my 83 944. (Don't ask, 
it was just one of the side-benefits of being in the business...) I installed
it, drove it on the street for a month or so, drove it at Lime Rock a couple
of days in driver education.

Bottom line:

1) Most noticeable difference: Rev limiter kicked in at @ 7000 rpm vice 6500.

2) Difference in power: my assessment: slight increase in torque from 1000 
   rpm to 2000 rpm (10 lb-ft??). My guess at increased horsepower was 5 bhp.
   
3) Difference in lap times at Lime Rock: none

4) Other observations: My wife observed, as passenger, "The car sounds funny.
   What did you do to it?" After she pointed it out to me, I did become aware
   of a different pitch to the sound of the motor. I attributed it to the
   timing being advanced to a point much closer to detonation that normal.

Final disposition:

A track junkie friend said he really wanted the chip, so I sold it to him.
Never missed it.

My advice to you: Don't buy a chip (no matter what brand) unless you first 
get a written assurance from the seller that you can have your money back in 
full within a reasonable timeframe (say 30 days).

And, of course, if you haven't learned to drive your car at the limit, by
way of driver education, don't waste the money in the first place.

In my opinion, the $500 spent on a chip is better spent on some good BFG Comp
TA R1 tires (which is exactly what I did with the money from my track junkie 
friend.)  :-)

Of course, Your mileage may vary...

Subject: 951/stuffing tires in front

Need some input from the group.
Having  run 275 x 17 tires under the rear of my Turbo/S I am flushed with
success. My experience at Sebring shows that 275's are a non interference fit
on the rear of my car. The question now is whether or not I can run 255 x
17's on the front. BFG just came out with 245's in the 17 inch size so those
are an option since I am now running 245 x 16's in the front presently. 
Any one have an experience running 255's on the front of a STOCK 944 Turbo?

Subject: 944TurboS brake proportioning

I have heard it is possible to change the brake proportioning on
my 89 944TurboS in order to let the rear do more work. Supposedly
there is a sleve above the ABS computer (wherever that is) that if
replaced  by one from a (things get fuzzy here) 928 or 968 then it
will proportion more to the rear. Does anyone know the facts on this?

BTW I am NOT interested in a discussion about the merits of doing this 
just the technical facts. Thanks...

What is an 83 SC engine w/ tranny worth?  It is in storage, but the owner says
that the engine had a broken head stud when he took it out of the car.
The CIS is included.  Is this a no lose situation if the price is around
$2k?  The number on the case should be 930_____3.0 correct? What else
should I check for?  I guess the only way to tell the shape with it not
being in the car would be a leakdown huh?  Any other advice is appreciated.

Todd...Relax.  Many first timers make a much bigger deal of this than it is.
It would seem that you have taken the trouble to make sure that you have a
very safe car, and that is probably the most important thing.  As a rookie,
you will get class training, and have an instructor with you for most of the
weekend.  They will be able to ansewr most of your questions.  As far as more
mods to the car, you do not need it.  You will NOT be going all that fast at
your first event, and as you come out to these, you will naturally drive
harder, and learn what is needed to keep your car working "properly" and
safely.  Finally, you should arrive at the track at 7 am, and you will have
at least 1 1/2 hours to clean out and prep your car.  Hope that helps.

Subject: Roll Cages

Greetings:

Evidently in stating the roll cage involved in the 1993 runoffs incident was
an Autopower product, I was in error.  If this is  in fact true, I apologize
to the list for this misinformation.  

I did not, however state that the cage failed.  What I said was, "keep in
mind the cage itself did not fail, the mounting system was inadequate and the
roll over protection system failed."

My intent was not to blast Autopower, but was meant as a discussion on mass
produced roll cages in general and the merits (or defeciencies) of the
designs available.  The fact that the runoffs cage was not an Autopower does
not erase the fact that the cage in question, which was bolted to the
floorboard of the car, in your words, "punched through the floor of the car,"
This, if nothing else illustrates the very point I was trying to make.

I spent the day mentally composing what I thought would be a thoughtful
response to Mr. Myers post of this morning.  When I got home this evening, I
found Kevin Gross had already composed and posted it for me.  Thanks Kevin, I
couldn't have said it nearly as well myself.

Bottom line for me is, I will never have a cage in MY car which bolts to the
floorboard, regardless of who makes it.

Don,
I am investigating that very problem as we speak. It is apparent that the
rear brakes are along for the ride. Consider that I, and probably you, wear
out 3 or 4 front brakes for every set of rears. This is in racing situations,
I can't speak for the street.
When I was at the Club Race at Sebring I talked to from the guys at
Kelly-Moss racing and they told me that the proportioning valve could be
changed so the rears take some of the burden from the fronts. They also said
that they could supply the part but first they wanted to know the numbers
that were written on my old part. Apparently there is a ratio written on the
valve body. I have not done this as of today but it will happen in the
future.(the Kelly-Moss people claim that they use brakes in a 2:1 ration and
their cars are really good under braking)
I do have some concerns with this because of the ABS system. I need to know
how this will be effected by the changes, etc, etc, so I'm not going to
plunge into this lightly.
BTW the proportioning valve is in back of the right front plastic fender
inner liner. Pull off the wheel, unbolt the plastic liner and you will see
the proportioning valve sitting on top of the ABS pump. It is a cylindrical
device that is in line with the pump and the rear brake line.
Let me know how you make out.

Jerry

Mike,

I would think you should see alot more than 13mpg.  My '76 gets
low-to-mid 20s in the mpg department (same injection system
as yours, slightly smaller engine at 2.7L) no matter how I drive
it.  You don't mention any running problems, but I would guess that
your mileage indicates something is amiss?

Sean,

First off, the engine type (which can be found down near the bottom
of the fan housing on the passenger's side) should be 930/16 for a
US car, 930/10 for an '83 R.o.W. car.  $2k isn't too bad.  A friend of
mine offered to sell me his 3.0L engine (sans gearbox) for $2.5k and
it has ZERO compression in one cylinder and the others are averaging
about 50 psi - I passed.

Unfortunately, the broken head stud is a given.  Not a real big deal, but
it is expensive to get fixed (if for no other reason than the fact that
once your in there, you might as well do other stuff too - I wouldn't
tear the whole engine down and just replace the one stud).

My opinion?  If you're planning on buying this for your own use, it might
be worth considering.  If you plan on buying it with the intent of re-selling
it for a profit, you might want to evaluate how many $$$ *might* have to
be put into it prior to resale.

HTH,

Mike

Thanks for the info, what I need to find out is what the part # is

Yes, I replaced the proportioning valve on my 89-951.  The stock
valve is an "5/18" and I used a "5/33". I think the number 5
refers to the rate of the reduction in pressure to the rear
brakes, and the 18 or 33 refers to the pressure, in bar, of the
point where the valve starts to modulate the rear brake pressure.
Hence the 33 would allow up to 33 bar of pressure to the rear
brakes before reducing the hydraulic pressure.  (List, please
correct me if I am wrong here). Check the service manual to
confirm this.  The installation is simple - remove the RF fender
liner, remove the brake line, remove the old valve (about the
size of a "C" battery)...installation is the reverse of
disassembly.  Bleed the brakes and go.  The valve is about $70 -
and not much to it.  You could change the spring in your valve if
you knew what spring to use.  E-mail if you want the part number.

Results:

I don't have enough track time with this setup to give a
quantitative answer.  The fronts will still (attempt to) lock
before the rears.  I feel that there is a bit less nose dive with
this setup.  The rear brakes are doing more work than stock.  My
rear brake pads (Blue Cool Carbon) have worn a bit more than
before - maybe 25% over 3 track events (200 mi avg/event). Two
other 89's in the club have done this modification and are happy.
One car, an '86 951, had a lot of rear lockup and re-installed
the original valve.

>  BTW I am NOT interested in a discussion about the merits of doing
>  this just the technical facts. Thanks...

Disclaimer:
The service manual says that you must retain the stock valve.
No reason is given.  I assume it is because of potential rear
brake lockup.

Yes, I agree Joe!  The volume on pfiles is so high I may have to stop 
reading it.  Two friends just did exactly that.  Too much non-Porsche 
or "me too" traffic.  I'd like to see Porsche technical, service, 
driving, etc. tips, but not broadcasts of random stories whose threads 
continue on for 2 weeks.

Hey everyone, let's keep the topics focused on the primary mission of pfiles.

Subject: Is a 2.4 liter 911 engine with 2.7 pistons okay?

I test drove a 1973 911E yesterday and it had *EXPLOSIVE* acceleration.
When I asked the guy about this, he said that it had the pistons from
a 2.7 liter on the original 2.4 liter crankcase.  I've been steering
away from 2.7 because of the reliability problems; am I going to have
the same problem with this amalgamation?  Also, does this modification
cause problems for California smog?

Thanks!  Hopefully, I've finally found my 911.

Subject: 911 Pre-Purchase Sanity Check

HELP!

I've fallen in love with a car, and need somebody to either talk me out of
it, or tell me to GO FOR IT!

Here's the details:
1983 SC Coupe
Platinum Metallic 
93,000 Miles
Brown Leather Interior
Cellular Phone/ CD Player
16" Fuchs
All original (as far as I can tell)
2nd owner, all records since new.

The car is extremely clean.  I have looked at cars with similar claims but
they've always turned out to be full of chips, dings and scratches.  This car
has maybe 5 chips on the hood and that's it!  The interior looks brand new,
there aren't even wear marks on the carpet!  And the door pockets aren't
broken (for once!), Engine looks good, but I don't know about whether it's
had the Carrera tensioner update, or if it has a rubber-centered clutch.  I
will be scheduling a pre-purchase inspection with a mechanic tomorrow.

The guy wants $19,000 firm.  That seems a little high for that year.  Prices
typically seem to be 11,775 on the low end to 18,500 on the high end for n
'83 coupe.  But the car is beautiful!  I haven't even driven it yet because
it's been raining.

Any advice from those who have been through this recently is appreciated.

Will be glad to let you know when we have some answers. In the meantime you
certainly DON'T want cool carbons on the rear as they are much harder then
factory pads. Try the cool carbons on the front and soft (factory) pads on
the rear. That should help your situation somewhat. 
BTW does your car have ABS? If it does not be real careful with the bias.
What you (and the factory) don't want is the rears locking up first, in which
case you will have the joy of watching the rear of the car pass the front!

Subject: RE: brake proportioning valve

Hi Mike, Jerry, Rubin, + all,

I wanted to finish the discussion and raise a question regarding
the brake proportioning valve.  Mike was on the right track.  The
numbers on these valves appearing on 944S's, Turbo's and,
presumably S2's, refer to a reduction rate and bar pressure
respectively.  S's have a 5/33, Turbo's a 5/18.  The first number
means the rate at which all marginal increases in pedal pressure
above a cetain bar, 18/33 in this case, are reduced by during
their trip to the rear.  This number 5 refers to a factor of .46
(factory manual in hand).  Stated another way, when you brake hard
enough to activate this regulator, you start getting more front
brake bias.

In my 944S I definitly experience this.  I've gone through more
than three sets of front pads for 3.5mm of rear pad wear.  I've 
tried cross-sanding the rotors with emory cloth and lightly 
sanding the pads in hopes of bringing them back to life.  The
fluid is regularly bled.  But to no avail.  I can go down a sandy,
steep, hill hit the brakes and still lock only the fronts.

My question is whether, upon experiencing this, any list member
has gone the route of installing a bias adjustor and removing the
regulator on their 944.  Comments from those mixing pads would 
also be appreciated.

Subject: Mounting A Tire w/out Marking Wheel - Update

A week or so ago I asked folks on the net about how to have a tire mounted
on an aluminum wheel without leaving any "little dimple marks" on the
inside of the wheel...

To make a long story short(er), I went down to Dinan (the BMW tuning place)
in Mtn. View, CA and had a talk with them.  They showed me their machine -
pretty typical euro-car garage tire mounting machine.  These machine have
four hydraulicaly-operated wheel "gripper jaws" which move radially outward
to grip the (aluminum) wheel from the inside and hold it tight when the
tire's mounted. These "tables" are a lot like a lathe's 4-jaw chuck, but
the whole thing faces upwards instead of sideways.

Using these gripper jaws one cannot avoid the little dimples that are left
on the wheel.  BUT the jaws are double-acting -- they can also grip the
wheel from the outside, i.e. over the rim / inner bead, and they act upon
the "back side" of the bead, not on the rim itself.  These "outside-grip"
jaws don't have teeth, and they're radiused to approximate the curvature of
some particular wheel size, so the net effect is that it's somewhat more
likely that they may slip when the tire's being mounted.  Also, these jaws
have to be retracted (outwards) once the operator is ready to inflate the
tire and set it on the bead.  

Anyway, I said I wanted the tire mounted using this non-standard method,
and they felt they could do it (the service manager said he's put his "best
man on it"), and the net result is that it worked out fine -- the only
marks, if there are any, are now hidden by the tire. Plus, they did it for
free.

I presume the reason why many shops do it leaving the dimples is that it's
faster and it's less likely to slip since the jaws are actually digging
into the wheel.

My thanks to those of you who replied to my initial query.

And I was wondering if anyone out there had suggestions regarding options

. The goal of the upgrade is to create a full time autocrosser in the
future. I would like to get some opinions on rotors. Are slotted/drilled
rotors even worth while? Should I stick with stock? What kind of pads do
you recomend? I'm planning on upgrading to the 19mm master cylinder at the

Subject: Repairing Porsche Wheels

Pierre Vezina has a problem with a cloudy finish on his phone dial wheels.
 "The wheels show whitish dicoloration....and small streaks on the wheel".  

This problem is not unusual and may be the result of several factors. The
most common cause is your friendly local car wash.  Many automated car washes
use an acid to clean the wheels and tires.  This acid cleaner will rapidly
remove dirt, but may also attack the clear coat on Porsche wheels.  The
result is a cloudy, whitish or dull appearance.  

Many times, this may be cleared up by using a paint glaze such as 3M Hand
Glaze or Meguiar #09 or One Grand Omega Glaze to clean the affected paint.
 The OEM finish on many Porsche wheels is simply a silver paint with a clear
top coat.  This combination is not too different from the paint on the body.

Clean the wheel throughly with a quality wheel cleaner and dry completely.
Apply your choice of glaze to a soft cloth and rub out the clouding.  If this
does not do the trick, put a generous amount of 3M on your cloth and add a
small amount (about the size of your pinkie nail) of Blue Magic Metal Polish.
  Rub out the clouding with this combination.  The Blue Magic /3M combination
will usually get the job done.  If it has, follow up with a coat of quality
wax.  I use Sonax Spray Hard Wax on the wheels.  It doesn't chalk and
requires only light buffing.

Some painted/clear coated wheels will "yellow" under hard use applications.
 This is fairly common with track wheels that are subject to hard braking.
 The tremendous heat generated affects the clear coat and causes it to turn
yellow.  The 3M/Blue Magic trick will help to some degree, but not usually
restore them to original appearance.  

If the finish has not improved at this point, you may consider using a more
abrassive cleaner such as Meguiar #02 Fine Cut Cleaner or Meguiar #01 Medium
Cut Cleaner.  Apply either one to a soft cloth and *GENTLY* rub into the
wheel. Use carefully as you may put hairline scratches if you rub too hard.
 When the desired finish has been achieved, follow up with 3M Hand Glaze to
"finish out" the surface and then wax.   
 
A wheel that has resisted all of the above, may require repainting.  If the
existing paint is in good condition, other than discolored, slighly rough up
the paint with a 1200 grit sandpaper.  Wash thoroughly with a Prepsol type
product to remove all grease.  Spray the wheel with a quality primer such as
Wurth Rustop Primer and several *LIGHT* coats of Wurth Gloss Silver Wheel
Paint, allowing each coat to dry for two hours, prior to the next coat.
 Allow to dry for a few days, clean thoroughly and spray several *LIGHT*
coats of Wurth Gloss Clear Wheel Paint.  The Wurth products match the OEM
finish.  The Wurth Gloss Gold Wheel Paint matches the BBS gold finish.

If the surface of the wheel is pitted, or the paint has flaked off in
patches, all paint should be removed prior to repainting,  The easiest and in
my opinion, the only way,  is to have them blasted with a plastic media.
 Most blasting shops have the plastic media, but don't like to use it because
it is relatively slow (time=$).  Some people use glass bead.   Other blasting
media will dimple the wheels. Aluminum oxide leaves a distinct texture to the
surface.  Once all the old paint has been removed, clean the wheel with
Prepsol, prime and then paint.

One of the keys to maintaining your wheels is a coat of wax.  The wax acts as
a sacrificial protectant.  The damaging effects of red hot brake dust,  brake
dust acids, pollution and ozone are unleashed upon the wax and not your
wheel.

If there are any questions, or areas that need amplification, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Subject:  2.4 engine for a 914?

Hello,

I might have a chance to get my hands on a 2.4 liter engine from a '73 911T.
This engine would be installed in my 914 in place of the tired 1.8L currently
pushing it around.  The engine is supposed to have the original injection system
and is supposed to have updated chain tensioners.  I have a couple questions
to ask the 911 folks:

Is the '73 2.4 "T" mechanically injected or does it use the CIS?
Any problem areas to be aware of with this engine?
What is a typical life expectancy of this engine?

I think this engine is already out of the car.  Are there any tests I can do at this
point to determine the general health of the engine before buying it?  About all I
can think of might be to hook a battery up to the starter and perform a
compression test.  Is this safe to do on an engine not bolted down?  Come to
think of it, it probably won't even have oil in it.  Nevermind.  Other ideas?

Thanks for any advice,

Dan:

Good points.  However, frequent rinsing of the sponge (or using two 
sponges, as suggested in an earlier post) will keep the dirt-transfer to 
a minimum.

I only wash from the bottom up so that I don't miss any parts of the 
car. When I start at the top, the soap runs down and I can't 
differentiate between the areas that have actually been touched by the 
sponge and those that are just soapy.

If you, like most people, have a better memory than I do, this won't be 
a problem.

Mike,

You are correct in your description of the numbers on the brake
proportioning valve.  The "5" corresponds to a 0.46 drop in
marginal pressure.

The 5/18 valve used on the 944 Turbo is in fact superseded by
Porsche to the 5/33 valve first used on the 944S.  There have
been multiple supersessions in getting there, but the correct
current part is 928.355.305.02, list price $69.05 (at least it was in
August).

    I have heard that you could get good results by upgrading to 911

the 911 stuff and you want to go junkyarding, I believe the 911 front

Subject: 924 cooling failiure and subsequent cracking of top

Gentlemen,

I am new to this list so please correct me if this entry is too untechnical
or otherwise inappropriate, but I believe the following experience may be
of interest to at least owners of older 924s.  Also, I apologize for my
imprecise technical English - this is a foreign language to me.


I drive a 1982 924 which has a quiet life in a garage most of the year, it
was bought with a cracked top (block is steel, top is aluminium) which was
replaced.

Unfortuantely, I never changed the original 12-year old cooling water
rubber tubes, and one of these burst open after driving the car at top
speed for about 40 minutes (this was in a European country with liberal
policies on traffic).

The symptoms arose over about two-three minutes:
The engine lost a little power, and the speed dropped from about 210 to 190
km/h while full pedal-to-metal (by speed indicator, more or less accurate),
I lost oil pressure, going from a healthy 3-4 to about 2-1 1/2 bars, and
the engine temp indicator dropped and then started fluctuating wildly.  The
smell of oil, obviously boiling in the engine, appeared, and I pulled over
at a petrol station about 20 secs after the smell of oil appeared.

Too late.

After the steam subsided, I found the burst tube (a sort of L-shaped with
different diametres in entry and exit, right side of engine when viewed
from front).

I improvised a repairing of the tube, refilled water in the cooling
curcuit, and tried to get the engine started, but it cranked very slowly,
as if the battery was flat.  By towing it and cranking the engine, we got
it started.  It was running unevenly and would not idle without stopping.

We towed it home and it would not start again.

This turned out to be hydrostatic locking: cooling water in one or more
cylindres due to burst top gasket.  This was apparent as it was towed
upwards onto a tow truck and water was seeping out of the exhaust pipe.  A
sorry sight in deed.

Epilogue:  The top turned out cracked (2nd time!) and it has now been replac=
ed.

Advice: Replace cooling curcuit components even when they still function.
I have heard elsewhere that the cooling of the otherwise reliable
Volkswagen LT engine is a weak point.

The old rule about not fixing something that works soes not apply in this ca=
se.

Subject: 914 muffler (primary?) replacement question

  Lost quite a bit of my primary muffler's "muffling" ability yesterday...
  haven't had a chance to crawl under and confirm, but I believe it's just
  the primary and not secondary ('75 914 2.0).  So, should I just look to
  replace that (have a coupla' catalogs open), or while I'm at it, replace
  the whole thing?  If so, it looks like I can get a Bursch (complete) for
  less $$ than just ordering a primary (or secondary)...  main concern is
  getting most "bang for the buck " (i.e., value).  All suggestions
  welcome, and thanks again for everyone's help.

  is setting off car alarms, but is hoping it doesn't last TOO long...

I would not have said 2.7 for reliability as much as the E and S of 
72-73. The compression of the E and S (using the otherwise same engine 
as T) is quite a bit higher than a T... Supposedly this causes certain

Subject: More 944 quirks

Well since I went for a long(er) drive this weekend in my new rebuilt puppy, I 
thought I'd tried out the cruise control.  Well it should'nt be called cruise 
control, at present it functions more like 'launch control' since as soon as I 
activate it, the car takes off.  Since my wonderful Haynes manual doesn't go 
into any detail on many electronic systems, and also on some issues is PLAIN 
WRONG (like the computer being on the kickpanel under the left hand side of the 
steering column) I wonder if any of you guys & gals have come across the same 
problem.
	Oh, BTW if your central locking konks out but you can still hear the 
soleniod trip when activated, there is a $2.00 (yes TWO bucks) plastic linkage 
that transmits the action from the solenoid to the lock.  Mine had broken at 
the end.  30 minutes to get to, 1 minute to fix, 30 minutes to put everything 
back on AT THE LONGEST.
	Also my alarm switch is stuck, is there an easier way to get to this 
other than having my three year old boy get his arm through the vent in the 
doorshut? How does this ?!?@?! switch come out?  Oh yes I've already discovered 
that taking the electrical connector off sets the alarm off, much to the 
delight of my neighbours...

Greg,
 As a data point;  I bought my white '86 Carrera w/67K miles for $18,300
last fall ('94).  It was owned by an authorized Porsche mechanic
for the last 5 yrs. It had been upgraded to '87 style headlights (H5's), the
tires have lots of tread wear left.  Records are only complete for the last
5 yrs.  Both doors had been painted to fix dings.  A decent car but not
great car.  ($18,300 is what the owner  was paid, I payed my broker another 
$1100 on top of that.)
$19,000 for an '83 SC does seem kind of high considering you could
get a nice '84 Carrera or a decent '86.  I'd keep shopping, that car isn't 
going anywhere (at that price).

Subject: WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU ARE A PORSCHE GEEK!


Pcar people, I for one am amazed at the the huge number of posts
expressing discontent about the number of posts that have no
Porsche specific content, If you don't like it don't read it! It
is so easy as to be beyond belief. I also note that the complaining
articles contained nothing about Porsche, nothing about driving
Porsche, nothing about the Porsche asthetic, nothing about speed,
or hot metal, nothing glorious, nothing about the smell of hot oil,
nothing about the "tink-tink" sound of a cooling down air-cooled engine,
nope. Just a single complaint. Oh dear.

However, I am willing to listen to whatever anyone has to say, and in 
deference to the apparent opinion that only geeky discussion of the relative
merits of various brake pads and oils is suitable for the list, I won't 
be posting my 3000+ word article that discusses my first ever flight in a
classic 1940s North American T6, with a 600 HP Pratt and Whitney,
the glory of hot metal, hot oil, air-cooling and how I got there and back
in the 911 and the glorious parallel between warplanes and Porsches. I won't
thrill you with the story of how I took the stick, flew it for an hour
and a half, and performed aerobatics, even though it was the first time
I had ever flown any plane or even been in anything smaller than a 747.

Only some parts are about Porsche, so tough shit I won't post it. It is not 
directly about Porsche, but it celebrates the thrill of hot engines, 
and power, and engineering and machines and the people who make and use them. And 
if those are not the things that Porschephiles is about then I'm a banana, but 
since it is not directly a Porsche related article, and <gasp> is about people 
and machines I shall censor it. 

Suffice to say I drove my 911 down to Shoreham and <xxxxxxx3000 words 
deletedxxxxx> drove it back again. There, and now back to the brake pad 
discussion, are Cool Carbons OK for the street, or can I just use some old 
ones from my VW? How do I buy a used Porsche? Why is my 944 vibrating
in a funny way at idle? why can't I get my pre `87 911 into first while
it is moving? etc. etc. ad infinitum....

There, that's done it, the netcops will be on to me now, YOU'LL NEVER TAKE
ME ALIVE COPPERS, TOP OF THE WORLD MA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

What's that?

I was also worried about cooling (as I remember, the 2.7 overheated badly).
Would an oil cooler do the trick?  How hard would it be to install an oil
cooler given that the car has air conditioning (I know, you didn't know that
before).

If I bought the car and worst came to worst, how expensive would it be to
put the car back to 2.4 specs at the next overhaul?

I have just spent the last couple of weeks rebuilding the Weber 40 IDF carbs on 
my 66 912.  The problem I am having is no matter what I do I can't get the car 
to stop backfiring.  These were the first carbs I have ever rebuilt and my 
experience with carb adjustment is limited.  The backfiring was occurring 
before I rebuilt the carbs.  The backfiring is actually coming through the carb 
throats.  Occasionally it comes from the exhaust.  I have followed the 
recommendations for tuning that I have read in one of "The Maestro's" books and 
also in the Haynes Weber manual.  I do not have a air volume gauge so I have 
been using a piece of silicon tube as recommended in the Haynes manual.  One 
thing I found out is that my Webers do not have starter jets.  Both of the carbs 
have a cover plate where the starter jet assembly typically should be.  
(According to the Haynes manual).  The backfiring is worse when the engine is 
cold, but is always there.  Any info would be appreciated!

Subject: 944 grounding/AM radio noise

I'm looking to get a little more performance out of my '84 944.

No, not the motor, the AM radio.

I have a bi-amplified alpine CD player with electronic crossover, subwoofers, and 
equalizer (all alpine).  The problem is that the range on the AM radio sucks, due
to monster ignition noise.  It seems to be a grounding problem, as any change in the
electrical situation in the car will affect the amount and tone of the noise (i.e.
turn on lights, operate power window, etc. will change interference).  It has gotten
so bad that I have on occasion driven with the lights on in the daytime in order 
to be able to hear a station that I wanted to listen to.

The battery connections are clean and corrosion free.  So are the ground connections
to the firewall for the battery and engine (although they connect to different points).

I have heard that there is a "grounding mod" for early 944s that removes a ground
loop and creates a single point ground, but I do not have any details on it.

If anyone could shed some light on this I would appreciate it.  I am fairly literate
electrically, but grounding (especially on an automobile) has always seemed like a
black art to me.  I know that what looks right and sensible can often be exactly 
wrong, so I would welcome the advice of anyone who really understands the problem.

Subject: Powerless 914


I got the following from my brother. Any helpful suggestions as to what the
trouble is likely to be?

{
I think I've got a buyer for the 914, if I can get it running properly.  The 
last time I had it out about 2 years ago  as I was pulling away from a light 
there was a sort of backfire, the engine note became more gutteral and it 
had no power but would rev freely.  No great clunkings, rattles, bangs,etc.  
Yesterday I got it started without too much difficulty (cleaned the plugs, a 
real bear to get two of them out but did not take the threads out with them, 
and a squirt of ether), but it didn't heal itself over the 2 yr vacation.  
Compression is 120 to 130 in 3 and 90 in the 4th cylinder.  Timing appears 
to be ok and advances with revs.  Replaced a couple of suspicious vacuum 
hoses.  Still no power.  Looking in the manual it implies that a faulty 
pressure (vacuum) sensor or a blocked exhaust can cause lack of power under 
load.  I've got an old sensor that I replaced when it became waterlogged.  
It has dried out over the ensuing 3 years.  Iopened it, and cleaned it up, 
so will try that first.   If that doesn't do it I'll take off the muffler 
and give it a try.  It will at least sound powerful.
}

I will forward any helpful suggestions back to him. Unfortunately, I don't
know what year it is, if that matters.

Subject: Which performance street tires for 914?

I've decided to replace the 8 year old (!) 185VR70 Michelin XWX tires on my 
914, which has the Fuchs 15x5.5 alloy wheels. I would like to hear from 
fellow 914 types what a good tire would be? I already called a BFG store, 
they don't make the COMP/TA in a size I can use. This is a stock 914/2.0, no 
wheel flares, and a street car only, though sometime I would like to get 
some autocross instruction.

Suggestions, anyone?

Yep....911 brakes on the front of a 914 are incredible.  I'd *NEVER* own
a 914 with the stock binders ever again.  I've been spoiled!!!  :-)

Since this is for an autox car, you must do as Stan and numerous others
have said in the past....

     Read The Rules!!!!

I don't think cross-drilled or slotted rotors, nevermind 911 upgrades, would
be allowed in SP class.  You'd go farther up the competetive ladder.  If you
don't mind losing all the time this is OK.....but it might frustrate you 
until
your driving skills and thickness of your wallet improve.  Dave Darling has
done exceptionally well in S class with his 914 - listen to what he may have
to say.

Good luck!

Dear Chip,

My apologies to the group for the at-large posting:  for my own
reference I would want someone to correct me if I'm wrong.

Your situation is not that different from mine, with 6-inch wheels on
a '75 911 that also came with 185/70 as OE.

You are fine with 195/60 x 15, and there are a lot of tires still
available in that size, including (I think) the Comp T/A, or something
similar.  I would *think* (and I have no experience with this size, so
I'd like some confirmation) that the 195/65 would be OK also--indeed,
that they would come closest to 185/70.

On 6-inch rims on a 911, you can go to 205/60 for some brands (there
are variations despite the standard size), and to that size in general
if you have your front fender lips rolled.  With competition alignment
settings your rear camber is sufficient to prevent rubbing.

In short, the 195/60 would give you the widest choice, and you'd be
safe with them.  Some people use 195/50 for competition, but that
would be too low for the street, IMHO.

There is a speedometer error that goes along with a change in tire
size.  I had 195/60's on my 911 before I went to the 205's and it
showed at least 10% faster than I was driving.  With narrower rims the
difference will be less, probably something you could live with
without recalibration.

Hope this helps.

WAY low... I'd get it looked at pretty quick AND change the oil too!  My
'83 SC does low 20s around town, high 20s on the highway, and has topped

Subject: Re: brake proportioning valve

I (and several others--> this turned out to be a high interest subject at the
driver's ed events I have attended in last year or so) have had success in
replacing the proportioning valve on our non-ABS 944 turbos with one from a
928S4.

There have been several "technical" explanations, I can however offer some
subjective data. It DOES make a difference. I would suggest that if one changes
this valve or starts mixing brake pad compounds that this should be done with a
great deal of caution. Gradually see how it works. I have found it to be
particularly valuable in eliminating a tendancy for the nose to "dive" under
hard braking, thus making it easier to manage the balance of the car as you set
up for the corner. (my car is 90% used for track events). I have found a need
to mix the pad compounds to adapt to my driving style and skill level. Initial
tests with PFC 85 compound at all corners was starting to cause the REARS to
warp- I had to switch to PFC 83 fro the rear. What a change to only feel your
weight pressing against the harnesses instead of the whole car pitching
forward!

FYI, I saved this as one of the LAST changes I made to my brakes. I generally
follow the adage of "if it ain't broke don't fix it". Unless you are having
real braking problems there are other things to try first, ie: CoolBrake kit,
harder brake pad compounds, steel brake lines, alter your driving style, etc.

Then go for the gusto and upgrade your brakes to the Brembo 928S4 setup. Now
those are REAL stoppers!.

If the 914 is the same as VW and my 944, then a 1-7/16" socket will
do the trick (this is from memory, I hope that is correct). I think this
socket size is only available in 3/4" drive. I used to use a 3/4 to 1/2"
reducer and my 1/2" breaker bar, but I recently bought a 3/4"
breaker bar. No more worrying about breaking the breaker bar!
BTW, you also need a 4 foot long piece of 1-1/2" iron pipe to use
as a "cheater" over the breaker bar. Leave the car on the ground,
emergency brakes on, and tires blocked before applying your
weight to the cheater pipe.

This sounds like the John Muir method: a large chisel and a hammer.
While that does work, the correct tools won't bugger up the nut. And using
a socket and handle, it is possible to estimate a tightening torque. If, for
example, it needs to be 300 ft-lbs and you weigh 200 lbs, then apply
all of your weight a foot and a half out on the handle when the handle
is horizontal. Like they say, close enough for government work!

A friend of mine (wish it was me!) is negotiating to buy a
1995 911 coupe with limited slip, sport seats, rear wiper,
17 inch wheels, metallic paint....

The dealer started off by offering him 8 percent of the sticker.
========
Jim,

Re 993 prices (and 993 oil changes)
I arranged a purchase through my credit union and a San Jose
dealer for a built-to-order 993.  I got a 2.5% discount.  While
I waited in frustration for this dealer to process the
paperwork and get the factory build going I called and visited
all the bay area dealers.  I ended up in Oakland at Negherbon
Auto where I saw the car optioned as I ordered it but in a
different color.  The dealer gave me 10% off sticker (he
referred to it as the "European delivery price"), and then
offered me my asking price on the 89 911 I was selling
privately.  And this was before Porsche raised prices 2%
recently.  Yes, demand is still high for these cars but if you
look around you can do pretty well.  8% is not bad at all
based on what I've heard.

BTW, I just changed the oil at 4k miles (actually my 911
guru mechanic did it).  Had to remove one body panel below
the rockers to access one of the drain plugs (you can no
longer get to this from the wheel well), the right rear
wheel, four miscellaneous undercarriage panels, and one
heater duct.  Only then can you get to *both* oil filters.
This guy clearly knew what he was doing, and got it done in
90 minutes.  I stayed with expensive Synthetic (Amsoil
racing oil), bought factory filters (and saved the box tops),
and took a couple of extras qts under the hood.  Total price?
$230!

The factoy recommends 15k oil changes.  Hmm...maybe I'll
stretch the interval to 6k.

Fellow pfilers:

I own a 1992 911 Turbo S2 that seems to eat up front tires. The tires are
Yokohoma A-008P (205/50ZR17) on the front, and Yokohoma AVS (P275/40ZR17) on

Are Pirelli PO tires worth the price? What do other people recommend? Should

Another option is to switch to an earlier year's exhaust system. The 1975 
used a different system to allow use ofa catalytic converter for California. 
The non-California cars use a "connexion" tube in place of the CC. (The 
misspelling is from Porsche's "914 Service and Training Information, 
Model 75". I recommend picking it up from your local dealer - I guarantee 
it'll be a special order,  however the price is a scant $1.00! Part number is: 
"WKD 454 321". It shows everything that changed for the 1975 model year 
914.)
ANYways... Someone who owned my car before me replaced the exhaust 
with the '73-'74 style, which is a bit simpler, and perhaps more 
free-flowing?
BTW, I must give a quick plug to German Parts & Restoration here - I 
bought the '75 style, only to find that I had the earlier style. The box had 
gotten somewhat mangled on the way in, so I had to rebox it to ship it back 
 - they sent me a new one with no problems, no complaints, no charges, 
nothing. I've been very happy with the various dealing I've had with them 
and recommend 'em highly.

> -Greg, enjoying the fact that his car's exhaust noise

I can do that with mine, but I AM going to put new heat exhangers on it 
before spring! (I drove it most of last summer with the exchangers not 
quite reaching my nice new muffler - in other words, unmuffled. Got a 
couple pull-overs, but the muffler usually got me off with a warning.) I'm 
supposedly gonna buy a set of unused SS heat exchangers from an 
acquitance, unless someone on here has a nice set they want to let go 
cheap? '73-'74 style?

I asked the same question not a week ago, methinks. I have 195/50/15s on my 
car now, and they seem to perform very well (despite being Phoenix 
Stahlflexes, made in the late '70s/early '80s), and after some deliberation and 
feedback, have decided to go with Dr914's suggestion of 205/55/15s... I hadn't 
thought about 55-series before, but it should give me some more height and 
put more rubber on the road, yet still be low-profile enough for real 
performance. Tire of choice is, of course, the BF Goodrich Comp T/A 3 
unidirection ZR tire.

I've heard different results from 205/60/15s, some people say they rub, some 
say they don't, I think it depends upon your wheel choice - the alloys seem to 
have a lot more offset than the steel ones. (I have the stock steel wheels, and 
they're well into the wheelwell. Not the look I like, but no danger of rubbing!)

So, for what it's worth, I'd going with Comp T/A ZR 205/55/ZR15 tires. (I hate 
the idea of putting anything less than ultra-high-performance tires on my 
summer sports car! :)

Just a thought about why cars are set up with the fronts doing most of 
the work.

If you have ideal brake balance, and all 4 wheels lock at the same 
instance, then the ABS cannot tell that the wheels have locked, it 
assumes all 4 wheels stopped - car is stopped.

personally I would prefer the ABS to do it's job, than lock all four
wheels. I have seen it happen, its quite scarey, I had to break quite hard
to avoid a prang, I looked in the rear mirror to see an ABS equiped UK
ford granada smoking all 4 tyres as he headed for my rear, luckily I was
able to lift the brakes and drive out of his path.

Subject: proportioning valve 951

Thank you everyone who related experiences with the 951 brake proportioning
valve. It seems that the consensus is that the valve from a 928S4 is the one
to use for racing applications. 
It also seems that non ABS drivers need to take this step with a great deal
of caution as the ABS acts as a great safety valve.(pun?)
What I need now is the part number for that prop valve.
(Sorry Kevin I know you sent it but I deleted your post in my haste to delete
all the trash that's been showing up lately).
As for the fellow who pointed out the 99% of your braking does not involve
the ABS remember that we are discussing racing (track) situations. In this
environment the ABS comes into play at almost every corner. Especially if you
are late braking. The problem is that the ABS is multichannel so even though
the fronts are evoking the ABS it doesn't mean that the rears are at max
grab. I know that once I feel the ABS activating I don't bother pushing the
pedal any harder and this is probably the reason the rears are not being used
as much as they could.
Threshold braking is the way to go and the ABS certainly is a great crutch.
My personal tests show that my stopping distances are higher with the ABS
disconnected no matter how good a job I am doing with non ABS threshold
braking. Anyone concur?

Pete,
This can't happen with multi channel ABS since the coefficient of friction at
all wheels is never going to be the same no matter how well balanced the car
or the system. Hence one wheel will always be more prone to lockup no matter
which braking system is involved. If your theory is correct then even with a
prop valve in place if you STAND on the brakes hard enough all will tend to
lock up. I've tried this and no matter what I do the ABS always works
perfectly

I posted a message about a a possible '78 911SC  targa purchase a couple of
weeks ago.  I am happy to say that the car is mine and I couldn't be
happier<g>.  My sincere thanks to all who responded with helpful and
encouraging words.  Special thanks to x400459 for his especially thorough and
practical advices, I'm glad he stuck around inspite of his initial misgivings
about the porschephile list.  

I've already noticed that people react differently to Porsches than other
cars I've owned.  For the most part they are pleasant but some are bizzare.  

Ture story without embellishments:  The day after I bought the car, a buddy
who was in the market for a new car wanted to go price some cars.  We drove
to the local auto mall in my new baby (looks as good as the day it was
bought, by the way, no kidding <g>) and as our last stop, we stopped at the
BMW dealer.  It was getting late and we wanted to make a quick stop to check
out the M3.  As we drove into the lot, we were met by a rather aggressive
saleslady who seemed eager to get us into a car for a test drive.  The M3 was
in the showroom but they had a 540 6 speed sitting on the lot and my friend
coudn't refuse a test drive.  We both drove the car and the car was solid and
we were impressed.  However, the nice saleslady had something to prove,
perhaps us driving into the lot in the Porsche had something to do with it.
 She got behind this 55k dollar machine and said something to the effect "let
me show you what this baby can do" and proceeded to go berserk.  She took us
back to the back roads where we had just finished our test drive and started
taking corners at almost twice the speed that a reasonable persons like
myself had taken just a few minutes ago.  Inevitably she lost control and
slid off the road and slammed us into a telephone pole, totalling the car and
scaring the beejuice out of my friend and me as well as herself.  There's a
bit more to the story but suffice to say that I found out very quickly how
strongly people can react to a pcar.

Subject: My first driving event - the results

I've completed my first driving event at Texas World Speedway this weekend.  
It was a PCA Driver Education event.  I appreciate everyone's advice - all 
of it came in handy!

My impressions:

There is no substitute for a good instructor.  I was fortunate enough to try 
three different ones (including our own Scott Jessen - thanks Scott!), and 
they were all *extremely* helpful.  There is *no* way I could have driven 
that track correctly without good instruction.  You may think you can 
intuitively pick where the line should be on a new track, but you can't.

Don't be afraid to ask questions.  A lot of people at the track are busy 
running the event, or concentrating on their own driving.  Information is 
not always volunteered (except during instruction).  

Stay out of the way of macho Corvette and Mustang drivers.

The 968 is an incredible car.  It's so easy to drive.  It seemed to correct 
my mistakes for me (not that I made any!).  The car was a lot less agitated 
by the drive than I was.

Yes, I'm hooked.  No, I can't afford the tires or the wear and tear to do 
this often.  No, I don't know what I'll do about it.  Yes, I will do it again.

Perhaps the aluminum color you saw was paint.  Many people have there

my phone dials with Rustoleum from the local hardware store about a

Glad you enjoyed it!!! That first track day is alwasy the toughest.

Now, do the math: 

you drove *how many* miles on the track?? 100? *MAYBE*?? 

Let's then be really hard on ourselves and say that it was 3x tougher 
on the car than "street traffic" -- despite the fact that it's just not 
true and track miles *MAY* be better due to no stop and go. OK, great --
you penalize the life of the car by what? 300 miles, tops?

You are, however, correct on tire wear. I found that on my 911, doing
4 track days a year *PLUS* about a dozen autoxes cost me maybe 3000 
miles in tire life. Let's say it's a 50/50 deal, half the wear is due to
track days. At $768 a set, and about 15k miles to the set,
that was what? about $75 in tire wear. Which is what? 3.5 autox 
entry fees, 0.75 track day entry fees, etc.

I think you see the point I'm trying to make here...

Go to the track. DO NOT pass Go. Do not spend $200 on unnecessary 
go-fast crap. Go directly to the track...

Believe we I have seen it happen, and this was on a dry road, the car
behind we was completely enveloped in tyre smoke - all 4 wheels locked!!
Now this car had a lot less rubber than a 944T, on a dry road it is 
pretty well impossible to lock all 4 wheels on a 944 without ABS - just 
try standing on the brakes in the wet!!

The Fords use the Bosch ABS, so it is probably very similar to that 
fitted to our Porsches.

If you fit a larger slave cylinder on the back wheels, then you will tend 
to get the backs locking later, ie close to the point where the fronts 
lock, now this isn't an instantaneous thing, if it was there would be no 
problem. 

From my observations and investigations of the behaviour of the ABS system
on my wifes Ford, the cycle rate of the system is around 8 cycles per sec,
ie when a wheel locks, it is switched in and out at around 8 times per
sec.

The wheel sensors obviously have some sort of averaging electronics built 
in, this is probably done so that the ABS doesnt cut in if for example a 
wheel gets airborne for a few millisecs (pot hole etc) during that few 
msecs, all 4 wheels can and occasionally do lock. I can certainly manage 
it in the wet in my wifes car.

When you brake hard and lock all the wheels, as I stated yesterday, when 
all 4 wheels are locked, the abs thinks the car is at rest!!

Brake bias to the front is a certain way to overcome the problem of 4 
wheel lock, I would have thought that porsche would have studied this 
problem in some detail, and if they fit a certain size of slave 
cylinders, they probably have done the sums correctly. There are lots of 
things to put into the equation, number of passengers, how much fuel in 
the tank, size and make of the tyres and road surface condition.

Of course you may be absolutely correct in what you say - and you cannot 
lock all 4 wheels, its your dime - and your fender, front suspension and 
insurance premeium!!!

The important ground connection is the one from the radio case to ground, 
the co-ax shield should also be grounded at the radio, ie make sure it is 
plugged fully home into the radio (hope you have 18 inch fingers )

Normally the antenna body is also earthed to the bodywork on stick 
arials, but it is a matter of dispute whether this is really desireable, 
because you now have a wire from the radio to car body, and this can pick 
up induced engine noise. In digital electronic systems such as telephone 
exchanges, it is conventional to connect only one end of a screen wire to 
earth.

The other possible noise source is the 12v supply, you can try fitting 
one of the many available noise filters. In fact from your description 
this sounds like the probable cause - arcing alternator brushes perhaps.

If you think you have problems, try getting a radio to work in a GRP car

Well, we've not had one GM make it to 150,000 (even with engine rebuilds 
and all) and even the current (and last of our) GM product is giving 
signs of death at 135,000 miles... now, before you say, that's a lot for 
an engine, it's been only 10,000 miles since rebuild (of the whole 
engine, transmission, and all), and never has one single electical 
component worked right (excepting those we have replaced ourselves, like 
windshield washer pump, air conditioner, and power window switches... oh 
and the power windows for that matter!) Never once has GM even remotely 
offered us any help in these areas after hours of nagging them...

Now, for you people who love Porsche-talk.... The Porsche (a 73) has gone 
140,000 miles, and yet, it still goes strong and could easily be used the 
way it was for its first year (where it put 50k miles on as a daily driver)

Dear Josh and Nate and all,

To get great 914 brakes and avoid expense, assuming you have good equipment,
upgrade in the following progression:

     1. Carbon Kevlar brakes pads:  higher coefficient of friction, great
braking increase
     2. 19mm master cylinder:  firmer pedal, less travel, more foot pressure
required
     3. Stainless steel brake lines:  less restrictive (than old deposited
lines), less flex, more positive pedal feel
     4. larger 911T front calipers:  larger piston for better grip, lightens
the feel of the 19mm master cylinder.
     
As one of the cross drilling companies told me, drilled rotors are hype
except in extreme racing conditions. Vent cool air on your rotors before
drilling them. "We drill the rotors because they make us good money."

Riviera wheels are junk and there is no such thing as an original. They were
all cheap imitations.

Originally intended to fit a VW Bug, these wheels have an offset towards the
outside (since Bugs have fenders that hang on to the body). When fitted to a
914, they stick out so far that the widest tire becomes only a 195x60x15 and
even this tire rubs one fender lip. Throw these wheels away and buy a set of
factory Fuchs for your car or at least a set of the cheap American Eagle
Fuchs reproduction wheels.

However, if you are on a budget and have broken one of you currently
installed Rivieras, they are available in three varieties:
     5" 3-1/8" center hole (used)

Dear Pete,

Most "73 911T engines had mechanical fuel injectin while 1973-1/2 USA 911Ts
had CIS injection. Both had 140 HP, but the CIS car had 8.0:1 compression
while the mechanically injected car was 7.5:1. The mechanically injected car
could be recognized by its roundish six fuel-lined connected fuel distributor
head and rectangular air cleaner cover as well as its ribbed tall mounted air
intake boot. Mechanical injection had a left front mounted belt driven fuel
injection pump and a massive left to right connected air filter with an
intake snout attached. Both engines will work well in a 914. The CIS engine
will need the intake boot modified to clear the rear engine lid latch
receiver while the mechanically injected engine needs the fuel pump changed
and a tube welded onto the heat exchanger chamber to provide hot air to the
injection pump for warmup.

The best way to check the engine is with a leakdown check (cylinder
differential pressure test). This test will tell you the condition of the
valves, head gaskets and piston rings. Also change the oil and check the sump
screen for debris.

Subject: Flaming George

This is sort of non-P car content, so I apologize in advance to anyone who's mail
reader is overloaded, but I just couldn't let it pass.

The other day someone flamed George Buselinck for selling a 944 chip to a friend, 
even though George apparently didn't pay for the chip, but got it through his 
contacts in the industry.  Since no one else has leapt to George's defense, I will.

It seems to me that George does this for a living, and has every right to charge
a fair market price for anything that he disposes of.  This is how he puts food 
on his family's table folks!

Besides - If he got the chip through contacts, then he performed work (i.e. phone
calls, lunches, etc.) in exchange for the chip, and he deserves to be paid for that 
work.  He may have spent many times the value of the chip to cultivate the relation-
ship that got him the chip.

IMHO, it would have been wrong for his friend to expect to get the chip for free,
and if he is a friend, I'm sure he never asked.  His friend just probably assumed 
that he would pay fair market value, and I'm sure that's what he paid.  

George contributes his knowledge and experience to this list every day,and doesn't 
charge a cent for it (although he does get some well deserved good will and free 
advertising).

Hi,

the real cause of Senna's accident has been uncovered
according to an Italian racing magazine:

The steering column had been shortened to accomodate 
Senna's driving position. The soldering was not thick 
enough to withstand the rigorous conditions of the race 
and just gave away on the curve, leaving Senna with a useless
steering wheel in his hand. That is why, the car went straight
off the track as if there was no one steering it.

There was no driver error. Only not enough soldering.

Ouch. To loose the capability of steering at that speed.

I recently read almost the same thing but this article claimed
that the steering column had been cut and and a new piece with
less diameter and less thickness was welded on. And it was the
tube that could'nt stand the stresses.

The williams team is now worried about the economical consequenses
this can have on the team. They might have to pay so much that
it will mean the end to the team.

pfiles,
Does anyone know of a good way to isolate a problem between the alternator
and voltage regulator. My alternator light is on all the time now on my 
73.5 911T. After charging the batteries and starting the car I checked across
the batteries with a volt meter and I'm only getting 12v. Are there some test   
points where I could check the voltage before the regulator?
Could I disconnect the regulator and check alternator voltages?
Should I just buy another regulator sinces its cheaper than the alternator?
Maybe I should buy them both?

sorry for choosing the wrong word.

"Welding" is the correct word.

Well, I don't know about the rest of you but (knock on wood) my
GM/Chevrolet Astro van has been pulling my 914 race car and trailer (yes,
over 4500 pounds) for over four years now.  Just this weekend on the way
back to the San Francisco area from the SCCA San Diego National Tour the
speedo rolled over to 250,000 miles.  Never a problem if the engine is
taken care of properly.  I've replaced the a/c compressor and water pump
once each and most recently the fuel pump.  Other than frequent oil and
oil filter changes (3K miles) and the tranny oil, filter change (every
season) and other regular maintenance all runs fine.  And this vehicle is
used every day in my contracting business.  I have noticed a slight drop
in pulling power up some of the grades so instead of doing 50 I know have
to be happy at 40.  I have installed a tranny cooler to help with the 
towing.  I just think it helps to maintain the vehicle we all drive

Subject: 944 AM radio reception and engine noise

>RE: Engine noise on the AM radio, or stereo in general

I'll post this for the benefit of the entire group.  I have answered 
this questions privately a couple of times already so this time it goes 
out to all:

Unless the engine noise just appeared after replacing spark plug wires 
or a coil or something engine related, the odds are very good that the 
problem is in the stereo installation.  It's sort of a good news/bad 
news scenario.  The good news is that it can be fixed, the bad news is 
that there's no "quick fix".  First a quick backgrounder...

Your car has enormous amounts of wire running through it, most of those 
wires are connected to the + side of the battery, the grounding for 
these circuits is handled by the metal chassis of the car.  That 
explains why there is a big braided strap from the - side of your 
battery directly to the chassis on your car.  By doing it this way, the 
manufacturer is spared the trouble of running a seperate ground wire 
back to the negative post of the battery for each circuit....saves wire, 
saves money, saves weight.  This is the way virtually every car on the 
road is built.  The problem with it is that the path that the 
electricity takes through your car to get back to the battery is not 
predictable.  It will follow the "least resistive" path and this path 
will vary depending on what other accessories happen to be turned on 
(headlights, brake lights, fans, etc.)  For each ground path, there is 
an electrical field and that can induce noise into things like the RCA 
cables of a stereo system.  When this tiny electrical noise is fed 
through an amplifier, it becomes audible as "engine noise".

There are a few things you can do to help reduce the chances of getting 
inducted noise in your stereo.

1.  Make sure that when the stereo is installed, that the person keeps 
the power wires for amplifiers as far away from the signal wires (RCA 
cables) as possible.  A typical power wire puts out 14.4V whereas the 
RCA cables are sending mere millivolts of power.  It is very easy to 
induce noise into an RCA cable because the original signal is so much 
smaller.

2.  Make sure that the grounds from all the various components are tied 
to a single point on the car's chassis.  DO NOT RUN THESE GROUNDS TO THE 
NEGATIVE BATTERY POST!  The battery post is the single noisiest 
grounding point in any car, due to alternator "ripple" when the engine 
is running.  Many novices make this mistake.  Doing it the right way 
actually takes less time and wire.  Find a convenient place, get all of 
your wires consolidated into a "ring-type" connector, then use a grinder 
or sandpaper to clean the chassis to bare, shiny metal.  Secure your 
grounds to the chassis using a bolt with star washers to keep it tight.  
Then spray the area with paint or something waterproof to keep moisture 
out of your connection.  This will prevent an eventual problem with bad 
grounding.  Remember that there are many paths the electricity will take 
through your chassis to get back to the battery.  You may not find the 
perfect grounding spot on your first try.  Sometimes finding a "clean" 
spot takes a couple tries.  Once you think you have one, be sure to run 
the engine, turn on the headlights, push the brake pedal, etc. to check 
for noise or "pops" through the stereo.  This will help you determine if 
you've selected a good grounding point.

3.  Use components with high undistorted output voltage.  This one's 
tougher, especially if you already have equipment that you're not 
willing to replace.  High voltage output means that you will be sending 
a higher voltage signal through your RCA wires which will be much less 
suseptible to picking up inducted noise.  Most consumer grade decks put 
out maybe 1 volt of output.  There are decks however that put out 3 to 4 
volts, and the difference in clarity is amazing!  Keep in mind that the 
more power you can send from the "front-end" of your system, the less 
"gain" you'll need to use on your amplifiers.  This will make a dramatic  
difference in the amount of engine noise you hear.


The lesson in all of this is to take the time to carefully plan the 
selection of your components, and have a good grasp of the factors that 
are working against you in the car environment.  If this is beyond what 
you want to tackle yourself, find a professional to help you.  This 
response has gotten really long, but there's quite a bit more to say on 
the topic.  If people are interested I can answer more here or you can 
ask me questions off-line.  I'll be doing a complete high-end system in 
a 911 soon, (I still need the car) so I'd be happy to explain the steps 
I go through during that installation.

Solder can be plenty strong if properly applied.
Stronger, for instance, than the materials it is
joining. It doesn't work for steel on steel, 
but I don't actually know what Williams makes their
steering columns out of.

When is Porsche getting back into F1?

Does anyone know of a good independent Porsche repair shop in the
Sacramento, CA area?  A friend of mine is in need of clutch work, He
couldn't deal with the dealers price of $2300 for a clutch job.  Please
reply via E-mail as I am not currently subscribed to the list.

Subject: need inside door handle for '77 911


I was driving a friend's '77 911 last weekend, and when I
pulled the latch to get out of the car, it broke off 
in my hand. Although it seems like inferior engineering
compared to the metal latch on my '73 I still felt like
a dork and offered to replace it for him. The replacement
latches are $40 ea. from Porsche. If there's someone who
has replaced theirs with the alloy type and has a driver's
door latch available, I'd be willing to pay a reasonable
price. Anybody know, off hand, how much the alloy type cost?
I remember seeing them in Performance Products catalog but
I don't have the catalog anymore.

You also need to cut access hatches so you can set the injection. On
the MFI, it's in the seat-back firewall; on the CIS, it's in the trunk.

Cool Carbon pads, or equivalent, are just about a requirement for full-time

break-in proceedure to the exact letter, they are a disaster waiting to
happen on the street. I use street pads on the street on all of my cars.

If you need a master cylinder, it's foolish not to make this upgrade. Unless
you run in a class where it matters. Like any of the stock classes. Then
it's another of those silly upgrades that has you running with the Big Boys.
Know what your terminal application is before you buy *ANYTHING*.

This is just plain stupid and dangerous. You use braided lines on race cars
where you need the greater strength and where everything is made of braided
line anyway. You take them off and throw them away at the end of the  season.
EVERY YEAR. If you do much endurance racing, you do it sooner.

Why? The inner hose abrades on the braided cover. You can't see it. Then,
typically when you most need it, the line blows out *FROM THE INSIDE* due
to overpressure on the weakened spot. Even the full time major league racers
are starting to re-think this one, reasoning being that if you are just 
going to throw the damned things away anyway, why not use something that you
can actually inspect for problems....

And I haven't even begun to talk about the rash of badly assembled units that
popped up a few years ago where the ends would pull off the hose....

Yeah, if you want to spend a few $K.... Figure $650-$1k for the 911 front
end (and it really doesn't matter which one). Figure another few $x00 to
fix the rear end so it now has 5-lug wheels to keep you from looking 
stupid. Figure at least $150 a wheel for some 15x6 911 wheels. Sure, cheap,
effective. My ass. 

And you don't even want to contemplate what that does to you, class-wise,
if you drive the car competitively.

Truth!!

But here's the other half: for real racing applications, you use rotors with
holes cast into the rotors. If you drill the rotors, you break the crystalline
structure of the metal and induce stress risers; if you cast the holes in,
you get lighter rotors, some cooling function, and all that jazz. So if
you are in the racing biz, you probably already know this, if you aren't
you don't need the holed rotors anyway. Needless to say, the drilled rotors
are unsafe, will *break* and can hurt you as a result.


Moral:  Just because something is good for racing doesn't mean *ANYTHING*
        about how good it is for *YOUR* car on the street. Magazines are
	in business to sell copies so they can sell advertising. You 
	simply *CAN* *NOT* believe everything you read in them. Even Pano.

Subject: Value of 56 Speedster


 Hello,
       I am new to porschephiles and am interested in someday obtaining a 356 m
odel to restore.  I would like some opinions on the value of a particular car that I saw for sale in Hemmings.  This 56 speedster sounds rough, it needs a floor pan and longitudinals , is missing the engine and most of the interior including the seats and  come with a removeable hardtop which i thought was not an
 option on the speeedster until later.  Needless to say this car sounds like it
needs a tremendous amount of work with some serious rust problems and requirement of many replacement parts.  I am interested in a longterm project of restoration to near original specs and I would be keeping the car I restore.  The asking price is $5,500.  Given the status of the car and the likelyhood of it being in worse condition than the description, this price seems high, even considering the car's potential value if properly restored.  If salvageable, would $2000 be insulting.

 Any opinions?  I hope this post qualifies for content on proschephiles.

George,
I have learned that the engine has mechanical fuel injection.  Is the heat exchanger
chamber you mentioned the one for providing heat to the passenger compartment?
As in I must use the expensive 914/6 heat exchangers rather than 914/6 headers?

Also a friend told me that the fuel injection pump (the belt driven one) is a VERY expensive
item to replace.  Should this be a concern?  I would imagine that it would wear out eventually.

Thanks,
Pete

Correct, but not only that, there was only one size engine used on fatory
914/6s. A 2.0L six was the only engine used on the factory sixes.
I don't know the proper numbers as far as engine cases and all, but serial

          Hi all,
          
          A friend, who is without access to the net, purchased an 83 944 
          which needed much head work, among other things.  The car has 
          about 120,000 on the odo.  After about 10 months of work on it, 
          we finally got it running 2 weeks ago (lack of time and money to 
          get it done faster, as well as many mistakes- wish I had 
          subscribed to the list when we started).  The motor runs great.  
          Now here is the problem:   
          
          The car was on jacks the whole time, and last weekend we took it 
          off, to test drive the car.  When the ignition is off, the trans 
          has no problem getting into gear, but once the car is started, it 
          will not go in gear.  When started in 1st, the car lurches 
          forward, even with the clutch depressed.  We bled the clutch line 
          (found lots of air n nasty stuff...), the clutch feels better, 
          but still does not engage.  I called the local Porsche dealer and 
          they said that, because the car was inactive for a long time, the 
          pilot bearing had frozen (rusted) to the input shaft, and that 
          this happens often in areas of high humidity (like Washington, 
          DC).  
          Their solution is this:  find a spot, like a deserted parking 
          lot, start the car and warm it up.  Then shut it off, put it in 
          1st, start it again and accelerate hard and jam it into 2nd!  
          They say that they have a 95% success rate in unfreezing the 
          bearing that way.  Has anyone had a similar experience?  Does 
          this actually work?  We'd like to get another opinion before we 
          try this.  We not against taking the trans off, just don't have

In response to the message by Darren Foo:
Buy some of the magnetic material you see on the back of refridgerator

Then put the magnets on your car.  Even better, apply a couple of coats 
of wax over the area where the stickers/magnets will be.  Thus you will 
be able to remove the stickers easily and will not scratch (or it will be 
harder to scratch) the paint with the magnets.  You could put a bit of 
tape that leaves very little residue when removed on the leading edge of 
the stickers/magnets if you experience ...lift!  Even Scotch tape may be 
adequate.  (I have not needed the tape yet).

Note that the pilot bearing is separated from the input shaft by the torque 
tube and drive shaft...  I would think that the pilot bearing itself is 
seized.....

I wouldn't jam it into 2nd, but rather depress the clutch and stand on the
brakes at the same time.  If it doesn't kill the motor, it might just work.
Jamming it into 2nd will just crash the gears...

Well, a 95% success rate also implies a 5% failure rate.  If the failure
rate includes hitting something or breaking a gearbox, then the odds are not
quite in your favor.  The proper way to fix it is to disassemble the drive
line and figure out what the problem is.

New pilot bearings only cost about $20. Clutch parts are fairly expensive,
but PAR automotive in Yonkers is advertising a complete set for $440. I'll
sell you used, but serviceable parts for much less than that...

(Keep in mind I got them for free, but after all, I'm a Porsche-owning
capitalist these days... :-)  )

Subject: BUYING VERY LIMITED-EDITION FROM DEALER - NEED ADVICE

I've never bought a new car before, but it looks like I will shortly.  I
would appreciate any advice netters have on negotiating a price on a very
limited-edition car ...

The car in question is the BMW M3 Lightweight - only 70 cars will be made,
21 of which will be on the West Coast, where I live.  It's basically a
stripped / lightened version of the M3 with some race-oriented performance
enhancements. The cars are sold by special order only, and are allocated to
individuals and dealers on a first-come, first-served basis, but if you're
already on the list, the actual time of order is not important (or so I'm
told). Due to some correspondence I had with BMWNA last September, it
appears that I am "way up at the top of the list" in terms of guaranteeing
a unit in my name. 

My question is pretty simple - how does one go about negiotiating price
(there are a few options available (adjustable suspension, adjustable
camber plates, etc.) on this car?  Is there really any room to manouver in
such a situation, where demand may very well outstrip supply, but to an
extent the car is reserved for the prospective buyer (me)?  Am I naive to
assume that this is a bit different from the case where a dealer orders the
car and then holds out for the highest bidder?

BMWNA says the cars will only be made available to dealers, and the dealer
I spoke with (so far I'm on good terms with them) is asking for a small,
non-refundable deposit / downpayment. I presume brokers cannot "get in" on
this sort of deal.

Thanks for any insight / advice you may have on this matter.

Subject: Lacquer paint jobs

Lacquer used to be the medium of choice for spot repairs, since you
could experiment with tinting and quickly redo mistakes, so there are
a whole bunch of cars out on the road with spot and panel repairs in
lacquer.  Also, most touch-up paint is lacquer.  It dries quickly, and
even cured lacquer will come off with lacquer thinner.

Body shops have been forced to change due to environmental
restrictions--one of the few environmentally-induced changes that have
been for the better.  Now they use urethanes and/or water-based
paints.  The same goes for most factories.

In the past, Porsche and the other German cars all used enamels;
these, in recent years, have gone over to urethanes.  GM was the only
American carmaker to use lacquer.  Rolls-Royce used lacquer, I think
Jaguar also.  Anytime you hear someone brag about the number of coats
in a paint job, you can bet it's lacquer, since enamels are a one-shot
deal.

Lacquer was popular for high-end repaints in the 70s.  In the case of
a Rolls or a Cadillac it made sense, since that was how the factory
did it.  But it was used for other cars as well.  The advantages are
relatively few, as I see them:  the material is harder, but less
resilient.  Since it gets its shine from buffing to begin with, it
will respond better to rubbing out scrapes and such.  Other than the
non-originality factor, a major disadvantage is that you cannot
use lacquer thinner for leveling or correcting touch-ups.

A recent lacquer repaint would be unusual, since most body shops have
stopped using it.  

My ex-wife's 66 Mustang had an acrylic enamel repaint in '83.  When I
was in charge of its maintenance the car looked great; now it's gone
downhill :-).  But it was enamel over a lacquer primer.  Try to touch
up a chip, and the enamel will lift.  IOW, lacquer never dies:  it
will always succumb to solvent.  

To put some closure on this, my own impulse would be to stay away from
a lacquer job on a Porsche.  But if the car is otherwise straight and
well-priced, and if you have a source for lacquer repairs, and if
you're not a purist, you might still consider it.

Subject: Re: frozen pilot bearing

I did this on an old plymouth wagon, so-

start in gear, let it roll, then apply the brakes. If it doesn't break
loose before the engine is about to stall, get it back up to speed and try
again, harder.

this technique has two advantages:
1. you can generate more negative load using the brakes than positive load
using the accelerator. And, as we all know, ots the absolute value of the
load that matters, not the sign.
2. you have more control and can apply the load over a longer time.

anyway, it woiked fine on da wagon.

There is another possibility.  The clutch plate may be corroded to the
flywheel.  I had this happen several times on old Saab 96's.  Engine
would run fine in nutral but you couldnt get into gear.  Pulled engine
and found that the clutch plate was frozen to the flywheel,  pried it
off with a screwdriver (came off real easy once the engine was out;-). 
Same thing happened a second time after the car had a extended period of
inactivity.  Since I knew what the likely problem was and I didn't want
to pull the engine, I sepped on the clutch and rammed it into gear -
broke free with no other problems.  Since the whole 96 cost less than
the clutch parts for a 944 I wouldnt use this method.

hope this helps, and let me know what it turns out to be.

Finally got round to starting prep for Drivers Ed in April. As several of you 
advised last year (advice received with thanks) aligning go fast and go slow 
pedals for heel and toe turned out to be easy. Removed seat, carpet and floor 
board (yep they are called floor boards becos they used to be boards, have 
driven many a mile watching the black top pass below), pulled back accelerator 
pedal and extended rod to limit then adjusted brake pedal to master cylinder rod
for final alignment. Perfect, no blocks, no add on pedal, no grunge. Also fitted
Weltmeister short shift kit, almost as easy but broke shift knob trying to 
remove it for transfer, still needs final adjustment but looks good in garage 
need final road test before claiming complete success.
Now I really need HELP! Have removed intercooler and intake plenum and can 
actually see and reach plugs, injectors and valve cover nuts on right bank of 
cylinders and have found several items I didn't know existed, one of which is 
air (smog) pump. Still cannot even see never mind get to plugs, injectors and 
valve covers of left hand bank.
Question(s), what else needs to come off and how, to get to left bank of 
cylinders so I can do plugs, check injectors etc.? Cannot get drive belt to the 
air pump adjusted either, runs out of travel on the adjuster, how do I get it 
off and back on? should I even bother? what happens if I don't? this is a CA car

  I think that you answered your own question. Where demand is higher
than supply (in a free market economy) if ya wana play.....you *will*
pay. Why would you ask the dealer to take less of a profit from
selling it to you when Mr. X will pay more? Sounds like the only
negotiation you have is if you *can* buy the car. If you have a bill of sale
stating the VIN# and the agreed price, for the dealer to sell (that car) to
anyone else would be a breach. The same thing happened to a friend of mine
with the new Corvettes. He had a bill of sale without a vin # but an agreed
upon price. Guess what? His car didn't "arive" until the market stoppped
rallying (sp). I guess I would try to get a bill of sale with a VIN# on it.

      Porsche has been known to give consideration beyond the factory
warranty, and even to 2nd owners, but if it is driveline related you must
have an excellent service history to start with.  In addition you must
present the car to an authorized dealer who will then contact PCNA for you.
 The big problem comes if you have an internal problem say in the engine or
trans. then you pay for teardown with no promise as to what Porsche will do,
so you take you chances, but it may be worth it.  What exactly are you

Yup....this can happen even if you are careful and do everything you can

front
rotors and was careful about hole placement and brake pad break-in.
He followed the correct warm-up and cool-down procedure for the brakes

I've always hated the flimsy plastic handles in my '83... talk about a
disconnect between the solid feel of the car and the cheesy feel of the
handle!  But I've also hated PP's price (several dozen dollars I recall)
enough to live with the plastic.  Thus when the most recent *Automashin'*
sale rolled around with "Metal Latch Handles" for about $20, I fell for
it.  In spite of some, uh, misgivings.

Wrong move.  First there was the $8.95 "shipping and handling" charge (I
live about 70 miles from them).  Then I opened the box and examined my
prizes.  Can you say Pot Metal?  Heavy, shoddily-molded, flaking-black-
paint Pot Metal?  Dr. Fuhrmann would spin in his grave if I put these on
a Porsche... they'd look like sh*t on a Yugo.

Anyway that's it for me and *Automashin'*, I have bought one shoddy-part-
at-Porsche-prices too many from them.  Just looking at all the useless
crap they hawk in their catalog makes my blood pressure rise now...
Bart! Help!  More of the little blue ones!

So good luck with your door-handle quest.  If anyone finds a well made
reasonably priced item that fits an '83 I'd love to hear about it...

Subject: Re: ABS Brake Bias

This is hearsay and not first hand knowlege.  Please douse all flame
throwers.  

I was told by a Chrysler design engineer that they design ABS brake systems
with deliberate bias to allow the rear brakes to lock up long before the
fronts.  This will allow the ABS system to operate properly. If one or more
wheel locks up, the computer kicks in the system.  If all four corners lock
up at the same time with the clutch in, the computer thinks that the car is
at rest and will not activate. I do not know if this is true of the Porsche
system.  

At the Northern New Jersey Region PCA Track Instructors Meeting, we spent
quite a bit of time discussing the pros/cons of ABS on the track.  There are
rumors that certain PCA regions are going to request? or demand? that
entrants in drivers ed track events disconnect the their ABS.  If anyone is
certain this is true, please let me know the particulars.  NNJR is not
entertaining this idea, but we are trying to gather factual information.

There is another rumor that  Porsche ABS and/or the braking system may fail
to operate properly when a car is spinning backwards.  This does not make
sense, but is the suppossed basis for the region(s) disconnecting the ABS.
 Any FACTS on this subject would also be appreciated.

The point that was discussed at length concerned the teaching of "in a spin,
both feet in, wheel straight" .  Our 60+ instructors don't have ABS and/or
have little or no experience spinning backwards.  As we all know, the ABS
cars will at some point hook up and launch in unpredictable directions when
spinning, but that is about as far as any of us go.

Subject:  Re: ABS Brake Bias -Reply


Regarding ABS and spins on the track:
Since I just happen to have some experience with both, I'll 
give my $.02.

I've found the ABS on the RS America to be quite effective
on the track so far.  In one respect, it is nice to be able to 
squish (not smash) the pedal without having to worry as much
about modulation.  This is particularly of benefit in braking
zones that are bumpy.  On the other hand, I'm still not 
completely at ease knowing that some piece of software 
is always going to guess correctly in all circumstances.  

In spin conditions I unfortunately don't recall whether there
were any problems with the ABS disabling while not going
forwards, as I was busy planting my feet on the floor while
being taken in by the 360 degree panoramic view of my 
surroundings.  One incident that did strike me as interesting,
in this regard, was a Euro Carrera cup race last year.  I don't
remember the venue (possibly Jerez) where the 1st and 2nd
place cars came through the last turn for the check(qu)ered flag.
The guy in the 2 spot early apexed the corner and collected
the leader causing both of them to lose it.  The leader (Alzen?)
proceeded to back into the pit wall (rear tires turning as if in
reverse) and managed to crunch the engine to a 4cyl  :-(.
What struck me was that you would think that when the car
began to spin, he'd have the brakes on.  If the Cup cars do
employ ABS, and he had it on, what you say might very well
be correct.  If not, then he had his brain disabled...

I used Cool Carbons very successfully on our street/track 911E for several

not.  Also use Cool Carbons on my wife's Audi 200 Quattro.  The ONLY pad for

SCCA  protest gestapo may make an issue of it at a national event, if anyone
thought to protest.  It is not visible once the installation is made. It is
legal for PCA Parade, and many PCA regions use Parade rules for their events.
Frequently, these 19 mm masters are cheaper than the stock 17mm master. Pedal
feel is much improved over the best stock 914.

Talking braided lines:

Stan has a point here.  My mileage and experience was excellent on street
cars; no failures.  I was VERY careful on installation. But good new stock
lines are infinitely better that old swollen lines.  Difference between new
stock lines and new braided lines is very small.

On 911 brakes for 914's.  I agree that this is not a cheap mod.  For the
street, don't bother.  For the track, probably worth it for drivers schools.
 914 brakes are marginal at best. But competitively, CHECK THE RULES.  Again
legal for PCA Parade.

One mod no one brought up: replace the stock proportioning valve with
adjustable one from the many advertisers.  The stock design IMHO sucked.  Too
large, too much volume, and it significantly to soft pedal.  I would NEVER
replace one with a new stock one. But adjust it carefully according to the
instructions that come with it.

Of course, YMMV.

Regarding the frozen pilot bearing, this has got to be another dealer trying to 
wrench some good cash from an unsuspecting owner.  Good job you're on the net!  
There is NO WAY it'll be a frozen pilot bearing, since the transmission is 
obviously turning.  
	The clutch plate has stuck to the flywheel my friend, and this is a normal 
problem for cars that have been standing for a while.  The "Ringo's patented 
technique" for freeing said item is to indeed find a clear bit of tarmac, start 
the car up in first gear and keep your foot oscillating on the clutch pedal ALL 
the time, whilst alternating oscillations on the gas pedal and brake pedal to keep 
engine from over-revving or stalling.  This is worth a couple of laps around the 
car park, and it *SHOULD* release the plate.  If not, it's tranny off, unbolt 
clutch cover plate, release friction plate, inspect (put at least new throw 
bearing in) and rebuild.

Scott,

I just recently solved the same problem with my 66 912 so I may be able to
help but need more information.  You say the carbs have just been rebuilt. 
Did you 
map out the jets (numbers for idle, main, air correcttion, idle, emulsion
tube, and venturi size) on all four circuits?  Without "as founds" it is
difficult to get to "as lefts".  You are REALLY going to need an air flow
indicator (they are not all that expensive) and an accurate tachomteter (I use 
 a  Fluke 88 automotive voltmeter with the RPM 80 attachment.  REALLY

expensive).  I've never seen the starter 
jet circuits except in books so I doubt if they are all that necessary.  You
also need to set the throttle linkages precisely.  I've developed a novel
approach for this and will include this my next mail along with jet maps etc
(after I dig them out, the problem with extensive documentation).  Are you
running the stock air filters or K&N's (or, god forbid, velocity stacks)?  Big 
 bore kit or standard p&c's?  Fuel pressure regulator?  Got the valve

adjustment and timing spot on?  As we used to say to VW customers, "When the

    All right, on to the subject of this post.  I have a stock

it.  Of course, I could always repair the miniscule cracks in it and
leave it as is (if anyone wants info on this, email me, I did one hell
of a job on the '49 Chevy wheel on my wall, if I do say so meself...)
but I would like the feel of a leather wheel.  I have seen recovering
kits for stock leather wheels, anyone ever used one of these?  Do you
know if they are made to make a hard plastic wheel look like it came
with leather?
    If not, does anyone know of a source for a chunk of leather about

be willing to give me detailed dimensions of the cover and the wheel it
goes on so's I can take a stab at designing my own?
    Yes, I've seen the ads for "wheelskins" and they look cheesy to me -
one step above the perforated vinyl ones like they sell at Kmart.  I
want something that is shaped around the four little areas where the
spokes connect - basically inconspicuous.  Yeah, a little picky for
someone who thinks red oxide primer is a perfectly good color for a car,
but what can I say?  I'm anal about the details.
    If I go through with this and it actually works, rest assured I'll

Subject: Re: Which performance tires for 914


Steve-

I read your reply to Chip, and noticed you said speedometer
error goes along with a change in tire size, and that your
speedometer showed at least 10% error (faster) when you
changed from 195/60's to 205/60's, on 15" rims.  I might
be all screwed up (It certainly wouldn't be the first time.), but
I don't think a 10% error is possible, and further, I think any
error would be in the other direction.  The 195/60 tire on a 15"
rim has a nominal diameter of 24.21 inches.  The 205/60 has
a diameter of 24.68.  The difference is 1.9%, nowhere near 10%.
The 205's, with their larger diameter will make fewer turns
per unit diatance, and hence tend to give a lower reading
on the speedometer (by about 1.9%). 

I calculated diameter as follows:

195/60    Tire height is 195 x .6 = 117mm x (25.4mm/in) = 4.61"
          
          Diameter is 15" + 2 x 4.61" = 24.21"

205/60    Tire height is 205 x .6 = 123mm x (25.4mm/in) = 4.84"

           Diameter is 15" + 2 x 4.84 = 24.68"

These are nominal diameters, because when the tire is loaded down the
actual diameter is less.  But it'll be close to this.  I don't think it'll
be off be much.  Can some tire expert out there correct me if I'm wrong?  
All this tire stuff is new to me.

Dear Bob,

The speedo error was when I went from 185/70 (Chip's current size) to
195/60.  That's been mitigated somewhat by going to the 205's, but
it's still on the fast side.  His rims are 5.5; mine are 6, so the
change won't be exactly the same.  Basically, he's gone from the
stock 165/80 to the now-outdated 185/70, so he's already running a bit
fast; going to 195/60 will make the error worse, but unavoidable.
Having the speedo recalibrated is the only permanent fix--that is,
provided 60-series tires don't go out of production!

Sorry for the confusion and thanks for responding.

Paul quotes, " ...Then shut it off, put it in 1st, start it again and
accelerate hard and jam it into 2nd!  They say that they have a 95% success
rate in unfreezing the bearing that way...."

And,100% success in tearing up a perfectly good transmission!

The proper approach to solving this not-uncommon problem is to find that
deserted stretch of road, put the car in first gear and start the engine WITH
THE CLUTCH DEPRESSED.  If you're fortunate, you'll motor away immediately
with a slight stumble (clutch still depressed...feels strange doesn't it?).
 Keep the clutch on the floor, one hand on the ignition key, watch where
you're going, and alternately accelerate and quickly back off the throttle.
 Just a few cycles of accelerating up to 3000-4000 rpm and backing off the
throttle (clutch still on the floor) will usually break it loose.  Maybe it
will take more than a few cycles, but it will eventually come loose (100% -
not 95% - guaranteed).  Also, works quicker if you can find a hill to climb
while doing it.  Don't let the engine over-rev when the clutch breaks loose,
and keep your eyes on the road!  This doesn't damage anything, it's cheap,
and the clutch will behave in a perfectly normal fashion afterward.

I have done this at least a couple of times straight out of the garage, in
reverse, but I do NOT recommend that.

To keep it from happening again, lower the humidity in your garage or drive
the car periodically to exercise the clutch (and all the other mechanical
goodies).

Good luck,

I have an '84 944 and I hated the yellow on black gauges soooo much that I

the same except for a different scale on the oil pres. (10 bar instead of
5, wow now I can actually read it when the car is cold, and the lack of an

proper, flat instrument glass. A little more glare in the day, but the
gauges now look real pro.

The reason I did the above as opposed to going with the colour gauge faces
is that I wanted to keep the gauges looking somewhat stock in appearance
(ie. - vdo logo, etc.)

In any case, do the colour guys look cool or not ????

Subject: 944: firewall repair

	When the free-play in my clutch pedal increased rather
noticably, i suspected the clutch slave and/or master cylinder(s)
had finally worn out after 10+ years of service ('83 944). Upon
inspection, the cylinders showed no sign of leakage, but instead,
the firewall was seriously cracked at the point where the master
cylinder meets it.  I'm thinking the failure in the firewall has
allowed the master cylinder to move forward, thus affecting the
linkage to the pedal, resulting in more free-play.

My mechanic intends to weld a patch over the fractured portion
of the firewall with a MIG welder.  So my question is:  what kind
of material is the firewall in an '83 944 made of?  I heard Porsche
used carbon-fibered composite steel way back in those days, so if my
firewall is indeed made of this material, wouldn't it need to be TIG
welded, rather than MIG welded?  Or is MIG welding sufficient?

The fracture is located between between the booster (which will be
removed to get at the hole) and the harness (which will remain in
place, but covered by wet rags during the welding). I'm not at all
sure about the differences b/t MIG and TIG welding procedures, but
just by eyeballing the crack, it looks like a nasty, difficult task
to just to get at the fissure, let alone WELD it with all those 
components near it.  Has anyone else experienced something like this?
I still can't understand why the firewall would fatigue like this...
afterall the clutch is hydraulically actuated rather than having a
the tension of a clutch cable pull at it...?  Comments welcomed! Thanks

As far as I can tell, the number you gave is the crankcase part number. 
If you look on the vertical surface of the fan-housing support, you'll

If it ain't a '70 or '71, it ain't an original 914/6.

On the other hand, a '73 conversion is a much nicer car (as long as you 
don't care whether it's "factory").  The '73s had a MUCH better 
sideshift transmission, a movable passenger seat, and numerous other 
niceties that were missing from the early 914s.

Also, if it's a conversion, it's likely to have a larger, more powerful, 
and (probably) more reliable engine.  The original 914/6s came with 
2-liter engines that developed only 110 horsepower.  For comparison, my 
car (a 1973 914/6 conversion) has a 2.7-liter Euro Carrera RS motor with 
about 260 horsepower... A big difference.  With the Carrera chain 
tensioners, oil-squirters, turbo valve covers, 930 oil pump, etc., it's 
a lot more reliable than the original 914/6 engines.

Before your friend buys this car, he should definitely consult with 
someone who knows 914s.  Your local Porsche Club of America region would 
be a good place to find such a person.

	If front-end expense is a problem, you can mount 911 brakes

Mark:

The Fuchs alloys do indeed have part numbers on them.  Since I'm too 
lazy to go downstairs and check the numbers on my wheels, I'll just 
suggest that you call Robert W. Wood, Inc. at 310 473-6649 and ask them.

The forged wheels have a very smooth finish; most cast replicas are 
rougher, although if you don't have access to a set of real wheels for 
comparison, this may not be useful information.

Also, if the wheels are being advertised as 7's and 8's, they're 
almost certainly 6's and 7's... Get the numbers from Robert Wood to be 
sure.

Mike, based on my experience, I guess you could clean up the intake valves
after you remove the intake manifold. If I remember correctly, you can actually
see them. Two questions come to mind:

1st, I don't know if you can get to the
back of the valves. I remember seeing one part of them, but how will you rotate
them to get to the other side?

2nd, how to ensure that you remove all of the crap out? Vacuum it out?  Is the
stuff hard enough to damage the cylinder walls?

I openend my engine a few months ago, and much to my surprise, there were no
deposits on either the intake or exhaust valves. My car had 93K miles at the
time. I was impressed. 

Why not try some Techron in your car? Also, have you looked for any vacuum 
leaks and or leaking injector seals? The seals are easy to change and the
kits are about $4 from Porsche.

Very sorry to hear about the Bridge, it really is a great place to exercise
your Porsche. I echo the sentiments that if you haven't done it yet you
really should.
It has great elevation changes as well as some REALLY high speed turns. It is
also a technical course so a real l rythym can happen. Not to mention that it
is in a very pretty area.
It is high up on a hill at the end of Long Island so there is water on 3

One caveat is that the surface is poor, at this point, and the sand can do a
number on your car. My car wears its Bridgehampton blemishes proudly.

You're right, it is a tight spot, but with the proper precautions, your
experienced welder should be able to strengthen it.

I have seen another 944 with this particular symptom, probably caused by
some sort of accident or abuse.

Keep in mind that using the clutch pedal does stress the clutch master
cylinder (at the mounting points to the firewall) in the same direction
every time you use it. A bit of fatigue might be expected...

If you have NO key, pragmatically, your only alternative will be to buy

I got only one factory alarm key with my '85.  I inquired as high as PNA

Actually, I'm about to buy a '90 C2 Cab in the next few weeks and having
read that the '90 C2's have a couple of potential problem areas that
are mucho expensive to repair:

             $2k - clutch 
			 $8k - cylinder head oil leaks
			 
Let's just say that I'm a wee bit concerned.

It seems to me that these are design flaws that PCNA should make good
on. I can see why a major recall wasn't done, due to the fact that
not all '90 C2's exibit these problems, so why spend the major $$$?

My GREATEST fear in buying a '90 C2 is that my car will have these
problems and PCNA will say, "Sorry, you are not the original owner, so
there's nothing we can do", thus leaving me SOL with a car that
leaks oil and has clutch problems, cause after dishing out $40k for
the car, I sure can't (and won't) come up with another $10k to fix
problems that could not have been prevented, except by a different
design.

I've resigned myself to buying a C2 from an authorized Porsche dealer,
paying the extra bucks for a warranty and insisting that they fix
these particular problems or have them agree to fix them IF they
develop in the future. (I'm really sure they'll agree to that!  NOT!)

Bottom line: I'm buying a '90/'91 C2 Cab, come hell or high water!

ABS gets its primary inputs from wheel motion sensors right next to the 
brake rotors (advanced ABS systems may get other inputs, but wheel 
movement is the key ingredient).  Software interpretation of relative 
wheel motion is how ABS systems decide when to reduce pressure to a 
brake channel.  All of this is derived from actual sensor input, not 
any "guess".

However, there are some design variables that affect ABS decisions.  
One such variable would include the threshold at which the ABS 
considers the tire to be skidding versus just having a high slip angle, 
or turning at a different speed going around a tight bend.  These 
legitimate wheel speed differences must not trigger the ABS.  Also, 
different tire compounds (stickiness really) come into play here too, 
especially if a different compound or size (read: total effective 
braking energy throught the tire/road interface during braking) is used 
on the front vs. back axle.

ABS considers all the above things (and possibly more), and adjusts 
brake line pressure in either 2 channels (cheap), 3 (most common - both 
rears on 1 circuit), or 4 (most expensive, most rare) channels.  It 
does this is dozens of times per second.  These 2 major abilities 
(reaction speed and individual channel control) are something no human 
can do, which is why a well-tuned ABS system will *always* beat any 
human's relatively slow, single-channel braking abilities.  This is 
most acutely obvious under bumpy braking, or when 1/2 the car is on 
sand/grass/etc. and the other half's on asphalt.

All that said, there's no requirement that every car manufacturer use 
the best ABS system on their cars, so...  "Your mileage may vary"

In contrast to the above, in loose surfaces like deep snow, sand, or 
gravel, you'll actually stop faster by locking the wheels, letting them 
dig-in and build a berm in front of themselves.  In this situation ABS 
actually impedes deceleration not because of any technological problem, 
but because its whole design principle is not correct in that braking 
situation.  But when you consider what percent of time you'll be doing 
emergency braking in these conditions vs. "regular" hard-packed roads, 
you'll see that overall, ABS is a *big* win.

I too saw this accident on ESPN several times, in slow-mo (I taped it). 
 That guy who hit the wall pulled a really stupid racing move with 
typical consequences.  I couldn't understand why he didn't brake before 
hitting the barrier and causing huge rear-end damage.  But it's 
possible, as you suggest, that the ABS system went wacky and he lost 
braking power while in reverse.  I've heard incidental reports of 
exactly this on 2 occasions, once from a [now forgotten name] 
professional racer who ran Lime Rock backwards in a 928.  He completed 
the lap in something around 1:30, then tried to stop but couldn't, and 
lightly tapped a guardrail.  I heard directly from him, that he had no 
brakes whatsoever at the end of his run.

This was several years ago, on an earlier generation of Bosch ABS than 
is now used by Porsche.

I've also heard reports that Carrera Cup racers a couple years ago 
wanted their ABS disabled.  They accomplished this by whacking a few 
curbs really hard as the race started; this upset the wheel sensors 
and/or ABS brain, so it self-shutdown, leaving 'regular" braking intact.

It really depends on what type you get.  There was a company out there making

with those.  They are made from aluminum and are laser die-cut.  Once

If you look at the old classic race cars from the 50's and 60's you'll see

Well, if any PCA regions go asking people to disable their ABS then 
that region, it's directors, and national PCA will have a *huge*

Gee, our instructors are much more experienced than yours in 
controlling backwards spins...  :-)

I feel that our teaching should continue with only _slight_ 
modification, since the physics of vehicles in motion remains the same 
with or w/o ABS.  We do need to add a section on ABS brake systems, how 
they operate, and how to use them effectively.

By way of background, I'm a PCA instructor, previously region track

    possible, as you suggest, that the ABS system went wacky and he lost 
    braking power while in reverse.  I've heard incidental reports of 
    exactly this on 2 occasions, once from a [now forgotten name] 
    professional racer who ran Lime Rock backwards in a 928.  He completed 
    the lap in something around 1:30, then tried to stop but couldn't, and 
    lightly tapped a guardrail.  I heard directly from him, that he had no 
    brakes whatsoever at the end of his run.

Anyone have any idea why ABS wouldn't function in reverse?  I would think that
the sensors would just count pulses as some specially-marked section(s) of the
wheel rotated past, and these would be counted no matter the direction of the
rotation.   Hmmm, unless there were two staggered sensors, such that one 
expected to trigger a microsecond after the other, hmmmm.....

Anyone with a *real* clue?

Just a quick idea, for those of you, who like me, seem to spend to much time
and $ reading and responding to mail through America On Line.

If you have not discovered the FlashSession feature(I just did), look into it.
  By using it, you only stay connected long enough to pick-up and drop off
files (at 14.4 less than 5 min a day)

To use:
Under MAIL select FlashSessions... Pick the "Walk me through it" option (You
need to at least configure it to Pick-up and Send mail)  Again under MAIL
select Activate FlashSession Now.  After it is set up the first time, it
dials into AOL, drops off any mail you have created off-line (under MAIL,
select COMPOSE MAIL without connection to AOL to create off-line) and picks
up all your new mail, then logs off.  You can then take all the time in the
world to browse through your mail (using the Read Incoming Mail option under
MAIL) without burning through money better spent on the important things,
like your car.

Hope this helps,

Dear John,

The year and engine size of your 914 matters! We assume that it is still
fuel-injected. Two things:

1. The backfire and "gutteral" sound could be the 1.8 Air Flow Meter flap
sticking and loading the engine.
2. 90 lbs compression is not good!
3. Usually lack of power is because the engine is running on less than four
cylinders. While the engine is idling, pull one spark plug wire at a time
from the distributor cap. This will localize the cylinder.

After hearing all that talk recently about Gas Analysers I couldn't resist

step me through the proper process (start to stop) for tunning Weber40IDA's on
a healthy1974 2.7L engine. I have had several reputable shops  provide me with
conflicting information.  I don't know the age of the carbs and hence intend
to remove them from the car for cleaning and gasket replacement. What else
should I check for while they are on the bench?  What alignments should I
perform.   How do I best determine what jet sizes to use .    I live in
Toronto...cant remember the latitude but we are about 500' above sea level.
  Im tired of hearing the shops tell me leave it to an expert (i.e.
them)....Im sure that if I can rebuild my engine successfully I can learn how
to properly tune my carbs...I hate having someone else touch my engine ( well
unless its the wife).  Any help would be greatly appreciated....especially the
part where I get to try out my new analyzer.

My '86 928 has a radio antenna embedded in the windshield, and has a black wire

wire to 12V allowed my Blaupunkt, which otherwise worked fine, to also receive

Hello, Babak,

The two relays that you see in the rear quarter are identical. If you 
swap them, and the symptom changes, then you might suspect that one of the
two is bad. Final determination of which one is bad is left as an exercise...

There is another relay located in the fuse block. It can be identified by
the raised letters spelling "Hedebach".

On the other hand, the symptom that you describe (motor whir, no roof
movement) tells me that you more likely have a drive problem. I would start 
by checking that the gear on the motor is not broken or that the retainer
clip has not allowed the gear on the motor to come loose.  

Most likely, you only have one problem which is causing the several
different symptoms...

good luck,

Do you mean ABS 5?  If so, the "5" just means fifth generation, not 5 
channel.  Unless there's a new jargon out there, the word "channel" 
means a braking circuit that the ABS controls.

ABS wheel control is always equal in the front/rear sense, i.e. you'd 
never find diagonal ABS, though you can find diagonal hydraulic lines 
(sorry if this isn't clear).  So the valid combinations of ABS channel 
control are:

Channels	Wheels controlled
- --------	-----------------
1		Rear axle (pickup trucks, etc.)
2		Front axle, rear axle
3		Front left, front right, rear axle
4		Each wheel individually controlled (ideal but most expensive)

I forgot to mention 1 channel systems in my last posting.

So in a perfect system, a car with 4 individually controllable brake 
calipers could have at most, 4 channels.  The fifth channel, if there 
is even such a thing, likely just twits the driver's head via hydraulic 
action, as if to say "Come on dummy, watch it!".

$5500 for a serial number seems high, because that's what you're buying.
$2000 is about right for a parts coupe with a salvageable engine and trans

Unless you have lots of time and/or money, run away. This thing will be a

floor and longitudinals are gone, you need somebody who knows what they're
doing to put those in, or you're going to get a car that looks like somebody
put a floor and longitudinals in it.
 
Also consider all the time you're going to have to spend to find all the

First option: Beg, beg, beg for a Momo steering wheel for your birthday.

If that doesn't work, whatever you don't, do NOT let yourself come into 
contact with one.
At the IMSA race at Watkins Glen last year, I made the mistake of going to 
the Momo display (in the paddock only, not open to the unwashed masses 
who don't buy paddock passes), and laying my hands upon a Momo Corse 
wheel, and I fell in love. To make a long story short, I now have a Corse 
wheel awaiting installation upon my 914 when spring breaks. (Black 
leather, red stitching to match the TRW Sabelt harnesses... Oo! Oo! Oo!) 
EXTREMELY nice.
And, for what it's worth, you can get one for less than you might think - 
some places in European Car, etc, sell the cheapie Momo wheel, the Monte 
Carlo, for only $130 or so, plus another... $50? maybe less for the mounting 
kit. It's worth it.

I never bothered trying to fix the non-functional horn in my 914 last 
summer, using that as an incentive to buy a new wheel. ("I'll fix it when I 
put the new wheel on!") Now I have to take the Fiamm air horns out of my 
Shelby... (With trumpets off an old Ferrari Dino... Ahhh! Beautiful noise.)

If you're really tight on a budget, perhaps you might want to look around the 
swap shows for a decent, grippy aftermarket Beetle steering wheel... I'm 
90% sure they are compatable. (Anyone know for sure?)

Subject: 914/6 Engine to 2.2E specs


I am rebuilding my "real" 914/6 motor to 2.2E specs.  I have some good "E"
cams, but since they were on a mechanically injected motor, the cam on the
right side (in a 914/6) is longer and requires some sort of seal on the cam
tower on that end.  The cam tower I have is tapped on the correct end. 

What I need is the retainer or bracket for capturing the seal required on that
end of the cam.  I haven't yet called the dealer since they probably want too
much.  Is anyone out there have a 69-73 motor in parts that has this piece and
would be willing to part with it for a modest sum?  I am in the Bay area.

I removed the screw once to raise the roof manually so I could remove it. 
When I put the screw back, I found that the motor whirled without moving
the roof. After much frustration and even removing the motor (made in US I
believe) I finally discovered that it was very critical how you tightened
the screw. After making sure the screw was very tight and secure, the roof
worked again. 

My only problem now is that SOMETIMES, the motor will keep whirling even 
when then roof is fully raised (when the switch is depressed). The motor 
always shuts off properly when the roof is lowered. How can this be adjusted?

Thanks for your message.

You're right, the standard factory gauge lighting is pretty bad.  It's not
Porshe's main fault as VDO makes the instruments, but the buck stops with the
manufacturer for OKing it.

To get an idea if the white gauges are easier to read at night compared with
the black ones:  Shut the lights off in a room so there is very little
illumination, then try to read a white paper with black lettering and a
 black paper with white lettering.  See the difference?

Subject: Roll Cages, Car Value, ...

I have a reasonable low milage (35K) 89 944 S2, that is in pretty good
condition. I would like to start autocrossing it and also be able to get
some driving time on a track (drivers schools, time trials, ...), but
haven't done either before.

I assume that PCA requires roll cages for track events. What other safety
equipement is required (besides a helmet)? How does installing a roll cage
effect the resale value of the car?  Does a it affect the available head
room? Can the cage be removed without marring the appearance of the car? Is
there much sheet metal work when installing a roll cage, and do you have to
be careful so that you don't provide a spot for rust to develop?

Would I be better off getting an older car for track stuff, and use my
current car only for personal use or autocrossing?

                                        Thanks for any opinions,

                                                Chuck

P.S. I assume that my initial practicing would best be done in
autocrossing, and then I can work my way up to track events.

I put a Wheelskin leather steering wheel cover on my 914's steering wheel. 
But before I did, I lined the inside of the Wheelskin with 1/16" thick
dense black neoprene-like foam, with an adhesive backing. The result is
really very nice - not quite like a Momo wheel (like the one on my wife's
car), but still nice and grippy.  And cheap - $30 or so, plus a couple
hours in front of the TV or something while doing the near-mindless lacing.

I am in the slow process of reassembling my '74 914 after having spent several
months in the rustoration shop.  This is my first "project" car so out of
curiousity I dissassemble everything, clean it, and reassemble it.

My question is:
Is there anything special I have to do to bleed the master brake cylinder when
reinstalling it (Yes, I took it apart, cleaned the inside, and checked all
the rubber seals).

I have bled my brakes before with no problems, but several times I have noticed
people referencing an extra step required if you have drained your master
brake cylinder.  Or is this only for power brakes?

I am planning on keeping the car stock so no I don't want to upgrade to a 911
master cylinder.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

For autocrossing you do not need a roll bar(cage). For time trials in

"stock" class. For time trial you will need five point belts in both

Like any other "racing" you need to get a set of the rules for where and

Hi Nate. You asked:

I got my foam ages ago - I think it was from the local "House of Foam"
(Yes, it exists, it's on Hamilton Ave in Palo Alto).  Note: if you choose
to use foam under the Wheelskin, _make sure you use only one piece_.  If
you use more than one piece (i.e. there's a butt joint between two pieces
of foam), it's bound to show up as a "valley" on the surface of the
wheelskin.

I ordered the standard one for the 914 (either from Zim's or GPR), and with
(or without) the foam it's a very snug slipover fit, but it works.
Wheelskins is at 800-755-2128 and they are very helpful. I think their
proposed method of lacing is poor, though, and you should experiment with
some better ones. Some pfile addressed this at length a while back.

HTH,

The problem with my brother's 914 has evidently been solved - his last
email follows. Thanks for the various suggestions. What I want to know
is, where do you get mufflers that last 24.5 years?

- ----

A few more clues.  When I removed the sparkplugs in order to check the 
compression (I had cleaned them earlier) they were sooty black.  Seems the 
mixture was much too rich.  It occurred to me that maybe there was some 
obstruction to intake air flow in the oil bath  air cleaner, so I took the 
aircleaner off and tried the car again.  No improvement in power but the 
low, gutteral engine note was much louder.  When I put my ear near the 
intake and revved the engine it sounded almost like an exhaust note.
On the basis of the informatin you sent yesterday I disconnected the hose 
from the intake manifold to the pressure sensor and sucked on it (nice clean 
tubeing,  I'd replaced it the day before).  It seemed to hold a vacuum fine. 
 When I started the engine it ran much worse than yesterday.  It wouldn't 
idle and would hardly rev at all.  So I took off the muffler.  Voila! 
Instant power.  Problem solved.  That lettle backfire must have been 
something letting loose in the  25 year old muffler.  In the 914 all of the 
exhaust is eventually channeled into a single approx 24 inch long fairly 
small pipe.  Something, a baffle or ? must have broken loose with near 
complete obstruction of the entire exhaust.  I guess the loud noise from the 
intake was exhaust coming out the intake valves.  Wierd.  I banged on the 
muffler but nothing fell out or rattled around.  Boy is it loud.

In the process of securing a street title for my HD XR-750TT, I got into a
fairly interesting discussion with a man who claims to have done the
- --legal-- documentation for 4 959's. He claims that these are the only 959's
that are street legal and has the mountains of legal work to prove it. He
also said that in the next few months, we would see magazine articles about
the cars and one is currently offered for a princely $2 million. We agreed
that a used 956 or 962, at less than a tenth of that, is a much better value
and that the current owner was out of his mind asking that much. Supposedly
Jerry Seinfeld was interested but was balking at the price. 
Now I don't know if this is true, but I didn't want the facts to get in the
way of a good story.

A friend of mine just bought a 77 911S, polar blue/black, leather interior,
sunroof, etc. for $7750 here in Southern California. It needed a clutch cable
and minor tuning, but he looked at several in the $7500-10000 price range.
Granted, it's not a Carrera 3.0, but it's not twice the price, either.

Thanks everyone for your help on pricing an *immaculate* 1985  911 Targa in
Canada. 

While it appears that $30M is too much in the states, it's fairly good for
here in the Great White North, when you factor-in exchange rates and market
differences. 

The mechanic will check it on Friday morning and if it meets
expectations,I'll be on the road immediately thereafter!

I'm not sure how interesting this will be to anyone, but ...

Automotive News had a chart comparing sales in the first two months of '95
with the first two months of '94.  Porsche sales are up 119%.  Across the
industry, U.S. car and light truck sales are down 3.1%  With this surge in
sales volume, our beloved marque has captured one-tenth of one percent of the
United States automobile market share (not counting light trucks).

Subject: 914 brakes and ABS


The 914 brake system has a proportioning valve located on the lower firewall
(below the engine sheetmetal) accessable from the bottom of the car on the
driver's side. Historically, this little gem has been known to trap a large 
amount of air. If you are replacing a master cylinder or any  rear brake 
hoses or the calipers, you must bleed the proportioning valve also.

This is accomplished by first bleeding all the calipers and getting pedal. 
Then you must (as the valve has no bleeder) break the connecting nuts on the 
lines to bleed the valve. First do the line leaving the valve, then the input 
line. I highly recommend this be done MANUALLY to get enough pressure to make 
the valve move. 

If you are having problems with the rear brakes working correctly, the 914/4
rear calipers MUST BE manually adjusted to have about .008" (.2mm) clearance
between the brake pad and the rotor. The hex adjustment bolts are under a 
plastic cap for the outer pad and a special hex cap for the inner, accessable 
through the trailing arm. This information is available in the old Clymer's
914 manual which is being reprinted by another firm.


ABS. Not all systems are equal, even with the Bosch systems. The issue is 
the sampling rate of the computer. The Porsche unit will work fine in almost
all conditions. It is possible to brake at a rate hard enough cause the 
airbag to deploy. This has occured on the track, probably the reason the early
944 Escort cars didn't have them (Yeah, they add a lot of weight, too). I have
abused a system or two and have found no ill effects or defects when using
all of the brakes. The ABS made virtually no difference in the handling
and did make the car (a 928) feel much more stable in some corners where the 
weight transfer made things dicey.

Most of us aren't able to get the extra tenth (the eleventh? per G. Hill) out
of our driving so we will never be able to subjectively tell the difference.
Pete Albrecht does enough testing of cars to know the difference, I'd trust 
his opinion on the subject.

Why ABS? ABS is an easy way to mask the problems associated with excessive 
weight transfer of a front engined car. ESPECIALLY front wheel drive cars. 
The weight bias is near 60% on many US and Japanese cars with FWD. This makes 
the rears virtually useless when nailing the brakes hard. Couple this with
icy or inclimate weather and you have some big lawsuits on the horizon. The
added benefit of the ABS electronics is the so-called traction control 
feature. FWD cars have a big problem putting more than 225 HP through the 
front wheels. The traction control feature allows the manufacturers to put more
horsepower in and then tailor a curve to prevent Joe Average from exceeding 
the performance envelope, maybe damaging himself in the process. 

Ralph Nader and his minions are still alive and insideously foisting 
electronic monitoring into motor vehicles. ABS really works, a torson 
differential provides better traction control at a far lower price (when 
installed on the production line).

    Oh shit.  Looks like I'm in a world o'hurt (tm)... the rear brakes
on my 914 are completely nonfunctional (as in, I took my car for a spin
and the fronts were hot and the rears were still rusty...) but I just
assumed that it was because the master cyl. since it was spewing brake
fluind all over the pedal assembly.... so I procured meself a new master
cyl. which I will be installing over spring break.
    What else am I gonna have to do?
    Will it hurt?
    Will it cost money (even worse)?

	There's a 959 in the Deutches Museum in Muenchen.  Actually,
it's the drivetrain and suspension from a 959 (including motor)
mounted up sideways on the wall, close enough to touch (!!!).  I
probably shot an entire roll of film just getting all the little
details.  Included, of course, was the requisite picture of me
standing in front of the thing so I could prove to my car-nut buddies
I had really seen a "live" 959.

WOW! I did not know that. My dream is to buy two and have one crash tested.
But my theory is a bit different. I new it would not pass the test right
out of the factory. With that much money and smarts you think he would have
taken it to RUF and had them work the two over. Designed into it -- 5mph
bumbers, saftey glass, additional features for american road use. After
that I would bet you it would have passed the test. It would cost a bunch,
but hey it would be worth it to me if I had the money.

If you find that there's something "hanging" with me, in particular if

I haven't seen the ad... Was it a 959 or one of the new 911's.  They look
almost the same from a front end shot. Those carpet ads that use a 911
throw me every time. I think the car is a 959 at first.

If it was a 959 I would almost bet it was a replica. I know he is an advid
Porsche fan. A real nice replica is better than none at all. One 959 rep. I
saw was in the long beach area. I had to look twice. Eveything was perfect,
just like I remembered from the factory when I visited. The final clue to
me was the stearing wheel. No 959 logo. And it was missing the important
dials on the console. Underneath is also a giveaway. I can tell a 911 turbo
from the bottom anytime. But the rest of this car was spactacular. Not one
flaw.

I don't think I have ever seem or heard of a "Original" 959 anywhere free
roaming America. Though now that I remember it There was an add for a 959
for sale from Santa Fe New Mexico, Very close to where I live. Never seen
it though. There are a lot of movie stars that have places there. Robert
Reddford owns a place and drives a 911 turbo convertable. Midnight blue.
When I saw it in a parking lot near a studio he was in I noticed that the
guy did not even lock it.

So who's to tell what is hidden in those mountains near Santa Fe.

to a software (prom) change/upgrade for the DME. The HP gain was attributed
to the assumption that Super unleaded gas was being used. 

Looking at some 911 performance catalogs I noticed that all of the companies 
list different chips for software "upgrades" for those model years. I would 
assume that if the DME electronics were the same and only the software was 
different then there would be only one common part number for the software 
upgrades. Most company would perfer to stock only one part if they were 
compatible and an had equal level of performance. Since this isn't the case 
I'm not convinced that the software was the only difference.

Has anyone tried to simply "plug in" a later mode carrera's prom into the
earlier 911's DME? Have they noticed any horse power gains?

If anyone could shed some light on this subject please let me know.

Thanks.

    Oh dear... looks like I'm in for a world o' hurt(tm) - the rear
brakes on my 914 are totally nonfunctional... (as in when I took it out
for a spin the fronts were hot and the rears were still rusty...)  I
assumed this was because the master cyl. was leaking copiously
everywhere..  I ave, of course, rebuilt a different master cyl. that I
plan on installing over psring break but this makes me think that I may
have yet more problems... What should I do/look for other than simply
installing the master cyl. and bleeding the brakes?

Subject: Track Driving Question

Hello Fellow Track Drivers:

I am getting prepared to drive at the Connecticut Valley Region Driver Ed even
t at Lime Rock Park on 4/14. I was re-reading parts of the Watt's (Let's not
start another 'who's Henry Watts' thing) book, and I have a question about
one of his statements.

In one part of the book he says that on a race track you should either be on
the throttle hard, or on the brake hard. How are you supposed to do that in
Big Bend at Lime Rock, or the hairpin at Bridgehampton, or other relatively
long, tight turns? In my car (86 844, normally aspirated), after getting the
braking done for Big Bend, and starting the turn in (with a little trail braki
ng), when I start to accelerate, if I accelerate hard, I run out of track
before the esses. Instead of heavy throttle coming out of big bend, I have to
modulate the throttle, and I can only put it down about 1/2 way out of the
turn. What should I be doing? Should I brake longer before accelerating? Not
accelerate as hard? Would a car that was more set up for the track, as far as
tires, springs, shocks, brakes, etc, be more "on throttle, or on brakes" than
my completely stock car?. 

Thanks for your advice

Rish,

I bought an 84 Targa last summer (with 51k miles on it) (with the 
substantial help of this collective group of experts).  Problems I had to 
resolve included a seeping left cam tower line (no big deal); a burned 
out a/c switch (still not fixed because I prefer the top off which is why 
I bought a Targa to begin with); a burned out antenna motor (my next 
posting to the list - for help in acquiring and replacing this); and a 
top that is beginning to show its age and useage (tears forming along the 
folds).  I did have a leak in heavy rain (with the car parked) aound the 
drivers side window (top of the "fin" window) but I assume when I have the 
top redone this will disappear.  The car is great fun.  I know the clutch 
had just been replaced 1000 miles before my purchase so you might want to 
look at that. 

glad to see so many folks on the list with the 84 Carreras!

Good luck.  Be careful and have a good pre-ourchase inspection done - 
it's well worth the money.

It will be twice the price, once he repairs it or does the preventative
maintenance.  The 77 911S is the least reliable 911 ever built.
But just about everyone know 'bout them seals, that mag case, thermal
reactor, stressed engine, oil leaks, pulled head studs, etc.

Then again, maybe he bought one that was rebuilt right...

Jim (or Charles),
Hard to believe it has no rust.  Restored perhaps?  Nice year (short
wheelbase, tho).  Based on advertisements out here (bay area) I'd
guess a nice example would go for $13k.  A real ratty one would go
for $6k, and a concourse car for $20k.  Pretty wild prices.
Condition is really the determining factor.  Did I see a Connecticut
mail address?  A 67 911 with 100k miles in New England with a
solid pan, rockers, taillight boxes and wheelwells?  Wow.  Sounds
*very* nice.

Sounds like you're going fast enough to experience the dreaded understeer of
a stock 944.  What you're going to have to do is ask your instructor how to
get your car to turn in a bit better at the second part of Big Bend, so that
you can hit the apex properly. (Hint: you have to transfer the weight of the
car to the front wheels a bit, typically by throttle management or a bit of
left foot braking while staying on the gas...)

>Should I brake longer before accelerating? 

Probably not. Big Bend requires that you have the car stable during the
turnin. What works for me is getting the car slowed down from the straight,
starting the turnin, then accelerating to the second turnin, braking (I
know, the 911 guys say you can't do that in the middle of a turn) and then
balancing the car through the second part of Big Bend, lifting for a split
second to make the apex, then full acceleration into the braking area for
the left-hander in the esses.

> Not accelerate as hard? 

In a 944, the key is maintaining as much momentum as you can. Inasmuch as
the power is limited, you have to accelerate as hard as you can, as long as
you can, and as often as you can.

> Would a car that was more set up for the track, as far as

You'll have to ask one of the racers that question. Perhaps some of the ITS
racers in the audience... (Nathan, Kevin???)  I will say, though, that if
you want to be faster, you're going to have to upgrade your brakes from
stock and invest in some good race rubber.

I'd bump these numbers a couple of grand each.  This is a very rare beastie,
both an S model, and a soft window'd targa.

IFF the paint is nice and the interior is not ratty, AND the heater works,
AND there are no tranny or engine problems;  This car could be worth $17-25K.

If it needs some work, take the rough price of the work needed to be done,
multiply it by 1.2 and subtract that from $17500.

IE: needs new paint ($5000*1.2==$6000) -> $11,500
  & needs new synchros 1st & 2nd ($1300*1.2==$1560) -> 9940
  & needs new interior ($800*1.2==$9600 -> $8980

     Except for, oh, a Ferrari F-40 or something....I'd have a hard time
  thinking a US legal 959 could fetch $2 million when the F40s are selling
  for as little as $225k used. Rant and rave about whose best, but the
  F40 has sold over 800 copies. Porsche could have made a killing in
  the late 80's if they'd federalized the 959. Ferrari is all grins over the
  money they made on the F40....

     My 2 brushes with 959s in the US are;
    1. Seeing one from afar in the Houston Ferrari dealership showroom.
       Those rich folks who get 330P3s, Barchettas and the like need
       somewhere to show them off, the Ferrari dealer usually has something
       on display only. That 959 was surely on temporary visa to the US....

    2. I met Arnold, the guy who designed the Getty 959 copy. He was best
       man at Mike H's wedding. Mike drove away in his 3.2l twin plug,
       webered, GE-80'd and Lockheed-stopped 914 Chalon. I always cry at

I have a very nice 68 912 Targa and follow the soft back market.  this one 
sounds interesting.  My best guess would be 12-16K in good driveable 
unrestored condition.  Remember,you caould easily spend another 15K to restore 
it for paint, interior, mechanicals and then you'd have a nice 18K car.

Stan,

I read your warning on stainless braided brake lines with great interest.
 Since these lines are used in aircraft, and now are standard in the
refrigeration industry, are we getting inferior quality?  The lines used in
refrigeration must withstand significant vibration, heat, dirt, and pressure
in excess of 200 psi, 24 hours a day for at least 10 years.  Is automotive
use more severe than this?  From your warning, I take it that we should
replace our brake lines every year.  Better still to not use them?  What
about the seldom used Street/Track car?  Thanks for any more information you

Kevin,

They do make "ez-out" drills that you can use to unscrew the broken nipple.
 You have to drill a small hole in the fitting, and then the ez-out has a
reverse flute that will grab the inside of the hole and back out the fitting.
 If that doesn't work, you will have to carefully drill out the fitting.  Use
increasing size drill bits to drill down the center of the fitting, past the
threads.  BE CAREFULL NOT TO DRILL INTO WHERE THE FITTING SEATS IN THE
CALIPER. Eventually, you will get to the thread diameter, and then you can
pick out the rest of the fitting with a dentist's pick. GOOD LUCK!

Barry,

     I have to agree with what George says, and I wanted to add a few
comments of my own. I have found that any car not setup with terminal
oversteer, 911's included, can be balanced on the brakes.  The line that I
preferred to use in Big Bend was to brake and turn-in early at the first
apex, and accelerate at full throttle across the track towards the outside
edge.  Then brake again while turning the car into the second apex.  As soon
as the car turns in (and before the rear gets loose) feed in full throttle
and accelerate across the second apex up to the left hander.  Brake hard,
turn-in and feed in full throttle through the right hander and down no-name
straight!  This technique worked in both my 914 and my 911.  I set several
track records there during Time Trials in the late 80's and early 90's. Trust
me, it works.  I also found that if you trail brake way into the hairpin at
Bridgehampton, you can get the rear to start to drift, and then give it full
power all the way around.

     As far as having a setup car better able to handle full throttle, the
answer is YES.  If your car is adjusted to be fairly neutral, then it can be
driven "flat out" in most turns.  By this I mean, brake up to the turn (and
maybe into it *trail brake*), turn-in while lifting off of the brakes, and as
soon as the rear of your car starts to get "nervous", plant the tail by
feeding in full throttle, and shoot past the apex, out to the trackout point,
and down the next straightaway.  If you can't do this on 90% of the turns,
either your car has too much understeer, has unbelievable horsepower (350+),
or you are apexing way too early!  What a stiffer suspension will do is to
make the transition (weight shift) from braking to throttle happen much
faster, and it will also make the car much quicker on side to side
transitions.  Finally, a stiffer suspension will keep the tires planted better
, and reduce unwanted camber change to help improve the overall grip of your
car.  Hope that helped!

There is no retainer for the seal. It simply is driven into place and is

I've seen people simply cut off the drive end of the cam. You don't need it

The 959 is interesting and rare and all that, but I suspect the price will
be coming down somewhat from the (claimed) 2 million. OK, so you get snob
appeal, but Porsche introduced a better car just this past Tuesday -- the
new Turbo. 405 horsepower, sequential twin turbocharging, all wheel drive,
(sound familiar?), plus the more modern, more capable suspension of the 993,
and priced I think a bit above 100K. And US legal. It would be interesting to
see which is faster on the track, but I would place my bets on the new Turbo
and not on the 8 or 10 year old design. Tuners are probably already planning
3.8 liter versions etc. I would like to see what Alois Ruf can do with this

there wider tires in the 16 inch size?

If I switched to the newer 17 inch rims for the newer turbos, will they fit

I experienced the same symptoms you describe and after swapping relays and

Gears cost around $7 at a dealer and easy to replace, I'll dig up the

Another 959 story:

About six years ago, I was having my 912 aligned at the famous-but-now-closed Garretson's in
Mountain View, California.  Since I was a newbie and wanted to learn, I had struck a deal with
friend/mechanic Gordon Ledbetter,  who agreed to stay late to let me watch and help.   

Way in the back of the shop, on the last hydraulic lift, next to Gordon's 935 project engine, was a 
*gasp* REAL 959!!   Needless to say, I was astonished.  Gordon was very low-key about it, as was
everybody else in the shop, including Jerry Woods, who was servicing the silver jewel.  Seems that
they were trying to avoid attracting attention to it.  Gordon explained that it was a quasi-legal import
that had been brought into the States before the EPA/DOT embargo.  Although they wouldn't
identify the owner, I later heard speculation from some PCA folks that it may have belonged to a
Hewlett or a Packard.  

I got a good close look at it, and it had evidence of being driven hard:  road grit on the
undercarriage, significant tire wear, etc.  It was explained to me that Jerry Woods was one of the
only people in the Bay Area "qualified" to service the beast, having experience working on 956 /
962's.  I was gushing about what it must be like to drive such a car,  when Gordon calmly
interjected "Oh, it drives OK".  Turns out that they had all taken turns test-driving the car! 
Unfortunately, no offers to drive the car were extended to me.  Sigh.

If any Bay-Area porschephiles can add details to this story, please feel free.

Subject: Broken cruise control 

Someone recently requested info on a cruise control problem which caused it
to stick in the full throttle or "Cruise Missle Mode". I had the same problem
with my' 87 Carerra and would like to offer my $.02. The first time it
happened to me I was heading up the New Jersey turnpike on the way to my
first track event. Traffic was thick and annoying so I decided to use the
cruise control and go with the flow. Imagine my surprise when upon activation
my car took off in dense traffic under full throttle! What was also a little
spooky was the feeling of the gas pedal being sucked to the floor as if by
some demonic spirit. Fortunately just stepping on the brake deactivates the
cruise mode. Later upon investigation I discovered that the cruise control
system is composed of two parts. The first is a brushed aluminum box slightly
smaller than a VHS videocassette which is mounted under the dash near the
radio with an electrical connector attached to it. The second part of the
system is a cylindrical aluminum unit in the engine compartment which the
throttle line passes thru. In my case just changing the electrical component
in the car's interior solved the problem. I was lucky enough to find one at a
swap meet for $15 whole dollars. A great bargain IMHO, especially since a new
one costs around a couple of hundred$. As always YMMV, I hope that this works
for you.

Steve,
I had no trouble with rubbing in the rear what so ever. My fenders, however
are factory rolled as all the Turbo S models. Some people have reported
rubbing with my setup but it seems to be a function of ride height more than
anything,
My only outing with this arrangement was at Sebring, a track that was new to
me, so my frame of reference as far as stick is concerned is subjective. I
also put some real swaybars (30mm and 22mm) on over the winter so I had to
deal with oversteer. I eliminated that by stiffening the front shocks, since
I have the luxury of them being easily adjustable.
All and all the car hooked up great and inspired confidence. As soon as I get
to a track that I am familiar with I can give you something quantitative.
BFG is coming out with 245 x 40 x 17 tires. I don't know if they are

Subject: RE: 959's....

Shortly after the Porsche announcement on availability of customer cars, I
received a letter from the Porsche AG offering a new 959.  Why I got the
letter I don't know, perhaps as a long time owner,
Christophorus subscriber, or a discussion I'd had in Werks 1 looking at them
after the Frankfurt IAA.  ( I got about the same type followup a few years
before on  the 924 GTR).

As I remember, the letter offered the car in the choice of three colors (Red,
Black, Pearl White) for approximately $449,000 US (variable with exchange
rate) FOB Stuttgart.  It also indicated there was no intent to export the car
and any subsequent use, licensing, and customs fees outside of Germany were
the responsibility of the buyer.  It asked for a $50,000 nonrefundable
deposit with the order.  Further it indicated that delivery times were 12-18
months, but in the interim, the buyer would receive a 1/43 Scale 959 model
"handcrafted by an Italian master-modeler".  It also indicated that if you
wanted the model but did not want the real car, it was available for a mere
$4500, "6 months delivery".

Needless to say, I have neither....

My comments are, that you can't be sanguine about the "alleged" condition of
a candidate Porsche until you've had it thoroughly inspected by a competent
Porsche Mechanic.

I do believe that you answered your own question, Pierre, and you should expect 
to invest about $100-150 per candidate Porsche inspected.  

Perhaps some good Boston 'Phile will contact you directly, and the two (or 
however many) of you can work the details out amongst you.

>From talking to the mechanicn, he claims that only the
intake valves are bent , the valve guides o are ok, but
the valve guide seals will be replaced. 

He couldn't see any extra work he could do for me. Thats
a good sign I suppose . The claim is that most of the stuff one 
might want to have a look at is in the other 75% of teh engine that
is not apart. 

Now I know why I dont do my own engine work :-)
===================================
Paul, having bent a couple of valves myself, I would say that if the car
was running fine before the incident, and was not burning oil, then the
minimun work for him would be to replace the bent valves and replace the seals.

The seals are part of the head gasket kit. 

Some things to check while you have the head out (including the intake manifold)are the idle control valve under the IM. It usually gets gunked.
Also it is impossible to replace the oil cooled seals without removing the
head/exhaust manifold. I don't recall the year of your car. But I know that
some years (86 & 87?) had cooler seal problems.

Finally, do any of your cam seals leak? It is a realtively easy job to do
once you have the engine apart. And you have to take it apart to get to
the valves. How are your belts and rollers and water pump? 

My 944 is almost all apart (head will come out tonight). I had some balance
shaft bearing noises. And guess what? The lower BS cover has one bolt
that will not come out unless you remove the exhaust manifold or EM/head
combination. 

Hope this helps...

Byron and All:
	Thanks for sending me the article on the Comp T/A Tires. Very 
informative.

I have two questions for all:

1. The article talks about "heat cycling" a new tire to settle its compound.
What is the right procedure to follow when breaking in new tires? Is regular
driving (for how long?) and then a rest period of 24hrs considered a heat cycle?

If not, how do you obtain optimal temp for heat cycle to begin?

2. The article also talks about asymmetrical construction (stiffer inner side
wall). Do you know if their street Comp t/as also have this type of 
construction? I just bought a set and I noticed that they require that they be
mounted with a specific side out (directional tread). And maybe stiffer side
wall on the inside?

Thanks!

$150 to $300 depending...   I suggest you have an understanding with the 
shop re the aluminum trim strip that goes in the gasket.  It's easy to bend 
the strip, and once bent, it can be "sort of straightened"  but probably not 
restored to a perfect shape with no waves in it.  Surly a good shop can do 
it w/o bending it, but your average price leader will probably tell you 
"they all come out that way".

If you want to replace the dash, having the windshield out makes it trivial.

Subject: Turn disk rotors?


A data point:  I have original factory front rotors at 137K miles.  Never 
turned.  Replaced pads several times.  No ill effects.  Yes, mine also have 
a peripheral lip - doesn't bother me much - it should be there, the pads 
don't touch that outer most periphery.  Did a track event last summer - 
heavy brake use - no problems.

However, checked rotor thickness recently and they are just now a hair 
thinner than spec [as stamped on rotor] so I do plan to replace them soon.

My brake rotor philosophy has always been if they are wearing evenly [as 
they should] then why have them turned.  As I see it, needless rotor turning 
only shortens their useful life by shaving off even more metal than the pads 
alone would.  Also, what's to keep an unscrupulous dealer from just shaving 
off a wee bit extra so he can sell you new rotors sooner?  I am also quite 
interested in any rotor advice from the list.

Alan,

No, don't waste money turning them.  Have them checked for minimum
thickness and replace if they are too thin.  The min. thickness is
stamped on the rotor hat.  A pronounced lip is a reliable sign that
you are likely approaching minimum thickness.

What did the rebuild on the first gear synchro cost you (or did you do it

synchros done soon.  Also, any suggetions on replacing the antenna?  I 
noticed they sell the Japanese version of the German named original 
antenna for substantially cheaper.  How difficult is it to replace the 
antenna?  Any special tools needed?  Should I replace it with a manual

As I recall, this is the same car that had rusted out cables, floor

As an one who is experienced in the trials, frustrations and dissapointments
of restoration, I agree with Gary.  I am just finishing a real 914/6 that was
too near to the grave to start with, but I persisted.  It was only marginally
justified because it was a 914/6.  Rust is the worst thing to deal with when
restoring a car as it can be so pervasive.  I have owned 914s for over 20 years
and I would not touch a car with major rust again.  I know of too many people
who have been sucked into buying a car because it had a nice paint job.

Take Gary's advice and get a not-rusted 914 with a blown engine or some other
form of body damage.  I regularly see cars like this for $500 to $1000 out here
in the S.F. Bay Area.

I didn't know all 951S came from the factory with rolled fenders.  They must 
have anticipated our desire for wider rubber :).  BTW, I called BFG today and 
they will be making the 245/45ZR17 as OEM for the 1996 Ford Mustang but 
production starts in May and they will not be available until a month or 2 
later.  So, I guess I'll have to stick with 235/45 for now.  Let me know if 
you do try 255s in front.

 FYI, for anyone buying BFG tires soon, BFG's annual rebate 
program starts 4/1 thru 11/30. You need to be a Team T/A member to get a 
rebate of $25 per tire for 17"/18", (I think $10-$15 for 15"/16"), valid even 
when purchased thru the mail-order places.

If they're not warped, that is if they don't pulse
when you apply the brakes.  Don't bother having them
turned.  They don't need it.

The 'professional' brake guys always turn the rotors
when you change the pads (at least most of them do) on
the theory that they want you to leave the shop with
every possible thing perfect, and they don't know if the
brakes pulse or not.  You know why?  They don't ask.

Yes, the ads for this car have already been showing up in the duPont
Registry, an ads-only magazine that's available at major newsstands 
and lists many cars at vastly inflated prices. (even the ads are 
expensive at $500 for a 1/8th page.) 

The full page ad claims this is one of 4 street legal 959s in the US, 
because supposedly US regulations prohibit the federalization of any 
more 959s. (Notice they did not say one of *only* four, perhaps this 
gives them a way out if a lot more real 959 models show up).

Anybody know if it is true that the 959 is now categorized as a car
that *cannot* be federalized ? Or does their sneaky ad language 
really only state that they cannot be federalized *as is*, and that
it certainly could be done with the normal modifications.

Having recently acquired a euro 930, I am constantly wondering about
the idiotic inconsistencies in the import laws. For example, I
cannot figure out why US model Porsches must have red taillight 
lenses. For a while I had the theory that our lawmakers intended to
eliminate any possible confusion about the direction a car is facing
by having all taillight lenses on all cars red colored. But my Toyota 
and my sister's Saab 900 were both bought new here from regular 
dealers and have yellow & red taillights. 

Also, you see so much trash on four wheels with legal inspection 
stickers that I really wonder why a 959 would be blacklisted.

Speaking of which, does anybody know where to get the definitive
answer on what modifications need to be done in order to have a
legal euro import ? I suppose it varies somewhat depending on model
year but I have no idea where to look. Fortunately, I had no trouble
registering the car. I was actually armed with the right paperwork,
but no one cared to ask to see the car or any paperwork besides the
title.

By the way, I am glad to see another Porsche geek interested in

No such thing as a Turbo S Cup car. There is no such thing as a 1989 Turbo S.
 There are Turbo S's and there are Turbo Cup cars.  Turbo S's are for the
street.  Turbo Cup cars were for the track in Canada, Germany and South
Africa, and were lightened, had full roll cages, no power steering,
doorlocks, windows, or mirrors, stiffer suspension (read truck like ride),
Recaro racing seat, etc.

Turbo S's used some pieces proved out on the Cup cars, such as a larger
turbo, larger intake manifold, larger, 928 S4 front brakes, etc. They were
offered in 1988 in addition to normal Turbos.  The 1989 Turbo is essentially
the same as an 88 Turbo S, but was not called an S.

Someone is trying to play up what he has at the expense of truth.  A goo 88
Turbo S or an 89 Turbo are EXCELLENT cars though.

Some 911 front hub dust caps have a threaded nut welded on. This makes
pulling them off easy; just thread a slide hammer onto the nut and yank it
straight off.
 
If your cap doesn't have such a nut, it's easy enough to weld or braze one
on (or have a local welding shop do it, cost should be minimal). Check for
adequate clearance between nut and backside of decorative hubcap in center
of your wheels, though. There should be plenty of space but YMMV etc.

Current rules prohibit the import of any model for which there is not
an existing federalized US model, unless the importer wishes to do the
whole federalization processs, including all paperwork, bonding and 
any destructive testing necessary. Damn near no  one does this, but there's
a guy in Arizona that did all this nonsense so he can import, federalize,
and sell Mercedes G-wagens.

Given that, unless someone wants to spend about a megabuck on the legal
aspects, and crash at least two 959s to satisfy the testing (note: that's
*AT LEAST* -- they can require you to do it again. And again. And ...)
I'd guess that it won't happen.

Call the DOT. You have to be compliant with all relevant US DOT regs, plus
the relevant EPA regs. If you have paperwork saying that it's legal,
and you have a clear US title, you're probably OK. Unless the car was "done"

Subject: re: 959's in this country...


Someone commented that Bill Gates bought 2 959's and one of them
failed a crash test. As far as I know this is totally false. There
were in fact 2 959's in Seattle at one point, one was Bill Gates' the
other belonged to MS cofounder Paul Allen. A friend of mine has a very
nice picture of Bill's 959 crossing the 520 floating bridge followed
by another friend's F-40.  

When I was an intern many years ago they threw a summer intern party
at Bill's place with all the head honcho's so you could meet them. I
asked Bill what he though of his Lexus LS400 , if they were as good as
everyone said. He replied enthusiaticly that it was a beautiful car. I
then asked him what other cars he currently had, and he said a 911
cab, a '60-s something 'stang and a "959 on the dock somewhere in
california," with a note of sadness. The story on this as I heard it
from another person, who although not Bill is pretty reliable. Is that
both 959's came in liscensed in Germany to an MS of Germany employee
who was here working, they were therefore legal to drive with German
plates. After a year they had to renew the registration so they
shipped them back over to Germany to re-register, and then were
bringing them back in when they were stopped. 

Someone else told me they tried to sneak one in through canada and got
caught there too, but this has never been confirmed.

Anyway, there is at least one 959 in this country legally, as I last
saw it at the Meadowbrook Concours in Michigan, I think at that time
the GM proving grounds had it to play with. Also there were rumours of
being able to ship one in legally for track use only, kinda like the
Ford RS-200 that I would so much love to own one day.

Subject: Re: Braided Brake Lines

>  Since these lines are used in aircraft, 

OK, please GET THIS: use in aircraft is roughly similar to use in race
cars. Parts have a "life" rating -- when they are so old, measured in 
racing hours, flight hours, or just plain wall clock time, they're 
removed, discarded, and replaced. In the time interval between the
time they're installed and the time that they're junked, there are
regular inspection intervals called out by the maintenece schedule for
that part. If it doesn't pass inspection, it gets pulled early. If you
see enough of that, the part either gets its "useful life" rating shortened,
or it gets de-rated for use. Period.

Now: when someone can show me that they really do this on their STREET CAR,
I'll tell them to go ahead and use the braided lines. But most people 
don't even *THINK* about such parts. It'll get installed and that's
the last anyone will think about it until there's some other compelling
reason to crawl into that part of the car. Hence the recommendation to
not use them.

Once again, fitness for use is *NOT* **EVER** to be imputed from use in
an analogous situation. FOR ANYTHING!!!

My concern is the electrical part of it. I would appreciate if you write

whether the wiring is ready there so that I could just put the switch
and install the wiper to the hatch with a few simple connections. If this

 Hi Porschephiles,
 
 As you may recall, I am a college student STILL in search of my first 
Porsche. My budget is $5,000. It has to be reasonable to maintain and a 
blast to drive!  Most likely I'll get a 924S or 944 (85.5>)

I saw a few ads for Porsches and I would like some feedback from the list.

I saw another ad for an '86 Turbo for $2900, had an engine fire, in 
fair condition. What kind of damage are we looking at? (wiring, etc)
How much would it cost me to repair?  Would it be cost-effective?

Also, some 928's going for attractive prices as well. My dream Porsche is 
the 928 (with the exception of the 959!). One '79 Euro 928 in need of paint
for $4,000 and an '81 US model in vgc for $5,200 (same dealer). 
I have heard about the astronomical parts prices and maintenance costs.
How much are we talking ? Ballpark figures ?
Put the 928 dream on hold for now, right !!!

 
As always, any and all advise/suggestions appreciated.
 
Thanks in advance,

Subject: 912 Weber backfiring problem

Scott,

Warm engine.  Disconnect the throttle linkages to both
carbs.  Ensure all idle mixture screws are adjusted out the
same amount and use your newly purchased (I hope:) airflow
meter to measure each circuit.  Balance between the front
and back throats by opening the air bypass screw on the
lowest reading throat.  Work this on one carb at a time
then go to the other carb.  Now balance the carbs to each
other by turning in the idle speed screw on the lowest
reading carb.  At this point all throats should indicate
the same air flow.  Set idle to desired rpm by turning the
idle speed screws equal amounts.  Check the airflow again.
Use an accurate tachometer to adjust the idle mixture
screws evenly until best idle is attained.  This part is
nearly impossible without an accurate tach.  Some may have
the feel for adjusting four mixture screws 1/8th turn and
and telling if the idle is up or down 25 rpm.  I don't.
Most books say about 2 1/2 turns out but I have mine
running at 1 1/4 turns.  Too lean mixture often results in
the popping and backfiring you mention.  

My car has a big bore kit, K&N's, fuel pressure regulator
set to 1 1/2 -- ?pounds? (never checked it with a pressure
gauge, have to do that this weekend).  I have a cheepie
in-line fuel filter before the fuel pump (I know I'll be
jumped for this but I have no cavitation problems.  Better
than splitting the line in that busy space above the
distributor).  An important point, Webers must be perfectly
clean.  Some neighbor kids peed in my tank when my mover
was down for paint and I'm still changing filters every
other tank and pulling the carbs every 1K.  Thank God for
the spares.  I still pop a little bit when I first start up
on cold mornings.  It gets kinda cold here sometimes in
Missouri and this puppy ain't no driveway daisy (but it's a
long way from being stretcher bait). 

You've made the right move in getting (only?) one of "The
Maestro's" books and the Haynes manual.  If you got the
hair to pull those babies down and rebuild them, I know you
have the skill and perseverane to make them run properly.
There's no mystery to the Webers.  As a matter of fact, the
40 IDFs are my second favorite carbs.  Ease of dissasembly
(notice how the main jet stack can be removed with carbs on
vehicle? ).  adjustability, commonality of parts (Fast
Freddy's in CA can get you just about any jets you want).
Hell, they even put them on Yugo's (progressive Weber 2
barrel).  My personal favorite, however, is still the
hydraulically dampened variable venturi SU's found on
earlier Volvo's.  (Motorcyle meets car!)

My setup:

Main Jet     115
Air Correction     200
Idle Jet      50
Idle Air     Not mapped (where is "idle air" anyway?)
Venturi           28

     Bolt     String        Shim Stock

I used a couple of SAE Grade 5 5/8-11 X 3.5" bolts (the
purist would only consider using original rear engine mount
through bolts for April 1966 and on, p/n 900.082.031.02 
M 12x1 5x115, per Spare Parts Manual pg 1/13a A, available at
your local Porsche dealer at only $??.?? a copy).  Cut a
rectagular piece of shim stock and punch a hole in it (I
used brass .005" 'cause it punches so easy).  Tie the
string through the hole and then around the head of the
bolt.  Viola!  You know, in retrospect I guess you could
use lead wheel weights (as long as you weighed them for
balance) to protect the sheet metal a little more.  The
powder coating on mine seems tuff enough to shed 00 buck.

Put the shim stock under the Idle Speed Screw (no. 27 pg.
166 Haynes Weber Carburetors manual, no. 36 pg. 50 Bob
Tomlinsons Original Weber Tech Manual) on both sides.  Have
a friend with a steady foot SLOOOOWLY depress the
accelerator.  See which one drops first.  Shorten that
linkage leg (or lengthen the other one).  If you're real
anal (and what Porsche owner isn't?) you'll keep on going
'till they both drop at EXACTLY the same time.  Repeat
procedure three times (or until your eyes cross).  Sure
beats the hell out of trying to eyeball two linkages two feet
apart with too much of your arm wrapped behind the engine
pushing on a greasy bellcrank!

For Chris,

You know what the trouble with E-Mail is?  You can shoot
first and ask questions later.  I should have known SOMEONE
out there had made velocity stacks work on 40 IDF's with
K&Ns and call me on it.  Guilty as charged.  My experience
came after I had just rebuilt my "spare" set and noticed
the stacks that came with them.  No p/n but 39mm throat X
44mm high, about typical from what I've seen.  I had just
bead blasted them and they looked sooooo cool (as if
someone is going to look under your air cleaners to check
out your stacks).  The performance was great from about
4-6K rpm but the bottom end was gutted.  It got to where I
was embarrassed driving around town.  After messing with
every adjustment known to carb and engine I finally
remembered about the velocity stacks I had installed.  I
removed them and drivability returned.  The moral of this
story is that even <I> can't see velocity stacks underneath
the filters.  My theory is insufficient clearance between
the top of the stacks and the top plate of the filter would
not allow the stacks to do their job (and who wants to run
unfiltered stacks on the street?  You can see what that
crap they put on the roads does to the body, can you
imagine it inside your engine?)

Naresh,
In both the cars that you have listed the purchase price is easily the
cheapest part of the deal. There are bunches od aluminium parts in the 86
turbo, not to mention a myriad of wiring, hoses, sensors,paint work etc. Cars
that have had fires, especially complicated cars, are a NIGHTMARE. Right up
there with flood damage.
Forget the 928. The first time it needs any kind of significant repair (oh
and it will) you will want to put a gun to your head.
Take your money and find the nicest 944 that you can. Hopefully, if you're
patient, you can find one with a documented maintenance history that will fit
in your budget,
Good luck

    Um, yeah.  What he said.  I've looked at three 914's out here (PA)
and every single one of them was either wrecked/badly repaired or so
rusted I had to climb out the window (really!  It looked pretty,
though.)  I feel like I got a good deal on my 914.... BTW, it's now
fully driveable (except it needs new shifter bushings and I still have
to put on the new master cyl.) so all I have to do is get the new
rockers/front fender installed and I'm street legal and rollin'!  I did
check very thoroughly when I bought the car to make sure the rockers
were the only bad panels.
    And I think I remember the original poster saying something about
don't put all your "goodies" on a rusted car... that's kind of why I
bought this one, it had all sorts of good stuff included with it, like
an extra suspension, a functional heater, factory alloys, etc.  I figure
if I do get discouraged i can just strip the car and drag home a good
shell with nothin' on it and still come out ahead.

     Maybe your shop will know this, but you must remove and install the
 aluminum trim -only- when the  is out of the car. Don't try and remove it 
 while it is in the car; correct procedure is to remove the windshield and
 gasket,  always replace any gasket older than 5 years (these are cheap, one
 of Porsche's real bargains), then install the trim before trying to place
 the windshield. If you try and remove or install the trim at any other time
 it will become hopelessly mangled.

      In case the anodizing is worn off the trim, or its buggered already,
  Porsches' price for the trim is also very reasonable (i.e., similar trim
  for a Ferrari 308 runs about $800...on top of the $1300 windshield...
  replacing a windshield in a Testarossa is a $4000 venture !). The trim is 
  very soft, it shouldn't be "formed" unless it has already got a kink in it.
  Then just flatten it between 2 boards, don't do this in your hands. Also
  don't try to polish the aluminum, you'll risk removing the anodizing and
  it will look splotchy.

     The hard thing on the 2 911s I've done seems to be getting a good
  fit around the upper corners of the glass. There always seems to be
  something of a gap on the upper corners that you have to fill with Silicone.
  Both mine were the original windshields in undamaged frames, so I have
  to wonder if it isn't a 911 characteristic....

If you can find a good one(ie. orig, rust free, mech sound, etc) I think a 69
 - 71 T would be a good choice. I've had both 2.0(69) and 2.2(70-71) varieties
and though they were great.  The 2.2T seems to go on forever like a 3.0 SC
and would make a great combo driver/autox car.  I like these cars because
they're carbureted - if you don't mind FI, both 2.0 and 2.2 AND 2.4E would
again be good combination cars.  The S cars from all 69 -73 would be great at
the track, but you'll spend more to buy one and it probably wouldn't be as
reasonable to drive on a daily basis.

Subject: 924 Cold starting Problems

Hi All...
Some of you may remmember me writing the same things about 1 year ago...
Well I'm finally back on this continent and have had time to mess with
the car...
The car is a '79 924 that will start fine warm but takes either
multiple crankings or dowsing the air-filter in carb cleaner/starting
fluid to get it to crank over on the first try cold.
I have replaced the fuel pump relay, cleaned all fuel lines and systems,
The air sensor plate doesn't sit perfect, but this was a problem 
when I got the car and it started then fine cold...
I also replaced the ignition switch, tumbler and all...
I also verified the cold start valve isn't leaking or anything..

WHAT I HAVE DISCOVERED! is the the cold start valve isn't getting
any juice, when I branched it directly to the battery one day, out
came a nice conical spray.  (I made sure the coolant was cool)
So why isn't it getting any juice? I hate electrics, and have a limited
knowledge.. I have HAYNES wiring diagrams but I find them confusing :-/
If anyone has the patience to try to follow through with me on this
I would very much appreciate it!
Thanks tons in advance!

Yes, in fact, you may be looking at a lot of trouble.

On the other hand, this car may be a creampuff.

I noticed that your userid is badkarma... It reminds me of a quote from the
John Muir book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive" (before the days of the
H2O cooled VWs.  He said that when you're looking to buy a car, sit down and
try to understand the karma of the vehicle you're looking at. Just try to
absorb the aura of the car...

So, to paraphrase: If you're good at this sort of thing, take a good,
critical look at things like the seats (for wear), and engine oil (smell it
for a burned smell) and the engine compartment (dirty, clean, in between?)
and brake rotors (burned, scored, rusty?) and the transmission (oily, etc.)

You get the idea.

If you're not good at this sort of thing, have a good Porsche mechanic that
you trust (kind of a strange juxtaposition of words in this sentence...)
take a good long look at this car for you...

Also, keep in mind that it is *very easy* to adjust the mileage on a VDO
odometer (Not that *I* would ever do such a thing, but it has been known to 
happen...)

Good luck,

Most likely problem is the thermoswitch.  If it is like Audis, this is 
on the rear of the motor, near the firewall.  They go bad all the time and 
keep the cold start valve from releasing fuel...

Subject: 944S slow starting

I recently bought a 1987 944S which I've put about 2k miles on since, mostly
driving it home from North Carolina to Colorado.  Overall, I'm very pleased 
with my new toy, but there's one annoying little problem.

When I first picked the car up, it would fire within a revolution or two of 
turning the key, and quickly go to idle.  Since I've been home, it often takes
a half dozen or more revolutions to catch cold, and will fire quickly but not
stay running when warm unless I blip the accelerator while or just after
cranking.  As soon as it reaches idle, all is well with the world.  

I don't even have a Haynes book for it yet, much less a set of factory manuals, 
though I plan to start acquiring docs in the next week... and the engine is
(of course!) much different/better from the 924 it replaced!  In the meantime,
are there any obvious things to check?  I should point out that "home" is at
7300 feet elevation, and the car is rarely going to be below 6300 feet unless
I'm travelling...

Subject: Considering 944 purchase

I read that Naresh has $5000 to spend and is considering a 944.

Naresh (and anyone else with similar finances), be careful! 

You mentioned that you are a student, so I will assume you don't have huge
income. So before you sign on the dotted line, check out some things very
carefully.

944s have a lot of Achiles Heels; the motor mounts go bad (over and over),
the water pumps go bad (over and over), the rubber centered clutch disc goes
bad (you need to remove the entire driveshaft and rear-end/transaxle to
replace the stupid thing), if you don't take good care of the timing belt, it
will break and cause all the valves to bend.... These parts are very
expensive, with the labor to replace them being astronomical.

A lot of people selling used 944s are doing so because they got in over their
heads (they had $5000 budgets, with none left over for upkeep and no huge
income for unforseen failures) and are having to cut their losses-so the cars
they're selling may have hidden, serious, expensive problems.

Call some reputable shops (not gas stations or "bargain" one-man shows) and
ask for some quotes on common things like tuneups, etc. Ask how much parts
cost (stay away from mail order...few professional shops will install
owner-supplied parts).

If you plan to spend $5000 to purchase a 944, plan to have $2000 or more set
aside, just in case. Also, when shopping for a car, take it to a good shop
first...make sure you don't buy someone else's problems.

    Going from memory (not usually advisable), the two biggest
reasons the 959 wouldn't pass US specs are the bumper construction
and the ride height.  I think that the 959 had adjustable ride hight
so the faster the speed, the lower the car.  I'm not sure if the
issue was adjustability or the initial height of the car.  Perhaps I
can check on this and get back to the list, but memory will have to
suffice for now.

	In CA, just ask DMV and, I believe, pay a fee.  You must give a 
reason for wanting the information, and the registered owner will be 
notified that you were asking (don't know whether they give the owner

By the way, Stan, I AM the type who would replace braided lines YEARLY, when
I rebuild my braking system. However, if there were other problems with these
lines, or there was a problem of inferior quality which you raised, where it
concerns what is available to the automotive industry, then I wanted to know.
 If I cannot determine what is a decent and SAFE brand of braided brake line,
and it seems like that is a VERY REAL PROBLEM, then I will remove them from
my car, and go back to factory PORSCHE rubber lines, which I will still
replace on a periodic basis.  Anything else would be pretty stupid, agreed?

Lou,

Question #1 - Heat cycling tires is done by bringing them up to TRACK
operating temperature ~ 200 degrees fahrenheit, then allowing them to cool.
 But this is not something that is done to "break in" the tires, like you
would do with brakes.  It is something that happens when you use them.  BTW,
most tires work the best right out of the box, and thier performance
deteriorates with each heat cycle.  That is why most race teams use "sticker
tires", that is new tires, when they need the most speed, or they will run
new tires for a few laps to test them, and save them for when they are
needed.

Question #2 - I'm not a whole lot of help here.  R1's definately have the
stiffer inner sidewall, if the street Comps look similar to the R1's, then
they should have the stiffer inner sidewall as well.

Subject: Re: Turning brake rotors

Having read the flurry of postings on this subject, I figured I'd add my .02c
worth.  I've had luck merely replacing the pads on several cars (911 P cars
included) when the rotors were in good shape (no scoring or warps).

Problem is "bedding" the new brake pads to the shiny rotor surface.  The
marraige of slicked up rotor to fresh pads is like any other (ie. some work,
some don't).  I think it depends on the pad material to a great extent
(metal, semi-met, organic, compounds).

I've simply thrown new pads on without turning the rotors without problem and
have sometimes just roughed up the rotors with a pad sander to give the new
pads something to bite.  Usually, however, I have the rotors turned just
enough to break the glaze.  If you go to a reputable machine shop they'll
honor your request and take off just enough to clean em' up.  Cheap
insurance.  Who wants to go back and do the job again?

Ideally, you'd flush it after removing the failing rack so as not to 
bring more junk into the system.  But you don't want to circulate 
remaining debris into the new rack either.  Net: you're hosed.

In reality, there should be extremely little or no debris in the system 
unless you had a really bad failure, or dumped something in the 
resevoir.  You should be fine just installing the new rack and doing 
the normal flush.

I've lost 2 racks on my '86 951, and a friend lost 1 on his '86.  Seems

Subject: 17 vs 18-in. track tires

Not in my opinion.

Here's what I just put on my SC3.4

F:  9.5x17 -w- 275-40-17  BFG Comp T/A R:  11.0x17 -w- 315-35-17

I'm out $1650 for NEW forged 3 peice wheels AND tires.  $620 (approx)
for the tires.

That's for 10.2 + 11.9 " of rubber on what is apparently the optimal
rims.

From my calculation, (315mm * .35 / 25.4 mm/in) the sidewalls are  4.3:
total, but only about 3.75" measurable above the rim. This is confirmed by the BFG tire
charts

That's pretty low.  Interetingly enough, there is actually slightly  more
sidewall on these tires than on 245-45-16" because they are so damn
wide, even 35 aspect doesn't offset it.


The sidewalls are VERY stiff and and it should yeild a nice contat patch. 

Lookng at the sizes listed in Tire Rack, (pano) rears are 265-35-18, with 3.75" sidewall so there is a significant difference, with almost identical diameter (25.6")  The question is - is 256 adequate for the rears?  Also - what othetr sizes are available?

I would think Goodyear would make some slicks in 18".

If money is no object - great!  Personally I see 2 sets minimum a year
being $2400 I can throw at the car elsewhere.  Guess it depends on your
budget.

Thoughts?

Hi all, 
Back online with a new account. The pcar has had its share of problems this
winter. I just got the it back from from the body shop (Daytona in Long
Island City, NY) where they repaired and repainted the door after someone
decided to try a crow bar vs a key. 
 
Problem #1 The 1 year old Fuchs now have white splotches all over the
metallic edges, not the black centers. Is this definitely the dreaded
acidic car wash syndrome? How can I know for sure? The wheels have never
been run through a drive-thru car wash. Anything to try before polishing it
out with 3M glaze and Blue Magic? It would seem that once I remove the
clearcoat via these methods, there is no going back. Is there a local (NYC,
NY) place that refinishes Fuchs? any paint shop OK? or should I mail them
to Woods? I'm also inclined to have the black centers repainted to Pearl
White at the same time, but not if the finish is inferior to the original. 
 
Problem #2 The door now needs to be pulled a little harder to close. I did
have a new door seal installed. Normal? 
 
Problem #3 I asked the body shop for some touch up paint, since Porsche no
longer seems to sell those handy little tubes. The car is an '86 Pearl
White 951. As far as I know, that is the only year that Porsche used that
as a stock color. The body shop said that the paint is 2-stage, looks bad
when touched up, and they would not provide it. 
 
#4 This shop also installs a version of an Immobiliser alarm called the
Sure-lock. The Immobiliser seems to be real popular in England, but
relatively unknown in America. Anybody recommend these things?

Subject: Re: 911 T  front brakes

Hi Pat:

On stuck brake calipers - In the past I've taken really bad one-piece
calipers and "baked" them in an oven for 30 minutes at some reasonable
temperature (200-250 F).

This made a big difference, and I was able to release the pistons on short
order thereafter.  KEEP IN MIND, HOWEVER, that calipers that have "halves"
and therefore O-rings between the halves may be adversely affected by the
heat - I don't know what maximum temperature caliper sealing O-rings can
take.

Also, 60 psi is probably too little to do much good - I typically use a
Presta-valve bike pump, and it exceeds 100psi before the pistons come out. 

I've always been able to rebuild my calipers, so I can't advise on a source
of rebuilt ones.

Subject: 944 oil and water ...

So ...

In looking over my 944 last week I found some nice white gunk in the
cooling overflow tank. So, I have oil getting into my oil. I changed and
checked my oil, and as far as I can tell, there is no evidence of water
entering the oil (no foamy brown gunge or other traces of water).

In any case, I have an '84 944 (ie. - not supposed to have the dreaded
water cooler seal problem) so I'm wondering, is oil getting into the water
via the oil cooler or via the head gasket. I suppose that where ever it is
leaking into the water it happened on one of those mid winter cold starts
where the oil pressure was insanely high and it just made a seal give way.
What are the chances that high oil pressure could cause a leak to start in
the oil cooler itself (as opposed to just a seal)?


Any help would really be welcome, I want to try to correct this problem as
quickly as possible. My suspicions are that it is the oil cooler seal and
not the head gasket as the oil cooler seal seems to be a weak point on the
car. Could I be wrong?


regards,
trev.

Your heater blower is stock.  Some smog "mechanics" with less than
perfect Porsche knowledge will try to connect the capped over tube
to your air cleaner some how.  Every time I get my 914 smogged I
forget that fact, and have to go buy a new cap.

There was a thread not too long ago about 914 brake bleeding.  
Basically, you should bleed the master cylinder, the front brakes,
the proportioning valve, and the rear brakes, in (somewhat) that
order.

What you want to do is start at the master cylinder, and move the
air out to the end, and bleed it off.  Hitting every possible
point in between.

Glad to help (if this did help).

Barton...I will take your flaming as a friendly reminder about manners and
protocol. If it was not intended to be "friendly", please let me know so that
I can generate the appropriate feelings towards you!  In fairness, you should
also chastize Stan, as HE did not include my questions in his response to me,
and he flamed me first, so there!

Seriously, there are probably thousands of Porsche drivers out there running
around with these braided brake lines, and if it is as big a problem as you
say, a small amount of rhetoric from Stan is not really sufficient to make an
impact on this subject.  This list seems to generate tons of responses to
banal subjects like paint polishes and motor oils, but not much to something
important like this.  We are talking about the potential for serious injury
or death, and so I will re-issue my questions with a few more so that
everyone can benefit!

It has been stated that Braided Brake Lines are for racing and must be
inspected (monthly?) and replaced (probably?) on an annual basis.  Fair
enough!  For those who wish to continue to run them:

1) There is a concern about differing quality of these lines, how can you
tell which ones are good?
2) Braided lines like these are made for the refrigeration industry as a
replacement for metal tubing, and rubber hosing.  The environment that they
operate under is harsher, and they are expected to last 10 years.  How long
should the automotive ones last?
3) What should you look for as far as a potential defect in these lines,
besides the obvious rubbing or leaking.
4) When they fail, do they burst immediately, leaving no brakes, or will they
give some warning, like a soft pedal before they fail?

For those of use who will probably go back to factory rubber lines:

1) What is the life expectancy on these?
2) The obvious inspection is for cracks or leaks...anything else?
3) If the rubber line fails, what kind of warning will IT give?

NO FLAMES, JUST FACTS!

Hi Ed,

I think you'll have a hard time finding Swepco 201 synthetic because I don't think it
exists.   $wepco 201 is a non-synthetic primo dino juice with some special chemical 
additives that give a nice blue hue.  The general concensus is that, for the Porsche 915
transmission, $wepco is the "right stuff".  I place a similar query before p-philes a 
couple of weeks ago and was generally convinced by the masses that I should use 
this stuff in my newly rebuilt tranny.  In fact, I was so convinced that I bought a whole 
case of the stuff and have sold two of the surplus gallons to local Porsche
clubbers for their cars.  Granted, I have no first hand knowledge of its effectiveness
since the car I have put it in is currently suffering from horsepower deficit disorder.
As such, I have no emperical evidence to back up the claims.  YMMV...

Trev,

Almost certainly the oil/water heat exchanger seals.  Per your question,
the cooler itself can fail, and there is a factory tool to pressure test it,
out of the car.  Looks like a big C-clamp.

Head gasket failure is really very uncommon on aspiros.  Anything is
possible, but I'd start with the exchanger.  BTW, Porsche recommends
you drop the oil pan and check the rod bearings for water damage.
This is a bunch more work, not to mention the cost of the ingenious but
pricey pan gasket.  If you see absolutely no coolant in the oil, when you
drain the oil, perhaps you can get away without dropping the pan.

With respect to it being a weak spot, there was a run of bad seal kits
in MY87.  Since then, Porsche has had problems getting mechanics to
shim the cooler properly on re-installation.  You should be OK once
both have been taken care of.

Subject: braided brake lines


The common wisdom in the UK car tuning world, is that braided lines are 
better than rubber.

They have two main benefits -
	they are a lot stronger ie they do not expand under pressure, and 
hence give a firmer pedal.
	They are less susceptable to abrasion.

WRT check intervals, on an aircraft (UK) they would be checked every 50 
hours or yearly - 50 aircraft hours probably equates to every 3000 miles 
for a car.

I for one would normally expect to check my hoses every 10k miles, and 
have yet to see any more problems with steel braided than with rubber 
clad hoses. UK cars get a yearly thorough MOT check and brake hoses and 
lines are one of the most common failures. The rubber hoses usually fail 
for perish cracks, the lines for rust - poor quality material ( not P 
cars ) rarely does a brake hose of any type fail the test at less than 5 
years of age

Refrigorators - when did a fridge get cornered thru rocks at 80 mph at an 
ambient of 110 deg f with red hot brake particles being thrown on to it's 
hoses - I think that is a spurious comparison. In the general scheme of 
things, it is acknowledged that motor car usage puts a more severe test 
on components than any other type of environment.

Subject: New 911 Turbo / Porsche 4WD

I was at the Geneva motor show last weekend and saw the new 911 turbo.
It's certainly am impressive looking beast, considerably wider track
than the standard carrera.  Very wide rear tyres (285/30, 18").
There are quite a number of not-so-subtle styling clues so that the
car looks much more potent than a standard 911.

"Auto Motor und Sport" a few weeks ago had a comparison between a
number of 4WD cars to see how they perform in snow.  The 911 C4 did
very badly in these tests (the conclusion was basically that the car
is pretty lousy in snow.  They often had the situation where the car
was stuck with the rear tyres spinning in the snow and the front tyres
stationary ).  This week AMuS report that Porsche now claims they've
tightened the spec on the minimum amount of torque the visco coupling
must transmit to the front axle under worst-case conditions.
Previously it used to be 40% +/- 6%, the spec has now been tightened
to 40% - 0%, + 6%.  Porsche claims they have no plans to replace the
visco couplings on already-delivered 911 C4's.  In the article they
also recommended particular brands of snow tyres for use on the C4.
AMuS reports that a test drive with a C4 with the tighter-spec'ed
coupling was better, although still not great.  Mind you, hopefully
nobody buys a 911 to drive in the snow.  That's why Subarus were
created.

As I'm about to start selling AmsOil myself, I'll tell ya what I know 
(and no, it isn't biased)... First, AmsOil is some good stuff, and 
because it is full synthetic based, you can go 15k miles without changing 
it. HOWEVER, it is pretty stupid to go that long if you know what goes 
through your engine in just 3k miles (which is why he's reommending 
changing the filter every 3k miles.

Now, the answer about how good it is... It's great oil, smooth running 
and such, but not for $8. He's really hosing you on this one. The 
seller's manual recommends $4.95 be the selling price (which isn't too 
much more than say Mobil 1 or Slick 50). Tell him you know he should sell 
it for $4.95 per quart, maybe he'll break.

BTW, I'm working on starting up a small business called Vintage 
VW/Porsche Partshaus (Vintage VW and Vintage Porsche, sorry 9x4/9x8 
owners) I'm interested in knowing what I should stock. This business 
willhopefully be up and running (in some form) by early summer at 
absolute latest. We currently have a prototype catalog and have checked 
on VW copyrights (interesting story there: "Hm, well, VW doesn't have a 
legal department, I can ask PR though... hold on") as Porsche very easily 
pounces people about their name (remember Porsche Magazine?) I really

Subject: Re: 944 sunroofs

    How the heck does the power roof on the 944 S come off?   The directions
    simply say to raise the roof via the rocker switch, undo the two front
    switches, and pull up. I tried this but it seemed like I'd break the plastic
    arms that raise the back of the roof before it would come free.  What step(s)
    am I missing?

I just checked the 924/944/951 FAQ and, sure enough, it's not in there. I don't
have my manuals handy, but the trick is to shut the car off, then turn the key
to the (second?) detent.  Then, hit the down side of the switch.  The forks
will retract, and the roof can then be lifted right off (after you unfasten the
latches in the front, of course!).  Assembly, as they say, is the reverse of
disassembly -- fit the air deflector into the leading edge of the sunroof, then
lower the panel until it's almost flush with the roof, then shove it forward to
make sure it's positioned properly.  Pull your fingers out the let it drop into
place.  Get back into the car, turn the key to the third detent and open the
sunroof, then close it.  This will move the forks into their normal position
and lock the sunroof down so it won't lift at speed.

This is all documented in the owner's manual, but that didn't help me until
I'd read it about a dozen times...

Dear Chip,

I should probably print our official appraisal sheet. If there is enough

In evaluating your car per our quickie appraisal questionaire, the color
change kills it. Never color change any car. Unless it is stripped to a bare
body shell and dipped or media blasted, one can never achieve a proper job.
However, since your car is rust free and has a great interior and is fuel
injected, it is still worth every bit of 3900. This is assuming the clean
shiny paint under the trunks is saturn yellow. IF not, deduct 800 more!

Don't sell you car, Chip. It has too much sentimental value. Repaint it that

Dear Tim,

All 73-74 and early 1975 914s had only a single short supplementary heater
blower hose. Since the engine fan blew most of the heat through the heat
exchangers, Porsche thought they could save money by using only one hose.
However, they found this solution unacceptable and in  the middle of the 75
production run, connected a Y and a long heater hose to the passenger J pipe.
All 75-1/2 - 76 modles have a Y connection and passenger side hose. 70-72
models have a dual port blower mounted on the left side of the impellor
housing and also dual blower hoses. I'm sorry they made us 73-74 914 owners
suffer heater output (you don't need to suffer, though, because DR. 914 had
an update made to retrofit to the 73-74 cars!).

Master cylinders are best bench bled before installation. Make sure before
bolting the cylinder to the bulkhead that you force the supply lines from the
resevoir into the cylinder. It is almost impossible after mounting, and loose
supply lines suck air. Bleed right rear, left rear, righ front and finally
left front.

A good trick is to crack all 8 73-76 brake caliper bleeders and fill the
resevoir letting the lines drip for an hour. This helps prebleed the brakes
and makes the job easier.

(heavy sigh, What *is* a mother to do...)  In all fairness, I *gave* you a

if you can still locate it.  (No?  Ok, I will give you one more, also free of

> In fairness, you should also chastize Stan, as HE did not include my questions
> in his response to me, and he flamed me first, so there!

Let me dissect this and offer a threefer:  

First:  Stan is a *very* busy man, to whom we *all* owe an inestimable
debt of gratitude!  He *created* and runs Porschephiles for us on the
equipment and bandwidth that is his means of earning his daily bread.

We have discussed here recently how this is starting to have a
*significant* impact upon his income-genreating resources.  Those of us
who appreciate the *enormoous* benefits we have derived from Stan's
generosity over the years (year plus, in my case), have started a fund to
purchase new equipment to be devoted exclusively to keeping Porschephiles
going and allowing Stan to have the full use of his hardware resources.

This does not address the impact that Porschephiles message traffic has
upon Stan's T-1 line.  If we can raise enough money to address that, we
will.  We ought to.  (see my custodian's report later this morning - we
still have less than 100 contributors, and have only raised $4,100 to
date.  Considering that we have 1200 members deriving benefit, that's an
underwhelming response rate).

So here's part one of the threefer *Clue*:  Flaming *Stan* is not *ever*
an action that a person with a grip, or a modicum of comity, would do.

Part two of the threefer follows part one.  You feel that Stan should be
chastized because he did not include all of your question when
responding. (Larry, here is where a grip would have been *ever* so
useful...) Memorize this:  Stan does *not* *owe* any of us *anything*!
Further, his response was a model of clarity in making his point, which
you do seem to have grasped.  That you still have some unanswered
questions is unfortunate, but a simple, *courteous* mention of that fact
would have been the appropriate response.  You will always get more help
when you demonstrate your grasp of the concept that those offering *any*
response are doing you a courtesly.  One who flames another for failing
to respond to one's full and complete satisfaction, is likely to be
percieved as an ill-mannered child, and receive a response appropos to
that perception.

The third part of the threefer, Part C., is that I did *not* flame you, I
*gently* chided you, as I have done again in this.  I used to live with a
*great* old cat, named (very appropriately) "Spike."  Spike had been born
and lived the first nine or so years of his life, wild.  He was large,
and possed *awesome* claws and fangs.  A true gentleman, Spike would, on
occasion, feel the need to communicate the message that some behavior of
mine was inappropriate.  He'd grab my arm in his paws (that most closely
resembeled Catcher's-Mitts equipped with meat-hooks), then look up
directly into my eyes; when he had my complete attention (which, may
I assure you, he *assuredly* did have), "Poink!" he'd give me a touch,
the merest *hint* of his claw-tips.  This, my friend, has been such a 
message.  I trust you'll take it in the same spirit; recognize the error
of your ways, and go forth and sin no more...(he said with a more good

When I lived up north, I used my 951 in the snow and found it to be

however illustrate the problem that is being discussed here on the

Subject:      Gates 959 and others

    I finally went to my semi-authorized Gates biography for the semi-
approved scoop on the 959, etc.  The book was reviewed and ok'd by
Gates, but not co-written.  The bottom line is this is the most
reliable info I have on the subject.

    Gates and Allen bought two 959s together at the end of 1988.
Gates got a silver one and Allen a white one.  They paid $380,000
each and were able to drive them for a year as has been previously
noted.  When the foreign exemption ran out in Jan 90, the cars got
stored.  It would have cost $30,000 to ship the cars to Germany and
go through that process.  The cars were stored in a Free Trade Zone
warehouse in Oakland while Gates and Allen tried to argue with the
feds about certification.  In the meantime, an Allen employee flies
down every few weeks to start the engines and makes sure they are
roadworthy.

    That's the most recent info I have, but the book is two years
old.  The rumors about putting the car in a trailer in Washington and
trying to sneak it in through Canada are intriguing.

    Other Gates info:  his FIRST car was a used dark green 911 which
he drove quite hard.  In addition to the Lexus daily driver, he has a
Mustang, Porsche C4 cabriolet, and a Ferrari 348.  On the record he
only has one ticket since 1988, but I'm sure there are several others
that the legal staff have dealt with.

No complaints there.  But driving a 911 in snow is (IMHO) a whole bunch
of no fun.  My 911 is my daily driver, but daily driving for me has
to include a large dose of enjoyment.  Driving in snow simply isn't
enjoyable.  It's even less enjoyable when you're worried about being
run into by idiots who haven't even bothered to mount winter tyres,
which in Switzerland is always a problem when the first snow comes,
even if it comes as late as December.

Furthermore, even when there's no snow or ice on the roads in winter,
there's still salt left on the road, so even if you don't drive in
snow, you still need the galvanization, unless you put your car in the
garage until summer.

On top of all that, a sports car wearing snow tyres is only half a
sports car.

>No Subarus for this man!

Nor for me, but I find my old trusty-and-rusty VW Golf Synchro to be
the preferred form of transport when it's snowy/icy.  I frankly don't
care what happens to that car, so long as I survive the accident.

Howdy Philers,

I just got back from from 3000 miles in my Volvo Wagon. It turned 225,000 on
the trip. During the trip several things of interest(maybe) are worth sharing.

I saw the 993 that was driven to Daytona, run for 24 hours and driven back. The
car was owned by a dealer on Fairbanks Street in Orlando. He had the car on
display on his lot. I saw it with the engine cover up and except for the roll
bar looked pretty stock to me. The body took a little abuse in the race so that
it looked like a sightly bloodied solder. He 10 or 12 used Porsches on his lot
all the way from 930's to 356's. One was of special interest for the story and
the opportunity. Nord Nordstrom the owner had a white 1986 Cab. slant nose
metal conversion that has all the right stuff but was well used. Interior
needed redoing, stereo had been stolen etc. It had about 80,000 miles on it. It
was on consignment because the son had been killed in a motorcycle accident
according to the salesperson.  He thought it could be bought in the mid to low
twenties. If you go to Orlando visit Nord's and the dealers across the street
who deal in unusual and older american cars.

The other car of interest was a 1987 944 turbo at the Lincoln Mercury Dealer in
Cocoa Beach. It had been repainted, 102,000 miles by a local Doctor. They were
asking $8,400 but were down to $7000 before I had to leave.

Question #1 - Heat cycling tires is done by bringing them up to
TRACK operating temperature ~ 200 degrees fahrenheit, then
allowing them to cool.
 But this is not something that is done to "break in" the tires, like
you would do with brakes.  It is something that happens when
you use them.  BTW, most tires work the best right out of the
box, and thier performance deteriorates with each heat cycle. 
That is why most race teams use "sticker tires", that is new tires,
when they need the most speed, or they will run new tires for a
few laps to test them, and save them for when they are needed.
> End included text

WRT: The performance of "green" tires.
On the autox list, there's an engineer from BFG who has
been helping those of us who use his product to get the
most out of the R1's.  The word from BFG is that the tires
will work best if they're heat cycled once, then allowed to
cure for 24 hours or so.  I don't know all the details, but
is consistent with my experience.  It's rather easy to wear
a race tire to the cord if you don't cure them first.  I understand
this is even more acute in slicks. 

In addition, if you watch Indycar, Nascar, or F1, you'll notice 
that they typically "scrub-in" all their tire sets in practice 
before raceday so they have a chance to cure.  Qualifiers are 
a different beast since they only have to last a couple of laps. 

Of course, this is all IMHO....

Matt,

Two things:

1. You can now buy low mileag 3.6 liter engines for $7,000. I don't care
who ported and polished the heads or what exhaust is included, there is
no way a 3.2 is worth that much today, especially with 44K miles on it.
In fact, you should be able to get a 3.2 and tranny with less than 30K
miles for $6,000. And then you have the gall to ask for a 3.0 or 3.2
core in exchange?????????????????????????

2. Just what has your friend used this engine for? Is it a track car?

    I finally went to my semi-authorized Gates biography for the semi-
approved scoop on the 959, etc.  The book was reviewed and ok'd by 
Gates, but not co-written.  The bottom line is this is the most 
reliable info I have on the subject.
     
    Gates and Allen bought two 959s together at the end of 1988.
Gates got a silver one and Allen a white one.  They paid $380,000 
each and were able to drive them for a year as has been previously 
noted.  When the foreign exemption ran out in Jan 90, the cars got 
stored.  It would have cost $30,000 to ship the cars to Germany and 
go through that process.  The cars were stored in a Free Trade Zone 
warehouse in Oakland while Gates and Allen tried to argue with the 
feds about certification.  In the meantime, an Allen employee flies 
down every few weeks to start the engines and makes sure they are 
roadworthy.
     
    That's the most recent info I have, but the book is two years
old.  The rumors about putting the car in a trailer in Washington and 
trying to sneak it in through Canada are intriguing.
     
    Other Gates info:  his FIRST car was a used dark green 911 which
he drove quite hard.  In addition to the Lexus daily driver, he has a 
Mustang, Porsche C4 cabriolet, and a Ferrari 348.  On the record he 
only has one ticket since 1988, but I'm sure there are several others 
that the legal staff have dealt with.

Subject: Braided Steel Lines



Okay, Here goes on the subject. 

Like any other type of hose, there are specific braided lines for a 
particular function or liquid. Brake fluid will attack any non-compatable
hose, whether braided or not. I have seen non-compatable lines used 
in SCCA because the owner didn't know hat he was being sold. Fortunately,
the failure was gradual and we were able to help him figure the problem 
out. 

When ordering any hose, whether plain or braided, know the pressure, 
specific application (water, gasoline, oil brake fluid, etc) when 
you order. There will be substancial cost differences in many cases.
Oh yeah, we shouldn't forget whether the line will be under pressure or
suction.

Some of the performance warehouses are stating in their ads that some
braided line is NOT compatable with brake fluid.

As the ends are assembled, have someone that is knowledgable show you
how to assemble and dissassemble the ends from the lines. Purchase
any special tools required.

Braided lines can still be damaged (as can rubber) by friction created
by chassis flex, engine movement, vibration and plain poor installation.
I have a friend that installed a remote oil filter, thermostat and 
oil cooler on his tow vehicle. I notice an oil leak after a club
breakfast, decided to see what could be leaking on a two-month old 
4-wheel drive Blazer. My friend had neatly tie-wrapped the lines to the 
cooler to the front torsion bars. Each time the bar moved, it pulled on 
the lines. The fittings were now loose at the hose, but hadn't pulled 
apart yet. 

Use adele clamps to hold any lines like these in place. Internal pressure
can also make the lines move. These clamps have a single mount point and
securely hold the line in place. ALWAYS use the aluminum with rubber
overlay. Plastic breaks and plain metal will rub and chafe the hose.

Subject: Freeing Brake Pistons



Pat-

If you can't blow out the piston with compressed air
(And as someone else noted, 60 psi isn't very much.
Try 100.) then a sure-fire way to get the piston out
is to reconnect the caliper to the brake line and
step on the brake pedal.  I've never had that fail.

I'd try to repair the units rather than buy rebuilts.
It's unlikely that there's anything wrong with them, and
a repair kit only costs about $5.  Also, you might not
really have to replace the pistons with stainless ones.
Remember, the piston itself doesn't touch the cylinder
wall, only the rubber seal does, so a piston can get
to looking pretty ugly and still do a perfectly good
job.  I'd be willing to bet that the inside of your
pistons (the side you haven't seen yet...) is clean, and
only the outside is rusted.  Wire brush off the rust,
and you should be in good shape.

Subject: 944 oil leaks (aka "Lou's experience...)

Ok folks, here's the poop. I cannot stand leaks! These observations are
based on my own experience with my 85.1 944. I figure I pass this info to you
since Trev and Clint had questions on oil leaks. YMMV

First, lest do the oil cooler. I had a leak comming from the bottom of the oil
cooler. It masked itself by dripping on top on the lower balance shaft assmbly.
I thought I had a LBS seal going. Took it apart, replaced seals, put the whole
thing bacK together. Still leaked. 

I thought I could try to put some gook around the perimeter and put the whole
thing back together. Well, that was a great idea! After starting the engine,
it look like Niagara Falls. As it turns out, there are 2 oil seals (orings)
that did not go where they were supposed to go. I thought I could remove
and fix my leak with the exhaust manifold in place. Well, the
OC cover wont come out!

I ended up taking the head off to replace the oil seals around the oil cooler
cover. The good news is that there is an improved seal that has the orings
mounted to a thin aluminum carrier. So it goes in nice and easy. Got it from
Zims. Also, there are improved (Viton?) seals for the oil cooler.(green)

While I was there, I also replaced the two orings that actually seal the oil
cooler to the engine. Any way, If your oil cooler seals are bad, the head
or at least the exhaust manifold must come out. The nuts on the EM looked
like they were not going to come out. So I took the easy way out and removed
the head/EM in one piece. So I put in a new head gasket.

Watch out for a hanging oil pressure relief valve. I hear there is a tool
to center it while you tighten the OC cover. I used my pinkie to make sure therewas free movement. I've done about 2K with no problems.

What I'm trying to say, is that if the oil cooler seals are bad, you might 
have to do the HG anyway to get to it.

Next, the oil seals. I too, replaced the oil seal on all 3 cams. Watch out for
the lower BS. The shaft rotates in the opposite direction of the other two.
There is a special lower seal (they have little arrows showing rotation).

I was given a tip by a professional P mechanic. It seams that on 928s they
use an inner oring that acts a third oil barrier. The way it works is this.
The shaft has a step down, there is an onion skin plastic gasket that goes
over the shaft and lays against the internal front bearing. In my car,
one of them was missing! 

There is also a part that looks like a top hat. The CS seal rides on the surface. I think you can actually wear a grove on it. If you change the seal, you 
might be ok for a while. I think this might be Clint's problem. Zims sell the
kit that includes the running surfaces (top hats). Any way, the oil seal that
I referred to before, goes inside this top hat. There is an actual grove cut
out for it. The mechanic suggested to get it installed (probably a few cents)
They do it onn all their cars by default. 
It looks like 928s use it but Porsche does not include it on a 944. It has 
a 928 part number.

Pardon the ASCII graphics!

While you have the head/EM out you might want to check the LBS cover for leaks.
The bugger will not come off. You can get all bolts off except one that hits
the EM. How do I know? Guess what I did this weekend?

Hope this helps!

that I have overlooked that possibly a current C4 owner (or previous
owner) can think of to avoid any expensive mistakes.

The Car:
Red w/ black, 1989 911 C4; asking $34,900; 21k miles; Original owner; All 
records; No wrecks; New tires; Flawless exterior/interior; No leaks from 
engine or differentials.  I just can not find anything wrong with the 
car.  It has had two modifications: higher performance exhaust (not sure 
which manufacturer) and a performance chip ( I forgot manufacturer).

Me:
I've been looking for 9 months.  I have found two other cars that I was 
ready to buy but my mechanic said that they were leaking or had been in 
accidents.  I have a 1985.5 944 that I will sell soon.  I do all the work 
on the car except clutches, timing belts, that kinda things.  I do all 
oil changes; interior work; motor mounts; plugs; basic engine components; 
brake work (rotors & pads); etc.  I know the 911 is a different animal, 
but if any shade tree mechanics would like to comment on their 
experiences - I'll listen.

I guess I'm looking for things like: "I know there was a recall on the 
engine to head seals - you may want to make sure it has been taken care 
of".  Things like that.  Or typical problems of a 1989 C4 that I can 
expect to have to deal with.  Of if any one knows of any possible 
problems with a performance chip (passing emmisions. idling problems, 
cold weather problems; hot weather problems, do I need to retain the old 
chip, etc) I would be interested to hear them.

Thanks for any info.

87 VW Jetta, which is the daily driver. However, others may think of
it for any car.

I just noticed the front left CV boot is torn. Do I need to take 
everything apart to put the new boots, or do I just buy the split-type
advertised in JC Whitney and slip it over the shaft?

If the net wisdom is that the split shaft is not a good idea, then what is the process from removing the wheel to getting to the boots? Any 
particular pitfalls? 

Thanks in advance - Theo

Hey everyone:

I'm going to sell my 1973 P914.  Below are the specs:

1973 Porsche 914
Repainted Silver (original color was silver)
	(painted by previous owner)
1.7L FI Engine
Interior Very good
Body Very good (some dings, but not many)
Porsche Black 4 spoke wheels
Decent tires

Lots of spare parts (Including top w/sunroof)

Problems: It tends to lose fuel pressure for, what appears to me, no
reason. It is obviously a fuel gremlin, but I'm not experienced enough
to make the determination of what is going on with it.  I'm convinced
that it will be cheap to fix (from what Dr914 has told me), but I
can't seem to locate the problem myself.

However, when the pressure is happy, it runs great.

I'm not in it for the money, I just have one too many projects to take
up right now.

I purchased the car for $2k a few months back, and it has only had
about 300 troubleshooting and transportation miles put on it since
then.  I really don't want to sell it, but like I said, too many
projcets, too little time...

Please e-mail me with questions or perhaps offers. (since I'm currently
in digest mode)

Thanks,

Mike

After 90k mine went on my '88 44S. Although it's a different exhaust, it's 
similiar enough to comment. Over the years, different people have commented 
that the stock exhaust is engineered to complement the car so well that it's 
one of the stock items that you would normally not want to change. I can't 
recall the exact dollars but a new exhaust was about $700 and no one made a 
"OEM style" for the S because of it's limited production. I found a salvage 
(I forget where but can check) for about $250. I now have 120k on the car 
and it's working fine (I'm right at the break even point so if it fails and 
I need to get another $250 salvage, it's still cheaper than buying a new 
one).

BTW, I used the existing rubber hangers and they're still OK but I did 
change the ring between the exhaust and cat (~$12 for the OEM ring)

Fellow Pfiles and Distinguished PCA Members,

Just pulled into the parking lot at the office.  Beautiful 70 deg day here in

Anyway, as I was stopped at a traffic light I hear this whining noise that turns
into a grinding noise apparently from the clutch.

I make my turn, try to shift into 2nd and the clutch goes to the floor. 
(no more whining or grinding)

Sounds like a throw-out bearing to me.  Anyone ever had this happen? 
Pcar is '79SC.  If so, how long does it take to change and does anyone know
of a good source for clutch, bearing, etc.

I'm getting ready to freshen up the 022 cast iron distributor for my 
912. The shim kit from Stoddards has a few parts that were NOT in 
the distributor when I took it apart. 

One 1 inch OD (outside diameter) brown fiber washer

One 3/4 inch OD green fiber washer

Four felt disks, two 1/3 inch, two slightly larger

Two small C-clips

One larger C-clip

I'm also wondering how to use the shims. I assume that I should shim 
between the drive gear and the drive shaft bushing to keep the

My experience with Ansa on a couple cars (not Porsche) in New England is 
that they rust about twice as fast as stock exhaust systems. And that is

are. I would stay away from Ansa particularly in the rust-belt.

Could you elaborate on this procedure?  I know you had posted a similar
message last year, and I did attempt to bleed the proportioning valve,
although I'm not clear on what you mean by making the valve move.  I
would think that it would be hard to get that amount of pressure with
a loose nut, and even if you did you would spray fluid at ridiculous
speed.  They should make a bleeder you could insert inline.  Anybody
know what the inside of one of these valves looks like?

I have had mixed success with the split boots. The difference in effort is 
not so great that I would just do it right. You just need to remove the 
drive shaft by taking off the axle nut and the six hex screws which hold the 
end at the transaxle. You should loosen the axle nut before jacking up the 
car because it is large and on tight. Also, don't put the car back down on 
the wheels without the axle in because you can damage the wheel bearings. 
The CV joint can be removed by taking off a circlip and hitting the end of 
the axle with a mallet as I recall. The Bentley manual gives a good diagram 
on how to get it apart. (The only problem I had was that some of the 
bearings inside the joint came out when I was cleaning out the old grease 
and rolled under my workbench!) Good luck!

Subject: Parts buying.

I see the price for the 3.2 that my customer has for sale is causing a little
bit of angry replies.
No 1. Yes I know you can buy used motors out of Pana for $4,500.00-5,000.00.
But let me ask you this: Are you getting a good motor or is it stolen???? Are
you getting good paperwork to go with it. Who are you buying from? Where did
they get the engine from. Do they have a reciept?  For you uninformed
P-people, there is alot of stolen parts out there!!!! What happens if you are
caught with a stolen motor? ( Well, it was a good deal, but???? I didn't know
it was stolen.) The new scam is the chop shops are paying people not to
report cars stolen and selling the parts. When you run the #'s they come
clean, then about 3-4 months later, the car is reported stolen.
Guess what, your good deal is now the property of the insurance company. You
are out the motor,(or whatever), and your cash. At least you will not go to
jail. Or, what about motors that come from overseas? How do you run their
numbers? Unless you can get verification from InterPol how do you know it
wasn't stolen overseas.
Regarding 3.6 motors for $7,000.00. What are you going to put it in?
That is why they are so inexpensive. It cost alot of money to put them in an
early car. Most of the C-2, C-4's that come through the auctions are not
getting rebuilt. With a salvage title,  it is getting harder and harder to
get a loan on these cars.  Before anyone else e-mails me back saying that
$7,000.00 is crazy, please think about what is going on in the market. When
it sounds to good to be true, it usally is. I run a salvage yard for a
living. I have seen and heard it all. 
I hope my little message keeps someone out of trouble.

Hi Lou,

>What I'm trying to say, is that if the oil cooler seals are bad, you might

You don't need to remove the exhuast header or the engine head to
reseal the oil/water heat exchanger.  It's icky, and you do it from under
the car, but there you go.  (I assume by HG you are referring to the
head gasket.)

If you're going to do the work yourself, treat yourself to the special
line-up tool for the oil pressure relief valve.  Through MY86, it's
p/n 000.721.921.50 and lists for $22.35.  From MY87 on, it's 000.721.926.21
and lists for $18.85.  Also consider replacing the rear o-ring on the
relief valve while you have it out.

>Next, the oil seals. I too, replaced the oil seal on all 3 cams. Watch out 
for
>the lower BS. The shaft rotates in the opposite direction of the other two.
>There is a special lower seal (they have little arrows showing rotation).

These radial oil seals come in two sizes, depending on the application.
For the lower balance shaft, you want the 30 x 48 mm part, 999.113.281.40.
For the upper balance shaft, it's the 30 x 47 mm part, 999.113.282.40.
There is of course a special tool for tamping them into place.  However,
if you lube the edges and work *slowly* with a drift, you should be OK.

This is correct for the eight-valve 944's.  There is an inner gasket, some
sort of clear material, 944.105.321.00.  On it rides what Porsche calls a
spacer but some folks call a "slinger" (don't have p/n handy).  And the
radial seal rides on the slinger.  The slinger itself is a wear item -- as 
it
turns within the oil seal,the inner lip of the seal wears a groove in the
slinger.  If you have an oil leak, and on removal you can catch your
thumbnail in the groove, replace it.

I'll second the first sentence, but instead of using a wire brush I would
recommend a metal polish (like Flitz).  If you use the polish, though, be
100% sure that it's all gone when you're finished (I wash things off with
warm, soapy water) to avoid any problems due to polish that remains. 

I've overhauled 22 calipers of various makes, age and condition, and I've
never been unable to "bring one back from the dead" -- it's really pretty
straightforward, just timeconsuming.

It's not the use of AA that causes cracks per se, it is the lack of use.

Like addictive drugs, once you start using Armor All, be prepared to continue
its monthly dosage ad infinitum.  If you ever stop for more than two months
(like a winter storage) enjoy the numerous cracks that appear in your P-car.

Protectant 303 makes a product that replaces the stuff AA causes to dry out
and it doesn't require many regular reapplications.


Besides those two red headed twins with the mustangs are really goofy

Hi all,

I have two 914 questions:

1. Our 914 has an old tired dashboard, lots of cracks, but we inherited a
nice new one with the car. With very little to do, (I love to tinker with
it) -- the car is reunning wonderfully -- I thought I'd put the nice new
dash in. Well, those 9 bolts are in horrible places. Is changing this as
timeconsuming as it looks? Anyone know any dashchange trick? 

2. Fred and I took the odometer zero-reset cable out when we fixed some 
wiring behind the dash. When we put this cable back in, it does not 
reset, it just turns. Never goes to zero. I'd like to fix it. No matter 
how much I push, it does not 'seat' right I guess. Any suggestions?

thanks in advance.

Well the 944 S2 effort is off to a good start.  Took a win at the 
Jacksonville Pro Solo (my second event in the car).  Locally, where I can 
compete with about a dozen National Champs, I'm scoring reasonably well 
in our pax class.  Now it's time for the fine tuning...

I understand that K&N does not build a filter for the S2.  Does anyone 
have a filter suggestion for increasing incoming flow?  (BTW, let's not 
start the K&N flame war/debate again...I'm a big boy and I understand 
that increased flow MUST mean less filtration.)  

Likewise, any exhaust suggestions?  A little noise would be appreciated to
more clearly help me understand when I'm exiting with massive wheel-spin
versus merely exiting, and a little more flow wouldn't hurt either. 

Finally, Jerry mentioned previously a whole slew of various tire sizes
that work on 944's.  How about 255-50-16's on the front?  (Just
thinking...)

TAX CREDITS CAN REDUCE YOUR TAXES!!!!!

Tax credits are a bottom line, dollar-for-dollar tax reduction.  Unlike a 
deduction, which reduces income, Tax Credits are a direct reduction of 
taxes, which is approximately 3 times more valuable.  There a four main 
reasons, why it is important for you to find out more about this limited 
opportunity:
        1.  Boston Capital has provided packaged tax credits for investors 
for 18 consequtive years.                    Tax Credits for prior programs 
are expected to average 15% after-tax annually.  That's an                 
excellent return!
        2.  Tax Credits are Prefunded and Predictable by Congress for the 
full ten-year credit period.                   They do not vary with changes 
in interest rates or fluctuations in the stock and bond                      
markets.
        3.  Tax Credits reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.  Every 
dollar of Credit provides a full dollar                 of additional 
spendable after-tax income.
        4.  The only alternative to Tax Credits is tax payment.

Dear Porschephiles,

This is hard, but needs doing.  I apologize to Larry Herman, and to Tony;
and to you all for my childish Public responses to Larry and Tony.

These responses of mine did not set the kind of example I am proud of, rather
th opposite, I'm afraid.  My public responses were a childish public ego display
entirely inappropriate to this excellent group, and I am ashamed and sorry.

Stan is my friend, and I am proud of that.  Childish displays in defense of
a friend do not honor such friendship, and Stan, of all people, needs no defense
before this group. 

The appropriate response to Larry and Tony would have been Private.  
Furthermore, simple statements of the fact that the messages  were rude and 
inappropriate, along with a dispassionate explanation of why, would have been 
appropriate Public responses, and might have borne fruit.  As it is, I'm afraid
that all I accomplished was embarass and further alienate good people who
merely needed some leadership.

Larry and Tony, I'm sorry for any embarassment I may have caused.  If you need 
an example of how to modify your behavior on this group, (and you do)  please 
take this, and not my earlier childish display, as an example of Porschephile 
behavior.

I am currently in the final stages of checking out a white 1981 911 SC Targa
(150k mls) prior to purchasing it.

I am wanting to get an idea of the experiences any of you have had with
similar cars, general running costs, reliability record, servicing
requirements (engine, clutch etc) and anything else in particular to look
out for (engine, chassis and roof) etc.

Obviously I am getting the vehicle inspected by a loacl Porsche garage, but
would greatly appreciate your input as vehicle owners.

Do you have details of the options (and if possible code numbers for these)
available on this model.  The car , has 16" white Fuchs wheels, black
all-rubber tail and a chin spoiler at the front.  Does this mean it is has
the sport option?  What else does the sport option include (shocks etc)?

TIA

P.S.  What's all this talk about Subarus? I have a Legacy RS-RA which goes
well, ~250bhp, Gp.N susp, 4WD, LSD etc. etc., boxer engine makes it the next
best thing to a Porsche.  But not for long, it's on its way out...

Subject: 944 smooth acceleration.

Hi again,
	Well even though the infamous 944 is now being taken out and about, I have 
noticed that the throttle response is not what I think it should be.  When 
cruising, if some acceleration is required the response is distinctly lacking, in 
the sense that the throttle needs to be depressed a long way before the car will 
speed up.  It is almost as if it holds back when the throttle is operated a little 
way.  Could this be an indication of a mass air flow sensor fault?  Changing the 
air filter has made no effect, and I am just about to replace the Bosch platinum 
plugs with splitfires, which I have been told are much better.
	Any way of checking for vacuum leaks using the mpg indicator?  Any other 
ideas/comments?

Subject: Exotic, expensive C.V. Joints

I've just come accross a mystery that perhaps someone can help solve:

Some rather exotic sounding C.V. joints just became available in the
aftermarket. The Porsche part number for these C.V. joints is 959 332 034 00.
As the number "959" is part of the part number, and since these joints are
VERY expensive, I'm wondering if these are really 959 C.V. joints, and what
people are using them for.

As far as I know, most of the people club racing 911s use the complete turbo
axles, as the C.V. joints are stronger than regular 911s, but are these "959"
joints stronger still?

They are made bu Lobro, with a Lobro part number of 7 153 21 01 10 001, and
seem to be aquired in very large quantities by a handful of "racing" shops
and/or parts suppliers. 

Does anyone know what the heck these things are????

From: CarcareSp@aol.com
Subject: Re: Armour All et Al

Dave queried the advisibilty of using Armour All ( or other silicone based
products)

The problems associated  with silicone based products may be broken down into
the two catagories of usage,  tires and vinyl:

1. Tires/Rubber Trim:  There are two main degrading agents that attack tires.
 They are UV light waves and ozone.  Both of these attack the long
hydrocarbon chains of the rubber and by breaking these chemical bonds,
shorten the molecules with resulting loss of elasticity and other problems.
 Tire manufacturers add two primary sacrificial protectants to the rubber.
 To protect against UV, they add carbon black.  This is why tires don't come
in designer colors to match your paint. The carbon black will turn white/gray
as it absorbs the UV and dissipates the energy as heat. Thus the basis of
rubber parts turning gray as they age.  To protect against ozone, tire
manufacturers add a wax based sacrificial protectant.  The ozone
attacks the wax and depletes it.  As the tire rolls, additional wax is forced
to the surface of the tire.  This is referred to as "blooming".  This
blooming refreshes the surface wax protectant.  A tire that has not been
flexed will have the wax depleted by the ozone and thus begin to degrade and
suffer  "dry rot". The silicone oil in Armour All et Al may actually dissolve
the wax and be the cause of premature tire side wall cracking/failure.  It is
rumored that some tire manufacturers will not honor warranties on failures
caused by silicone based products.  I am in the process of checking with the
major tire manufacturers to determine the validity of this rumor.   In
conclusion, any tire dressing should contain a UV protectant to bolster the
efforts of the carbon black and preferably not contain any silicone.

Plastics/Vinyls:  The dash, door panels, seat backs, and numerous other
interior/exterior trim pieces are usually vinyl.  Vinyl may be viewed as raw
semi-liquid vinyls that are held in place by a solid vinyl "skin" (this
description is for illustration only and not a PhD chemical dissertation ).
 The dash and other vinyl parts of your P car are constantly bombarded by UV
that breaks down the molecules of the skin, allowing the raw vinyls to escape
(off-gassing).  These vinyls then may deposit themselves on the glass,
forming a haze that is difficult to remove.  If you have such a haze, it is
probably your dash that has decided to pick up stakes and migrate(back to
Germany?).  Silicone based products do not usually contain UV protectants,
and the silicone may act as a magnifying glass, intensifying the UV
degradation.  Silicone oil may also dissolve the essential oils in the vinyl
skin, hastening the premature formation of cracks in the vinyl skin.  A
quality vinyl protectant will contain a UV protectant and essential oils to
replace lost oils from the vinyl.  These protectants are expensive, so the
K-Mart specials may do more harm than good. Silicone also has very strong
electrostatic attraction which may be considered beneficial in that it will
tend to stay where it is placed, but will also attract every dust particle in
the surrounding three counties.

There are numerous quality products on the market.  If anyone wishes a
partial list,  or there  are any questions, or areas that need amplification,
please contact me.

Oh man, take off the head? I would say the easy way out would be to dump
some penetrating oil on the exaust man. studs/nuts, walk away for a couple
of hours, come back and ease those puppies off real slow (heck, there's
only 8 of them I think). Then, clean the threads with the proper size
metric die, and a little anti-seize before re-assembly with new nuts. I
really wouldn't want to deal with taking off the whole intake side of
things, then the head, just so I wouldn't have to deal with some rusty
nuts!

But hey, to each his own !!

Subject: 83 944, tires and dash 

I have recently purchased a 83 944 and need to get new tires within a day
or two, as one is in real bad shape from being very old.  The car has had
Pirelli P6's on it since new.  The tires are 215 x 60vr15 all the way
around.  My question is, what tires should I replace them with, and in what
size?  These tires will not be used for the track, but I will be looking
for track tires too, so I am interested to hear the concensus for street
and track tires, and if there are any size combinations other than the
stock size..  Also, the car has been Armour All'd for years and the dash is
cracked in about 5 spots.  Does anyone know how difficult it is to replace
the dash, and how much it can run$$?  If this tire info is old news, feel
free to answer off the list to: scottz@drg.com
TIA, SZ

  OK, now that we are done pounding Larry for having the nerve to ask for a
reason not to use stainless steel lines, I have a strange problem with my
'81 SC turn signal s/4 way flashers.  They die for some reason every now and
again. The only constant factor I have been able to determine is, the
working/non working is for the entire ride, that is, if they work they will
continue to work until the car is parked and if they don't work its the same
deal.  IE, took ol' blue to work today and on the way in, they were just
fine but coming home tonight - zip.  Turn the car off and on - no
difference. Push the 4 way button and nothing.  They have been know not to
work for days and then, as if by magic, start working again and stay that
way for a long period.  Other times it's work today, not tomorrow, and ok
the next.

My 911 came without an alarm key so I took the lock out
and dropped it off at the local locksmith for a bit.
The key he made says 'Italy' and has the inscription
WT 10 on one side and a large S on the other side.
In order to drive the car I put a resistor in instead
of the key alarm switch, 4700 ohms as I recall.
If you're having trouble getting keys made, drop me a

Friends don't let friends do Splitfires...Just say no.

Stay with the platinum plugs...they are not your problem...

Check the length of your throttle cable. Is there too much slack there?
Have you changed your fuel filter yet?  What are your fuel system pressure
readings? Do you have any other symptoms other than a lack of power?
What's compression look like? Is your valve timing *exactly* right?
Is there a possibility that your catalyst/exhaust system is clogged?

The answers to the above questions will get you started on the road to
recovery...

Good luck...

          DATE:      03/14/95
          SUBJECT:   Track Info Thanks and Oil Leaks
 
 
I wanted to thank everyone who sent me information and advice for
preparing for my first track event at Summit Point.  I was able to have
the car inspected locally and then breeze through inspection at the track.
It was a wonderful and enjoyable experience, and I could not have spent
the day with people any nicer.  My instructor was great, and we spent alot
of time after each session analyzing and talking though my mistakes, and
the correct points that I did.  It certainly does take a different
approach and control of the car, than autocrossing, but I can also see
some items that I can work on to improve my autocrossing skills, being
smoooooth, and being careful about following the line.
 
Now that I have been able to drive the car for more than about a hour at a
time, 3 hours round trip to the track, then 80 minutes of track time.  I
am able to determine were all my oil leaks are, and why I went through
about a quart and a half of oil at the track.  It seems my oil tank is
leaking.  I thought that the leak was from the short length of rubber hose
that leads off the bottom of the tank.  But, I think it is from the
backside where the wire for the oil level sender connect, since there
seems to be oil all around the tank.  After I round up a 36mm wrench, I
can get the oil tank off the car.
 
Would the sender be the problem?  The top oil line, and breather hoses
don't have any oil around them, and the oil outlet on the bottom does not
seem to have enough oil around it to soak the tank, and I doubt it would
soak the tank at a level higher than the outlet.
 
I know that a previous owner had a shop replace the tank about 6 years ago
for the same reason.  Do oil tanks have problems with the seams leaking,
or getting damaged?  Being a 1972, the oil tank is in front of the rear
wheel, so it should be better protected, that was one of the reasons for
putting it there in the first place.

Subject: brake lines


With all the commotion over SS braided brake lines lately, I thought I'd go 
ahead and throw this in.  Eurasian Parts Select offers DOT APPROVED "Kevlar 
stainless steel brake lines with 10x's less expansion than Aeroquip-3 hose" 
for most models of BMWs.  It's a safe bet that they carry them for Porsches. 
 Price is $75 a set, but it should be noted that most BMWs take six hoses 
rather than the "usual" four.  So, if someone is looking for an economical 
replacement of their factory lines with the high-tech look of the SS lines 
and the peace of mind that comes with the blessing of the almighty DOT, 
these lines may be the ticket.  I don't have these lines on any of my cars, 
but I have dealt with EPS in the past and was more than satisfied with their 
service.  Of course, YMMV.

I'm doing some heavy duty rust repair that will require welding in

Does anyone have any experience with air-powered panel flanging tools?
I've just butt-welded panels in the past but this tool looks interesting.
It puts a 1/2" recess along the edge of the panel so that you can overlap
the panels when welding. Seems like it would make welding much easier.

If anyone has used one of these, I'd appreciate an opinion. The tool is

I could do a bit, wait and do a bit more.

Subject: Freeing brake pistons

 
Bob Spindel says that brake pistons can look pretty grungy and still work.
 
Yes, but only to a point. If the hard chrome plating on the piston is
flaking, especially in the area where it slides past the seal, it will
destroy the new seals in no time at all. Clean piston with
fine crocus cloth (this doesn't take off any metal to speak of), maybe clean
the bore likewise if it looks bad, rinse very thoroughly, inspect, and
re-use or trashcan as required. I make a simple arbor by wrapping tape
around a suitable shaft, jamming the piston over the tape, chucking this
into a drill press, and using just enough crocus cloth to clean up the
surface.
 
If the plating is flaking in the critical area, the piston is junk, get the
new stainless ones. Flaking at the bottom of the piston, deep inside the
caliper where it never slides against the seal, is still acceptable.

Easier but not nearly as good. Lap welds rust much more quickly than
butt welds, and are a bit harder to get looking good, too.

A little note re: the Uniform Commercial Code.

Based on my experience and the experience of a number of people in
the salvage business that I trade with......

If you buy that used part  from an entity that is or presents itself
as being in the business of selling used parts and you are buying it 
to use (paying the sales and use tax is good proof of this) then it is
your part regardless of its origin. 

If you are in the business of buying and selling used parts and the 
part turns out to be stolen then you'll have to give it up.

I trade in used UNIX workstations, test equipment, electronic parts, 
and whatever other stuff I can make a buck on. (wanna buy a used cray

It has been typical of GGR for years to cancel its local events because 
of rain while the local SCCA region contiunues to run its series in the 
rain.  This has caused come concern from SCCA since the dates that 
weren't used by GGR could have been used by SCCA when site use was 
scarce.  Recenlty this hasn't been a problem with more sites to choose 
from (though not all favorably).  Don't know the actual reason for SVR 
canceling its event.

  Hey Todd,

  I have a '73 911T that had a fair sized oil leak a few months back.
  I isolated it to the oil tank, and it ended up being the assembly
  that the oil filter is screwed into. There is and O-ring in there and
  mine was very brittle and flattened (yes, I did get a lot of space

Subject: Alignment questions + Seinfeld

Hi,

I just got new tires for my '73 911 targa as well as an alignment. The
problem is that the alignment mechanic couldn't get the  camber and caster of
the  right front wheel and  camber and toe of the rear right wheel within
spec on the Hunter alignment machine. I should also note that the specs on
the Hunter machine don't match those in the Driver's Manual, which are much
tighter. Is it not unusual that a 22 year old targa is hard to get within
spec after years of torsional flexing or do I need to get the car to a frame
shop? It's not that far from spec.

If the car can't be aligned within spec, is there a way to balance  out the
alignment by putting the left side out of spec but within reasonable limits?
Am I making sense here? What I mean is, if the individual numbers aren't in
spec should the mechanics' aim be to put cross camber and caster, total toe
and thrust angle within spec and get the rest as close as possible? Could
worn rear spring plate bushings be the cause of some of my problems? Well
thanks for listening, any advice or experiences would be appreciated

Dear Mark,

Dash replacement is relatively easy by following these steps:

1. Disconnect the battery and then remove the lower dash knee pad.
2. Remove the ashtray and, if easy, the radio.
3. Pull the three instruments forward. Remove the rubber gasket and push them
back through the cluster.
4. Remove the instrument surround.
5. Pry up slightly on the dash with a screwdriver and remove the two nuts
above the instruments with an open end 13mm wrench.
6. Remove the other nuts with a quarter inch drive ratchet with a 13mm
socket.
7. Installation is in reverse. We hold the two dashnuts up against the stud
with a putty knife and start with the 13mm open end wrench.

If you have pushed the reset cable all of the way into the instrument, it
will turn the numbers. Sometimes you have to turn it in reverse. The odometer
may never set the "tenths" to zero. However, this is typical.

Our appraisal of the particular 914 in question must first be prefaced by the
following remarks:




As everyone knows it is easy to determine the value of a car five years old
and newer but likewise very difficult to determine the value of older cars
because the vast differences in condition, i.e. poorly repaired collision
damage, rust out, indeterminable number of miles. Therefore one can only
establish value by directly comparing one vehicle to another and finding what
the market will pay for such a vehicle.

Since we at Automobile Atlanta have actually seen most 914 Porsches for sale
in at least the local market, we can place a value on each as it compares to
the other. The 914 is a part of Porsche history never to be repeated, is
highly regarded by collectors and therefore rapidly appreciating as fewer
nice examples are available. This letter deals with current market value on
the date specified.


The car in question is Customer Name:_____________________ 
Year:197___ Model: Porsche 914 Engine:  ____VIN #_____________ engine
ID#_______________  color: _____________.    The standard condition for
today's 914 is as follows:

1.  Repainted,  but immaculately, with no over spray.

2.  Mechanically excellent, extremely reliable with only slight oil leaks,
verifiable mileage just over 100,000.

3.  No rust whatsoever - even in the notorious battery tray area and never
damaged by collision.

4. Options to include five factory alloy wheels, front and rear
anti-swaybars, bilstein shocks, appearance group center console and chrome
bumpers. Air conditioning is of added value (some early models do not offer
all of these options).

5. Immaculate interior with minor dash cracks - radio inconsequential

6. The engine compartment would have all pieces properly attached and routed
with perfect battery stand and original factory fuel injection in perfect
working order.

7. The front and rear trunks would have original finish and be immaculate,

8. All rubber seals and bolt on trim would be in good condition with only
slight scratches and none would be missing.


Rating this standard car at 100 points, we only need to value each point to
determine the retail value of the 914 in question.  Since certain 914 models
are more popular than other, the per point value would be higher.  This
particular model a Year:____________ 914  Engine:_____________ rates $_____
per point.  Therefore the retail value of the standard 914 of this model is
$____________

Bill,

Some time ago I had a smilar problem on my '70 911E. The condition was
sporadic and hard to trace. A friend of mine had similar symptoms but thought
it was probably a loose connection. Sometimes blinkers would work, or one
side would not work, or flashers, etc.,  etc.. Not long after discussing the
problem, his 911 had a dash fire. The culprit was the headlight switch.

I took my 911 down to the P shop, I asked them to inspect the headlight switch
. I described the symptoms and then what happened to our friends car. At
first they laughed, it was a one in a thousand chance that the switch could
cause the problem. I insisted that they inspect the switch and any other
electrical relays. 

When I went to pick up my car, the manager said he wanted to apologize. When
I asked for what, he handed me a headlight switch. The switch had already
started to go, he said he was surprised I had not had a dash fire already.
They could not find any other electrical components that needed replacement -
only the headlight switch!

Once the switch was replaced, the symptoms disappeared.

This may not be the problem with your 911 - but do not rule it out! 

Good Luck!!

Hi All,

My '66 912 is almost done (Finally!) and its time to prepare for a
test drive.  The car hasnt been DRIVEN in 17 years, the motor was
last RUN about 3+ years ago ( used separate gas tank/pump to carbs to
avoid gunk everywhere but in the carbs).

Is there a type of oil I should use to put the first few miles on
since its been so long?  As you can see from my list below, everything
has been touched, taken apart, rebuilt/repainted/repaired.  I guess I'm
worried that having taken virtually everything apart that 
maybe there's a method to checking the car out?  I already plan
on spending a day after driving it a few miles to re-tork everything
just to be sure I didnt miss anything or something came loose.

I'm gonna start the brake bleeding, start engine phase this month.

I'd appreciate any insights/horror stories to avoid....

Subject: 911 Test Drive

Hi Hal,

Yesterday I test drove an 85 911 Carerra. The place, Power Motors in Rosyln,
had some pretty interesting cars. They are a used car dealership,
specializing in hi-line cars. In the showroom they had a few Ferarri's, and
of course, some Porsches. I wanted to see an 85 911 Targa that was listed in
the paper, so the salesman took me to the back garage, where the car was
located. In there were a lot of very nice cars. One was a Dodge Viper, and
another was 69-70 Dodge Challenger with a 426 Hemi. That car was really cool.
It was Plum Crazy, with white leather interior, and a pistol grip shift
lever. It had the typical Dodge sport wheels, and 60ish tires. I didn't find
out how much they wanted for it.

After waiting for the salesman to move a few cars to get the Porsche out, we
took it for a drive. I have to say that I very dissapointed in the car. I
don't know if there was something wrong with this particular car, or if it
was indicative of 911's in general. This car had 16,500 miles on the odo, and
was very clean. The interior was in very good condition, but certain things
surprised me. The floor mat was worn out under the drivers foot position.
Other parts of the interior looked to be worn more than a 16,500 mileage car
should be. I don't know if the odo was turned back, or that was just the way
it was. 

Anyway, the car was difficult to drive. The clutch was not hydraulic, and had
a very heavy feel. The shift lever had an unbelievably long throw, and it was
difficult to find the gears, third especially. It also ground going into
first if I was not at a dead stop (synchros perhaps?). The car also didn't
seem that fast. The engine never developed the rush of power that I was
expecting. There was no comparison to the 944 Turbo S that I drove. Instead,
the 911 just seemed to pull the same, regardless of the rpm. The engine
pulled just as hard at 2000 as it did at 5000. I guess it was deceptively
quick, because it didn't seem to pull that hard, but I would be going at 70 be
fore I realized it. The handling was nice, not as hard as I imagined, but
very precise and firm. There was no pwer steering, but that didn't bother me
once the car was moving.

The interior also seemed primitive. It was difficult to read the guages from
the sitting position. The footing was also strange in the car. It had a dead
pedal for the right foot, but the clutch was located in sort of a tunnel. 

When I got home I went for a quick drive in my 944. What a difference! The
944 was so much more comfortable. The clutch was easy to press, the gears were
 easy to find, the dash was earier to read. 

If that is the way all 911s are, I don't know if I want one. The car that I
am considering is a Euro model, so it should have 30 more HP. That should
help. I will have to try anoter 911 to make sure. If both 911's are the same,
then I'll have to wait until I find the right 944 Turbo S.

Last year I bought my first Porsche, a  1987 911 Targa.  It has a car alarm
installed in it (from the factory I believe) which requires you to insert a
key into the inside of the drivers side door to activate and deactivate.  I
would like to install a better car alarm that will detect movement of the
car, etc.  Are there any recommendations? Have people experienced troubles
with any particular type of alarm with the 911's?  I live in Canada but do
travel to the States a lot for business if there is an excellent car alarm
that is not available in Canada.

Larry,
Just read your post on Porschephiles regarding why silicone based products may
cause your dash et al to degrade and crack.

What do you recommend?  Specifically, what product, why, and how much does it
cost?  If you're in the business of selling car care products, could you tell
me (us?) about your experiences that would help make a decision on what
product to buy.

Also, if this is your business, and I select a product you happen to carry, I
would consider buying from you instead of the local Pep Boys to show my thanks
for your information.

From the amount of communications on the Porschephiles mailing list I'm sure
that a lot of people are VERY interested in more (and more specific)
information.

Thanks in advance for any data you can share with me.  If you wish, send
pricing info for your products via a private e-mail message.

This is in response to the recent thread about oil leaks into the cooling
system.  From what I've seen, the discussion is based on 944's, with some
reference to 928's.

There's an article in the April `95 issue of Excellence ("944 (and 928) Oil
Systems" by Jim Pasha, Pg 109).  His contention is that leaks can develop
between the oil cooler (heat exchanger) and the coolant.  He recommends having
the seals replaced at the shop (2-3 hrs labor and less than $100 parts -- plus
an oil and coolant change).

I've read his article twice now, looked at my Porsche service manuals, and I
still can't determine where the heck the seals he's talking about are on my
928.  

As you may have guessed, I have oil seeping into the coolant.  A brief history
follows:  Changed coolant in December after 12 months use and it was VERY
dark, almost black.  Changed oil also and it looked like slightly used oil
(i.e., no discoloration, no rainbow effect, no slime or anything out of the
ordinary).  Therefore, oil leaking into coolant, no coolant leaking into oil. 
Okay.  Last week the radiator cracked and died so I changed it out ($519 at
Eurasian, for those who may need a similar replacement).  The coolant was
*slightly* discolored after nearly three months service ... therefore, a
slight oil seepage still exists.  This is bugging the heck out of me and I
want to fix it!!

Now, finally, my question to you 928 folk out there .... have any of you
changed the oil seals mentioned in the Excellence article?  I have no idea how
to get access to the seals between the heat exchanger and the coolant.  A
measure of my ignorance is that I don't even know *where* it is (the oil
filter and pressure sender are attached to the oil cooler housing according to
the article, but again this isn't obvious to me in the service manuals and
it's not obvious when laying under the car staring at the filter and sender). 
I think if I knew what I was looking for I could change the seals myself and
save the labor costs.

Next question:  if I change the coolant every six months (every other oil
change) and flush the engine while I'm at it, do I run any risk of damaging
either my engine or my cooling system if I defer fixing the leak?

Practical info:  1984 928S, 5-speed, no oil cooler in radiator.

Thanks for any info on this subject!!

John

My friend and I have just finished welding in 2 large replacement "patches"
in my 914 rear trunk floor.  We used both methods...."butt" and "overlapping
flange with the tool you described" method.  The flange tool made it easier
by a long shot since it was difficult to cut the replacement panels to fit 
the
holes we cut in the trunk floor due to their shape - which made butt welding
"interesting".  Sometimes the gap was 1/8"....oops!  Our "weave-welding"
talents have grown considerably though.  :-)

These 2 methods were discussed briefly last summer and the one concern
raised about the "lap" method was that it was felt it would tend to rust 
easier
than a "butt" joint since moisture could get inbetween the two overlapping
layers of metal.  Whatever you do, just make sure that the weld is complete
(no pin holes for moisture to get in the weld) and that BOTH sides are
covered with high quality primers/paints/undercoating, etc.  Apparently
POR 15 makes good weld/metal prep and rust prevention goop to help
minimize future rust problems.

Subject: AM radio summary


	A couple of weeks ago, I posted a request to this list concerning my problem
with the AM radio reception in my 944. It turned out that my problem was also
the problem of a few other Pfilers.
	To make a long story short here is our findings :

	In order to receive good AM signal into your radio the antenna pre-amp must
be properly powered (most 944s, some 911 and 928). The power to the pre-amp
is coming from a little black wire running in the same sleeve as the antenna
wire (work shop manuals are not too explicit on the subject .. at least the
944 one). Therefore, +12V must be applied to this wire whenever the radio is
switched on (most radio have a "Power Antenna" output that can be used for
this). Direct +12V should not be connected to this pre-amp since it will
slowly drain your battery. 
	For unknown reason the powered pre-amp is absolutely needed for AM reception
but is not required for FM reception (it is probably affecting station with
weaker signal). 
	This problems in most of the cases has been introduced by car stereo
installation shops not being aware of this different wiring in P-cars. When
installing a new radio
they just cut the little wire without thinking too much ....  if it was
connected meant 
it was actually doing something).

	That's the story folks.

	 I would like to thanks the list in general for the bandwidth and Mark Doyle
in particular for his good cooperation (+ other Pfilers who communicate their
ideas on the subject).

	See you soon.

Grrr!  I called Mr. Hudson at his 800 number to voice my displeasure
at his marketing technique, and I encourage you all to do the same.

He explained that he is a net.newbie, and that it was a mistake.  He
seemed reluctant to apologize to the group at large, though.

Subject: 911S Alignment questions

Howdy,

Neil Kumpers has a '73 911S targa and can not get the
alignment within factory specs.

> Is it not unusual that a 22 year old targa is hard to get within
> spec after years of torsional flexing or do I need to get the car to a
frame

It should be possible to get it close enough, even better than
factory specs. It depends upon ride height - a lowered car may have
too much negative camber. But in my opinion this is not a bad thing ;) .
What is the height of your front and rear fenders, and what size tires?

A front strut may be bent if the front camber can not get within specs.
I think the strut can be re-bent on a frame machine but do not know if this
is safe. A 911S strut is not cheap to replace!

>If the car can't be aligned within spec, is there a way to balance  out the
>alignment by putting the left side out of spec but within reasonable limits?

I have been aligning my '72 911S Targa myself for ten years, and am now
doing it again and removing my "street prepared" suspension and installing
new factory parts. I can now do the rear spring plates and re-indexing
not only blindfolded, but in my sleep (~20 times in less than 1 year to 
get it right and get the lousy Automotion adjustable rear spring plates to
finally work, and then removing them!).

There are many settings which will work OK depending on how you intend
to use the car. Let me know the specs that he was able to obtain and
I'll give you my idea of a good compromise setting that you can use.

You basically want the left and right sides to match. The rear camber
and toe can be further adjusted if necessary by slotting the spring
plate holes. You may need to raise the ride height if the camber
is way too negative.

Before telling us to get a life, you need to understand that there
are proper and improper ways to do things on the Internet. Sending
an advertisment, unsolicited, to a mailing list is not the proper
thing to do.

This guy probably sent to the same message to many other mailing lists
besides ours. The Internet is self policing at this point. There are no
"laws" to be enforced. At the same time, the Internet is not really
an anarchy either. There is a code to operate under and this guy broke
the code.

One of the problems the Internet is facing in its rapid expansion is an
influx of people (from AOL, Compuserve, eWorld, etc.) that have no idea
what is correct behavior.

An apology to Porschephiles for your offensive commercial spamming, would
not only be the mark of a Gentleman (don't aks me how I know), but also
might have the slaubrious effect of reducing the amount of (possibly undesired,

Subject: 73.5 911 Seat Interchangability with other porsches(944, etc.)?

I have a 73.5 911T Targa that needs seats (I have none!). The big buck
solution is obviously buying a set of Recaros. But before I shell out the
big bucks, I want to look at buying a set of used OEM seats.

Obviously, I could look up in the Recaro adapter catalog to find all years
that take the same seat adapter. I could then look in all the usual places
for OEM seats that are within those years (and so should be compatibile
with my 911).

But is there a level of interchangability of seats with older/newer
porsches (911, 924's, 944's, etc.) that could be achieved by buying both
the seats and tracks (and possibly other related hardware? Or am I stuck
with looking for a set of seats in a very narrow range of years for my 911?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Info on panel flange tool

 
Reid Zeigler asked about an air driven panel flanger.
 
Yes, I've used them, but almost never for car panel work. They're great for
making boxes and stuff like that. I did make flanged repairs to 2 sides of
my 356 battery box, but now I would butt weld it. I have also used them to
put a step in some hammer formed steel pieces which were later welded
together to make an exhaust resonator for a non-Porsche project. That one
was super easy to MIG weld. Flanged panels are indeed easier to weld (clamp
panels together with Clecos and just draw a bead, virtually no danger of
burn through, then plug the 1/8 Cleco holes when all is done.)
 
The problem with flanges is that they are rust traps somewhere down the
line, no matter how much or how well or with what you try to seal them.
Water is insidious in the ways it creeps into openings and then wicks up and
between sandwiched panels. The factory does use lap joints, and surprise,
that is where the things rust most readily, too.
 
You probably don't want to hear this but the right way is to butt weld
patches. If the factory used a lap joint (and they are unavoidable in
making cars), then you have to use the same kind of joint.
 
With care and practice, and the right kind of clamping, beautiful flat butt
joints are possible.
 
I would get a panel flanger just because it is such a neat tool for everyday
sort of welding jobs. There are times on a car when you just have to use it.
 
Eastwood sells one, I forget the cost, but you should be able to beat there
price just about anywhere.

We had to have the job done twice in the span of a few months when one of the

Give it up. You can't pull enough amps out of the generator to do this, and
based on recent findings in the vintage BMW world, the converters may place
a life-threatening load on the generator windings anyway. Besides, you
won't be able to *HEAR* the stereo if you are driving with the windows down

Sorry you had such a miserable time in the 911.  I have the same car that
you test drove (1985 Carrera Targa).  I had some minor modifications done.
The car is now putting out over 240 hp.  I can honestly say, you must have
driven a real dog.  I'v owned many high performance American made muscle
cars as well as european sports cars.  The Porsche 911 definatley rules.  I
would definatly try another 911.  I'm sure you will agree if you connect
with a healthy one.  As for 3rd gear,  I haven't driven a 911 yet that
didn't have a gear box that felt like you were driving a Mack truck.  If
your looking for power shifting, the 911 is not for you.  Good luck in your
hunt.  .  .  Howard

Subject: Re: 944 Oil & Water

Thank you very much for the idea. My car is an '84, and in talking to a
good friend who is a tech at my local Porsche store, and also a very nice
gentleman at PCNA, they both said, "forget it". However, both gave me some
very good advice on fixing the problem, and the guy at PCNA offered to fax
me several tech notices regarding the procedure (which I took him up on
since I have the original factory manuals, but not too many of the
updates).

He told me that to clean the system (after the repair) I should use a water
solution of "Shout" (ie. - like to wash clothes with). Apparently, this is
in a tech note somewhere from Porsche. Anybody have any comments on that?

He also recommended replacement of the coolant hoses.

He also asked me if this seemed to be a big leak (it's not), and have I
seen any hint of water in the oil (I didn't, both at an oil change and in
looking at the dip stick just after I've run the engine). He asked how long
I've had the leak, and I replied, "about 2 weeks" (and I do keep a very
close eye on my coolant on a bi-weekly basis, so I know it hasn't been
longer than that).

So, in any case, he replied, "In that case, I would not worry about
dropping the pan to replace the bearings". He noted that since the oil
pressure is usually higher than coolant pressure, oil usually leaks into
the coolant and not the other way around (unless the problem is not
attended to, then the car will overheat with the oil build up in the
coolant, the pressure in the coolant system will build up (from the
overheating), and the oil will thin out (again, from the overheating) - and
you will get water into the oil).

If any of this advice seems wacky, please let me know ...

Oh man, I sure couldn't agree any more !!!

Splitfires == S--tfires !!!!

In any case, up until now I have been using the Bosch plat's with success
(changing every 12k miles or in my case, four months). Last week I was
going to put a new set of Bosch's in, but something possesed me to try
something different! So, (this will sound really weird), I went with a set
of Champion Gold's. (alright, stop throwing food, garbage, and other debris
at me, I can hear all of you laughing)

I love these plugs. My '84 944 seems to really have a lot more response now
(even more so then when I switched over to a new set of Bosch plats). I
attribute this in part to the fact that I have new plugs in the car, part
to the possibility that this brand of plug is working better for me, and
partly (possibly) due to the fact that the electrodes on this set of plugs
might be lined up in the head better (I don't index my plugs, but I am
aware that the orientation of the plug electrode in the head can really
effect things).

In any case, I thought the Champions would suck, but they don't, I think
they work better (in my car, anyways) than the Bosch plugs. In the past I
have always stuck to the following rule:

American car = American plugs
German car = German plugs
Japanese car = Japanese plugs

Where I ever got this idea I don't know, because these Champions are
working great in my 944 !!!

Hi Pete:

While surveying my kingdom from my ceramic throne the other day I was
perusing an old copy of Excellence, the one in which your article on the,
then new, 993 appeared. In this excellent piece are several pictures, one
of which illustrates a very nicely crafted center brake light which runs
externally across the top of the rear window. I thought it actually
improved the car's looks if such is possible.

What happened? How did coupes get stuck with the basket handle meant for
cabriolets? On the convertibles I think the ET thing looked better than the
current iteration. Euro models of course, being meant for civilization, do
not wear this ugly appendage.

Finally I heard a rumor the new models have another solution. Any
confirmation of this?

I realize none of this is earth-shaking but I wanna know. Thanks!

No, not really, Dave.  There were only 76,303 when 356 production offcially
ended in 1965 (plus a handful assembled afterwards for special customers).
 And, the $5500 the 1965 356SC cost made it relatively expensive (putting it
in the highest category, for example, on North Carolina's personal property
tax valuation list for automobiles).  For comparison, the 1965 911 cost about
$5900.

It IS sad to see one end up that way, but there are a remarkable number of

   Reid, I've used the "Vise grip" type (not the air-powered type). It works
 fairly quickly, really, unless you've got tons of work to do it might work
 fine at about half the cost (not that $60 for the air-powered flanger isn't
 cheap...).

   If I thought I could get away with a butt weld, I would, as this must
 be the best weld to "hide" a seam. As far as the moisture...the factory
 uses blind overlaps everywhere (eg, quarter panel to door jam). I spray
 that "cold galvanizing" Zinc-epoxy where a weld will occur. This helps
 prevent rust and actually promotes a better weld.

The CHMSL (center high-mounted stop light) on the '96 911 Turbo is nicely 
integrated via a horizontal line of LEDs on the upper trim of the rear 
window. From the looks of things, the Euro model may don it too. You'd 
think with Porsche's engineering expertise and the anal-retentive way 
they pay attention to new headlamps and wiper arm mounting points that 
they'd come up with a better way to affix a CHMSL to their cars than that 
darn basket handle. Then again, maybe all 911s will adopt the Turbo's 
CHMSL...

Subject: Re: Tax Credits can reduce your taxes!

I can not speak for eveyone on this list, but I feel that people who drive
Porsches have a bad reputation as being stuck-up snobs that like to throw
their money around where it will draw the most attention. This is the way
people treat me after they hear that I own a Porsche.

This happend to me last week when a man, that works on a project that
shares lab space with the project that I am on, found out that I drive a
Porsche. I have known him for a few months and we have got along fine. Now
he makes smart remarks about what kind of people drive Porsches. When I tried
to explain to him that my 1986 911 could be purchsed for less that his car
from Japan, it did not make any difference.

People have a sterotype in their mind about Porsche drivers. I can not help
but wonder if people from this group attacking Mr. Hudson about his ad will
add to this sterotype. I find the best way to remove a sterotype is to do
just what people do not expect. For myself as a Porsche driver, it is to
be kind to others on the road, people on the Internet, and anyone who needs
help with their car. People do not expect a Porsche driver to stop and help
change their tire. Atleast not here in Dallas TX. My fellow co-workers did
not expect that I would help them with problems on the cars from Japan.

The point is that a little kindness can go a long way. The kind thing to do
about Mr. Hudson would be for one person (like Stan or Bart) to send a note
explaining the problem and then copy this note to the list so that all will
know that the issue has been delt with in the proper manner.

I no that my views are not held by everone, but I hope some other people out
their feel the same way. This is not a flame, but only a call for reflection
before action.

It is my understanding that the 993 "middle/high" brake light was suppose

attachment of it to the glass late in the production cycle and solve the

I would laugh harder at the "K-MART" Bosch platinums than the Champion
Gold. Stay away from the Bosch platinums with the ceramic-covered tip,
I'm sure the champions are better. Bosch has tried to pull a "BMW"

If you want to stick with Bosch or German plugs, try the Bosch Silver next

This ride height does seem fine. This should not cause excessive camber.
But your left rear may be too low, especially with you in the car. Put
your weight in the driver's seat area, roll the car, and measure again.
You probably need your left rear torsion bar re-indexed to raise the
corner to match the right rear. Corner balancing would be nice too!

>Left Front            Right Front         Hunter Range
>-0.1        Camber        -0.7             -0.2 to 0.2 

It seems that your right front has a bit too much negative camber for normal
street use. I have run up to 1.5 degrees negative, but this will wear tires
more quickly. Bent front struts may not be apparent when shocks are
installed.
I would guess that your right front strut is out of spec. Maybe someone
on the list will know if it is safe to bend these on a frame machine?
I have done this on non-Porsches.

Otherwise, you will have to replace the strut. Alternatively, you can
set the left front to -0.7 and have a matching set. In this case, you
will want to adjust the rear camber to about -1.2 negative on both sides.
Otherwise your car could oversteer at the limit. This will handle great!
(Note : Your current left rear is probably close enough for this
alternative!).

>Left Rear            Right Rear
 -1.1        Camber      -0.5                -1.2 to -.08
0.15         Toe       -0.24                 0.00 to 0.33

The left rear camber is a bit too negative, but may be able to be reduced
enough
if you re-index the torsion bar and raise this side. Try to get about .5
degree
more negative in the rear than the fronts.

The right rear seems to be toed-out which is not good. The spring plate
must be adjusted to pull the wheel forward to toe it in. I think they
need to play with the camber and toe eccentric adjusters more. If they
still can not get a little toe-in, then the hole in the spring plate can
be slotted enough to get the desired toe. But this is not nice to do if
you can avoid it. Good Luck!

Subject: RE: 944 Oil  Cooler/Heat Exchanger



John,

In the article, I was specifically referring to the 944 about the 
oil cooler/heat exchanger leaks. Especially the internal leaks around 
the cooler oil seals. The 944 system seems to be prone to leaks, most 
likely from thermal expansion issues rather than any latent defect. My 
own 944 had a leak, it was at 60,000 miles or so (100,000 Km). The 
present owner reports no problems at over 120,000 miles (200,000 Km). 
Most that are repaired never leak again. On a normal 944, the job can 
be accomplished by the average home mechanic without removing the 
exhaust manifold. The 944S, 944S2 and 968 will require the exhaust 
manifold to be removed in most cases. The power steering pump reduces 
access to the housing in all models. This is the primary reason I 
recommended using a shop do do the job for some models. 

Sorry for the confusion. I have but 4,000 words to get a subject covered
due to layout constraints. I will try to be more concise when defining 
model peculiarities in the future.

Subject: 911 Front dust/hub cap

Thanks to all those who sent me their methods for removing the 911 front hub
dust caps.  I ended up buying the 9165 Porsche dust cap removing tool from
Baum Tools (800/848-6657 USA) for $48.00.  It fits onto a slide hammer with a
10 X 1.5 thread.  It takes about five seconds to get the cap off with it.
 Like I always say, " You have to have the right tool for the job"  If anyone
wants to borrow it for their next bearing adjust/repack or rotor change drop
me a note, it will help me justify the $$.

Thanks Again,

Subject: 911 Caliper rebuild, low pedal?

Pphiles:
After rebuilding my front calipers and installing new rotors, pads and
bleeding the system (fluid change) I have a low pedal on the first
application.  I read in " Up Fixin' " vol VI, page 44 (Roger Chaney), that
after the caliper rebuild:
"You may find that you have a lower pedal at first application after the
brakes are not used for a short period.  Don't worry, this will go away after
a few miles and sometimes does not occur"
Well, I'm worried.  Has anyone had this happen?;  What's " a few miles" 5, 50
,1000?;  Why does it happen?
I think I used my quota of questions and then some, thanks, as always for
your replies.

Subject: Re: 911 Caliper rebuild, low pedal?

Low pedal after a re-build

There are two possibilities

1	air left in the system - most probable depending on how much 
fluid you lost, you may need to bleed up to 300cc's before you get all 
the air out.

2	brake knock off - this is caused where you leave excessive play 
in the wheel bearings, as the wheel bounces along, the rotor rocks 
between the pads, and forces them apart, so you have to press further to 
push the pads back in. This can happen after a re-build, because the well 
packed bearings seem quite tight as you turn the wheel. Grab the top of 
the wheel and rock - any clunck play, and you have found the problem.

Good luck

Subject: 911 seat type and headroom

I have a 1984 911 with standard (non-power, not sport) seats and a sunroof.
In my normal seating position my head just touches the ceiling.  (I am 6'
1" tall.)  At x-cross or driver ed. events when a helmet is required I do
not have enough head room for a comfortable seating position.

I recently sat in a 1986 911 with power seats (but not sport seats) and a
sunroof.  I noticed that there was significantly more head room.  Is this
because the newer seats have a lower seating position?  Or do power seats
have a lower seating position?  If the answer to either of these questions
is yes, what modificatiosn would be required to use them in my car?

Any other suggestions for my head room problem?  Would sport seats or an
after market seat help?

Thanks.

Subject: Right way to lower 911 ?

Hi guys, girls, and X400459,
 If someone here has time to answer a rather stupid question, this
is something I'm curious about:
Background: I'm replacing all 4 shocks and I'm thinking about lowering the
car just a little - say 1/2" since I'll need to realign everything anyway. 
Keep in mind that my knowledge of suspension is enough to peg the Ignorance
meter. 

Q: What is the "correct" way to lower a 84-89 Carrera ?  The common
method of putting in rack spacers seems, well, unPorschelike.
How did the factory do it ?  I see "RSR" struts sold (some with coilovers)
but these seem to be sort of racer thing.  

 thanx,

Subject: 'Philes Phund PHAQ

Hi Sanjay, and New members of the Group (who are wondering what all this
talk of money for a free list is all about...)

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1200 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per month. This volume of
traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1 service.  Not to put
too fine a point of this, this eats into Stan's livelihood, and, amigos,
that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable debt of gratitude.  The
very least we can do to show it is to take as much of the capital burden
upon ourselves as possible.

We are trying to acquire the funds to build the infastructure to ensure
the survival of Porschephiles independent of any member.  It's not a
type-a personality thing at all. Folks who have pledged $100 are those
who have recognized the high capital cost of accomplishing this, and who
have the means to contribute more.  *Nobody* has to contribute anything.

What is the suggested donation, and why?

$15 for Student; $50, Member; $100, Patron; and  $more, Dieties

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.  If you contribute $100,
you become a *Patron*

NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Recently, InfoWorld has a
comparison of two ppackage servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

But this is *not* some anal-retentive thing working here (well, that's my
story and I'm stickin' with it...), but an attempt to offer *guidance*
that has been requested.  Frequently.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  How about
*Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great* happenings on
the 'net?

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!

Finally, for you good souls who want to contribute, but haven't done so: 
The bank folks would rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

Howdy all,

I have a question for those of you having welded in replacement body panels

ever gone below 30 Amps?  I am deciding between two different machines
(Daytona vs Miller) and like the Miller more, except that it only goes down
to 30 Amps, while the Daytona goes down to 20 Amps.  Is this going to be
a big problem?

I intend to use the machine to work on my rusted 914s - so being
able to weld sheet metal is REALLY important!

Comments?  Suggestions?

Folks:

Sending mail bombs for any reason, no matter how justified, is bad
netiquette. It burdens not only the intended "victim" but all sites along
the way who have to pass along the extra traffic.  The best response to junk
mail is to ignore it, responding to this tax-break guy only validates that

Subject: Oil Tank Leak


Todd-

From what you say, I'd bet on the sender or a crack in the
tank.  When you take the tank out (which is very simple to do),
you'll find that the sender is mounted in a circular opening
about 2" in diameter, with a gasket, and is held by five or
six small bolts.  My guess is loose bolts or bad gasket.  Could
also be leaking through the electrical feedthrough.

If it's a cracked tank, good luck.  On the other hand, if
it's just a leaky seam, you ought to be able to repair it
with solder.  The tank is copper and should take solder well.

Hope this helps.

freon and the newer a/c fluids, but I didn't.  I also now know I 
should have bought a tank of freon before they stopped selling 
it, but I didn't do that either.  I just didn't think it would be 
worth it.  After all, how much could it cost to charge up a 911's 
small system?  I have previous owner receipts for $8 or $9, so I 
figured OK, now it might be $20 or $25.  Wrong.  Very wrong.

I just spent two weeks tracking down and fixing all the leaks in 
the system.  The car's been under restoration for a year, and this 
is almost the last thing.  (I say almost...is one ever done?)  I 
called a local dealer to see what it cost. $160 plus tax.  I called 
AAA Air Conditioning and Radiator Service (Isn't that what 
they're all called?).  $49 plus $22.50 per pound for freon.  Yikes.  
That'll be over a hundred too.

There has to be a better way.  Propane?  (Just kidding.)

Any advice would be much appreciated.  One more thing, is it 
really necessary to replace the receiver/dryer as AAA advised?  
Couldn't I just run a vacuum pump on the system for 48 hours 
or so to get
any accumulated moisture out, perhaps heating the 
receiver/dryer while I do so?  What's in there?  If it's simply an 
hydroscopic compound, the vacuum pump and heat ought to 
do it.  Anyone know?

Thanks a bunch.

        OK, I saw this '89 944 Turbo for 23,850 dollars Canadian. It's got
53,000kms and it looks immaculate. The dealer says that it never was in an
accident and never was re-painted but they don't have any records. So I take
the car to reputable Porsche dealership and they find a the compression
ratio of the leakdown test for cylinder four to be leaking. (They also said
the car looked like it was driven pretty hard)  Now I go back to the
dealer... he checks it out himself and then says he will rebuild the heads
and fix a leaking exhaust valve. Now my question is: Should I still buy the car?

Hi Philers,

   I just thought I would mention two items I've seen in the press lately:

1. The April 1995 issue of "Road and Track" had an article that detailed what
   10 members of the magazine staff would buy as a used sports car for
   $15k or less.  Three of the staff chose Porsches; two picked 911SC's.
   Wanna guess what the third one chose?

2. The latest J.D. Power survey listed rated the top most dependable cars after
   5 years of ownership (i.e. 1990 cars) and the 911 came in 12th.  It was the
   top rated sports car on the list.

   Keep up the good work, Porsche!

Low pedal after a re-build

There are two possibilities

1	air left in the system - most probable depending on how much 
fluid you lost, you may need to bleed up to 300cc's before you get all 
the air out.

2	brake knock off - this is caused where you leave excessive play 
in the wheel bearings, as the wheel bounces along, the rotor rocks 
between the pads, and forces them apart, so you have to press further to 
push the pads back in. This can happen after a re-build, because the well 
packed bearings seem quite tight as you turn the wheel. Grab the top of 
the wheel and rock - any clunck play, and you have found the problem.

Good luck

Pete Diffey

======================================================

Pete, there is also the fact that the piston seals are new and quite elastic.
 They can "pull" the piston back into the caliper a little after brake
pressure is released, causing them to have to be pressed further out with the
next application, hence the low pedal.  

Also, in your response to my brake question you were perplexed about the
refrigeration application.  I was refering to commercial refrigeration, with
30 hp compressors vibrating enough to shake a concrete slab, operating 24
hours a day, 365 days a year at pressures over 250 psi, and temperatures up
to 200 deg F. Not quite your household Fridge!

====================================================

Bob, as you are now learning, automotive A/C is going to be very expensive
because of EPA regulations and the Montreal Protocol.  The WORLD is involved
in this, not just the US. Your best bet would be to get the system converted
over to h134A, the new refrigerant found in most auto's today.  They might
have to replace the expansion valve as well, and you will lose a little of
the already insufficient cooling effect, but you will be set until the year
2030.

As far as the receiver/dryer, you are right in that you could possibly
evacuate most of the miosture, however the unit is also works as a filter.
 It is probably full of wax and other byproducts formed by the mixing of air,
moisture and refrigeration oil.  There is a small chance that it may not be
clogged, but to really find that out you must refill the system and try it.
It's not worth the trouble to do that, even though those suckers cost $150.
 Sorry for the bad news.

I posted a couple of days ago asking for pre-purchase pointers for these
cars and have recieved a number of helpful replies, thank you all.

I had it tested today at the local porsche garage and it came out pretty
well.  The only thing they pointed out which I am concerned about is a whine
(or maybe a chatter, although the mechanic called it a whine) from the
gearbox under load (>2/3 throttle) at low revs (<2000rpm).  Is this normal
or a cause for concern.

The car as oil pressure drive tensioners(?).  I believe this is a valid and
advantageous aftermarket upgrade.  How often is this done? Is it done for
any particular reason (other than to increase reliability/performance)?

Where can I find the option numbers on this model?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Let me guess.... a chocolate brown '77 911S with different size wheels 
and tires at each corner that the driver claims is faster than a 962C.
:-)
Nahhhh, just kidding.

It was a 914-6!
Speaking of which, the R&T staff member who has the 914-6 replaced the 
original engine with a 2.2L. Can you stick an even bigger engine in there?
Like a 2.4, 2.7 or even a 3.2L?

Of course. With all of the handcrafting and high quality standards, I 
would expect this. Who else, as a sports car maker, pays such attention 
to details as Porsche?

On another note, I requested info from Porsche on the new 911 Turbo, but 
there will be a delay in getting the literature out. Is there still a 
video available on the 993 or the new 911 Turbo? What is the factory 
designation for the new turbo? I believe the old Carrera 2 version was a 
965, no? So maybe the new 993-based version is a 994???

I would still like to see a Clubsport/RS/RS America version of the 993 
here in the US. I don't need leather seats, power accessories, CD player, 
etc. in a sports car.

Yes, RSR means racing in German. (and lotso money in any language)

For us non-racers, all you need to do is let some air out of each tire.

(Ack! NO, stop mailbombing me! Honest, I am not trying to sell tax-
free Bosnian annuities!) <vbg>

BTW, wrt the recent spamming, flaming, and mailbombing, newcomers to
the net need to realize that oldtimers often revel in the net's anarchy 
and live
by the credo "if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!" Folks are
much more brazen sitting in front of a screen than they would be face-to-face.
The net is simply not for the faint-of-heart (and that isn't likely to 
change in
the near future, either). Gee, I feel better having expounded that!

Since I am on a bandwidth wasting roll, I'll relate the procedure I plan
on using on the back of my 944. My car has torsion bars at the rear and
your '86 Carrera has torsion bars at all 4 corners, so the principle, if not
the exact procedure, should apply.

Porsche torsion bars have splines on each end to make the mechanical
connection. My understanding is that there is a different number (courseness)
of splines on each end which allows for differential rotation to give finer
adjustments than would be otherwise possible.

So, put the car on jackstands and remove the wheels. Go to one corner and
place a bottle/floor jack under a wheel lifting point. For the front, 
it would be under
the ball joint on the A-arm. On the rear it would be on the training arm under
the wheel bearing hub. Jack just enough to lift that corner of the car 
off of the
corresponding jack stand. The point is you want to have the A-arm/trailing-
arm at a static ride height angle. Place a dial protractor (the kind 
that have a
built-in spirit level so that you can measure the deviation from level 
in degrees)
on the A/trailing-arm perpendicular to its pivot axis. Then, with a 
little measuring
and trigonometry, you can calculate the angle change you would need to give
the desired lowering. Then, lower the jack and disassemble enough of the
suspension so that the torsion bar can be removed (details omitted because
I don't know them!). I would just remove the torsion bar end cap initially and
rotate it one spline, then reassemble everything (with fasteners just snugged)
so that the angle change can be measured (after rejacking the arm). If 
it is too
great (and it probably will be), then you need to disassemble again and then
pull the torsion bar out of its back spline, rotate it in the opposite 
direction one
spline, reassemble, rejack, and recheck the angle. Continue until the desired
angle is achieved.

Repeat on the other three corners and then realign.

Jeeze, that sounds like a lot of work. Does anyone know of a simpler method?
(Yeah, right, take it to a mechanic!)

I am sure that someone will point out any mistakes I may have made in the
above!

There are many ins cos which will not insure a Porsche. Most in fact 
will not if you do not have any "normal" cars insured with them.

My 2 week old C4 Cab has developed a dashboard rattle on the right side which

Does anyone know a good way to locate the offending site and correct it? My
experience in having the dealer investigate problems such as this is that it
becomes a frustrating waste of time.

IMHO, the new "basket handle" brake light represents an improvement over the
old "ET" version. That sucker cost a lot to replace when it was inadvertently
knocked off my '89 911 twice during washing. It's acceptable cosmetically

Well, it finally happened.  The trigger on the driver's outside door handle

surprise, they are going from $250.00 - 350.00!  Given this, I guess I'll
take the old one off and try to fix it myself.

However, if you have a good used handle for my '71 911 that you'd be
willing to part with, please let me know.

Thanks in advance.

To All Group Members.
Hello form England

I am a member of a English Porsche owner/driver/appreciation club.  I am also a
"Hobby Journalist" - not my main occupation. I am looking for research material
for a book I am writing. The book is to be a continuation of the Excellence Was
Expected story but not a copy as I realise the problems with writing such a
masterpiece - everyone wants to say no you got that bit wrong - not to mention
copywrite problems.

I am looking for information, Photocopies of Porsche articles and any
Photographs from the period 1978 to 1988. I am interested in all aspects of
Porsche history - racing and road articles.
As the book is more of a hobby than occupation I can not  pay for the articles
but am willing to pay for postage for interesting material - any material used
will be credited to the supplier/writer/magazine/book.

Any personal memories or thoughts can be e-mailed to myself at Compuserve - My
mailbox address is 100306.422@compuserv.com - I shall be with Compuserve until
April the 12th then I am changing to a new service provider with a better
Internet and WWW connection - PLEASE e-mail before then - I will rejoin the
group from the new service provider after that date.

On a more personal note - I would like to offer any help to anyone interested in
visiting England or Europe on vacation or any Porsche information not available
in the USA.


Yours

Keep your engine oil level topped up (check between each run) and you should 
have no problem.

Several track 951 owners have their rod bearings checked after 50 track
hours (about twice a season for the serious junkie).

Hi, fellow Porschephiles,

I can commiserate with Paul's experience.  I received my bill from State 
Farm for the 911 in December.  I had insured the car with them (along 
with all my other cars and house) and had received a pretty good deal 
(for a 911).  Well, in December I get a bill and then a letter the next 
day explaining that a *25%* surcharge was just arbitrarily being tacked 
on to my bill because the 911 is "a high performance vehicle".  I went 
ballistic since they told me last summer they wouldn't cover me if I was 
using the car as a high performance vehicle, i.e. Dirver's Ed or 
autocross or any kind of time trial.  When I pointed this out to them the 
response was "Oh, there's no such exclusion." (Got that in writing!)  
And, allegedly, they are charging the same 25% surcharge on cars like the 
Cadillac with the Norrthstar engine.  They say the surcharge is based on 
the ability of the car to accellerate rapidly.  Hmmm . . . couldn't be 
related to how much the car cost so they figure the owners have money to 
burn?

Anyone else have this "surcharge" experience?  Any suggestions where I 
can get the smae coverage and avoid this "sports car prejudice?"

Subject: Fuel Pump Diag

Hello Porschephiles!

  We are experiencing spring feaver in Central PA. 75 degree weather and
it feels GREAT! I have about 300 miles on my 66 rebuilt motor and no
problems or leaks! I think I do have a problem in the fuel pump. The other
day I noticed what seemed like a slow down of fuel while driving on the freeway.
It seemed to go away in about 2 min. After starting the vehicle the next
time I noticed the pump not shut down. So after checking to make sure that
there was no blockage in the feedline I disconnected the side feeding the
carbs and
installed a clear line on the other side (the tank side). If there was a temp
blockage, it is now gone. What I am noticing is the pump creating full
pressure and on the back side, after turning the vehicle off, I see a siphon
start back to the tank. I assume that this is a bad check valve in the fuel
pump. 

  Questions....

 Is my diagnosis correct? Is there "rebuild" kits available for an electrical
pump? Do you know where I can buy a Hardi fuel pump? Stodddard shows no
replacement save for Bosch available. Gotta wait till you guys in Sunny SO
CAL get up before checking my other suppliers.

        The lower plus is supposed to show the door handle screw which I

  At least my brother's '84 Euro model 928S (4.7l/300hp) has the oil
 cooler built into the radiator. Its just as the cooler would be integrated
 for an auto-tranny cooler, but the lines are bigger (like -12). My '79,
 and my brothers earlier '81 model had no such thing, maybe only the Euro
 model "S" had it. 

   $519 is a steal for a new radiator, used they run over $400. The OEM
 radiators are really crap, one of the few horribly weak points on these cars.
 Nothing should fail as quickly as they do, but there really isn't another   
 choice other than having one made...

I just have to bond with David for a minute. I purchased my car new when I 
was 22 (and my record was/is less than spotless). But Jerry, I would check 
with Allstate because if they will insure my then... On the positive side of 
the insurance industry, I had a Roll-Royce run a red light on Park ave. and 
do $12k, and counting, of mostly cosmentic damage (windsheild, airbags, 
dasboard..  long Bart like story ;)  ). Allstate paid me, her company paid 
Allstate and when my renewal came in, my premium went down 6% (a significant 
number trust me)

To weld a 914 successfully, you have to use 30 AMPS. The latest Miller (the
supercession to the old CRICKET) is the best. Below 30 AMPS we use TIG. It is
slower, but requires less heat and makes a nicer weld. Of course, supplement
the Miller with gas!

  I had the Stage II chip in my '87 944 Turbo and it made

horsepower (270 vs the original 217) but the difference was
more than just imagined.  The downside was the head gasket only

Subject: 911 Caliper rebuild, low pedal?

Pphiles:
After rebuilding my front calipers and installing new rotors, pads and
bleeding the system (fluid change) I have a low pedal on the first
application.  I read in " Up Fixin' " vol VI, page 44 (Roger Chaney), that
after the caliper rebuild:
"You may find that you have a lower pedal at first application after the
brakes are not used for a short period.  Don't worry, this will go away after
a few miles and sometimes does not occur"
Well, I'm worried.  Has anyone had this happen?;  What's " a few miles" 5, 50
,1000?;  Why does it happen?

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

John,

        I experienced the same phenomena on a 356 brake caliper rebuild.
The pedal was hard, but at a lower position in the stroke than before.  In
my case, it was the rear calipers, so wheel bearing adjustment was not a
possible explanation.  After a few hundred miles, I didn't notice it
anymore.  I believe the pedal is now as it was before the caliper work.  My
speculation is that the new caliper seals act as an elastic spring and
retract the caliper pistons somewhat when the brakes are released (same
EFFECT as loose wheel bearings).  This COULD be due to the fact you shove
the pistons way in during installation.  Perhaps it takes some use, and
heat, to position the seal on the piston in what will be it's normal
operating spot.

        Speculation, totally, but the "problem" went away.      Flames, or a
better explanation welcome :)

Subject: Prep for Drivers Ed and Freon

86 911 Turbo ex CA car
Drivers Ed prep continues, many thanks to previous responders. Went to a Tech 
session last Sunday and saw lots of lovely machinery, but all Turbos had air 
pump system removed and holes in heads plugged. As my air pump is defunct - 
drive belt and drive pulleys worn smooth! I decided to remove it and the rest of
the junk as I am told car will pass emissions without it, at least in OH. Joy oh
Joy can now not only see but can touch injectors, plugs etc.! Still trying to 
decide what to do with all the vacuum lines and solenoid valves though. Also I 
am planning to plug the last bit of hose just before the check valve for both 
head injectors and the Cat Converter inlet pipe as I need to get fully prepared 
to drop the header to get at the air injectors out of the left bank.

Reason for preamble is to ask if amy one can tell me the thread and fitting 
sizes for both the air injector holes and the Cat inlet pipe so that I can have 
all the bits to hand before starting the last stage of the job, and where I 
might get them. Automotion no longer carries the head plugs but suggested thread
was 10x1mm.
Any one have any experience good or bad with the above configuration or 
comments. I will probably run with plugged hose for a while, is that a problem 
or should I just rely on the check valves?

Freon/Air Conditioners.
My local supplier says that I need a license to buy 1lb. cans of R12 but that I 
can buy 20lb. cans for about $200 without. I do have a manifold/gauge and 
thermometer set up. Can any one tell me if the fittings are standard on freon 
containers. It would seem that with three vehicles to maintain and $100 a shot 
at the dealer this bulk buy is a good deal. Would appreciate your comments and 
if any one has the specifics for a top up they could send that would also be a 
big help.

Hi, Richard Hollander and Ken Rentiers.
 
Apparently the beancounters decided that since the basket handle was needed
for the center high mounted stoplight on the cabrio anyway, they'd save
money by making lots more of them and putting them on coupes too. I agree,
it looks dumb. But oddly enough most non-Porsche people I've talked to like
it.
 
Porsche is quietly phasing in the original roof extension. They don't want
to make a big deal out of it because they don't want customers saying
"Waa... Billy got a neato roof on his toy and all I got was this dumb
baskethandle. Gimme good spoiler NOW!!!"
 
The styling people designed this in for two reasons, one to hold the CHMSL,
the other to make the roof look longer and thereby match the longer/more
massive rear end on the car.
 
BTW, this thinking is also the reason why Turbo digital boost gauges stop at
.7 bar. The car actually develops a bit more than that, but they don't want
customers coming in and saying "I went T*D racing with my buddy Bubba, and
HIS Turbo gets up to .73 bar, but mine only goes to .72, now FIX IT!"

Paul,

Here in Southern California, most insurance companies run, not walk, from
Porsches. This has been the case for a number of years now . 

20 years ago insurance companies were hesitant to take on the Corvette's. You
had to educate them how the car was made. Now Porsches have gotten a bad rap
for "The 80's". You know, the  ill mannered jerk's who could care less about
the car, other than it gave them percieved power and prowess. Most of these
people were weeded out with the close of "The 80's", but there are still a
few lurking out there. Once they tried to tell me that it was the theft rate
for Porsches that prompted the policy. Just for fun, I would quote the latest
auto theft statistics, Porsche was somewhere around 16th.

I have been lucky, I have been insured with AAA for 25 years (boy that makes
me feel old). Occasionally, in the quest for a better rate, I have requested
quotes from other insurance companies. In toll we have seven cars, two are
Porsches. These "other" insurance companies said the would LOVE to insure our
fleet, EXCEPT THE PORSCHES! Well, my reply of course is, "No Porsches, no
policy". 


Good luck!

Well, now that the car runs (and, boy, does it run!!), I've been

me stumped is the following.  My headlights.  I get high beams, but
no low beams.  The lights are new, so that can't be the problem.  Here's

Fortuneately, I haven't been victimized by the insurance industry

In my case: New Hamster, 32, "single", no tickets or accidents,
 $1000 deductible => ~$6-700 every six months.

I suspect that the insurance companies take a much larger
"hit" when someone fender bends a P-car than they would
on a Chevy, which might explain some of their reluctance to insure
our cars.

Friends -

Freon is no longer available to "anyone" unless you have a license to
purchase it.  This became effective on November 14, 1994.  If someone is
selling it to the general public the fines can be heavy.  This is all
regulated by the Federal Clean Air Act.  Unless you are certified pursuant
to sections 608 or 609 of the above act, you can no longer purchase freon. 
The above sections include normal heating, air conditioning and
refrigeration mechanics (including home repairers that do freezers and
refrigerators) and automotive mechanics.  The test involves knowing how
various freons deplete the ozone, compositions of various freons,
different oils used with newer refrigerants (can you say synthetics),
recover/recycling/reclaiming procedures, general refrigeration
procedures/precautions, leak checking procedures, etc.  You are also
required to have at least a recovery machine if not a recovery/recycling
machine on the premises. 

Some of the newer cars have different fittings on the refrigerant lines to
both deter the public from messing with them and to isolate the type of
freons being used (less likely you'll put the wrong freon in if you have
to think about a different fitting).  Though, the freon containers have
the same fittings on them.  Snap-on tools makes a nice conversion kit with
the various fittings needed for cars and quick disconnects that eliminate
the extra freon going into the atmoshpere when you disconnect the hoses. 

Don't blame me for this mess.  I don't agree with it all either.  I think 
the ozone has other problems then just freon.  But because I have a 
heating and air conditioning business that I want to continue to provide 
me the income to play with my Porsche, I've had to get all the bells and 
whistles.  And it hasn't been cheap either.  At least their not messing 
with freon R-22 yet.  It will be here until at least the year 2020 and I 
hope to retire before then.

Hi Alex,

My 914 rear trunk repair was done with a 110V - 130 Amp Miller.  I don't 
know
what the amperage was, but we used the lowest (of the four) available heat
settings and set the amperage to around 28 on the dial (whatever that 
"really"
means).  One thing we discovered was that welds done with the provided
"gasless wire" (the machine was new), kinda sucked.  Lots of slag and lots
of burn-through problems.  We stopped after making a mess of a couple of
"weld inches".  After hooking up the gas and using regular thin wire, the 
welds
looked great, penetrated well, no slag, and most importantly - no burn
through!

The local welding shop I deal with has a "demo" area where you can weld
a few beads with a variety of welders.  Bring in a sample of the thinnest 
metal
you'd like to weld and try out the machines.  If your welding talents are 
lacking,
have the guy there do the welding for you to show that at least the machine
is capable of doing the job.  If it works, buy it and practice, practice, 
practice!!!

My company, PEMCO is really strange.  When I called and told them I'd like
to insure my just purchased 67 911 they told me they didn't insure 911's,
only 944's.  When I proceeded to tell them they already were insuring my 
88 911 they just mumbled about their rules.  I just cheerfully told them, 
"I know you'll insure it", and low and behold, a few days later I got the 
notice it was insured and the bill.

When I tried to insure my G Wagen I got a letter telling me they didn't 
insure grey market vehicles.  This took two firm but polite letters and 
somehow it also got insured.  

What seems to help is being insured with the same company for a long time 
and having a decent driving record, which is why I try to take all 
tickets to court, even though it is a real pain.  The National Motorists 
Association helps with the latter (unpaid advt).

I know where you are coming from I had the same experience.  All gungho about
my beautiful new car and no one to insure it.  Didn't matter that I had a
clean driving record and no accidents. My stuffy agent was dubious I would be
able to insure it and of course insurance is a prerequisite for registration.
 I was heartsick, but then investigated Leland West (advertises in PCA
Panorama).  Their prices are reasonable and they will insure Porsches but
they put a 5000 mile cap on the yearly use.  That also got to me.  Their
phone number is 1-800-237-4PCA.  Believe you need to be a PCA member to take
advantage of their Porsche insurance program.  However, my agent finally got
my 911 1985 Targa on my Aetna policy with my old station wagon and my SAAB.
 I believe the deductible on the Porsche is higher though, but I have the
freedom to drive it and drive it and drive it to my heart's content.....so am
happily insured now....JanetR5555@aol.com

Like everyone else, insuring my P-Car is not a pleasant experience.

In New York State (I do not know about anywhere else) you can take a
defensive driving course that will reduce your insurance rate by 10%, both
collision and comprehensive for 36 months..  It will also remove up to 4
points from your state driving record.

There are several private companies that offer classes (8 hours, all
classroom, about $45) and I hear that AAA and AARP offer it as well. Check
with your insurance agent before you spend the time and money.

Bob,

Re: the initially lower pedal height which got better.  It is more likely
due to misalignment (for want of a better word) of the pad faces
with the rotor on re-installation.  Perhaps you swapped inner for outer.
The lack of true causes knock-back, which makes for a deeper

Hello Porschephiles!

  We are experiencing spring feaver in Central PA. 75 degree weather and
it feels GREAT! I have about 300 miles on my 66 rebuilt motor and no
problems or leaks! I think I do have a problem in the fuel pump. The other
day I noticed what seemed like a slow down of fuel while driving on the freeway.
It seemed to go away in about 2 min. After starting the vehicle the next
time I noticed the pump not shut down. So after checking to make sure that
there was no blockage in the feedline I disconnected the side feeding the
carbs and
installed a clear line on the other side (the tank side). If there was a temp
blockage, it is now gone. What I am noticing is the pump creating full
pressure and on the back side, after turning the vehicle off, I see a siphon
start back to the tank. I assume that this is a bad check valve in the fuel
pump. 

  Questions....

 Is my diagnosis correct? Is there "rebuild" kits available for an electrical
pump? Do you know where I can buy a Hardi fuel pump? Stodddard shows no
replacement save for Bosch available. Gotta wait till you guys in Sunny SO
CAL get up before checking my other suppliers.

On a similar note:  I recently rebuilt my front brake calipers and the

(approx 1mm) than the old ones.  This was enough that I could not get the
pistons back in.  I eventually put the old O-rings back in just to get rolling

no leaking.

Anyway, I guess I'll get another set of rubber parts and try again.  Has this

        So how the heck do I get the fan shroud off my 914 engine?
I undid the screws and bots, and the front half came right off.
But the rear half is still on there tight.  I'd like to get the
whole thing off so I can clean up the rest of the sheet-metal and
that side of the cylinders and so forth.
        Please tell me that I don't have to take the fan off to
do it!

a couple of comments:

The new seals are probably thicker because they don't have any wear. You
need to lubricate everything with either a special brake rebuilding paste
or just clean brake fluid. You will probably have to press the pistons in
with a C-clamp, and it's normal for them to be tight with new seals.

The reason the pedal is low at first is that you have to pump enough brake
fluid through the system to push the pistons back out, take up the slack
from piston-pad-rotor etc. After that's done and you stand on the brake 
pedal a few times, it should be at the proper height.

Be very careful rebuilding brakes, it's one of the few things you do on a
car where a mistake can mean your life, or someone else's.

Subject: 944 Turbo aftermarket mufflers

I noticed that Alan Johnson Racing is now selling ANSA mufflers for the 944
Turbo at the incredible price of $159.95. Incredible, because the original
costs $525.00. Anybody buy one yet? How do they compare to original in
terms of noise, power, quality, and durability. Also, several places
advertise a 3lb carbon fiber muffler. Any net experience with this product?

 
re: query on chipping a 944TS 
Probably the most bang for the buck. I have an Autothority 2.7 on my '86
944T. The boost comes on early and stays on. Definitely reduces lag.
Supposedly gives me more hp and torque than a 944TS. Probably leads to
increased wear and tear and escalates normal maintenance schedules (new
clutch and brakes please!!!) I wouldn't do it again for that reason.
Mentally, the car always feels faster when you throw $ at it, and slower
when you get used to driving with the mod. Plenty of chips out there, some
with better reps than Autothority. Some places even throw your car on a
dyno and spit out a custom chip. No doubt is is possible for you to cut
your own EPROM, but a dyno should cut development time dramatically. I read
that chipping is so popular in Japan, there are drive-thru places to get
your Supra TT chipped. "Jiffy-PROM" anyone. Personally, I think that
Autothority is the most common (ie. proven), is CARB certified (I know you
can get an inspection anyway), and has a 30 day money back warranty if it
doesn't dip your wick.

Hi Bob,

I followed your A/C post with great interest as I have a '73 911 with a
"functioning" factory A/C system. Could you tell me how you tested your A/C
for leaks.  I bought my car last August and the previous owner had just
recharged the A/C. He had it checked out for leakage and it tested fine, but
he said that 2 weeks later the system hardly worked. The air does feel cool
for the first 15-30 seconds and then becomes warm.  Should I replace all the
hoses (they're original but still look good) and have new ones made or should
I find and repair the leaks?  How does one find the leaks? While I'm at it,
should I buy a rotary compressor that is more efficient? Any help would be
appreciated, it is starting to get HOT in Miami.

Hi -

Took me 8-10 calls to get insurance on my '83SC back in '88 when I got
it.  I don't understand this "we don't cover those" attitude either, I
mean, this is all supposed to be based on actuarial statistics, right?
Just quote me a rate that covers your costs for that vehicle class and
sell me the darn insurance!  Obviously there's more at work here.

Anyway SF Bay area 'Philers in this situation might like to give Mari

Subject: Re: Insurance Policies and Stated Value


Like most, I consider insurance a necessary evil.  However in the thread I 
noticed a discussion of limited use insurance and stated value policies.

About two years ago I read (and just went back and re-read) a letter in a local 
JAGUAR Club newsletter (we also ran it in our PCA region's newsletter).  It was 
a dissertation by a gent in Centerville Virginia who had a stated value policy 
on his '65 Mustang ... and the after effects of a major accident.  

After it was totalled, the insurance company told him that their stated value 
policy conformed to ISO Form E167 terms ... and that they were only obligated to
provide the LESSER -  of the stated value - or - of the actual cash value.
(Obviously the actual cash value is much less on a special interest car).

The guy launched a one man campaign against stated value policies.  He conducted
a survey of insurance agents, and found that less than 10% understood the 
provisions of ISO Form E167 (that the insurance was for the lower of two 
values).  I called my insurance company and tried to verify the letter, but they
said that they don't even offer stated value polices anymore -- "too confusing" 
(they offer a "Valued" policy which covers a pre-agreed on appraised value of 
the car.)

I don't know if the person still provides it, but he forwarded a 8 page document
on his experience (and the law) upon request.  If somebody wants his box # for 
personal use or for your club's newsletter - send me a personal note, and I'll 
reply to you.

Carlos Sham said

and Bill Smyth made a similar comment.

They're both right!  Since I sent the e-mail looking for help, I've talked to
Howard Adam at Porsche North America.  He did some research and called back to
tell me that the 928 does not have a sump/oil cooler such as the 944 (the
Excellence article that gave me the idea probably should have pointed out that
difference).  

Some 928's have an oil cooler built into the radiator, some don't.  Mine
doesn't.  

The PNA rep suggested that I have an analysis run on the coolant before going
any further.   I plan to do that within the next several weeks.  He also
thought that there could be some normal discoloration due to (partly) the type
of driving I do here in the Los Angeles area.  

Thanks to both Carlos and Bill for their responses ....  I'll post a note

I was driving my 66 911S last night when a strange thing happened.

I had just taken it up to about 70 mph and slowed down to about 40 mph all in
3rd gear.  

The dash started making a strange even ticking sound.

I looked at the Speedo, and noticed that it was oscillating between 0 mph and
about 60 mph.  The ticking noise was the needle bouncing off the pin at 0
mph.  

I slowed to about 15 mph and observed no change in funciton or pitch of the
wildly swinging needle.

I sped up to about 65 mph and the needle stopped acting strange and resumed
its normal "slight shimmy" of registering the speed +-5 mph.

So what happened?

What is this a sign of?

Subject: Re: Lowering your insurance Rates

I used to be insured here in CA with AAA (CSAA), but I got tired of their
intrusive questionnaires (this was when I shared a house with a couple
people), so I looked around and found that State Farm and Allstate had the
best rates (about 20% better than AAA).  

I chose State Farm because you can "suspend" and "resume" coverage on each
car if you know you won't be driving it.  Also, there's a (small, say 10%)
multi-car discount.  The "premium" for sports cars (e.g. a BMW M3, or
perhaps a 911) is an additional 25%.  _All_ the 914's are considered "not
sportscars" by State Farm ( :) or :(, depending on your point of view!).
Oddly, none of my cars are considered "sports cars".

Also, all the storied I've heard of people dealing with State Farm when
accidents ocurred were positive.

I pay $156 every six months per car for liability to the hilt but _no_
comprehensive / collision / theft, limited to < 7500 miles annualy.  No
problem if you have more than one car.

And, should it need repeating, I suggest you run screaming from any GEICO
solicitation.

Sounds like the Speedo cable is your problem.  At low speeds it is oscillating

normal.

So, I have a stupid problem?  My alternator light illuminates dimly at night
when the headlights are on.  I have normal 45/65 watt H5 bulbs.

The reason I'm concerned is because 8 months ago I installed a rebuilt
alternator from Vertex.  The rebuilt had a bad voltage regulator which lead to
other electrical failures.   Consequently, I now have a new voltage
regulator, new battery as well as several other new electrical components
mostly relays and A/C fans.  So, is this dim charge light normal, or is it an
indication of something sinister?

Bottom line, should I be on the phone to Vertex demanding a replacement?

I received the very same letter around the same time.  My car had been
insured with them for almost two years at that point. The letter
made it sound like they'd inadvertently missed the 25% surcharge when
they originally insured the car and that they were just now getting
around to correcting this matter.  It also had the statments about it
being a high-performance car capable of "rapid" acceleration.

Pretty aggravating.  Especially since I've had two other vehicles (and
one other Porsche) insured with them for years, and NO accidents.

Why kidding? 22% iso-butane, 78% propane, by weight, is a fine
replacement mix (although not clearly legal). Sure, there have been
those who point out that this is a flamable mix, but then so is
R-12 + oil (there is an impressive photo of a 12' flame of R-12 + oil
on G. Gobel's home page - check it out...). Not to mention the fuel
in the not-nearly-so-well-contained fuel system...

The iso-butane/propane mix actually improves the performance of the system.

Make sure your speedo connection at the transaxel is ok.  It is located at

Not taking care of the above cause can vibrate the speedo drive gear out of

removed and replaced my compressor and receiver/dryer myself so all the shop
had to do was evacuate (for 1/2 an hour) and then recharge, and leak test the
system.  The technician told me that I could have upgraded to the new gas
(134 or something?) but I would have had to purge the entire system which
would have meant <removing> condenser, evaporator, compressor and running a
solvent through them to remove old oil ($$$!)  Other considerations are that
the rubber o-rings need to be replaced (maybe neoprene replacements?) -
apparently the new gas destroys them.  They will stop making R-12 in late
1995 though - so the price is certainly going to go up!   I suggest you keep
on looking - there are plenty of devious repair shops out there - you will
find a good one though.

Hi dave,

Sorry to tell you,  but - there are 4 bolts (13mm) behind the fan that go into the
case.  

The good(?) part is that the fan really isn't that hard to take off.   The fan has a
pin on the back that makes is hard to put it back on wrong.  There are three allen
head or (splined head - depending on your originality index) bolts around the
center and a 13mm (14mm?)  in the center, then wiggle and pull.   If it gives you
trouble, try   filling up  the center hole with liquid wrench and leaving it alone for a
day...   

The other bolts that you have to remove are the bolt(s?) holding on the alternator,
AND the ( I always forget this ) bolt on the other end attaching the oil cooler
bracket to the fan shroud.

(you aren't doing this with the engine in the car, are you?  if so - I'm impressed,
it's so much easier when the engine is on a stand.) 

BTW - is there a proper name for those splined head bolts that hold on the fan
and the cv joints?

Wayne,
I'm not sure I would be demanding a new alternator, but from my experience,
something is definitely rotten in Denmark.  Check the output to the battery,
if memory serves me, it should be around 13.5 volts, anything above 14 or
below 13 should be view with suspect.  Check grounding strap for corrosion or
looseness.  Check cells of battery, if not maintenance free, for water and
corrosion.   Alternators fail less frequently than voltage regulars in my
experience.
Hope this helps.

So, I have a stupid problem?  My alternator light illuminates dimly at night
when the headlights are on.  I have normal 45/65 watt H5 bulbs.

The reason I'm concerned is because 8 months ago I installed a rebuilt
alternator from Vertex.  The rebuilt had a bad voltage regulator which lead to
other electrical failures.   Consequently, I now have a new voltage
regulator, new battery as well as several other new electrical components
mostly relays and A/C fans.  So, is this dim charge light normal, or is it an
indication of something sinister?

Bottom line, should I be on the phone to Vertex demanding a replacement?

After gawking at the high price of freon, I did some investigating
on what you actually need to buy the 1 lb. cans of freon.  It turns
out that all you need is a certification that be obtained by taking
a 20 question open-book exam from the Mobile Air Conditioning
Society.

I did this last year.  I aced the test and received my certificate
and wallet card within a few weeks after returning the test.  The 
fee was $20 or $30, billed to my credit card, and included the
study guide (about 20 pages), the test, and the processing.

Of course now the small cans aren't manufactured anymore, but should
still be available at some places.  As mentioned earlier, you now
need the certification to buy in larger quantities.

I'll get the 800 number this weekend for MACS, if anyone is 
interested.

O.k. I won't tell you that you have to remove the fan......

But there's no other way to remove the inner shroud. Sorry...

Keep this in mind when you re-mount the fan (if you do remove it). Keep a very 
careful eye on the clearance of the bolt ends wrt the fan hub oil seal. 
Otherwise, if you've changed bolts or anything, you could eat up the seal the 
next time you start the engine. Just a caution...

 A woman would probably pay a quarter of what I pay, with >ten accidents on
her record. 

In one of my many reincarnations, I managed the Personal Auto insurance
department for a major insurance company, and this experience gave me contact
and insight into a great many similar insurance companies all over the
country.  Even then, there wasn't a single company making money on personal
auto (several of them have since dropped out of selling personal auto
insurance).The situation hasn't improved, fewer companies available to write
insurance, so the companies can afford to be picky and charge the hell out of
everybody.  

Actual statistical experience showed that unmarried males below 25 had the
worst accident records, regardless of vehicle, so everybody avoided insuring
these.  Also, the category "performance cars" lumped Porsches with Corvettes,
Trans-Ams, Firebirds, etc., and the overall experience was likewise abysmal,
both in terms of serious accidents and thefts.

So, if you get an insurance application from a young, unmarried stud in a
fire-breather, well, you get the picture.

I was surprised to find that most auto underwriters think of cars as
necessary evils, so it was difficult to convince anyone that people who have
a great passion for Porsches, say, would have far better driving records than
the average. I think that the only insurer who recognizes this is the broker
Leland-West in California; unfortunately, this broker is very conservative
and prefer to insure only the so-called "stable" types--married, homeowner,
no daily driver, etc.

The only advice I can give you youngsters is to ride your parents' insurance
coverage if you can, get the highest deductible you can afford, avoid traffic
tickets (they're murder from an underwriting standpoint), don't commute into
 large metro areas if possible. But don't skimp on liability limits,
uninsured/underinsured motorists coverages, ever.

BTW, it is now widely recognized that female drivers are no better risks than
the male.

This may not be the information you want, but I'll tell you my approach. 
On my 87 951 I replaced everything behind the cat with a 3" pipe--no
muffler at all.  The sound is not very loud, which is not uncommon on
turbo cars.  The turbo makes a pretty nifty muffler at full throttle, and
at cruising speeds the car doesn't need much.  Results?  It FELT like less
turbo lag, but this is pretty subjective.  I did not take g-analyst
readings or any other objective measurements.  I've heard some say that
this should increase the amount of boost, but with the factory wastegate
management system, any extra boost is simply regulated out anyway. 
Obviously there's a big weight savings.  I don't for a minute believe the
claims that this could produce less power than the "tuned Porsche" 
muffler.  Less back pressure produces more power in 99% of the street cars
out there according to the dyno jockeys I've talked to.  Any findings to
the contrary would rely upon the computer reacting differently to the
increased flow, which is pretty unlikely.  Oh, and the cost with smooth
compression bends was $70 for the entire pipe, hangers, labor, and all. 
Mandrell bends would have been about $100 higher, but I didn't feel it was
needed with the larger 3" pipe. 

I'll be putting this pipe on my S2, however I'm betting it'll be a bit 
loud there and if so I'll be forced to add a muffler.

          In Massachusetts, the stated value policy is as described;
          i.e. the company pays the LOWER of the book value or the
          stated value.

          As far as I know, Leland-West is true stated value, but
          they have limitations.  You must be a PCA member, and you
          have mileage limits (2,500 or 5,000) but you also must not
          use the car as regular transportation.  You have to provide
          them with registrations for all your vehicles, so that you
          can prove that each licensed driver in your family has their
          own car and the Porsche is "extra".  You can't drive
          the car to work.  Also, you must usually keep the vehicle
          overnight in a locked garage.  If you only concours your
          vehicle, you can get a cheaper even more restrictive policy
          that only allows you to drive to events, and you must not
          leave the car unattended at any time.

          I carry liability through my Massachusetts company (about
          $800 per year) and collision/theft/fire through Leland-West.
          This costs me another $200 for a $15,000 stated value
          ($500 deductable) and 2,500 miles/year.  All this for a 1979
          911 Targa.

Last June I asked P-philes about a problem with my 911E transmission in that

It turns out a previous owner (it's always their fault) had accidentally
swapped 3rd and 4th gears when reassembling the transission. The transmission
was also misaligned (big suprise seing they couldn't put the gears in right)
which caused excessive wear on other components.  Reid Van (St. Louis) is
rebuilding the unit and I expect to have the car back on the road before
long. 

I am still looking for a single Fuchs 14" wheel. Cosmetics are not important

I would also like to purchase an original tool kit.  I looking for  Euro

             Several years ago, i owned a 1971 MBZ 300SEL 6.3.
Wonderful car... I had it insured at  a declared value of $10,000.
After a few years the car was stolen.  I called the State Farm adjuster
after 30 days had passed to inquire about a settlement. I was told that
they were trying to determine the value of the car so as to make me an
offer.  I came unglued and reminded them that I had been paying
premiums based on a replacement value of $10.000.  Their response
was that they thought that the car was worth more, but if I wanted, they
would give me the 10K that day.   "Of course it's worth more than 10K",
came out of my mouth and after some faxing of Hemmings adds for 6.3's,
we agree on $12,500 and they waived the deductible!!!!!    State Farm has
ALL my insurance business.

Subject: Weird Brake Problem

I have finally got my '66 912 on the road and I am experiencing a weird
brake problem.  The brakes seem to work perfectly fine for the first
5 miles or so then they start to drag terribly (I have to down shift to
accelerate down hill).  When this happens the brake pedal has zero free
play and is as hard as a rock (can't be budged), also the brake lights
stay on.  I have rebuilt all the calipers and replaced the master cylinder.
If I let the car sit, or fiddle with the plunger that goes into the
master cylinder the problem fixes itself till the next 5 mile drive.

Can someone tell me a good first place to check?

Thanks in advance,
Kotchman

I had a similar experience with State Farm.  My 1969 911S was declared
at $9K (which was what I had paid for it).  Four years later, I got 
stupid with the car and cracked it up.  State Farm said the car was worth
$14K and paid me that amount (plus tax, less the deductible).

From: PM9146@aol.com
Subject: Re: Weird Brake Problem

Kotchman:

In pondering your brake problem, 3 things come to mind.
1.  If the car has the original brake lines, they could be deteriorating
internally, not allowing adequate return of fluid to the master cyl. when
releasing pressure.  When they get old they start acting like a one way
valve.  Cure-Replace with new factory type rubber lines.  (I'm assuming this
is a street car and I wish to stay as far away from the braided brake line
discussion as possible.)
2.  Possible the venting clearance between the pedal actuated rod and the
master cylinder is inadequate, not allowing the master cylinder to completely
return.  This clearance or "free play" (can anyone really play for free these
days?) should be approximately 1 mm measured at the pedal.  it is adjusted by
removing the floorboard and shortining the rod going from the pedal to the
master cylinder. (it is threaded into the bracket which connects it to the
pedal and secured by a lock nut.)  
3. The pedal bushings are bagged either by rust or brake fluid saturation,
not allowing the pedal to returning all the way causing the same problem as
item 2. If the pedal feels stiff and will not return to it's stop by itself,
(check by pulling on the pedal and seeing if it moves further back) the
bushings are gone.  Cure-remove the pedal assembly, disassemble it and
replace the bushings.  Some people like the bronze bushings, but I prefer the
original nylon type.  We are in a fairly dry climate where rust is not a
major issue.  Here the most common cause of bushing failure is brake fluid
saturation caused by the master cylinder leaking fluid past the rearmost seal
ring indicating the need to rebuild or replace the cylinder.  usually the
loss of fluid is very slow and the tightening of the pedal bushings is a
symptom of this failure which allows you to often detect the problem before
the system runs out of fluid causing total brake failure.  The early cars
such as yours have the fluid reservoir buried in the contraband well and are
sometimes not checked for level as often as they should be, therefore a loss
of fluid might go undetected until it's too late.  The bronze bushings will
not be effected by fluid contamination so you don't have this early warning
possibility.  If you check your fluid level regularly, this shouldn't be an
issue.  If you have the floorboard out, you can see the rubber boot on the
end of the master cylinder.  (The pedal rod goes into it.)  If you pull that
boot back and have brake fluid in that area, or you have brake fluid in the
pedal assembly itself, the master cylinder needs attention soonest.

Hope this helps

maf,

It is true, 911s had the 25% surcharge and some were inadvertently missed.
An upgraded 'puter program enabled them to pick-up on the missed ones. I'm
an agent for the company and had to explain this to several customers, so I
know how you feel.

The surcharge was/is based upon a lbs per hp rating (I'm not sure of the
ratio). Several family type sedans, such as the Cad Northstar are going to
be dropped from the surcharge program at the next renewal. Included are the
Mercedes 400E and 500E/E500 along with the performance Lincoln.

Mat says, "...After it was totalled, the insurance company told him that
their stated value policy conformed to ISO Form E167 terms ... and that they

the actual cash value...."

For a number of years I carried stated-value insurance on my one-owner,
looks-like-new 356SC with State Farm...until my insurance agent called to
suggest I shop elsewhere.  He had learned that State Farm does, in fact, pay
the lesser of either the stated value or the value they carry on their
adjusters' book, and, in my case, that amounted to a difference of about
$3000.  He said it would be difficult to prove a value higher than their book
without an elaborate appraisal.  With his help (he evaluated the ratings of
the various companies for me), I shopped around and settled on a
stated-value, limited-use policy with J.P. Taylor in Pennsylvania.  It was
half the price of my former State Farm policy, and the insurance is written
by a highly rated Swiss company.  J.P. Taylor specializes in antique auto
insurance, and and is probably most familiar to owners of domestic antiques.

If you have a unique automobile, it will pay you to ask the right questions
when you shop for insurance.

$23,850 is quite a lot considering the red book value (check your local
library) is about 21,500. In December I flew to Montreal (from Halifax) to
look at a 1989 Turbo (80 K Km) and a 1988 Turbo S (125 K Km). Both were at
Porsche dealerships. I negotiated the '89 down to $19,500 but ended up
buying the '88 for $17,500. Both were in good shape and came with a year
warranty. These cars aren't that plentyful (only 40 '88 Turbo S in Canada)
but I would continue to look around. 

If you are interested in quite serious performance continue to seek out a
Turbo S and don't settle for a regular Turbo.The superior suspension and
engine are definately worth it.

The dealers probably still have zillions of the 911 Carrera (as it's officially 
called) videos lying around. You may be able to get the MotorWeek video, too, 
with a review of the 911. There is no factory brochure for the 911 Turbo yet. I 
just saw the first ad in a magazine, in the new Car & Driver ("Kill Bugs Fast"), 
in fact I think it was the first official shot I've seen - the spoiler looks a little 
different than in the spy shots.

I dunno if Porsche ships out the "real" brochures when you call their number, 
since they're not too cheap for Porsche - they're the only auto brochures I've ever 
seen that are in hardcover.

False.  You can bolt in the whole 911 front end, but not just the
brakes.

You can bolt on the brakes from an early 320i (solid rotor)
with a little machining. It's much better, with more pad area
than a 911S,and slightly bigger pistons as well.

Hmmm....all this insurance talk makes me really like our (often locally 
thought
to be rather horrible) "socialized" auto insurance in B.C., Canada.

Gender is irrelevant
Marital status is irrelevant
Age is irrelevant

# of tickets ONLY affects things if you get a few IN A YEAR.  You get to pay
a fine on your birthday.  But if you so desire, you can get 1 speeding 
ticket
a year for all 20 years in your driving career and it WILL NOT affect your
insurance rates.  Not one cent.

Accidents will affect you a bit.....often resulting in at least a 30% 
increase in
rates for the next 3 years....a greater increase will result for more than 1
accident in any 3 year period.

Car make and model will only have a bearing on collision and comprehensive
rates - the more expensive the car, the more it'll cost.

For the above example of $3500 (US)/year for a 993, a know a guy who
insured his Lamborghini Diablo up here for about $2000 CDN ($1430 US)/year
for 1 or 2 Million 3rd party liability, collision, pleasure use (drive to 
work up
to 6 days in a calendar month), no mileage restrictions, etc.  He's had a 
few
tickets and no accidents.

On the lower end, my wife pays around $1250 CDN ($900 US) to fully insure
her '91 Toyota Tercel ($2 Million 3rd party, collision, daily driver to 
work, etc).
So our rates have "collapsed" into a smaller range - almost like an average.
They also go up as claims in our province go up too.

Getting a claim resolved up here is usually a hassle though....but that's 
another
story.  But after reading your comments, I'm quite happy with our auto
insurance!  :-)

Subject: Actual Cash Value---When or NOT

Lets see when is actual cash value, ACV. 

When you insure your car with a Classic Car insurance company you are 
dealing with Stated Value Insurance.(SUPPORTED BY AN APPRAISAL) You are 
dealing with Policy/USE retrictions. This insurance is not for the 
Porsche which is used as the second car. This insurance is ONLY for the 
Porsche which is STRICKLY limited use and not normally driven to the 
store, work, bank, etc. The Porsche is usually used for some sort of 
club activities.

The same applies to the PCA Leyland West insurance. This ins. was 
specifically designed for the Porsche Club members, and yes, you do have 
to be a member of PCA to get the insurance, and is based on the Porsche 
as the third etc car in the family.  It is stated value with LOTS of 
restrictions.

But, if you do not drive your Porsche a lot and don't use it for everday 
transportation you can save a bunch with classic ( if car old enough) or 
with the Leyland West type of insurance.

The "normal" insurance companies do not write the same Stated Value 
Insurance no matter what they call it. There's is actual cash value.

Subject: Re: Freon

Hi all -

Since I'm not a scientist nor a chemist, I'll let others tell you about
the use of isobutane/propane mixtures as a replacement for your freon. 
Personally, I wouldn't touch the stuff with its flammability and un-tested
nature.  Besides, if it was that great plenty of air conditioning
companies would be looking into it and they are not.  Besides,
flammability is a big concern in the industry.  Other things the industry
is looking at while on their hunt for new freons is non-toxic,
non-carcinogenic, non-corrosive and have extremely low boiling points. 
R-12 had all these qualities and was once thought to be the perfect
solution.  BTW, the industry use to use ammonia as a refrigerant, but when
leaks occured plenty of people complained about the smell.  Now if they 
could only get rid of the smell.

With regards to the use of R-134a, the same restrictions apply to it.  You
cannot vent it into the atmosphere, it can only be purchased by a licensed
technician and it must be reclaimed/recycled.  Even though the ozone
depletion is almost zero, they still don't want this stuff in the
atmosphere.  R-134a also requires a new leak detector because it doesn't
contain the chlorine atom.  Old refrigerants could use a small flame with
a smiffer hose attached, but with the newer refrigerants, you have to
purchase an electronic leak detector (yes, around $150).  This one atom is
what causes most of the damage to the ozone.  When chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC/R-12 or other CFC's for that matter) molecules meet up with UV
radiation, the chlorine atom leaves and connects with the ozone molecules
(O3), it then takes away one oxygen atom and becomes a chlorine monoxide
(ClO) molecule.  Then when this meets up with another single oxygen atom,
it leaves the chlorine atom free again because oxygen then becomes O2. 
This chlorine atom then goes to the next ozone molecule and destroys this
molecule and the process keeps repeating itself.  I think that is
chemically right.......any chemists out there?  But let's not turn this
into another what's better in tires discussion.  Correct me simply if
possible. 

One of the problems with automobile air conditioning systems is vibration
and rubber hoses.  In fact, if you use rubber hoses on a R-134a system,
they have to be of higher quality and denser to prevent freon from leaking
or permiating through the hoses.  Vibration is a given, where on regular
a/c systems most refrigerant flows through solid copper tubing that is
brazed at all joints.  Also on automotive systems, because of the use of a
lot of flare hose ends (joints), there are many o-rings that dry out if
not lubricated frequently enough.  This is why it is recommended that you
run the a/c system at least once a month.  This allows some oil from the
compressor to pass through the system with the refrigerant and keeps
o-rings lubricated. 

If your system initially starts off cold but then quickly goes to warm, 
it sounds like you are low on refrigerant.  Better check for leaks, 
repair and then fill with refrigerant.

As far as cost to check out and re-fill your a/c system this varies all
over the country.  The most modern shops can probably do the job in less
than 1 hour and then you have to add the time to replace defective /
leaking hoses etc.  This includes evacuating the system.  I think most
shops hourly rates are around $55-70 per hour.  You figure the math. 
Freon currently has a Federal tax of $3.10 per pound and that is projected
to rise almost 50 cents per year until 1999.  Beyond that, who knows what
the government will do.  Remember, this is only the Federal tax. Then you
have to add the cost to manufacture (or in the case of R-12 end of 1995)
reclaim exisitng refrigerants to proper ARI standard 700-1988.  Now add
the cost of currently looking / experimenting with new refrigerants and
the cost of R-12 is somewhere around $9-10 per pound.  And that's
wholesale cost not the cost to the public.  The mechanic has to make some
profit on his "parts" sales and now you can see why some places sell freon
for over $15 per pound.  Some of the recycle/reclaim equipment can run as
high as $5000.  This cost has to amortized over time by someone, usually
the car owners. 

As far as self-service of your a/c system.  I relate it somewhat like the 
private service shops that can't get the new computerized equipment to 
work on the new cars.  That's the way it is!  But I can sympathize (sp.) 
with you.

Again, as in my original statement, i don't agree with the handling of 
the problem nor do I think that freon is responsible for all of the 
problems.  It is just like the air polution problem, they blamed the cars 
and now with the massive restrictions on these the problem has only been 
solved partially (maybe %20?).

I hope this has answered most of your questions.

Now this is getting interesting.  I got the same story ("oh, we

something smells fishy (I never heard of an insurance company doing

policies that they discovered this oversight?  Oh, and it happens to be 
on the Porsches.  Oh and it happens to have been discovered for everyone

Bill,

I always told my wife that the 911 was a "practical family car" - it has 
the back seats for the kids after all.  Any chance State Farm will 
through our 911's into the "family type sedan" category you mentioned and 
drop us from the 25% hit list? :-)  One question:  If the rationale for 
the surcharge is truly as stated in the letters and conversations which 
is the ability of the car to accelerate rapidly, how do cars with higher 
acceleration rates get off the list as family sedans?  I never heard the 
lbs/hp ratio explanation in all my discussions with SF.  Does this mean 
that actual 0-60 times are not used but rather this weight to hp ratio?  
I've been with SF for 11 years and have a great local agent, but I gotta 
tell ya, SF is losing a LOT of goodwill with this little "oversight."

Howdy Porschephiles!  Let me tell you about my 1972 914-4 Gretchin. 
Beautiful blazing red and nice on the curves.  But something's strange... 

	I pride myself on doing all the work on my beloved baby, but a few
months ago I had a rather nasty problem.  Zipping down the road as oft I
do, my right axle becomes detached from the transmission, sending the
engine racing and me slowly to the side of the road.  Being dense but
mechanically inclined, I simply put the axle back on, screwed the bolts
down tightly and went on my merry way.  Later I noticed the right rear
tire was rubbing against the fender well, and I then discovered a part of
the suspension was rusting through.  It then made sense to me why the axle
came off, the tire was pulling away constantly.  $600 of welding later,
the wheel is fine and was aligned, but then it happened again, the axle
came off as I was driving.  Unfortunately this time it shattered the axle
and ripped my clutch cable to shreds on the way down.  I replaced the
parts, but the axle bolts/screws still become loose regularly, and I
tighten them down at regular intervals to prevent breakdown.  But why? 
Why I ask?  I put in new roll pins and washers, even new nuts and I tried
Loctite!  What is my problem?  Thanks for any assistance or opinions!

Hi, Pete,

I don't recall the year of your car, but you may have a fairly large 
problem here...

In order to replace the firewall bearing, you will indeed have to remove the
steering column and its surrounding tunnel.

Ultimately, you will have to remove two *anti-theft* 
shear bolts (bolts without heads) at the upper support mounting point.
I have been fairly unsuccessful in removing steering columns (probably
due to my impatience more than anything else) without damage, so I 
have taken to leaving them in place when I discard a chassis.

I would find a pretty good mechanic, perhaps a dealer to assess the amount 
of effort involved. I would *not* attempt this on my own, unless I had
a much greater tolerance of frustration...

Good luck,

I seem to remember (years ago) similar symptoms from my 67 911S. I can
offer two possibilities. The basic effect comes from torsional oscillations
in the speedometer cable (whats that you say? speedometers weren't always
electric? the early 911 had at least moved to an electric tach). These
torsional vibrations might be due to a small kink in the cable somewhere 
(near the speedometer head, where there is significant cable to wind
and unwind). The fact that the effect only happens over a narrow speed
range is, I expect, a resonance effect. The second possibility, if my
memory is accurate, is that the early 911 odometer used a ratchet
mechanism, which imposes cyclic loads on the cable. If it binds, these
cyclic load changes could set up torsional oscillations in the cable.
For fixes, if the cable is kinked, put in a new cable, perhaps just
a new core (which is where a kink causes a problem). If it is the
speedometer itself, get it repaired, or, take it apart yourself and
disable the odometer feed (consult your favorite attorney first :')).

Sorry, but the Federal laws only came into existance because os an
International agreement called the Montreal Protocol.  This agreement is
signed by over 30 nations in 1987 (Mexico is one of them) and is to
control releases of ozone depleting substances.  BTW, it was signed in
Montreal and has since been amended at the London in 1990 and Cpenhagen

Fido makes more noise than my 951 with this pipe does!  Seriously!  As a 
serious autocrosser, I've had many, many louder cars.  For instance, my 
914 2.0 with a Bursch muffler, same car with 1.7 and a small dyna-max 
muffler grafted to a Bursch system, even a Neon with the muffler hacked 
off and a short down pipe installed in it's place.  All were MUCH louder 
than the 951.  As far as weight goes, I just put the pipe in the back of 
my S2 this morning, as it's going to be installed on it today.  The pipe 
weighs, I would say, about 10-12 pounds total, including all hardware.

As I mentioned, the S2 will probably need a muffler, unfortunately.  I'll
know more in a few hours.  Without a turbo in the system, it DOES get
loud.  A good example of this is shown by accelerating hard in the 951,
then lifting about halfway very suddenly.  The computer opens the
wastegate, venting the exhaust around the turbo.  This produces a brief
pulse of LOUDness.  But it goes away right away since you're not standing
on it anymore.

Probable cause: kinked or worn speedo cable. Replace. Be careful not to kink
new one.
 
The fact that the needle bounces 5 mph even under the best conditions is a
giveaway that something's binding the flexible shaft in the cable. It grabs,
winds up, breaks loose, grabs again, etc.

I beg to differ. I have never seen any company with better
rates than USAA. I've said it before here and I will say it
again: if you qualify for insurance with USAA (basically,
if you were ever a commissioned officer) get it, because
you will not likely find better insurance anywhere. Of all the
benefits I got from being in the service, I consider being
able to get this insurance the best (well, that and the
opportunity to travel to such garden spots as Rejkavik,
Riyadh, Seoul, Cold Lake, Minot, etc, )

Tracy,
You can benifit from my motorcycle knowledge of helmets.  Mail-order is the 
least expensive way to go, but you do need to try on a few to be sure of a 
propper fit.  You can do this by going to a local cycle shop and try a few on.
Denis Kirk Mail order provides  a good selection of helemts for a good price.
I do not recomend the polycarbonate helments.  They do not provide good 
protection as compared to the Kevlar fiber helmets ( I own a kevlar helmet mfg. 
by BEIFFE and am very pleased with the style, fit and light weight)  You may 
also need to check the regulation at the track that you will be running at.  
Some only require a Snell rated helmet while others insist you purchase a Bell 
Helmet.  I previously owned a Bell and found the design to be heavy and 
cumbersome.
The best way to decide is look around, try some on and keep your eye on the 
saftey rating.

     Tracy:
        I don't think it's a swell idea to buy a helmet by mail-order. The 
     fit is pretty critical in a helmet, and they don't all feel the same. 
     When I purchased mine, I must have tried a dozen different models on 
     before I made my selection. And I made sure to wear the helmet I liked 
     for a good 10 minutes or so to see how it felt. (If you wear glasses, 
     this will help you find out if the helmet has adequate ventillation or 
     tends to fog up with the visor down). The only way I would do this is: 
     Try someone else's in your size, and if you like it, *then* place your 
     order. The two major brands I've seen are Bell and Simpson. (A 
     full-face helmet is advisable unless you want to look like Dale 
     Earnheart). I liked the Bell better, but that was just a personal 
     preference. I think it was something like an MR2, and I believe the 
     price was around $270 from OG Racing, which is in Manassas, VA. Your 
     prices may vary...

No, these are the same ones you would get anywhere, but since

These plugs are easy to tell because they have the ceramic covered center

I'm no Robert Bosch, but I think they are obviously bad, as the

I have a question about fuel pressure behavior with Bosch Motronics.
Fuel pressure on my car (84 Porsche 944) is dead-on the idle spec

(e.g. 25psi at 2200rpm).

Subject: Testing a/c for leaks


Hi All-

Several people have asked me how I made a leak gauge to test 
my a/c system.  There are probably better ways to do it, like buying a 
leak detector as Lee Atkinson did, but FWIW, here's what I did.

First, I used my air compressor to fill the system to about 40 psi, 
and then I went around to all the fittings and slopped on very 
thick,  soapy water.  That's how you find leaks, even slow ones, 
in tires, and it works quite well.  It's surprising how even a 
small pinhole leak that might take a day to reduce the pressure 
from say 40 to 39 psi will show up as a visible, growing bubble.

Then, to be absolutely sure I was leak free (considering the cost 
of R-12, one wants to be absolutely sure) I charged the system 
with air, again to about 40 psi, and let is sit for a few weeks, 
every now and again checking the pressure.  After two weeks 
with no loss, I figured it was leak-free.  

To accomplish all this, I made a little fitting/gauge combination 
that screwed onto the system filling port, which on my car is on 
the compressor.  There are actually two such ports, and I don't 
think it matters which you attach to for the purpose of this test.  
It's a standard fitting, available in hardware/plumbing stores 
for a buck or so. I attached a $10 prerssure gauge to this, and 
then a female quick disconnect.  That way I could connect and 
disconnect the air compressor easily.  But you really don't need 
this little bit of luxury.  With this assembly in place, just open 
valve a bit (clockwise).  If there's pressure in the system, the 
gauge will read it.  Mine was empty, so I added air till the 
gauge read about 40 psi, and then closed the valve (counter-
clockwise).  That way the system is isolated from my little 
assembly and any leakage is from the system itself.  Every few 
days I opened the valve and checked the pressure.  Simple.  Just 
remember the valve rotation is opposite to what comes 
naturally.  I'm not sure all a/c units have valves like this, but on 
mine, its a sort of three way device.  Total counter-clockwise is 
operational.  System sealed and ready to go.  Whe turned in a 
bit (clockwise) it opens the filling port, and when screwed in all 
the way it isolates the compressor.  I assume this is so one can 
replace the compressor without losing system charge.

to tell you that a rebuilt starter from impco or adsit(mail order parts houses
for MB) want $199 plus a $40 or $50 core. The price included all taxes and labor
for taking it off rebuilding and then putting it back on.
 If you are like me I would perfer to keep the original piece if will work just

Subject: Re: Testing a/c for leaks

Bob -

You have committed two fatal errors.  The first one and most significant
is that you put air into the system and air contains moisture.  That is
the worst possible thing you could have done.  Better install a new
filter/dryer before attempting to fill with freon.  Even after evacuating,
which may remove most of the moisture, the filter will be useless. 

The next thing to remember is that the high side of the a/c system will 
probably operate somewhere in the range of 300-325PSI during a hot day.  
No leaks will be found at 40PSI but at 250 or above watch out or that 
compressor will just blow all the freon out of the system over a period 
of a few uses.

The right way to check the system is to fill with nitrogen and leak check
with a pressure around 120-150PSI.  Then evacuate the system and pull a
vacuum of 30MG (inches of mercury) which should be able to be held for
over 30 minutes.  If you can't pull the vacuum, you have a leak, or if the
vacuum won't hold you have a leak.  The new electronic leak detectors can
check for a leak up to 1/2 oz per year (so they claim).

Ron,

If the Motronic system uses a manifold reference fuel pressure regulator, then
the fuel pressure will vary according to manifold pressure.  As the manifold 
pressure drops (lighter load on engine,etc), then the fuel pressure will drop.

This is done to keep the pressure drop accross the injector orifice constant so
that the fuel delivery is only a function of how long the injector is open, 
which of course the computer determines. By the way, the delivery, as in gm/sec
is related to the pressure as a square law.  If you doubled the pressure, the 
delivery would only increase by the square root of the change, or about 40%.

Steve -

Depending on the seat mounting hardware you have, you may be able to 
mount the eye-bolt on a bar that fastens to the front mounting bolts for 
the seat. No drilling and it's strong. In my own installation I used a 
length of "unistrut" material.

Subject: Do all '89 911C4's leak oil?

I have had two 18989 911 C4's up on a lift and both show oil leaking from 
one or more cylinder heads.  The owner of the last car (I was getting it 
checked out today to purchase) was upset that we found oil leaking.  He 
called the local Porsche dealer (Jim Ellis in Atlanta) b/c he had just
had the car checked out 30 days ago and they hadn't reported the oil 
leak.  The Jim Ellis employee he talked to said they all did that and 
that is why it wasn't reported.

BTW, the car only has 21k miles.

Anyway, I read in "The Used 911 Story" about the head to cylinder leaks 
and that it cost $8,000 to have it fixed.

If I find that this is "normal" (I'm going to call the dealer & Franz 
Blam) then I would probably do a leak down on all cylinders.  Is that a 
"good enough" test?

Any thoughts?  Any previous/current C4 owners want to comment?

Also, the current owner said he didn't have to add any oil and the engine 
cover plate showed oil only in the "sponge area".  In other words, it 
wasn't dripping profusely.

Finally, the front differential had a small amount of trans fluid on it.  
Is this normal?

Thanks

Subject: Bought Corvair/914 $500 +912E#1update

Diagnosed Porschephiliacs,
	I checked on that odd corvair engined 914 and it was only a "4" 
not a "6" as he had hoped.  He said the possibility of it being a six was 
the only reason he didn't get rid of it, the car has few parts valuable 
to a mechanic (weird engine, badly rusted body).  He then asked if I was 
interested in buying it.  He said he'd tow it to my garage for $500.  I 
thought about it for about, oh, 5 seconds and agreed to it.  
	Some of the cool things it has:
                       Five bolt vented discs (need to be turned),  wide 
(don't know exactly) minilite style wheels with polished outers and gold 
painted inners,  crazy looking(??)heavy duty rear suspension that flare  
the wheels out about 5 inches, Koni shocks, nice interior w/ real 
leather seats but cracked dashpad, fiberglass front/rear flares (one fell 
off it was so rusted around it! still have all 4 though), and complete 
(from what I can see) Corvair flat six conversion.  I think the clutch is 
bad, that's probably the reason its in a repair yard.  
	What I need:  I'm going to try to find a 914 with a decent body 
but bad engine/ interior to swap all my stuff into.  Is it worth it or 
did I buy a pile of worthless junk?  I love to tinker with cars, and if 
it's not worth swapping into a good body, I'll just get it running in its 
present rusty shape and have one fast 914 that looks like sh*t.  About 
the 912E, its still sitting in the shop waiting for winter season (lax 
time for mechanics here) to come again so he can chop it.  That STILL 
makes me sick, but at least I have a new toy.  Advice would be 
appreciated.  CU  :^)

Subject: 924/944 Turbo Mufflers.


The 924 and 944 mufflers are not real mufflers. They are resonators
which have no baffles. They use length and size to tune the octave 
harmonics to reduce the exhaust noise. They are *very* low restriction.

About the only thing you gain by eliminating the cat back piping is 
weight reduction. By removing the Catalyst, however, you will reduce
restriction and get a slightly better spool-up of the exhaust side of 
the turbo. For the 924, this gives a slight improvement over stock. It 
needs some mixture adjustment for the higher rpm ranges.

If you are working with a 944 Turbo, then you should talk to Jon 
Milledge about a PROM which will take advantage of the lower exhaust 
restriction and the turbo mods/improvemnts you can also use.

The normal 944 uses a reverse-flow muffler. This is applicable to all
non-turbo models. The OEM factory muffler is hard to beat for street 
use. The rest make noise and make your wallet lighter. Even if you are
on the track, you should consider a muffler. I have run gutted catalysts
with a stock muffler and gotten a few more HP. I have used a straight 
pipe in place of the stock catalyst and gotten less power. On any DME-
equipped car, you should consider what the DME is doing and what mods 
to the DME you are allowed before dicking around with the intake or 
exhaust.

Spark Plugs. My absolute best results are with indexed Bosch Silvers in
my 1983 944. The same plugs in friends 944 Turbos and 944S2s indicate 
similar results. There was a reason the Porsche factory specified these
plugs in the owners manual as specified replacement types. In my 1973
911S, the ORIGINAL sytle platinums worked best on the track or in 
extended high speed situations.

They didn't report it because they all do it?  This chapps my ass!
Report it? They are supposed to *FIX* it!
Porsche knows about it and so does Jim Ellis! The owner should raise hell!
This very thing is why I'm afraid to buy an '89 C4 or '90 C2 - they leak
oil sooner or later..., but will the dealer fix it without the owner
having to threaten to do the service manager bodily harm?

OK. Maybe I've had a little too much caffeine today, but this is near

Byron Short has told us about his drain pipe muffler mod and how well it appears
to work. Byron, I am interested to hear from you and others about the 
derivability of your installation. My only experience with an open pipe was on 
an MGA where I had a very vivid first hand experience of what the m'bike racers 
knew all about. Namely that the stack popular at the time and known as a 
megaphone for obvious reasons did in fact produce a very noticeable power 
increase. But over about a five rpm band! Outside of resonance power was 
pathetic. Your installation however uses a turbo and my interest is piqued to 
know if the effect of taking energy out of the exhaust also detunes the system 
enough to make the car drivable, or are you still working hard to stay on the 
'phones as those in the know used to say.

Curiosity killed the cat but I would still like to know.

Yep, plus there's two 911 brochures - one is "The New 911 Carrera", one is "911

If you like, I'll announce to the list when the 911 Turbo brochures are out (though

>BTW, the NSX has a hardcover brochure- kind of hard to get for free, though.

Really? Hmm, our group of dealerships includes an Audi dealership, but it's on the

To be 100% safe you could flush the system with denatured alcohol after
draining the current old cruft.  Then use new fluid.

I'd recommend ATE Blue, is should be about $16 for enough for a complete
system.  Its DOT4, and has a high boiling point.

Use a good DOT3, like Castrol LMA GT (use the GT *NOT* the "regular" LMA)

Take a turkey baster and suck out as much of the old fluid as you can, then
re-fill the reservoir. Then hookup your Eezibleed (you *DO* have an Eezibleed,
don't you?) and bleed away.

DOT5 is just plain evil, DOT4 an unnecessary complication.

The protocol is simple: you upload something, you send me a private note

First, yes, almost all Porsche leak oil. The only ones that don't are 
the ones that haven't started yet. Think of it as proof of fine German
craftsmanship.

Second, the oil is *NOT* leaking from the cylinder heads. It could be 
leaking from the valve covers (likely), or something else higher, and 
dripping from the cylinders looking like it's leaking from the cylinder
heads. But it's not leaking oil from there. The leak that Bruce refers
to is that of COMPRESSION. That's a lot worse, and $8k is a cheap fix
if that's the problem.

They said Porsche is going to offer a 170 bhp 4 cyl and a 210 bhp flat six.
 I believe they said rear engine also.  Something about $40,000.

For $40,000 why not use the 236(?) bhp 968 engines.  170 bhp and $40,000
don't mix (not even 210).

Subject: Re: Lowering a 911

          Chris Bennet wondered how to lower his '86 Carrera, and Eric
          Brown offered some advice.  Thought I'd add my 2 cents
          worth (Given how long this has gotten, it's more like $2!).

          First, why lower?  I'm planning to lower my '79 911SC to
          what I think are stock levels for the Carrera.  For
          non-track cars, Bruce Anderson recommends the following ride
          heights: 25 inches from floor to top of rear fender lip, and
          25.5 inches to top of front fender lip.  My understanding is
          much lower than that and you have to go to thicker (i.e.
          stiffer) torsion bars to keep from bottoming the suspension.
          If you just want to lower 0.5", you might be able to do it
          during the alignment, rather than messing with the torsion
          bars.

          In my case, I need to lower the rear about 1.5" and the
          front about 1" to get to these heights.  The SCs for the USA
          were high from the factory due to US bumper height
          requirements.

          To lower the rear, jack up the car and support on jackstands
          under the torsion bar tube.  The method of measuring the
          spring plate angle that Eric described is accurate, except
          you must do this with the spring plate hanging free.  This
          means unbolting it from the control arm.  You have to
          support it with a floor jack and lower it slowly after
          undoing the lower shock absorber bolt and all of the bolts
          holding the spring plate to the control arm.  If not
          supported, the torsion bar tension will cause the arm to
          violently snap downward.  Also, the angle you want to
          measure is the difference between the inclination of the
          jacked up car and the spring plate.

          Next remove the cover over the end of the torsion bar tube.
          I think the outer end of the torsion bar has 40 splines, and
          the inner has 44.  This means that removing the spring plate
          and moving it one spline results in (360 degrees/40)=9
          degree change in spring plate angle.  According to my little
          Spec Book, a 1 degree change should result in a 7 to 9 mm
          change in ride height, so moving one spline could change
          your ride height by 2 to 3 inches!  You have to increment
          the inner and the outer ends of the torsion bar in different
          directions to get the change you want.  I'm planning to
          use this method, rather than dealing with spring plate
          angle.  This assumes that you can easily remove the spring
          plate and the torsion bar, which I've heard may be a big
          assumption.  Make sure you don't mix up left and right side
          bars, and don't nick the protective coating or the bar may
          rust and break.  This has to be done for each side of the
          car.

          This is a compilation of info from the factory manuals, the
          Haynes manual, Bruce Anderson's book, and the Spec Book.
          There was also an article in Excellence last year on doing
          this.

          I'm less clear on how to do the front, although I think
          it's easier.  I'm planning to just feel my way along here,
          or send an Email to Bruce Anderson for advice.  I'll let you
          all know how I make out.

Keith,
You wrote about a 914-6 w/new paint, orig wheels w/a price of 10k that you
might be able to get to 9k.

If you're looking for value, originality is important.. does it have the
original engine/trans? All original panels, interior, etc? But, most
important, is it rusty? Just because it's had a new paint job does not mean
it doesn't have a rust problem.  Verify this first!  Rust will turn a
reasonable price into a high one very fast when/if you have it fixed!

If it's solid, original and runs ok, 9k would be a good price.  There are
cheaper cars out there, but always it seems, with problems.  There are more
expensive cars out there (good ones and bad ones).  Be careful and consult
with the 914 experts on Pfiles before you spend your money.
Good luck,

I also have a 3" pipe from the cat back that I put on for the track season.
It's a little loud for my tastes for the street, but it sounds so great at
the track, I leave it on.  Actually, I have it flared to a 4" tip and just
got it 'aluminized' (or something like that) with a white powdery coating to
keep it from rusting out.  From the back, it looks similar to the turbo cup
car exhaust.  Not near as mean a sound though...

Removing the muffler really helps to keep the engine temperature down during
hot summers, and allowed me to keep up with a 951S on nearly all of Summit
Point this past Sunday!  The 247hp S still walks away from me on the long
straight, but I seem to have just as much torque at speeds under 100.

Let us know how the pipe works on your S2...

Subject: Annoying squeak in 78SC

James

Two possibilities. Based on the age, it is quite possible that it is the 
torsion bar rubbing in its tube because the mounting which originally held 
it centered inside the tube has worn. As I understand it, the solution is to 
rebuild the mount which requires a weld.

The other alternative, which is why I am on the verge of replacing mine, is 
the shock itself. Mine are Boge and one of the fronts is driving me with its 
constant squeeking. Easy to check. Jack up the corner so the shock is 
extended and spray WD40 inside the shock tube. Mine goes away, but only for 
a day or so.

Ahh GEICO, the company that systematically buys and distributes radar guns

All in the name of safety of course; the increased premiums from the

2) are all oil leaks a sign of bad things to come or are some the sign

I am buying a 91, 911 Turbo that has never been registered or driven. The car
was driven 5 miles when it was purchased and then stored. The owner has
started the car a few times but not often. The last time the motor was run
was 6 months ago. He put a new battery in it and started it up yesterday. We

all cylinders. The gas tank is nearly empty we want to put fresh gas in
before we let the engine run. Any advice on buying a car like this?
Naturally, I am concerned that seals have dried up. I believe that the engine
problem is a fuel related problem and should clear up after we let it run
with new gas. Thanks in advance.

Subject: Grease and Torques Settings

Michael Willis wrote "......Keep the grease out of the threads."

This brings up a question.  I've been told by a QC buddy of mine that grease
and anti-sieze compounds have a definite negative effect on torque settings.
 He states that, particularly on higher torqued fasteners, these compounds
can actually cause stretching of the fastener, since higher than spec torque
is actually achieved by the lubricant use.  He also stated that a fastener's
factory rated torque can also be messed up by the use of plated fasteners, if
they are not original.

This makes logical sense to me, but if true, how does one adjust for the use
of anti-sieze compounds - particularly on wheel nuts.  I have used these for
years on my wheel nuts, and exhaust components, but worry if I should make
some sort of torque adjustment or just stop using them.  

How about the group - what are your feelings?

Please be gentle, this is my first post, and yes it is a "what should I 
buy?" request (gasp!).

Now, I was all ready to purchase a 92 MR2 Turbo, when my 3 friends, lets 
call them 1986 911Carrera, 1973 911SC(?), and 1980 911SC, decided to have 
an "intervention."  Lets see, there exact words, "Why purchase a 
wanna-be, mall driving, sports car.  Get something with class."

Needless to say, I am beginning to be swayed.  My $$$ limit is 
approximately $12,000.  However, the main reason I am getting rid of my 
1983 toyota celica is the constant headaches with its falling apart, 150K 
miles...Now with the price range I am in, I am relegated to getting a 911 
with mucho miles.  Now, I am getting myself into a nightmare?  I really 
don't want to be working on a car every weekend (even if I could!!).

So, basically, with no further ado...what should I do?  I was looking in 
the local autotrader, and I saw a 1980 911SC Targa, AC, Cruise, 
maintained with org. porsche parts, new top, starter, clutch, water seal, 
fuel relays, and ignition, HIGH FREEWAY MILES (the sellers wife said it 
was under 200,000, but over 150,000), solid trans, and strong engine, all 
for $9500.  Now this seems remarkably low.  Of course, one of my 3 
friends (1973 911) has a really good friend who works on nothing but 
Porsches in his shop (supposedly well respected), so I would have him 
check any possible purchase.

Sorry, about rambling, but this is a major decision for me, a guy whose 
previous cars were a 1980 Chevy Citation, and a 1983 Celica.

Thanks,

Subject: Stainless Steel Valves for 914 2.0L......Stan's right again!!!


Hello 'philes,

Well, Stan has been proven right once again....stainless steel
valves suck in a 914 2.0L engine.  A little while ago, a mechanic
friend of mine was about to rebuild a guy's engine.  I mentioned
to him the warnings I heard here about NOT using SS valves
and he half-believed me.  He gave his customer a choice
and being on a budget, he opted for the SS valves and hoped
they'd be OK.  After the engine was rebuilt, and a happy customer
was driving around, I showed printouts of Stan's warnings to
my friend.

He started to worry....then he called up the customer and told
him what he just found out.  My friend said if the guy wanted to
pay for the new factory valves, he'd install them for free.

Well, 2 days ago the engine was torn apart.  It had 4000 miles
on it since the rebuild.  The SS valves were pitted, and the seats
and guides were worn.  The valves were burning up.  My friend
figures they would have lasted another 4000 miles before
chunks fell into the combustion chamber and done lots of
damage.

He will NEVER use those again.....

Thanks, Stan!!!

I'll second Bob's advice.  

Years ago, I had a part time job selling parts in a primarily VW shop.  

It used to drive me "up the wall" when a mail order customer would come in 
and say something like:

   Customer:  I ordered this VW part mail order, it took two weeks to get 
              here, and it's missing a chrome piece.

              Do you stock the missing piece?

   Me:        Only as part of the same blister packed assembly. 

              If I pull the part out of the assembly, the remainder won't be
              saleable.

              You could buy our assembly and return the other.

              Otherwise you'll have to deal with the mail order source.

   Customer:  That $*%# mail order company.

              (gripe, gripe, gripe)

              (customer leaves the store)


From the retailer's perspective,

       1. They don't make a profitable sale.
       2. They are expected to sympathetically listen to complaints about
          a mail order competitor.
       3. There MAY be a residual possibility of future business.

It's hard for a local retailer to compete price-wise with a mail order firm
that may carry almost no inventory, doesn't maintain a retail store, and 
doesn't have retail store overhead.

I'm NOT saying "don't deal mail order", but if you want to keep a local
retailer in business, try to keep whatever business you do with them profitable
to them.

Don't just waste their time.

I purchased a 16-row Earl's oil cooler (4 7/8" H) but am not sure where the
most efficient placement would be.  If I place it up front I would probably
have to install a heavy-duty oil pump.

Has anyone had success with rear placement and, if so, where was it placed?

Try your brake hoses. I had this prob once on an old 356 C Cpe - seems the
hoses swell on the INSIDE from age and water and fluid and heat cycles ete
etc. The Mcyl can push fluid through but there is not enough "oomph" to let
the fluid come back to the Mcyl/Reservoir & so it keeps pressure on the
caliper pistons to keep pads engaged. After replacing all 4 rubber hoses &
bleeding the system, never encountered it again. Dunno, but it may be worth a
look. Good Luck.

OK guys, before I forget.  Was rooting through my old philes to see which ones to 
let go, and noticed again this story about aircooling and lack of valves. HAHA 
good joke; I have a couple of CBX's (Yes Honda, Yes Japanese 2 wheeler) with not 
only lots of cylinders (6 each) but even more lots of valves (24 each) and what's 
more *AIRCOOLED* The japanese had this aluminum casting down to a fine art in the 
70's, the cylinder heads on these babies is truly a work of art.
	AND LETS NOT FORGET the Honda NR750, which is a V-Four design and has a 
massive *EIGHT* valves per cylinder, has oval cylinders but is, however, 
watercooled. 
	However, changing the heads on a Porsche engine to accept more valves may 
be a different story..

Dave,

'The Used 911 Story' is a small reference book that points out things to 
look for when buying a used 911.  It covers each year and the specifics 
of that year.  I found it helpful because it is one of the few books that 
covers the 1989-93 C2 and C4 models.

Author: Peter Zimmerman
Publisher: PMZ Publications
Lib of Congress Catalog Card #: 81-7003

It's not the type of book you'll find at your local mall.  I purchased 
mine through Moffett's.  They advertise in back of Excellence.

Moffett's; 12 Francis St.; Cocoa Beach, FLA. 32931
     Orderline: 1-800-356-2911
     Infoline :   407-783-1820 (voice & fax)

I paid $18.95 for book plus $3.99 S+H.

Hope that helps,

Pick up a copy of either Cycle World or MotorCyclist.  There are plenty of
good mail order places which advertise in those mags.  

If you're not sure which helmet you want, go to a local bike shop and try on
a few.  Some places will even match the prices of the mail-order joints.
 Personally, I like Shoei and have an RF-200.  I believe these are still
being produced.  Arai (another difficult-to-pronounce helmet company) also
makes some excellent lids.  In my experience, you either have a Shoei head or
an Arai head, so it does pay to try a few on before making a decision.  Brand
is entirely relevant.

Either way, you will be extremely well protected and quite comfortable.

I think this is the important thing.  I've actually been paying higher-

Subject: 911 Tire "chunking"

Hey,

I have a set of "cheap" BFG Euro TA tires on the rear
of my 911.  I have had a problem with chunking of the 
tread at driver's ed events.  By chunking I mean basically
large chunks of tread are coming off at the sidewall-
tread interface.  This has happened twice - yesterday
being the most recent.  Could this be a factor of the
tread design?  My pressures were at 35PSI, alignment
is OK, etc.  The tires do have alot of tread on them (I can't
wear 'em out).

I now have to buy new tires as these are not usable for
any more track events.  I'm leaning towards Yoko AVSs
or Bridgestone RE71s, etc.  Should I expect the same thing
to happen to these?  

What I really need to do is buy a cheap set of wheels and
get some track tires for them but I wouldn't mind the wear
on my new tires - I just don't want to ruin them with one
track event.

remember Dr. 914 mentioning that the 75-76 were different and
undesirable for some reason.)
        I could simply be overlooking the numbers, of course.
But I've checked on the bit in front of the oil filler, I've
looked behind it as well, and even on the flat spot toward the

Wow, now that would be fun.  But, I'll tell ya.  The absolutely cheapest

Rule of thumb is:
1) Replace Belts.

2) Re-adjust belts at 1500 miles.

3) Re-adjust belts at 15000 miles.

4) Replace belts at 30000 miles.

For me, since I own a belt gauge and track the car extensively, I check 
the belts each couple of months and replace at 10K miles.

I wouldn't be worried about belt problems with 20K miles, but would schedule 
replacement and replacement of any suspect pulleys or idlers...

Good luck, GB

Removing the switch is easy.

1) Pry off the black plastic ring on the outside of the switch.
2) Undo the retaining nut.
3) Push the switch into the panel behind the quarterpanel.
4) Remove the air grille in the door post.
5) reach in and retrieve the switch.

Please note that the switch is not repairable.

Replacement switches with keys are available from the dealer.

No!  They actually STRETCH?

Why, that would mean that tension would be developed across the bolts, 
and they might -- I know this sounds crazy -- actually hold things 
together.

Duh.

Someone should tell your buddy that all bolts MUST stretch in order to 
do their job.  In fact, bolt-tightening operations are often specified 
by the amount of bolt elongation at the desired tension.

Since bolt-stretch is hard to measure, however, most tightening specs 
show torque settings instead.  These settings invariably assume the use 
of thread lubrication.

Without any lube, the settings are grossly affected by the friction 
between mating threads.  Without thread lube, your torque wrench may 
read 100 pounds, for example, but a good portion of that torque will be 
devoted to overcoming friction.  When you remove the wrench and 
everything relaxes a little, the torsional stress goes away and the 
tension load which remains will be much less than what you want.

Buy the MR2 Turbo.  It's faster than any of the 911s your friends own, 
it handles better, and it's orders of magnitude more reliable.  It 
doesn't look as goofy as a 911, either.

For your $12,000, you can get an MR2 Turbo with low miles, leather 
interior (if you like that sort of thing), A/C, power everything, ABS, 
etc.  If you look carefully, you'll find one with a transferable 5-year 
warranty.

I have a feeling that you'll be much less happy with a late-70s or 
early-80s 911.

Well, that's too much oil cooler for starters. You should have been just

I always mount up front except on tube-frame race cars. There's just no
good place to hang a cooler in the back that allows it to get any air

I were doing the pro race thing these days, it would *DEFINITELY* be
under an Arai hat. I"m not, so it's a Simpson.

This is actually pretty common on many tires. It's why the practice
of "shaving" started -- theory is that the tread blocks are too tall,
that they "squirm" under load and that the resultant heat build-up causes
them to separate from the carcass. Shaving reduces the height of the
tread blocks, cutting down on heat, etc. OF course, now days the tires
start to really get sticky at the shave depth, as the manufacturers 
started seeing a way to increase performance *AND* revenue... but I 
digress...

I ran Yoko AVS Intermediates for 6 years on my 911. Street. Track.
Autox. *GREAT* tires. Used to run RE71Rs on the showroom stock

See "Screw to Win" by Carroll Smith (Actual title is "Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners,
and Plumbing Handbook"). If you're racing, you should have two copies of 
this -- on in the bathroom, one in the toolbox. Great stuff.

Slight lubrication -- the spec is *USUALLY* "one or two drops of a light
machine oil" -- is needed to make sure you don't have threat stiction
giving an unrealisticly high reading on the fastener.

Gobs of grease and never-sieze *CAN* also have the same effect. They
add extra goop between the male and female threads, and this can cause
the same sort of binding.

Well, the engine is made of these large pieces of aluminium, and where
they come together, if there's oil pooling behind it, you can pretty much
count on it eventually leaking. Candidates are the case center seam, the
cylinder-case interface, the head-cam carrier interface, the cam towers,
the valve covers. You can also get leaks from the oil sender, the oil
cooler, the thermostat, the various lines that make up the oil system, and
the oil return tubes....

Oil is like any fluid: it seeks the lowest level. So when you have oil
dripping off of the bottom of something, that's *NOT* likely to be where
the oil is coming from unless you're really really lucky. Take the car to
a pressure do it yourself car wash, hose off the bottom of the engine, and
then run it for a while. See if you can figure out the source of the leak
once it's clean. Nothing else works (except radioactive tracers and flurescent
dyes and crap).

No. But it's also a possiblity.

Anderson, Bruce. See "Minor Deity" in the Porsche Dictionary. See also

have this book. Period.

> 1) is running a compression leak-down test on a cold engine a "good"

Nope. You have an oil leak. Oil leaks, unless they're pressure leaks (in
which case, believe me, you'd know it) are *NEVER* fatal on any of the 
air cooled cars. Unless of course all your oil leaks out and you don't know
it, and then in my opinion it still wasn't the oil leak, it was pilot
error...

You need a compression test and a leak down test to see if the engine is
any good. Plus having it checked out thoroughly by a competent mechanic.
I would seriously hesitate to use the current mechanic, as they may know
the car well enough to lie successfully, and will likely figure that if
something *IS* broken they might be able to get you to let them fix it down
the line. Then again, I'm cynical and paranoid...

Depends. I've had over a dozen Porsches. All but one leaked, and it didn't
have an engine.

Then again, I've never had a catastrophic problem except in a race car.

This is OK if and only if you are going to disassemble the parts and get
all the alcohol out of there too.  It's a good thing to do if you are 
switching
between glycol and silicone.  However, if you're just cleaning out nasty
old glycol, I would rather just flush new glycol through.

I don't think that alcohol has any magic cleansing properties.  If things 
are
really bad enough on the '66, it would be prudent to rebuild the callipers

They don't all leak, but a bunch do and PCNA is aware of the problem.
The solution calls for replacing all the cylinders and refacing the

dated 28 April 1992.  They are warranteeing the work, but to my

Subject: RE: Grease and Torques Settings


Pat,

This is true -- with lubrication, you need less shear stress (torque) to
establish what you really want, which is tension stress.

However, to my experience torque values are invariably called out
taking into consideration the kind of lubricant being used.  For example,
conn rod bolt torque is spec'ed given that the bolts are coated with
engine oil.  Ditto for lug nuts: your car comes from Porsche with anti-
seize on the lug bolts, and the 96 ftlb spec is correct.

Replating fasteners will affect torque because of the different
interference fit.  Simplest thing is to not use re-plated fasteners on
a car you plan ti actually drive.

Hi, Tracy,

Let me clear up one thing about the MY87+ cars with the built-in tensioner:

The tensioner does not provide a continuous adjustment.  It is used at the
time of the initial installation of the belt and at further maintenance
activities. Once the timing belt tension is set, the adjustment is locked
down and remains that way until the tensioner is loosened.

In light of that consideration, and in light of the fact that the balance
shaft belt does not have the benefit of an automatic adjuster, I would
follow the above recommendation...

Good luck

Sorry Bob, but I just have to throw my two cents in about this.

Remember the line about buying a $10.00 helmet if you've got a $10.00
head?  The same line of thinking goes for used helmets.

Two problems with used helmets:

  1)	The lining (styrofoam) dries out in a couple of years, making
	the helmet useless.  Three years is about the life span of
	a helmet.

  2)	Helmets are "use once and discard" items.  The very first time
	you say to yourself "Darn, I'm glad I had a helmet on", THROW
	IT AWAY AND GET A NEW ONE!  It now has a gazillion tiny little
	cracks in it, and probably won't work next time.

Helmets are cheap; heads are not.

Gary.

Subject: 951 brake problem

Knowledgeable enthusiasts,

I am having trouble with the brakes on my 1986 951.  I would describe the
problem as "major brake fade".  Under all types of braking, the car initially
brakes hard, and then seems to continue decelerating at a constant/linear
rate rather than an increasing rate of deceleration.  Actually, it seems as
if the car decelerates less and less.  Eighteen wheelers can brake more
quickly than my car right now!

I have new rotors all around, a new (less than six months) master cylinder,
new brake lines, and meaty Cool Carbon brake pads (I don't mind the
squeaking, so I leave them on for the street...).  

My mechanic has sweated over this and thinks it may be the proportioning
valve.  Could this be it?  Any advice is appreciated!  I have a track event
in less than two weeks and would look forward to it more if my brakes were
100%.

Personal mail to: Drive951@aol.com would be fine, if preferred.

Thanks,

Anyway, I believe the MR2 was significantly improved in '93, FWIW.
You're recommending a non-Porsche (a Toyota, no less) on a Porsche

I thought the MR2 Turbo was somewhere in the high $30K range new. I find

Tim:
I agree with one thing Andy said above - if you buy the MR2 Turbo, definitely
find one with the 5 yr warranty.  Your friend with the '80 SC probably
doesn't have a warranty, but with proper maintenance, he'll still be driving
his car 5 years from now and if he looks after it, I think it will be worth
more that a clapped out MR2 Turbo and not a lot less than you could pay for
one now. This is a biased opinion on my part, but it's also a realistic one.

Hey Mark,

I tried to reply to you the other nite but got interrupted.  Probably all 
of the 911 seats that bolt flat on the floor will probably interchange.  

I do know that the mid '70s-'80s Accessory recaros used slide mounts that 
replaced the slides that came on the seats as delivered.  My '70 and my 
'74 use the same seat mounting arrangements. That should be a clue to you.
 
I have mounted a set of LX seats in the '70.  The seats came out of a 
Rabbit.  A couple of chunks of angle iron and a little welding got the 
seats in there just right.

	2.  Yes, the MR2 was improved in 1993.  '93 MR2 Turbos are 	
	outside Tim's budget.

	3.  If there were a Porsche in his price range that competed 	
	with the MR2 Turbo, I'd recommend it.  Since there isn't, I 	
	recommended the Toyota.  By the way, Bill Gates (who apparently 
	so fascinates you people that you've filled the list with 	
	stories about him) drives a Toyota (well, a Lexus... same thing) 
	every day.

	4.  Yes, 911s look goofy.  The headlights and fenders have 	
	just recently changed after 30 years, the wing windows still 	
	haven't, and that "widow's peak" where the roofline meets the 	
	windshield is just plain bizarre.  The rear end comes to a 	
	point, making the car look a little like a cockroach, and the 	
	new active rear spoilers look ridiculous.

	5.  Yes, new MR2 Turbos do cost about $30K.  Like any car, 	
	though, good examples can be had cheaply if you're willing to 	
	spend some time looking.  Actually, $14K is a more reasonable 	
	estimate for a '92; Tim may have to buy a '91 if he can't swing 
	the extra cash.

	6.  I have no idea what a used 951 costs.  If they can be 	
	purchased for $12K, Tim may want to look into buying one.  	
	However, his original post mentioned that his friends were 	
	recommending against buying a "wanna-be, mall-driving sports 	
	car".

	7.  I should know better than to try reasoning with someone 	
	whose signature looks like a compilation of "Robb Report"

Jason:

Granted, the 911 is a great car.  If it weren't, I wouldn't have gone to 
all the trouble to transplant $20K of 911 parts onto my 914.

It may even be the best sports car ever; its 30-year life certainly 
makes it the oldest, and that says a lot about the genius of its 
designers.

"Distinguished," though?  I don't think so.  While the car has a 
distinguished history, the design just looks old-fashioned.  If Porsche 
had never built a 911, and Hyundai unveiled a car with the same body 
style today, people would laugh.  It's only the mystique of the Porsche 
flagship, and the association with the long history of 911 racing 
victories, that makes the design even acceptable today.

Don't get me wrong... I wouldn't want Porsche to change the essential 
911 styling cues.  Making the car's styling fit the currently-accepted 
norm would be sorta stupid.  All I'm saying is that the car's styling 
was weird in 1965 (even the famous Fuchs five-spoke alloys were 
ridiculed when they were first introduced -- Bruce Anderson quotes a 
friend of his as likening them to the wheels of a circus bandwagon), and 
it's still just as weird today (and showing its age, besides).

Ref hiring a 911 in europe

Hertz definitely do not hire porsches

Other major companies may but it is unlikely

A few years ago a friends wife hired my friend a 911 turbo for the day to 
celebrate his 30th birthday - this was around 1986 and it cost 200 pounds 
for the day.

I think they hired from a small specialist shop - the kind of place that 
hire rollers for weddings etc

The going rate for car hire is around 30 pounds/day in the 
UK/France/germany for the very small cars 50 for a reasonable size 4 seater

Spain is a bit cheaper, Greece and is the most expensive

BTW in the UK we get around 5k car related deaths a year among 15 million 
drivers, in Greece and Portugal they get around 25k deaths a year among 
less than 5 million drivers, so as you can guess the chances of taking a 
dent is very high in these countries - every time I have hired in spain, 
the car has always been scraped. Most of these countries do not offer CDW 
options, a dent is highly likely.

Subject: 911 development plans -> 996


The German magazine "Auto Zeitung" has an article in the 11th March
1995 issue about Porsche's development plans for the 911. I have
no idea how accurate this info really is.

The main points they make:

+  The 1996 911 will have 285 HP (instead of 272) thanks to detail
   improvements

+  At the end of 1995 a new turbo-look C4 will appear.

+  At the 1995 IAA Porsche will present a new Targa, "based on the cabriolet
   with an electric glass roof," literally translated from the German.

+  The once-planned entry-level 911 with 240 HP won't be produced

+  The new (996) model of the 911 will be available in August 1997, first
   as C2 coupe, later as C4 and cabriolet.  Main points:

	* The new 911 and the Boxster (boxster is for summer 1996 release)
	  will have an identical chassis (at least the front half of the
	  car) although of course Porsche wants the cars to look
	  very different.

	* The car will be completely freshly designed "from the ground up,"
	  although the suspension of the 996/986 will be based on the 
	  current 993 suspension. Porsche plans to introduce adaptive
	  (active?) damping, and the brakes and tyres should be improved
	  from the 993.

	* The boxer will finally be water cooled, 4 valves per cylinder.
	  This is a completely new engine, smaller and more efficient.
	  Also quieter (alas). Planned is 3.3l, 275 PS. 

	* The car should be somewhat faster that the 993: lighter and
	  less wind resistance.

	* New tiptronic will be offered, with six gears.  Maybe this
	  is a manual box with an automatic clutch?  Tiptronic will
	  also be offered on the C4 and turbo for the first time.

	* The car is flatter, wider and longer that the 993.  More
	  interior and luggage space.  Safety features to include
	  side airbags.

	* The car will be cheaper to produce.  Apparently the Porsche 
	  marketing heinies are debating whether they want to make the
	  base car cheaper or if they want to offer more standard
	  features for the same price.

Subject: Factory tour report

It's 4 am and I'm wide awake having returned from Frankfurt yesterday. 
Our trip began in cold, rainy Stuttgart where the US$ is a poor cousin to 
the DM. The exchange rate was down to 1.39 at the numerous (greedy) money 
changers.
Even with a fair knowledge of German, buying an S-Bahn ticket at the 
Stuttgart HBf (train station) is confusing. Find a friendly local to help 
you use the machines and show you how to validate your ticket in the 
punching machine.
The guide spoke excellent English, but was not the best informed on 
Porsche's corporate strategy. Nevertheless, one can glean lots of info by 
observing what's to be seen on the factory floor (recognizing this is the 
production factory, not the Weissach R&D center.) He said 40% of the new 
cars were cabs, though my observation didn't seem to bear this out. 6,000 
Boxter orders have been taken and they are converting the 928 "assembly 
line" into a universal line which will build the Boxters or anything else 
for that matter. The guide said "they" were still making changes to the 
Boxter now, but he was clearly not well informed.
I did spot 2 or 3 flat six twin turbo motors off to one side that seemed 
to be fairly complete. Carefully observing the engine assembly, I noted 
the new twin plug motors have no external tensioner piping, and a welcome 
redesign of the bolting ini of the rocker arm shafts. These are probably 
old hat to those of you who have newer mechanicals than me.
As far as a motorcycle, all I saw were many posters of Harleys and 
several items regarding cooperation between H-D and Porsche on 
engineering issues.
The factory tour is highly recommended with a visit to the small but 
interesting on-site Museum. If you are flying into Frankfurt, you can 
catch a train directly to Stuttgart from the airport, or take the S-Bahn 
(commuter train) from the airport to Frankfurt. From there it's about an 
hour and a half to Stuttgart on an Inter-City-Express that cruises at 250 
kph.
The wife and I EuRailed around Europe (this was my second EuRail pass). 
It's a great way to go and if you take a French TGV you will go faster on 
the ground than any production Porsche (sustained 300 kph). (You can't 
blame the Germans. It's much flatter in France and easier to go faster)
If you have any questions on EuRail passes, write me an E-mail.

Hi, Charlie,

Most likely problem is not the proportioning valve, but if you wish, you can
try installing a new one (see the archives for the more appropriate valve
from the 928) or you can just put in a straight line for no reduction in the
pressure to the rear wheels at all.

I would replace the front pads to see if you have not cured them properly.
After all, you're going to need ones sooner or later, why not buy them now 
and see if that is causing your problem...

That is the most likely cause of your problem. (I know, I almost hit a
semi-trailer when it pulled into my lane on the freeway and I couldn't slow
down...) Badly cured trick pads are worse than well cured stock pads...

Good luck,

George,

Hey got the lug nuts and the centercaps, thanks!  I will get a check out
today for what I owe you....

As for the alarm switch problem,

The factory alarm switch, is kinda, sorta, repairable.  We had one seized,
on a friends 944.  The key wouldn't turn on his at all.  We didn't know
any better, so we we took the switch out of the car and took the wires
off the switch (good move, trips the alarm) but if you have someone hold
the wires together the alarm shuts off.  Anyway, we took a knife and cut
open the back of the plastic housing, and it was rather easy to get the
lock out.  So we greased up the lock real good, put it back together and
it has worked fine ever since.  (I should point out that there is a small
circuit board inside the thing, so be careful not to damage it.  I also
visually inspected it to make sure nothing was "burned" out on it).  When
we put it together, we superglued the back on, then wrapped it up in some 
electrical tape.  The operation took about 20 minutes.  Hope this helps....

On Porschephiles you may truly be regarded as a heretic since many Porsche
owners consider ownership a rather religous experience.  Despite your good
intentions while recommending the MR2 Turbo, you have to expect a strong
response when publicly posting such a recommendation on our list.  This is
particularly true when you disparage the very automobile for which this
list serves.

My recommendation would have been not to purchase a Porsche too.  Anywone
who has to scrimp to buy a Porsche will only regret it in the future.
Porsches *are* expensive to own and maintain and I believe that trying to
buy one on a budget is potentially troublesome.

But (and this begins my "religous dogma"), the 911 is a wonderful car to
own and drive.  It's lines even after 30 years are sexy and seductive, at
least to me and to many others.  It handles well when well driven and it
rewards perfection. It sounds wonderful. When properly maintained, it (at
least mine) is extremely reliable.  I can think of no other car that I'd
rather own. No other marque provides me with this level of satisfaction and
pleasure though there are many that I would own for other reasons.

Yeah, I guess it is a religous experience.

One last thing, your comment:

>By the way, Bill Gates (who apparently so fascinates you people. . .

By refering to the list members as "you people" you have aparently excluded

At that rate, I figure that it would be cheaper for me to ship a spare car
over there. If I use it for 2 weeks, and ship it back, I should just about
break even. Besides I think it would be kind of neat to take a 356 back
there. These days, in the summer, a 911 won't be any faster on the autobahn
than a 356 anyway.

     Philes,
     
     I have an interesting problem with my 79 930 that I would like to get 
     the group's opinion on.
     
     The problem is that under moderate braking, the front wheels will lock 
     up.  The point at which it locks is well before any significant 
     deceleration.
     
     Can anyone help me diagnose the problem?  Could it be as simple as the

     master cylinder?  Any advice?

I own a 1986 944.  The previous owner's kid carved some stars out of the seat

Subject: 944 Wheel Bearings

Well, with the early spring we're having, this was the weekend to get baby (an 
'84 944) out of hibernation.  This mainly consisted of doing all the preventive
maintenance that I said I would do over the winter, but didn't.

Among the items on my list, was repacking the front wheel bearings.  I was more
than a little nervous about this, as it was my first time.  It went pretty well, 
but I've got a couple questions for the net.

The biggest problem I had was in getting the seals out.  The Haynes book says to
carefully pry them out with a screwdriver.  Carefully didn't do squat, so I 
did it somewhat less carefully, and did finally get them out.  Is there a tool 
available for this, and if so, where can I get it?

Since I was less than careful, I wound up with some gouges on the inside of the
hub, both where the seal sits and on the chamfered area between the seal and the
actual bearing race (the bearing race itself is fine).  I smoothed them out 
as best as I could with 220 grit sandpaper, so there is no protruding metal, but
there are still some depressions left in the metal (none of which extend past the 
seal).  Is this a problem, as long as it's not on the actual bearing race?  My gut 
feeling is no, but I'd like to get some other opinions.

Finally, I followed the Haynes instructions on tightening the nut until the thrust
washer can just be moved with a screwdriver (what I actually did was to tighten it
until the nut couldn't be moved, then backed off until it could just be moved).  I
am still nervous about the setting though, as I have never seen it done and know this 
is kinda tricky.  Could anyone offer any suggestions to help me determine if I did it 
right (other than drive it and see if the wheels come off).

The wheels do turn smoothly, except for some slight caliper drag.  I took it out for
a short drive, and all seemed well, and I felt the wheels when I got home, and they
didn't seem excessively warm.  I'm probably just worrying too much, but this is the
first time I've done this, and I'm not overly impressed with my own mechanical
ability, so any advice, suggestions, good or bad news would be appreciated.

I found the Haynes technique gave way too loose a setting. The method I 
used was to bolt on the spare tire when checking for play. It allowed for 
more leverage when pushing/pulling the top and bottom of the wheel when 
checking for free play. Also, the hole in the middle allowed for access 
to adjust the nut with the spare bolted on. One thing I found was that 
you had to be careful not to confuse the bearing play with the play where 
that shock absorber shaft enters the strut.
 
After a high speed test drive, I checked it by feeling the hub through 
the 'phone dial' holes. This time, be careful not to confuse the 
warmth/heat produced by braking with any heat from the bearings.
 
Anyone, correct me if I'm wrong.

Subject: Re: Porsche Insurance

After all the venting about the terrible insurance companies, I 
think a bit of balance is due.  I personally know of at least six 
people who have taken their expensive toys to a time trial 
(laughingly described as "drivers education") and turned them into 
ugly little balls of twisted Porsche parts.  They then turned around 
and collected from their insurance agencies for repairs or 
replacement.   Personally, I would like to think I would be too 
ashamed to do something like that, but then I never created one of 
those little balls.

Another factor to consider is that when a Porsche gets pranged, the 
owner often has the audacity to insist that it get fixed up good as 
new.  Well, in the normal repair biz, this is an anomoly.  Most 
folks will accept "good enough for government work" standards.  The 
insurance companies have this factored into their rates and get 
upset at the deviants.  Would you want to insure one of you picky 
perfectionists at the same rate per $1000 value as a Yugo?

It all adds up.  A way to keep you rates low is to accept the risk 
of collision yourself.  That is, only pay for the liability and 
uninsured driver insurance.  This only works if you are not making 
payments.  It can also keep you very attentive to the business at 
hand on the race track.

If the engine has not had the Divialr head studs installed then you will 
need to do this. The old studs pull out of the case. 

Again you need to have the porsche cked out by a por mech. before you 
buy the car. My guess is that since the orig tensioners are still in the 
car the head studs have not been changed. 

As always if the price is right, you can then fix these things yourself. 
Watch out it is EXPENSIVE to rebuild any prosche engines.  911 will run 
apprx 10,000 to 15,000 for a blueprint.  Engine will be worth more than 
the car.

Then most folks are stupid, but you already knew that.
When somebody prangs my car (happens FAR too often - I live
in Massachusetts, after all) they are responsible for making
the car as good as it was before they hit it. I don't give
a flying **** at a rolling Yoko whether they pay for it or
their insurance pays for it, they have to make good, 100%,
on the damage they did. And if they aren't willing, my atty.
is on retainer. If I damage my own car, I fix it myself or I
pay to get it fixed right. "Good enough", as far as I'm concerned,
means perfect. And it doesn't make any difference if it's my
Porsche (HA! That would be the day, wouldn't it?) or my Toyota.

> The insurance companies have this factored into their rates and get

I think you have this backwards. It's the insurance companies that are
deviant, not me... I pay good money for coverage, and I insist on 100%

Of course you get to insist on value for your money.  But, it's the

        I'm not sure on the 944 wheel bearings, but it sounds like
they're adjusted like 914 bearings.
        So the idea is to tighten up the nut until the washer can
*just barely* be moved.  If you can simply push the washer around,
it's too loose.  If you can just barely slide it by (Dave puts Nomex
on) prying with a screwdriver, then it's right.  Now, by "prying"
I mean putting a wide-ish screwdriver blade in and twisting so that
one side of the blade is against a raised part of the hub/whatever
and the other side is against the washer.
        You can check by grabbing the top and bottom of the wheel
or the brake disk and wiggling back and forth.  You should feel a
very slight movement and "clunk".  Very slight is good.  No play may
mean that they're too tight, which can be very bad.  Better a little
loose than a little too tight.  Then you should drive on it for a
while (How long?  Dunno.) and then check the play again.

I looked into renting a porsche in europe 10 years ago.  (yes, it's
been a long time, but I checked into it).  My 944 here in the states
was 1 year old, and I longed to try a P-car out on the Autobahn.

Also, management at work knew of my longing, and agreed to pay for the
rental on my next trip over (since I didn't have enough lead time to
set it up the first time).  Unfortunately, that was my one and only
trip over with that management team.  

Anyway, I found 2 companies in Panorama which would rent Porsches.  
One was in Frankfurt, and the other was, Ithink, in Munich.

The going rate was ~1200 dollars per week (in 1985).  I don't know
what the price is now.  I think that was for a 911.  That price
was just a little too steep for my bank account (although the
Opel Vectra I rented was nearly 400 dollars for the week).

Sorry I don't have the company name, but they did advertise in Pano

        You might go to progressive-rate springs.  They go from 100 #
at low excursion to 160 # at high excursion.  Also, try wide low-profile
tires--I love my 195/50-15s.  If you wanna really hang onto the road,
get R compound tires, like A008RS2's or Comp T/A R1s.  (BFGs are the
current "hot ticket".)  Lower and corner-balance the car.  Don't lower
it all the way to the ground, though!
        If you get bigger springs in back, larger front torsion bars may
be a good way to go.
        Try a larger front sway-bar.  Word out at the autoX course is
that the rear bar is not recommended except for a totally-stock setup.
        Headers and/or an SS exhaust can get you a little bit of power.
        Finally, the cheapest, best-value, and all-aroud best go-fast
goodie that you can possibly get is:  Driver education.  Go to an autoX

Subject: Anti-sieze Compunds.


Unless directed by the Porsche shop manual to do so, do not use anti-
sieze compounds on Porsche engine, transmission or other components.
There was a service bulletin on spark plugs and anti-sieze in water 
cooled aluminum heads backing out if anti-sieze was used. 

One place you are DIRECTED to do so is on 944 and 928 head bolts and 
nuts, you are directed to only use light oil in this instance. 

The Porsche Technical Specification for your model Porsche has many of
these tips in its pages. These books are about $11 and should be 
considered as a required object for any and all Porsche owners.

For 928 owners, these books are surprisingly detailed, still not a
substitute for the shop manuals, but many critical pieces of information
about your car are in those pages.

For all technical spec, order from a dealer and ask for the one for your
specific year and model Porsche.

I did get mine from Automotion, they carry the entire line of Tech Specs.

I have a problem with this perspective. I expect that most of us on this
list need to do at least some budgeting, in terms of choosing what is
most important to do with limited money (although that level of money
will also vary). If you are not in any way limited by money, please do 
not respond. It will only depress the rest of us. 

The real issue in my mind is that if you have to ask this group if you
should buy a Porsche or something else, then you don't want a Porsche
badly enough to make the necessary compromises, unless you have something
approaching unlimited money. I see this as a small variation on the old
saying: "if you have to ask (the price), you can't afford it".

The other point to be made, which is partially contained in the above
post, is that even if you want a Porsche so bad you can taste it, buy one
which you have a fighting chance of maintaining, with some combination
of money and time. Don't assume nothing will go wrong.

In case it is not clear, I would also have recommended that this particular
person not buy a Porsche. My comment relates to the more general 
pronouncement made. Of course, those who have no doubt that they really
want a Porsche will ignore it and buy one anyway.

IMHO,the washer method is highly inaccurate. First, the smoothness of the
rear surface of the locknut which contacts the washer probably varies
greatly from car to car. Mine was a bit rough. This in turn leads to
varying amounts of force required to shift the washer. Another factor is 
the amount of grease between the washer and locknut which I suspect also 
greatly influences the effort required to move the washer.

First, have the entire vehicle inspected by an *independent, *porsche* expert

This makes an excellent negotiating instrument, and will insure against

Personally, I'd walk away from any vehicle like you describe, but:

1.  Case should have shuffle pins installed,
2.  Non-dilivar studs should be replaced with dilivar
3.  '84-on Carrera tensioners should re retrofitted.
4.  Replace thermal reactors, or update entire emission control 
(induction/exhaust) system to later vintage, or it'll *never* pass emissions

5.  Price all this work; *then* *walk* away (advice is always worth just what it

If this is so inaccurate, what do you recommend?  I have been using this
method for years without a porblem on many different cars that use this
same adjustment.  I don't know of any tool that is available that could
measure what you are looking for.  BTW, most, if not all, shops use this
same method; we all can't be wrong?  It's like anyhting else, after you
have done it a few times you will find it to be accurate and you will be
comfortable with it.

I took the fan off my 914 yesterday for a number of reasons.  I now
need a couple of sanity checks:
        1)  Is there a felt washer between the fan and the fan hub
or "spacer" as it is called in The Book?  My manual does not show
one, but I got something like that out of the fan...  It may just
have been accumulated crap.
        2)  I see three galley plugs that I want to goop over so
that they might stay in.  One near where the fan hub is, and two
toward the passengers side of the engine, lower down.  Is that all
there are on the front (fan side) of the engine?  What kind of epoxy
should I use to goop over them?  I was thinking JB Weld.
        Thanks!

A few weeks ago I said I learned to drive while I was a student in England

Then I made a comment that I never had a problem with Boston drivers

I confirm Peter Diffey's comments that hiring a 911 in Germany is a bit

that you may get your car dented or worse in certain places in Europe.

In Paris people parallel park by pushing other parked cars front and back

Hello George B. and Porschephiles:

I drive a 1988 944 Turbo S.  I'm trying to get an idea what the street 
value of my German "investment" is currently.  I've looked at news papers, 
certain classified car magazines and the NADA blue book.  All of them 
mention the '88 944 Turbo but not the Turbo S.  These publications do, 
however, mention the '89 944 Turbo ('88 Turbo S equivalent) at a 
significant increase in cost; more than is justified by the year 
difference in age.

What I'm asking is "what have you seen an '88 944 Turbo S or 89 944 Turbo 
sell for?"  Your observations will be rolled into other information I've 
gathered that will help me realistically valuate my car.

Many thanks in advance,

Subject: Re: 944 Aftermarket Mufflers

 
 I mentioned my 3" straight pipe on my 951 and have generated 4 responses
 about the worthiness of straight pipes.  Two were for, and two were
 against.  Jim Pasha, who is much respected and seems to have a great deal
 of real world knowledge on the subject, feels the pipe is not likely to
 increase power, and that the stock muffler produces *very* little
 restriction.  Neil Walker insists that these kind of changes produce more
 power in a very narrow band, and less power everywhere else due to
 "resonance power", or the "megaphone effect" or something like that. 
 OTOH, Le Triet, who asked the original question which started this thread,
 seems for, but only based on my assertion that it should be better.  Jay
 Ellis has done about the same thing I have for his 951 and reports much
 improved torque on the track compared to 951S at Summit Point. 
 
 Of all these opinions, including my own, only one is track specific for 
 951's, or at least indicates that.  
 
 I've heard many, many folks say that the stock mufflers are so good that
 nothing else, including a straight pipe will do better.  But wait.  Why 
 did the factory Turbo Cup cars have a different muffler, as indicated in
 Jay Ellis' post?  Hmm. 
 
 Here's my theory:

 Engines are air pumps.  The easier the air goes in and out, the higher the
 efficiency of the pump.  A secondary effect however, is the mass flow of
 air down the exhaust can produce a flow effect which helps to scavenge the
 cylinder before the piston begins to come up and force the exhaust out. 
 This effect can be pretty beneficial and is perhaps best illustrated by
 the concept of longer intake runners employed on many high performance
 cars (although on the opposite side of the cylinder)--the air rushes
 through the pipe as a large mass which has a tendency to maintain speed. 
 Of course, it's the exhaust pipe which harnesses this flow, not the
 muffler. 
  
 The two other factors, of course, are weight and sound.  A straight pipe 
 probably saves on the order of 40 pounds.  And the sound is such that 
 it's easier to hear when the car is beginning to rev a little too freely, 
 indicating more wheel spin than you might want.  (Of course, with LSD, 
 you typically feel wheelspin as a lateral force.  Even so, I still 
 like the sound to reinforce the feeling.) 
 
 So what's best?  I dunno for sure.  I believe in the straight pipe for
 many reasons, but Pasha's concerns about the DME are interesting.  It
 might be a good idea to take the two pipes on my 944 S2 and compare
 with a g-analyzer.  (I've moved the exhaust onto my S2.)  Use say a second
 gear test from steady state throttle at 2000 rpm up to redline, best of
 three tests, to see which is best.  This is also a good test for airfilter
 performance.  Since K&N offers no filter for the S2, I've custom built one
 which I believe will give higher flow, at the expense of getting dirty
 much quicker.  (It's a race car, I'll just have to clean and/or replace
 more often.) I'll post the results when I'm done.

Hello, LTDES,

BTW, did you AOLers know that you can type your real name so we can know
who these cryptic userids translate to... :-)

Anyhow, you might be able to buy the cover for the seat bottom. But probably
not.  I did look at the price list for a couple and the fabric itself for
the bottom only came to a whopping $323.  

My advice is to locate a good seat at a swap meet that might be a good donor
of material, or just a replacement...

You might be able to find a perfect match.

In the meantime, you might consider some SeatSavers (if they are still made,
anyone know?).  I had a 1980 Scirocco with some fabric seats that the left
side bottom bolster wore out on and used the products.  They were real good
at hiding the problem...

Good luck...

Well, of course, value is determined by a couple of factors, among them,
supply, demand, condition, history, options, availability of maintenance
records, color and the size of the wallet of the prospective purchaser :-)

That having been said, I have seen a 1988 Turbo S, 40 K miles, white with
Burgundy Leather (yes, it was available in late 88 with other than the rose
and plaid), and in excellent condition sell in 1993 for 16K dollars, US.

I have also seen 88 Turbo S cars trade in 1995 for 22K dollars, US. 

That was here in the Northeast USA, where you can drive them for only  6 or
7 months out of the year...

I would guess that your car is worth between 12K and 22K at this time,
depending on the above factors. More detailed information would tend to
narrow down the range of the estimate.

Bert, if you want a closer valuation of what the car is worth up here, send
me something offline with a lot more detail, and I can give you a closer
number.

Subject: 914 Valve Adjust

        One more 914 question/sanity check from this weekend:
The idea behind getting the piston at TDC to do a valve adjust is
to get on the "round" section of the cam--i.e., the part that isn't
calling for any valve opening.  This should also be where the valve
clearance is the greatest, right?
        The reason I'm asking is:  I put #1 at TDC by using the '0'
mark on the fan, and the notch on the flywheel (which, BTW, seem to
be about 0.5-1.0 degrees apart...)  I then checked and adjusted #1.
Rotate the crank 180 degrees; hey!  Paint mark on both fan and fly-
wheel!  Cool!  Did #4 (I think it was), etc.  At one point, I poked
a feeler gauge into a valve gap for a piston not at TDC--the other
valve was depressed.  The gap was bigger, by about .002 or so!  I
re-checked both valves back at TDC, and they were fine!
        Does the stock 914 (2.0) cam go "negative" anywhere?  If not,
what the heck did I do?
        Thanks!

With experience, I have no doubt that this method will do. However, as a 
beginner I found it difficult to judge the tightness strictly from the 
washer. Therefore, I found the method of feeling for actual play, with a 
tire installed to be more accurate and reassuring.

As for other cars, my old BMW specified a torque for the  castellated nut 
after which you backed it off to the next slot you could insert the 
cotter pin. The procedure for my Mercedes (which has the same nut as my 
Porsche) is a little different. If I recall correctly, you tighten the 
nut until you can no longer move the wheel. Then you unscrew it a certain 
number of degrees and tighten the allen screw. Finally you give the hub a 
sharp whack to release the tension.
 
As for what 'shops do', after seeing the work some of them have done 
for me (or done to me?) in the past, I've come to question some of their 
methods and practices. Of course, this is not to say there aren't good 
shops out there but they seem to be the minority.

North Hollywood Speedometer) and get them to replace the big red warning 
light in the upper quadrant of the fuel-guage with an oil-temperature 
gauge.  While you're at it, make sure the gauge is calibrated in 
degrees.

Next, have them modify a 911 Turbo tachometer to replace the boost gauge 
with oil-pressure.  It'll take a little recalibration and a new tach 
silkscreen, but the final results are well worth the effort; oil 
pressure will be displayed in the center of your tach, right where you 
can most easily see it.

This whole procedure cost me only a couple hundred dollars through North 
Hollywood; I don't have their phone number handy, but they advertise in 
Pano.

Joe -

As far as shops are concerned, no doubt some of them fail in their 
ability and you just have to find one you like if necessary.  With a 
number of shops around me in the San Francisco bay area, some people 
don't like one but then others just rave about that same shop.  It is up 
to you who you can trust and who you can't.  I haven't heard many (if any 
I can remember) complaints about people loosing wheel bearings/hubs very 
frequently from a shops mis-adjustment.  Maybe this adjustment isn't as 
critical as you are making it.

With regrads to your methods on various other cars, I could sit here and 
find faults with those methods too.  A few come to mind quickly.  Again, 
use what you feel comfortable with.  Yes, the wheel method is what we 
commonly use to tech cars for autocrosses, time trials or drivers events 
only becuase it is simpler.  Realize though, that with the "wheel" you are 
going to feel a little more play then you would see from the 
"screwdriver" because of the leverage/distance you are working with.  Now 
where do you draw the line.  Again, it's a feel you have to just do and 
get use to.  Go out to a drivers event some time and work tech.  You 
would be suprised at the differences from car to car.

        For those of you amused by strange electrical problems - This
weekend I was preparing for a club tour by rigging up a CB in the Targa.  I
haven't used a CB in the 911 before, but the tour leaders are going to use
them to keep track of folks on the road, and since I have a pile of old CBs,
figgured I may as well "have ears on".  So I put a new connector on an old
clip-on antenna, jammed a piece of folded paper into the cigar lighter
alongside the old (smaller diameter) cigar lighter attachment to hold it in
place, and walah, it worked.  The problem is that when I key the mike, the
windshield wipers come on.

        When I finished laughing I, I went to pull the wiper fuse to "solve"
the problem (this is a one-time thing), and found that the cigar lighter,
and wiper circuit share the same fuse.  I guess keying the mike feeds back
into the power circuit and trigger the wiper motor as if you had used the
w/s washer.  I wonder if using the cigar lighter also cycles the wipers
(didn't think to try it).

greetings all.....hope march is going along merrily!

I've put off my 60,000 mile as long as possible (not really that long!) and
I figured I might as well make the spring mods to the car at the same time.

I've chipped the car with a custom chip from the 944S2s in the firehawk
series. I've also added a Bursh exhaust (great addition, really made the
car sound good, as well as giving noticeable better response and better gas
mileage)

I dislike moving part changes like camshafts, compression changes as they
raise the maintenance of the car.

Any ideas? Would a different manifold also improve response time? How about
a bigger anti-sway bar then the stock one for the rear or front? Do you
need to do both at the same time?

I have about $500....Any advice would really be appreciated. Let me know if
you want any more information....

In poor Andy's defense, there was an interview in Panorama a

article about the "untouchables" in the 911 design, like the
"widows peak" front window line and the rear window lines. He
and others at Porsche had wanted to redesign the car for better
air flow etc. and the "buying public" (like us) wouldn't let

Subject: 356 rear bearing question.


This is for the 356 guys that were working on the rear bearings.

Over the weekend, I got it into my head that I would change the
rear bearings that the axle go through on my type I VW.  After reading 
up on the procedure, I found that there is a special tool to use with 
fingers that grab the inside of the race and use the end of the axle 
to press against (looked _alot_ like what has been discussed here for the
356 job).  Well, I took the cover off, just to look at the job
anyways.

Once I was looking eye to eye with the bearing, I figgured I would add
some grease to the bearings and worry about the change later.  To add
the grease, I used a greasegun with a needle to put the grease in the
bearing, working my way around the bearing between the rollers.  

Now, here's the importain stuff, as I added the grease, the bearing
started to wiggle its way out.  After a few more pumps, I was able to
remove the bearing by hand.  After cleaning, I found them to be in
good shape, repacked them, and reinstalled them.

So, is there anychance this grease-preasure-removal method will help
any of you 356 people?  I know that my VW is several years newer, but
there still might be a chance that this will help.

Diagnosed Porschephiliacs,
	I checked on that odd corvair engined 914 and it was only a "4" 
not a "6" as he had hoped.  He said the possibility of it being a six was 
the only reason he didn't get rid of it, the car has few parts valuable 
to a mechanic (weird engine, badly rusted body).  He then asked if I was 
interested in buying it.  He said he'd tow it to my garage for $500.  I 
thought about it for about, oh, 5 seconds and agreed to it.  
	Some of the cool things it has:
                       Five bolt vented discs (need to be turned),  wide 
(don't know exactly) minilite style wheels with polished outers and gold 
painted inners,  crazy looking(??)heavy duty rear suspension that flare  
the wheels out about 5 inches, Koni shocks, nice interior w/ real 
leather seats but cracked dashpad, fiberglass front/rear flares (one fell 
off it was so rusted around it! still have all 4 though), and complete 
(from what I can see) Corvair flat six conversion.  I think the clutch is 
bad, that's probably the reason its in a repair yard.  
	What I need:  I'm going to try to find a 914 with a decent body 
but bad engine/ interior to swap all my stuff into.  Is it worth it or 
did I buy a pile of worthless junk?  I love to tinker with cars, and if 
it's not worth swapping into a good body, I'll just get it running in its 
present rusty shape and have one fast 914 that looks like sh*t.  About 
the 912E, its still sitting in the shop waiting for winter season (lax 
time for mechanics here) to come again so he can chop it.  That STILL 
makes me sick, but at least I have a new toy.  Advice would be 
appreciated.  CU  :^)

My comment on shops was meant as a general one on all repairs. For 
example, my local Porsche dealer does not use the P9201 tool for checking 
belt tension. Given that there are probably some mechanics which can do 
it properly by feel, surely not EVERY mechanic at this place which would 
change a 944 belt has that skill. 

Wouldn't it be great if all mechanics worked on their customers' cars 
with the same care and attention they would use on their own car?

I'm sure they have faults too. However, those other methods came from the 
Haynes manuals for those cars (which in turn I assume they get from the 
manufacturer).

Like you said, one should use whatever method  they feel most comfortable 
with. But it never hurts to hear other points of views...

Since you didn't mention driver education on your list, I cast my vote for 
improving the driver.  $500 would go a long way around here to making your
car F*A*S*T...

Other than that, on your particular car, $500 will not do anything to
measurably improve performance...Leave it alone and modify the primary input
device...

Subject: 944 Technical Session - Tech Tactics

If you don't own a 944, stop here...

If you do, I'll pass along a couple of items of interest that came about
during the Zone 1 Tech Tactics, held this past weekend in Springfield, Mass.

Tom Charlesworth, the PCA National Tech Committee Chair for 924/944 cars,
and one of the Stewards for PCA Club Racing, came from Tulsa to cover our
beloved water-cooled autos.

First, he stunned the audience by displaying a broken crankshaft from a 944.
Seems that the clutch's rubber center had come apart and had not been
repaired by the owner for a year or so.  Eventually all the banging in there
caught her attention, and she brought it in. After fixing the clutch, there
was still a noise from the motor. Tom figured it out after moving the
flywheel (front to rear) and not seeing the crank pulleys move.  The shaft
had fractured from the constant knocking on it... Fix your clutches now...

Number 2 rod bearings were covered.  Scared the bejesus out of me. I have
ordered my set and a set of connecting rod bolts to do my job now.  $100 in
parts, should take me about 2-3 hours if I don't have any problems... My
particular concern is that I have about 300 track hours on my 83 and have
never dropped the pan... I'll post a followup to let you know how it goes...

More on #2 Rod Bearings:  Seems that 928 cars with the 4.7 litre motors have
a similar problem. May be a crankshaft design problem, but more study is
being done by the tech committee... Also, the problem seems to be related to 
high engine revs (greater than 6000 rpm) rather than high power output.

Aluminum Control Arms: Still breaking, several suppliers of problem fixes
were mentioned at the meeting (if you want the names, send me your PCA
Membership Number and your email address...:-)

Oil Cooler Failures: Still happening.

Clutch Upgrades: For stock 944s, recommended to continue with rubber center
clutch. For Turbos, upgrade to Turbo Cup Clutch.  For now, stay away from 
carbon fiber clutches (let someone else be the guinea pig...)

CV Joints: clean, repack, and re-orient early, and they will last twice as
long. Let them wear too much before you do the job, and they will knock on
deceleration...

Camshaft Carrier Leaks: The O-ring at the front of the cam swells and
obstructs a drain hole, causing leaks front and rear.  Easy fix...

Cracking Dashes: They all do that...   :-)

Engine Oil: use the stock filter - Porsche filters have a relief valve that
is backwards from most designs.  Good engine oil combination is 50/50 mix of
conventional oil and Mobil 1. (Slipperiest combination).

1986 Turbo Transmissions: 3rd gear is pressed onto the mainshaft and will 
spin (break) on cars with more than stock horsepower. Fix is to replace with
1987 Turbo or later Transmission.

That's all I can remember for now. If I think of something else, I'll post
later...

Good luck,

Subject: Maintenance Records


What is everyone's opinion about purchasing a pre-owned 911 which was
bought through an auction and doesn't have any maintenance records and
an unknown history?

Over the weekend, I looked at an '88 Carrera.  It looked good and
drove well, but being a Porsche novice I'm not sure if that means
a lot.  I guess what I want to know is opinions about how important
the history of the car is.  Obviously knowing how the car has been
treated in the past would be helpful in determining how reliable it
will be in the future.  But even as the dealer suggested, maintenance
records can lie.

Would a Porsche mechanic be able to determine how well the car has been
maintained during a pre-purchase inspection?  Is staying away from
a car without any documentation a bit too drastic?  Or am I asking for
trouble without any history?

Thanks...

Andrew,

Didn't T*d make a career here for a brief while stating his personal
beliefs as *ABSOLUTE*  *UNASSAILABLE* fact?  I am of course interested
in your *opinions* and would probably welcome them as such.

Everyone on the list is fully aware of the 911's complete list of
*features*.  The 911 owners love their 911's in spite of and in some cases
because of those features--some even love their cars because of the way they
*look*.  Of the many reasons not to own a 911 ****IMHO***, they way they look
is not among them.

BTW, I agree, Tim probably shouldn't buy the 911. If you have to ask, then the
answer is no.  Not because he can't afford it--maybe he can. It's just that I
can't imagine "sort of wanting a 911".  Same as you can't be a little bit
pregnant.

I wouldn't buy a 911 with metrics: cost of ownership, price/performance,
0-60,etc. I have never once bought a sports car using any cost-justifiable
criteria. I have never bought one yet that I could actually afford!  I bought
every sports car and motorcycle I've owned because I *had* to have it. End of
story.

Tim, buy a car that makes you smile every time you drive it.  Buy one that you
love so much you don't care if it breaks because it's just another opportunity
to make it better.  If you can't do that, don't buy a sports car!!!

Speaking of which, the MR2 is extremely expensive to service because of 
the mid-engine layout.

I knew a guy who had an MR2, and he was always complaining about how 
expensive it was to do any service- you had to pull the whole engine out 
for nearly anything. Needless to say, he sold the MR2.

If you want cheap, you don't want a sports car. Get a Toyota Corolla, 
Nissan Sentra, Honda Civic, Dodge Neon, Saturn, something like that.

Hi Gary, (and Bob)

I find the theory that styrofoam *drys out* interesting.  I can understand 
some breakdown due to oxidation and/or u.v., but that should be minor in a 
properly stored helmet.  Even if there is a chemical change over time, does 
it effect the energy-absorbing qualities enough to warrant tossing the 
helmet?  Fill me in on this, please.

I concur that once you bonk the lid it should get tossed.

I have a spare Targa top that I purchased from a neighbor and used on my '88
until I got my original top recovered. Now it's taking up space in the already
over crowded garage and if anyone out there has need for it, such a deal I would
make for you! I believe it came off of a '76 or '77 car and differs from the '88
top primarily in that the header bar that attaches to the windshield frame. It
uses the double hook style latches as opposed to the newer style roller latches.
(I swapped out the header bars while using it)  I don' know when this design
change took place, but I'm thinking that it might fit pre-'86 (?). Both skin and
headliner are in great shape, although it's missing the front locating pins. I
paid $250 for it and would sell for that plus whatever it costs to ship. Let me

Plan on costs on the order of $1000 per year and you will probably be safe. 
(If you don't know what "on the order of" means, check with your local
statistician...)

If you maintain the car yourself, then all that you have to worry about are
parts costs, which can run $500 in a good year, $5000 in a bad year. Add the
cost of a mechanic's boat if you do not maintain the car yourself.

There, that should cover it.

BTW, my average cost per year for my 83 944 is $300 per year for maintenance.
Lots of oil, grease, soap and wax. Not many parts...

And, oh, don't forget to budget the $36 per year for the Porsche Club dues,
and your $50 for porschephiles...

Good luck,

You asked me where I read to set the fuel pressure regulator to 1.5 psi

*can* read (don't tell my boss). 

Seriously,

The 1.5 setting comes from experience with T1 VWs in brush buggies.  Lots
of bouncing around over uneven territory tendend to cause "float bounce"
which would increase the fuel level in the bowls to unacceptable levels.
A lower pressure setting *seemed* to ameliorate the problem.  'Course,

Of course, one must do some form of budgeting to accomodate ownership of
any vehicle. Budgeting for a Porsche however enters entirely different
strata. For a younger person, insurance alone may be prohibitively
expensive, if not downright unobtainable at any price. I could never
recommend a 15 year old Porsche (or any other 15 year old automobile for
that matter) to someone who is primarily concerned with maintainence and
repair costs.  Old cars break! Old Porsches break and are incredibly
expensive to repair.  This I know as fact.

If money is the main issue, then don't buy a Porsche. If passion is the
issue, then go for it regardless of the budget!  Passion has ruled my life,
frequently to my chagrin. But I'll always own a Porsche!

No, I'm not in a position to disregard monitary issues.  I wish I could
though because I'd have me one of them new 4WD 993 Turbos!  Ahh to dream. .

Subject: Re: metal polishing question

Eric,
   When polishing metal using cloth wheels I clean the cloth wheel
using a buffing rake about once every ten minutes. This exposes fresh new 
cloth with plenty of hair. A stiff wire brush might work, but it shouldn't 
flex. A buffing rake can be easily made by cutting teeth into a 4" x 6" 
piece of 18 gauge sheet steel. Teeth should be cut as such  ^^^^^^^^
Screw the metal to an 18" peice of 1x3 and that's it. You can purchase 
the buff rake teeth for $4 from suppliers.

   When appplying compound to the wheel, allow the compound to heat up by 
placing it against the buff turning at full speed. As the compound melts, 
slow the buff down by applying firmer pressure. Keep the buff turning at 
low speed by continuing the pressure or toggling the on/off switch. The 
object is to get a good layer of compound across the face of the buff 
without it flying off. Switch the buffer off for a few seconds to allow the 
compound the cool. Repeat about every 2-3 minutes. Never mix compounds
on the same buff wheel. Finish your work by buffing with a new wheel
and white rouge to bring out the best color.

   Try using a "felt bob" mounted on a 1/4" shaft for more intricate 
areas. "Razor buffs" are used to obtain polished edges and flanges. They
are generally constructed of several layers of rigid fabric that provide
a face about 3/8" wide. I used razor buffs to polish all the flange areas 
on a stainless steel exhaust with dual mufflers and resonators.

Did anyone else see the ESPN coverage of the race? I thought that ESPN did an
excellent job of covering this race, much better than the 24 hours of
Daytona.

The in car shots of the Hans Stuck car were incredible. The screen was split
into three parts, one view out the window, another view of telemetry data
consisting of speed, RPM, gear, and braking, and a final view of the car
position on the track. ESPN had some great shots of him driving absolutely
flat out in the rain. The amount of work he did was amazing. Every few
minutes he had to wipe the windshield with a rag to stop it from fogging. All
this while trying (and suceeding) to pass the class leading Nisson.

One question, each time Stuck shifted, there was a strange sound from the
car. It almost sounded like the wheels would spin with each shift, or maybe
the gears would grind a little (wasn't the gearbox a synromesh unit?). Does
anyone know what the noise was?

 There is one minor difference from the auto H4's you might want to know

do, they dip straight down on low beam.  The only problem I can see is they
won't illuminate the shoulder quite as well.  I've never used them in a 4

Good luck with them, the price sounds right enough especially if they include

Just a small note...

Helmet manufacturers would prefer that you send "used" helmets back to 
them, rather than throwing them away... They like to analyze the damage 
so they can improve the next generation.  Many manufacturers will even 
cover the shipping costs associated with returning damaged halmets.

Subject: Carrera RS & RSCS details

Carrera RS details.  Press release from Porsche Cars Australia.

Porsche's new Carrera RS - the most potent and exclusive expression of the classic 911
model - has arrived in Australia.

Eighteen of the lightweight, 300 Hp performance models, collectively worth nearly
$4 million will be envied on Australian roads and racing circuits this year.  The entire
1995 allocation has been pre-sold.

Based on the new 993 series 911 Carrera launched in Australia last year, the 911 Carrera
RS weighs 100 kilograms less, is fitted with a larger bore 3.8 litre six cylinder engine
producing 221 kW (300 Hp) and features race-developed aerodynamics, even bigger
brakes and competition tuned suspension.

It is being produced in two road registerable configurations : "RS Touring", with minimal
trimming and comfort equipment, and "RSCS (Clubsport) " - an even more spartan version
designed for production based motor racing.

The Australian price of the 911 Carrera RSCS is $218,000 and the RS Touring is $207,000.

Initial work at Porsche has concentrated on building the 100 RSCS models needed for
homologation to FIA GT2 requirements.

Unlike the normal RS model, the Clubsport has no linings or insulating materials and the
entire interior is painted in the body colour.  It features additional safety equipment for
racing including a front suspension brace, lightweight bucket seats with six point
harnesses, a fire extinguisher and a battery "kill" switch.  A modified, high downforce
front spoiler and an adjustable rear aerofoil, which incorporates air intakes for the engine
compartment, completes the road or track package.  10 of these vehicles have been sold
to Australian customers and all arrived in early March, with most having a racing destiny.

Production of a further 1000 RS Touring models has already begun at Porsche, with
Australian deliveries due in June.

Weights of both models are RS Touring 1270 kg and RSCS  1235 kg.

Deleted in the new RS are power windows, electrically adjustable mirrors, central locking,
headlamp cleaning system, intermittent wiper setting and sound system speakers.  The
windscreen washer reservoir holds only 1.2 litres instead of 6.5l, while the sophisticated
interior lighting system of the standard model has been replaced by a small lamp from the
911 Speedster.  The use of thin pane windows and the elimination of the rear window
defroster have saved a further five kilograms, while the Aluminium bonnet (hood) saves
a further 7.5 kg.  The shell style leather upholstered bucket seats are painted the same
colour as the body and saves a further 30 kg, insulation has been reduced to a minimum
and the doors are fitted with simple linings and are opened and closed by means of a loop
and a light handle.

The extra capacity from 3.6 litres has been achieved by increasing the bore from 100 to 102 mm,
while power has increased from 200 kW (272 Hp) and torque is now 355 Nm at 5,400 rpm.
Some major advances have been achieved by modifying the engine's air ducting.  Using a
system called "varioram", Porsche engineers managed to raise both max. engine power
while also enhancing mid-range torque.  This endows the RS with the dual blessings of
max. power for racing and max. tractability for traffic operation.  Large intake and exhaust
valves and modified camshafts and timing, complete the engine modifications.

The RS Carrera features a modified six speed gearbox from the 911 Carrera, with the ratio
of the first three gears raised to complement racing use. The new double-cone syncromesh
for first and second gear reduced shifting effort by nearly 40% compared to the previous
model.

The RS is 30 mm lower at the front and 40 mm lower at the rear than the 993.  To adapt the car
to different driving applications, there is a choice of five settings on the front stabilisers and
up to three on the rear.  The Dynamic Driving differential lock available as an option on the 993
is standard on the RS.  This system provides additional stability and consists of two
elements - the automatic brake differential (ABD) and a mechanical transverse rear-axle
lock, both of specifically adjusted for the RS.  Despite weighing an extra 7 kg power steering
remains a standard feature on the RS, although the steering force required from the driver
has been increased to enhance feel.

The 911 Carrera RS is shod with 225/40 ZR 18 front and 265/35 ZR 18 rear tyres, mounted on
RS Cup Design eight and ten inch rims respectively.  Braking tests have shown the RS takes
just 2.7 seconds to stop from 100 km/h.  Race proved four-piston fixed-caliper aluminium
brakes act on huge 322 mm discs all round, compared to the 304 mm front and 299 rear discs
of the 993.  The standard ABS 5 system has been optimised for a shorter braking distance on
uneven roads due to improved control efficiency, with reduced feedback pulsing of the pedal
during ABS operation.

Dream on Pfilers.

I don't know the exact process, but apparently when they expand the
polystyrene to make styrofoam, they do it by bubbleing a gas like
freon (or some EPA approved equivalent) through it.  And the trapped
gas is what makes it rebound.

After time, this gas leaks out, and the foam "dries out", making it
brittle.

And I suppose that if you stored your helmet in an air tight bag, it
would last a much longer time.  But who does that?

Three years may lean towards the "better safe than sorry" side.  But
there is no non-destructive way to test a helmet.

Yes, that was me that said that....

Bell was the company that was famous for that.  They used to call it
a "free safety inspection", but everyone I talked to had gotten their
helmet replaced because it flunked.  Once they got enough used helmets,
they stopped doing it.

Andrew - quick summary of my costs for the last 2 years (80k miles)

OIL - Castrol synthetic 40 ltrs - 240 pounds
MAINT KITS X 8 - 320 pounds
CAM & BAL BELTS X 2 - 130 pounds
TYRES X 4 - 500 pounds
STEERING ROD + BEARING - 150 pounds
ANTIFREEZE - 20 pounds (got a leaky rad)
VARIOUS bulbs and fuses - 20 pounds

I have a couple of outstanding maint tasks to do -
NEW ENG MOUNTS - 250 pounds
CAM BELTS - 65 pounds
MINOR TRIM ITEMS - 80 pounds

thats it - 1800 pounds for 80k = 2.2 pence per mile - say 4 cents

now add in fuel at 6 miles/ltr = 13333 ltrs @ 55p/ltr = 7333 pounds

insurance 800 pounds/year = 1600 pounds

The original car 85/944 cost 6500 pounds
- ----------------------------------------------------

as you can see maint costs are dwarfed by fuel and insurance

Yes, styrofoam takes approximately 500 years to degrade to a significant 
point. But, I wonder, how would UV get a chance to affect it? 
(Interesting that styrofoam, that which allows such evils to get through 
our atmosphere would be affected by them) Sunlight would have to hit the 
interior of the helmet, and if you're just careful with it and sit it up 
right outside, you shouldn't have any problems.

Yes, since styrofoam is made of compressable air pockets, it'll be

Greetings fellow Porsche dwellers,
	I have been reading the posts on whether or not for some guy (?) 
to buy a Toyota or a Porsche, and have decided to come out of the closet 
and reveal that, yes, I own a Toy.  It's a 1980 Corolla 2-door with 
321,000 miles on the odometer.  Original untouched engine & 5-speed, 
I use it to commute in the summer (924 has no AC) or on the rare occasion 
when my P-car is in need of repair.  This car has been abused for many 
years by my sister, and it just keeps going.  
	My criteria for the decision is this: If he wants a car that 
takes a lickin and keeps on tickin (cliche, I know) get a Toyota.  If he 
wants a car that will thrill his emotions and demand care and maintenance 
as well as some money, get a Porsche.  IMHO, either will be an excellent 
car!

Dear Jeff, 

Lowering the 914 front end is easy and rewarding if you have height
differential. It is important to first replace the rear springs to establish
proper initial height. From there we adjust the front height to match the
rear.

Front height is measured in the front by subtracting the height from the rear
center torsion bar cap to the ground from the center of the wheel cap to the
ground. The height left to right should be the same.

Seat of the pants adjustment (on a level surface) is as follows:
     1. Measure from the lower tip of the rear quarter panel to the ground on
the left and right sides.
     2. Measure from the rear tip of the front fender to the ground on both
sides.
     3. Raise or lower the front end to match the rear measurement.
     4. Soak the torsion bar adjusting screws with WD 40.
     5. If lowering, unscrew both 11mm bolts or allen adjusting screws one
turn.
     6. Bounce on both fenders to settle the car and remeasure.
     7. If still too high, crank both screws one quarter turn and then bounce
to settle and remeasure.
     8. Repeat the procedure until proper height is achieved.
     9. If the front is too low, you need to first take the weight off the
torsion bars with a floorjack under the cross member before screwing in the
adjusters. Repeat the procedure as above as you adjust up.

Remember, do not take this procedure out of context. This seat of the pants
adjustment has nothing to do with corner balancing or torsion bar tension or
height, just body level. Many factors influence overall height, four corner
balance and spring/torsion bar tension. Beware!

Dear Keith,

A 1971 914-6 is worth much more than a 1970 914-6 as they only made 443 of
them in comparison to 2,668 '70 models! For a rust free example, $9-10K is a

Dear Dave,

If your 914 engine case does not have a serial number (and remember 1.7,1.8
models number is at the rear top just to the right of center while the 2.0
models (and VW buses) are in the crevas between the oil filler and the front
impellor housing) then it has had a factory new replacement case at one time.
Since all cases are basically the same, with work they can interchange. I'm
sure the rebuilder use the proper one for your engine.

Dear Rick,

Various colors are still available in the factory pack. Among them is your
Rally or Phoenix red color.

However, if not available, a good auto body paint store can mix your touch up
from the paint number in the left front door jamb plate. Your color is L-32K.

The best all around tire for the factory Pedrinni alloy originally fitted
optionally to 70-73 914 1.7 models is a 195/65x15. It is not the widest that
will fit, but the one to give overall best performance.

The Pedrinni alloy was originally painted by the factory and if dingey, can
be repainted with Porsche silver color (which is about like dull aluminum).

Your low-end Toyotas are, indeed, extremely beatable, but is the same true for
the high-end sportabouts?  Can you really expect to be able to beat the car to
death every day, leave it parked on the street, feed it cheap gas and change
the oil every spring and fall and still expect it to be reliable.  I know the
old Corollas seemed to thrive, or at least hold up well, under such treatment,
but I can't see redlining an MR2 through every gear every time the light
changed on 87 octane and "Bubba's Best" 30-wt and still having no problems.

Well, enough run-on sentences.  I just wanted to say that I don't think that
reliability should be a consideration when purchasing a sports car.  If you
take car of your car, either a Porsche or a Toyota will be reliable; if you
don't, then neither will be.

Junk food for thought!

Hi,

        An opportunity(?) has presented itself. A local garage has a '68 912 
for sale, in a "to be restored condition". While I am looking for a long 
term project car, I have no experience with pre '74 Porsches in general and 
912's specifically. Shop is asking a $1000, here is *currently known* condition:

        Floor is supposedly rusted (have not seen extent for myself)
        no engine/trans in car
        no wheels
        rust spot on engine lid (paint bubbled up)
        rust spot on hood (paint bubbled up)
        rust spot bottom corner of windshield frame (paint bubbled up)
        suspension/steering/brakes appears all present and attached
        external body looks good (no ripples in body, no strange outlines in 
paint)
        supposedly never wrecked / no bondo on car

main reason I am giving this such a closer look is that the interior has all 
ready been redone:

        new (looking) carpet
        new leather seats
        dash top and front/face look new
        instruments complete and look refurb'd
        door panels and internal trim has been replaced / refurb'd
        has A/C hookups (this IS an issue in Houston as it would be a daily 
driver)

        I have somehow (WAG) came up with around $8k as being the number 
required to get this thing into a very good mechanical/structurally correct 
*daily driver*, not a show car. Have I been taking one of our list members' 
pills without a prescription again? About how far off is that $ number?

        Now, if the general consensus of the net gods is that this looks 
like an acceptable situation, can someone give recommendations on a (Houston 
area) shop to do the cutting/welding on at least a new floor pan? Final 
painting of the car? Source of mechanical tidbits that are 912 specific?

Andrew,
	How long is a piece of string?
There is no way of predicting maintenance costs because basically all cars and 
all drivers are different.  Oil changes at every 3k, and TLC go a long way to 
preserve the condition of the car, and it has been my experience that the 
exterior of a vehicle does give something away about the general mechanical 
condition, also.
	So what do you mean by 'ongoing maintenance' I own a 944 with 138,000 
miles on it and strong compression tests show that the vehicle is just nicely 
run-in.  Get a car which looks good, and has a service history so you can check 
on the things which have been mentioned on this net, such as motor mounts, 
oilcooler, driveshafts and timing belt/tensioner replacement at the expected or 
required intervals.
	Another big issue is whether you can do any 'spannering' yourself.  I 
bought my 944 with (complete with needs engine work tag) with an estimate of 
$2500 for an engine rebuild. 
	Now and $340 later, I am driving said 944 around, so the gamble paid off.

Your $8k estimate sounds low.  Rust repair eats up a lot of dollars quickly.
We recently got estimates for rustoration and repaint of a '75 914 (a major
portion of this job was serious floorpan replacement): bids ranged around
$7k.  Then you've the matter of the missing engine, transaxle, and all the
various accouterments that hook to the engine (carbs, generator,
distributor, A/C system, oil cooler, etc).  I have no idea what all this
would cost for a 912, but let's guess and say you could find all of it used
but servicable for $3k (someone out there will correct me :-).  Next, add an
additional $2k in misc. stuff--brake system rebuild, fixing the inevitable
electrical gremlins, wheels, tires, shocks, and whatever else you don't know
about until it breaks.  I think a optimistic estimate of your rebuild costs
is closer to $12k.

I think you'd be better off to look for a complete, running automobile to
drive. Even using your estimate of $9k for this car, I expect you could find
a reasonably nice, running '68 912.  You might consider this one for a parts
car, though.  If the external panels are straight and not too badly eaten up
by rust, they and the interior might be worth the $1000 the shop is asking.

That's my 2c anyway.

Yup,  That's the latest news that I've seen.  I recall a statement that
it would cost around $5 million to run the two cars at LeMans.  Too much
money for only one race (that you can win only if the competition don't

Subject: 914 autox and handling fun

Hi all,

The cast: me and my  74 914 2.0L
The location: McClelan AFB, SCCA SFR #2&3

	My brakes are done, and I got to give them the real test 
at this weekends two day autox event at McClelan AFB. I 
couldnt really determine how they were going to work on the 
first day as it was raining in the morning and I was in the 
first run group, although it was alot of fun slipping and 
sliding in the wet. But the second day was dry, and I was 
able to see where my brakes were working and where there 
wernt. I still need to do some work, the front left locks up 
before the right, and I probably couldnt get the rears to 
lock if I tried. The new system is a 19mm master with 
carbon/kevlar pads, and new rotors. Any suggestions beyond 
the neccessary rebuild of the front calipers?
	
	The autox was a blast. The wet, although frustrating, 
was a blast. What was frustrating was that I couldnt tell 
what was wrong. I couldnt manage to get the rear around on 
the gas unless I got really drastic. Not spin, just rotate. 
The only time I found I could get the car to rotate was on 
trailing throttle. Wow! It was great, the car would whip 
around and lock right into position. But because this was 
only on trailing throttle, I lost time. Lots of time. Yeah 
theres other factors too, like my driving just has to get 
better first. But wait, theres more. On the next day it was 
warm and dry for our run group. We had five runs, and on the 
first three runs, once again, I couldnt figure out what in 
the world I was doing wrong. I was trying so hard to drive 
the car the way I -thought- and -knew- the car should handle, 
that I was ignoring the obvious. It wasnt until after my 
third run, that I paid closer attention to tire temps. The 
rears were even across the tread but the fronts were cold on 
the inside. Aha! Well that should tell me something. Too much 
toe in? Not enough camber? Understeer! DUH! Of course! Once 
that had FINALLY occured to me, I was suprised that I hadnt 
caught on earlier. I should have spotted that on the first 
run, but I was so caught up on testing the brakes and trying 
to get the car to handle the way I -thought- it could, that 
it didnt even cross my mind. Well, having no adjustable 
suspension, and no front sway bar (not for much longer), all 
I had was tire preasures. So I added four pounds to the front 
and bingo! Three seconds off my time. Doh! If I had noticed 
that earilier, I could have spent my time on improving my 
driving rather that fighting my car. I probably could have 
used more in the front still, but I ran out of runs. First 
official autox of the season for me, I gota get my brain 
working faster than that.
	Out on the course, everyone was noticing the hideous 
body roll my car was exhibiting. Well, once I had a couple of 
pieces, the rest all fell into place. The understeer was most 
likely a result of having totally shot rear stock springs. 
And the massive body roll was probably covering up some 
of the feel of the understeer. So the question I pose to 
anyone whos actually perseveered through all of my autox 
drivel is, what do you think my next course of action should 
be with the suspension. So far my plan would be to go for 
140lb rear springs and a front sway bar. If I had a bigger 
wallet, I would throw in the koni shocks and the torsion bars 
too. But Im on a bit of a limited budget. Id like to do 
something before the April 2nd drivers school, but I cant 
afford to go all out yet. Also, any suggestions to 
get the brakes better balanced? Thanks...

BTW, Im running in SCCA CSP-R class, so I gotta obey the 
rules.

There was a recent inquiry about what kind of brake fluid to
use on a early 912.  I used the Castrol LMA GTX brake fluid, I think
the LMA means "low moisture activated" or something like that.
Its a dot 4 if I remember correctly and works with dot 3 fluids.

After witnessing and later assisting with bleeding a 'vette with
silicon fluids, I wouldnt touch that stuff if you paid me.  It was
miserable bleeding silicon, not to mention expensive!

Anyway, that's my 2 cents worth,

GEICO isn't available in NJ, so I can't insure my 911 with them.  Its a
shame considering its costing me a backbreaking $800 per year. :-)

Granted, I have higher deductibles ($1K) and its an '85 (lower cost), but
Northern NJ has the highest overall rates in the USA _again_.

Our coverage sounds mostly comperable except that I have a "pleasure only"
rating, but I have NO MILEAGE LIMIT.  Then again, I have no airbag
discount, no ABS discount, no alarm discount either - so that $800 could
theoretically be even lower.  The other cars, an Audi and a VW bring the
total policy to ~$2000/year.

If you're in NJ, try to get into NJ Manufacturer's.

George,

Just an observation about the timing belt tensioner.
I adjusted the tension on my new belt at 2000 miles and
the tensioner moved a bit to remove the slack.  I just did
another retension at 10000 miles and the tensioner didn't
move a bit. So from my sampling rate of 1, I would say that
the initial 1500-2000 mile retension is MUCH more important
than the 10000 mile. (I'm not saying the 10000m retension
wasn't important or didn't adjust the tension. This was just
a visual observation.)

Anyone know if a similar model will be offered in the US?
I doubt it will be as good as the Euro version, since it will probably 
keep the stock seats, power windows and some other stuff in order to 
comply with DOT regulations. :-(

Once the car is imported and registered, can you modify the car to Euro-spec?
Has anyone had problems with state inspections and the like after 
modifying their P-car with things such as racing-type seats, 5-point

Subject: Toyotas and the like

To settle this issue,
I'd like to add one more statement:

Toyotas, such as Corollas and Tercels, are great for basic 
transportation. They're nearly unbreakable, utterly reliable and cheap to 
operate and repair.

However, the subjective driving experience of a car as unique as the 
Porsche 911 is, IMHO, sublime and cannot be compared to any other sports car.
Granted, cars like the new Supra Turbo, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo, the Mazda 
RX-7, and especially the Nissan Skyline GT-R are all nice cars, but they 
aren't Porsches. I _like_ the idiosyncrasies of the Porsche 911- it makes 
the car unique and interesting.

Personally, I would never use a Porsche as primary transportation. Being 
that I live in an urban area, there are too many problems associated with 
commuting in a Porsche or a similar sports car. Heavy stop-and-go traffic 
make me wish for an automatic (otherwise, I hate slushboxes). The massive 
potholes of Philly will destroy low-profile-tired alloy wheels. The large 
number of unlicensed, uninsured drivers out here will increase the 
possibility of your P-car getting in an accident which you will have to 
pay for. Finally, the high cost of maintenance makes it impractical to 
drive a P-car in such harsh conditions (IMHO).

As for what other people drive, and "mall-cruising wanna-bes," I couldn't 
care less. The 80's are over, and I think we'll see less of these Porsche 
owners who only bought the car for the image.
 
Sorry for all the rambling.

Tim,

You've already answered your own question.  With only $12K and a strong
desire to avoid 'headaches of repair', the answer to your question is:

'NONE OF THE ABOVE'.

It sounds like your #1 priority is for a rugged, dependible, inexpensive
to maintain daily driver.  If it could be fun, too, that would be great.
But none of these cars fit that BASIC requirement.

If you really want to buy a toy cars right now, consider keeping your
Celica as the daily beater...its virtually worthless as a trade-in anyway,
but it will wonders to your insurance rates if you can list a toy car as
a "Pleasure Only" vehicle.  My 'beater has a 50% ROI (Return on Investment) 
just from what it saves me annually on insurance costs on the 911.  


...or maybe ~$8K on a cheap econobox and a basic 914 for ~$5K...?  :-)

Allow me to recommend a 1981 Toyota Corolla to meet that BASIC requirement.
The 3T-C engine is bullet-proof and quite ammenable to souping up a bit,
and the handling and traction improve greatly once you put on low-profile
Yokohama A-509 tires (awesome in the wet). Mine has gone 217,000 fun-filled
miles already...

And as for the budget consideration, you will have plenty of change left over
from your $12,000 limit. Like at least $10,000.

You make a good point Jay.  Actually, the older non-turbo MR2's should be very 
reliable.  The one that I drove used a Corolla drive train.  Toyota isn't 
stupid.  They took an existing drive train (the Corolla's) and married it to a 
simple, cheap to build body/chassis.  Then they sell it for lots of money.  The 
result is that most people (myself included) think it is a fun car to drive and

Something not quite right here -Helmet linings are not made to rebound - they
are crushable -that is how they protect your head, by absorbing the impact,
and that is why, once "used", they are no good and need to be relined ( at
least) or more likely thrown away.

A rebounding lining would just put the energy absorbed back into play - on

Another option, instead of replacing the sagged rear springs to start at
the factory settings, is to leave the sagged, stock rear springs in place,
and lower the front to match. This results in a lowered car, which, 
combined with decent shocks and front and rear anti-sway bars, produces
a very nice handling 914. Follow George's procedure for the actual
adjustment, but adjust the front so it is slightly lower than the rear,
as determined by the slope of the door jamb (slight downward slope to
the front). As George suggests, weight balancing is a useful addition,
once you have the basic height adjustment you want. I was initially
worried about bottoming, either on the bump stops or on the foot valve
of the shocks, but I drove the car this way for about 100K miles, with
100 or more reasonably aggressive track events along the way, without
apparent problems.

It has also been my experience that for 914's without extra chassis
stiffening across the passenger area (as would be provided by a full
cage), stiff suspensions are frequently counterproductive. A stiff
suspension on a flexible chassis just makes the chassis act like
the suspension by bending. I found that 914's with stock or near stock
spring rates were usually faster than cars with very stiff springs.
Of course, with the addition of a roll cage or other stiffening,
stiffer suspensions have more to offer.

For a street-driven but frequently tracked 914, using 206/60-15 tires on
stock (5 1/2" x 15) wheels and near stock suspension (just somewhat
lower), I found that the following was a nice compromise:

Front camber: 30 to 40' negative
Rear camber: 1 Deg. 30' to 1 Deg. 40' negative
Front toe: 0 to 1/16" total toe in, pressed
Rear toe: 1/16" toe in per side

If your emphasis is autocross, you may want some front toe-out. If
you are willing to compromise street drivability and the suspension is
still stock, even more negative camber can be used. A good rule of
thumb is to make the back camber about a degree more negative than the 
front.

This is semi Porsche related... My friend called me the other day and told me
his Chevy S-10 V6 was running really bad. Kind of like on 4 out of 6. I asked 
about the last time he tuned it, 30k ago it turns out. I have him go out and 
get the parts. So I'm at his place and I pull out one of the bosch platiniums,
Much to my suprise, The anode is melted across to the grounding electrode. No
kidding, there was a fine wire connecting across the gap! So I figure that
since it's so thin I could just knock it off, Not a chance it was welded across.
So I pull the next plug, not completely across but almost. Talk about screwing
up the gap... So I replace the plugs and the rest of the parts he got and the
truck runs like new. I`ve been working on cars for a pretty long time and
have never, never seen something like this. Anyone had a similar occurrence
with Bosch platiniums? Seems to me his truck was actually running on 5 of 6.

As I replied privately to the person who originally posted this question:
check with your local travel agent.  They can arrange rentals on anything
your heart desires (and your pocketbook allows).  The last time I checked (2
or 3 years ago, I think) while in Germany, the daily rate on a 911 was
several hundred dollars.

Renting before you arrive in Europe is cheapest.  Failing that, pay with a
credit card for the very best exchange rate (that goes for all purchases
there, by the way), and don't forget that you may have some kind of insurance
coverage included with your credit card.

Given the price of renting, I think Pete's idea of shipping your own car over
for a couple of weeks probably makes good sense (I wouldn't mine taking my
356 back to its home, either).  Anyone have any idea off-hand about current
shipping rates (container only, thank you), customs requirements,
availability of short-term insurance in Europe, etc.?

Dave:

My advice is run, do not walk, away from the project you are 
contemplating, unless you have some tremendous desire to spend lots of 
$$$$$ and lots of TTTTIIIIIIMMMMMMEEEEE on your project.  If that is the 
case, I have a project for you.

Seriously, 13 years ago I had to have a Porsche.  I was young and 
foolish, (and a poor college student) so I decided the way to get my 
dream car was to find a fixer-upper.  On one day I looked at a 1970 911T 
and a 1966 912.  I liked them both.  The 912 had one thing going for it, 
it was $1500.00 cheaper.  It also needed a lot more work.  Being young 
and etc., etc., I chose to save money today and took the 912 home.  After 
a good investment of time and $$$$ I had my P-car, a better 66 912 that 
was still somewhat a fixer-upper, that wasn't worth the $$$$$ invested.

About a year later my 912 developed a large gushing oil leak going back 
to school on a cold Wisconsin November night.  I had the car towed to my 
parents house to await the inevitable repair.  Being still young and 
foolish, I decided to rebuild the motor and do a few others odds and ends 
to complete the restoration process.  Unfortunately the time and $$$$ 
were a bit lacking and the car still sits and awaits it's restoration, 
although it is in my driveway now.  

My car is currently in better shape than you describe your proposed 
project.  I figure a minimum of $10,000, with me doing most if not all the work, to get 
back on the road with a very nice, reliable daily driver 912. I have so 
much time and $$$$ invested in my potential project right now that 
there is no turning back.  I must see it to completion.  Truth be told, I 
would probably be better of to sell what I have for parts and buy the 
best P-car I can afford than to stick more into my car.  Unfortunately, I 
have the EMOTIONAL investment in it already and that is what will drive 
me to complete the project.

I do not relate this sad tale to gain any sympathy.  It was not the only 
foolish decision I made in my life.  I love my 912 and will probably have 
it until I have drool running down my face and they stick me in a home.  
I just offer this advice on the hopes that someone else might avoid 
making the same mistake that I did.

Subject: '68 912 restore?


As the proud owner of a '66 912, and bought it as a rust bucket for $2500,
I guess I can add some perspective here.  RUN AWAY!  I wanted a '66 912
for very specific reasons - easy to work on, used to ride in one all
the time as a kid, wanted to learn how to weld.....  I've got $8k in
mine easy, and I had the engine/trans in the car (running!).  Granted,
with 3 years of my labor, I'll have a perfect car, but, if that's
not what you want, dont do it.

I've seen *many* early 912s, running and rather clean daily drivers
in the $6k+ range.  You would be *much* happier buying a running, clean
example and having fun with it right away.  The headaches and $$ associated
with getting it road-worthy will be profound unless you go into it
wanting a long-term project!  If you dont plan on doing a lot of the
work yourself, the miscellaneous parts/labor alone will kill you.  If it
really needs a floor pan, it is probably very rusty and the small misc
stuff associated with the running gear is very expensive.  
Hang in there and buy a running example for $6k and save your
remaining money for the eventual rebuilds or mechanical work.

The only other advice I can give is to find a local short-wheel base
911/912 expert and have him/her go with you and look it over for you.
Maybe (and its probably a long shot), its not that bad.

I must say that the short-wheel base 911/912s are major cool and
they are the only types of Porsche(no Toyotas in my future) I want.

Good Luck!

Subject: 912 restore ?

Hi,

        An opportunity(?) has presented itself. A local garage has a '68 912 
for sale, in a "to be restored condition". While I am looking for a long 
term project car, I have no experience with pre '74 Porsches in general and 
912's specifically. Shop is asking a $1000, here is *currently known* condition:

        Floor is supposedly rusted (have not seen extent for myself)
        no engine/trans in car
        no wheels
        rust spot on engine lid (paint bubbled up)
        rust spot on hood (paint bubbled up)
        rust spot bottom corner of windshield frame (paint bubbled up)
        suspension/steering/brakes appears all present and attached
        external body looks good (no ripples in body, no strange outlines in 
paint)
        supposedly never wrecked / no bondo on car

main reason I am giving this such a closer look is that the interior has all 
ready been redone:

        new (looking) carpet
        new leather seats
        dash top and front/face look new
        instruments complete and look refurb'd
        door panels and internal trim has been replaced / refurb'd
        has A/C hookups (this IS an issue in Houston as it would be a daily 
driver)

        I have somehow (WAG) came up with around $8k as being the number 
required to get this thing into a very good mechanical/structurally correct 
*daily driver*, not a show car. Have I been taking one of our list members' 
pills without a prescription again? About how far off is that $ number?

        Now, if the general consensus of the net gods is that this looks 
like an acceptable situation, can someone give recommendations on a (Houston 
area) shop to do the cutting/welding on at least a new floor pan? Final 
painting of the car? Source of mechanical tidbits that are 912 specific?

Andrew,

The only disadvantage of running ATE is the cost, and
even then, it's not a huge difference for what you get. IMHO.

One interesting data point to consider...
When deciding on what fluid to use in my RS America
for track events, I decided to check out what the factory
fluid is from the dealership.  They brought out a can that
was the exact same size and shape as the ATE can.  I
compared the numbers and guess what?  The dry/wet boiling
points are EXACTLY the same and are printed in the same
font, but different color.  What I've concluded is that the ATE
Blue and Porsche OEM fluids are the same stuff, only the
ATE has blue dye in it while the Porsche fluid is the standard
light amber color.

This is a very common failure mode for the new style platinum plugs
and I'm surprized the press hasn't picked it up. Seems that when the
plug overheats, the wire slips down out of the ceramic and shorts out
the plug. Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with overheating and is
just a QC problem, but they all fail the same way. If the platinum is
molded into place it would be easy to just swage it to keep it from
slipping, but it looks like it's drawn through a hole in the ceramic
after it's fired. I have a friend who works for Bosch and I'll see if
she can put me in contact with one of the spark plug guys unless someone
else already has a contact.

He heard a small whining when starting out in 1st gear but
he didn't think it was too bad. I could not find the C4 FAQ
so don't remember if these clutches are a problem and always
go bad. Is this the case? The car does not have real high mileage.

Do all the components need replacing or is it safe
to replace only the problem parts (maybe disk and throw-out
bearing are shot).

Any quick replies will be appreciated, as the car is at the Porsche

Subject: 951 Steering Racks, etc.

While replacing my front control arm last night, I decided to try
to isolate my power steering leak.  For the last two years the car
has had a slight leak.  Over this winter it has gotten progressively
worse.  I had assumed it was the pump until last night.  I checked
my tie-rods by rolling the dust boot at the rack back and a significant
amount of power steering fluid came out of each boot.  I'm assuming
that this means a new rack.  Is my diagnosis correct?  Where is a 
good place to get one?  I've seen an add in the back of Excellence 
for a company that sells rebuilt racks for $250.  This seems like 
a good price.  Unfortunately, I don't know anything about the company.
I believe the add is on page 128 of the latest Excellence, but I 
can't remember the name...  The next best price seems to be from
Vertex at about $100 more.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

What is the lists wisdom on putting in a manual rack?  Power steering 
really seems to be a waste on this small of car, in my opinion.
What all is involved in switching from power to manual steering?

Finally, my bad ball joint apparently took the tie-rod with it.
Does any one have advice on where to look for a good price on
a tie-rod?  Only the one side seems to have been affected.
Is it alright to just replace the one?

A couple of points:

It's not just the Styrofoam.  The fiberglass also drys out and 
becomes brittle.

So it takes 500 years for Styrofoam to *bio* degrade, so what?
It's completely irrelevant to the helmet discussion which is 
concerned with structural degradation.

Perhaps I missed a reply from the original poster and he may 
have addressed this, but I assumed that by used he ment worn,
not impacted.  I mean, if you were selling a helmet would you 
call it unused after wearing it all season?

I think Bell recommends using a helmet no more than 4 years

Of course I began my recommendation by saying stock springing. From my
experience, which I believe parallels the East coast consensus, you want
some additional rear roll stiffness, when working with stock front
torsion bars and a front sway bar roughly as stiff as the factory bar.
This additional rear roll stiffness could be 140# rear springs, without
any rear sway bar, or stock springs, with the factory rear anti-sway
bar. Limited slip is not an issue on unmodified 4 cylinder 914's,
in my experience. All of this is from a racetrack driving perspective,
as opposed to autocrossing, where other setups might make more sense.
I believe that it should apply for R-series DOT tires, as well as

Subject: Hole in the Wall

Folks,

I'm thinking of installing an amplifier in my goofy-looking 911.  I may have
to run a lead through the trunkwall (bootwall? firewall?), and I can't find
an opening to run the power lead through.

Any suggestions, advise, etc?

TIA

Also check that your front allignment is correct.  Uneven 
camber might cause one wheel to lock before the other.  I 
know this can happen with the rear wheels of a 911.

European Car did an article in the November 1994 issue about installed 
Hella H4s in 914s - basically just a bolt-in. (7" round, of course.) They 
come with 55/60w bulbs. German Parts and Restoration sells the 
headlights for $30 each, $8 for a 55/100w bulb.

From calling my local accessory dealer (Wilco), I found that Hella now has 
a street-legal, DOT approved version... I'm not 100% sure of the official 
name, but perhaps Hella Vision? Anyways, I'll probably be installing them 
by the weekend. (My 914 goes on the road Thursday or Friday, and one of 
the old sealed-beam non-halogens burnt out, so perfect time.)

On the thread of "which brake fluid" a sleeper out there is the Ford HD Dot
3 fluid.  I probably even got it from P-files (like everything else), but a
few of the local SCCA "shoes" are happy with it.  Cost me a bit over $5 a
pint, has a 572 deg F dry boiling point.  My only data point so far is with
back-to-back drivers in lapping sessions at Texas World Speedway (NOT a
track that is hard on brakes - with a bazillion foot long straight to cool
'em) -- stock pads, me easy on brakes & Sally a long/soft braker (read *hot*
parts).

We had firm brakes all day in the Carrera...

I've used Motul in the past and like it, but don't like it relative to cost
and amount of fluid changing it requires to keep dry...

Speaking as a Porsche dealership parts guy, you can order cut keys directly 
from Germany with just your VIN code. I'm not 100% sure if a locksmith can 
make them as well, some keys are laser-cut and cannot be copied by 
locksmiths. Plus the fact that copies rarely work as well - I had a very 
reputable lockshop copy my 914 key, and it only works in one direction. (Ie, 
it's cut on both sides, but not both sides work correctly.)

Mercedes-Benz and BMW keys are this way, as are some other high-line cars. 
In fact, the newest BMW 7-series and the new Land Rover SE has electronics 
in the key that "talk" to the car every time you start the car, and have a 
special code that changes every time you start the car... All in the name of 
reducing car-thefts. What this means is potentially long waits for a duplicate 
key (depending upon manufacturer), and big-time expensive (to the tune of 
over $100 per key.)

Anyways, summation: Go to your dealer, and order a key. (They don't need 
your key at all, just your VIN.) It'll be more than the $3 or whatever a 
lockshop charges, but it'll be right, and you'll be able to sleep at night. :)

An alternative to Bosch or Hella H-4's are Cibie's Z-Beams - these are
truly fantastic headlights, and have a convex face (not flat like H4's).  I
use them on my 914 and on an Alfa.  I find their pattern to be outstanding,
and IMHO they look more appropriate on older cars. They are tough to find -
I used to buy mine from AutoMod in Atlanta.

Joe asks when do you know if the idler pulleys are bad on a 944;

Joe,
Porsche says the idler pulley bearings are bad if you can hear them when the
car is running. That's pretty subjective. The method I used when I changed
mine was to "feel"  them carefully. If they are rough when rotating or have
side to side play they get replaced. Several shops that I have asked have
said that the bearings are the most neglected area of the Porsche Cam Belt
conundrum. One shop accused the pulley as being the leading cause of belt
failure, the rational being that a bad bearing allows the belt to twist. 
Maybe someone can give you a more definitive answer. It just seems that while
you are doing the project you might as well take care of that variable.
I got my parts from Porsche BTW

Having raced MR-2s (and running the MR-2 digest, but that hardly makes
me an expert), as well as my P-car involvement, it might be time to
speak up here now that we've gone back to real content instead of
marque-centric flaming.

The MR-2 is a jumbo pain in the ass to work on. The good news is you 
don't need to do it very often when it's new. It's a great car to own
for the first 5-6 years. After, well... ever wonder why they Mk I
cars are so cheap? Thought not, but it might be time to start...

The 911 on the other hand is only *ocassionally* a jumbo pain in the ass
to work on, like when you're trying to reach a forearm that's 15 inches
around into a hole that's only 4 inches across... If you don't do *ANY*
of the work yourself, here's what you're looking at:

annual "major service" -- adjust valves, check CIS, change plugs, etc etc
is about $600-700, depending on where you get it done.

oil change, every 3000 miles or 3 months (so you need 3 of these plus the
major service) is about $85-120, depending on where you have it done and
if they use synthetic oil or not.

tires -- you'll eat a set of *good* tires (AVS Intermediates or similar)
every 12-14 months in the back at about $170 a tire. You'll need to
replace the fronts every other set of rears.

You *may* need valves and guides in the 100-150k mile range, depending on
whether or not the car has been well cared for, how lucky you are, etc.
The bottom end typically goes well over 200k, and 300k has been seen.
On the other hand, one typically gets "shipwright's disease" when doing the 
valves and says "well, as long as I'm already in there..." and then you
split the case and that's that...

Of course, you get into "stuff that should have been done before" like you may 
need shocks or a clutch or something. And "stuff that breaks" like
clutch cables, etc. And that's it.

Oh, and certainly, "improvements".... 8{)

Over five years, my 911 cost me *LESS* per year than my previous 3 street
cars (Volvo, Audi, Mercury). Once you factor out the "improvements" that
is...

I'm not aware of Ferry designing furniture, and Ferdinand-designed

But, there are two other more likely explainations:

Kathleen,

Here's a copy of an old message from Stan with some suggestions about
shoulder belts.  I checked out the two suppliers he mentioned and came
to the same conclusions.  I got the shoulder belts from Carquip, and
I'm very happy with them.  The only downside is that they are not
automatically adjusting which can be a little awkward at times,
especially for passengers who aren't used to them, but the retractable
shoulder belts from P.E. Products require you to drill holes into the
posts behind your doors.  I didn't want to modify my 912 that way.

Oh, one small complication with the Carquip shoulder belts.  On 912s
and older 911s, the shoulder belt requires a standoff at the point
where the shoulder belt bolts to the chassis (see the 911/912 parts
catalog drawing; I can get the part number for you if you want).  The
standoff is apparently not required on 356s, so Carquip didn't include
them in the shipment originally, but they were quick to send me the
standoffs as soon as I gave them a call (they have a bunch of
dismantled cars from which they were able to pull the parts).  I was
very pleased with their service.

with spacers on the track.  How about the bolt-on spacers that use regular
length studs.  I am interested in the strength of the actual wheel mounting.
 I am aware of the additional bearing loading factors.  I bring this up
because I am beginning to see alot of more of this on track driven cars and I
feel that there could be a potential problem.  Thanks in advance for the
responses.

I just picked up my gauge and have some questions about it:

1. Is it supposed to come with instructions? Mine came in a small brown 
   Porsche labelled box wrapped in a really wrinkled clear plastic bag.
 
2. I also have the calibrator.(721 920 12). How do you calibrate the gauge?
 
3. When viewing the dial straight on and setting '0' to top, the needle
   sits at 0.6 units and is not at vertical. Is this normal?

Sorry. Turbo Cup cars came with Bilsteins.  Escort cars came with double
adjustable Konis.  How do I know?  We own an '87 Escort car!  
Why the difference?  Turbo Cup cars raced against other Turbo Cup cars, so
adjustables weren't needed.  Escort cars raced agasint Corvettes.  The
Corvettes had different Bilsteins for every track, along with other goodies.

make a lot of difference in the big picture.  You don't have to
keep the licensed and insured all the time.

It's spring now .. and shortly my 356 will venture out.  Maybe this

Subject: Renting in Europe

A few years ago I took my family to England and Ireland for a few
weeks.  I looked into rental, but it was steep, so I went another
route.  I arrived in England Sunday morning, early.  By Sunday night
I had been through a set of local want ads and picked out a few potential
cars (remember they only need to last a couple of weeks).  Monday I
purchased a 68 Rover 2000 .. my first car with leather seats and my
only one with a deDion rear axle.  The cost was 150 pounds (a week's
rental for that size car).

Fortunately my insurance agent had an office in London, so I stopped
there for insurance and went to the Post Office for plates on Tuesday...
along with sight seeing.  DONE !!!  I drove the car five weeks with
10 pounds to patch two flat tires and balance the wheels.  That
plus gas and oil were the total cost.

I gave the car to my sister-in-law when I left.  She drove it for
six months (until it needed an new MOT inspection) and then sold
it for 100 pounds.  The insurance for a couple of weeks was trivial.

No it wasn't a Porsche, but it was a fun car and one I'm glad to
have owned.

Hi all, sorry to add to this idiotic thread, but I have firsthand
knowledge in this area.

Last Weekend I drove a '93 MR-2 Turbo at the San Diego
Pro Solo. I have driven my '72 911S for ten years.


MR-2 Turbo vs Porsche 911 : The '93 MR-2 is very neutral and
	nimble. The ABS brakes are awesome! The 911 would have had several
	flat-spots on the front tires after the SD pro solo, and several 
	cones when I would have plowed under braking when I came in to the
	offsets too hot. But the MR-2 just pulsed a bit and turned in!
	The MR-2 is very kind to tires - our 226s wore perfectly evenly.

	   Of course the MR-2 shifter is a big advantage over the 911,
	which you don't PUT in gear but kindly RECOMMEND a gear.

	   The MR-2 comes off the line pretty good if you slip the clutch.
	But if you bog the engine, you lose big time.
	The turbo power is hard to deal with for me - it pulls weakly 
	when you nail it, then sneaks up on you. Never kicks you in the back
	like a 911, and no "on the cam" feel when the revs climb.

	   The MR-2 does not take a cornering set and dig in like the 911 - 
	it drifts a bit which I am not used to. Will be a good battle in
	A-Stock along with the new M3!


Anyway, all this is irrelevant as a few have pointed out - if
you have to ask if you should buy a Porsche then the answer is NO!
If you want to enjoy a relationship with a unique car that you
will always remember, get a 911. If not...

David,

I think you should consider the car you described as a 'parts' car. You can
find a reasonably good early 912 that would suffice as a driver in the $4,000
 - 7,000 range that won't need restoration if you spend some time looking.

We're doing a Project 912 at Porsche Market Letter that will end up as a
PCA/POC/Vintage Racer.  It had serious rust in the floor and front pan which
we have fixed with parts and labor by project sponsors.  But, this project
has once again proven to me that if you have to pay for major rust repair in
an early 911/912, most cars are too expensive even if they are given to you
free(they're still great parts cars though!).  There are exceptions of
course, but not 68 912 Coupes.

Andrew,  I think the only problem with racing brake fluids id that they are
more hydrophilic than normal.  If you don't change your fluid frequently, you
risk possible H2O damage to your brake's internal components( I think that
means expensive).  I'm not sure how frequent is neccessary.  I'm flushing
every 100-150 track miles in the front of my early S and it needs it.  Every
other for the backs.  Any other ideas from racers out there?

If you really can't find a suitable existing hole and have to cut a new

Oh, by the way... Make sure your wires are heavy enough to carry the

Subject: "Race" Brake Fluid

Someone asked about the wisdom of using "race" brake fluid in a street 
car.

The only thing to watch out for (besides the price of some of the 
fluids) is that a lot of the race fluids have very high DRY boiling 
points, but low WET boiling points.  This matters not to racers who 
change their fluid frequently, but it's a definite concern for the 
average street-car driver.

Of course, if you're only driving on the street, you may not need a 
really high-boiling-point fluid anyway.

Larry:

Since 911 Turbos came from the factory with spacers and longer studs (at 
least, before the current Carrera-2 variations -- I don't know what the 
factory does to position the new more-positive offset wheels), I'd 
expect the combination to be perfectly safe.

The bolt-on spacers may be less safe... I don't know.  I do know that 4- 
to 5-lug adapters (like those used for mounting 5-spoke alloys on 
otherwise-stock 914-4s) are universally banned from competition, even 
for relatively light-duty use in PCA autocrosses.

 -Andy

P.S.  If you're using spacers on the front wheels, you may also want to
      keep in mind the effect they'll have on your steering offset.

Err, Pete my old son, you're too late.. TA regulations currently existing in
numerous european countries will shortly become the EU standard which basically
means that *anything* that you fit to your car (wheels, seats etc) must be
TA'd for that application. Whilst it's not, perhaps, going to be a problem for 
most manufacurers of seats etc. to TA their products it will probably mean that
you can't just swap and change as you wish. Up 'til now the UK goverment has obtained
numerous exemptions from EU TA regs for the british market but how long they will
continue to do this (basically to protect UK manufacturers and small businesses)
is doubtfull and the EU will stop them at some point. Most folks in the UK (or EU!)
have *very* little idea of the amount of legislation hitting the EU about TA
(for everything) - motorcyclists have been the first hit 100PS limit story) - which
is small stuff compared to the effects of the coming multi-directive on noise,
emissions & TA. Bastards

I used to be very much in favour of the EU (after all, I live abroad..) but after
having seen the effect Swiss TA regs (and the strictness with which their applied
 - boring bunch of farts!) I would just hate for everybody else to get their rules
(which is basically what's happening) but it's going to happen whether I (or you) 
like it or not...

a far better way is put an ad in the UK PCBG or 911 mag saying something like

Congratulations on purchasing the gauge.

The directions on how to use it are in the Porsche Factory 944 Manual. That 
includes the directions on how to calibrate.

The cheapest form of the factory service manual is $26 and change from

Yep, you need a rack. 

There are lots of rack rebuilders. Some just repaint them and call them
rebuilt. There is one that actually rebuilds them for PCNA, but he charges

Don't put in a manual rack:

1) They were only available prior to 1984 and you are now looking at an 11
year-old rack in a much more capable car...

2) The manual rack is not as strong as the power rack, at least that's what
I have been told.

3) The manual rack has a slower steering ratio than the power rack.

If you really want, and your spouse doesn't object, and you don't do much
parallel parking, what you can do is remove the power steering pump,
reservoir, and cooling hose, and run the return hose back into the pressure
hose, right at the steering rack itself. 

Since the system is no longer under pressure, you will lose no more fluid.
And you regain the power that the pump was using. And you keep the same
quicker steering.

What you give up is the power assist at low speeds. Save the parts, and if
you don't like the fix, you can retrofit to original later...

Of course, this modification is permitted on cars that are not driven on the
highway, blather, blather, blather... :-)

   This is a very common failure mode for the new style platinum plugs
   and I'm surprized the press hasn't picked it up. Seems that when the
   plug overheats, the wire slips down out of the ceramic and shorts out
   the plug. Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with overheating and is
   just a QC problem, but they all fail the same way. If the platinum is
   molded into place it would be easy to just swage it to keep it from
   slipping, but it looks like it's drawn through a hole in the ceramic

Real Platinums????
I'm confused/concerned.
The "only" Platinums I've seen are the "ceramic covered" ones.  Do the real 
ones look like the normal copper one's?  I've seemed to have no trouble with 
these platinums over the past several years since they came out.  I've 
usually bought them at some time of Nationwise/NAPA type auto store.  Have I 
been swindled all this time???  I've never heard of two types of Platinums. 
 Not even from mechanic types.  What's up?  Are they still better than the 
normal copper plugs?  Where do I get real ones and/or silver tipped ones.
What about the three-electrode plugs???

   No, these are the same ones you would get anywhere, but since
   K-Mart started pushing them a few years back, I couldn't resist
   calling them that.

   These plugs are easy to tell because they have the ceramic covered center
   electrode and are the only affordable Bosch platinums.
   I'm no Robert Bosch, but I think they are obviously bad, as the
   spark is squooshed inside a small area, and they don't work
   in many applications (foulm turn black, etc).

   The "REAL" Bosch platinums are about $15 each, and specified
   for the 911S and Turbos. But I've been happy with the Silver so far
   (but never ran on a real race track yet).

Dear Rick,

Loosening CV joints is a common occurance unless we adhere to the following:
1. Make sure CV joints are not too worn and packed full of grease. A dry or
worn CV will actually run "unbalanced" and loosen the bolts.
2. Install CV joint gaskets between the CV and output flange or stub axle.
3. Properly install two roll pins, 2 half moon locking plates, four 8x46 CV
joint bolts and four seradded cone washers torquing the bolts to 31 ft.lbs.
4. Periodically check the bolts for tightness (every 10,000 miles).

If you do the above, the joints will not loosen!

Dear Dave,

It sounds like its time to print the Dr.914 valve adjustment procedure! Good
luck!

PROPER VALVE ADJUSTMENT

Proper valve adjustment is critical to proper engine operation. Since the 914
engine is air cooled, it operates in a much broader temperature range than a
water cooled car, resulting in more extreme expansion and contraction. This
movement necessitates periodic valve adjustment.

Tools required are as follows:

1. Feeler gauge of at least 8" in length to access the adjuster

2. Pry bar screwdriver to unlatch the valve cover bales and turn the front
fan

3. Spark plug wrench

4. Tire tool, jack, jackstands

5. Crate, milk carton, or small step ladder to stand on

6. 13 mm box wrench to loosen locking nut valve adjuster

7. Short wide-bladed screwdriver to turn the adjusting lugs

8. A small piece of cardboard with a 90 degree edge

9. Stick of bright white touch-up paint

10. 2 valve cover gaskets

11. Can of Brake Clean

12. Several valve adjusting lugs

We begin by removing the spark plugs, the timing hole plug and unclipping the
distributor cap. With the spark plugs removed, one should be able to turn the
fan by hand, although the pry bar can assist through the timing hole. Make
sure you pry against the rear of the fan blades as the front of the blades
are unattached and will easily shear. (You may notice that some of the blades
are already missing from past mistakes! If more than three in a row are
missing, you must replace the fan.) Turn the fan until you notice the "0"
mark show through the timing hole (on 1.8 liter engines this is the red 7
degree mark and on 1.7, 2.0 it is either stamped "0" or a white mark. Do not
mistake the "0" mark for the (1.7, 2.0) 27 degree BTDC (Before top dead
center) mark which is located just to the right passenger side of one of four
big, thick fan blades.) Lift the distributor cap and observe the distributor
rotor. The firing portion should face towards the number one spark plug wire
tower. If your distributor is installed properly, the rotor will be in the 10
o'clock position (considering the front of the car is 12 o'clock). If the
rotor is facing 180 degrees opposite, turn the fan again until the "0" degree
mark shows and the rotor will now be pointing towards the number one spark
plug tower. We are now ready to adjust the valves on the number one spark
plug tower. We are now ready to adjust the valves on the number one cylinder
(the driver's side rear cylinder).

Loosen the wheel nuts and jack the car (under the engine mounting bar) to a
height where, in a sitting position, the fender well clears your head. Place
jackstands under the jacking donuts and make sure the car rests solidly. It
is wise to leave the jack under the car - just in case. Remove the left valve
cover by wedging the bale from the cover. Valve adjustment access is tight,
so it takes practice to perfect the technique.

Since we have already set up to adjust cylinder number one, we can adjust
those valves (both intake and exhaust) immediately. Slide the feeler gauge in
between the adjusting lug and the top of the valve "feeling" the gap. Valves
in perfect adjustment nip the gauge snugly; valves too loose let the tool
sloppily slide in. Valves too tight will not let the gauge pass. To adjust,
loosen the 13 mm locking nut with the box wrench and turn the lug with the
short screwdriver. It is a good idea at this time to inspect the valve
adjusting lugs for damage by completely unscrewing the lug from the rocker
arm. (1973 2.0 valve adjusting lugs will not unscrew without removing the
rocker arm assemblies, so don't try it!) Slight wear on the bottom of the lug
is common, however, if the lug looks pock-marked, it needs replacement.
Adjusting lugs worn in this manner will cause premature valve stem wearout
and a noisy power train! Adjust both intake and exhaust valves of the number
one cylinder, then snug the locking nuts. Specifications for adjustment are
as follows:


1970-75 1.7 and 1.8 .006 inches

1973-76 2.0 .006 intake/.008 exhaust


The intake valves are always the two in the middle of the rocker arm assembly
and exhaust valves are the outboard two. We are now ready to adjust the
number four or the passenger side front cylinder.

Standing on our milk carton (unless you are 6'8"), we recheck the timing mark
to make sure it has not moved and then hold our 90 degree angled cardboard on
top of the rotor, rotating the fan until the rotor moves 90 degrees
clockwise. (The firing point of the rotor will move from being in line with
one side of the cardboard to being in line with the other side.) The reason
we do this is to align the exact firing point for the number four cylinder.
(The engine fires each of the 90 degrees as the distributor rotates clockwise
1, 4, 3, 2.) When we have established that the rotor has moved exactly 90
degrees, we then look down at the fan through the timing hole and use our
white touch-up to mark the fan in the "V" observation notch. This mark now
gives us a reference point for the firing of the number 4 and the number 2
cylinders. (Remember the "0" for (1.7, 2.0) or the red mark (1.8) are still
the firing points for number 1 and 3 cylinders.) We now adjust the number
four. or the passenger side cylinder, in the manner previously described.

After adjusting the number four cylinder, we again go to the top of the
engine and turn the fan. This causes the rotor to move clockwise another 90
degrees to the firing point of the number three cylinder. There is no need to
use the cardboard as when we achieve the 90 degree clockwise turn, the white
(or red 1.8) timing mark will again show! We then adjust the number three, or
the passenger side rear cylinder again by the method previously described.
Our final valve to adjust is of course number two, or the driver's side front
cylinder.

When we turn the fan and watch the rotor move clockwise its final 90 degrees,
we will see our painted mark show when the 90 degrees is achieved. We finally
adjust number two in the manner previously described and then recheck the
valve adjusting nut tightness on all cylinders.

Installing the valve covers is next. If you want to avoid leaks, please read
thoroughly! Carefully check the valve cover gasket mounting surfaces for
leftover gasket material, glue or other debris. Clean the entire cover with
Brake Clean or mineral spirits and dry thoroughly. Place the valve cover
gasket into the cover, pushing it into the two holders and stretching the
shape so it sits perfectly in the cover. If the gasket is kinked or crooked,
you may use a slight dot of black weather-strip adhesive to hold the gasket's
shape in the cover. Do not use gasket cement or glue - it makes a mess, could
fall into the engine and could make it difficult to remove the covers when
valve adjustment is next due.

Place the valve cover against the cylinder head squarely holding it tightly
down and wedge the bale over the cover with the pry bar. If you don't hold
the cover tightly while wedging the bale , it will cockeye and you will have
to begin the whole process again.

When you are sure the valve covers are properly seated, climb back to the top
of the engine, clip on the distributor cap, install the spark plugs, screw in
the timing hole plug and then start the engine. It is important here to let
the engine run for five minutes to check for leaks and excessive valve train
noise. Leaks are caused by cockeyed valve covers and noise:  a mis-adjusted
valve.

If everything checks out, install the wheels and tires and snug the lug
bolts. Jack the car up, remove the jackstands and let the car down. Torque
the lug bolts to 90 foot pounds.

Congratulations!! You have now completed a proper 914 valve adjust and have
helped assure long engine life and optimum performance!

Fred,

I mounted an amplifier under the passenger seat of my '87 911.  I routed the
power cables along side of the fender and up over the ducting to the passenger
side of the car.  Up above the passenger foot well there are two holes with
cables and rubber boots.  These are big enough to stretch and squeeze the
power cables thru also.  I think I used 6-8 guage copper.  Can't really
remember, but it seemed pretty thick.

Also, if you mount under the passenger seat, there are a couple threaded nuts
welded on the floor pan already.  I think they are for mounting the motronic
on English versions.  Anyway, except for the door holes for the speaker
components, my system went in with zero cutting/drilling.  I figure I can get
new door panels if I want to restore to original.

I'll check again what I did in case I need to update this posting.

Oil coolers on cars earlier than 87 seem to last a long time. It was only in
1987 when Porsche updated the design that they started to have problems.

My 74 914-2 had a notch in the flywheel which aligned with the case
center (viewed from the bottom of the car) when the engine was TDC on
#2 and #4. This may be both easier and more accurate than the 90 Deg.
cardboard trick. Of course you don't need perfect TDC accuracy for this
job. I ended up putting a paint mark on the pulley for #2 and #4 TDC,
as you did, except using the bottom mark for a reference. I also put
a mark on the flywheel (I used a few center punch marks in a row)
corresponding to #1 and #3 TDC, so I could find everything from either
the top or the bottom, without going back and forth. You can put the car
in 5th gear, and lock the emergency brake on one side, then just turn
the other rear wheel to move from one cylinder to the next, all from
the bottom. I don't know if the whole 914 model line had this flywheel
notch for #2 and #4, or if I was just lucky. I seem to remember a reference
in the 914 shop manual mentioning the notch, but it has been a while.

Be especially careful of the top of the gasket. The car won't leak on 
the garage floor, but will leak like crazy under hard cornering, when
a lot of oil accumulates in the cover. Don't ask me how I know this.
Just note that there still aren't many miscuitos -uh- muisquitos oh,
hell, bugs- around the left-hander at Lime Rock. I ended up using RTV,
just between the cover and the gasket, to be sure everything stayed
in place, but still allowing easy removal of the cover and gasket
next time. RTV is reasonably easy to remove from the cover, once you
pull off the gasket. Don't use very much. You don't want any "extra"
to cause a problem.

very practical for a family--lots of trunk space--good performance for a
family car. I think your whole problem can be summed up in the phrase
"Compared to What?".

Ouch!  That's bad news.  I guess I must be naive assuming that most
people consider a rebuild the same thing I do.  I would certainly 
pay the extra bucks for a good versus marginal unit.  I know 
several people on the list have replaced steering racks before.
What are your experiences with different rebuilt units?

Not cheap, just ignorant in this case.  I don't know what all has to be
done in this case.  I don't want to throw money and time away at a 
non-existent problem, but I don't mind spending it if it's justified.

Should I have replaced the other ball joint?  I only did the one.

The "REAL" plugs that Mike refers to are the "DPO" series.  The 
electrode is on the side, not over top, of the tip.  They're good plugs, 
ungodly expensive, but last much longer than the cheaper ones.  I've 
used W5DPOs in my '72 911T for the last few years and swear by them.  I 
pulled a set out after 18 months last weekend and they were still in 
pretty good shape.  The plugs actually last longer than a set of points 
in my car.

The bset bet is the Audi RS2..basically an Audi 80 estate that

will carry the wife, kids, dogs and shopping at 150mph!! Also looks
pretty standard so its great for scaring 911 owners, the only giveaway
is if you look through the wheels. Huge brake calipers with PORSCHE
in bright red is a bit of a clue as to whats underneath. Price in the

Paul can't speak for US experience, but from UK experience, I couldn't 
buy a half decent 911 for the going 944 price - generally 911 
availability at < 10k uk pounds are older machines many pre-galvanising, 
if they have ever seen a uk winter, they are probably well rusted - I 
guess Stanford area is similar

For the same money you get a 944 with lower mileage galv'ed body and 
?low? maint costs.

OK you don't get the qudos of 911 ownership - but what the hell I'm happy

control.  Once the boost is up, whee!  A fine car to show up at the ski

the Renault F1 minivan has potential...)

Well...

You could put one of the little ones up for adoption.  Ok, ok, never mind.

How about a second car?

Keep the 930 and buy an early '80's volvo wagon (or similar beast).

I used to have a '78 subaru wagon in addition to the 911 (now I have 
a mazda pickup in addtion to the 911).  Increase in insurance is 
negligable ($300/yr tops) and you could find something reliable for
$1500-$3000.

Hi there,

Most recent is always best for any Porsche.  (Porsche makes running changes, not
waiting for new model year like most).

WRT 944 vs 911 for same cost: Main consideration is which do *you* prefer?
Another, no inconsequential factor to consider is that *very* few cars made 
retain their value as well as the 911, so you might, say for $17.5K, get a 6 
year old 951 (944 turbo), or a 14 year old 911 (SC).  The 951 will out perform
the SC, except in the retained-value arena.  the longer you keep the cars,
the greater the 911s advantage over the 944 (or any wter pumper, even the 928s,
which cost a *Lot* more than the 911 when both were new).

While you can't ignore (OK, You may, but I sure as hell can't) financial 
considerations, beyond determining whether you can *afford* to *own* a 
Porsche, the model you choose should be the one that floats *your* boat!

Ed,

What makes you think that a 20 year old 911 can't out handle a
2 year old MR-2?

The basic suspension of a '72 911S is the same as a '89 Carrera.
Without major modification, a '72 911S can be made to handle
better than a '94 Carrera 2.

Sure, a stock '72 911S with stock wheels and tires cannot compete
with today's sports cars. But I can guarantee that Mike's '72 911S
is better than stock.

I tend to agree with the general conclusion of not doing anything,
but weren' there oil cooler problems on earlier 944's as well? I seem to
remember technical bulletins on shims under the seals, and an upgraded
cooler housing for the early (pre 87) cars. In 87 they incorporated
all of the fixes, and then screwed up on the O-rings themselves, many
of which needed to be replaced (including mine). Perhaps the problems on
the early cars were frequent enough to require a TB, but not so frequent
that most cars had them (my impression is that a relatively large fraction
of the 87 cars have the seal problem, at some point).

You will probably get a lot of responses, here is my $.02.

I currently have an 86 944, I think it is a great car. Things you should know
about 944s in general:

The model came out in 1983. There was a major update done halfway through the
model year in 1985. You will see some cars advertised as 85.5s, those cars
are the same as 86 and 87. Some of the improvements are to the suspension,
and electrical system. If you can afford it, I suggest you restrict your
search to the 85.5 or newer cars. These are currently in the range of $7000
and up (here on the east coast) for a good condition, normally aspirated 944.
In 1986 a Turbocharged car was offered. The turbo has 217 HP (as opposed to
150 for normally aspirated 944), bigger brakes, and stiffer shocks. In 1987 a
16 valve 944 was offered, the 944S. The 944 S was sold in 1987 and 1988 and
had 188HP. In 1988 the displacement of the standard 944 was increased from
2.5 to 2.7 litres. Also in 1988 a special version of the turbo was sold, the
Turbo S model. The Turbo S was rare, only about 400 were produced. The TurboS
has 247HP, bigger brakes, and an even stiffer suspension. In 1988 there were
5 different 944s, the standard 944, 944S, 944 Turbo and 944 TurboS, and the
924s (924 bodywork and suspension, 944 powertrain). ABS and dual airbags
became standard in 1988 (some say 1987). In 1989 the number of 944s dropped
to three, standard 944, 944 Turbo (same as 88 Turbo S), and 944 S2, with a
3.0 litre 16 valve engine (210 HP). In 1990, there were just two cars, 944S2
coupe, and 944S2 cabriolet. 1991 was the last year for 944, the 968 was sold
in 1992. The most desirable 944 is the 88 TurboS or 89 Turbo. Prices for
these cars are in the 18-22K range.

In order to give advice on which model to purchase requires more information.
What do you intend to do with the car? Drive it on weekends, daily, on the
track? Who is going to perform the maintenance, you, local mechanic, dealer,
porsche specialist? What is your budget?

I prefer the 944 over the 911, but I don't have that much 911 experience. The
944 is much cheaper, but the 911 will hold it's value much better. Unless you
are talking about an OLD 911, the only comparably priced 944 would be a newer
S2, or TurboS. This would probably compare to an mint condition 911SC, or an
84+ Carerra. The 944 would have ABS and dual airbags, the 911 would not. The
944 would have the same or more HP, and better balance. But it is not a 911,
which has appeal to a large number of people. When people think of Porsche,
they think 911, not 944.

If you answer some of the other questions, I can give you more advice.

Hi, Frank

I have never heard the owner of an 1983-1986 944 owner complain about his
personal experience of failure of an oil cooler. Anybody out there have an
evidence to the contrary?

BTW, I routinely dismantle 944 motors with no indication of failure or
replacement (mileages up to 200K).

Of course, my limited experience is only one datapoint.

I saw it as well. Quite pretty car, and the ad isn't obvious at first who it's for. The 
thing that REALLY got my attention was that it was plainly shown that it was

I thought the Diablo was only rated at 375HP or so, and the new 993 Turbo at
405HP.  I also wouldn't be surprised to find out that the 993 is much lighter

Kevin, I'm going to go against the tide (and probably regret it later). 
Making a few assumptions, my suggestion would be an older BMW 535is. You get 
the room and a RWD car that's enjoyable to drive without spending a lot more 
than the value of your 930.

Assumptions (that no one to this point has considered)
 - your 1980 930 and a small note won't complete a newer Audi, BMW, etc... 
purchase
 - you may not have the room to keep the 930
 - you are selling the 930 for the money for the next car

these would be _all_ valid reasons for me if my girlfriend forced me to

Did anyone so the Yellow sequentially "Turbo-ed" 911 in this month's 
issue of European Car Magazine. I think it was also featured in Turbo 
magazine.

Anyway, I think it was rated at 730hp (If I remember correctly) that 
would surely blow the doors (big as they are) off of the Diablo.

Strictly speaking, non-stock, of course.


Correct me if my numbers are wrong.

Hi, Peter.
 
I've worked in Germany for 5 years. I shipped 3 cars from there to here, one
by air (went in the back of the 747 I was riding, picked up from U.S.
Customs the next day) and 2 by container. I have never had a problem, I know
how it works, and it's not that difficult. Trond can tell you the same thing.
And you know about rental costs over there. I would leave the car with
friends for a year or two, so I have wheels whenever I fly over. I have lots
of mileage points to burn off in the next couple of years.
 
If nothing else, my second-owner C coupe would absolutely walk away with the
local concours awards in Germany, judging by the patched-up trash I've seen
posing as "Kalifornien-kar" over there. We have a higher standard of
originality over here, and better basis material.

If you are in Europe, Japan, or several other places, there are some very 
interesting alternatives to a Porsche 930. :-)

How about an Audi Avant RS2? Porsche-built, Porsche alloys, and 315 hp 
out of a 20v inline-5. It will hold five and their luggage as well.

Or a BMW M5 Touring. 340 hp BMW 5-series wagon with the suspension from 
the M5 sedan, I believe.

In the US:

Volvo 850 Turbo Sportwagon- 222 hp from a 20v turbo inline-5, and a 
5-speed manual option (I think, not sure of this).

BMW 530i Touring (I don't know if you can get this with a 5-speed)

And if you can go with a sedan:
Leftover BMW M5
Leftover Mercedes E500
BMW 540i 6-speed
Audi S6
AMG C36
BMW M3

And finally, as someone else has said, you can always just get a decent
used station wagon or minivan for the kids and keep the 930.

Sounds really neat. Which channel?

BTW, it's unrealistic to show a Porsche passing a motorcycle, at least 
not something like a Suzuki GSX-R1100 or a Kawasaki ZX-11. Now if it was

Like Mike Piera, I found my early 911 motor was finicky about plugs ('72E).
 I did some stop watch testing a few years back and actually found a
difference (slight) between a few that I tried.  The ones I tried then were
:

NGK Gold Palladium (whatever...)
NGK Std.
Bosch Copper
Bosch Platinum
ND U-Groove (absolutely were horrible!!)

This also happens to be the order of how I like them.  The most notable
difference was between the NGK Golds and *any* of the others.  These plugs
are about $5 each nowadays.  You could feel a difference mostly in the lower
rpm range between the NGK Gold and the others (except ND) -- the ND's would
barely even run...  BTW,  I have had super bad luck with Champions on just
about anything I've tried to run them in with cracking insulators to just
crappy firing.  Oh, and since we're on the plug topic; I was one that took
advantage of the 30 day money back guarantee on the Splitfires, they ran
marginally better than NDs.

IMHO, I would run the NGK Golds in any fuel happy application (carbs or
inefficient F.I.) they seem to self-clean much better than others I've
tried.  The Carrera seems to be happy with the K-Mart Bosch Platinum's, but
I'll replace them as soon as my NGK order comes in....  Oh and the tow and
commute slugs get about anything that's on sale -- Autolite, A/C, etc... --
they seem to be happy that I even look under their hoods!!  :-)

As always, YMMV!!

Must you??  I still remember with great regret getting rid of a Sunbeam Tiger
to buy a VW bug because my daughter was growing up.  And that was a long time
ago!  I can well imagine how I would have felt had the car been a 356
Carrera, instead of the Tiger.

I always felt that I should have found a way to store the sports car and
bought a practical daily driver.  

Keep the 930, even if you have to beg, steal or borrow.  (Well, forget the
"steal" part.)  Regret is a terrible thing, my friend!

Subject: Exhibit Number 1/ Oil Cooler Failure 

     George,
     
     Mine went last summer to my suprise. At the risk of sounding really 
     stupid to you all, because I didn't know, heres what happen. I was 
     getting that brown milky substance in my antifreeze. I thought at 
     first that I must have a leak in my head gasket. Only problem is when 
     you have a leak in your head gasket you get the muck in your oil not 
     in your anti freeze. Plus the car will usually over heat quickly. 
     I took it to my normal Euro-mechanic. He said it was odd but it must 
     be a head gasket also. So I made an appointment to get the engine 
     basically rebuilt. Figuring if their that far into the engine I might 
     as well get it all done. 
     While casually talking to mom that day I told her about the problem 
     and her wise words were, Call an authorized Porsche dealer. Let me 
     explain, here in Iowa there is one P-Car dealer and he's a hundred 
     miles away. She said,"If it don't seem right it probably isn't." This 
     coming from a woman that thinks my 944 is cute but doesn't see any 
     difference between it and my sisters Honda Prelude.
     She was right! Without any hesitation he told me that it was the 
     cooler and that they have to fix these all of the time. 
     The good thing was it was only $300. The bad thing was I lost a good 
     mechanic because I wont go back there again. They would have changed 
     the head gasket and I still would have had the problem.
     Sorry to go so long about this but maybe it will save someone else 
     some greef.
     I have been reading lately about the recalls on these and have been 
     wondering if mine was part of the recall.

Yes. What this does is keep the full battery power from getting to the fuel
injectors and the engine will stop running. You will have the power to run
the radio and some gauges and the like, but not enough to run the injectors.
This same problem happens on our '85 Buick all the time. The radio and such
will work, but the thing loosens up enough to keep the car from starting up.

Oh, for the experiment, all that should happen is that your engine should
just go 'click' and die. No fuel = no go. But why do this and lose all your
radio stations and such? :)

Disconnecting the battery and running a car without injectors does no harm
(to my knowledge) which is why you can still push/pull-start a car without
injectors.

Since your car has entered this 'golden' age, it would be wise to carry the
box end wrench that fits your battery so that you can promptly leap out of
the car and tighten it. (This was our $1.99 Kmart solution for the Buick)

The Mityvac is a suction system that you attach at the caliper bleeding nipple.
Its major drawback, from what I understand, is that it can suck air in 
from around
the bleed nipple's threads so that you never really know when the air is out of
the system.

The Eezibleed pressurizes the master cylinder fluid resevoir so that fluid is
forced out of the bleed nipple when you open it. The Eezibleed must be
connected to a source of moderatly pressurized air, such as a spare tire or,
if you have a collapsing/compact spare, a 12v air pump.

I made a variation of an Eezibleed out of a small regulator, some fittings,
and an old fliud resevoir cap and run it off of my compressor. The output
of the regulator is about 10 psi.

Of course, if you are using any of these systems, you must make sure that
the resevoir fluid level never gets too low or you will force air back into the
system at the worst possible point.

Craig,

	I don't believe there is any significant sagging. As a matter of
fact, I have a better time closing the door with the top off. But that
might be because I can hold the door itself and not the handle. Better
leverage that way. Either way, it doesn't close with a happy mechanical '
click' like the passenger side door does. It needs a hard slam to fully
latch. Alot of the time it closes, but doesn't fully latch, and I have to
try again...

Subject: Eezibleed and other systems

I guess I don't quite understand the advantages of these $30-40 bleeding
systems over the $2  1-way valve + a foot of clear pipe that I use.

Basically, my cheap system involves putting the 1-way valve over the
bleed nipple, cracking the nipple and pumping the brake, once one brake
is done I can then move onto the next brake.  All a one-man operation.

I'm only a newbie at doing my own work on my Porsche, so maybe this method
has disadvantages I am unaware of.

Please enlighten me on why anyone might want an Eezibleed.  The only reason
I can see is that my current setup involves me pumping the brakes.  However,
this is a big advantage over having the wife do it.

Am I missing something ?

PS  As a newbie I am always a bit wary of getting in the car when
it is jacked up with a wheel removed.  I use the jack stands and chock
the wheels, but it always scary to get in the car with one corner slightly
in the air.  Is this the big advantage to the $30 bleeder setups ?  Or is
my self-preservation instinct making me too paranoid.

Subject: Re: 924 perf modes

Hi Mike.
Not too many performance mods exist for the 924 -  but I would suggest the
following to start with:
Make sure you have the 1977 1/2 engine with the 110 Hp motor - if not, swap
one in (or the cylinder head at least).
Replace the stock throttle body with a (1980) 924 Turbo one.
Cut large holes (with a hole saw) in the pre-filtered side of the plastic air
box and install a K&N filter.
Remove as much smog stuff as you can - egr, cat, air pump (this stuff will
only slow you down and add weight) ... this of course depending where you are
located.
Bursch headers from Performance Products are quite good - seem durable as
well.  I use a Dynomax muffler as well which flows very nicely.
Check your fuel injectors - replace them if neccesary (these have a large
impact on performance)
Try advancing the timing 6 degrees or so - check for detonation though after
these changes.
Try Accell yellow 8mm plug wires - <much> cheaper and better than OEM.  You
can buy a universal fit set for a V-8 and have a spare set of four.  I use
Autolite Platinum plugs as well.
These changes have made my car a lot more driveable, and has very noticably
improved the acceleration between 4000 and 5000, where it had previously felt
rather asthmatic.  I estimate my car has 130 Hp or so - this is a subjective
test ... but my Dad's '87 924S doesn't get too far ahead during the
occasional stop light duel ;-)  The early 924's are quite light - and I think
the 4 speed is a bit better for acceleration than the 5 speed (mine shifs
very quickly). 
I have a list of places that offer various "more exotic" mods, like big valve
heads, porting etc - I will send it if you want.
Good luck with it - e-mail me if you need any clarification or whatever -

Taka:

One would think so, but it's not always that simple.

While most motorcycles have power-to-weight ratios far exceeding those 
of most Porsches, they don't corner anywhere near as hard.  In fact, if 
you exclude the really extreme comparisons -- like Eddie Lawson on his 
race bike vs. my sister in her Subaru -- most cars can SAFELY be driven 
faster than most motorcycles.

This is borne out by my personal experience blasting up and down Palomar 
Mountain and across the Ortega Highway.  Both are popular spots here in 
Southern California for motorcycle riders to flex their muscles, and you 
see a lot of high-end superbikes there on weekends (even saw a Bimota a 
couple of months ago).  A lot of the riders are fast, but it apparently 
takes way more talent (or bravery, or something) to quickly get those 
things around corners than it does to get a car to do the same thing.

Given that both participants care about living to see another day, I 
wouldn't be surprised to see Porsche drivers regularly passing 
motorcycle riders.

Haven't seen official test results upon the new 911 Turbo, but as for the 
Diablo...

Official manufacturer data is 4.0 seconds 0-60, top speed 202mph.
Car & Driver got 4.4 0-60 and 204mph, on an early Diablo (a non-VT - in other 
words, 2wd - the VTs are all-wheel-drive.)
Roadhandling was .95gs on the early Diablo, as well.

As for horsepower - as I recall, the new 911 Turbo is 408bhp, the Lambo Diablo 
is... Hold onto your hat! 492bhp, 428 lb-ft of torque.

Like I said, the 911 wouldn't stand a CHANCE against the Diablo. :)

Hello all,

Andy,
I know that cars are usually faster in corners than cycles.

However, as one person said, this commercial was on the Nurburgring, 
which is a racetrack. Unless the Porsche was passing the cycle in a sharp 
turn, it is unrealistic. Anyway, at every straight section, the cycle 
will blow away the Porsche. I think with enough straight-line speed, you 
can easily beat a Porsche with a motorcycle, even on a twisty course like 
the Nurburgring. This is assuming that the rider has equal riding skill 
to the driver's driving skill.

Porsches don't have a significant enough cornering advantage, IMHO, to 
counter the difference in acceleration between, say, a 911 Turbo and a ZX-11.

Anyone with more real-world experience with both Porsches and cycles care 
to share their thoughts?

BTW Andy, there's no need to make snide remarks.

up.  From that point forward it has not started.   No matter what I do.  I

Pete, thanks for your comments.  At, say, $2400/week x two or three weeks,
shipping over a Porsche still looks viable (i.e., cheaper).  And, the
opportunity to drive your own 356 in Germany is worth some kind of premium!

Your idea of a car-house swap might be worth exploring.  But, as someone who
averages a couple of trips a year to the U.K. and/or the continent (and once

I don't think it is very unrealistic. The car vs. motorcycle debate has been 
hashed over many times on rec.motorcycles, and in terms of numbers on a 
given racetrack the cars have a distinct advantage. It is true though 
that these numbers are being set by pure race machinery, and it is also 
true that your average sports motorcycle will have much more in common 
with it's racer counterpart than you average sports car. In terms of 
passing on the straights, while motorcycles have some advantage on 
acceleration, their inferior aerodynamics slow them down greatly. The 
hottest bikes out there are lucky to hit 200 tops, where this is 
commonly exceeded by cars. The ZX-11 has a top speed of 180, I believe. 
My RD could probably outrun most of the cars on this list 0-60, but on a 
track it would get eaten alive. The same would be true for I think any 
sportbike whatever the vintage. I think the best chance a motorcycle 
could have would be on a tighter track, where maneuverability and not 
maximum cornering ability is important.

At the risk of joining a flame war..........

I ride a motorcycle.  I drive a Porsche.  I have opinions.

The advantage of a motorcycle is the power to weight ratio,
and the low speed manouverability (sp?).

The advantage of a car is the low (air) drag, and the high
cornering forces.

I can't imagine any sane person racing a car and a bike at 
the same time, but I have seen car and bike races at the
same track:  Laguna Seca.  Cars are faster.

The "Camel" GTO cars typically pull laps that AVERAGE 40mph
faster than the unlimited (500cc factory) class bikes run.

wheel and can be left on for up to one hour.  You won't have to remove 
the wheels either.  I use it on the phone dials of my 84 Carrera with 
excellent results.  Price was about $7.00 a bottle.  Enought to do the

As sad as it makes me, to lose the charm and wit that you've contributed to

I can readily see that the instructions provided to you when you were welcomed

on the heel - although in fairness, it must be noted that *that* task is not

they *failed*, nonethless!  OK, OK, they didn't *all* fail, but *several* of

So here's what you need to do.  Send a message to our beloved Listmeister,

understand what I've written for you above, so I'll take care of this for you.

So, DMOON; fare well, old rutabega, come back when you can stay longer (Do
see about that mouth, first, won't you?)  Although we've known each other but 
briefly, I feel that I've known you well (well, as well as anyone would *want*

Adam,
I had the same symtoms about a year ago.  It turned out to be the shifter
linkage at the gear shift.  If you take the gear shift boot cover
off, you'll find that the transaxle shift bar connects to the
gear shift shaft at a pin that "tees" into it.  This pin became worn
like a banana and caused the slop.  I was able to find a used
shifter that wasn't worn and just replaced it.  There is a "wave" washer
that fits on the pin to keep the shift bar tight, it wasn't on mine
and probably got lost when I R&R the clutch several months earlier. 
I'm sure this was the cause, I haven't had any problems since.

Adam,

Yes, I think I know what your problem is (mine has it too!).  The rod
that connects the shift lever to the gearbox is going bad.  The opening
that connects to the shift lever is becoming oblong instead of round, and
that adds to the slopiness feel.  To check it, take off your shift boot
and the rubber boot underneath it, and look at the opening.  If the little
circlip is missing from the end and the end of the shift lever is worn
down to a point (instead of looking like a barrel), you found your problem!
The good news:  George B. has the part for cheap.  The BAD news:  You've
got to take the gearbox out to change the damn thing!  I'm waiting for
a warmer weekend to tackle this one......

Subject: 993 Turbo TV ad

Hi,

As you know, the new 911 turbo ad is out. People haven't really described it
very well. They missed the best part of the commercial. 

The ad starts by showing the gates of the Nurburgring opening and a narrator
saying something along the lines of- "In Germany anybody can pay and drive
around the famous Nurburgring". A fully laden Citroen 2CV is shown slowly
going around a corner and then a Diablo is seen going down a straight. Then
you see the 911 Turbo test driver drive up to the gate and hand over his
D-Marks. The narrator then says "This is were Porsche did all its' testing of
the new 400hp 911 turbo." You see the car sliding around the track and pass
the Diablo. Now the best part of the commercial is when the car is seen in
front of a Deutsche Bank  ATM and you see the test driver taking out money.
The narrator says "This isn't a car for a German test driver with an ATM
card." Implying that he will spend all his money going around the ring.  You
can see this ad on the Discovery channel on programs like Beyond 2000 or
Next. I've seen the ad on those programs the last 3 nights. There is also a
new Carrera ad that was shot in New Mexico or Arizona.

There was also a little preview article in the last Auto, Motor und Sport.
The turbo looks great. It has large openings in the front spoiler similar to
the new Toyota Supra. The rocker panels are deeper/lower and the rear is even
wider. The tail is all fiberglass, I guess rubber moulding wouldn't keep its'
shape at 180mph +. I'm not sure I like the new tail but I'll take the car
anyway. Factory numbers are 290kmh (181mph) top speed and 0-100kmh in 4.5
sec. 

Back to the turbo passing the Diablo. Porsche is one of the few manufacturers
that uses conservative performance numbers. How many times have there been
write-ups on Ferraris and Lamborghinis in which the car being tested either
had a problem which prevented top speed testing or the car didn't have the
power to reach the claimed top speed? The Porsches never seem to have that
problem. They always match or exceed the factory claims and they are real
cars that you can still drive to the grocery store everyday.

That's all folks!

Subject: drivability-Webber tuning

I now have about 500 miles on my rebuild and decided to do a checkup
on the motor. Compression test was fine with all showing about 125lbs.
Plug inspection showed that I need some tuning of the carbs. The 1st
problem I noticed was a miss at idle. I took the webber manual home
and studied the theory and application notes and then assumed that 
there was probabably a clogged idle jet in #3. I can't beleive it the
theoretical answer was the same as the application! Now the idle miss
is gone. I cleaned all the idle jets and the main jets on all three throats.
Last night a friend that has done this before "tuned" the carbs. Now
the motor sounds good. No backfiring and all cylindars seem to be firing
properly. I do have a problem with the fuel pump check valve as when it's
warm the fuel pump doesent shut off. A new one should be here Friday.
Something that I have always noticed with the car is a miss at about
2800-3000 rpm. I don't know if proper description is a miss but I loose
the power band at that point. It just isn't as smooth there, as thru most
of the power band. I have a new set of points on the way and will have
the fuel pump installed by Friday evening. Besides rebuilding the carbs
and having the distributer rebuilt, everything else is new or reconditioned.
Annyone have any ideas about the miss? I'm hoping that it is due to a lack
of fuel supply and come Friday I will have (at least) eliminated that area.

Subject: Cars vs. motorcycles

          ATTN: Minimal porsche content!

          Just got my latest p-phile digest and thought I could muddy
          the waters.

          I drive a 914 and ride a CBR600F2.  More importantly, I get
          various car and bike magazines.  In one of the bike mags
          there was a best-time race between a powerful, street legal
          bike you can buy at your local dealer (CBR900RR I believe)
          vs. a powerful, street legal car you can buy at your local
          dealer (NSX, or something like that).  The course: Willow
          Springs.  Even though the respected racer behind the WHEEL
          cheated by using shaved race compound tires, there was no
          contest -- the bike won.

          I could never beat a 911 on courses where top speed matters
          (e.g. Indy).  But the ol' 600 sure has surprised a few cars
          on the twisties:  they corner quite well (keeping up with
          the car in question) and then can shoot past them on a short
          straightaway.  Thus for the next turn I am in front, setting
          the cornering pace and then I can shoot farther ahead on the
          straights.

          Disclaimer: I am now older and wiser than the first year I
          had the bike and no longer "street race".  Cars definitely
          have the advantage in terms of cornering safety.  Leaning a
          bike more than 45 degrees just starts to get a bit scary! 
          Not to mention, possibly scarry!

Dear Michael,

Courtesy breeds same, so I'm happy to help.  Please note that this is a 
different message than a rude, discourteous and pre-emptory command, such as 
one sent by a person, who shall remain nameless (DMOON) sent recently.

As you are obviously new to the net, here's the scoop.  This is a mailing
list.  Lists come in many flavors, most run automatically by software on
a server that requires no human intervention.  In every case that I'm
aware of, you "subcribe" to join, and "unsubscribe" to leave the list.
You do this by sending email to a *different* address than the list
address.

In this case, as was explained in the rules you were provided when you
joined (subscribed), you send your unsubscribe request to our beloved
Listmeister, Stan Hanks (a real human being, not just some bozo who
*Plays* a human being on the internet) at our *request* address, to wit,

porschephiles-request@tta.com

I've done this as a courtesy to you, but please bear this message in
mind, in case you ever need to return to the list, temporarily or
permanently, or change to the *Digest* mode.

One final thought.  Traffic on this list is usually around 100 messages
per day.  Since this *is* a problem for you, you could send a message, to
the *REQUEST* ADDRESS, and request the *Digest* mode.  The digest mode
reduces your traffic to 1 to 3 messages, which contain *all* the
individual messages concatenated.

So you might want to think about this, fellow Porschephile, rather than
lose the best resource a Porsche lover ever had!

Subject: Re: "Unrealistic" Passing (was "993 Turbo ad")

Hey guys,
	Having moved from being a cold-hard all weather biker to a sunshine 
motorcyclist as well as Porsche and Beemer driver, let me share some of my 
experiences on this thread.  I will start by stating that there was recently a 
test of the fastest car from 0-100 *and* back down to 0.  For shits and giggles 
they also threw in a Kawasaki ZX-R, which is a potent bike by anybody's 
standards.  
	The *TOTAL* time for the bike to get from 0-100 *AND* back down to 0 was 
about 11 seconds.  This was FASTER than the fastest car (Porsche 911 turbo) 
could get to 100! (10.7 seconds)  With such unmatched accelerating and stopping 
power on the modern bikes (which are essentially track-technology with 
headlights) I would fear that a modern car (without extensive suspension 
modification) would not beat such a bike on a given track, unless it is 
exceedingly twisty.
	I have on many occasions won bets with my bike on a local track in 
Britain, whereby we would time the bike over three laps vs. a car over the same 
distance.  However I have also lost similar bets when the track gets reduced to 
a karting track.  The Nurburgring is *NOT* a karting track so on this occasion I 
am going to go with the bike.
	Unless it's an F1 car, of course...  Oh and before I forget; NO RAIN!!
Cheers,  Jan

Wow, 
	All this advice is great - at least some of it is lightening the mood,
so thanks to everyone.

  I still think the 930 will have to go - three girls wont fit even on weekends
and so it would be non family trips (i.e on my lonesome) but perhaps I can
last a little longer before I say the tearfull goodbye and fall back to just
one car - an all rounder

  What should that be? Well there appears to be very few which appeal both to
the heart, pocket and practicality but perhaps an Audi Q will fit the bill 
[RS2 are TOO new and expensive] or perhaps an older BMW M5/M3 about 5 
years old? Whatever I choose it will cause more pain than I imagined when I
got the 930 - as a bit of fun until I got fed up(!) if your fed up with this
car your fed up with life.

Subject: 928 CIS strangeness

my '79 928 (CIS) is having a strange problem that i noticed after the 
last tune-up
(it could've been around before that, and i just attributed it to 
needing a tune-up,
i don't remember if it behaved like this before or not.)  it starts 
fine, and runs OK
while warming up. once it warms up however, it has a rough idle, and it 
surges and
stumbles slightly at light throttle openings. from 1/2 throttle to WFO, 
it runs
great and pulls like a freight train.  i had originally thought it was 
the plugs, so i
changed them again, but it made no difference. i'm now thinking it is one of
three things:

	1) fuel distributor mis-adjusted to go with k&n air filter
		(although i would've thought i would've noticed this last
		year, when i put the k&n in).
	2) slight vacumn leak somewhere in the 9-bazillion hoses.
		(i've inspected pretty carefully, just short of ripping them
		all out and testing/replacing them)
	3) warmup-regulator sensed low bank account, and has finally
		barfed.

anything i've missed? does the rubber-hose and propane torch method of finding
vacumn leaks really work? anybody know where to get a 3mm, 8-inch hex driver
for adjusting the fuel distributor (besides from Porsche or Baum: $23! yeow.)?

To really rub it in, the Elan does it with 105 HP, or 115 HP for
the S3, if they allow them. I thought that would be of interest for
everyone who is trying to go from 200 HP to 300 HP so they can go

1) The one way valve will keep old fluid from being sucked back from the jar,
but it won't keep air from being sucked back past the threads of the opened

Subject: Car vs. motorcycle

Andy Warren points out that motorcycles aren't necessarily faster than cars.
 
A few years ago I served as tour guide around Weissach for motorcycle racers
Freddy Spencer and Randy?? Mamoula. They put on a big show for them, hauled
out a 962 and gave them fast rides around the test track. After he came in
from his ride, I asked Spencer what differences he perceived. He said that
the car accelerated and turned about as well as his GP bike, but it stopped
a hell of a lot better.

Subject: 993 Turbo ad on TV

 
There is all this, uh, appendage measuring on behalf of the new Porsche Turbo
and Lamborghini Diablo. Figures from Car and Drivel were quoted. As a
professional road tester, using the same equipment as C/D, I can tell you
that C/D has probably never seen a car go as fast as they claim it does.
They do the tests, then apply a "correction factor" which takes some time
off every car they test. This makes it look like they are the only ones who
know how to test a car because their numbers are invariably a few tenths of
a second faster than anybody else's. This sells magazines. Selling magazines
(or rather, the ads in magazines, and the more magazines you claim to sell,
the higher your advertising rates) is the only reason magazines are in
business.
 
Unless they rented a high-speed test track, I also doubt they have been to
the car's top speed. They like to test top speed in the early morning on
Detroit freeways.
 
I have personally experienced 0-60 in 4.25 seconds in the old 1990 3.6 liter
Turbo, on a cold day on a public road in Europe. (Turbos love cold). Backed
that up with 2 runs before the gendarmes got curious. Given nice, dense,
cold intake air, the new Turbo should run well under 4 seconds. I got the
quarter mile on the old model in 12.74 sec at 109.0 mph. Those are
uncorrected what-it-does-is-what-it-does numbers. There is NO WAY to
accurately apply an atmospheric correction to turbocharged cars, and even
normally aspirated is kind of iffy. The correction factors work in the dyno
test cell but were never intended for use on the road, or beyond the narrow
barometric pressure/temperature/humidity limits set in the SAE engine test
code. SAE says that if the temp in your lab is below x or above y, etc.,
figure on testing another day.
 
If there is any doubt about the Eenimobile being faster than the new Turbo,
there is a simple solution: wait a while. Sooner or later the Lambo will
break. You can beat on a Turbo all day long on the drag strip; I've
done it. Brumos Racing rolled Hans Stuck's IMSA Supercar winner out of the
trailer for me at the Pomona drag strip a couple of years ago, said "here's
the car, here's a full tank of gas, have fun, we'll be back in 3 hours." The
car had just won the championship the day before, it still had the worn race
rubber on it, nothing had been serviced (crew too busy celebrating). I ran
the tank dry, most of it at full throttle (wouldn't you?). I wouldn't bet on
the exotics taking the same sort of punishment.
 
Same caveat goes for the new Bugatti. I was at the introduction of the car
in France, and it looked good and all that, but car magazine people who have
driven one here in Southern California tell me that it's disappointing and
the reports that have actually appeared in print have been charitable to
put it mildly.
 
While I was at R&T I asked a senior editor why we kept putting these
unaffordable, undrivable Italian exotics on the cover, and writing stories
about how glorious they are. His reply was that 1) red cars on the cover,
especially red Italian cars, sells magazines and 2) we can't tell the truth
about them, it would only shatter the readers' dreams.
 
To be fair, I just had a Ferrari 355 and it's the first modern Ferrari I
really like. It didn't come off as a kit car at all. Reliability, who knows?
But it was an absolute kick to drive. Not an everyday kind of car, but a
great weekend toy. The Porsches, any Porsches, can be driven to work and
then used as a toy on weekends.

My quick guess (and the thing I forget until the last on my CIS cars) is the
rubber O-rings around the fuel injectors.

They get hard and no longer seal properly, allowing false air in.  Lousy
idle, but great every other time.

Check em, and save yourself a lot of time...

I agree on the fact the four wheeled vehicle have the advantage. They
can hold more speed through a turn. As for the top speed advantage?
Yes, full bred race cars and exotic supercars can break 200mph,
but so can the motorcycle counterparts. What about the 215mph turbo
charged ZX-11? What about an NSR500? These machines have hideously
high power to weight ratios. I don't think the NSR500 has actually
been given a track to find it's top speed. But yes, the cars will win
on a track given both are on equall footing. E.g. race vehicle to race
vehicle.

Subject: drivability-Webber tuning

I now have about 500 miles on my rebuild and decided to do a checkup
on the motor. Compression test was fine with all showing about 125lbs.
Plug inspection showed that I need some tuning of the carbs. The 1st
problem I noticed was a miss at idle. I took the webber manual home
and studied the theory and application notes and then assumed that 
there was probabably a clogged idle jet in #3. I can't beleive it the
theoretical answer was the same as the application! Now the idle miss
is gone. I cleaned all the idle jets and the main jets on all three throats.
Last night a friend that has done this before "tuned" the carbs. Now
the motor sounds good. No backfiring and all cylindars seem to be firing
properly. I do have a problem with the fuel pump check valve as when it's
warm the fuel pump doesent shut off. A new one should be here Friday.
Something that I have always noticed with the car is a miss at about
2800-3000 rpm. I don't know if proper description is a miss but I loose
the power band at that point. It just isn't as smooth there, as thru most
of the power band. I have a new set of points on the way and will have
the fuel pump installed by Friday evening. Besides rebuilding the carbs
and having the distributer rebuilt, everything else is new or reconditioned.
Annyone have any ideas about the miss? I'm hoping that it is due to a lack
of fuel supply and come Friday I will have (at least) eliminated that area.

Speaking of 993 ads...  Has anyone seen the 993 video made by Porsche

Awesome footage of a 993 on a race track, Danny Sullivan in the cockpit
talking to the camera saying "It's not something I recommend that you
do, driving 130 MPH with one hand, but I just want to show how capable
this car is.  Far better than the C2" (slightly paraphrased)  Also
Hurly Haywood talking about the rear suspension...

The best footage is a slow motion oversteering drift with some opposite
lock.  The actual driving scenes are too few IMHO.

Mainly, it's a stroke of marketing genious for it's "right brain"
emotional appeal.  If you watch this video and don't want a 911,
you'll never have to wonder if this car is for you.

A great line:  "A car not meant to be for everyone, but
everything to some" ....  Again from memory, so forgive me the details.

Boy, Andy, while I don't disagree with your statement comparing ultimate
cornering capabilities, I am surprised that you regularly smoke motorcycles
on your highway run. In another part of Southern California, the run up the
Angeles Crest Highway, it is very rare for a four-wheeler--Porsche or not--
to outrun a motorcycle. It is, in fact, becoming much more of a problem
during runs up the Crest, as immortal teens frequently end up--in your
lane--at high speeds. While motorcycles rule the roost on this roadway, the
closest thing I saw to  challenge a two-wheeler was a Ford RS200 Group B
rally car, fully kitted. I expect the reason for the motorcycle edge over
cars is the tightness of the intitial 10-15 miles of the Crest--cars cannot
accelerate out of the slow turns as fast as bikes, so any edge 4-wheelers
have is muted.

I don't know about Willow Springs, but I do know about Portland Int'l

the practice sessions for the 1993 Indy Car race:  1:06:03.  Or about 104 mph
average.  GT1 race cars usually have times about 1:12 or so, 911's and 951's
are in the low 1:20's - 1:22's.

500cc Motorcycle races usually lap at about 1:16 - 1:22.

Subject: Panel flanging & body shop tools

A couple of weeks ago there was a discussion about panel flanging tools,
used to put a step or jog in sheet metal panels to make neat lap joints. My
feeling, and that of others, was that this is not the best way to go, but
was sometimes unavoidable.
 
Anyway, I'm looking through the latest flyer from "Auto Body Toolmart"
(1-800-382-1200) and they have a flanger for use in a standard air hammer,
for $24.95. I think Eastwood wants lots more for one.
 
There is also an air tool called an "Astro straight grip punch flange" which
appears to do two things -- punch holes or flange panels. I'm not familiar
with it, but at $78.95, if indeed it does both jobs, it's a steal.
 
They also have various American-made jack systems, including the two-post
screw type that lifts from the center of the car, at $3 or $4K depending,
and what I think would be neater for my garage, a pantograph-type system
that also lifts from the center, but you drive over it and it lifts the car
12, 18, 22 or 25 inches from the ground, plenty for the sort of stuff I do,
and I don't have the headroom to lift a car more than 4 feet or so clear of
the ground before hitting the main ceiling beam. $1700.
 
Anybody who does any of their own bodywork should call them and ask to get
on the mailing list. Lots of brand names, not (just) People's Republic of
China junk. Looking through it, I even see Porsche-specific tools, like
clamps to attach a 911 to a Champ #3000 Unibench for pulling the frame. Not
that most of us have the skills or tools to start tugging on a 911 frame,
but that's the sort of market this company sells to.

I'm not sure if your 1:29 or so was set before Willow was repaved (with wider
and smoother turns one and five),
but over the winter Superbike (NOT GP machinery) times dipped into the
1:23's. Having said this, on the vast majority of tracks REAL race cars are
substantially faster than REAL race motorcycles, due to the substantially
higher cornering forces 4-wheelers can generate. In fact, in this month's
RACER magazine, there is a comparison between GP bikes and Formula 1
cars--check it out.

Larry,
My gear shift lever (verses the transaxle shift tube) was worn. Your 
correct, if the shift tube is worn at the gear shift lever pin then 
you do have to remove the transaxle. Mine was okay and just the
shift lever pin was bad.  This only takes a few minutes and 
simple tools to remove (be careful not to drop bolts down around
the torque tube). I just removed the cir-clip and slipped the
transaxle shift tube off, then un-bolted the gear shift lever base 
from the torque tube. 
If the transaxle shift tube is in the way, you can loosen the connection
at the transaxle to give some front/back movement.

Goodluck...

Please don't damage your museum piece 914-6 in stock PCA racing events!

Stock 914-6 brakes work well with orange cool carbon brake pads and DOT-4
brake fluid. This combination will give you the extra bite you need. As a
passing note, make sure that the non-stock spoiler is not interfering with
front brake cooling. 911T calipers were originally fitted to the 914-6 and
the aluminum S calipers have too large a mounting to bolt to the to the "six"
struts and easily warp and/or corrode. But they are lightweight!

In the stock PCA class "I" in which your 914 runs, you may substitute any of
the stock braking setups originally supplied by the factory for that type of
vehicle. Since 914-6 models (except for 914-6 GT and 916) never were supplied
by the factory with anything else but 911T front (and virtually rear) brakes,
that is what we are relegated to using - sorry.

By removing the backpad, there are many different racing seats that will sit
lower, but not necessarily look good in your 914! You must be one of those
height-impaired individuals - huh? My dad and brother both tower over me
(they are over 6 feet) and cannot fit in 914s either!

With a remote oil cooler, we are not so worried about air flowing under the
car to cool the engine, but are worried about brake cooling and high speed
lift. If racing over 115MPH the 914 in stock dress becomes too light. Hence,
we need spoilers to keep it firmly planted on the ground. This means both
front and rear spoilers.

The best combination is a front euroflex air dam with oil cooler cutout area
and brake cooling holes along with and A.I.R. rear extend ducktail spoiler.
This combination certainly increases down force and top end handling.

Testing the 1.7,2.0 auxillary air valve is easy. When cold, blow through it.
If it is closed, it is bad. Next connect a 12 volt battery to the positive
red lead and the aux air valve case. As the valve heats (approx. five
minutes), it will close and you cannot blow through it. If it is not closed
in five or so minutes, it is bad.

To repair this valve (new ones are no longer available), pry around the top
crimped portion and remove the top. You will find the slider valve to have
rusted, stuck from years of crankcase vapor. Simply sand, clean and lubricate
the valve until it slides freely and reassemble silicone, gluing the top.
This device is absolutely necessary for proper and smooth cold engine
running.

As an added note, some have installed a 1.8 air valve in the original's
place. It does not fit, looks totally out of place (especially for concours!)
and does not open as wide as the original. If desperate, use it. It is cheap!

Finally, your mechanic used the old BB in the decel line trick.

As the deceleration valve causes a momentary vacuum leak as programmed by the
factory, it enables the idle to return more slowly and dilutes the parts per
million exhaust emmissions. Additionally, it prevents the rapid fall to idle
and subsequent stalling. when the diaphram in this device breaks or sticks,
the idle remains high because of a constant vacuum leak. Installing a BB in
the small vacuum line virtually disables the device.

As a quick fix, try spraying WD-40 into the decel valve and evacuate and let
off several times to free the diaphram. If it will not evacuate, it is bad
and needs expensive replacement. Good luck!

Another possibility is that the fuel line is pinched.  I had this problem

sway bar pinched the line when cornering in one direction (I can't remember

Subject: Oil, etc.----YOU SHOULD READ THIS!

Hello to all fellow P-philers,

There has been much debate raging lately in regard to oil change intervals, 
types of oil, filters, synthetics, etc.  I would like to, however, bring up 
another related point.  That is the point of oil additives.  NOW BEFORE YOU 
GO AND IMMEDIATELY DELETE THIS MESSAGE, BEAR WITH ME.  I know this topic has 
proliferated here before, but I would like to add what I *think* is a new twist.

It is rather clearly stated in the FAQ that oil additives are generally 
considered *not-good*.  The following was taken (without permission--sorry) 
from the FAQ :
Stan comments "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ISN'T JUST 
PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil."  Bruce Anderson calls such additives 
"a cash flow device".  It is also mentioned that Slick 50 is *evil* in an 
aluminum engine, and that DuPont has categorically stated that (the 
frequently found ingredient) teflon is useless in such applications.  

It's obvious that the FAQ consensus is *forget oil additives, especially 
those containing teflon*.  I have, however, come in contact with another 
particular additive, and I wish to get everyone's brains moving on this one. 
 It is, to the best of my knowledge, a "different" type of additive, and it 
is not well known or advertized.  This product is called MILITEC-1 and it is 
distributed by Advanced Product Distributors, Inc., and it boasts some 
extensive capabilities.

According to my info., Militec-1 is a *metal conditioner* that dramatically 
reduces friction between metal surfaces.  It is an oil that gets into 
micropores of the metal and bonds there, protecting the metal surfaces 
without depending on the film strength of the oil, and the bond remains even 
through oil changes as it has become part of the metal itself.  It **DOES 
NOT CONTAIN** any solid particles such as metals or ***P.T.F.E. ( 
Polytetrafluoroethylene---that's "teflon")***, nor does it contain 
chlorinated paraffins or other harmful chemicals.  It is the only product 
added to oil that has been certified and approved in both *federal 
government* and heavy industry. Documentation is available for comparing 
Militec-1 with the independant documentation for other products.  It works 
in both extremely hot and cold temperatures, protecting against cold starts 
and overheating abuse.  Militec-1 is compatible with regular synthetic oils, 
transmission fluids and greases.  It is designed to be used in relatively 
small amounts on many moving parts:

Militec-1 is effective at a ratio of only 1.5 ounces per quart of oil for 
most applications.  Most engines will require 6 to 8 ounces every 15,000 
miles regardless of the number of oil changes during that period.  The 
transmission needs a total of only 4 ounces every 30,000 miles.  Add 2 
ounces to the differential and 1 ounce to the power steering.  For these 
sealed units, apply every 30,000 miles.  The MSRP is $18.95 for an 8-ounce 
bottle, and $29.45 for the 16-ounce bottle.

Militec claims to provide many advantages.  It can achieve 5% to 15% better 
fuel economy.  It can reduce wear by *95%* and more, and that means reduced 
maintenance costs.  It is extremely resistant to water and antifreeze, thus, 
contamination of oil has almost no effect on Militec-1's ability to 
lubricate.  It allows for greater available power by reducing energy wasted 
on internal friction.  It is claimed that *unlike other products that are 
added to oil* Militec-1 is independently documented to be completely safe.  
Militec-1 works in environments where oil has lost its effectiveness due to 
heat and stress. Likewise, Militec-1 works in environments where oil has 
become contaminated by particles, water, solvents, etc. and it also reduces 
corrosion and rust.  It also helps reduce engine wear when it is at its 
worst, *at start up*, because Militec-1 lubricates moving parts before oil 
begins flowing.  It is also advantageous for cars that are driven cold 
without being warmed up first, as well as for cars involved in stop and go 
commuting.

I came in contact with this product a while back, and I was unsure as to its 
true worth.  Then, I recently came in contact with it again at a booth at 
the Auto Show.  I spoke at length with the representative.  I questioned why 
the product seemed to me to be so obscure and unpublicized when compared to 
other products such as Slick-50.  Was it a hoax?  He simply reminded me that 
Militec does very little advertising, unlike Slick-50, and their major 
market is government agencies and the like.  He explained to me (if my 
memory serves me correctly) that the teflon contained in Slick-50 is 
designed to essentially "melt" and "bond" to engine parts to provide its 
lubricating properties, but for this process to take place, the engine had 
to reach a *very* high temperature (I forged the exact number) that was 
highly unlikely that most any engine would ever reach.  Thus, the 
"un-bonded" Slick-50 fluid is almost completely drained out of the engine 
along with the oil at the first oil change.  Militec-1, on the other hand, 
requires a much lower and common engine temperature at which it reacts with 
the engine parts, and it actually *becomes* part of the metal itself.  The 
rep then proceeded to conduct a rather convincing demonstration of his 
product.  Obviously, such a demonstration is designed to convince the buyer 
about the advantages of Militec-1, and I realize that it is entierely 
possible that such a demonstration might be set-up or "rigged" in such a way 
as to exaggerate or falsely create a believable product.  Being the 
skepticist that I am, I carefully watched the demo, and IMHO it seemed to be 
very legitimate and truthful.  I (the observer) was able to choose which 
products I wanted to compare Militec-1 to.  I chose a comparison of 
Militec-1 to conventional oil (what I use), and another test compared to 
Slick-50.  In both tests Militec-1 had clearly superior lubricating 
abilities.  If anyone is interested in exactly how the test was carried out, 
just write me and I will post that info as well.

Ok, this is a lot of fact and a lot of marketing lingo, *BUT* how much of it 
is true?  The above info stems largely from sales literature, which 
obviously fails to mention the disadvantages of Militec-1..........*if there 
are any*.   So, that is my question......Does anyone know anything about 
this stuff?  *IN THEORY* this sounds like some *GOOD S&#T*, but in actuality 
is it as good as it sounds?  Does anyone have any experience with using 
Militic-1 in both the short-term and in the long-term?  Can anyone shed some 
*new* light on oil additives and Militec-1.  I'm looking for some 
legitimate, factually based responses rather than a bunch of hyped up 
opinations, etc.  Perhaps Stan, with his earlier wisdom and comments 
regarding oils and oil additives, has some new comments in regard to 
Militec-1.........or does it too fall into the category of "Snake Oil"? 

Sorry about the length, but I felt it was necessary to provide all the 
facts.  I hope this gets everyone thinking about their cars and their oil, 
and I hope the wisdom of the net can open up the truth about this stuff.  It 
***sounds*** like a great product.  Is it?   Let me know what you think!

Subject: Is motor-flushing my 944 a bad idea?

My '84 944 (59k miles) has a couple symptoms that point to a possible
stuck piston ring.  It burns 1qt oil per 500 miles, and has
poor leak-down (20%) past one ring.  As best as I could tell
looking through the spark plug hole, the cylinder wall is OK.

Without actually pulling the engine apart, the 'stuck ring' theory is
only a guess, but two different mechanics suggested that I try
to unstick the ring with one of the 5 minute motor flushes such as Gunk.
Two other mechanics said they wouldn't risk the possibility
of the flush breaking a particle free and doing some damage.
I did try a couple treatments of Techron, but with no improvement.

So, does a motor-flush have much chance of helping?  of hurting?
Any other thoughts?  Is a rebuild the only safe way out?

Bikes corner just as hard as cars, unless the cars have downforce.
A production sportbike vs a production sportscar on most racetracks
(ones with turns, that is...) will be "no contest" -
the bike will waltz away in the straights. This assumes "very competent"
driving for both machines...

Race machines are a different matter - a racecar can generate about 3Gs of
aerodynamic downforce, which means that they can corner at about 4Gs, while
the race bikes are stuck at 1.2Gs, or thereabouts, since they have to make
do with "mechanical grip".

This sounds like a product I heard of recently.
Something about submicrom borate speres acting as tiny ball bearings.
They are delivered to the end user suspended in mineral oil.

Here's the deal: street motorcycles win against street cars on race 
tracks, if both are driven by highly competent pilots. The last test I 
saw was of a CBR900RR on street-compound tires ridden by Nick Ienatch 
(sp?) (long racing resume, current _Sport Rider_ editor) roasting an NSX on 
autocross tires driven by the US NSX champion or something. They ran at 
both Willow Springs and Streets of Willow, the latter being a tight road 
course. The upshot is this: in those conditions, the bike's ability to 
accelerate out of a turn overcomes the car's ability to brake later and 
drive faster through the turn. This mirrors contests I've seen between 
ZR-1s and FZR1000s, and FZR1000s and Caterham Super 7s (aka Lotus Super 7s).

Now, it should be pointed out that the average driver (ie me) can 
typically go faster by bike than by car. A determined car driver should 
be able to smoke by me on a typical twisty road. Csaba Csere brought it 
home in an editorial a while back where he tells of catching a GSXR1100 
rider on the Pacific Coast highway while driving a 5 or 7 series BMW (!). 
His point was he could drive closer to the margins of the car than the 
rider could ride to the margins of the bike. 

On the other hand, in many a day of sporting riding, I have caught many
sports cars (including a lipstick red 944) and have not been passed (to my
recollection) at all. 

Finally, at the high end: GP500 motorcycles, weighing around 300 lbs and 
with about 180 hp, are no match for F1 cars, IndyCars, or likely even 
NASCARs. 

Finally Finally, Nurburgring: Serious biker v. Serious Porschephile, honor 
or worse on the line, the Porsche will start losing from the starting 
line and will never catch up.

George,

Ok, Ok maybe you're right about the CASH-BLOW DEVICE, but I think you missed 
my point.  Granted, I have not read all the archives, but everything I have 
come across so far hasn't mentioned anything about Militec-1.  Most info 
only shoots down Slick 50 (rightfully so) and generalizes about *all* oil 
additives.  THE WHOLE REASON I WENT INTO SUCH DETAIL AND LENGTH WAS TO SHOW 
THAT THIS STUFF IS NOT THE SAME AS SLICK 50.  I am **NOT** trying to be 
obnoxious and start a big flame war, but what I specifically didn't want was 
someone to tell me to buzz off.  I thought maybe someone (unaffiliated with 
Militec's makers) out there in cyber-space could shed some genuine truth on 
this *particular product*.  **WHY** IS IT A CASH FLOW DEVICE IF IT HAS 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER ADDITIVES???? 

I am not whining here, and if it is a cash-blow device, then I will accept 
it for what it is.  All I want to know is WHY is it a cash-blow device.  
Does anyone have any FACTS that may differ from the usual Slick 50 garble.  
You say some people never learn, but I would rather learn from honest 
factual info. rather than a buncha people simply telling me to save my $$$$. 
 I think it's much more useful to know WHY the stuff is no good rather than 
simply being told that it is so.

Thanks,

This seems to agree with the conclusions of this debate which have been
generated most of the other places it has been discussed. The typical
conclusion is that on a race track with comparable driver/riders, street
bikes beat street cars, but race cars beat race bikes, assuming roughly
the same level of "vehicular intensity" (super bikes against super cars,
top class racing bikes against F1 or other "top end" race cars).

Good point! The 1500 pound weight is the big advantage. If they
could adjust their alignment like a 911 or use a decent size
wheel/tire they would be unbelievable. Actually this makes it
a Street Prepared Elan, and Scott Jessen will tell you how fast
THEY are against a 250 HP modified early 911... an Elan
should not be beaten by a 911 unless the driver screws up (which

Hello all,

My 84 928S clutch is having the following symptom.

I feel that the clutch pedal is not sprung back
all the way after I stepped on it. Also, I feel it 
is not as tight as before. I don't know how to 
describe it best, but it feels like I'm stepping on a 
sponge. Now, I can't rev the engine over 3000rpm. 
I asked myself, I guess it is the clutch hydralic pump. 

The questions: 

 1) How should I diagnostic the problem? 
 2) If I have the workshop manual, can I do it 
    myself with reasonable tools?
 3) If I take it to a shop, about how much am I
    looking at?

Subject: More 914 quirks...

Doctor Doctor!
	I recently gave Gretchin a thorough tuning and found that, after 
replacing and optimizing all ignition components (New points made the 
biggest difference) that she idled WAY too high.  I COMPLETELY closed the 
idle screw and STILL it was too high.  My auxiliary air valve was not the 
cause, it is working fine and plus I plugged it anyway to be sure.  I 
still have a warm idle of 2300 RPM!
	So I took my unlit propane torch and went over all the lines when 
the car was running to see if I could detect a change in idle speed 
indicating an air leak, ad nauseum (literally)  with no effect.  I can 
turn the idle down by changing the points setting, but I trust the 
dwell-meter settings at factory specs.  Is that wrong?  Then of course 
there's that adjusting screw on the pressure sensor which I've never been 
too sure of...  So I'm out of ideas here...
	While we are on quirks, I just noticed yesterday that my steerin 
wheel jerks on rare ocassion a bit, and I think I have localized the 
problem to my left outer brake caliper, which seems to be rubbing against 
the disk for some unknown reason.  The pads and disks are a year old and 
in good shape, so I fear for my calipers.  I have sooo little time to 
mess these days with my primary source of transportation that I was 
wondering if someone might give me a clue as to what I'm getting into 
before I try to take it all apart this weekend and find I need parts or

I've seen a 928 belt about 4-5 years old that was dry rotted!
The belt didnt have that many miles on it.

Inspect your belts and replace if they look worn or cracked.

Bottom line:

If this were a legitimate item that would make, say, a difference of one-half
mile pergallon difference in a fleet of cars, Ford and GM  and Chrysler 
would be putting the stuff in all of their cars in order to beat the 
CAFE standards and save themselves billions of dollars in development 
cost.

Since they are not using it, QED, this stuff is not worth it.

(Although you can order it right from Quick n Brite Inc.) So here's how I
used it. The interior of the '73 911T was kinda crappy and the case being
that sunvisors are rather unavailable, I decided to try and clean them
(couldn't hurt, they were brown).

Anyways, I believe that because it is all biodegradable and concentrated
that it cleans well and keeps the moisture in the leather and vinyl. Either

Hello, Khang,

One of two problems:

1) the coolant valve (which controls how much coolant is allowed into the
heater core, and thus how much heat) may be either non-functional (due to a
bad vacuum diaphragm) or may have a hole in it allowing hot coolant through,
even though the diaphragm is pulling it closed.  Cheap thing to fix.

2) The AC control switch is broke. EXPEN$IVE... Dealer price is $660, used
price is $225.

good luck

I'm not a petrochemist, but I know a lot of them. Ditto on metallurgy,
engine dynamics, etc.

The only things I've even *HEARD* of that has any promise as an additive
isn't even an additive -- it's a complete lubrication replacement using
buckyballs suspended in some polycarbonate ester. Of course, it requires a
ground-up lubrication system replacement, and double of course, would *NOT*
be advisable in any air-cooled application where most of the heat load
is borne by the oil...

I'm *VERY* skeptical about anything that says anything about bonding,
pore filling, or particulate adhesion to promote surface smoothing 
all in the name of reducing friction. There's a *LOT* more going on to 
create friction -- side loads, expansion of materials from heat, etc
than can be compensated for in this way. In fact, the "traditional" break
in period on an engine is a time in which the moving parts self-conform
and there *SHOULD* be no major friction left from rough surfaces, etc.
at that point.

Horse puckey, most likely. Again.

Subject: 914 car stereo

I'm curious to know what other 914 owners have done with respect to stereo
design and speaker placement. I just bought my 2nd 914 (a 95% restored 1974
2.0) and have about $1000 to spend on stereo equipment. Any suggestions?

Also, is the center console standard on the 1974? My 1970 didn't have one.
It's cheesy and I'm planning on removing it.

Finally, I'm happy to have joined the list (as of today)!

Taka, Kyle, and Andy:

Don't know about the new 993 Turbo vs the Diablo, but I have driven
Nurburgring a few times in years past with all sorts of "conveyances" for
comparison (Tour buses, family sedans, racing bikes, factory test cars, etc).
 Also a few  "restricted" ??? sessions for performance sedans, sport cars,
and racing motorcycles.  One such session had a good variety of full fairing
racing bikes (Hondas, Kaws, Suzukis, MVs, Ducatis, etc) and a wide assortment
of Ferrari TRs, 288 GTOs, Porsche 934/935s, MB AMG "Hammers" ,  and at least
one Countach.

On the 22 km long Nordschleife, particularly on the backside (sorry I don't
remember the turn names but it's on the Adenauer side) the track elevation
drops dramatically  with a series of almost continuous turns on a relatively
rough and usually always damp track surface.  The performance cars
consistently passed the bikes and drove deeper into the corners where the
intervening straight was short enough that the bikes superior "lo end"
acceleration didn't help.  These appeared to be well ridden machines (I owned
a  KZ 1000 at the time ) but their braking and setup for the corners allowed
the cars to get by.

Similarly, on the front straight (leading up to what was the old Hotel
"Tribune") the cars passed the bikes about a third of the way up at  speeds
of probably  220-240 kph.

I had a excellent vantage point going into the corners since about everything
passed me.....

Also, if you've seen the video of the Ruf Yellow Bird on Nurburgring, the
cars like to use enough oversteer in the corners to convince the bikers to
stay away!

Yes. Spend it on a nice home system upgrade. 

In a well-done 914, with the top off, you'll not be able to hear it

Hello to all fellow P-philers,

There has been much debate raging lately in regard to oil change intervals, 
types of oil, filters, synthetics, etc.  I would like to, however, bring up 
another related point.  That is the point of oil additives.  NOW BEFORE YOU 
GO AND IMMEDIATELY DELETE THIS MESSAGE, BEAR WITH ME.  I know this topic has
proliferated here before, but I would like to add what I *think* is a new twist.


It is rather clearly stated in the FAQ that oil additives are generally 
considered *not-good*.  The following was taken (without permission--sorry) 
from the FAQ :
Stan comments "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ISN'T JUST 
PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil."  Bruce Anderson calls such additives 
"a cash flow device".  It is also mentioned that Slick 50 is *evil* in an 
aluminum engine, and that DuPont has categorically stated that (the 
frequently found ingredient) teflon is useless in such applications.

It's obvious that the FAQ consensus is *forget oil additives, especially 
those containing teflon*.  I have, however, come in contact with another 
particular additive, and I wish to get everyone's brains moving on this one.
 It is, to the best of my knowledge, a "different" type of additive, and it
is not well known or advertized.  This product is called MILITEC-1 and it is 
distributed by Advanced Product Distributors, Inc., and it boasts some 
extensive capabilities.

According to my info., Militec-1 is a *metal conditioner* that dramatically 
reduces friction between metal surfaces.  It is an oil that gets into 
micropores of the metal and bonds there, protecting the metal surfaces 
without depending on the film strength of the oil, and the bond remains even 
through oil changes as it has become part of the metal itself.  It **DOES 
NOT CONTAIN** any solid particles such as metals or ***P.T.F.E. ( 
Polytetrafluoroethylene---that's "teflon")***, nor does it contain 
chlorinated paraffins or other harmful chemicals.  It is the only product 
added to oil that has been certified and approved in both *federal 
government* and heavy industry. Documentation is available for comparing 
Militec-1 with the independant documentation for other products.  It works 
in both extremely hot and cold temperatures, protecting against cold starts 
and overheating abuse.  Militec-1 is compatible with regular synthetic oils, 
transmission fluids and greases.  It is designed to be used in relatively 
small amounts on many moving parts:

Militec-1 is effective at a ratio of only 1.5 ounces per quart of oil for 
most applications.  Most engines will require 6 to 8 ounces every 15,000 
miles regardless of the number of oil changes during that period.  The 
transmission needs a total of only 4 ounces every 30,000 miles.  Add 2 
ounces to the differential and 1 ounce to the power steering.  For these 
sealed units, apply every 30,000 miles.  The MSRP is $18.95 for an 8-ounce 
bottle, and $29.45 for the 16-ounce bottle.

Militec claims to provide many advantages.  It can achieve 5% to 15% better 
fuel economy.  It can reduce wear by *95%* and more, and that means reduced 
maintenance costs.  It is extremely resistant to water and antifreeze, thus, 
contamination of oil has almost no effect on Militec-1's ability to 
lubricate.  It allows for greater available power by reducing energy wasted 
on internal friction.  It is claimed that *unlike other products that are 
added to oil* Militec-1 is independently documented to be completely safe. 
Militec-1 works in environments where oil has lost its effectiveness due to 
heat and stress. Likewise, Militec-1 works in environments where oil has 
become contaminated by particles, water, solvents, etc. and it also reduces 
corrosion and rust.  It also helps reduce engine wear when it is at its 
worst, *at start up*, because Militec-1 lubricates moving parts before oil 
begins flowing.  It is also advantageous for cars that are driven cold 
without being warmed up first, as well as for cars involved in stop and go 
commuting.

I came in contact with this product a while back, and I was unsure as to its 
true worth.  Then, I recently came in contact with it again at a booth at 
the Auto Show.  I spoke at length with the representative.  I questioned why 
the product seemed to me to be so obscure and unpublicized when compared to 
other products such as Slick-50.  Was it a hoax?  He simply reminded me that 
Militec does very little advertising, unlike Slick-50, and their major 
market is government agencies and the like.  He explained to me (if my 
memory serves me correctly) that the teflon contained in Slick-50 is 
designed to essentially "melt" and "bond" to engine parts to provide its 
lubricating properties, but for this process to take place, the engine had 
to reach a *very* high temperature (I forged the exact number) that was 
highly unlikely that most any engine would ever reach.  Thus, the 
"un-bonded" Slick-50 fluid is almost completely drained out of the engine 
along with the oil at the first oil change.  Militec-1, on the other hand, 
requires a much lower and common engine temperature at which it reacts with 
the engine parts, and it actually *becomes* part of the metal itself.  The 
rep then proceeded to conduct a rather convincing demonstration of his 
product.  Obviously, such a demonstration is designed to convince the buyer 
about the advantages of Militec-1, and I realize that it is entierely 
possible that such a demonstration might be set-up or "rigged" in such a way 
as to exaggerate or falsely create a believable product.  Being the 
skepticist that I am, I carefully watched the demo, and IMHO it seemed to be 
very legitimate and truthful.  I (the observer) was able to choose which 
products I wanted to compare Militec-1 to.  I chose a comparison of 
Militec-1 to conventional oil (what I use), and another test compared to 
Slick-50.  In both tests Militec-1 had clearly superior lubricating 
abilities.  If anyone is interested in exactly how the test was carried out, 
just write me and I will post that info as well.

Ok, this is a lot of fact and a lot of marketing lingo, *BUT* how much of it 
is true?  The above info stems largely from sales literature, which 
obviously fails to mention the disadvantages of Militec-1..........*if there 
are any*.   So, that is my question......Does anyone know anything about 
this stuff?  *IN THEORY* this sounds like some *GOOD S&#T*, but in actuality 
is it as good as it sounds?  Does anyone have any experience with using 
Militic-1 in both the short-term and in the long-term?  Can anyone shed some 
*new* light on oil additives and Militec-1.  I'm looking for some 
legitimate, factually based responses rather than a bunch of hyped up 
opinations, etc.  Perhaps Stan, with his earlier wisdom and comments 
regarding oils and oil additives, has some new comments in regard to 
Militec-1.........or does it too fall into the category of "Snake Oil"?

Sorry about the length, but I felt it was necessary to provide all the 
facts.  I hope this gets everyone thinking about their cars and their oil, 
and I hope the wisdom of the net can open up the truth about this stuff.  It 
***sounds*** like a great product.  Is it?   Let me know what you think!

This statement reminded me of a car I saw at our local pcar repair
shop yesterday.  While wandering amidst various Porsches in need of
repair, I saw what appeared to be a nice SC with the rear up on car
ramps.  I walked over and saw that the lower valve covers had been 
removed and that one of them contained a couple of broken head studs.
Ouch.  The mechanic then suggested I take a look at the #3 exhaust
valve rocker shaft.  It had backed almost completely out!!  I half expected
the rocker arm to fall out.  I also noticed that the valve adjustment
locknuts were so covered in crud that they were barely visible.  The
entire underneath of the car looked like a refinery - due to the leaking
engine oil cooler.  I then stood up and looked in the engine compartment
and saw something a little out of the ordinary.  You know those little
needles that you use to pump up footballs, volleyballs, etc?  One was
being used as a FUSE in the fusebox noted in the above post!!!!  It had been
there for awhile, too.  The car also had three different brands of tires
on it, and it was a white car that had been painted black - and they
missed a few spots.

Having seen all of this, I asked what I thought was an obvious question -
"What was the car brought in for?".  The mechanic simply replied, "Won't
go into 5th gear".

This car is for sale - as soon as 5th gear gets fixed.  I'll get the number
for you....<vbg>.

Does anyone know what production car holds the record for the fastest lap

My dated memory says its the Nissan Skyline GT-R or the Acura NSX. Please

you'll unavoidably press two pedals when you try to brake...)

David:

While Stan's correct about the difficulty of getting a car stereo to 
compete with the noise generated by a 914, there are a couple of things 
you CAN do.

Buy an amp.  It doesn't have to be good, just loud.  50W/channel is more 
than enough.

Speaker placement is a real problem.  The obvious locations are in the 
lower-front corners of the doors and in the kick-panels just in front of 
the doors (in the outer corners of the footwells).

As long as you still have the center console, you can fit a couple of 8" 
drivers (back-to-back, firing out the sides of the console) in there.

Several companies make headrest-mounted speakers that'll make it easier 
to hear the stereo while the top's down; naturally, the sound quality is 
somewhat less than excellent.

 -Andy

P.S.  I wouldn't spend $1K on the thing; after $3-400, you'll probably 
be well into diminishing returns.

humorous writing, what appear to be honest road tests, and they're a bunch of 
lunatics, like me. (Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Rally? Car vs

They do use a high-speed test track, and a fifth wheel at all times - which I 
daresay you didn't use when you came up with "4.25 seconds" on an older 911 
Turbo.

It's German. But that doesn't mean it won't break. But it's unfair to assume that 
the Diablo will break more often than any other car.

I have middling respect for R&T, and mostly for their old-car stuff. I despise that 
right-wing jerk (PJ O'Rourke? or someone else) who writes for them, and their 
covers are apalling. The ONLY time they don't have a red car on the cover is 
when you can't see the car in red, like the Viper GTS coupe. (Did I mention that 
I hate red cars... It's annoying that all three of my cars are red. Not my choice. :)
(At least they're better than Motor Trend - I wouldn't let my cats poop on that 
rag.)

>To be fair, I just had a Ferrari 355 and it's the first modern Ferrari I
>really like. It didn't come off as a kit car at all. Reliability, who knows?

My good friend recently sold one of his two Ferrari Dinos, a '72 U.S. spec GT. 
He'd owned the car for fifteen years and it never broke down on him. Neither 
has his other Dino. (He also had a 911 that he drove all years long - used to piss 
off the PCA folks by driving it in the winter - it was the only car he had at the 
time. He eventually sold it with over 300K miles, and it was in very good 
condition, to help finance the second Dino.)
Ferraris (with the possible except of the insane-fast ones like the F40, 288GTO, 
etc) are as reliable as most cars, as long as they're maintained well.

Anyways, that is SO far off the point as to be a total waste. But let's do a quick 
comparo - 911 Turbo vs Diablo VT.  Both have AWD. Lambo is mid-engined, 
ensuring smoother handling. The Porsche has a twin-turbo 3.6l 6-cylinder 
motor. The Lambo has a normally-aspirated 5.7l 12-cylinder. The Porsche tops 
out at 181, the Lambo has been proven to go over 200mph.

We'll have to wait for the test times to see how the 911 Turbo fares under "real" 
testing.

(If you have flames, anyone, let's try to keep them intelligent, no "you're crazy, 
you're wrong, you're stupid". If you can, prove me wrong. If not... Well, you 
know. :)

I'm surprised to hear you say that. I'm 6'2" or 3" (dunno for sure :), and my 914

That was one of the things that amazed me most about the car. Legroom could be

A Viper can't beat a Diablo, either - Viper vs 911 Turbo would be a good race. Down 
low, the Viper's incredible torque should win...

Of course, I'd much rather own a Viper than either of the other two. (Someday, I'll

David,

FYI the topic of stereos, amps, speakers, etc. raged here earlier.  Check 
the archives arount the beginning of Feb. 1995 if you want to learn more.  
Stan was right when he said that you will have difficulty hearing a system 
over the road/engine noise in a top-less 914.  Andy Warren was also correct 
is recommending an amp.  A solid amp is your best first defense for 
overcoming noise.  I would like to add, however, that it IS important to 
purchase a good amp.  It need not be "competition level equipment", and a 
moderate power level will be adequate, but a cheap, poor-built amp will do 
more harm than good.  Andy is also correct to some degree that after a 
certain price range, you will enter diminishing returns with respect to 
overcoming noise.  You might be surprised, however, at how quickly you can 
drop $1000 into car stero.

Subject: '86 928S Six Month Report (LONG)


For the members, patrons, readers, and the archives... I humbly present 
this, my 6 month recap of owning my first Porsche.

In August of 1994 I came to grips with a three year sport-utility induced 
absence of a sportscar in my life. I assessed my options and began the 
search for a Porsche 944. In doing my research, I stumbled across this list 
and various other sources of information (magazines, etc).

I quickly came to the opinion that the 944 would require significantly more 
maintenance than I was interested in (flames to /dev/null; it's *my* 
opinion). This, combined with the unexpected values to be had in the mid to 
late 80's 928 models sent my search in another direction. I'd always loved 
the styling of the 928.

My search here in Dallas was fairly difficult. Two of the three Porsche 
dealerships said that they hadn't seen used 928's in a "long time". 
Surprisingly, the third dealer had THREE; an '84, an '86, and an '89. I 
went and drove all three. In addition, I viewed a few private-sale cars. 
Nothing there worth buying or even pre-purchasing, unfortunately, as the 
price points were significantly better.

I set my sights at this point on the '86 928S in Marine Blue Metallic at 
the only 928-possessing local dealership. I arranged an 8 hour "test drive" 
to include a non-invasive pre-purchase inspection. The car had just 44,000 
miles on it and the immediate previous owner was the wife of a local auto 
dealership owner. The pre-purchase came back very positively; very good to 
excellent mechanical condition, good to very good exterior/interior. A few 
items were noted for future exploration (water pump/timing belt by 65k, due 
for 45k major service), and a few for immediate attention (Vitron camshaft 
seals, front and back).

I consulted my insurance agent and found that my insurance would not be too 
awful on the car (ABS and alarm discounts). Somewhere in this timeframe I 
was discussing the car with an associate (soon to become my partner in a 
new firm), and he remarked "You better be careful; pretty soon you won't 
have any excuse not to buy that car..." Too true.

In the middle of September, right smack on my birthday, I went to the 
dealership to sign the papers. Interest rates on used cars weren't very 
appealing at that point (I imagine that they're not much better now), so I 
borrowed the money from myself and plunked down $18,500 for the car. At the 
time, with the given mileage, $18.5k was considered "right on" for an 
"average" condition *retail* 928S, and was just a tad lower than the asking 
price. However, the dealership corrected a few minor interior and radio 
problems, and re-dyed the leather seat exit/entry bolster on the driver's 
side which was worn. I was, and am, satisfied with the amount I paid for 
the car.

Within a week of taking possession, I put the car in for its 45k service. 
The service, including oil/filter change was around $275. I had the 
camshaft seals updated to the tune of about another $250, and had all the 
belts replaced for roughly another $150. I decided to wait on the timing 
belt/water pump replacement until about 55k (creeping up there now...).

So much for the formalities... I had the car. To me, it probably represents 
the pinnacle of a civilized performance vehicle. The engine is strong and 
willing at almost any point in its curve, and the sound it makes past 3,000 
or so rpms is sweet music. Its road manner on the highway is quiet, 
comfortable and very enjoyable, even over long periods of time. One 500+ 
mile in a day trip, done twice, proved this last point out. It cruises like 
it was on glass and holds 80mph at a steady 2400rpm.

I've had both the good and the bad "other people" Porsche experiences. 
There was the gorgeous, drop-dead blond who I formerly worked with who 
fairly gushed about how she "loved my car"; and the beer drinking jerks on 
the road who "show no mercy" when it comes to merging German metal.

When it comes to other Porsche owners, I've always been received warmly 
here on Porschephiles (except by Stan, who still thinks I should have 
bought a 911 and whose most complimentary comment was "sounds like a nice 
car- for a 928" :-), but alas, Porschephiles is not reflective of the 
Dallas Porsche landscape. The folks who bought 'em in the 80's still have 
their 911's and are either confused or perturbed by my flashing and waving. 
928 owners, however, always wave, flash, and alert me if I've not already 
alerted them of my presence. A smile and a wave is the minimum I've gotten 
from other 8 cylinder, water cooled, engine mounted where God intended 
Porsches [deliberate flame bait: tongue in cheek: I am smiling right now].

Other than the initial services, my car hasn't been to see the mechanic. It 
is now due for an oil change (5,000 miles on 20W50 synthetic) and will have 
that done shortly. I topped the oil up once, about half a quart roughly 
three weeks after its service. It has been fine since.

The car still puts a smile on my face; whether I'm driving it, washing it, 
or filling it with crappy reformulated, oxygenated, adulterated 
almost-fuel. As a "life experience", this is one that I personally rank up 
there with my big successes in life; birth, marriage, quitting my job to 
start my first company, buying my first Porsche. In my obviously shallow 
opinion, it has enriched my life far beyond what I thought an automobile 
could. This is the first vehicle I've owned that after six months of 
ownership I'm really not thinking about what I want next; I'm just looking 
forward to the next time I'll drive it.

Having re-arranged my home situation to accomodate seperate feline/Porsche 
accomodations (yes, I was the one who inccocently started the cats/Porsche 
thread- no additional follow-ups necessary), everything is well in the 
Schoepp household. My wife of five years (another of my successes- hope she 
thinks so too) loves to ride in the car; a little less enthusiastic on 
driving it, but she's done a little of that too.

It has grown late while I've been composing, so I apologize if this has 
been a tad bit rambling torwards the end. To sum it all up, and 
to shamelessly quote Stan...

My experience with this kind of problem is that the shift knob buzzes like a
vibrator (female readers should not try this, for fear of losing control.)

Your dealer is probably right.

The proper alignment at TDC on #1 Cylinder is shown in a diagram that Jim
Pasha included in one of his articles on 944 timing belts in Excellence
around June or July 1994.

Usually, the misalignment occurs when the water pump is replaced or when the
balance shaft seals are replaced.

Good luck

Possible, but chances are you will break the 924 hatch when you drill the
holes for the spoiler.

Not by design, but some glass has separate from the frame. Generally not
separately available.

Probably not.

Yep, they are heavy, and cumbersome to hold.

Yep, lexan replacements, not including frame, are about 700 dollars US.

You didn't say what year your car is.

If it is 1985/2 or later (aluminum control arms) I would keep a close eye on
them.

Even the non-lowered cars wear out their ball joints.

As you suggest, you have the classic symptom (in a MPC FI car) of an air
leak. I'm not familiar with the propane torch approach to finding it, but
some common leakage spots you may want to check are the pressure sensor
(remove the hose and suck on it- any air flow at all constitutes a leak)
and the fuel injector seals. Temporarily disconnect and plug all of the
"unnecessary" things you can (you already did this for the aux. air valve).
The "suck on it" method also works for checking other things you may not
want to disconnect, like the vacuum advance diaphram.

For a tight space, try out a Camaro... or better yet a Miata! Me, at
5'10-11", with the seat all the way down, the windshield top blocks my view,
but if I put it all the way up :) I can just live without the top up here in
cold, rainy New Jersey... :(

Now, for the Porsche related bit (!), the 914 fitting certain 6 footers
while not letting others in can be explained like this: you are basically
two parts, top and bottom. If you are mostly top, clearly you won't fit into
most cars, but if you are mostly bottom, you'll fit into nearly anything.

My most humble apologies to Kevin re urban legend comment.

Maybe I'm naive, but I don't think a manufacturer in the
U.S. could get away with selling their rejects to a 
discount chain without getting sued. This all started with
Bosch plugs, and I think we can reasonably expect the spark
plugs we buy to be the same whether we buy them from the dealer,
a car parts store, or K-Mart. The fact that the new style Bosch
plugs sometimes fail is independent of where they are purchased.

Subject: 911 Alt/Charge/Battery Light

I posted a dumb question before, and I think I'll add to it.

Does anyone have a feel for how the charging system on a '87 911 works?  I
posted earlier that my battery light was starting to illuminate at night when
my headlights are on...  The brightness is still increasing.  The brightness
is also related to engine RPM in that as RPM increase, so does brightness.  So
once again, what kind of problem am I facing?  Failing alternator? battery?
regulator? just wires/ground?....What is the battery light actually
indicating?  Is it the voltage difference between alt output and battery?

In all fairness, I did get a few responses last time to check the line
integrity from alt to batter and ground.  I have not yet done this.  Is there
an easy way without going thru the hassle of all but removing the alt?

Thanks.

I drove a 67 Elan (fixed head coupe) as my only car back in the late
60's, when I was young and stupid (I'm not young anymore-). This 
included work and play, snow, etc. You can drive the car with almost
anything on your feet, including heavy work boots, by using the sides
of your feet. Of course for "spirited driving" you want something narrow
enough to use the pedals right. As you note, they were (and are) 
wonderful cars. In fact they were wonderful just as Colin Chapman
made them, without flares, wide tires, etc. There were a number of
things about my 67 911S which I didn't like in comparison to the
Lotus, after the Lotus burned to the ground from a leaky fuel line :-(

True enough!! I'm *only* 6'3", but to put it in perspective, that's over
a 32" inseam. The scary part is the 30" circumference thighs that go 
with it... Anyway, I digress. I somehow fit most 911s, but have a distinct
prefernce for cabs and targas, and just can't deal with sunroof coupes
particularly if I have to wear a helmet (hi Ken!). I also manage to
fit 914s, but if I have to wear a helmet, have to either take the top
off, or use my custom racing seat (which basicly puts my butt directly
on the floor). Other P-cars, well, typically fine if there's no sunroof.

          For all of those interested in getting some FACTS on oil
          additives (and have WWW access) this site is an almost
          religious experience!  I spent over 2 hours after work
          yesterday just reading up on scientifically based car stuff.

          What did it say?
          Oil Additives are for the most part crap (but we already
          knew that).  For the most part it is OK to mix dino and
          synthetic oil -- just make sure to use oil with the same
          rating (i.e. mix SG with SG, not with SE).  All those ads
          that show engines running w/o oil are true... its just that
          if you use the oil additive first there is MORE cyclinder
          wear than in you just use regular oil and drain it (feel
          free to try this at home.

          And now a questiion for the P-man STAN:
          Stan... a while back you said that 914s should run on
          straight 30 weight oil (correct me if I'm wrong) but I plan
          on running a pure synthetic.  Amsoil has a straight weight
          but they say it is for diesel engines.  I did notice that it
          had an SG rating in addition to a C? rating (S=spark
          ignition, C=compression ignition for those out there who
          care).  Would this be a good straight grade to use in the
          914 when the engine is rebuilt?  Do you have any better
          recommendations?  Is the benefit over multi-weight Mobil 1
          worth the effort? 

          One more tasty tidbit from the "oil web site":  Mobil 1 and
          Amsoil use completely different formulations for their
          lubrication base.  Get to the web site and find out!

It's (FINALLY) that time of year when my beast awakes from hibernation.  
It has been stored in my two car garage in the OmniBag for the winter 
(since Dec. 10).  The other bay was used all winter by the family 
mini-van (soon to be known as the "track support vehiclce"!)

Here' my plan for re-emergence.  I am looking for any suggestions on 
other appropriate procedures which I might not be aware of given this is 
my first hibernation.  Thanks in advance!

1.  Roll car out of OmniBag into driveway.

2.  Replace battery (stored in basement for winter on wood blocks);  will 
I need a re-charge for certain?

3.  Change oil and filter. (No flames please but this did not get done 
before storage as winter descended unexpectedly);

4.  Hose out garage (salt/sand in other bay);

5.  Zymol car (first time so use cleanser, then wax);  Which kind do I 
use for a Cognac Brown car (in German rauschquarzmetallic - literal 
translation "smoked quartz")?

6.  Lower air pressure in tires to running pressures (Dunlop D40's).  Any 
suggestions on best pressures or should I just go with the manual?

7.  Put protectant on rubber/vinyl parts (403)

8.  Hide Food all leather (seats, door panels etc.)

9.  Start car and allow to idle (for howe long?) to listen for any problems.

10.  DRIVE IT!

I had roughly the same problem, which eventually got to the point
that the clutch pedal wouldn't come back up at all on cold days.
I convinced myself that it was the clutch master cylinder,
because I didn't seem to be losing any fluid, but I ended up
changing the slave cylinder also before the problem was fully
corrected. The slave cylinder is easy - just get under the car
and there it is - but the master cylinder is a pain because it
is buried behind the brake booster and master cylinder, which
have to be removed for access. Nothing needs any special skill
or special tools, just patience. Got both parts from Zims for
about $70 each, as I recall.

None of this has anything to do with the engine not revving
over 3000 rpm, however - that sounds like another problem
altogether. There is no "clutch hydraulic pump" per se; just
a reservoir (the brake fluid reservoir), a master cylinder, a
slave cylinder, and a line connecting the two.  Pretty simple.

You could also check the condition or placement of the rubber ring which
sits under the throttle body.  If it is torn or out of place you will not
get a decent seal.  Or, maybe the screws holding the throttle body down
are not tight as the seal is compressed over the years.

You could also check that the vacuum advance is not stuck on the distributor.

I don't know if this part was there on the '72, but many 914's have an
overrun valve which adds air if you lift the throttle suddenly, to improve
emissions.  If it's bad, it could be letting air through constantly.  Plug
all three hoses and try the car without it.  I think Haynes lists the way
to test the valve also.

A friend's father in college had a 72 Dino from Italy, and to paraphrase from the owner's manual (I am paraphrasing because it was in Italian and I don't read or speak Italian but he did) under starting the engine in cold conditions "... If the engine doesn't start after three attempts wait until later ..."  His never broke down either, but he only put about 2,000 miles a year on it and still had it tuned frequently.

Unfair ?  If you consider past history I don't think so, If you pretend that there is no Italian car reliability history I see how you would think it unfair.  I do have more than one data point on Ferrais but this one had the best anecdote.  The same goes for Alfa's, those stories of them spontaneously igniting on the showroom floor are not all legend (flames no, smoldering yes).  My neighbor put his mechanic's children through college keeping his Alfa going, technically it never broke down (except that brake booster failure that sucked all the master cylinder fluid through the engine, but it kept running) but was well cared for (and often). I don't know anyone who has owned a Lamborghini but I'm going to call this interpolation rather then extrapolation :)

Me neither.
I spent ten days in a Lamborghini truck on One Lap of America. I used to

Depends on what you call honest. I don't consider doing your best possible
run, and then taking off a few more tenths of a second for "atmospheric
correction" to be honest. What it runs is what it runs.
 
>They do use a high-speed test track, and a fifth wheel at all times - which

If they use the Honda test track in Ohio (formerly Transportation Research
Center) they will run out of straight before they hit 202 mph or whatever.
You need several miles to get up to that. I forget if TRC is 2.5 or 5 or
whatever, but even a 2-mile straight isn't enough for a car like this.
 
As for test equipment, before you dare say anything, you should be aware
that 1) I use a "fifth wheel" too; 2) I use exactly the same "fifth wheel"
system as C/D; 3) I bought mine years before, and have used it longer than
they have; 4) it's not a wheel at all, it's a German non-contact optical
device; and 5) yes, it was on the 1990 Turbo I tested in France.
 
>If you can, prove me wrong...
 
If you would like, I can fax you copies of the device printouts for that
test. I no longer have the ASCII files stored in device memory for those runs
or I would upload that directly. If you need a witness, somebody who lurks
on P'philes was present but I don't think he's active on the list anymore.
 
And re your next post, wanting a Viper, geez, Kyle, I wouldn't even wish
that piece of shit on T*d. Have you ever driven one? If not, suggest you do so.
Rent one for a weekend and try to live with it. Then return it, and think of
all the money you'll save by no longer lusting for one. I have a lot of
respect for Chrysler's new products, every one except this thing. If Motor
Trend is something you put under the dog, then the Viper is something you
put on top of Motor Trend. The automotive press goes gaga for the Viper
because it's politically correct to do so. But it's poorly designed, poorly
built, using cheap materials slapped together kit-car style. I have driven
them twice now. They overheat (barfed coolant just following a ZR-1 on
mountain road), the panels don't fit (doors rubbed against fenders when
opened), the instrument panel is just plain stupid, the welds on the frame
look like they were done by vocational school students on their first day of
stick welding, etc. What the Viper does have is a good engine/drivetrain,
quick steering and great grip. It doesn't have any brakes.

To the list.....

I'm looking for several items and was wondering if anyone might be able 
to give me a hand on locating them. All of these items are for a 1968 
911L:

Horns grills. These are a different size then the '69 and on (?) The 
ones that I have are chrome and are pitted. The local re-chroming 
outfit says that they cannot be rechromed due to the grills being to 
close together to get their wheel (?) into to sand and remove the 
flaking off chrome.

Taillight. I need one passengers side assembly. U.S. style.

Thanks

Other than the obvious widebody kit, what else comes with
the turbo-look option package. I remember it being about $8K,
but that's it.

I plan on going to look at a '86 T-look and have no idea what
else to expect it to have.

Was there such a thing as a factory widebody in the

Subject: Re:  928 Clutch Problem


I don't understand the context for the 3000 rpm problem, so
I don't think that I can help there.

I did however have a similar clutch problem on german iron
(not a nine two eight however) that turned out to be a cracked
pressure plate (cracked all the way through the face).  It
also had a tendancy to make it difficult at times to get in gear
without an effort and/or a clunk, but this was not consistent.

Because of the crack, the pressure plate did not fully clear
the clutch disk when the pedal was depressed.  It also left
the pedal feeling spongey.  I chased the hydraulic route too
before I ended up yanking the trans.

Here's to hoping I am wrong,

Subject: WOW!!

Yes, I am the guy who instigated the whole Toyota v. Porsche thread.
A couple of day ago, I went to a shop to try a 1991 MR2Turbo, the dealer 
said that he lent it out to someone else.  So, he said we could drive 
over to where it was, the car we took...a 1978 Porsche 911SC Targa, with 
340,000 mile (1 owner).  As I was driving it, I kept thinking "what will 
the MR2 look like after 340,000 miles.  Although the Targa was pretty 
beat up, the engine still seemed fairly strong.  The MR2 was pretty beat 
up as well with only 66,000 miles only.  I first drove the MR2, I wasn't 
too happy with the turbo, it kind of sneaks up on you.  I felt really 
confident in the corners,like I was on rails.  However, at 80 the car 
started to vibrate, I don't think this is indicative of the model, the 
dealer said that it needed new tires.  I was skeptical.  I then asked to 
drive the 911 on the same route I took in the MR2.  As I said before,, 
itw as pretty beat up, but I LOVED it.  There was something special about 
downshifting into 2nd at 50 mph and blowing past a car doing 50 on the 
freeway.  The next thing I knew, I was doing 90, I told the dealer I 
thought the speedometer was broken, he just smiled.  In corners, although 
I wasn't as confident into the corner, as I was with the MR2, coming out 
of it was just amzing.  I can't wait to drive a 911 that is actually "in 
shape."  I think the next few weeks are going to be fun!!

George Hussey said "Please don't damage your museum piece 914-6 in stock

Sorry George, but this is exactly what the car should be used for.
Keeping it in a garage would be idiotic. There are plenty of
914/6's around, and if it gets trashed, so what??? Take the serial
numbers and good stuff and clone it on a 914/4 shell. Otherwise
George's 914 information has been great.

In Connecticut, we have guys racing a 911 SC/RS (one of 50 or so made
for rallying/racing, worth about 10 times that of a GOOD 914/6),
911 Carrera RS, Rare '72 factory 911S/T vintage race car,
924 carrera (?) specials, Every turbo 911 model, 911 RS Americas,
etc etc. PCA club racing is as safe as it gets, and any Porsche
should be raced if possible. Puts character in the cars and drivers!

Jim Newton won the "Manhatten award" at the Porsche Parade in '86 (?)
in his '73 911 RS lightweight. It was the CLEANEST PORSCHE IN THE
WORLD! Every nut and bolt was replaced or refinished. You can see it
in Bruce's book "911 performance handbook".
Jim was offered more money than you could believe for it.
Then he took it out to autocrosses and race tracks!

     For what it's worth (because I am not a Porsche mechanic), when they

     gear at the end of the balance shaft was on backward. It fits either 
     way. and I guess no one usually takes it off but they said someone who 
     had worked on it before replaced it backward. It looks the same from

I don't really want to get into whose oil is better or whatever, but I just
thought that as I was getting ready to use this morning to change oil in the
Toyota Camry, I decided to compare the synthetic blends. There are two
simple ratings: Energy Conserving and Energy Conserving II (II clearly being
stricter and better). Anyways, this update must have come sometime between
1985 and 1992 as our Buick doesn't recommend II, but the Toyota does.

Slick 50 is *NOT* Energy Conserving II! As magically the engine additive
DOES make a difference, the oil itself does not. I have heard that AAA will
do oil analysis for free or a small charge (I'm a member) and I intend to
check out the numbers. Mobil 1, BTW, is Energy Conserving II... I think I'm
going to try that or Castrol Syntec today...

with expensive fixes (clutch master cylinder, slave cylinder, and a

My suggestion is to bleed the clutch first. Because it is the lowest
point in the hydraulic system and it probably does not get bled as often
as the brakes, the fluid will collect dirt and moisture. Access to the
slave cylinder is easy, just jack up the front, slide in, and locate the
bleeder valve on the slave cylinder (bolted to the clutch housing near
the starter). Then select any brake bleeding method that we have just
discussed.

Well, after all of the flaming and speculation on our part, he comes

He drove an old, beat up Porsche, and he loved it.

When you go under there, take the little rubber cap off the underside
of the clutch housing and see if there's any fluid in there. I found
brake fluid, which gave me my first clue that the slave cylinder was
shot. Better than finding oil or water, anyway. You can also look up
in there and see the position of the release arm (that links the
throwout bearing to the outside world). On an '84, it should be about
in the middle of the hole; if it is too far from there, it's time for
some clutch work. If you really want to know what the allowable
tolerance is, I can look it up in the shop manual.

The product can now be described as being used by a manufacturer, so, is it no

  It's a coupe with 23K miles. The car came with 17" alloys, but he 
  traded them for 16". I realize that the car should ride softer with 
  the 16" wheels, but  soft ride is not the reason that I'd buy a 
  Carrera.  He is asking $29K for the car. Is that a fair price?  What 
  would it cost to put some 17" alloys with tires on the car?  
  $3000.00?  Is there a market for the 16" alloys? What else about the 
  car should concern me?

 Hi David,
   Here's my solution. I called Dr. 914 and had him send me a new DIN
face plate. The original stereo is on the bench getting re-aligned. I put
in a regular Pioneer Cd head unit with 4 low level outputs. These feed a
matching 25 watt per channel amp. The "front" speakers are the factory
installed units. For the "rear" speakers I drop a set of Pioneer truck
speakers that sit on the floor. The object here is not to cut and damage
anything that was original. When this car is in storage the head unit and
the truck speakers are removed. After the original radio is renewed, it will
find it's home back in the dash for good. I have found that the motor in my 914
is pretty quite and am not able to hear it as well as my 911, and therefore
listining to the stereo doesent bother me quite as much as when driving my
911. This solution is not as pretty as it could be but I am satisfied with
the quality and volume of the sound, even while moving at freeway speeds.

Have fun!

Mike,

I agree with what you said about racing Porsches and not letting them become
garage rats.  What I don't agree with is the idea of transfering the serial
numbers, etc to a 914/4 if your rare 914/6 gets trashed. This is dishones, 
unethical, and I might add, illegal.  There have been cases where a cloned
car was sold as a rare 914/6 and the new owner took legal action upon discovery
of the scam.  Trust me, it is quite easy to determine if a car has been cloned!

I used to wonder about this phenomenon.  For years, I bought SEARS Kenmore
appliances to install myself, and the "urban legend" was that they were made
by Westinghouse or some other reputable appliance manufacturer, but this
never made much sense to me because I could not see them with a) a terrible
quality control problem, nor b) a separate production line for the junk that
Sears turned out.

I concluded that Kenmore may have been made abroad (Mexico, or some such).  Co
uld a similar situation be the case for auto parts as well?

Reid says, "When I worked for Amoco, even our own employees who saw the oil
canned for discount stores (out of the same  barrel as the good stuff)
wouldn't buy their oil at K-Mart - I have to admit, even me!"

The same goes for gasoline, with a caveat or two.  If you trail the
common-carrier tankers filling up the underground tanks at your favorite
"no-name" service station or convenient mart, you'll usually find them
loading at the same terminals that supply the name-brand stations.  And, even
if the terminal is a "no-name" one, it probably gets its stock from the same
refineries supplying the name-brands.  In short, gasoline is gasoline, and it
has very little to do with brands.  The caveats?  Gasoline is refined from
oil pumped from different fields, and the quality of the crude varies
depending upon those fields.  For example, for years a well-known major brand
had such high sulfur content in all its petroleum products that heavy
equipment manufacturers specifically recommended that its diesel fuel not be
used in their engines.  It quickly clogged the injectors.  The second caveat
concerns brand-specific additives; if these appeal to you (and some are
worthwhile, unlike most after-market additives), then buy that brand.  You
may get the same additives by buying at the convenient mart, but, then again,
you may not (though you'll probably get a competitor's)!

p.s.  Perhaps a third caveat should be to avoid filling up at places that
don't stick their tanks for water regularly (and pump it out when it reaches
an unacceptable level).  Water and rust scale at $1.20/gallon is expensive
(in more ways than one).

Greetings:

This thread brings to mind a story I heard years ago regarding Ferry
Porsche's visit to the Parade in Monterey.  (The year escapes me but perhaps
mid 70's?)  Part of the planned itinerary for Dr. Porsche was a visit to
Harrah's Museum in Reno.  During the tour, which was conducted by Bill Harrah
hisself,  Harrah apologized to Dr. Porsche for not having a Porsche in the
Museum.  (I think the closest thing they had was a VW beatle of some sort.)
 Without skipping a beat or batting an eye, Dr. Porsche said to Harrah that
no apologies were necessary.  His cars were meant to be driven, not locked
away in museums.
I have gotten a lot of mileage out of this story as I use it every time
someone chides me for racing my original (well....mostly) 914-6 in drivers

Subject: How I Spent My Spring Break, by Nate Nagel

    Well, well, well, it's that time of year again, when a young man's
fancy turns to thoughts of... love? well, maybe. nice crisp apexes? 
maybe.  Brake jobs?  definitely.
    Day 1.  I get home.  914 is out of gas.  Mom took car and left.  I
putter around with some electrical work that I'd been putting off.  Soak
down all fasteners with WD-40 and Liquid Wrech, alternately.
    Day 2.  Got gas, brought 914 down to garage, put up on blocks.  Mom
and dad took me out to dinner.  Very cool.  I was up until about
midnight because I just started messing with stuff and it was all coming
apart very nicely.  By the time I went to bed I had the front end
stripped down to the spindles, rotors cleaned and painted with black
engine paint, new bearings in and packed with Redline (very cool-looking
stuff, IMHO) and rotors reinstalled.  Went to bed happy.
    Day 3.  Started on rear.  Was just going to loosen bleeder screws
and drain the fluid, then put the new master cylinder in.  Two screws
will not come out, some moron had stripped them and then left them. 
Grr.  Start on MC.  It comes off OK, all except the LF brake line.  More
on that later.  Spend all day quite unproductively.
    Day 4.  Get pissed off.  Break a bleeder screw.  Swear a lot. 
Realize I need a 19mm wrench (not socket, which I have) to get rear
calipers off.  Make a speed run to Sears.  Pick up 11mm flare nut wrench
also.  Try this on the brake line that's stuck at the MC.  Fitting
finally breaks free but is spinning the brake line with it.  Spend
several hours trying to break it free before I give up and break it off.
 New wrench does not help getting rear caliper off, bolts are too damn
tight.  Put in new MC, kludge together a fitting to get it working
without LF caliper (remember, it's gotta be out of Mom's garage before I
leave!)  Front brakes won't bleed.  Why????
    Day 5.  Remove master cylinder, drag out old, rusty, leaky one,
compare parts.  They're exactly the forking same!  I put the old parts
in the new master cylinder.  This seems to work OK.  I try to put the
new parts back in.  The seals have all swelled!  Argh!  I pry them in,
very carefully, with a small screwdriver, and try it again.  No go.  I
put in the old parts from the replacement master cylinder (before I
rebuilt it) and THEY don't work either.  The only ones that do work are
the ones that were in the car.  Curiouser and curiouser.  I put it all
together, try to put it in, get frustrated by the reservoir lines.  Go
to bed.
    Day 6.  Connect reservoir lines.  Have mom help me bleed brakes. 
She seems unimpressed by her first seat time in a p-car.  So car now has
1 front + a little help from the back brakes.  Enough to get it to the
barn, I figure.  Hose out garage, which looks like a war zone.  Sigh
with relief.  Back to school.

Moral of the story:

    Always use anti-seize on all brake parts.  If I buy a car from you
and find you have not, I will be very unhappy.  Not very obvious but
probably a good idea would be to use it on the fittings of the hard
lines - not necessarily on the threads, but on the line itself, where
the nut slides over it.  If you want to do a brake job on a 914, you
will need a 19mm wrench and a 11mm flare nut wrench, in addition to the
usual assortment o'stuff (I think a 13mm wrench, 19mm socket, and 17mm
socket, off the top of my head.  Oh yeah, and a 7mm wrench for the
bleeder screws.)
    Whoever said to connect the reservior lines before tightening down
the master cylinder was right.  It looks like the hard way.  Actually,
it is the hard way.  But it's easier than the impossible way.

Questions still unanswered:

    Why did my various master cylinders work/not work, when their parts
were identical?
    How do I get my rear caliper off so's to drill out the bleeder screw
that I broke off in a fit of pique?
    And finally, if any of you guys who are disassembling 914's could
shoot me that little teeny hard line for the left front caliper that
comes right out of the master cylinder, I would be greatly obliged.

    Oh yeah, one last tech tip.  After I got my car back in the barn, I
forget why I had to go out but I passed by the local foreign car garage.
 I went in for a chat about where to go to get the rockers replaced and
to see if he had any bleeder screws.  He had some VW ones that looked
the same, but were BRASS!  Oh, Stimpy!  Wish someone had used those on
my car before...

happy wrenching,

Nate

Jeff,

I have a 1990 C4 and dealer is right about the system needing to reset itself 
after disconnecting the battery, but according my owner's manual, the car 
will reset itself if you run the car for about 5 or 10 minutes.  I regretably 
cannot drive my C4 often enough and therefore I have installed a battery 
cutoff switch to disconnect my battery whenever I don't expect to drive it 
for awhile.  Everytime I connect my battery, the only thing "I" have to do 
reset anything is my clock and my radio--period.  My airbag light goes off 
after a couple of minutes upon starting the car up

My 1991 cars have a different system than my 1990.

This is true, I would certainly be pissed off if I found out that my
914/6 was not original. But I thought there was no difference
if you did it right, as the bodies were made on the same lines
before the sixer was sent to the Porsche factory. I think the cases
you mentioned were "fakes" rather than "rebodies". That is a big
difference and illegal.

However, my mind thinks mostly in terms of racing- I only care
about what is legal in racing (in real life we should try to bend
the rules as much as possible and beat the system, but in
racing it sucks to be disqualified). So for racing there would
be no problem in re-bodying a car like this. You wouldn't
even need the serial numbers, only the right specs.

hi p-nuts,

Pete, I don't know what was in those books but.....

Picked up a copy of the May issue of Excellence and found an ad for a 
1959 356A Coupe in need of restoration, asking $5500 US - located in Canada.

I've been in touch with the owner and:

 - fairly solid body other than floor which has been cut out
 - has replacement sheet for floor, rockers
 - has been sitting for 3 years, since bought (i.e. undriven by current owner)
 - he occasionally turns the engine which is out of the car
 - interior okay (has replacement carpets and other trim/stuff)
 - has "new" (last owner, i.e. sittin 3yr) tires, brakes
 - was robins' egg blue - currently black
 - other new bits and pieces picked up on visits to swap meets in US etc.

Ok folks, talk to me.  Opinions about price/work required for this bird? 
I realize that I've not given you much to go on.  Assuming that the rest
of the body is as solid as he claims, the floor doesn't scare me tooooo
much - should it?  Is this price about right for the stated condition and
yr and model?  I know...  I just want some second opinions here.  I've
been looking and listening for so long I don't want to get too blinded by
this perhaps good opportunity.

I've been thinking about what I'm going to do when I get my transmission
finished on my '83 928S. I'm 6'-2" with 32" inseam, so a lot of my height
is in my back. I've been lusting for that extra 2" I can see when the
sunroof is open. I've even asked Porsche dismantlers how much a 
non-sunroof roof would cost. Have not removed the driver's seat to see if
it can be lowered. Will try restuffing the seat cushion before chopping
the roof. Is there a clean, reversable way to plug the sunroof, reline
the interior, and get back some of that room?

        This sounds as if it might be one of the zinc (?) compounds mentioned
in the Snake Oil FAQ.  (Which you might want to look at again.)  There are
disadvantages to very high levels of these compounds in your oil.  They were
either more ash left when the oil burned, or more plug fouling.  (Sorry, it's
been a while since I re-read the FAQ.)  Most oil companies put some level of
these compounds in their oil already.  They generally don't come into play
until there's actual metal-to-metal contact, which hopefully never occurs.
        Then again, it might be some other type of stuff.  The claims, how-
ever, sound basically identical to what Slick-50 used to say.  And just
because the government uses something dosen't make it right for your car.

Geeze. OK, guys, this is Business 301 -- Private Label Merchandise.

Vendor X has manufacturing capability for 100,000 units of Item Y per
month. They have retail capacity for moving 65,000 units per month.
Cost per unit is relative tothe total number made. Margin per unit is 
thus higher if they can make that extra 25,000 units a month.

Enter Vendor W, who has zero manufacturing capability, but has some
product specs. For a nominal line conversion fee, Vendor X is able to
make 25,000 units of Item Y++, nearly Item Y but to Vendor W's spec
*INCLUDING* having the Vendor W name plate on it.

Vendor W now makes money because they know in advance what it's going to
cost them per unit -- there are no labor or materials fluctuations that
can screw up their planning. Vendor X makes money because they now have
higher margins on their core Item Y product because the plant is now at
full capacity. If the management team is on the ball, they also make  a
nickle or two by actually making the units for Vendor W, *PLUS* can make
a few more nickels by figuring out how to cut production costs (provided
that Vendor W hasn't got nasties in the contract that might cost Vendor X
money if the quality slips any).

And so it goes with any generic product, any store-label product, or for
that matter, any high-demand product that a vendor might want to make sure
they have a second source readily available for.

No "seconds" bins that go to K-Mart. No "Made in the People Republic
of Vergaak" mystery parts. Just good, simple business practices.

You can walk up to any PEP Boys, Hi-Lo, etc. and for that matter practically
any K-Mart, Target, Seven-Eleven, etc and buy several synthetic oils:
Mobil 1, Syntec, Valvoline Synthetic. 

To buy Amsoil or Red Line, you have to (a) want to (i.e. you won't do it
by accident because you grabbed the wrong stuff at Walmart), (b) go to 
someplace special that actually sells it, and (c) spend more money.

On the other hand, years ago, if you wanted a synthetic, you *HAD* to
look up your Amsoil or Red Line dealer...

I see it as a personal choice. I actually use the Red Line 50W Racing
synthetic in a few particular applications. It's good stuff. There are
no other single grade synthetics out there.

You *CAN* hack the seat mounts. I've done that on a couple of 911s now
to get the head room I wanted. I forget who clued me in on that --
Steve Tynor? someone, on this list, a *LONG* time ago... Hacking the

Club Racing has a 13/13 rule -- if you bend anything, you're on suspension
for 13 months; if during that time you repeat, you're *OUT* for 13 months.
As a result, it's pretty safe relative to SCCA racing. Kevin -- any recent

Working on metal under the seat WOULD be more acceptable than working

Hey, thought I'd ask as there is no telling what creative Porschephiles

pressure in my tires, 2) longer springs at the wheels, 3) taller and 
narrower tires, 4) enlarge the sunroof opening so my head sticks thru?
5) convert it to a WSC car?

Ouch. But I fear right to the point. I've been finding more and more threads 
on <interesting> topics like three wheelers vs. four wheelers etc... Stan, 
would you like me to write an A.I. program to filter out such discussions 
that belong on 'The Porch Enquirer'?

One discussion that got off to a 'bad start' ended well. I found useful the 
conclusion to the 'Add junk to your oil thread'. I admit I was getting 
confused with all the noise in print, TV, radio advertising about 'Sleek-50' 
and others, and considered buying some a few weeks ago. After all, Teflon is 
great when I'm cooking an omelette, so why not throw some in my Porsche (the 
Teflon, not the eggs stupid). The gentleman that started the discussion had 
a valid question in light of all the confusion out there. The later mention 
of Porsche's own R&D trying out these products anyway was so logical (and 
conclusive IMHO) that I will pull that reminder from my back pocket next 
time I see an ad. for 'Helium-01 Ultralight Tire Inflater Addictive'. (Don't 
you get any bright ideas now!)

Of course it normally be difficult to write such an A.I. program but since 
the level of intelligent in some of these threads is so low, all I have to 
do is write an A.S. filter program instead (Artificial Stupidity). Piece of 
cake actually!

Could someone point me in the direction of the F.A.Q. /thread on 'Fuel Lead 
Substitutes' for early P-cars ? Really.

you are great with your hands & have a fair stock of parts etc you will be
getting into some $$$$ for floors etc ( they NEVER just need floor panels -
closing panels, longitudinals, inner rockers, torsion area, frame struts
etc). Motor installation is easy - IF that's all that has to be done -ie no
overhaul.  By the time you get into the above, then paint, accessories,
brakes etc get the price into more than the car is worth...unless the late
80's come back when the magic formula of greed+briefcase

Barry writes, "How safe is Club Racing" (snip) "will I damage my car"

Well Barry let me put it this way... Racing is racing so in the heat of
competition and at the speeds involved shit does tend to happen. If you are
going to go racing you must have the attitude that if the shit lands on you
you had best be prepared to eat it. In other words, and this applies to a
lesser extent to Track Events, you have to be able to rationalize the fun
potential over the possible damage potential.
Certainly the emphasis is on safety and fun. I don't think anyone wants to
damage their Porsche anymore than you do. If clear heads prevail the events
are usually very safe. If the red mist appears than stuff can happen. It is
important to identify the yo yos and keep out of their way and drive within
yourself. If you take the proper attitude out on the track you will reduce
your exposure to problems.
BTW I have seen more damage at High Speed Drivers Ed than at many of the race
events.
Hope this is a help.

Well, they should not be raced for other reasons. Never mind. The (real)
Ferrari owners have the right idea (real Ferraris have V12s mounted up
front). If you trash it, you can always make a new one from a stack of sheet
metal for less than the cost of buying another one.
 
You want rare? I have a friend who owns a 550 Spyder. He wrecked it while
vintage racing. It is nearly completely rebuilt now. He'll go race it again.
550s are rare. Chevy Vegas are rare. 914/x and 356 and even 356 Carrera are
NOT rare.
 
How come people who deal with one specific model for a living seem to feel
that it's necessary to foster the idea that that model is somehow rare and
valuable? Really solid 356s cost less than a new Dodge Neon. 914/6s cost
less than a new Mustang V6 automatic. (That one only sticks in my mind
because I just returned one and we determined that my daily driver 356
out-drags it. Not even a question of out-handling it.)

Hi, David.
 
Sounds like another parts car. There are a few, very few, people who can put
new floors in professionally and do it right. The question here is how much
damage was done when a "sheet metal" floor was put in? You can do a LOT of
damage by welding it in wrong. Warp car, etc. How do doors close? How do
door gaps look?
 
Rockers are very difficult to get right. Yes, I know, repros are available.
Doesn't matter, repro is almost never as good as original, and rockers are
very difficult to get right.
 
No rust anywhere else -- where else could you get it? That's about as bad as
it gets, structurally. How about the longitudinals? They are what holds the
car together. If the floor and rockers have been replaced, chances are these
have problems too. You will need to look under the carpets. The only other
really serious structural rust area I've seen is the rear torsion bar tube.
Look under the bolted-in plate that holds the torsion bar in. If the area
under the plate is rotten, at the lowest point of this frame member, it's
another job for an expert. Other, non-structural rust: you could also check
for rust behind headlights, ahead of door hinges, along bottoms of doors,
under the battery, under gas tank, under pedal cluster.

Subject: Re: PCA Club Racing-How Safe? 

Greetings:

Are we talking about damage to Porsches, or damage to Porsche drivers?
As far as damage to the most important component of the package is concerned,
the worst I have seen is a minor cut on the hand.
Last year, Alan Friedman, (Club Racing founder, guru and statistician)
published a breakdown of incidents citing average number of incidents per
event, ratio of 1 car incidents (spinning off course and contacting something
which causes damage to the car) to car contact incidents (2 or more cars
coming together causing car damage).  If you call him at 703/620-9268 I'm
sure he will share this information with you.  This was published in the
quarterly publication "PCA Club Racing News".  Perhaps someone on this list
can dig out that copy and post the stats.  The numbers were very low and as
Jerry said, most were caused by either judgement error or brain fade.

We have sanctions available to us which we impose when necessary, and
although some may disagree, we do *not* enfoy imposing them.
The 13/13 rule Stan mentioned is used in incidents resulting in car damage.
 If a person "creates" an incident resulting in car damage, after a thorough
review of the situation with as many eyewitness reports as possible, the
"creator" is placed on a 13 month probation period.  If a driver creates
another incident within this 13 month probation period, he is placed on a 13
month suspension.  The 13 month probation period does not place any
restrictions on the driver, it is just a hammer hanging over his/her head,
waiting to drop if it happens again.
Even this is not cast in bronze.  We have had a couple of situations which
caused the Chief Steward to place a driver on suspension as the result of the
1st incident.
These sanctions are used to try to keep this program as safe as it can
possibly be in the context of wheel to wheel racing.  Your concerns echo
those of the majority of people pondering involvement in this fine program.
To date I have raced in 8  events (yes, in my 914-6) and served as Chief
Steward at 10 more and I have made the following observations.
1.  The only incident I recall created by verifiable mechanical failure (not
a sanctionable offense) was a tire blowing on a 935 at Road Atlanta in 1993.
 This happened on the back straight (straight?) and the car made an abrupt
left turn at very high speed taking out about 50 feet of chain link fence.
 The damage to the car was mostly cosmetic and the driver was fine.
2.  The majority of the car to car incidents occur in the higher classes.
I.E. modified or purpose built race cars.  Very seldom do you see a car to
car in the stock or improved classes.  I feel the reason for this is that
these people (myself included) are more intimated by the possibility of
damaging their equipment, therefore treat each other and their cars with a
tiny bit more respect.  That is they give each other a little more room and
perhaps drive at 9.9 instead of 10.1
3. *Most*  incidents are "created " by drivers with "middle level" racing
experience. (2-3 years perhaps).  Why?  My feeling is that beginning racers
tend to be very conservative and not take unecessary chances in questionable
passing situations and very experienced racers know enough not to try a pass
if it won't work.  (they also get to know very quickly who they can race
closely with and who they can't).
4.  The general attitude of drivers in PCA Club Racing is one of camaraderie
and fellowship.  They are all there to have a great racing experience in cars
which, for the most part, cannot be wheel to wheel raced in any other venue.
As Jerry said, I have seen as much car damage in high speed drivers ed events
as I have in PCA Club Racing.  If you like drivers ed you will *love* club
racing.  It adds a whole new dimension to the Porsche driving experience.
Incidently, to apply for a Club Racing license you must have completed at
least 8 days of verifiable drivers ed. (Track not auto-x)
The rule book and license app may be obtained by calling Ruth Harte at the
PCA National office (703/922-9300) and requesting one.
If you still have doubts, make arrangements to go see one in person and I
think you will be impressed by the quality of driving, the array of cars and
the great time everyone is having with their p-cars.  Do this at your own
risk, however, this is an addictive thing you could easily become caught up
in.

Sorry for the length of this, but I feel it needed to be said.  Barry isn't
the only one with this question on his mind, he's just the only one who's
asked.

I'm not Dora, (a pre-war classic with a pre-war husband), who doesn't do

Since no good deed should go unpunished, I'm going to inflict Snake's tale
on you in retal... er, appreciation of your day-brightener.

You do know the difference between a War Story and a Fairy Tale, don't you?

Fairy Tales start with:  "Once upon a time"; while War Stories start with:
"Now this is no shit..."

     [ The captain has now turned on the No-Shit Light: ]

Now this is no shit, it really happened to me (no shit, it really did!) a
few years ago, when I lived in Saigon (actually, it was Gia Dinh Province,
about a block before the Province Headquarters, on the road from Tan Son
Nhut airport to Highway 1, made famous by the French Writer, Bernard Fall,
as the "Street Without Joy" (Rue Sans Joie) in his excellent book by that
name).

I shared a very large, one story villa with some Vietnamese folks and a
bunch of servants.  The villa had a large, sunny atrium in its center, and
formed a large U around the atrium. A very large spacious living/dining
room room, and then my suite (Bedroom/bathroom on the right of Bedroom)
formed the left side of the U.

A very large bedroom that opened from the left side into the Living Room
space, and from the back into the Kitchen, and with a barred, glass-less
window opening into the atrium, formed the bottom of the U.

A Store-room connected to the kitchen, and several bedrooms formed the
right side of the U. The U was closed by a full height (about 14ft)
extension of the front living space wall that ran across the front of the
villa and became the forward wall of the bedroom on the right side of the
atrium.

My Bedroom was entered from Living Room space and also was connected to my
private bath; which, strangely enough, also connected directly into the
(very large) kitchen.  The Kitchen also opened into the Living Space, the
bedroom on the bottom of the U facing into the atrium, and into the store
room.

Snake (as he/she/it was better known) came into my life one night when I
was playing poker with some of my Army friends, in a group house where
about 15 of them lived.  Someone mentioned that they had a *really* big
snake for sale for $25MPC (Military Payment Certificates, supposedly
unusable except in military facilities.  Ohhhh yeah, *un*usable, sure
thing, GI... available on the open market at $2MPC to $1Green backs or,
simply, Green.  But I digress...). Short version: Snake went home with me.

Folks, there were a *lot* of *small* people living in this villa, the
Landlord had a (tiny) daughter about 6, and the house-amah had a youngster
about the same age and size.  There were also assorted young girls ranging
in age from 11 to 18 belonging either to the Landlord or the amah; and
total number of the number of people other than me, over 5 ft high was
equal to the number of them sharing my enthusiasm for ol' Snake's company.
If I had to guess, I'd estimate that number to be, oh, say... Zero or
less.

Well, because Snake had just eaten the day or so before he became a guest,
he was very lethargic from a full belly.  So since he was on his best
behavior, everyone *reluctantly* agreed to give him a chance.  Thereafter,
during the days that followed, Snake played inner-tube, spending the heat
of the days curled up inside an old truck tire out in the atrium.

Among the things I learned from living with ol' Snake, was that the old
wisdom about letting sleeping dogs lie doesn't necessarily apply ONLY to
dogs.  I also learned that it's not a real good idea to kick a tire that
has a large snake sleeping inside.  I also (accidently) learned that white
boys can, indeed, jump!  As a side note here, you'd positively be AMAZED at
how LOUD a 98 inch python can hiss, and how much HOSTILITY even a
good-humored one can interject into such a simple sound. I promise you;
it'd definitely get your attention!  It might also prompt you to change
your under-shorts sooner than you might otherwise have planned.

In the evenings, I'd occasionally take Snake with me and we'd go strafing
the bars.  Just before going in, I'd wrap ol' Snake around my waist and
stroll in and take a seat.  As anyone who's been there will recall, these
were highly cultured places where gentlemen could go and meet ladies of
refinement, and while away the hours in genteel conversation.

For those of you who've missed that uplifting experience, picture this.
Your basic bar (pretty much the same the world over, a long narrow, dark
room with a bar running along one wall), but well stocked with Ladies eager
for "Cultural Exchange."

Its not uncommon to find this kind of feminine companionship already
present in any bar in any part of the world.  In many parts of the world,
(by no means universally so, however) sharing that companionship is
optional. Not the case in Saigon.  There, to enter a bar was to be
virtually *engulfed* in a swarm of young lovelies, each greeting the
newcomer in his native tongue, with the same seductive, subtly
sophisticated greeting "Hey Joe! You ver han'some! Where you come from in
Uni' Stat?  You buy me one Saigon tea!"

[editor's note, Serious Mode: ON]  I'm not demeaning the ladies or their
culture.  They spoke a hell of a lot more English that most of us spoke
Vietnamese.  They were honest.  It was tea, at whiskey prices, true; but
they never said it was anything *but* tea!  And, to their credit, they
almost *never* were prostitutes.  It was pretty much all good, clean fun,
and (almost) everybody understood that.  [Ok, enough.  Serious Mode: OFF]

This feminine companionship, however, definitely was *not* optional.  If
you only wanted to get a beer and swap lies with your buddies without this
companionship, you had to go somewhere other than a bar.  That is, (heh,
heh...) UNLESS say, you happened to have a 98 inch python under your shirt,
and he happened to stick his head out to join the party...  Now that, my
friends, would get you some SERIOUS breathing space; and right NOW!  You
just wouldn't believe that ladies that small could move that fast.  I get
tears in my eyes just thinking about it.  (but then again, I'm notoriously
easily amused...)

But I digress again (I'm also pretty easily distracted).  Snake had been a
member in (more or less) good standing around the villa for about a year.
Every two weeks, during that period, the cook would go to the market and
buy a live, *large* white duck (10-15 lbs) for Snake (35-40 lbs). All the
residents would gather in the bedroom pressed up to the window facing the
atrium in breathless anticipation of the life and death drama to come. Once
everyone had secured an observation place, the duck would be tossed out and
introduced to Ol' Snake.  Sometimes the duck would go berserk and run
around squawking its head off, and sometimes it would stand *very* still,
trying to pretend it was an inanimate object. Either way, it became Snake's
dinner. Everyone in the house, except me (and, of course, the duck) found
this endlessly fascinating.  I watched the first time, but had no stomach
for any more. [But hey, this is the stuff of life, not *pointless*
cruelty...anyway, I'm getting to the point; keep your shirt on...]

Once Snake had suffocated the duck, he'd spend at least half an hour
checking it over thoroughly for signs of life.  Then, he'd spend about the
same amount of time fastidiously stretching the bird out in a straight
line, grasping the bill in his mouth and maneuvering around until he got it
just right.  Next, he'd maneuver himself to approach the duck nose to beak,
and start working the bird down his throat.  Pythons (hell, most all
snakes) have a mouth full of thin, inwardly-curving teeth like fish-hooks
without barbs.  It's important to know this, as once food starts down that
long journey, it's  a *one* way trip.  No returns, No cancellations!  In
fact, a number of large snakes die each year from starting to eat something
too big to swallow.  I believe that's why Ol' Snake took so long looking
the duck over before starting to eat.  Snakes have a unique perspective on
this "Don't bite off more than you can chew" business...

In those days, I used to spend about a week out of each 4 to 6 weeks, split
between Hong Kong and Bangkok.  I had one of these trips planned that would
take me away over Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, so the Vietnamese
residents planned to take advantage of my absence to celebrate a big,
traditional family feast to celebrate the holiday. No round-eyes invited.

Now Snake had been scheduled to "do the dinner thing" with a duck about 10
days prior to my departure.  But this time, when introduced to the duck,
Snake completely ignored it.  By the time for me to leave, Snake and the
duck (who had to be fed every day!) had become like old married folks.
Snake ignored the duck, and the duck had come to ignore Snake.  I was
worried about Ol' Snake's health, but none the less, I still had to leave
as scheduled. Something unexpected came up when I got to Bangkok, however,
that caused me to curtail my trip and return early to Saigon after being
away only three days of the seven I had planned.  I arrived back at the
villa about 5:00 pm the day before Tet and the planned big celebration; and
agreed to accommodate the Vietnamese folks by either leaving and staying
gone all the next day, or by keeping to my private quarters all day while
the celebration took place.  Snake, up to this point, still hadn't eaten
the duck.  My return however, must have precipitated the return of Snake's
appetite; as he forthwith commenced to make dinner out of one large, *very*
surprised, duck.

Now normally this would result in a very lethargic snake with a very large,
football shaped lump about a foot or so down from his head; and *total*
disinterest in food for at least the next week or more.  This seemingly
happy turn of events was completed just minutes before the cook arrived
with five live chickens for the next days festivities.  Seeing Ol' Snake in
his well-fed stupor, she put the chickens out in the atrium with him and
started on the other kitchen preparations.  Meanwhile, I went back to my
quarters and showered-off the accumulated grime from my day's travels.

Just after I stepped out of the shower and into my bedroom, the most
incredible, god-awfull commotion erupted.  It sounded like it started to be
a mere riot, but blossomed into utter chaos.  In a span of about 15
seconds. I mean, there's just no *way* to adequately describe the utter
pandemonium; yelling, screaming, hollering and shrieking!  It sounded like,
as a bare minimum, the Viet Cong had picked the atrium as the launch-site
for a new offensive!  Honestly concerned that something like this might be
the case, I cinched the towel around my waist, grabbed my .45 cal
grease-gun and my flack-vest, threw open the door from bathroom to the
kitchen, and dashed through and into the bedroom facing the atrium
expecting to meet the worst.

Boy and Girls, the picture these eyes beheld was the the most wondrous
sight this old soldier *ever* expects to see, even if he lives another 7
lifetimes!  Snake, it seems, had developed a *tad* more appetite than he'd
let on up to that point, and the presence of those chickens in his living
space was a temptation he never even *thought* about resisting. Before
anyone knew what he was up to, he'd snared one of the chickens and promptly
dispatched it.  The other four chickens, having been surprisingly quiet up
to that point, began getting seriously agitated, leaping up into the air,
running here and there, screeching, squawking, defecating, shedding
feathers, flapping their wings, generally disturbing the peace and
declaring the end of the world as we knew it, to be at hand.  Hoo Boy!

That was all it took to incite the entire household of small, and
surprisingly vocal, humans to riot; or at least to show their solidarity
with the chickens by emulating them, running in all directions, shrieking,
waving their arms in the air, and I don't know what-all.  Four excited
chickens, when they put their minds to it, can raise a fairly respectable
ruckus on their own.  Add in, ohhhh, say... 7 to 12 small hysterical female
persons, ranging in age from 6 to 50, each determined to out-panic and
out-shriek the others, and the chickens, too...  Now THIS was flat-out
AMUSING, not to mention FUNNY!

But I may've led you to believe that, given this delicious lunacy, the
level of pandemonium and the general level of chaos and disorder currently
reigning, things were about as amusing as they could get.  That's what I
thought anyway.  Fat chance!

Snake, calmly ignoring the live chickens and other distractions, had
started to swallow his dessert.  Did I mention that this is not a
reversible process?  I'm sure I forgot to explain that to the cook.

Seeing Snake start on HER chicken, she gave a whoop of outrage, squatted
down on the tiles and started tugging on the back half of that chicken for
all she was worth.

Snake, not appreciating this interuption of his dinner, was not very much
inclined to look favorably upon the misguided efforts of the cook to impose
this measure of dietary discipline upon him.  Neither was he inclined to
keep his displeasure to himself.  Or to give up that chicken...

In the meantime, all the other occupants of the villa; chickens, humans,
(probably a Martian or two as well, who could say?) went on, raising merry
hell. I had to put the grease-gun down, lest, in my by now hysterical
convulsions, I shoot myself; OR, (possibly worse, all things considered
under the circumstances) drop my towel!  Just about that time (all the
while thinking to my self that NOTHING could possibly be *this* funny) one
of the most-active chickens in the group, (probably the ring-leader)
expired of fright or excitement and fell to the tiles with an audible
thud.

The demise of the second chicken inspired that hysterical bunch to rise to
a truly *Olympian* level of frenzy!  And, as if that were not enough by
itself; clearly audible over even this impressive cacophony, came the angry
screams of the cook; punctuated by the answering, indignant bellows of Ol'
Snake, who, despite a mouth filled with fully half a large chicken, was
snortin' his outrage like an 18-wheeler demanding a passing lane, and
whippin' his considerable bulk around like a bull 'gator in heat.  Lord
have Mercy! The mind boggles! This was totally Surreal!  This was Bliss for
the easily amused!  Whew!!! I accidently woke Dora in the middle of the
night the other night, shaking the bed with laughter as I relived the
experience in my mind (she, on the other hand, was curiously un-amused...
maybe you had to be there). I know I'll never see or experience anything
that funny as long as I live, and believe me, it's a damn good thing; I'd
never survive another one like that!

Snake won the tug-of-war over the chicken that night, but also got his
walking (slithering?) papers at the same time. Something was said about a
unanimous concern that a couple of the smaller girls weren't much, if any,
larger than Snakes new found appetite...

According to Porsche itself, it has all Porsche key codes on file with the 
VINs from 1970 on (except 914s). So if you have a 1970 or newer 911, or 
924/944/968/928/whatever, all you need is your VIN code.

Hi Andy, 
    Your point is well taken.  I own both a '84 911 Carrera and a '95 
Ducati 900 SP.  On the same road, both have their strong points: The 
Porsche has a safety factor that the bike doesn't, combined with more grip 
at the limit; the bike owns the acceleration and transitional handling 
categories.  I have driven the 911 at 10/10th's; however, I am not the 
rider that the Ducati needs to be ridden to that degree.  It's not a 
question of "balls" (excuse me, ladies) but more of common sense 
(realizing the limits of my abilities).

    On the other hand, very few cars pass me while piloting either 
vehicle.  More bikes than cars in both cases!  Well, you have inspired me 
to do more research.  Thanks!

solid (no bondo patches or rust repairs). Being a starving student who 
wants to keep this car for a long time, how much am I going to have to 
spend to get a reasonable quality paint job? I don't need show car 
paint, but I do want a quality paint job which will still look good 10 
years down the line. I'm willing to personally do all the prep stuff I 
can to keep costs down. 
	The original color is canary yellow, and there are sections  
which have been partially resprayed, but I would much rather paint it a 
darker color (like british racing green). Do I need to get this thing 
bead blasted? Do any people in the So.Cal area have experience with paint

Subject: Moldy 911T

Dear Porschephiles,

I have just visited my '73 911T for the first time since I put it up
on jackstands last August in preparation for my year-long sabbatical
in the Netherlands. (Some of you might remember my request then for
advice on long-term storage. While I didn't take Ben's or Bart's
advice to ship my car to Europe, we did acquire a used BMW in Holland,
which has been a lot of fun to drive on the autobahn).

While it was really great to see my car again after these many months,
I was dismayed to find an amazing growth of mold in the interior. All
the vinyl upholstery is affected, but seemingly worse is the presence
of mold on the cloth inserts of the Recaro seats.

I am presently in the U.S. just for a short visit; I won't be
returning permanently to the States until August. I was hoping to
clean up the mold while I am here this week, so it is not an even
bigger job next summer. What is the recommended procedure for mold
removal? Any suggestions for keeping the interior mold-free for the
next few months? The car is stored in an unheated garage. Should I
keep the windows open (at least partially)? Until now the windows have
been closed.

Thanks for any help.

Cheers,

Tom

Yes, this will be a synthetic blend. True, you can't get all the oil out
without some truly intensive work. For instance, when I changed the oil in
the Toyota, using ~4 quarts of Mobil 1 and 1 quart of Castrol GTX (dino
juice). The thing you have to watch for is to match SG and SH oils (Mobil 1
is both, so you should have no problems). Once you choose a certain weight
though, you should stick with that, or else you'll get a suspension (where
one oil floats on the other), but after one or two more changes, it should
all come out anyways.

BTW, most of the 'synthetics' are actually synthetic blends. Amsoil and Mobil
1 are synthetic (100%) while Slick 50 and Exxon Synthetic are only blends.

2 quarts does sound like a high number though... are you draining ALL of the
oil?

I don't know where you got this info, but it's not correct.

In the past, there were NO good tires for 17" 911 fronts (for 
autocrossing at least). This year BFG finally has a good tire :
the 235/45 (?) /17. They have been used with success on the
new M3 (front and rear) at the pro solos this year.
This is great news for C2 and C2 RS America drivers, as well
as the 993 with the 17" rims. These should be perfect on
7" or 8" rims.

The new BFG Comp TA R1 tire (230) is designed for track
but is also used for autocrossing as the 226 compound has
been retired. This is no great loss : even though the 226 was
extremely fast, the wear was terrible and the tires would cord
in the center groove before the outer edges were worn much
at all. Added bonus : now autocrossers can do a few track
events too!

Call (800) RACE-BFG for the sizes and prices.

Subject: Parts for 1987 944S

Anybody out there is, or know of somebody who is, interested in selling a 
skid plate and a cam tensioner (Porsche part # 944 105 067 16) for an 87 944 
S ?  This tensioner is as far as I know, unique to the 87/88  944 S.  
I changed the belts and rollers on this car because the old belt (only six 
months old) had developed a warp probably due to a worn roller and was 
making some noise.  The tensioner spring appears to be weak and perhaps that 
is all that needs replacing.  I am interested in other opinions on this 
matter since the tensioner is a pretty expensive piece (dealer only part) to 
purchase.

Subject: Water leaks & sticky door triggers

Help!

My recently-purchased 1984 944 is displaying a couple of very annoying
qualities.  First of all, when I first got it there was a lot of moisture in the
back under the hatch, making the carpet damp, etc.  Didn't worry too much,
thought it was due to just collecting to much humidity when the dealer was
washing it twice a day (test driving in mucky spring weather).  But today I got
back from a 2-week trip to discover a LOT of dampness back there, completely
dampening the carpet, & soaking a Chilton's book and a whole roll of paper
towels I left back there.  Worse, I didn't notice it until my Soundstream amp
(located in with the spare tire) blew it's fuses due to all the moisture.  After
removing the carpet, there are a lot of droplets on the metal surface near the
spare tire, but nothing really collecting deep in the spare tire space or down
in sides behind the rear wheel wells.
The question is, what could be causing this?  I know for certain it accumulates
when the car's been sitting still in the rain, for a long period.  The moisture
only accumulates in the area around 6-12 inches from the back (taillights area).
It seems to be evenly on both sides (so I think it's not leaking around the
power wiper), and doesn't seem to come from the drain tubes by the hatch catches
(I made sure they're not plugged, and the dampened spots seem a bit far from
this)  The sunroof drains also seem clear and working properly.  	
I checked when it was raining today, and couldn't see any trail of water from
any seals or drains to the spots where the water seems to collect.  There was
lots of condensation on the inside of the hatch though.  The one thing I haven't
done is disassemble the hatch catches to see if the water could be somehow not
getting to the drain tubes -- but again, the pattern of wetness doesn't make it
look like it's coming from there.  ANY ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GREATLY
APPRECIATED!!!!!  (in other words, it's driving me NUTS!!!)

The other question is:  How can I properly lubricate my door-handle triggers?
Since I got the car, they seem to vary between being "OK", to usually being
"very stiff", to sometimes being "squeeze-with-both-hands-and-curse-loudly".
What's stranger is their behavior doesn't seem to really correlate with how wet
or cold it is, or any other condition I can think of that should make a
difference.  I've tried oiling the parts of the triggers and lock catches that I
could get at externally with a flexible tube, but none of that seems to really
work.
Would really like to get it fixed up quick, as new handles seem to be pretty
darn pricey (about 8 to 10 times the price of Volkswagen ones I've seen
advertised, which seems silly -- are any of the parts common between the two?
My friends with a late-model Golf Cabriolet and lots of older VWs with
trigger-handles have never had problems)  ?????

Subject: need prices for rare 356/4-cam spares


	I have some spares I need to sell to help pay on some
	student loans. Unfortunately I am a little at a loss as to a
	fair price for them. If someone could make some suggestions
	as to what they might be worth I would appreciate it. I want
	to place an add in the 356 Registry mag without being
	completely out of the ball park (i.e. neither outrageously
	high nor way under priced).

	First is a set of four NOS sodium filled intake valves for
	a 4 cam Carrera motor. The ATE part number on the stem of
	the valves is 3939 and on there is also the letters EIN KO on
	the other side of the ATE symbol. They are in a Tranco box
	which has the part numbers SAS3479SF on it. This same number
	is also stamped on the valve stems just below the keeper area.
	My research based on a very old (mid sixties) Beck catalog 
	(apparently before it was Beck-Arnley) shows this to fit 
	55-59 Carrera and Spyder. I originally purchased these from
	an old import parts warehouse thinking they were Super-90
	valves but got them home and discovered the were a LOT larger
	than that. 

	The second item is a Stork oil (or OEL as it is marked :-)
	temperature gauge that has the long thermo couple that terminates
	in the dipstick which has a screw-on loop type handle. I believe
	this may be NOS also but I have no way of verifying this except
	to say that it came from a defunct Porsche importer from the
	fifties and still has steel packing bands around the coiled up
	thermo couple wire. From what I have been told this is a Pre-A
	piece of equipment. The gauge face is black with green lettering
	and a double ended green needle.

	Like I said I would appreciate some guidance as to what these
	might be worth. I am aware that Palo Alto Speedo is marketing
	a reproduction of the Stork gauge but I would think an original
	would be more desirable.

Since you indicate that the moisture is in the tailight area, could it be 
coming in from where the tailight assembly meets the body? After the body 
shop replaced one of my tailights, I noticed a bead of cauking (gorilla 
snot?) carefully lining the edge of the lights where it meets the body. I 
also noticed this on the old light before it was replaced. Maybe water is 
coming in from this seam?

Hi Jim, 
Got my new proportioning valve yesterday. It's marked 5/33. I hope that's
correct. Will install today.
Yes I am running the stock TurboS control arms. When I was at Sebring I posed
that question to the Kelly-Moss guys. They claimed to have never had a
failure of that part it 50,000 track miles which I find encouraging. They
claimed that failure was caused by using larger than normal (they didn't
define larger than normal) front sway bars. They said my 30mm bars were not a
hazard. They also claimed that excessive lowering was also contributory.
They contend that the stock TurboS springs were wimpy and should be upgraded
instead of compensating with super heavy anti roll bars.
It also seems that the ball joints should be checked regularly and replaced
when there is any signs of play. I had to do this last year. I sent my arms
to European Dynamics in Houston and they came back like new. Apparently the
ball joint unit is epoxied into the arm. With a bit of heat the epoxy softens
and they can be removed. European Dynamics then replaces the joint unit with
a heavier duty one and epoxies it back in place. They wouldn't tell me which j
oint they use but rumor has it that it is a VW truck item.
Anyway so far so good and I do check them regularly as you can imagine. What
did you hear about the Fabcar design that was negative?I was considering
going that route in the future if the ball joints failed again. After all the
factory unit is more expensive than the FabCar unless you can get deals.
Be interested in the scuttlebutt you've heard.

Subject: First day out...

Well, being the second weekend of spring weather and I had a few free
minutes, I decided to live on the risky side today... I drove the '73 911T
around the block... twice!! (Now keep in mind, this car is 'the baby' and
has no insurance, so has been living under house arrest since our last
insurance policy expired... next week, the license plates expire and it
shall be put away until... later)

I now live in (relatively) flat NJ, after moving from southern Indiana. Now,
in S. Indiana, the hills and driveways were steep, so steep in fact, that
the Porsche would roll away if not in gear (something terribly difficult to
do while it is running), because the parking brake doesn't seem to do a very
good job of keeping the car from defying gravity. I noticed this again
today... on a slight incline, I went into the house for a minute, came back
out to find the car leaving without me (which I believe is illegal in this
state :) )

Anything I should look for in trying to strengthen the parking brake, or
before I break out (no pun) Haynes, is this just a design limitation?

Another 'problem'... This is a normal problem, like if suddenly the car
stopped leaking oil... Anyways, I started the car up like usual, and like
every now and then it does, backfired. Now, the weird thing was that the
oil pressure shot up to normal, not high, not low, just smack dab in the
middle. This was at 1000 RPM (idle), and running the speed up ran the
pressure up. It was just weird that 10 seconds into the run, the pressure
was where it normally takes 15 minutes to get to. I doubt this is a problem,
but what caused it?

Well, I officially have Katarina on the road, and took her out for a 
while yesterday. I'm VERY happy to have the new heat 
exchangers - sounds like a sewing machine now, instead of a top

Below 2000rpm, it stumbles a lot when it's cold. 2000 rpm is like a 
switch - suddenly it runs smoothly.

The damn thing won't idle! Gotta check the idle adjust when it's 
warm, I turned it and turned it when it was cold, and it didn't 
seem to make any difference. The screw seemed to turn too 
easily, as well.

Oil leaks! After I drove it for a while, I could hear drip, drip, drip, 
drip onto the heat exchangers... My mechanic mentioned that it 
might be the pushrod tubes...?

Oh, and I got the street-legal H4s from Hella (they're called Hella 
Vision Pluses, and they claim they use HB2 headlights, but don't 
let that fool you - they're real H4s), turned 'em on at night, and 
the wire behind the headlight switch started to burn up, causing a 
most unpleasant cloud of smoke from behind the instrument 
panel. So I had to drive home with running lights only... Yuck.

But it's still nice to be "back in the saddle" again. :)

If the car is sold as all original, I would agree with you.  But remember,
the factory sold replacement bodies; all you had to do was supply the serial
number of a wrecked car, and presto, new car. The part numbers are in old 914
parts manuals.  My brother in law had a 911 at one point that had a '71
title, but had been rebodied with a '78 chassis.  The factory sold them
either as a body in primer or complete painted bodies with all interior trim,
wiring, etc., less seats, drivetrain, and suspension. If the conversion is
complete, ie., all special bits, mounts, brackets, who cares?
Porsche certainly didn't! :)

Depending on your dealer, you probably can - the problem is proving proof 
of ownership, though they may not even bother checking. The problem is 
it'd be easy for someone to see your car, look at the reg. sticker and copy 
down the VIN, and get a set of keys made for it. Mercedes is getting pretty 
picky about this now, you can understand the danger!

Anyways, we ship out keys all the time, so shipping them isn't a problem - 
you should be able to give them a c.c. # and be all set.

Subject: 914-4 valve adjustment problems

I have a slight problem.  My '72 914-4 is just about ready to go back on 
the road with  the finishing touches being made to the body (pre-paint) 
and engine.  I completely rebuilt the engine with an updates Weber cam 
and new heavy duty rocker springs.  Before I put the rocker assemblies 
back on, the engine turns over fine using the fan bolt or even turning 
the fan belt.  When I put the rocker assemblies back on (in previous 
valve adjustment settings), the engine will turn up to a point, but 
then won't turn anymore.  Is this due to the heavy duty springs?  None 
of the springs are fully compressed when I'm trying to turn.

I'd like to get the valves adjusted before I put the engine back in so I 
don't have to puch it around the driveway to adjust the valves. (at 
least this time)  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Regards,

Dion

Subject: Spare keys again

Good Morning Jeff,

I hate to belabor the issue.  We are without a Porsche Dealer.  If you 
are looking for parts the former dealer has to call another dealer.  You 
can get some really screwey answers. 

I called Beverly Hills Porsche for the key info.  Whom ever answered the 
800 number in PANO gave me the aser of the earliest years being 1983 that 
keys could be cut from the vin#.

If you have a phone # of a cooperative type dealer (or anyone on the 
philes has one) it would be greatly appreciated.  We have searched the 
800 yellow pages without much success.

	I think your problem may be just condensation; that huge rear window can 
generate a lot of droplets over the course of a wet evening.  Try to put some 
paper towels in strategic places under the window and see if it's coming from 
there.  

	Regarding your door handle triggers, the door handles come off so easy 
that it is best to remove them and soak them with our good friend WD40 or similar.  
Then use some light oil to lubricate moving parts.  Oil is better than grease, 
since grease tends to go hard and picks up foreign particles which makes operation 
more difficult.  
	I have never tried to interchange parts of a VW/Audi door handle with a 
Porsche one, however I do still have some parts of VW/Audi doorhandles as they are 
notorious for seizing up.  I have successfully interchanged handles and parts of 
handles between all sorts of VW and Audi models; My guess would be that some of 
the parts would indeed interchange with Porsche parts, but I haven't tried....yet.

Ron,

This is correct.  As of the C4, the only available rims were the painted,
pressure-cast ones.  I think this remains true of all production wheels
since then, with the possible exception of the exotic rims used on the
911 Turbos.

Roger,

No street '87 Carrera came from the factory with 17" rims.  I don't know
anyone, off the top of my head, who runs a 3,2 Carrera with 17" rims
and so cannot point you towards an example.  But you will have to find
rims with the right offset, and you may need to make use of modified
steering stops and fenders which were introduced by Porsche for
people wishing to use 17" rims on 3,6 Carreras.

Hi, Mark,

Very hard to find. Plan on spending lots of money.

As recently as a couple of months ago, I saw an ad for a set of 4 for $1500.
Don't know  quality, etc.

They should fit on your 88 Turbo, but you will have to roll the lips of the
rear fender in order for your tires to clear.

Good luck

    Thanks to those who have responded to my befuddlement about my rear
calipers....  I think the problem may be that there are locking tabs on
the bolts - I doubt the calipers have ever been off my car.  Now that I
do think back, when I took the front calipers off, there was a metal
plate behind the bolts, just the sort of thing that would have locking
tabs on it (that would break off after the third or fourth go at it.) 
So hopefully that's my problem, I'll let you guys know when I get around
to checking it out again (I really do have classes and work and such....
 plays havoc with the important things in life, like the p-car...)  If
that's not what it is... um, anyone want to send me a complete driver's

    That's what I was doing... still felt too tight to me.  Of course,
somebody else has already pointed out that there might be locking tabs
keeping it from turning.  That would go a long way toward explaining
things.
    Also, unfortunately, the side I have to take apart was the side of
my garage that has no lights.  Hence the fact that I couldn't poke my
head in and see this.  But I digress.

    My Haynes manual tells me there were two different kinds of fittings
used for 914's - some were tapered thread, and others were straight
thread.  According to the book, mine should be straight.
    As even my flare nut wrench (eleven bucks!) wouldn't get the line
free, I had to use vise-grips and would prefer to get new fittings if at
all possible.  Anyone know if the above info. is correct and if so, how
to make sure I get the right stuff?
    Also, does anyone sell cheap tubing benders?  My grandpa has a bunch

Subject: 914 bucks

In the brief hour I had to drive my newly acquired 914 before I had to 
catch a flight to the east coast the car ran fairly well, but at times it 
would buck quite violently. This was on freeway driving, and accelerating 
seemes to make it go away. It got better as it warmed up, but even after 
an hour on the freeway it still did it on occasion. The car had sat for a 
few months before i bought it, and the tailpipe had a signifigant amount 
of soot built up. I would assume this means it's running rich and the 
(assumed) poor condition of the plugs is leading to misfiring. Similarly, 
sometimes the car would suddenly seem to loose a little power which would 
come back when I accelerated. 
	I'm going to be back in town fow two days before I have to leave 
again and I'm hoping in this time to get it running good so I can get it 
all registered and such. My plan is to replace the sparkplugs and see 
what that does, but judging from the tailpipe it's running quite rich. Is 
there a quick fix for this or should I wait till my manuals arrive and 
work on it then? This is a 1970 with the 1.7 BTW. It's got around 80k 
miles on it and within the past year it's had a valve job and had the 
injection control box replaced.

While working a stint in a friend's foreign repair shop I found that

Arn't the "A" calipers the cast version of the alloy calipers?

Everything was changed on the later 944s, primarily to allow Porsche to
build the 944 Turbo.

It's easier to tell you what was not changed: The front fenders, the rear
fenders and the rear hatch. If you look closely, just about everything else
is different.

No, there is not a notably significant difference between the handling and
ride of and early 85 and a late 85 car.

 Porsche - in this video -(IMHO) do an great job of telling us baby boomers
to "go for it" and spend the 60 or 70 large on a 993.  Actually, I see the
video as a way to get  people into the store to test drive the Porsche.  At
that point, if the money is there, the car is probably sold!  It's really
quite a video:  the background music, "Deep Forest", is quite spectacular all
by itself..

BTW, I first saw the video last week, the test drive sold me on the virtues
of the 993.

Yes, but it just seems that there's something wrong with packaging a $65K 
product, and spending only, hmm... 5%? 10%? of screen time on the product 
itself. If you're selling a car, show me the car, NOT other stuff. (I imagine 
Porsche must use a different ad company for their TV ads, since they're terrific... 
Exciting, and they show the car driving, which is what I believe should be 
shown.)

Sorta like those awful Saturn ads - they never once mention the actual car, just 
that it's built in Ammurika by good ol' boys.

Subject: 1983 911SC

Hello,
        I have been in the market for a used Porsche for a few months now
and appreciate all the great advice I have gotten from P-files.  I have
found an 83 911 SC that I like and has gotten a relatively clean bill of
health from the mechanic.  The owner is asking 17.7K for a car that is
cosmetically in good shape and has about 70K miles.  Mechanically, it needs
about $1,000-1,500 in work, mostly minor things.  It could also use a new
set of tires (about 20% left on the current set). Finally, the clutch is
fine but is fine now, but can not be adjusted any farther.
        First, does this seem a fair price considering the extra money I am
going to put inot the car?  Is this amount of repairs typical?
        Second, I have been reading of people who test drive lots of cars
before they find one they want to buy.  While I drove a few cars before
this one, they were all much newer and therefore hard for me to compare.
Time constraints prevent me from fully emersing myself in the car hunt
(i.e. daily searches through the classifieds, etc.), but I wonder if I am
cheating myself by considering the first car of the model year I want that
I have seen.
        Lastly, if I buy the car, I want to replacr the tires.  I am
considering Pirelli P7's.  Are these a god choice for street driving?
Also, what do I do with the old tires?  Is there a market for them or do I
just junk them?
        I greatly appreciate any help.
Thanks,
Brian Weiss

  HELP...

I was driving my 914 today when suddenly, I lost a little power and
saw a huge amount of oil smoke out of the exhaust.  After th oil burned
away, there was no smoke for a while, then the same thing again.  I
drove it home, and noticed a large amount of oil in the air filter box,
the intake plenum, and around the sheet metal.  My 914 has the factory fuel
injection (2.0 liter), and the engine is in resonable shape (one minor
oil leak in the rear main seal (to be fixed next weekend if this is not a
major problem)  I havent noticed any strange sounds, but I am not good
at diagnosing things by sound.  Does anyone know what this could be, the
amount of oil seems to indicate it is coming from somewhere then burning
through the engine....

Well a couple of quick things come to mind"

	1. Burned piston, broken rings, sucked a valve,

all of these are possible. need to do a compression ck first. As you 
take out the plugs look at them one of them could be oil soaked. This 
would be the cylinder which has the problem.

If the compression is ok then start looking around for exterior oil 
leaks which may have looked like exhaust leak.

Subject: Questions on 911 wheels 

I need some advice on 911 wheels!
I have been on the track a number of years with a 1972 911S having 6 inch
wheels and R type track tires, 205x60x15. Recently, I had a new 1989 Carrera
3.2 engine put in the car (250 hp), with a racing suspension ( ie heavy
torsion bars, sport shocks, and upper strut bearings with stress bar).
Therefore, I have been thinking of buying  7 or 8 inch wheels with maybe
225x50x15 in back and 205x50x15 in front. The wider wheels will cost me
$800. and another $600 to pull out the rear fenders. The shop which set up
my car said that wider tires are not really necessary, and my money would be
better spent on more suspension work. They also recommended that if I did
want wider tires, that I should buy 7" wheels with 205x50x15 on all four
wheels. But, I sort of think that wider back tires would be good if there is
enough space on the inside of the rear tires ( with the 205 tires now, there
is only 10 mm between the edge of the tire now and the oil lines ).
Therefore, I tried putting on a  8" wheel on the right rear with a 225x50x15
tire, and there seems to be plenty of inside room, with almost all the
larger width going to the outside of the car - sticking about 2" beyound the
fender, but about 1 inch below the fender lip. This really surprised me!  
Questions: (1) are all 1984-89 Carrera wheels made so that the extra width
goes to the outside (instead on inside)? (2) Am I safe that 225x50x15 rear
tires will not rub on the oil lines?  (3) Do I have to flare the rear
fenders, even though the botton of the fender is about 1 inch above the
tire, because of bouncing? (4) will the wider tires provide a substantial
advantage in traction? (5) Are the wider wheels worth the cost - $1,500.?    
I would appreciate your advice and experiences.

Yes, with the seat all the way down and the back tilted suitably to keep
my head from pressing against the roof, the seat has to come forward for
my hands to reach the steering wheel. At some point my knees contact the
dash. One solution might be to extend the steering column 1.5" or 2".

Never had any trouble getting in or out, unless I was climbing in upside
down to work under the dash.

I plan on pursuing the Porsche service bulletin on the subject, and also
(per Stan's suggestions) pull the seat and consider alterations there.

As for the carrying capacity of the car, its great! In 1993 when shopping
for casual transportation I wanted another hatchback. Really wanted another
4 dr VW Golf but they were not available for another 6 months.

My most memorable moment hauling things with my 928 came when I was asked
to drive a severely disabled friend & attendant home. Was handed the keys
to a Chevy Celebrity stationwagon. It was awful. Fortunately my 928 was
parked on the route so we stopped and figured out how to fit everything
in it. What passed for a wheelchair was folded and went in the front.
Attendant went in right rear seat, and a bed was made for my friend in
the rear. His head nearest the exhaust pipe. The next 45 miles I was
barraged with "how fast are we going?" 60 or 65. "So this is a Porsche?
That's all the faster it goes?". Got within a mile of his house and realized
this was the last opportunity so I didn't slow down when turning off 4 lanes
onto his road. Nice drift on that corner. Shifted down to 3rd and punched
it on exit from the corner. We stayed below 80 on a 2 lane country road with
good visibility but the engine was making wonderful music. Daryl screamed the
whole way, "Slow down! You're gonna get us killed!" We had a great time. Its 
been several years, but he still tells visitors about his ride in a Porsche, 
right up there with his ride in an airplane and trip to Niagara Falls.

In the Uk recently there was a ho-ha about discount gas, and it became 
clear that the discount stuff was definitely inferior -

the discount shops ( our superstores ) were not putting in any of the 
detergent additives, with the consequence that valves wer getting badly 
fouled.

As soon as sales were effected, the discount shops started adding 
detergent. Whether the special additives are the same or as good is a 
matter of conjecture, but shell etc have no longer got the stick to beat 
them with.

Hey All,

Well, now I have had a sound engine in the 911 for 7 months I've decided
I need to work on something else :-)

So....I'm tired of all the graunching noises and *HAVING* to double
clutch into 1st and sometimes 2nd.   I'm going to replace the 1st
and 2nd gear synchros.  I have several questions:

1 - Is it possible to do this in a weekend assuming I have all the parts
    in hand before I start.  Including R&I ?

2 - I need a hydraulic press right ?  Or do I ?  This may sound dumb, but
    what exactly is a hydraulic press - ie is it something I can buy
    cheaply or is it like some big floor standing machine shop tool ?

3 - What parts typically will I need to replace.  1st and 2nd gear
    synchros, are the gears themselves usually worn to the point of
    needing replacement ?

4 - After driving a friends 425hp modified 300zx Twin Turbo over spring
    break I've decided I need a liiiitle more acceleration <grin>.  I'm
    toying with the idea of changing out the ring and pinion to 7.3:1
    ratio.  What additional parts will require replacement ?  What other
    caveats are there with this mod ?  Are there other ratios available
    that I should look at rather than the 7.3:1 (which is the one I see
    advertised, stock is 8.3:1 right ?) ?

Any and all advice solicited with advance grateful thanks.

OK! I have seen a lot of these mail order companies selling
stone guards for the 944 front and rear quarter panel. Not once
have I seen any advertisement for the Rocker stone guard (i.e the
stone guard that runs along the length of the car below the doors)

Rocker stone guard on my car is beginning to show it age (some
peeling and cracking), so I would either like to it fixed or
replace it. Since I don't have a clue, as how to do either, I
would like to ask the following questions.

    Do other 944 owners have a similar pealing problem ( mine is
    85/2 944)? 

    Is there a fix available or do I have to replace individual
    pieces?
    
    If so, where can I buy this stuff from or who makes it (3M
	or Wurth)?

    Does it come in clear or does it needs painting after
    installation?

    What kind of an expense, am I looking at?

    J.C. Witney sells self adhesive wide tape ( Sort of like a duct
    tape but thicker and stronger) in black color for about $30. They
    claim that it can be painted. It this a good substitute, any horror
    stories?

    I have also seen side skirts for around $274/pair at Tweeks. What
    is the general opinion about this looks? Any used one for sale
	George?
	
	Are their any significant benefits of the side skirts, when it 
	comes to track events. Can I still compete in the Stock class.

If you were in this predicement which one of the above alternatives
would you prefer.

Subject: Forged vs. cast

 
Ron S asked about the unavailability of factory forged wheels for the 993.
 
That's right, they're all cast now. They are using a new process which they
claim makes them as strong as the old forged wheels. I'm not sure,
they may be vacuum cast like the 993 rear suspension members. This means you
don't get bubbles and voids and such to act as perfect little stress raisers.
 
If you are worried about the strength of the wheels, consider that 1) they
would have to be stronger to take the higher cornering loads made possible
by the 993 suspension and latest tire technology; 2) the German TUeV won't
allow substandard wheels onto the market; your registration becomes void if 
you put on non-TUeV approved, non-type-certified wheels etc.; 3) they are 
using the same technology for the 993 Turbo and the Carrera Cup cars which 
have even higher wheel loads. 4) in a world full of scumsucking lawyers 
Porsche won't take a backward, potentially suicidal step with something 
like wheel strength.
 
Then of course the're The T*d who swears that the only wheels worthy of the
name are BBS alloys, they're STRONG, man, you can bounce dem offa curbs and
dey won' crack. I think he's still trying to sell some T*d-tested wheels

Just out of curiosity, do you know if your Passat is Made in Chermanny or
Hecho en Mexico? If you can't find a "made in --- by proud craftsmen"

WVW, it's German.
 
You have to remember that at present, as far as we are concerned, VW is no
longer a German car company. Virtually all of their products for North
America are made in Mexico. (I had a Golf Cab a few weeks ago that was
German production, Karmann, but I think that's only because it's made by an

U.S. presence than it had 10 or 15 years ago. It's a tiny company, dealers
are going away, someday it may go the same route as Fiat and Peugeot in this

Subject:       1975 porsche 911- purchase help

Hi,

I'm looking to purchase a use porsche and have looked at a few and am 
tring to decide which one to get.  I found a 1971 911T with 146,000 
miles on it that is selling for $6,000 from a used car dealer.  The body 
etc seems to be in good shape, but there is a lot of oil all over the 
engine.  The dealer claims to have spent $800 on repairing rust under 
the car.  Is this a good deal?

I have also looked at a 1975 911 that was imported from Germany.  The 
owner says that the engine was replaced in 1979 in Germany and has 
33,000 miles on the replaced engine.  The car has a sportmatic tranny 
and the owner says that it clunks sometimes.  There is a lot of oil 
leaking and owner claims the main oil seal needs to be replaced at cost 
of $3,000.   The price is $5,000.  I like this car should I look at it 
some more?

Subject: RE : Questions on 911 wheels

James Stephenson asked several questions on putting bigger wheels
and tires on a '72 S track car and flaring the rear.

> Recently, I had a new 1989 Carrera 3.2 engine put in the car (250 hp) 

This engine is heavier than your stock engine, so the car will not
be as well balanced with same size wheels on the rear. Stock, your car
had 40/60 weight distribution, now it is even worse. You can get better
handling with wider rear wheels AND tires. What did you do with
your old engine - want to sell it???

> Therefore, I have been thinking of buying  7 or 8 inch wheels with maybe
> 225x50x15 in back and 205x50x15 in front.

These should work OK. You may want to run 225/50/15 on the front
and 245/50/15 on the rear. They work great on 7x8 with SC type rear flares.
However, flaring the car will reduce it's value, as there are not many
2.4S left stock. I guess you could put stock flares back on at some point if
desired. You may also have to "roll" your front fender lip with the 
225/50 on 7" rims.

> The shop which set up my car said that wider tires are not really 
> necessary, and my money would be better spent on more suspension work. 

You mentioned that the suspension was already quite modified. The wider
tires and wheels would help even if your suspension was STOCK, more than
any suspension modifications. It sounds like the shop wants to make
more money from mods (they won't make any money if you buy wheels/tires
elsewhere). Tires and wheels are the most important part of your
car for performance (more than engine even).

> They also recommended that if I did want wider tires, that I should 
> buy 7" wheels with 205x50x15 on all four wheels. 

These may not even fit under stock rear flares. And you will have to make
the front of the car too stiff to get rid of the oversteer due to
too-small rear tire contact patch for the car. Does this shop have
a lot of track experience (winning cars)? Doesn't sound like it.

>Questions: (1) are all 1984-89 Carrera wheels made so that the extra width
>goes to the outside (instead on inside)? 

All 911 wheels except the early 911R 7x15 have this type of offset, with
the extra width on the outside. So the inside clearance should not be a
problem. The 7 and 8 by 15's you are looking for became available in
late '74 on the 2.7 Carrera, and later the Turbo and SC used them too.

>(2) Am I safe that 225x50x15 rear tires will not rub on the oil lines?  

Yes, even 245/50/15 will not rub if you use the factory offset. I used the
911R 7x15 offset on my '72 S and had slight oil line rubbing with
225/50/15 tires. I had to use a 1/4" spacer with the R offset (revolution) 
wheels. By the way, the revolution wheels are quite a bit heavier than 
the Fuchs forged alloys.

> (3) Do I have to flare the rear fenders, even though the bottom of the 
> fender is about 1 inch above the tire, because of bouncing? 

Probably.As the suspension works, the tire will come into contact with
the fender about 1" above the lip and bubble your paint (guess how I
know?).

>(4) will the wider tires provide a substantial
>advantage in traction? 

Yes, your car can not be correctly balanced (under/oversteer) with
the same size tires on all four wheels. Well, it can be balanced (I've
done it for staying within stock rules) but it will not be optimized.

>(5) Are the wider wheels worth the cost - $1,500.?    

Since your engine is modified, you might as well go to the limits of
the rules and flare your fenders and get some 7 and 8" wheels. You should
be able to find a set of used wheels for under $1000 in perfect working
condition. It is not a cost like tires- you will get your money back when
you sell the wheels in good condition. Think of them as an investment.

You should come to some of the Connecticut Valley autocrosses with
your car, I'd love to see it! I would be glad to help you set it up.

Regards, Mike Piera '72 911S (with 2 sets of 7 & 8 x 15 wheels which
won't even begin to fit under my stock fenders. But I do use the 7's)

P.S. I'll be in France most of this week w/o net access.

You checked the obvious thing (the aux air valve) and the decel valve as
someone suggested, but the problem is the PCV valve hose (since you already
checked the vacuum system for leaks). It is probably sucking air through the
open PCV. This hose is connected to the right passenger side of the oil
filler. Simply pull it off, put your finger over the hose and the idle should
die down. Try it!

The sticking caliper can be a clogged flex hose or sticking caliper. These
are both easily diagnosed and repaired. Write for details.

It depends on what you have to replace.  If you have to push gears on
and off the two shafts, for example to replace their dog gears, yes,
you'll need one.  No idea what they cost or whether they can be rented.
It may also be that you can rent or buy a puller with a really long grip,
but I don't know.

Typically synchros and, if you've been naughty, dog gears.   Sometimes
operating sleeves and other stuff.  You  probably don't want to invest in
all these parts on spec.  So you might want to plan on using one weekend
for tear-down, the week to order and receive what you need, and reassemble
the next weekend.

Hope this helps.

Hello Peter and other Porschephiliacs,
	About the Passat, all of this model is produced in Germany along 
with the Golf Cabrio, Jetta GLX, Corrado(NLA?), and Eurovan.  Only the 
normal Golf, Jetta, and GTI come from Mehico.  I researched this 
thoroughly before advising my dad to get a '94 Passat GLX VR6(he loves it 
and seems to have high assembly quality. Maybe the other one was built on 
Monday?)  Its somehow hard for me to believe that someone in Mehico 
making $2.00 an hour would build a better car with as much care as 
someone making $24.00 an hour in Germany.  
	Unfortunately, the plain Golf and Jetta are the ones selling 
well.  It's too bad VW had to quit its US assembly at the time when its 
becoming fashionable for other makers.  The move to Mehico has been 
disastrous for them with poor assembly quality and numerous labor 
strikes.  I too would be surprised to see them here after five years.  
Our market would be much the less without them :^(

Hi, Jeff.
 
Gosh, somebody thinks I flamed you. (See previous post).
In case you feel warm, apologies and all
that. I flamed some of the cars you like, don't take it personally <g>. In
fact, if I managed to talk you out of ever getting a Viper, shouldn't I get
an unfinder's fee for the money and grief I saved you? Doesn't sound like I
succeeded though.
 
I wanted to express my opinions (I'm beginning to doubt of the existence of
non-mathematical fact in a modern universe) re test equipment, magazine test
procedures, atmospheric fudge factors for performance correction and how/why
magazines fudge on test equipment and Truth (or Fact, whatever that is).
 
Yes, C/D and SCI (used to; not any more) use the same equipment. I no longer
test for SCI (they "don't see the value of testing," and life's too short to
educate child editors), so SCI no longer has access to the equipment. I now
use my equipment for Autoweek and other clients among magazines
and industry. The third organization that uses the equipment (aside from
development departments at car companies) is Consumer Reports. Lord only
knows what THEY do with it. ("We drag strip test all the Earth Muffin Cars
- -- story on p. 87; sidebar: "Safety Fast -- the Amazing Wheelstanding CR
Volvo Wagon, p. 93...")
 
>I do recall seeing a picture of the Diablo with the fifth wheel hung off it
 
If it is the same equipment as I use, look carefully, there should not be
anything that remotely resembles a round wheel-like device touching the
ground. Just some black contraption that looks like some sort of rocket
launcher pointed down.
 
>Career dreams of becoming a car magazine photographer
 
Keep your day job.
 
The usual career path is something like
1) enthusiasm for cars, combined with good cameras, creativity, and
patience.
2) lots of car magazine work. The four big books pay OK. The
bikini-bimbo-by-pickup books don't pay, you almost have to pay THEM for the
privilege of seeing your work in print. And they capitalize on that.
Example: typical payment for 5-page feature, including writing and writer's
own photographs, $125. Most pros burn more than $125 in film and processing
alone for a single good big-book spread.
3) disgust with car magazines and looking for new outlets.
4) lots of advertising work, shooting cars. Advertising (or any sort of
commercial work) PAYS.
 
Look at Jeff Zwart. Started with R&T. Done good. Done so good that his
rates went so high R&T could only afford him to shoot good covers, and then
not at all. They hired his studio, and JZ would assign one of his staff to
do it. Did lots of advertising shots. Made big money. Bought big house in
Newport Beach. Turned to video format (car company TV commercials). Made more
money. Started rallying Porsche C4. Bought house in Aspen or someplace high
and cold and expensive. That's how it's done.
 
>C/D has been a long-time favorite.
 
Yeah. You need to go back to the really old C/D. Yates, Warren Weith, LJK
Setright (_I_ like him, nobody else this side of the Atlantic seems to
understand his sense of humor). David E. Davis way back when. Here, I'll
haul one out. December 72 (chosen at random). Pat Bedard before he whacked
the wall at Indy. William Jeanes. Don Sherman. Gordon Jennings. Photos and
art by Pete Biro and Ken Dallison. That's just from the masthead. These
people are legendary. I liked C/D's irreverence to balance R&T's
conservatism, and eagerly bought both. I grew up reading about the
Cannonball, Brock Yates' "Sunday Driver," Sam Posey's "Mudge Pond Express."
The 70s were a dismal era for car design, but the high point of automotive
publishing.
 
Thinking about R&T at the time, they had Henry Manney when he was still alive
and Stan Mott cartoons when he was still funny. Real editors like Dean
Batchelor and Tony Hogg and Jim Crow. Manney, Batchelor, Hogg and Crow have
all passed on.
 
Other long dead lamented magazines: Road Test. Sports Cars Illustrated (LONG
time ago, not the more recent Sports Car Illustrated --> Sports Car
International).
 
To correct myself in my earlier post to you (private? don't recall) re top
speed tracks:
Last night I talked to a friend who works in the R&D department of a large
Japanese car company. He thinks you could go 200+ at Honda/TRC in Ohio. I
remember seeing its hands-off speed at 130 mph or so. His company has an
even larger facility in Arizona where the hands-off speed through the turns
is 190ish.

Hi, Scott.
 
Gosh, I didn't mean to flame Jeff Kyle. I didn't call him any names, did I?
I did call some of his favorite cars some names but that's an occupational
hazard that comes of writing about cars. See next post. It is a good idea
not to confuse choice of car with personal character. It is therefore
possible to assassinate a car without actually damaging the owner. <g>
 
The whole idea of my post was just to point out that
1) don't believe everything you read;
2) fair is fair, you probably shouldn't even believe my posts, nor I yours
(or anybody else's);
3) car magazines lie. They aren't the New England Journal of Medicine (and
now some doctor should come in and say NEJM is a running dog lackey of the
Yankee imperialist capitalist pillmongers.)
 
Car magazines are "wish books." They do not need to print truth, or accurate
road tests, any more than Playboy needs to print accurate performance tests
of the Playmate of the Month. (Again, to quote that R&T editor, "it would
shatter all their dreams..."). Perhaps this is where my present attitude of
doubting everything in the universe comes from -- in high school, one of my
math teachers, Mr. Dogadalski, said "You guys all think that the world is
full of girls like the ones in Playboy. Let me tell ya, those photos are all
retouched." At which point some guy in the back yelled out "Yeah, every
night." But too late for humor, the damage had been done. My dreams were
shattered and I drifted off to cars, hoping to find Truth there... <g>
 
If you are going to nominate me for Flamer of the Year award, think twice.
That means I would have to turn pro. Then I couldn't just flame people
because I WANT to, I would have to have a work order, in triplicate, etc.
True, I could still flame people in my spare time, but it just wouldn't be
the same. (Oh, excuse me, did you sign up for the introductory 5 minute flame
or the full course of 30 sessions?) And a monthly retainer. And then I'd have
to try out for the big time, like Andy Rooney's job etc. (is he a flamer or
just a whiner? Not sure). And I'd have to measure myself against the true
Giants of Professional Flaming, like John Cleese.

Greetings:

<Well, now I have had a sound engine in the 911 for 7 months I've decided I

(text deleted)

I will try to answer your questions one at a time.

1.  Yes, but the problem here is knowing ahead of time just what parts you
need.  Normally this job involves more than just replacing the synchros
themselves.  Other wear items are the engagement dog rings on the gears,
 operating sleeves and occasionally bearings.

2.  Right.  You will also need a fixture to hold the shafts in the press as
you disassemble them.  A universal "bearing splitter will usually suffice if
it's large enough.  A press *is* a large floor standing shop tool which start
in price at about $300.00 for a discount tool store 12 ton model and go up
from there.  Probably not worth buying for 1 job.
You may also need special tools to replace the engagement dog rings, if
necessary and a deep (approx. 14") 41 mm socket to remove and install the
mainshaft nut.  Also a holding fixture for the mainshaft is necessary to
remove the nut.

3.  You will need a gasket set, 1st gear synchro band and a 2nd gear synchro
band.  There is also a small o-ring on the T.O. bearing guide tube which I
don't believe comes in the gasket set.  The P/N is 999.701.359.40.  In
addition, you may need a 1st gear engagement dog ring, a 2nd gear engagement
dog ring, a 1-2 gear operating sleeve, and possibly synchro bands on 3rd, 4th
and 5th gears as well.  Another thing to check for, especially if it's a high
mileage car, is for bearing indentations on the inside of each gearset where
it rolls on the bearing.  This will show up as verticle lines on the inner
race surface.  If you see this on a gear it's best to replace that gearset.
 This can cause not only noise, but the increased friction in that bearing
can cause excessive heat leading to eventual gear failure.  Gears themselves
do not normally wear out unless the trans has run out of gear lube.  If this
had occurred you would have more to worry about than weak synchros.  In
addition you will need 2 locking nuts, P/N 915.302.282.00 for the pinion
shaft and P/N 915.302.281.00 for the mainshaft.  These are one time use nuts
which should be replaced any time a 915 trans is disassembled.

4.  The 7:31 ring and pinion is a good conversion, especially with the
generally shorter gear ratios in the 8:31 gearboxes.  This however requires
special equipment and skill beyond the scope of most hobbyists and is best
left to a pro.  The setup of a ring and pinion is very critical and can't be
guessed at.

5.  This isn't an answer to a question, but this is also the time to pull the
T.O. bearing crosshaft out of the transmission housing so you can clean it up
and lube its bearings.  Also check the guide tube for wear and replace it if
necessary.  These are both contributors to stiff clutch operation.

Hope this helps and good luck with your project.

I have an old photograph on my wall from a 1968 SCCA race held on the

there, I think).  When the picture appeared in the local paper, I
ordered a copy.  It shows a single, privateer Lotus Elan leading a pack
of C-production factory supported cars.  Included were two 911S's
driven by Alan Johnson and Milt Minter, a team of Toyota 2000's, a team
of Datsun 2000's, and a few other similar cars.  The Elan went on to
win the race, to my delight.  I owned an Elan at the time.  I loved
that car, and didn't even have much trouble with it or the successor I
got a few years later when that one was totaled (the Lincoln it hit

Short answer [just got back from exhausting vacation]:

I've been through this, and wouldn't recommend a rebuilt rack without a

around $250, and about 1.5 years & 5000 miles later it failed the same 
way, except catastrophically, dumping all power steering fluid during a 
track event.

I have been driving with the power steering pump disconnected since 
then - it's NO fun!  Shortly I'll be installing a new rack, purchased

Lot's of it! I was in the last run group. I couldn't beat Lori's time though,

James,  You probably will get a bunch of replies on your wheel questions.
 Here's mine...

>3.2 engine put in the car (250 hp), with a racing suspension ( ie heavy
>torsion bars, sport shocks, and upper strut bearings with stress bar).

Having done this not too long ago myself and running the combination your
shop is recommending (7x15s w/ 225/50/15), I think your intuition about
wider rear wheels is right on in this case.  The power to contact patch
ratio is damn near dangerous the way you are currently set up (with 6s) and
not too much better with 7s.  Before I go on, I'd highly recommend a limited
slip in the differential if you haven't done so already -- I like my Quaife,
but other's are equally hooked on the factory ZF one (I think I could *kill*
a equally set-up ZF equipped car on a tight course (In My Humble Opinion
Alert here)).

>Questions: (1) are all 1984-89 Carrera wheels made so that the extra width
>goes to the outside (instead on inside)?

Yes.

>(2) Am I safe that 225x50x15 rear
>tires will not rub on the oil lines?

Yes, but this depends on *your* car and the wheel offsets, as well as the
tire you run (Yoko's w/ their softer sidewall, rubbed on my spring plates --
not the oil lines, whereas BFGs did not).

>(3) Do I have to flare the rear
>fenders, even though the botton of the fender is about 1 inch above the
>tire, because of bouncing?

To get anything bigger than a 7 on you do, and a 7 has to have a deeper
backset (more wheel inside than outside) -- 5 1/8" seems to do it fine for
most.

> (4) will the wider tires provide a substantial
>advantage in traction?

Absolutely, as will a ltd. slip.

>(5) Are the wider wheels worth the cost - $1,500.?

The SC or Carrera flares are nice looking and you can stuff a lot of wheel
underneath them.  I used 911 Turbo 9x16s with 245/45/16 on the rear (5 1/2"
backset) and standard offset fuchs 8x15s with 225/50/15 on the front, with
the only mods being SC flares in the rear and rolled fender lips in the
front -- Oh, and BFG R1s -- they don't flex much.  Real Turbo 9x16s are
getting verrry popular -- so you might want to have some HRE's made up in
the right offset -- might as well do the fronts too so they look the same.
 Price will be in the same $1500 range not including body work for flares
and bumper extension mods.

Subject: Re: 911 SC Ring and Pinion Ratio/Tranny Rebuild

Martin-
After having done three of these things, I can probably answer your
question from the standpoint of a non-professional.

1. Can you do the repair in a weekend:  Maybe, if you have everything you 
will need at hand.  But it will be hard to Porschephiles #1276                         Mon Mar 27 13:37:18 CST 1995
know exactly what you will 
need until you get it opened up.  I would suggest a two weekend scenario,
one to get it out tear it down and order parts,  the next weekend to 
reassemble and replace.  This leaves out ring and pinion changes which 
complicate things greatly IMHO.  If you do this, you will need some very
expensive tools, or a lot of time, and gear marking compound, plus a 
shoebox full of shims.   

2. Do you need a hydraulic press:  I have done this without one,  but I   
would not reccommend it.  With gear pullers, hammers etc., it is possible,
but the possibility/probability of damage gets high.  A hydraulic press 
is a floor standing piece of equipment, at least it is if it is big 
enough to be usefull for what you want it for.  It will cost $250-350
for a Republic of China Special.  You will probably need about $200 in  
other tools,some of these can be home-made, but you might need some  
originals to copy.

3. What parts will you need to replace:  beside synchro's, maybe the 
dog-clutch rings and teeth, possibly some bearings.  It is not too likely
that any gears will need to be replaced, if the transmission has been 
well cared for.

4. As far as pitfalls, take very good notes upon teardown, label all of 
needle bearings and their races, keep carefull track of all of the detent 
parts. 

I know that this is not very detailed, but it may help you.  If you have 
any questions, let me know.

I just looked, and unfortunately, there is no FAQ for water-pumpers.  However, 
just being on the list is even better than having a FAQ, we have *lots* of 
dedicated Pumper fans.  Ask your questions to the list, and you'll get *Lots of 
helpful guidance.  (can't blame you for wanting a 911 though...) <vbg>

BTW, although I *love* the 911 (always have, since first sight of one on the 
streets of Wiesbaden, in November, '64), a 928S or S4 was my *First* choice.
My frau didn't like getting in and out of the 928, so I *settled* for the 911

Neither am I, but I still liked it.   It's clear they are appealing to the
boomer crowd who is *probably not very knowledgable about Porsches*.
They are lookng to develop new interest from a crowd that probably has never
seriously considered a Porsche--not solidify existing support.

IMHO, forgiving the relative lack of action, it's a great piece of work
for the way it appeals to the subjective, emotional aspect of Porsche

Matt-

>I'm willing to personally do all the prep stuff I 
>can to keep costs down. 

If you do all the prep stuff, like stripping off the old paint, 
taking off the trim pieces, masking, repairing the small rusted 
spots, filling small imperfections with plastic filler and putty,  
and sanding, you're almost finished!  Why not do the rest 
yourself too?  Most of the cost of a good paint job is in the prep 
work, not the painting.  And none of it is hard.  It's just time 
consuming.  Your costs will be something like:

1) Stripper  -  2 gallons at $25/gal

2) Sanding blocks, sandpaper, filler, putty - $50

3) Primers, paint and thinners- cost depends on color and type 
 - $200 to $400 is a good guess

4) Wet sandpaper, rubbing and polishing compounds - $50

That's $500 or so.  If you can't borrow or rent a compressor, 
add
$350, and another $50 for a spray gun.  (You can get a very 
good gun for $40.  Let me know if you decide to go this route 
and I'll tell you which one.)

>Do I need to get this thing bead blasted?

Nope. Chemical stripper (see above) is messy but it works.  In 
fact, if the old paint isn't cracked or crazed or too thick, you 
can often get by with sanding it to rough it up, and then 
painting right over it.

>I would much rather paint it a darker color (like british racing 
>green)

If you go for a dark color, make sure your panels are all nice 
and straight.  Any imperfections show up like gangbusters 
with dark colors.

Subject: 914/6s


Lest all of you think I just play with water-coolers, I have owned 
the 914/6s, one of which was a 914/6 GT. I race the living p*** out of 
them. Time-trials, autocrosses, etc. 

That's what the factory built them for. It was stated "The 914/4 will 
please most customers. The 914/6 is for the enthusiast who demands the
normal level of Porsche performance for competitive events." 1969
Porsche advertizing.

There were a handfull in the San Francisco area that were autocrossed.
Rick Ford, Bob Zulkowski, Myself, Troy Powell, Bernie Buschen, Darryl
Overstreet, Phil Mullen and a couple of others. We did well. In 1980
they shove Bernie Buschen and I in with the Corvettes. We finished 1-2
ahead of them in the local NCSCC series. Dave Colman ran his 914/6 in 
the SCCA series, also winning. Then there was the PCA Zone 7 series,
914/6 being the preferred car in the zone race tire classes. 

Mike Willis and many others competed in the same series with 914/4. They 
were quite successful.

If a 914/6 is solid, there's no reason not to play.

For anybody who cares about the soap opera world of car magazine publishing:
 
I just got off the phone with a Highly Placed Unimpeachable Source. Sports
Car International is on the auction block. The magazine never made any money
for its new owner, Tom Toldrian, who also owns Excellence and a woodworking
magazine. Toldrian fired the editor who had made the magazine what it was,
Mark Ewing, and hired some kid who worked for a lower salary. The ad page
count kept dropping, the magazine got thinner and the articles were less
interesting for a broader base of readers. Now he just wants out from under.
 
When the original owner of SCI, a printer in the Chicago suburbs, wanted
out, I personally drove up to the Bay Area and got Toldrian interested in
acquiring SCI for his magazine "empire." I figured I did most of my testing
and writing for them, so if a new, friendly owner had it, my future as a

Admittedly Ewing was difficult to get along with, but damn, he knew cars and
he knew car people and put together a beautiful book at the end. The new kid

Hi,

I'm looking to purchase a use porsche and have looked at a few and am 
tring to decide which one to get.  I found a 1971 911T with 146,000 
miles on it that is selling for $6,000 from a used car dealer.  The body 
etc seems to be in good shape, but there is a lot of oil all over the 
engine.  The dealer claims to have spent $800 on repairing rust under 
the car.  Is this a good deal?

I have also looked at a 1975 911 that was imported from Germany.  The 
owner says that the engine was replaced in 1979 in Germany and has 
33,000 miles on the replaced engine.  The car has a sportmatic tranny 
and the owner says that it clunks sometimes.  There is a lot of oil 
leaking and owner claims the main oil seal needs to be replaced at cost 
of $3,000.   The price is $5,000.  I like this car should I look at it 
some more?

Subject: What a weekend!

Well, we finally had a beautiful weekend here in Northern Ca.  Got to
take the car out for it's first long excursion.  Wife and self put
250 miles on it.  Went over to the Napa valley, took a few winding roads
and a few straights.  Opened it up and it really performed great.
Max speed 90 (safely), max rpm 4500.  Still only 300 miles on my rebuild.

Now for a couple of questions.  When first starting the engine, oil
pressure is about 5 to 6 bar at idle.  Once warm the pressure drops below 
2 bar at idle and barely reaches 4 to 5 at high rpm's.  Normal?

Second, the oil level gauge that had not been working, finally started to
work at the end of our drive.  At idle the gauge reads between 5 and 6 qts,
at 3 to 4k rpm, reads in red below lowest reading.  Again, Normal?
This last one has me worried, because even taking a level reading the
manual way (dipstick) with engine warm and running, I barely get a reading.

Anyway, I hope this weather keeps up.  I actually had the courage to drive
it to work today.  (No rear targa seal, but no clouds in the sky)

I had the EXACT same problem with my 84 944, except over time it gets WORSE,
I could actually see the water streaming into my car <yuck>.  Had weather
stip replaced, no help.  Adjusted length of the cone-bolts that lock the
latch into place, no help.  Went to a glass installer, no help.  Went to the
dealer - "Oh, yeah we can fix it, should take 4 to 6 hours at $85 an hour",
yeah right, goodbye.  They did put me on the right track, saying the pattern
(indentation) that was left on the weather stipping indicated that the hatch
was not sitting correctly.

I spent some time with foam weather stripping adding pieces all over the
place.  I endid up 'building up' the weather stipping by inserting piecesof
 round weather stripping inside and under the exsisiting strip, starting 3"
from each corner, through the corner, and 3" up the side.  That was 2 years
ago, and walla, leak gone.  If this is a bit confusing, give me a call at 212

Subject: Depressed

Howdy gang,

I have an 85.5 944, which I have owned since new.  It has ~94,000.  I
pulled it out of the garage, this weekend,  having stored it for the winter. 
I had changed all the fluids last fall, as a prep for storage.  I even 
started it every month during the winter, just to keep things lubed and 
to move it around just enough to prevent tire distortion.  Everything
looked fine each time a ran the car.  Per normal 944 aging, I have noticed
that as the car has gotten older, the water temp would fluctuate more widely, 
but never to either extreme.  I had plans to replace the radiator, and upgrade
the thermostat and fan switches per lower open/turn-on temps, this spring.  I
had the preverbial 944 water pump problems at about 28k miles, so I believe I 
have at least one generation of water pump upgrades.  At any rate, after a brief
warm-up, I took it out on the road.  What a great feeling...until the master
engine warning light started to flicker not a mile from my house.  Everything 
looked fine except the water temp.  By the time I got turned around, and back
to the house, the needle was at the bottom of the red mark.  I noticed smoke
from under the hood, so popped it.  I had assumed a hose, but nooooooooooo!!
The coolant tank was pretty much empty, and the smoke was oil leaking from
what looks like the bottom of the cam-shaft housing gasket(?) at the rear
of the valve cover assembly.  This leaking oil was dripping down on to the
exaust manifold.  SH*T.  No other leaking.  I pulled the dipstick, now thinking
loss of oil.  The color of the oil on the dipstick looks like chocolate milk.
SH*T again!!.  Anti-freeze and oil mixture??

Well, I am thinking right now that I have, best case scenario, a blown head(?)
gasket.  Worst case, a cracked block. 

I live in Moscow, Idaho.  Not exactly the Porsche service availablity spot of
the world.  Most all of the work ever done on my car, except basic service,
was done in Boise(300 miles south), by John Harris, a factory-trained, 
water-cooled Porsche specialist/expert.  While I could take it to him, I think
I would like to do the work myself.  I have a garage, a fairly good set of 
tools, the time and money.  Having reviewed what the `Haynes' manual provides,
I am thinking of buying the factory shop manuals, and starting the job.

A few questions first:

  1.  What is the general diagnosis of the above symptoms?
      
  2.  The Haynes manual says the head gasket can be replaced with the engine
      in the car.  I will be doing a compression check tonight, but with the
      high mileage, I would suspect that a partial engine rebuild might be 
      in order if I am going to go through the work of replacing the head
      gasket.  What other items should I consider replacing/reworking?  Valves,
      rings etc?

  3.  Besides the belt-tensioning sensitivity, what other tricky items are
      there to consider?

  4.  Does anyone know of a reliable mechanic in the Spokane, WA area?

  5.  Suspecting a cracked block, is magna-fluxing the best way to find
      the problem if it is not clearly visable?


Thanks in advance,

Bob W.

James,  You probably will get a bunch of replies on your wheel questions.
 Here's mine...

>3.2 engine put in the car (250 hp), with a racing suspension ( ie heavy
>torsion bars, sport shocks, and upper strut bearings with stress bar).

Having done this not too long ago myself and running the combination your
shop is recommending (7x15s w/ 225/50/15), I think your intuition about
wider rear wheels is right on in this case.  The power to contact patch
ratio is damn near dangerous the way you are currently set up (with 6s) and
not too much better with 7s.  Before I go on, I'd highly recommend a limited
slip in the differential if you haven't done so already -- I like my Quaife,
but other's are equally hooked on the factory ZF one (I think I could *kill*
a equally set-up ZF equipped car on a tight course (In My Humble Opinion
Alert here)).

>Questions: (1) are all 1984-89 Carrera wheels made so that the extra width
>goes to the outside (instead on inside)?

Yes.

>(2) Am I safe that 225x50x15 rear
>tires will not rub on the oil lines?

Yes, but this depends on *your* car and the wheel offsets, as well as the
tire you run (Yoko's w/ their softer sidewall, rubbed on my spring plates --
not the oil lines, whereas BFGs did not).

>(3) Do I have to flare the rear
>fenders, even though the botton of the fender is about 1 inch above the
>tire, because of bouncing?

To get anything bigger than a 7 on you do, and a 7 has to have a deeper
backset (more wheel inside than outside) -- 5 1/8" seems to do it fine for
most.

> (4) will the wider tires provide a substantial
>advantage in traction?

Absolutely, as will a ltd. slip.

>(5) Are the wider wheels worth the cost - $1,500.?

The SC or Carrera flares are nice looking and you can stuff a lot of wheel
underneath them.  I used 911 Turbo 9x16s with 245/45/16 on the rear (5 1/2"
backset) and standard offset fuchs 8x15s with 225/50/15 on the front, with
the only mods being SC flares in the rear and rolled fender lips in the
front -- Oh, and BFG R1s -- they don't flex much.  Real Turbo 9x16s are
getting verrry popular -- so you might want to have some HRE's made up in
the right offset -- might as well do the fronts too so they look the same.
 Price will be in the same $1500 range not including body work for flares
and bumper extension mods.

Subject: Re: 911 SC Ring and Pinion Ratio/Tranny Rebuild

Martin-
After having done three of these things, I can probably answer your
question from the standpoint of a non-professional.

1. Can you do the repair in a weekend:  Maybe, if you have everything you 
will need at hand.  But it will be hard to know exactly what you will 
need until you get it opened up.  I would suggest a two weekend scenario,
one to get it out tear it down and order parts,  the next weekend to 
reassemble and replace.  This leaves out ring and pinion changes which 
complicate things greatly IMHO.  If you do this, you will need some very
expensive tools, or a lot of time, and gear marking compound, plus a 
shoebox full of shims.   

2. Do you need a hydraulic press:  I have done this without one,  but I   
would not reccommend it.  With gear pullers, hammers etc., it is possible,
but the possibility/probability of damage gets high.  A hydraulic press 
is a floor standing piece of equipment, at least it is if it is big 
enough to be usefull for what you want it for.  It will cost $250-350
for a Republic of China Special.  You will probably need about $200 in  
other tools,some of these can be home-made, but you might need some  
originals to copy.

3. What parts will you need to replace:  beside synchro's, maybe the 
dog-clutch rings and teeth, possibly some bearings.  It is not too likely
that any gears will need to be replaced, if the transmission has been 
well cared for.

4. As far as pitfalls, take very good notes upon teardown, label all of 
needle bearings and their races, keep carefull track of all of the detent 
parts. 

I know that this is not very detailed, but it may help you.  If you have 
any questions, let me know.

I didn't think had particularly good feedback either)  The interior was 
quite plasticky (if that's a word).  The seat was ackward, too.  Differect 
than VW's I've ridden in of years past.
     I fear that the Corrado and Passat may be the last excellent VW's you 
will be able to find for a while.  Although that 10yr/100Kmile powertrain 
warranty is awfully inviting.

Hi Bill -

The car you saw was that of Ken Mitchell from Roseville, California.  "NO
KONES" has taken him, his wife and my wife Teresa to several SCCA National
championships.  And, BTW, he is a Porsche club member (previous owner of a
914 and a 944) though currently without a Porsche!

Asad, Pumper fans out there,

If you have a web-browser, try the Porschephiles URL:

http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html

I just looked, and unfortunately, there is no FAQ for water-pumpers.  However, 
just being on the list is even better than having a FAQ, we have *lots* of 
dedicated Pumper fans.  Ask your questions to the list, and you'll get *Lots of 
helpful guidance.  (can't blame you for wanting a 911 though...) <vbg>

BTW, although I *love* the 911 (always have, since first sight of one on the 
streets of Wiesbaden, in November, '64), a 928S or S4 was my *First* choice.
My frau didn't like getting in and out of the 928, so I *settled* for the 911
(heavy sigh...Life's a bitch, and then you die...)

Neither am I, but I still liked it.   It's clear they are appealing to the
boomer crowd who is *probably not very knowledgable about Porsches*.
They are lookng to develop new interest from a crowd that probably has never
seriously considered a Porsche--not solidify existing support.

IMHO, forgiving the relative lack of action, it's a great piece of work
for the way it appeals to the subjective, emotional aspect of Porsche
Ownership.

YMMV.

Matt-

>I'm willing to personally do all the prep stuff I

If you do all the prep stuff, like stripping off the old paint, 
taking off the trim pieces, masking, repairing the small rusted 
spots, filling small imperfections with plastic filler and putty,  
and sanding, you're almost finished!  Why not do the rest 
yourself too?  Most of the cost of a good paint job is in the prep 
work, not the painting.  And none of it is hard.  It's just time 
consuming.  Your costs will be something like:

1) Stripper  -  2 gallons at $25/gal

2) Sanding blocks, sandpaper, filler, putty - $50

3) Primers, paint and thinners- cost depends on color and type 
 - $200 to $400 is a good guess

4) Wet sandpaper, rubbing and polishing compounds - $50

That's $500 or so.  If you can't borrow or rent a compressor, 
add
$350, and another $50 for a spray gun.  (You can get a very 
good gun for $40.  Let me know if you decide to go this route 
and I'll tell you which one.)

>Do I need to get this thing bead blasted?

Nope. Chemical stripper (see above) is messy but it works.  In 
fact, if the old paint isn't cracked or crazed or too thick, you 
can often get by with sanding it to rough it up, and then 
painting right over it.

>I would much rather paint it a darker color (like british racing 
>green)

If you go for a dark color, make sure your panels are all nice 
and straight.  Any imperfections show up like gangbusters 
with dark colors.

Subject: 914/6s


Lest all of you think I just play with water-coolers, I have owned 
the 914/6s, one of which was a 914/6 GT. I race the living p*** out of 
them. Time-trials, autocrosses, etc. 

That's what the factory built them for. It was stated "The 914/4 will 
please most customers. The 914/6 is for the enthusiast who demands the
normal level of Porsche performance for competitive events." 1969
Porsche advertizing.

There were a handfull in the San Francisco area that were autocrossed.
Rick Ford, Bob Zulkowski, Myself, Troy Powell, Bernie Buschen, Darryl
Overstreet, Phil Mullen and a couple of others. We did well. In 1980
they shove Bernie Buschen and I in with the Corvettes. We finished 1-2
ahead of them in the local NCSCC series. Dave Colman ran his 914/6 in 
the SCCA series, also winning. Then there was the PCA Zone 7 series,
914/6 being the preferred car in the zone race tire classes. 

Mike Willis and many others competed in the same series with 914/4. They 
were quite successful.

If a 914/6 is solid, there's no reason not to play.

You can thin it up to 20 percent for different (smoother) texture.

Subject: Sports Car Int'l 4 sale

For anybody who cares about the soap opera world of car magazine publishing:
 
I just got off the phone with a Highly Placed Unimpeachable Source. Sports
Car International is on the auction block. The magazine never made any money
for its new owner, Tom Toldrian, who also owns Excellence and a woodworking
magazine. Toldrian fired the editor who had made the magazine what it was,
Mark Ewing, and hired some kid who worked for a lower salary. The ad page
count kept dropping, the magazine got thinner and the articles were less
interesting for a broader base of readers. Now he just wants out from under.
 
When the original owner of SCI, a printer in the Chicago suburbs, wanted
out, I personally drove up to the Bay Area and got Toldrian interested in
acquiring SCI for his magazine "empire." I figured I did most of my testing
and writing for them, so if a new, friendly owner had it, my future as a
freelancer was assured. That worked, until he fired editor Mark Ewing.
Admittedly Ewing was difficult to get along with, but damn, he knew cars and
he knew car people and put together a beautiful book at the end. The new kid
thinks sports cars must be British, that's all he knows. He doesn't think
testing is important, and they go for the cheapest writers and shooters they
can find. When I stopped writing for Toldrian's magazines, I wished that he
would choke on the magazine that I talked him into buying.
 
I am now very happy to say that it is coming about. And it keeps my record
intact. If we didn't part on good terms, no boss has kept his job for more
than a year year after I left. What goes around etc.
 
One possibility is that Hachette (Road & Track, Car and Driver, Saddam
Hussein) may buy it for next to nothing, just to get its mailing mailing
list, and let it die.
 
This absolutely makes my day. I'm going to take some of Bart's yellow ones
and terrorize the freeway. After I call all the other disenchanted former SCI
contributors who have similar warm regards for Toldrian.

Hi,

I'm looking to purchase a use porsche and have looked at a few and am 
tring to decide which one to get.  I found a 1971 911T with 146,000 
miles on it that is selling for $6,000 from a used car dealer.  The body 
etc seems to be in good shape, but there is a lot of oil all over the 
engine.  The dealer claims to have spent $800 on repairing rust under 
the car.  Is this a good deal?

I have also looked at a 1975 911 that was imported from Germany.  The 
owner says that the engine was replaced in 1979 in Germany and has 
33,000 miles on the replaced engine.  The car has a sportmatic tranny 
and the owner says that it clunks sometimes.  There is a lot of oil 
leaking and owner claims the main oil seal needs to be replaced at cost 
of $3,000.   The price is $5,000.  I like this car should I look at it 
some more?

Subject: What a weekend!

Well, we finally had a beautiful weekend here in Northern Ca.  Got to
take the car out for it's first long excursion.  Wife and self put
250 miles on it.  Went over to the Napa valley, took a few winding roads
and a few straights.  Opened it up and it really performed great.
Max speed 90 (safely), max rpm 4500.  Still only 300 miles on my rebuild.

Now for a couple of questions.  When first starting the engine, oil
pressure is about 5 to 6 bar at idle.  Once warm the pressure drops below 
2 bar at idle and barely reaches 4 to 5 at high rpm's.  Normal?

Second, the oil level gauge that had not been working, finally started to
work at the end of our drive.  At idle the gauge reads between 5 and 6 qts,
at 3 to 4k rpm, reads in red below lowest reading.  Again, Normal?
This last one has me worried, because even taking a level reading the
manual way (dipstick) with engine warm and running, I barely get a reading.

Anyway, I hope this weather keeps up.  I actually had the courage to drive
it to work today.  (No rear targa seal, but no clouds in the sky)

I had the EXACT same problem with my 84 944, except over time it gets WORSE,
I could actually see the water streaming into my car <yuck>.  Had weather
stip replaced, no help.  Adjusted length of the cone-bolts that lock the
latch into place, no help.  Went to a glass installer, no help.  Went to the
dealer - "Oh, yeah we can fix it, should take 4 to 6 hours at $85 an hour",
yeah right, goodbye.  They did put me on the right track, saying the pattern
(indentation) that was left on the weather stipping indicated that the hatch
was not sitting correctly.

I spent some time with foam weather stripping adding pieces all over the
place.  I endid up 'building up' the weather stipping by inserting piecesof
 round weather stripping inside and under the exsisiting strip, starting 3"
from each corner, through the corner, and 3" up the side.  That was 2 years
ago, and walla, leak gone.  If this is a bit confusing, give me a call at 212

Subject: Depressed

Howdy gang,

I have an 85.5 944, which I have owned since new.  It has ~94,000.  I
pulled it out of the garage, this weekend,  having stored it for the winter. 
I had changed all the fluids last fall, as a prep for storage.  I even 
started it every month during the winter, just to keep things lubed and 
to move it around just enough to prevent tire distortion.  Everything
looked fine each time a ran the car.  Per normal 944 aging, I have noticed
that as the car has gotten older, the water temp would fluctuate more widely, 
but never to either extreme.  I had plans to replace the radiator, and upgrade
the thermostat and fan switches per lower open/turn-on temps, this spring.  I
had the preverbial 944 water pump problems at about 28k miles, so I believe I 
have at least one generation of water pump upgrades.  At any rate, after a brief
warm-up, I took it out on the road.  What a great feeling...until the master
engine warning light started to flicker not a mile from my house.  Everything 
looked fine except the water temp.  By the time I got turned around, and back
to the house, the needle was at the bottom of the red mark.  I noticed smoke
from under the hood, so popped it.  I had assumed a hose, but nooooooooooo!!
The coolant tank was pretty much empty, and the smoke was oil leaking from
what looks like the bottom of the cam-shaft housing gasket(?) at the rear
of the valve cover assembly.  This leaking oil was dripping down on to the
exaust manifold.  SH*T.  No other leaking.  I pulled the dipstick, now thinking
loss of oil.  The color of the oil on the dipstick looks like chocolate milk.
SH*T again!!.  Anti-freeze and oil mixture??

Well, I am thinking right now that I have, best case scenario, a blown head(?)
gasket.  Worst case, a cracked block. 

I live in Moscow, Idaho.  Not exactly the Porsche service availablity spot of
the world.  Most all of the work ever done on my car, except basic service,
was done in Boise(300 miles south), by John Harris, a factory-trained, 
water-cooled Porsche specialist/expert.  While I could take it to him, I think
I would like to do the work myself.  I have a garage, a fairly good set of 
tools, the time and money.  Having reviewed what the `Haynes' manual provides,
I am thinking of buying the factory shop manuals, and starting the job.

A few questions first:

  1.  What is the general diagnosis of the above symptoms?
      
  2.  The Haynes manual says the head gasket can be replaced with the engine
      in the car.  I will be doing a compression check tonight, but with the
      high mileage, I would suspect that a partial engine rebuild might be 
      in order if I am going to go through the work of replacing the head
      gasket.  What other items should I consider replacing/reworking?  Valves,
      rings etc?

  3.  Besides the belt-tensioning sensitivity, what other tricky items are
      there to consider?

  4.  Does anyone know of a reliable mechanic in the Spokane, WA area?

  5.  Suspecting a cracked block, is magna-fluxing the best way to find
      the problem if it is not clearly visable?


Thanks in advance,

Bob W.

Tom-

Glad it's working so well.  I'm at about 300 miles too,
but haven't pushed it beyond 65 and about 4000.  I'm 
sneaking up on it...

About the oil level.  When I filled it up after the rebuild
with the specified amount of oil, my gauge didn't read either,
and the dip stick reading was as you describe, with barely
a reading.  I asked around, even asked Bruce Anderson, if the 
factory spec oil capacity could be wrong.  No one knew, although
Bruce did say that a new engine requires a bit more oil than
a normal refill.  I knew that too, but it looked like I would
need 2 quarts or so more, and that's a lot of oil to be hanging\
around in the sump or oil filter.  Anyway, I decided the dipstick
was the thing to go by, and kept adding oil till the reading
was right in the middle.  At that point, the gauge started to
read right too.  

I have the figures at home (am at work now) but I'm pretty sure
I added 2.5 quarts more than the specified 8.5.  (My car, the
'72, is unique in that it's capacity is lower than other years.)
When I do the 500 mile oil change, I plan to measure how much comes out.
Wonder if it'll be 8.5.  Anyway, I feel a lot better with a
proper dipstick reading, and if I were you, I'd add oil.

The gauge, BTW, will only begin to read properly when the oil
is all warmed up and fully expanded.

Your pressure readings are about the same as mine.  Apparently
they're normal.

Hi,
Does anyone know what production car holds the record for the fastest lap

I'm not talking about heavily modified cars, but cars as they come off 
the showroom floor. This would include tuner cars that are sanctioned by 
the manufacturer, e.g. AMG.

I thought the record was held by a Nissan Skyline GT-R, but a kind soul 
informed me that the car in question was very heavily modified.

So, maybe a Porsche????

Hi, Mark,
     
Very hard to find. Plan on spending lots of money.
     
As recently as a couple of months ago, I saw an ad for a set of 4 for $1500. 
Don't know  quality, etc.
     
They should fit on your 88 Turbo, but you will have to roll the lips of the 
rear fender in order for your tires to clear.
     
Good luck

    Probably not.  I just painted my roommate's car in my driveway last
year.  Of course, it was a '78 Impala, so he didn't care much. But he
was very happy with the results, most of the problems that arose were
because I was using metallic paint (watch those stripes!  Makes it hard
to make the finish "flow" - the metallic part starts to run long before
the paint does.) and because I was using a cheap spray gun (there's one
drip from the spray gun on the back fender - doh!)
    If you stick to solid color paint and use a good gun, should be no
problem.  Do it in the morning, right after the mist rises.  Use a tack
rag to get the dust off.  Make sure you're using the proper reducer for
the temperature you're spraying in.  Practice first, too...

good luck,

Nate

PS- I have had good results with catalyzed acrylic enamel from both PPG
and some other company that I forget... if we're talking p-cars here,
you might want to go with Sikkens or something like that.

Bob,
	No need to feel depressed, at least your valves are still all likely to be 
straight!
	The job you describe is best attacked from the top, i.e. with the motor in 
the car.  The gasket set you will need can be obtained from Rodd Sydney in El 
Paso, Texas who is a *REALLY* good source for genuine parts for about $110 I 
believe.  His number is 1-800-590-7770.
	Start by removing intake manifold and exhaust manifold, and fight with the 
allen bolts that hold the valve casing on, all as per Haynes.  The head comes off 
very easily, make sure you follow the correct loosening procedure to avoid warpage.
	You will then be in a much better position to evaluate the necessity for a 
major overhaul.  Make sure that before you rebuild, you do lap in all the valves 
and put new valve seals on, as well as replace the camshaft seals.
	My guess is that you have a blown head gasket, and if the whole thing 
didn't get too hot you may not have warped the head.

Happy spannering,   Jan

SUBJ: Scratches and dings

Well, after searching for a '90 C2 cab for a few months now, I've finally
come across a couple that I will choose between. One is white/blue and is
in great condition, except for a couple of things: top needs restitching
along bottom edge and there are 2 noticible key scratches (one on a qtr panel
and the other on the rear fender).

Finally, the question: I saved the thread a few months ago from Miq Millman
and Larry Reynolds about using layers of primer and touch-up paint to fix
a paint chip. Would the same procedure work as well on a fairly deep, 4-inch
key scratch? The alternative, as I see it, is to leave them be, but I would
see them every time I drove the car and it would drive me crazy, I'm sure.

The car also has a couple of small door dings that didn't harm the paint,
just dented the metal. Any advice on new/revolutionary ways to remove these?
I saw an auto show a few years ago where a paint and body guy used dry ice
on a car left out in the sun to pull the dents out. Ever heard of this?

I tried for over 1 year to track down gas vapors in my car with no resolution!
Finally, (after replace charcol cannister, rubber fuel lines, etc) I traced the
gas smell in my 73 by the use of a smog testing apparatus(sp?) to the
fuel vapor condenser just under the windshield in the front compartment in
front of the driver.  It had a nice crack in it.  I can fwd you the exact
part if you like.

No, but Stranos (800-729-1831, ask for "Arlyn") says they carry Zelenda. 

Another source is Assenmacher Specialty Tools (AST) (800-525-2943, from

 Fuel pressure gauge with fittings for CIS-E (VW #1318 and K100-5)

 A racheting/latching version of #H798-5, Hazet's version of the plier to
 use on those blasted radiator hose clamps.

 Pulley holder (#2084) and maybe wrench (#2079) for R&R of crankshaft pulley.
 Another list member knew a machinist that made the holder and got the
 names of interested members. I would rather go that route (cheaper), but
 if it'll be awhile, ...

 I've seen other sources (Techtonics) for the exhaust-spring-clip remover

Subject: Re: painting

Matt, 

Do all the prep work yourself as others have suggested.  It is the most time 
consuming and labor intesive part of the operation, and therefore the most 
costly to have done.  I also once had a car painted at MAACO, BAD IDEA!  The 
finish was so bad and so full of dust and sanding debris that I refused to 
accept the car.  The owner agreed to repaint the car in order to fix the 
imperfections.  

Be warned that you *could* easily end up with a contaminated finish (dust, 
pollen, bugs, etc.) by painting a car outdoors.  Keep in mind that 
old-fashioned laquer paint has a very short "open" time (wet paint) after 
sprayed which will minimize any possibility of contamination.  A laquer job 
requires many coats, more work, hand polishing, and is generally much less 
durable.  The newer enamels and Urethanes, on the other hand, have much 
greater open times, but they only require a single coat and no major 
polishing.  Enamels or Urethanes, however, are the way to go for durability.

IMHO, if you want the best finish for the least $$$, do all the prep 
yourself, and then contract with a *reputable* paint/body shop to "shoot" 
the car for you in their **spray-booth**.  If you do paint the car yourself, 
at least do it in a garage that has been *thoroughally* cleaned (de-dusted) 
and the walls have been covered with poly to protect from overspray.  

Good Luck!

Yes, but it also takes a 180 degree opposite mindset from the television 
advertisements - the ones where they show the car buzzing along the 
Nurgburgring, or down the AutoBahn, or the factory guys coming up with 
different colors for it (still my favorite). No new-age mumbo-jumbo, just good 
fast action with lots of oversteer. :)

Subject: 914 tranny leak?

        So the inside of my bellhousing is *FEELTHY*.  The pressure
plate on the engine looks OK, though.  Does this mean my input shaft
seal (whatever it's really called) is toast?
        When I was putting the tranny up on blocks, it wound up
being nearly-vertical with the bellhousing down.  Nice pink fresh
tranny fluid dribbled on the floor.  It appeared to be coming from
a tall hexagonal thing on the passenger's side top right next to a
hole into the bellhousing.
        Is this some sort of overflow thing?  Is it likely that the
filth in my bellhousing is from this overflow and clutch disk wear
particles (and other dirt)?  I would not be too surprised if I had
overfilled the tranny just a little tiny bit...
        Thanks!

Subject: Corvair/914 Lives!!! first drive...?s

Add another Porsche to the "running" list,
	The Corvair powered 914 I rescued from the junkyard is on the road!
All it needed was a clutch cable.  The engine fired up after I siphoned the 
old nasty fuel out of the tank and put in fresh BP 93, cleaned the plugs& 
electrical contacts, and sprayed carb cleaner/starter in all 4 (yes 4!) 
carbs.  Man is this thing LOUD!!! I made sure there were no exhaust 
leaks, but its basically a straight pipe.  Smoked a bunch at first too, 
but that soon cleared (put new 20W oil in).  
	I turned all 4 discs and flushed the system, and they work but 
the master cylinder needs rebuilt.  The carbs need it too no doubt, it'l 
be fun to rebuild all 4 :^)  It was funny driving as I could feel the 
surge in power when they kicked in one by one!  I also put in new trans 
oil and the 901 shifts OK if still a bit stiff.  The shocks were rusted 
shut so it took a few leaps over RR tracks to free them up.  I greased 
the bearings and CVs so it would roll better.  The tires are badly 
rotted, even "Tire in a Can" can't keep air in them, but they lasted for 
my test ride.  
	Oh, did I mention?  This thing has POWER!!!  The guy who built 
this thing was serious, I think it was meant to be a track car(straight 
exhaust, WIDE wheels, etc.)  Handling felt as good as my 924, but the 
body flexes something awful(rust).  I lost another fender flare going into a 
pothole, but it survived unscathed.  Rust was FLYING off this car as I 
rocketed over the bumps on a lonely back road(I didn't bother to license 
or insure it yet).  I still can't get over the power this thing has, why 
haven't more people done this conversion?  I bet its just as fast as a 
914/6!  It really goes!  
	Questions...Will the 901 tranny smooth out with regular use?  How 
do you tell what kind of carbs it has, all I see are numbers?  Is this 
thing worth swapping into another body?
Thanx for any help...

Hi Mike,
   If the charging system on your '86 is the same as my '84, nothing 
short of a new alternator will cure it.  A Porsche mechanic 
friend diagnosed my problem as a burnt out diode (at least one).  The 
factory alternator stickered at over $800.00!  He said he could discount 
about $50.00 to me, but I couldn't stomach that either.  I found an ad 
for Vertex (305.442.2727) where they were selling rebuilt units for $160.00.
There is an $80.00 core charge above that.  Installed it myself and it 
has been running strong for over a year now!  

Good Luck!

Subject: Rebuilding brake calipers (914/6)


Well, trying to get the 914/6 running again this spring I discovered that
at least a couple of calipers were sticking, so I decided to embark on
a great brake caliper rebuild adventure, and go though all 4 calipers.

Oh boy.

The previous owner (Hi Jim!) had replaced the rears with 911SC front
calipers because of the rarity of the original parts.  The good news
is that I can find parts and rebuild the replacements, the bad news is
that I don't have any parking brakes.  (I keep a 4x4 behind the
drivers seat for emergency use... 8-))

I got the first one off the car (right rear), and tried to get the
pistons out using the accumulated wisdom of porschefiles, first with
air, then by putting the caliper back on the car with no brake pads
and pumping the brake.  The later got the pistons to move, but when I
got them off the car again I *still* couldn't get them out of the
caliper. I thought to then connect to the brake line without the brake
disk involved and get at least one of them out. But then, caught up by
the Red Mist that descends when Things Don't Work The Way They're
Supposed To I did something I had promised my self I wouldn't do.  

I took pliers wrapped in a shop towel to the caliper, and tried to
move it.

The result, which should be no suprise to anyone who has had to free a
stubborn caliper piston, is a small paper weight the size and shape of
a caliper piston.  This one can't even be used as a paper weight at
the moment, as that it is rather firmly ensconced in a brake caliper
for which I have other purposes.  Sigh.

So, I guess I'd like some advice:

   Can I get replacement pistons?  Where?

   Is there a more appropriate caliper to use that is available?
   (besides having no parking brake, these require some washers to get
    things to line up)

   Is there some magic elixir to set my pistons free?  Torch?  Dynamite?

   More hydraulic pressure should get one of the two pistons out, what
   about the other one?  After one is out there's no way to generate any
   pressure on the one remaining. 

   Is there some way to paint calipers that will survive? (other that
   powder coating or the like)

   Anybody know any body shops that really *know* 914s in southwestern
   Ohio?  (car has never seen salt, but was a victim of a mediocre
   paint job earlier in its life)


I'd really like to get to some autocrosses this season (just sent my check
into PCA), but first first I have to get the brakes back working.

TIA

I have successfully removed waaay stuck pistons on 356 C calipers with a
greasegun.
Find an old bridge pipe, cut of one end,  braze to a fitting that will mate
it to your handpump greasegun.  Take your good bridge pipe off, insert your
custom made bridgepipe-grease fitting, tighten,and pump away for inside
piston (on the inside piston you may have to plug the hole where your brake
hose would normally connect; a correct thread & pitch bolt works fine);  for
outside piston, insert custom tool into place where bridgepipe was & pump
away.  Make sure bleeder valves are secure.  As the caliper half fills with
grease it WILL pop the offending pistons out...but it leaves a mess to clean
out....but what they heck, you were going to clean everything out before you
went back together with new stuff...right?
Good Luck.

clear.  I took the wheel and calipers and disk off and lo and behold, 
teeny little cylinders came rolling out, my outer bearing was shot-

When people first started talking about how hard it was to get pistons
out of calipers, I thought "yeah, right. wimps" Then after The Brake Job 
From Hell (see archives, about Dec 94 or so), when I *broke* a couple of 
pistons extracting them, I somewhat modified my views. 

Hearing about this grease gun technique was another of those "yeah, right"
sort of things. Then last week when I had occassion to buy a new grease
gun for the first time in about 15 years, I was reading the instructions
thinking "oh, right -- like *I'm* going to learn something", when I'll
be damned if I *DIDN'T* learn something. Your average grease gun apparently
puts out 50,000 PSI of pressure. Think about it. That should move
those stubborn pistons! 

Thanks to whoever first suggested this. I haven't done it yet, but I'm i
officially a believer now...

Hi all,

There was a little discussion on whether forged or cast wheels are better and
Pete mentioned that the new turbo wheels are cast like the regular 993
wheels. I don't believe that that's right. The new turbo wheels, according to
the French Christophorus of 2/95, are rather exotic.  The 5 spokes are hollow
and made out of some special forged aluminum alloy which permit a weight
savings of around 3kg (7.5lbs) per wheel. BTW, the fronts are 8 x 18 and the
rears 10 x 18.  They are also the first wheels for production cars to be
friction welded, or as written in French  "soudage par friction." My
technical French isn't that good so if somebody wants to explain what it is
please tell me. 

The article also goes on to explain the Porsche engineers used weight saving
materials in other areas to increase performance as well as fuel economy.
 Great car.

myself, so I realize it is not an impossible task, and my Urban
Assault Vehicle ('87 Toyota 4Runner with big mud tires) needs
paint badly.  If I could paint it myself, buying the tools and

rather have a paint job and the compressor, paint equip, etc than
just a paint job...

Actually, what I've done was to use drop cloths (the plastic kind),
duct tape, a staple gun, and a fan for ventilation to build a "paint
booth" in my garage.  The real trick was to add enough lights around 
to see what you're doing!  For the equipment, my dad had it all (ok,
so the spray gun was a xmas gift from me a few years back, but he
_was_ thinking of painting his truck at the time...8-) ), so I didn't
end up with a compressor, but that allowed for a little higher quality
paint.   The only place I wasn't really happy with the finished job on
my 914 was the inside side of the front fenders right next to the turn
indicators.  You see them, but you don't think about getting a good
angle on those; the targa bar, you think about a lot.

The paint job wasn't perfect, but for <$170 it wasn't bad (well, there
are some on the list who have actually seen the car...), but I am the
owner. 8-)

What about those hydraulic parking brake valves I've heard about here
and there?  Patrick Motorsports sells them for $49.  I don't know if that's
good or bad or if it includes everything you need.  Are these things safe?
I wouldn't mind having 911 binders on all 4 corners of my 914 if I could
do it and still have some sort of e-brake - and not the 4x4 type!  :-)

  At least Nissan said "it was the same as prodction car and we only put 
  the optional parts(oil cooler) on it, not modified". 

  But true is not. One Japanese famous monthly motor video "Best Motoring"
  reported the differrence between nomal production car and commercial
  car(which leased from Nissan). The difference is as follows;

                a)Height(-15mm)
                b)Camber angle(1.0 degree negative)
                c)Oil cooler
                d)Power(may be boost up)

  The difference of the performance is incredibly large. On the circuit,
  the nomal production car had some problems (higher oil temperature,
  fading out of brake etc.) and it's lap time got slower.

  Most important thing is that many car magazine and featured video 
  products reported only using this modified car and by now most of these
  Japanese commercial car had some modifying. So the editor of "Best 
  Mortoring" wanted to warn these ugly custom.

  But is this case popular in world wide? I heard that in nardo circuit
  the maximum speed chalenge event was held and the attendants(Ruf CTR,
  959, F40) which supplied from constructers was all modified for higher
  top speed achievement.

  I think even the new 993 turbo can't break the records.

Subject: 928 wandering - Toe-in?

	I can't take it anymore. We have a '91 928S4 that does not track very
well. The expressway here (the main road in the Vail valley!) is developing ruts
and the 928 just wants to go its own way when trying to drive on it. It is a
constant battle keeping the car going straight. This is also true on other roads
to a lesser degree. I have checked the toe-in (using a guage I bought from
LongAcre for my race car) and there is about 1/8" in the front and 1/16" (or
maybe a little less) in the rear. That is measured at the outside diameter of
the tires (about 24"). Does anyone know how much is desirable for the 928? The
factory manual says 15' in the front and 10' in the rear. Am I right that this
is about about .12" in the front (distance between rear of tire treads minus
distance between front of tire treads) and .08" in the rear?
	I know that low profile, wide tires have more problems with tracking, but
my 993 with 17" wheels and lower profile tires track wonderfully! Can anyone
help?
	Also, it is time to replace the tires. Are there brands of tires that
track better than other brands?

Subject: Problem with mounting 914-4 rear wheels

I have a question about mounting the _rear_ wheels on a 914-4 ('74 2.0). I
have factory Fuchs alloys with 195/50 VR15's. Perhaps someone has some
insight ...

The short of it is that I have difficulty getting the rear wheels properly
centered on the rear hub/rotors.  They often end up noticeably off-center
(I'm guessing .020" - .050" ), and this is very noticeable at highway
speeds.  There's nothing wrong with the wheels themselves - they're well
balanced and straight.  The fronts are fine and mount perfectly each time. 

The only way I've found to get around this is to use a dial indicator and
make lots of attempts at gradually tightening the wheel bolts until things
are well centered.  Needless to say, this is very tiresome and
time-consuming.

Is there some trick to guarantee proper hub-centric mounting of the rear
wheels on these cars? This is the only car I've ever encountered that
doesn't have hubs/rotors that guarantee hubcentric wheel mounting.

Thanks

Subject: Help: 2.4S pistons/cylinders

Sujet de l'lment: /.../016lbuj
Hi All P-philers,

   I need help to identify the pistons for my '72S engine. I need to replace
   2 cylinders (water damage) and 1 piston (wear). I bought 2 P/C from
   Performance Wholesale that seemed to match mine: 
   My piston markings:  83.95  
                        711E060  (small letters)
                     ** overall height: 2 7/8" (approx.)
                     ** 4 holes in the oil ring grooves, each side
   Received pistons:    83.96    
                        13E051  (small letters)
                     ** overall height: 3 1/8" (approx.)
                     ** 3 holes in the oil ring grooves, each side
   My cylinder:         triangle 6
                        708E073 (small letters)
                     ** O
                     ** 84ZD3                                         
  Received cylinder:    triangle 6
                        711E050 (small letters)
                     ** 3
                     ** 84ZD2
 As you can see, the pistons don't match at all. As for the cylinders, 
 they seem to be allright, but for the numbers that don't match. (3 is not 
 in the Tech. Spec. Books: is this a special type?)
 My worn piston has a diameter .4mm less than the others, 83.52 vs 83.92mm.
 
 Questions: Can anyone confirm that MY pistons are the right ones for a '72S,
            ie, they send me some non-standard P/C.?
            Anyone has a good piston?
 
 The left camshaft has #901105183.0R on it. This for a 2.4S, right?

for a while and said the driver was having the time of his life! I am pretty
sure we will be seeing him come out again.

I expected one other 356 on Saturday. It had to stay home, as it's caretakers
had to go dig out their mountain home from all the recent  snow in the local
mountains. 

The couple I was expecting have 2 356's, one is a coupe, the other a roadster.
 They take them everywhere, in all weather, to play. Just one more
testimonial to the durablity of the 356.

  I own '93 carrera2 with sunroof and have same problem. Actually I bought
  RECARO SP-G and not using RECARO genuin base frame but RS genuin seat
  rail to solve this. By doing so, I got about 5cm low downed hip point.

  I don't know whether you can use 964 RS seat rail(in fact, it the same
  as 928 seat rail) and RECARO genuin base frame make your hip point up.
  If you can get the custom mount, I recommend you RECARO SP-G.

  If you would like to know more information about this, please E-mail me.

Subject: Blue smoke from 911

During my on-going search for "my first 911", I came across a European '85 911
with 37K miles.  All appeared to be in order: clean, well cared for, full
maintenance records.  There were only a couple of things (besides the price$$)
that caused me concern:

   1) During a cold start, the car produced a healthy size (volume
      approx the size of the car) cloud of light blue smoke.  Is
      this normal for a 10 year old car with 37K miles?  The smoke
      did not continue for more than 5-7 seconds after startup.
      Should any car blow blue smoke, even if it is only for a few
      seconds?  Doesn't that indicate some kind of internal problem?
      Or can oil seep past the rings if the car is not driven for a
      period of time?
   2) There was a slight oil leak, from where I don't know, but
      the bottom part of the engine was "wet" by the end of our
      20 minute drive.  Owner said it was probably the oil pressure
      sensor or something near there (a simple fix) but could not
      confirm the exact location.  There was not much oil on the 
      floor where the car had been stored.
   3) Although I only have 1 other 911 (a 91) to compare to,
      the shifting action appeared to be rougher than normal getting
      it into 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.  Are all 911s gearboxes a struggle?
      Are the European gearboxes any different from the domestic?
      More or less problematic?

Are any of these potentially costly problems in disguise?  Am I being
unrealistic about finding an older 911 that will not come with any problems? 
Any information from those "veteran" 911 owners/mechanics would be appreciated.

Works great except for two things:

1) DOT and most state laws require a "mechanically actuated emergency brake"
   so that you have *SOME* hope of stopping the vehicle if there is a total
   failure in the brake system. This requirement pre-dates the dual circuit
   master cylinders that started in the mid-60s, but it's still there. You 
   can and usually WILL fail your state inspection without a real emergency
   brake.

2) the hydraulic gizmo obviously uses the brake system to "hold pressure"
   on the pads. So if you use it after getting the brakes all heated
   up, surprise! You now have warped rotors. There may also be other
   unpleasant surprises, like seals failing from being under pressure
   for prolonged periods of time (duty cycle is now very different
   that they were designed for...)

Well, actually, this has already been discussed. During the "T*d Wars", when 
he was attempted his first X-event, he took out several cones (plastic) and nearly
a live one, too. This led to the speculation that probably the only way he could do
better was to fill his tires with helium and float through the course. *This*
in turn led to the realization that knowing T*d as we, unfortuately, did, would
probably fill them with hydrogen instead (to get that 'extra' bit of lift) accidently
lock his keys in his car and watch it float off toward Tahoe.

I think you're right. I just read the German report in auto motor und sport,
they didn't mention the wheels in particular, photo caption just says "huge
brake discs behind newly styled light alloy wheels." But no, now that you
mention it, I did read an internal Porsche document months ago about their
development of the friction welding process and figured that it was about
due for the Turbo. And then promptly forgot about it.
 
Not sure how they friction weld this, probably spin the rim or the center
until it melts into the other part, but the idea is not new. When I
interviewed at GM Electromotive Division in 1978, they showed me friction
welded valves for their diesel railway locomotive engines. They hold the
valve stem, as I recall, in a high speed lathelike device and ram the
mushroom for the head into that until the whole thing glows and fuses
together. Grind the mushed out metal smooth, and you have a valve made with
two different steel alloys. Or maybe filled with sodium or whatever. (Is
this how Porsche/ATE sodium filled valves are made? Dunno).

Hi, Bob,

Well, sound like you're on the right track.

I would start with the compression check or leakdown test (which can give
you more info than just compression.

Mostlikelyculprit is the head gasket.

A cracked cylinder wall you will spot in a moment.

The heads are pretty stout, so may not even need resurfacing. Use the
factory manual spec and check with mechanics straightedge.

Subject: Brake Caliper Rebuild

 After seeing the discussion about rebuilding brake calipers
I thought I'd share what has worked for me. With the calipers
on the car I take my big water-pump pliers and depress both calipers,
then use a C-clamp to hold the first piston in place and put a piece of 
plywood inside the caliper so that the piston will come free but not 
slam into the C-clamp or come flying out. I wrap the whole dinger-doober
in a plastic bag or with a rag and take special care with braided brake
lines to insure that they do not kink. I then proceed to use a clean 
rag to clean out the piston bore and coat new seal, dust-boot and piston
with break fluid prior to installation. Many pistons require that they
be installed with a certant rotation as the surface that meets the pad
is not even. Repeat for the other piston. 
 I always use surgical gloves to keep break fluid off my hands but find 
that the break fluid tends to break them down fairly quickly. If 
anyone knows of a glove that will hold together but still allow you
to feel what your working on I'd sure appreciate it if you would pass
it along.

Subject: DYI Paint (longish)


I also paint in my garage, and also staple plastic from floor to ceiling
to make a "booth". A few days before I paint and before hanging the plastic, 
I take everything out of the garage (major job but necessary) I vacuum 
everything I can reach, blow off all the surfaces (including ceiling) with 
an air hose, then vacuum again. I let any remaining dust settle for a day, 
then staple new plastic tarp material from floor to ceiling, covering all 
the walls and duct taped to the floor. I put a muffin fan in a garage window 
with a furnace filter taped onto the inside so that I'm blowing air out. I
*thoroughly* blow the car off outside, then I mist the garage floor with
water and push the car inside and wet down about 10ft of driveway. I pull the
door down to about 6" to leave a little air flow. I tack the car and it's
ready to paint (all the paint mixing and prep work left out for brevity) I
use enamel with hardener which is dust proof in 20 minutes or so.

Using this method, I've never had a problem with dust. The dust people get
from Maaco and other painters is probably sanding dust that gets blown out
of door cracks etc. by the paint gun. That's why it's critical to blow every
square inch of the car off thoroughly outside the garage. I *have* had problems
with water from my compressor which somehow got through the trap, and I've
had problems with a car that had been Armoral'd to death causing trouble
with silicone. Even after using Prep-Sol and fish-eye reducer I had a few
bad spots. If you do get a dust spots, they can be removed *after* the paint
is dry and hard. It's always a disaster trying to remove dust or drips from 
wet paint.

This just covers keeping dust out of the paint. spraying technique, mixing,
masking, etc. also determine the quality of the job. There's no substitute for
practice and it probably shouldn't be on a p-car.

There has been some discussion about this recently - some to do with a
question I had.

Basically there is good news and bad news :-)

The good news is that you probably haven't got a blown head gasket. The
usual cause of coolant in the oil is the oil cooler.

The bad news is that Porsche recomends that you need to replace the big end
bearings. Maybe if you know that the water wasn't in the system before you
drove that car, and you could flush out the chocolate milk with good oil you
may be able to get away without doing this (eg drain coolant and old oil, fill
with new oil and turn the engine over for a while). This is just an idea,
based on no actual knowledge whatsoever!!

You may want to check the archives, as I said this has been discussed before.
The last thread was one I started called "944 oil cooler question". There
was a post from someone who had had a blown oil cooler.

Good luck!

Subject: Blue smoke from 85 911

 
Peter Rhim asked about blue smoke on startup.
 
Heck, yeah, they all do that (standard mechanic's excuse #2.) Every 911 I've
ever owned from new did it a lot when it was brand new, it got a little
better for a few thousand miles, then it just came back. It's nothing to
worry about. A few drops of oil drool past the valve guides and puddle in the
combustion chambers overnight.
 
OTOH, you can use the blue smoke to beat the price down. <g>. Tell the
seller you're worried about engine damage but you're willing to take the
risk for the right price etc.
 
It would be nice if 911 engines were nice and dry on the underside but those
are rare. A little oil is usually nothing to worry about.
 
Synchros, I don't know. The 85 would still have the Type 915 box with
Porsche synchromesh, not the Borg-Warner synchromesh used on the 87-on G50
box, which shifts smoother. If there is a clash on every gear being engaged,
probably needs clutch adjustment. If it's just a matter of waiting a
fraction of a second before you can engage each gear, well, that's Porsche
blocking synchromesh. There shouldn't be any significant wear on the 3, 4,
and 5 gear synchros, they don't see much action (even on a Euro car).
 
If this is a gray market car, make sure its DOT and EPA paperwork is in
order (compliance with emissions and safety regs). Otherwise you have a
potential major problem on your hands. Gray market cars typically sell for
less on the market because of this, but it doesn't make them bad cars. Just
be aware that someday you'll want to sell it again and it will be worth a
little less than an otherwise identical U.S. car. On the plus side, if it is
originally a non-catalyst Euro engine, you have higher compression ratio and
potentially more power. See below.
 
How much time did it spend in Europe before coming here? Europeans had a
tendency to beat the hell out of cars and then sell them to the gray
marketers, who got top dollar for them in the mid to late 80s during the
craziness.
 
You should have a Type 930/20 engine with 231 horsepower (DIN hp), without
catalyst. If you have a tacked-on catalyst, which the 930/20 never had from
the factory, you may have a little less power than that
but that is a reversible process. Depends also on what, if anything, the
gray market converter did to the DME box. The Type 930/20 has a 10.3:1
compression ratio. If you have a build sheet or dealer window sticker or
something, check for option code M298, which was optional for environmentally
nervous Germans and mandatory for Austria, Australia, and Switzerland. This
automatically gives you the U.S. engine, type M930/21, with a compression of
only 9.5 to 1 and only 207 hp DIN and factory standard catalyst.
 
The engine type is stamped into the crankcase. Don't recall where, but if
you find it you can confirm what this used to be. It is unlikely that the
car had lower compression pistons installed just to convert it; you probably
still have whatever it left the factory with. Be aware that the 10.3:1
compression called for 98 Research Octane fuel (which would be about 93-94
pump octane in the U.S.). The 930/20 did not have a knock sensor. Not sure
about 930/21 but it is unlikely it had a knock sensor either. So if you have
a 930/20 engine, hopefully somebody dialed the timing back a bit to keep it
from detonating on the fuel we have here.
 
Brain boxes:
the following DME brain boxes were listed for 1987, unlikely they are
applicable for 1985 but here they are anyway:
 
911.618.111.12   high compression engines, worldwide
911.618.111.13   low octane fuel (Belgium, France, Greece)
911.618.111.14   USA, California, Japan, Canada, Austria, Switzerland, rest
                 of world with catalyst
911.618.111.15   high compression engines with "Sports Package I."
911.618.111.16   low octane fuel with "Sports Package I."
911.618.111.17   USA etc. with "Sports Package I."
 
I think the brain box is located under the passenger seat. Maybe slide seat
and see if you can read the number on the box. If you find these at swap
meets, now you know what they are, and they are probably a plug-in
replacement for yours (same engine type after all).
 
Most of the above info comes from the forthcoming book "Porsche 911: Forever
Young" by Tobias Aichele. I translated it, Aichele works in the factory PR
department, and all the tech stuff was condensed for the book by my former
next door neighbor in Weissach who did technical training so it's factory
gospel.

Having gone both of these routes (stripper and plastic bead blasting) on 
my last two projects, I can tell you it really pays to go with the bead 
blasting if you want it done right.  With cars this old, they often have 
4 or 5 coats of paint on them.  When you use stripper it takes forever 
and you will end up using several gallons (at $20 each).  In contrast the 
bead blasting leaves the car looking perfect (no paint left in cracks the 
stripper would lift out) and saves your hours of time...lots of hours.  
Your hands will also thank you for having the car bead blasted.  If you 
use the stripper, make sure you wear heany gloves.

If you're in So. Cal. I would recommend Speed Strip in Glendale/Burbank.  
Talk to Scott.  He knows his stuff and has done several 914s.

If you go with the DIY method, wear a respirator.  Breathing all that 
crap will ruin you lungs...trust me on that one.

I have had experience with one organization called "The Dent Wizard" in
Leonia, NJ (201) 461-7766.  I have had as well as seen numerous dents removed
from many Porsches.  If the dent is not creased and the paint is intact,
their system does a beautiful job.  These people take pride in their work and
will tell you up front if they can or can not help. 

I have a customer who was shot in the door of his black 930 with a paintball.
 We cleaned up the paint and found that the impact had left a small dent in
the door.  He took the car to Dent Wizard and 30 minutes later drove home
with a perfect door.  

I can only speak for this one organization.  Their system (a combination
black magic and voodoo - they won't tell you what it is) works.  The key to
any service oriented business is to talk to the people and determine the
level of pride in their work.  

For what it's worth, that's my $ 0.000002 worth.

Subject: RE: parts for '87 944S

Ike,

Two things.  Your 944S self-tensioner spring isn't a likely candidate 
for failure.  What makes you feel it is weak?  If you lossen up the two 
other 13mm bolts on that assembly and place a 17mm wrench on the 
tensioner roller's nut, some pressure downwards with your forearm 
straight to your chest should be all you need to compress it.  I've seen 
only 3 of these assemblies, they took about the same effort.  I hope 
this isn't a part you'll need.  I'm not sure, but think the S2 
assembly's compatability with the S's should be considered (same width 
etc).

Replacing tensioner rollers on these and the S2 cars was recomended to 
me.  I also noticed how, because the original was plastic and its 
replacement metal, the outside edge begins to taper with milage causing 
uneven belt wear on these 16v belts. A relatively small amount of taper 
was beggining to show at 70k, for reference.  The metal replacement 
costs approx $45 (note: it may spin fine and still be bad because of the 
taper).  You can tell if you have a plastic one with a magnet.

Good Luck,

I ain't buying this (that the 914 camshaft is "slimmer on each side of TDC"
so that valve lash is greater on each side of TDC than it is at TDC.)  TDC
is just after the falling ramp of the intake valve, and a ways before the 
rising ramp of the exhaust valve.  In both cases it's on a part of the cam
that doesn't get any "slimmer".  And if there's any part of your cam that
measures *more* than the suggested lash, you have misadjusted, noisy valves
that will wear the cams fast.  Could someone confirm?  There's lots of stuff

This was a great time!  To all of you who put it togther, thank you very much.
I was fortunate enough to gett hooked up with the lady (Sorry, I can't remember
her name) who ran the fastest time in the morning session, she was fantastic!
She had that sweet 80 Waisach SC.

Anyway, the bug has bit and I have a few questions.  I want to lower my car and
have been quoted by Johnson Alignment (South Bay, Los Angeles) $275 for
lowering, four wheel alignment, and corner weight balancing.  Does this seem
reasonable, any recommendations for alternative shops in SOCAL area?  And
finally, other than a more bumpy ride, what are the implications of this set-up
over the long-haul, does it really enhance handling?

I'm looking forward to the next event...you guy's are great for organizing these
events, you could have charged more, but don't take that to heart :)

P.S. I'm a member of PCA/LA, just for the record.

Thanks for your collective input.

Some of you mentioned using the proper bolts.

The bolts I'm using are dull silver, have "rounded cone" seats, have 19mm
heads and are 62mm long (tip-to-tip), with a threaded portion that's 34mm
long.  Are these the right ones?

Dave wrote:

I simply
hold up the wheel, start one bolt (the long kind!), wiggle the wheel
into place so's I can put a second bolt in, and that holds the wheel
pretty much in place.  Two more bolts go on finger-tight, make the
first two finger-tight, then go 'round (opposite corners) with the
torque wrench.  94 ft-lbs, I believe.  About 1/4 to 1/2 turn each pass,
until the wrench goes "click".  No problems.


That's exactly what I do. Perhaps I'm not using the right "lubricant" on
the seats where the wheel meets the bolt(s) -- any suggestions?

Subject: RE: Depressed


Bob,

The symptoms you describe -- taffee-coloured goop on the dipstick,
are usually a result of oil and coolant mixing because of failed seals
in the oil/water heat exchanger.  Head gaskets rarely go on normally-
aspirated 944's.

Replacing the seals is not a huge amount of work.  However, because
you have coolant in the oil, Porsche recommends that you check the
connecting rod bearings.  To do this, you have to remove the oil pan,
which is a fair amount of work.  (On a car your age, I would plan on
replacing the bearings anyways while you are in there.)  If you find that
the coolant has damaged the conn rod bearings, you have to think
about also replacing the main bearings, which gets ugly...

With regard to your main warning light, I assume it came on because
of lack of coolant causing too high an engine temp.  Hopefully you
didn't run the engine too long in this condition.  If you did, however,
it is possible that your head has been warped.  In this case, it is
indeed possible that you pushed coolant past the head gasket.
But it would tend to be burned and show up as sweet-smelling exhaust,
before pushing past the rings and into the crankcase.

Hope this helps.

I had the opportunity to instruct at the Team Continental (TC) track
school at Portland International Raceway on Saturday.  TC is a local
racing club.  Some of the Porsche diehards hit every track day the
can including the schools.  My student was Dick Bader who has a
modified 85 Euro 911.  Eventhough Dick was my "student" he has been
driving on the track almost as long as I am old.

After 9 years of track driving his stock "chipped" engine lost a
valve.  They took it completely apart and the bottom end was perfect.
When the engine was put back together it was turned into a dual plug
3.4 L.  This was the second time on the track for the new engine.
I got to ride with Dick has his instructor.  The accelaration of the
new engine is incredible.  Dick would have to lift early (!) at the end
of the front straight because the car would still be accelerating
strong in 5th gear when the tach would swing up into the red.  This
was somewhere up over 140mph.  This was my first time in a car which
had more power than gearing.

Monte Smith was also in town with his yellow 911 RS.

Have you tested the distributor advance with a stobe timing light? 
The original 022 distibutor should produce a very fat advance curve 
below 2000 rpm, like 11 degrees of advance at 1000 rpm, 19 degrees at 
1500 rpm, and close to 24 degrees at 2000 rpm. Sounds like the 
previous owner may have advanced it to compensate for a distributor 
that's not up to snuff at the low end.

So autocross season has started, and I have this desire to get out

money, so I need a cheap fix (well, actually I've got some cash, but
it's all going to a new windshield--an unfortunately necessary
non-performance upgrade ).

I can't afford the good stuff, like autox tires and sport shocks,
but I figure I can swing some new suspension bushings (with labor
provided by yours truly, I can put a bunch of them in for about
$100).

Is this a worthwhile thing to spend my time and money on, or should
I just put it in the bank and wait?  Will I get any measurable
improvement in performance from new bushings?  Do I need to go to
the hard squeaky race bushings, will new factory stuff be useful, or
is there a happy medium?  Is the installation a complete bear, do I 
need arcane tools?

Subject: 356 oil flow question


I'm looking at modifying my case for an external oil cooler and want to
make sure I understand the oil flow from the diagrams and my case pieces. 
It appears that oil comes from the sump into the right hand side of the
pump, gets pumped out the left side through a passage and into the cooler. 
From there it passes the oil pressure sensor and gets distributed from
there, some to the filter and to the various other necessary places. 

Is this correct?

The design for an external cooler I saw had a boss in the front piece 
drilled for a fitting which, if the above is correct routed the oil to the
external cooler and then returned through a fitting which replaced the oil
sensor, which was relocated in the external system.

Sounds like the primary side of your alternator is bad, or the bulb has gone in

	Best way to diagnose: Measure primary resistance directly across 
alternator; if OK check bulb.
	If OK check voltage whilst revving engine, should be around 14 volts.  
If not check regulator.
	Alternatively take regulator and alternator to Autozone and get them to

The only disadvantage I can see is that there is a specified maximum time

clear-coat is applied.  I don't remember what the time period was, but I

Hi Reid,

I am by no means a Porsche expert but I'll pass on what little I know. 
The 924S was a limited production entry level Porsche made in 1987 and 
1988. The 924S differs from the regular '70s to early '80s 924 in that the 
924S has the drivetrain of the 944 in the old 924 body.

As for price, they tend to be under or around $5,000 (in NY)

I think that the 1988 924S is more desirable because it had 15 more 
horsepower than the 1987. Also, there were some special edition cars 
without power windows, sunroof, etc. (I think Bob Joyce has one, he may 
be able to help more)

Hope this helps, Good Luck

Subject: Fram oil filters: No mo!

Thought I'd share some newfound wisdom...

I have used Fram oil filters in my '80 931, against the advice of some
on this distinguished list.  My car runs high oil pressure: up to 7
bar when cold, with the 20/50 Mobil 1 inside.

TWO times now, I have found that while driving one day, my oil
pressure has dropped to 2 bar or so, and it does not recover. (Makes
the heart sink, it does!)  The first time, I suspected oil suction
problems, and so I dropped the pan and cleaned and re-attached the
sump siphon tube and screen (and replaced oil and filter).  Fixed it,
for a while.  This last time, though, I inspected the Fram filter after
removing it... VOILA!  The internals of the filter have separated,
allowing free flow without passing through the filter medium.  Hence,
blacker than usual oil.  I apologized profusely to my poor motor for
my lack of judgement and false sense of economy!  Never again.

I am a new Knecht/Mahle champion now, and I'll save the Frams to look
pretty in the store window sale display!!

     Hello Philes,

     My spousal unit has recently given in and I have now been cleared to 
sell
     my 914 and buy a newer 911. I have a few questions regarding this.

     1. What would be the approximate value of my 914 (6 conversion)?

     1972 914 Minor Rust in usual places, needs new paint.
     Engine    - 1967 911s Aluminum Case, updated with squirters
          - 2.7 RS Mahle Pistons, 2.4 Heads, Tilton aluminum flywheel
          - 40 IDT 3C Webers, K&N Watershields
     Trans.    - 1977 915 transmission, home-made shift linkage
     Susp.     - Front 1976 911 Struts, Hubs and Rotors
          - A Calipers, 16mm Sway Bar
          - Rear 1975 911 Stub Axles and Hubs
          - 914/6 Rotors, VW Bus C/V Joints,  140lb Springs
     Wheels    - American Eagle Replica Cast Fuch Alloys 15x7 Front & Rear
          - BFG Comp T/A 205-50
          - Black Inlaid Crest Center Caps, and Locks
     Misc.     - New pedal assembly, clutch, aluminum pressure plate
            T/O bearing, clutch cable, and accelerator linkage.

     2. I am looking for a totally stock car, that will be my daily driver.
     I would like to buy the newest Cabrio. that I can afford for my budget
     of 40k Canadian (~30k U.S.). From my glance at a few ads, I suspect 
that
     I could go as new as 1987 or 1988. Is this reasonable? Have any of you
     recently bought a 87 or 88 Cabrio., was this in the area that you paid?
     
     3. Have any Canadians on the list bought a U.S. car? Did you have any
     problems bringing the car back into Canada? Did you drive it back or
     have it shipped back?

The way to handle the dust problem is to use fast drying 
paints, and then to wet sand and polish.  Lacquer is the 
fastest drying - it's out of dust (that means dry enough so 
dust won't stick) in seconds.  It wet sands a polished 
beautifully, but is not as durable as other paints.  The new
catalyzed urethanes are out of dust in a minute or so, and 
they also wet sand and polish beatifully, and are extremely 
durable to boot.  Take my word for it.  You can produce an 
absolutely show car finish in your driveway.

Subject: Brake piston removal from caliper.



Pressure can be used to remove 356, 914, 911 and other pistons from 
the caliper. CAUTION should be used when pressure is applied. A grease
gun filled with hydraulic fluid works well as you can gradually apply 
pressure. There is nothing worse than a flying piston when it leaves
the caliper.

I usually have a piece of wood for the piston to slam to keep it from 
flying. If you use air, use a regulator to start with an applied 
pressure of 5 pounds, turning the pressure up slowly until you get 
movement. Tapping with a hammer on the housing helps the piston move. 

Unfortunately, when pistons freeze like this, you will usually discover
pitting from corrosion in the caliper bore. On rarer calipers, you may 
have to have stainless sleeves inserted to rebuild for use. There 
are a couple of firms advertising this service in Pano and Excellence.

I tried this dent removal process on my 86 Honda Accord last year. The car
had about 40 hail dents per major panel (ie. hood, roof, etc.). Some of
the dents were the size of golf balls. None of the dents had any sharp
creases. The car has original paint that has been beat on by the Colorado sun. 

I took the car to a place called the Dent Doctor and was given a quote of
$250 dollars per panel (~$800 vs. $3500 from a Body shop). I looked around
their shop (temporay shop since they tend to chase hailstorms) which was
filled with new Audi's in various stages of repair. The body panels that
had been repaired where perfect just like new (I have a lot of experience
performing show quality painting and bodywork). 

I was told that the 8 year old paint on my car might present some trouble,
but they would do their best. I was completely impressed when I picked up
the car, there was no evidence that there was ever any damage. He did 
point out a very small star on the trunk where the paint cracked due to it's
age but even that was almost imperceptible. 

From my experience I would highly recommend this process to anyone 
that wants to remove dents without any sharp creases especially if
the vehicle has fairly new original paint.

By now some of you have gotten the Early 911 Parts List.  This is a rough draft

If you've got an early 911 (SWB or anything up to 73) you should receive this
list.  It's a .txt file tab delimited so you should be able to table it in most
any of the new word processors or spreadsheets.

Drop me a line at INTERNET:73633,1772@COMPUSERV.COM requesting the list.  I'll

Last summer I pruchased some nitrile exam gloves from a supplier here in

they are quite a lot more chemical resistant than latex gloves.  Parts 
washer fluid attacks them very slowly, Perchloroethylene (NAPA Brake & 
Electic Motor Cleaner) will eventually destroy them, but not nearly so 
quickly as latex.  They seem impervious to oil and brake fluid.  They 
were made by Best Mfg. in Menlo GA. 1 800 241-0323.  If you can only get 
them in cases, let me know and I will speak with the local person.  If

I just did my 911 in PPG basecoat clearcoat, and before that
I did a 240Z, also with PPG basecoat/clearcoat, but a different
type.  I like it very much.  Goes on easily.  Dries fast,
can be wet sanded and polished if you wish, but can also
be left as is (if you happen to have a super-elaborate dust-free
environment, like the one you created).  They say that
it's harder to repair than one-coat systems, and that may be
true.  But the stuff is so hard, and durablem that you won't have
to repair it.  Anyway, I like it.

BTW, you really can do very well in your driveway.  There actually
isn't that much dust in the air, especially if you pick a
good day, and whatever there is goes away with a bit of wet sanding.
I actually didn't wet-sand the 240Z, and it's got a pretty darned
good finish on it.  I've seen many, many far worse, done by
'pros.'

at a bunch of 911's over the past few weeks.  (He

He's got one in the lot outside as I type that
he's very excited about.  1970 911 Carerra, Webers
(not FI), sunroof, about 3000 miles on engine and
transmission rebuilt by a well-respected  local
shop, new Konis, 7" Fuchs on front, 8" on rear, 
Dunlop D40 M2 (I think.  Tires aren't my thing...yet.)
Immaculate leather interior, and as far as I can tell
an immaculate exterior too.  Gold.  Oh, actual
miles on car 89,000.  

The engine rebuild consisted of new pistons, rings,
carrera tensioners (I think.  They might be standard
in 79's.) New stainless muffler.

I drove it and it feels very, very tight.  And 
peppy.  Has a lightened flywheel.

Price $17,500.  My friend thinks it's a good deal.  I

Subject: Paintless dent removal

 
I have seen paintless dent removal done. Done right, it is just as
advertised. PCA San Diego Region had a tech session at a local shop that did
this. By the time we got there, the inner panel of a recent 911 door had
been taken off. Two big dents had been circled with crayon. In less than a
minute each, the owner of the shop had pushed them back, and even when seen
at a low angle, and knowing exactly where it had been, you couldn't find the
dents. The paint was undamaged. One dent was very close to the side
intrusion beam. Dents which cannot be reached from behind can't be fixed by
this method. Seems expensive when you consider how little time it takes
(after door is opened) but consider the alternative. And the guy has learned
a real skill.
 
There is no real secret, just carefully pushing with the blunt, rounded end
of a soft steel rod. If you go too far, they use a piece of highly polished
stainless steel to push the dent back down and start over. It's not
something I would want to try on my own car though. Let the pros do it.

Unless some really radical new lego parts have come out in the last few
years, like worm gears with sort of regular gears on each end, you won't
be able to make one.  The Torsen differential is hard to describe in
words and it's hard to figure it out on paper also, but near as I can
tell it relies on the principle of worm gears transferring motion only
one way, the worm turns the gear next to it, but the gear cannot turn the

- --Boundary-7790243-0-0

Had some door dings removed by Dentpro.  I believe that they are are a 
franchise of a national chain so there's probably one near you.  They did an 
fantastic job on my Mercedes 300.  The techniques they use were first 
developed by Ford in the 40's.  Very simply, they have a series of 1/4-3/8 
diameter steel rods bent at various degrees at one end with different shape  
flattened, tapered ends.  The end of the rod may vary in length, 1,2,3in. and 
the angle may be from 45-90 degrees.  They look like something you could 
easily make with a vise. grinding wheel and file. 
 
They bend a handle of sorts at the other end and vary the length From 5" to 3 
ft.   They then drill a small hole(clearance for the rod) in the door jamb or 
body jamb nearest the dent, work the rod in and push out the dent from the 
inside.  Clearly, skill is as important as tools and concept so be sure to ask 
the person who shows up how long he's been at it. there's also a free standing 
vertical pole used for sighting along that exagerates the dent visually and 
gives the operator more control.  Overall a great process that was overlooked 
for it's simplicity for many years.  They plug the holes with little black 
plugs that look very "factory".  Go to your local Mercedes dealer, look at 
their clean used cars, open the doors and look at the jambs and you'll see the 
plugs.

Subject: Re: 356 oil flow question

Yep. Wasn't quite sure about the last part, but is your adaptation for
 street or track?
If you have a bolt on VW type kit (which leak because the gaskets are just a
leeetle bit the wrong size) - no big deal - remove shroud, unbolt stock
cooler, bolt on VW type cooler with cheesy -6 cotton braided lines, cut up
your nice fan shroud (since the shoulder on the VW adapter is too big) @ 3x2"
slice for lines to exit. Then find a place where you can bolt the cooler so
cooling air can circulate. Most guys put it under the deck lid grille, but
 be careful of pinches and stretch of the lines. In business - BUT - I think
this is what you're referring to....
I think you would be best served by a single chamber Oberg filter AND a small
to mid size cooler for street use. This is an adaptation of the oil system of
the SCCA E Production car I used to race a few years ago, and have
successfully put into many street cars.  This all fits neatly under the
drivers side rear wheel opening using the fender brace to mount the Oberg;
and the inner panel for a stand off cooler set up.  Recommend you use -8
minimum and preferably -10 Aeroquip lines with aluminum fittings.  Try to
keep as many fittings straight or 45 degrees or less. Each bend costs you
about 3psi or more esp 90 degree ones.  356's need every psi, so don't lose
too many.
To start:  Drill the oil pump cover and fit male threaded fitting. (you can
call ray Litz in CA he already has them made up) Plug oil pump hole inside of
3d pc of case where gears are.
Tap L side of case at closed bossing and insert threaded male fitting.
Reverse oil tube in 3d pc of case (can be done w/ stock rubber plugs in a
reinz gasket set) to block upper hole.  Remove stock cooler, tap and plug
holes.  Remove stock oil filter & store away. Plug hole in case with allen
plug (where oil line goes). And plug hole in temp block (where other line
goes). Suggest you remove oil return spring and piston from 3d pc of case
using only the one in the case with spring and piston.
How you run the lines is optional, some guys made holes in the sheetmetal,
some have removed the carb preheater horns and tubes and run the lines
through there - both work.  Cover your cooler with some screen in case of
flying rocks and debris. Think I got it all. If I have confused this too
much, please accept my apology - Ray Litz in CA or Vic Skirmants-356
Enterprises in MI do this for a living....they can tap and plug your case for
you, maybe even sell you a "kit" they put together for you to do the job
absolutley right....last time I checked it was for reasonable dollars

if he does this- if he does I'm sure he'd do a great job. Check your Pano or

Subject: re:K-Mart Quality (gasoline)

Bob356@aol.com says:
"... In short, gasoline is gasoline, and it has very little to do with
brands...."

This is partly true.  Most major refiners and their marketers freely trade
the lesser quality gasolines (regular and mid-grade) over the open market.
 For instance, if you purchase 87 octane gasoline at a Shell station, there
is no guarantee that the gasoline was refined by Shell.

On the other hand, most major refiners do not trade their premium quality
gasoline.  The premium gasoline sometimes goes through more rigorous refining
processes and most times has a better additive package blended in.  I can say
for sure that Amoco Ultimate (Clear) is this way.  It is rerun through a
distillation process to remove any color bodies to make it clear and their
best additive package is blended in.  Amoco Ultimate is only sold by Amoco.

This issue should not make much difference to all of us anyhow since we
should all be using the premium brands from major refiners.  So yes, gasoline
is gasoline, if you buy the good stuff.

apart but it

The mounts are a very tight fit into the crossmember. The mount has a 
bolt fixed to
the bottom of it. If it had a threaded recess instead, they would be 
much easier to
install. I had to loosen both mounts and lift the engine as high as it 
would go (until
the torque tube hit the tunnel) and unbolt both ends of the crossmember. Then
with a prybar to pull the crossmember down I was able to work the motor 
mount in.

You have to do *everything* the factory manual says. There is no easy way out.
OTOH, it is a fairly straightforward unbolt/rebolt sort of operation. 
If you check the
archives you will see that several folks including myself have relayed their
experiences doing the motor mount thing.

Porsche sells touch up paint that you can use on the rock chips. Get the

Regarding the paintless dent removers, 
In my klutziest of all time klutz moves, one winter I opened the door of the
911 too fast and it dented the side of the 944S which was parked alongside in
the garage.  (Seems it was a pure act of jealousy, as the 944S was slated to
supplant the 911 as the owner's number one driver).  Come spring, I had the
dent removed in Hartford at the Dent Somebodyorothers by a young man who I
figured was going to really mess up my car and the paint.  It is now 3-4
years later and I can't even remember which side of the car was dinged!
And of course two years later, while manuevering with my heavy briefcase
trying to get in the car with a cup of java, I proceeded to whap the corner
of the briefcase into the passenger side door -- major ding --.  Took it
right down to Dent whatzamagizzards and they made this one disappear also.  
Both cost me less than $100.  Neither have been communicated to lovely

Depending on how "right" you want the job, costs will be commensurate.  I
had estimates of $500 - $2000 to put SC flares on the '72.   I decided on a
fairly cheap job that included fitting/welding the flares closing up the
exhaust cutout in the rear valance, installing the used side bumpers I
bought (with extensions) and painting/undercoating all, also had the lower
rocker area painted and the non-S style deco trim installed.  Total for this
was $850 and the job is fair at best (I plan on getting the whole car
re-painted -- someday).

The flares themselves will cost you $100 to $250 (I got mine in a trade, so
they were pretty much free). Look in Pano want ads for these. You also need
to modify the bumpers with extensions, I think Twinks has these for $100 or
so -- installation (welding) extra.  So total for a cheap job and parts
might be a kilobuck.  IMHO I'd wait til you are going to do the whole car
and the shop will probably throw in some of the work anyway, plus it'll all
look "right" (in contrast to my "4 shades of white" car -- who cares, it's
faasst).

Unless you're talking an early E or S body, which has some extra value as an

Hi Andre,

944 clutch replacement takes considerable time.  My first 
and only time took approx. 3 10hr days (so, I didn't have
a life, but I learned how to do 944 clutches).  This is really
one of those jobs that will take the first timer quite a 
while (I'd bet the second time would be well w/in a weekend).
You'll want to have someone whose done the job whom you can
call, real time, when you're stuck.  The full proceedure would 
eat up some serious bandwidth here, but it should be available 
in the archives.  The archive is available through FTP.  Type
tta.com, get connected and search the porschephiles public 
files for 9-4_968.faq.  Oh, and also, don't make the mistake of 
thinking the factory manual and the Haynes alone are what you'll
need.  There are gross omissions in each, the only difference 
being Porsche AG suggesting theirs were, ROFL, "common mechanical
knowlege".

The going price for a clutch package (includes clutch plate,
pressure plate and throw out bearing) is around $500 (U.S.) if you 
shop around.

Yes, and, as mentioned in a previous response from Pete the going rate is
about $150 per wheel (plus shipping) for stripping, re-anodizing, painting,
etc at the well known wheel polishing/restoring services advertised in most
Pcar publications.  For this price, you get a wheel that looks original.

I'm working with a company now that I think can match the quality of the

At this time a year, television producers are planning for the new season
even as they are finishing the current one. One of the reasons that
MotorWeek went on line with Compuserve was to be able to get direct input
from our viewers, and those that might become our viewers. So, here goes.

If you could program MotorWeek, what would you show to entice millions of
car nuts, and just plain people that live with cars, to watch? Now, it has
to be car related, and legal, and oh yes, in good taste?

Really, given that we have to cover the hundred of new cars every year, so
we can't test just exotics, what would make YOU watch every week? Would you
change the format, the order in which segments are presented?

We'd love to hear from everyone on this. All of your answers will be logged
and considered. Even the corny ones!

Thanks for watching!    John Davis   Host Of MotorWeek

Subject: re: 911 oil tank bolt

Hi all -

A friend just called to ask my advice on repairing the threaded hole that 
drains the 911 oil reservoir.  Seems previous owner of the car had put 
some rubbery (my guess silicon) on it to seal it.  When my friend changed 
the oil recently he couldn't get it to seal.  So he removed the drain 
plugged again and tried teflon tape.  Now this wasn't to bad until he 
tried what he says the book says (95 foot pounds?) on it.  Wrong.  It now 
doesn't tighten at all.  I know the correct thing is to replace the tank, 
but short of that is there anything else like rethreading with an 
oversize bolt?  Does the hole in the tank make the threads when they 
punch the hole in (like turning in the sheetmetal) during manufacturing 
or is there a nut welded into the bottm of the tank?

What's the groups wisdom on this?  Any help would be appreciated.  And 
yes, I told him to recheck that 95 foot pound figure (I would guess more 
like 9.5 foot pounds on this bolt).

Okay, guys and gals (Hi, Bev), this may have come up before.  The Group 49

size and "limited" availability.  So if I get the proper brackets and change
to, say a Group 24 size battery I already know I don't necessarily give up
amps but I do give up a few pounds of weight in the front end.

Are those pounds significant?  Will a couple of free weights make up for it?

Subject: (long) 1959 356A - or how i spent my weekend.

If you're not too interested in 356s or stories of love found and then 
lost again, you may want to skip this one.

First off, many thanks to the folks (Denny, George, Denis, Peter, Robert, 
and Daniel - thanks!) who responded to my request for opinions about a 
356A I was considering.

The ad appears in the May issue of Excellence for a 1959 356A Normal Coupe
(technically a '58 i think); needing restoration - asking $5500 US.

General concensus was, given my brief description after speaking with 
the owner on the phone, that this price was a little high.  It was also 
suggested that there was probably more wrong with the car than just the 
floor.

I live in Montreal and the car is located on the Niagara peninsula - a
good 6-7 hour drive.  Did some visiting and touring and made a weekend of
it - the weather was great for a drive.


The person who invents magnetic bondo will probably make a killing.

The floor was worse than gone - it had taken part of the front of the
center tunnel with it, the "front pedal area" wasn't, and the lower side
of the sills (outer long.'s) was just gone.  This in and of itself didn't
scare me quite as much as all the filler I started to find - doors,
fenders, quarters, front end, hood (hmmm - some minor crumpling there
too...). Also the last bit of work that had been done was a pop-rivet and
braze job. It was enough to bring tears to your eyes. The interim floor
had apparently been a sandwich of two inner sheets, one flat sheet across
the bottom, a handful of brazing rods and too many pop-rivets.  Also, the
inner rear panels (interior portions of the inner rear quarters - not sure
of the proper name; basically the sides of the jump seats) were rotted
right about where the rear closing panel joins in.  Then I had a look at
the torsion bar mounts. Or what was left of the driver's side mount. There
_is_ lots of good metal in the car but at this point I started to hear
porschephiles' voices in ernest.  And, it was just plain more work than I
was looking for.  It was educational to poke around in the shell with a
trouble light as the entire car is striped other than suspension and
steering and harnesses.  And to be honest I'd never seen an 'A' in the
flesh before. 

This car has water-logged-interior written all over it.  The owner
confirmed that the carpets had been soaked when he'd got it. It did have
some strong points though - the roof was fine, as were the doors (other
than skins on the bottom) which opened and closed without protest or fuss.
Door posts were solid as were headlight buckets and most of the frontend
structure other than battery box. All the upper regions of the body panels
were in good shape too. The engine looked better than my motorcycle's 
'79 triple.

The current owner has invested in a lot of new metal, trim, carpet, and
even chromed wheels - he's backed himself into a corner rather heavily. 
He was busy pulling box upon box down from the rafters;  longitudinals,
jack struts, braces, pedal assembly nut plate, floors, diagonal, towing
hook (with rivots even :-), new hub caps, lights, chrome - it was like
Christmas. They'd recently moved into their house so he disappeared inside
for a while and finally returned with heaps of the paper trail, going back
to original factory paperwork. 


Alas, it was much more work than I am ready to deal with.  I am planing to
do my own work but the price he was looking for and the realization that
even all the new metal that the owner has purchased wouldn't fix the all
the serious problems finally convinced me.  The bondo and rivets hurt. The
car is certainly in a salvagable state; it'll just take more money and
time and know-how than I have. I have to admit though, not being from the
more heavily 356-populated regions, that it was difficult to turn my back
and walk away, leaving open the potential for another rivet and brazer to
come along...

Even in a poor coat of black paint and its rear wheels on tip-toes, it was 
hard to deny that wonderful shape... 

Thanks for your indulgence; and thanks again to those who offered opinions
and help.

And if you know an A or pre-A that's tired but still metal and looking for
a good home, let me know...

Yes, it seems to be pretty safe and easy on the coachwork when
compared with SCCA, etc.  To my understanding, PCA club racers
expect by and large to leave the track with their cars in the same
shape they arrived, which is probably less true in SCCA.

The 13/13 rule seems to have worked pretty well.  There are a few bad
apples out of the series by virtue of it, and I cannot think of anyone in
the series who I would describe as "an accident waiting to happen."
Well, maybe one person...

There have been equipment failures and driver errors.  Hard to say
which mode dominates.

While sort of on the subject, I would add that the quality of Driver's Ed
events here in Zone 1 has risen markedly in the past few years.  It always
seemed pretty good to me, to begin with.  But nowadays, even the
regions which I used to think of as running a little looser than others,
have improved the quality of instruction, instructors, safety, etc.  Which
isn't to say that driver's ed (or racing) has gone pansy-ass, not the case
at all.

p-philers,
Lately, my '73 1.7 has been giving me more trouble than normal.  After
a reasonable drive (greater than) 15 minutes, the car wont restart!
The car has always had a starter problem since I got it (10/94) (no flames
please, I know that this was a bad call ... now), but this was solved by
connecting a button which went between 30 and 50.  Now, even the button 
doesn't work.  I hear the fuel pump when I turn the ignition on, and when
I press the button, I hear a click, but that's it.  I can roll start it.
And, after a good while, (over 1-2 hours) I can start it with the button.
One thing, that I've noticed is that when it's giving me trouble, and I
turn the ignition on, the red light on the left (coil?) does not come on
whereas it does ususally.  The green light on the right (alternator?) does
still come on.  

Can someone please help me start my car?  I'm hoping to take it to Vegas
in a weak and I'll be devistated if I can't drive through the sunny
desert with the top off.

Greetings P'philes:
      Here's a question a friend asked that I couldn't help with. Said I'd
drop you all a note. Here's the scenario:
      Cherry 72 911T. Restored over a period of 4 years. Mechanic A has
problems with rebuild. Sent to mechanic B. Engine rebuilt, doesn't run right.
Sent to Mechanic C for F I work. Mechanic C generally considered very
reliable P-911 technician. Pump rebuilt on West Coast and 'diddled with.'
Everything's fine according to Mechanic C. Car driven a total of 1500 miles
in 3 years. Car on market. Starting from cold, copious oil smoking. Engine
compression good.
			Questions: Is this one of those situations where intuition is 'better
than' facts? This restoration sounds too scary to me. Too many cooks? Should
there be any concern with the rings not having seated properly? AFAIK there
have been only low speed, short trips since the rebuild. Lastly, *Used

Subject: Re: 912 No Power below 2000 RPM

Dear Scott:

       There are several things that can cause a lack of Power below 2000
RPM. First of all, did you check your High Speed Timing? It's all well and
good that you have 3 deg BTDC at idle, but what happens after that?
Specifically, what is the timing at 3000+ RPM? Is the timing smoooooth up and
down or does it vary or "stick"? At a constant RPM, does the timing
vary/waver quite a bit?  And  what is your distributor number (last three
numbers)?
       Second, did you adjust the Idle Mixture Screws on the Webers. (There
are 4, one for each cylinder.) Did they all adjust nicely, like  they should,
or did one (or more) NOT adjust- i.e. if you screwed it in allllll the way,
did it not change the running of  the  engine much?  If so, this could
indicate a clogged idle jet, which could explain your problem. Another way to
tell if one carb is the problem is to drive on one carb only by disconnecting
the downcoming linkage rod to the carb. Yes, it'll drive poorly, but oughta
get up to 45-50 mph. If so, then try driving on the other carb. If one carb
will only get  to 25-30 mph, try disconnecting one plug wire on that side. If
you pull off  the bad one, the car will run the same as before. If you pull
off  the good one, the car won't move! This is my Binary Search technique
that in two tests allows you to find the one cylinder that's bad!
     Finally, you might well have a "high performance" cam inside that will
ALWAYS be weak at the low end ifin it's strong at the high end! That's the
penalty for a "high performance" cam- you get lots of high end power, but at
low RPM you don't have enough torque to pull  the proverbial skin off the
proverbial banana. (That's  why I like the cam grind we've  evolved over the
years- it has good low-end torque, but still pulls to 6000 rpm.)

Hope this helps.

dealer last weekend.  Looked around the lot, did not see any 911SC's, 
then I asked the salesman if he had any.  He then led me over to a 
beautiful, metalic gold Porsche, to my suprise it had the "Carerra" badge

Well it pretty much went down hill from there.  The car had no records, 
the dealer would not let me talk to the past owner, and although he 
stated that he owned a Porsche and even raced them, he had not heard of 
the most respected Porsche shop in San Diego.  It was an '83 911SC with 
approx 90k miles on it.  He was asking 15,900.  Anyway, my friends told 
me to "just say no"  No records, no dice.

Then, today I look in the classifieds and almost fainted.  1985 911 
Targa, 3.2, mint, 70k miles, $15,000 or best.  My friend called him up, 
the man said it had salvage title :(.

I am getting anxious.  I have the loan papers filled out and ready to 
file, and once I get my tax returns (refund!), I will be set.

One further question:  Is there anything else I can do to help me locate 
my 911.  I get the autotrader every Thursday as soon as it hits the 
stands, I look in the classifieds every day in two different papers, and 
I've told all my friends to keep their eyes peeled.  Any tips to help 
this anxious process?

Subject: Re: 912 Oil flow question

Dear Ted:
            You were almost right about the oil flow in a late 356/912. The
oil exits the pump and goes first to a "bypass" valve whose plunger, when the
engine is first started, gets pushed "down" by oil pressure,  exposing the
oil passageway leading directly  to the bearings. Once oil pressure is
established throughout the engine, this bypass valve plunger gets pushed
"up", forcing the oil to go through the oil cooler. (The oil filter on a
356/912 is a bypass filter whose oil flow is controlled by the approx. 1/16"
hole in the bolt  that holds the oil filter inlet line (going  to the oil
filter can) to  the Junction Block. The resulting flow rate is not huge.)
       The best full-flow system IMHO takes the oil off a specially machined
oil pump cover, to the remote full-flow oil filter and/or remote oil cooler,
and returns the oil to the left hand  side of the Third Piece of the Case,
 where a soft plug has been installed by  the factory to plug a drilled oil
passageway. The soft plug must be removed and the area welded to beef it up
and drilled/tapped to fit the oil lines you are using. This puts all the ugly
full-flow  stuff under the engine and not up on top. The topside then looks
nicely stock, which is nice.
      Note however, that you must  also PLUG the outlet oil passageway
leading from the oil pump, or your  expensive full-flow filter system becomes
a bypass one once again! (And please note- use a nicely-designed plug to plug
the oil pump outlet- one that  won't come out and  take a suicide plunge into
the teeth of the oil pump gears, causing the gears to try to digest the plug,
which causes the drive tang of the oil pump gear to break off,  which causes
NO oil pressure nor flow, which causes  very rapid seizure of the  whole
shebang.  And she go SheBANG!  (There are a couple examples of just this type
of failure in the Broken Parts Collection of the Maestro's Museum!  Broken
oil pump drive gear tangs, and the wayward, poorly-installed suicidial plug.)

Slowly finding time to finish my '58 project. It's time to put sound

What I'm doing is;
Based on correct patterns I'm making 'mats' from tar paper (outdoor
quality(?)) 

I have ~2mm paper and will have to glue 2 similar pieces together. 

I'm planning to install one 2 mm piece, then glue a similar 2 mm piece
to it *in correct position*. This should ensure that the shape and
form of the laminated mat is correct.

I've also dug up somebodys  grandma's special baking tool which is to
be rolled over the mat to give almost similar (...better than none.)
impressions as the mats originally have.

Scissors, heating gun, patterns, halfmask with filters, and glue. That
should do the job?

By the way, any suggestions for real sticky glue for this job? Any
comments?

cheers,

PS; Thanks to Pete A. for a lot of the ideas involved with making the

Sensible or not, there are some British lumps for which the power setup
involves more-than-stock valve clearance. The power increase is measureable.
The explanation that I have seen for this is that it causes the initial
valve lift to be more aggressive, at some cost in cam & valvetrain life.
I can see that a slight increase in valve clearance just before takeup
might have a similar effect for a 914.

Rob says, "This is partly true...."

No, no, no, no.  I ALWAYS tell the truth.  As Kato Kaelin says, "I wouldn't
lie for any amount of money." 

"Most major refiners and their marketers freely trade the lesser quality
gasolines (regular and mid-grade) over the open market. For instance, if you
purchase 87 octane gasoline at a Shell station, there is no guarantee that
the gasoline was refined by Shell.  On the other hand, most major refiners do
not trade their premium quality gasoline...." 

But, then, a wise old engineering professor once told me, "When you use the
word "always", you're probably going to be wrong occasionally.  Amoco is
somewhat of an anomoly in this situation, Rob: you are correct in saying
gasoline with their brand is indeed from Amoco refineries.  However, you can
be sure that ALL branded gasolines meet the specifications for that brand,
whatever that may be, whatever their grade, and from wherever they may come.
 The point, however, is that gasolines sold at the discount stations and
convenient marts almost always meet the same standards and come from the very
same refineries that supply the big boys (yes, even Amoco's refinery...see
Stan's "Business 301" lesson).  You just don't know which of the big boys'
gasoline you're getting, and it may be different from week to week (depending
upon market prices at the wholesale terminal).

"...This issue should not make much difference to all of us anyhow since we
should all be using the premium brands from major refiners...."

Whatever strokes you best.  Using gasoline from a specific major refiner was
important several years ago if you wanted to keep your injectors and valves
clean, but today all the major brands have comparable additives (albeit with
some differences) so it's much less important to be picky.  That's good news
for the consumer, since what you get at the corner convenient mart is just as
good as what you get at the corner Texaco.

"...I can say for sure that Amoco Ultimate (Clear) is this way.  It is rerun
through a distillation process to remove any color bodies to make it
clear...." 

No, Rob, it is not rerun through anything to get it that way.  ALL gasoline
is colorless when it's refined, whatever its grade or origin...the color
comes from dyes that are added to differentiate grades for the consumer (a
practice begun years ago to prevent dishonest dealers from selling regular
for premium!)

Those marketers and ad agencies have got you for sure.  Run, run, run.

until the wrench goes "click".  No problems.

"That's exactly what I do. Perhaps I'm not using the right "lubricant" on
the seats where the wheel meets the bolt(s) -- any suggestions?"

Though probably not related to Andrew's problem, it helps to rotate the wheel
as you finger-tighten those bolts (or nuts, if you are mounting a wheel
having studs).  This prevents the wheel from being pinched "off-center" by
the conical surface of the bolt (nut) and ensures that it mounts properly.
 Watch your fingers, however, as the wheel shifts just enough when doing this
to give you a nasty blood-blister!

=========

I am trying to remove the starter motor from an 89 911 Carrerra as the
positive lead between the solenoid and the motor has corroded.
 
The trouble is that I can't remove the upper of the two Allan keyed bolts which
hold it on.
 
The lower bolt was not too hard to reach but the upper one is very close to
the underside of the rear seats - I just can't get the wrench onto it. 

Anyone got any ideas (bar removing the engine).

cheers

=================

Alisdair:
	I too found that removing the upper hex bolt was difficult. But, I foundout that I was doing it wrong!

I was trying to remove the upper bolt from the starter side. The best way I 
found was to lay right in the center of the car (after securely lifting the
car... Jackstand, etc!). I then wrapped my left hand around the trans (feet
towards the rear) to stabilize the wrench. My right hand, forearm, armpit 
would then go around the right (driver's) side with the wrench. You kind of
have to hug your trans ( Hey what better way to bond with your baby?).

Note, some penetrating oil should help in removing the bolt. Also make sure
that you are aplying torque and pressure at right angles. You don't want to
strip that baby. I don't know whay the Professor has chosen to use that kind
of bolt there...

And finally, disconnect your battery! One of the starter terminals gets juice
at all times!

Hope this helps!

Okay, guys and gals (Hi, Bev), this may have come up before.  The Group 49

to, say a Group 24 size battery I already know I don't necessarily give up

Are those pounds significant?  Will a couple of free weights make up for it?
Are there more important concerns in weight/balance front/rear ratios?  Will

As I finish installing a new clutch and put the motor back in the SC this

of adhesive does the almighty list recommend to secure the pad to the
"firewall"?

Also, I found an easy way to remove the bolts on the fly-wheel.  The masters
may not approve but it worked for me.  Anyway, instead of trying to remove 
the 12 point 12mm bolts by hand and ruining the bolts, wrench etc.  I used a 
1/2" air impact. (Ooo, ouch, ouch) I know it does not sound too good, but I 
figured the impact would apply much better torque and in the correct angle.  
While trying to do it manually I probabaly would have ruined the bolts, wrench,
not to mention probably have a hernia (spell?).

BTW, I will not use the impact to install them.  (Hah, Hah)

Hi Alan:

I had a lot of trouble with my '74 914 2.0 starting (basically, everything
would work except solenoid wouldn't pull in, hence no start, and ultimately
it became totally unpredictable) until I did two things -- put in a "remote
starter relay" GM-style, and disconnected the seat-belt interlock thingy
under the seats.  

The remote relay was absolutely necessary despite everything else being in
perfect order.  The tell-tale sign was that the voltage at the solenoid was
dropping to around 8 volts, and the drop was somewhere between the battery
and the "entrance" to the relay box. Since then (1 yr) I've never had
afailure-to-start.

Sounds like you have the 914 bad ground problem. Ck all of the battery

There should be a ground strap from the rear of the trasn the body. Take 
this off and clean the mounting points.

Pull all the cables loose and clean ck etc.

No matter where you find the dream car have it cked out by an

Subject: Re: Depressed


     G'day Bob,
     
     firstly, don't be so depressed!  I used to own an '83 944 and some 
     problems with oil starting to look like chocolate milk.  This the 
     "mixing" problem.
     
     You probably don't have a cracked case or blown gasket or anything 
     that catastrophic.  Your engine has an oil/water intercooler that is 
     located on the right side of the case, beneath the exhaust header.  
     The intercooler is inside of a small cast aluminum housing that bolts 
     to the case.  The seals (o-rings) that seal (and separate) the oil 
     passages against the water jacket harden and go bad over time.  This 
     allows the coolant to enter the oiling system.  You will need to 
     purchase the oil/water intercooler repair/update kit (includes the 
     latest seals, a green color instead of red and a new oil/water 
     intercooler housing gasket) to be able to repair this yourself.  I 
     ordered mine from Zim's and it was not too expensive.  Now for the bad 
     part:  since your oil already looked like chocolate milk, bearings 
     will have probably been damaged, esp. since the engine warning light 
     came on and the engine overheated, you (IMHO) will at least need to 
     replace the bottom end bearings.  This can be done (except for the 
     foremost and aftmost bearings, I believe) with the engine still in the 
     car.  I did'nt replace my bearings because my "mixing" problem did not 
     get that bad when I repaired the oil cooler problem.
     
     Hope this helps.  Good luck!

Well, I am thinking right now that I have, best case scenario, a blown head(?) 
gasket.  Worst case, a cracked block. 
     
I live in Moscow, Idaho.  Not exactly the Porsche service availablity spot of 
the world.  Most all of the work ever done on my car, except basic service, 
was done in Boise(300 miles south), by John Harris, a factory-trained, 
water-cooled Porsche specialist/expert.  While I could take it to him, I think 
I would like to do the work myself.  I have a garage, a fairly good set of 
tools, the time and money.  Having reviewed what the `Haynes' manual provides, 
I am thinking of buying the factory shop manuals, and starting the job.
     
A few questions first:
     
  1.  What is the general diagnosis of the above symptoms?
     
  2.  The Haynes manual says the head gasket can be replaced with the engine
      in the car.  I will be doing a compression check tonight, but with the 
      high mileage, I would suspect that a partial engine rebuild might be 
      in order if I am going to go through the work of replacing the head
      gasket.  What other items should I consider replacing/reworking?  Valves, 
      rings etc?
     
  3.  Besides the belt-tensioning sensitivity, what other tricky items are
      there to consider?
     
  4.  Does anyone know of a reliable mechanic in the Spokane, WA area?
     
  5.  Suspecting a cracked block, is magna-fluxing the best way to find
      the problem if it is not clearly visable?
     
     
Thanks in advance,

Subject: Speedometer/Odometer Error


Friends-

Now that I have my restored '72 911E on the road, I've 
found a few small, but annoying problems.  Here's the 
first...

The speedometer and odometer are both off,  almost 
exactly 10% low.  I've verified this with time and distance 
trials on a marked section of highway.  It's also obvious 
that I'm not going as slow as the speedometer says, and 
that my mileage to work can't have suddenly dropped 
from 17(in all my other cars)  to around 15 (in this one).

On the other hand, the tachometer/gear ratio relationship 
seems right on, in that the calculated speeds, e.g. 50 mph 
in 4th at 2900 rpm, seem to be exactly right.  Using this 
example, the speedometer would read about 45, the 
tach/gear ratio says it should be 50, and the highway 
distance/time test says it is 50.

I've taken apart the speedo, and it looks fine.  I've verified 
that it is the correct speedo for my car.  It's part number 
and the one in the parts manual agree.  My tires are 
correct for the car, 185/70 15".  This model also came with 
14" wheels in a 'comfort package', so it is possible my 
transmission has the correct speedo drive for 14" wheels, 
even though I have 15" wheels mounted.  But even then, 
the error would only be about 4%, and it's definitely 
bigger than that. More than twice as great.

Any ideas?  Thanks, as always.

     Hi Trond,
     
     I went through what you're going though, one year ago.  I found that 
     3M Super Trim Spray Adhesive is by far the one with the strongest

     I used two very light coats of spray adhesive, the heat gun to soften 
     the tar in the tar paper then pressed the stuff on with my hands.
     
     Did you know that on the Karmann built bodies, the tar paper had no 
     dimpling or waffling?  It was smooth.  On some Reutter bodies, the 
     waffled (and sometimes dimpled) tar paper was used throughout the car 
     and then there were some cars (I have seen one example of this) where 
     the waffled (and sometimes dimpled) material was used only in the 
     engine and passenger compartments but the material used in the trunk 
     was smooth!!  See if you can explain that one!  BTW, thats how I have

I've also dug up somebodys  grandma's special baking tool which is to 
be rolled over the mat to give almost similar (...better than none.) 
impressions as the mats originally have.
     
Scissors, heating gun, patterns, halfmask with filters, and glue. That

Subject: Re: 914 cam goes "negative"


Dear Dave, John, William and all,

Let me qualify. We all know that the base circle of the cam is uniform even
on well worn cams. However, with the multi-piece lifter pushrod rocker arm
valve adjusting lug assembly, lift angles and hard-to-reach-and-feel valve
adjust, it is easy to miscalculate the clearance, and when you turn the
engine over several times and things readjust and settle, the clearance is
different, usually wider. This is what we call "going negative" as what you
thought was proper clearance gets wider as the assembly moves. This is a
common occurance and re-emphasizes the point that proper valve adjust and
recheck is critical!

It is also very important to make sure that the adjusting lugs are in good
shape and that the pushrods are firmly seated in the lifter and rocker arms.

Starter problems (actually "cranking") are easily solved. Here is the
procedure:
     1. Make sure battery is fully charged, both negative and positive
battery connections are clean and tightly connected and transmission ground
strap to body is clean and tightly connected.
     2. Remove the yellow clip on solenoid lead and insert a test light. Have
an assistant turn the key to start. If the test light lights, proceed to step
5. If the test light fails to light, proceed to step 3 and/or 4.
     3. On '74 and early '75 models, move the passenger seat forward and
repeat the test light procedure on the large yellow and large yellow and red
leads entering and exiting the seatbelt interlock relay (they may have been
long ago connected together, however, by dealer recall). If the test light
lights on one side and not on the other, cut the wires and connect together.
If neither light the test light, go to step 4.
     4. Connect the test light to the large yellow wire exiting the back of
the ignition switch and again conduct the test light procedure. If the light
fails to light, free the ignition switch from the steering column and conduct
the test using a screwdriver in the switch as your key. If the light lights,
replace the key/tumbler assembly. If the light fails to light, replace the
switch.
     5. Short across the clip on solenoid male connector and the large
starter nut where the main cable is connected. If the starter engages,
install a Bosch hot-start kit. If the starter fails to engage, replace the
starter.

Remember, the above procedure assumes the items in step 1 are covered.

Additionally, the yellow solenoid lead wire sometimes loses voltage between
the ignition switch and the solenoid. Check the connections at the seatbelt
interlock ('74-early '75 models only) and the front and rear relay board
connections for corrosion.

Considering that everything is in spec., it sounds like you have a throttle
switch pressure sensor problem. The 2.0 914 models and '73 1.7 models are
notorious for it, the '70-'72 1.7 models occasionally. The throttle switch is
tested by disconnection. Mounted on the bottom of the throttle body, the
switch enrichens the mixture upon initial acceleration and shuts off the
injectors when the throttle is closed and until the idle circuit takes over.
The bucking is caused by a worn switch suddenly, without warning, shutting
off the injectors. By disconnecting the switch plug and driving, the bucking
should go away. (However, you may experience a hesitation upon initial
acceleration and a "popping" in the exhaust when the throttle closes.

The manifold pressure sensor, which looks like a hand grenade or small
pineapple, is mounted on a triangular stand on the right firewall behind the
battery. It senses manifold vacuum and then signals the control unit to
increase or decrease the duration of injection. The engine vacuum moves a
diaphragm in this device and the more vacuum, the more the diaphragm moves:
 High vacuum (idle) shorter duration; low vacuum (full throttle), longer
duration.

When the pressure sensor fails, the diaphragm usually breaks and engine
vacuum will not move it. So, at all engine vacuum conditions, there is a
longer duration of injection and therefore an extremely rich mixture at hot
idle. (You may actually find the car to run better when cold and at full
throttle!)

The simple test is to evacuate the sensor. If it holds 16" of vacuum forever,
it is good. If a vacuum cannot be drawn, or it leaks off, it is bad and needs
replacement. (If you do not have a vacuum pump, you simply can suck on the
sensor and draw a vacuum (like sucking on a coke bottle). The sensor should
hold your tongue without leaking! Replace as follows:
70-72 1.7 0280 100 049
73-74 2.0 0280 100 037
75-76 2.0 0280 100 043

Dear David,

The best overall tire size for the 5-1/2x15 factory wheel is a 195/65x15. We
like Yokahamas (and evidently the factory does also. My 94 Speedster came
shod with them!). This tire size fits the wheel width perfectly, provides
good performance and clears the rear fender wells!

Welcome to the club. 914s traditionally have had problems with wheel
centering and in 1973, the factory corrected the problem with the front by
building in a centering disc into the rotor. However, they never thought that
the rear balance was as important. Hence, we are stuck with slightly
miscentered wheels.

The proper procedure for rear wheel installation on a 914 is as follows:
1. Install wheel with lug bolts hand tightened.
2. Spin wheel by hand.
3. Put in gear and torque bolts to 20 ft.lbs.
4. Spin wheel by hand.
5. Put in gear and torque wheels to 50 ft.lbs.
6. Spin wheel by hand.
7. Put in gear and apply embrake. Torque wheels to 90 ft.lbs.

This is the best way we have found to center the rear wheels!

Mike,
I ran into the same problem that you describe re a leaky oil plug and

 My solution may not be the most glamourous but it is effective.  I approached
a radiator shop and asked them to cut the old plug out and weld a new one in. 
The shop had no difficulty whatsoever finding a brass replacement drain plug
and female fitting  (7/8" dia). They not only welded/braised the plug in but
cleaned the oil reservoir in their degreasing tank of all its 20+ years of
grime (remove the sender unit first).
Total labour and materials cost me $40.00 CDN and after repainting the tanks
exterior myself only a knowledgeable eye could discern that any work had been
performed.  It has performed without problems now for the last two years.

No. Those pounds mean nothing... in fact, now that spring is here, I run one

exactly tell you why they are not important, other than the fact that they
make up such a small percentage of the overall weight of the car. You don't

Subject: BIG problem... small answer? (long)

Okay, here's the situation... I drove the '73 911T to pick my sister up at
school today (roughly 1 mile away)... I sat in the 'parent line' whilst
waiting for her for roughly 15-20 minutes with the car idling... after all
the nervous worrying (I'm 17 and the cops were watching me the whole way,
not to mention going to an elementary school with a Porsche [They were
meant to be driven, but not mangled by second-graders]) I journeyed back
home (I went roughly 20 miles an hour both ways)
When I got home, I stopped the car in the driveway to open the garage
door... In my stupidity, I stalled the car in the driveway. The driveway is
slightly inclined. Anyways, I tried to restart the car... the starter kept
doing its thing for a short while, but didn't start the engine. I turned it
off, waited for a minute, tried again... same thing. I tried several times,
holding the gas to the floor one time, trying with normal pressure another,
and no pressure, and a combination, but nothing... I got the battery
charger/starter out and plugged it in... same attempts did nothing. (The
battery power was there though, all the lights glowed bright as ever and the
amp didn't pop the speakers like it does when the battery is nearing death.)
I finally figured that maybe it was a hot start problem and went inside to
wait and be pissed at the car. (I turned the battery charger/starter off)

After a short while, about 5 minutes, I went outside again and tried.
Nothing on the first attempt, then I smelled gasoline, so I intelligently
pressed the gas all the way down and started it. It fired up just like
normal.

This has happened several (5) times. All were on a slight incline, with the
engine below the rest of the car. If I wait for it to cool down a little, I
ALWAYS get the smell of gasoline after the first failure, but on the second
try, it ALWAYS starts!

Is this just some unique part of this car's personality, or is there some
fuel hose somewhere that is strange? I've been driving this car for two
years now and have had this problem on occasion, but until today, I just
forgot about it.

Subject: Brake disk slots

I am looking for information on slotting OEM brake disk rotors. By
slotting, I refer to a set of several shallow grooves in the face
of the disk, to relieve gas pressures, etc. A friend of mine who is 
taking the next step in track preparation on his street/track 1984
911 Carrera asked me if I could do this for him on my Bridgeport
mill, using a new set of rotors. I don't mind doing it, but I want to
make sure I know what I am doing. Therefore, I have some questions.

 - I assume I want a shallow groove with a round bottom, to avoid
stress concentrations. What size ball mill should I use, and how
deep should I cut? I'm guessing that something like a 1/4" D. ball
mill, and 0.040" deep (~1 mm) would be good choices.

 -The disk itself is cast iron, or at least something relatively
machinable?

 - I am planning to cut 3 grooves, equally spaced around the circumfrence,
with each groove tangent to the "hat" in the center and extending
all of the way to the outer edge. The grooves will be straight, rather
than the involutes or whatever I have seen on some grooves (the mill is 
not NC). Does the direction of the grooves relative to the wheel rotation
matter?

 - Is my understanding accurate that this is relatively safe, compared
to drilling OEM rotors, in terms of the probability of generating
cracks? (my umbrella insurance is up to date, just in case)

 - Is there anything else I should know?

I have to agree with Bob on this but also say that I'd bet even Amoco trades
for PUL (Premium Unleaded).  Having recently spent a stint with our refined
product traders, *nothing* is sacred out there and *everything* is traded,
bought & sold in the refined products area.  The main thing to remember is
that the additives packages are put in mostly at marketing terminals before
going to the final retailer.  The gas is pretty much a commodity up til that
point.

Well this is where we will disagree.  All additive packages are *not* equal.
 Different technologies are employed as well as concentrations.  This also
means that the effectiveness of the cleaning additives is different.  All
the manufactures buy or produce cleaning additives so they can claim the
benefits and get your business.  I won't go into my soapbox on why my
company's gas additives are better than the rest, but I will offer a couple
of testimonials:  Every domestic auto manufacturer uses Chevron gas to run
their assembly line emissions test (yes Rebecca, your new chevy is delivered
with a few gallons of good ol' Chevron in the tank), and Chevron's Techron
(Techroline as it's called in the gas) is recommended by a bunch of
manufacturers to clean and maintain those sensitive fuel and injection
systems; Porsche, BMW, etc. are among them...  You buy what you want, I'd
buy Chevron even if I *didn't* work for them...

Yup. Refinery 101.  Reniformers are run hard for premium and less hard for
regular -- Mid grade is a blend.  Which reminds me, Scott's tip for the day:
if you use mid grade unleaded in any of your vehicles (heaven forbid, not
your Porsche!), and your favorite vendor charges more than halfway between
the price of regular and premium, you should just mix your own in your tank.
 Around Houston they tend to charge about 3/4 the cost of premium for the
midgrade and you only get 2 octane points more than unleaded.  If you put
half premium and half unleaded in your tank you pay the average price of the
two and get 90 octane gas instead of 89 (our premium is 93, regular, 87).
 This is especially easy at the new credit card pumps...

[Text item: Text_1]
     Hi everyone:
     
     Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook recommends trimming the 
     cylinder air deflectors to (I believe) the 1977 dimensions.  Is this 
     still the recommended practice?
     
     Comments from anyone (including Bruce) are appreciated.

Now that makes sense.  The cam itself doesn't actually go negative, but 
the combination of all components working together after a few 
revolutions "may" widen the gap.  Thus requiring another adjustment on 
that valve.

Gee, there is sanity out there!

Subject: 1974 914 Seatbelt interlock relay


Our insideous legislators mandated that the 1974 cars would have an 
interlock to force people to put on their seat belts. The legislation
was repealed very quickly, but many 914s were delivered with this 
contraption. It was easily defeated, but the circuitry was left inplace.

This will cause problems, as George "Dr. 914" Hussey pointed out in his 
post. What occurs is that the relay resides under the passenger seat, 
interrupting the yellow wire from the ignition switch to the relay panel.
After a few years, the relay and surrounding wiring will corrode, 
breaking the circuit from the ignition switch. 

The total scure is to remove the relay and splice the ignition lead
(yellow) to the relay output (yellow-green, I recall). Be sure to use
a solder connector for this and heat-shrink insulation. I then remove 
all the interlock extraneous wiring and components, shortening all 
required wires to fit in the center tunnel.

If you own a 1974 914, it is well worth the time to remove this trinket
of big-brother's meddling. If you aren't sure what's there, remove the
passenger seat and look, the job may have already been done.

I met a few nice ladies with '74 914s this way. How 'bout you George?

You can do it 1-2-3-4 if you rotate the engine counter-clockwise.  It avoids
having to jump back and forth from one side of the engine to the other.

High everyone. I had someone come look at the 914 the other day. It was the
first real nice day. The guy came over and seemed a bit put off buying a
car from someone as young as me. Seemed to think I would have beat my baby
to death. Anyway after chatting about the car we went out to look at it and
drive it. What a great drive. The car didn't even do its weird FI thing. We
get back he looks around the car again and says I'll give you $4,700 for
it. Well the offer was good enough for me to take, but I had so much fun in
my first ride in the passenger seat that I told him I could not sell it
(the parents freaked at this point). Our new niehbor showed up a couple of
minutres later because he liked the way the car sounded. My mother filled
him in by saying 'this fool (me) wouldn't sell the money pit. I explained
my graduating from college no job lined up no money and loan story. He said
you should sell it, but I should have sold my plane to buy a house sooner.
He then said if you keep you can parke it under the wing of the plane in my
nice warm hanger. Free storage! Falling in Love again! All in all a great
day for me and frustration for the rents.

Hey everyone
Now I''m going to keep the money pit lets see what I'm into. I think I can
hear a rod knoock at idle. THere a tapping sound when the car idles that
goes away as it speeds up. Its only audible with head in engine bay. Now
here is the question. I know I need to rebuild or get a long block. Can I
risk another 2000-3000 miles without catastrophic engine failure.

Second FI
Current state of affairs
New rotor distributer cap throttle switches cylinder head temp sensor plug
and plug wires.

problem:
Cold weather 40 or below car starts and high idles fine. After 5 min it
will stall and die. Car starts fine again, but will die quickly. If revs
are 2000-3000 RPMS it misses badly. 4000+runs fine.

Warm car starts fine comes off high idle quickly and then will idle ate
950rpms. If left to idle 5-10 min car will start swing between near stall
to 1400rpms until it dies. The car will strat and if driven will run fine
but miss every ten min randomly. Plugs are differnt level of fouled if they
get pulled out and its never the same plug.
I have too ideas here. the car runs to rich at times in diferent cylinder,
but I have no idea why, or I'm burning too much damn oil and fouling
different plugs.

Michael Ladd,

*emergency* stuff.  Some of us can remember a rubber dumbell looking 
thing that you could put in a stripped out oil pan plug hole.  Try Jiffy 
Lube.  Locally I think that they strip one out every day.

I personally would sleeve the hole and rethread it.  Perhaps finding the 
next oversize thread that could be accommodated without cutting through 
the side.  Check the tank.  Mine is Copper plated steel.  Lots of 
different repairs could be made and then have the tank replated at your 
local plating shop.

Here's an aspect to think about.  I learned from my local electrical

The pounds were more important in the early short wheel base cars. 

Suggestion:  Find a battery with the proper electrical similarities that 
has a wide application.  Get info at Interstate Battery or Autozone, NAPA 
or the like.  The rest is fabrication.

The distributor in my '74 914 2.0 has a screw-adjust on the "outside" of

None of the illustrations I looked at in my various manuals (I don't have a

is not giving me enough retard at idle. Perhaps the screw adjust can

Hi, Trond.
 
Laminate the paper together BEFORE you stick it into the car. (Not one layer
of paper in car, glue, another layer on that.) If your tar paper is like my
tar paper, you can glue it with contact cement, that yellow/brown stuff used
for laminating Formica countertops and Ikea furniture and stuff like that.
<g>. Anyway, brush or roll both pieces, let dry, stick together (it will
stick instantly; no chance for fixing mistakes), roll out with a flat roller
(I use a 15 cm rubber roller sold for graphic arts purposes like
silkscreening), lay this aside for a day
to let the solvents from the contact cement evaporate fully. Then use a
stiff, sharp blade like a linoleum cutter or those triangular things, or at
worst those break-off hobby knives, to cut out the shape you need. If you
have done it right, you will not be able to see the two layers on the edge,
because they are bonded together and the knife smears the interface a
little. Next use your grandmother's roller. BTW, if you can send me a 5 x 5
cm sample of the result, I'm curious to see what you have. Now glue the
finished, textured part into the car. The factory way is to put hot tar on
the back and stick it in. If that is not practical, try more contact cement
or carpet cement.
 
(Later)
Derek Au suggested some 3M spray trim adhesive. That works just as well,
it's really the same stuff (again spray both surfaces, let dry, stick
together, roll out) but if you have a lot of area to cover it is much more
expensive than buying a one liter can of contact cement and using a brush or
roller. Also brush or roller will get a more complete coat than the thin
stream that comes out of the 3M can.
 
Adroplast (the name of this stuff) was waffled in every pre-T6 I've ever
seen. The T6s I've seen have smooth engine compartment panels. My Reutter T5
has waffled panels everywhere except the firewall which may not be original. If
you are doing a pre-T6, I figure waffled is fine. If indeed the distinction
lies in whether the car is built by Karmann or not, we should find some
Karmann hardtop coupes and look inside those. I suspect it will be waffled.
I don't think Karmann built anything (except those hardtops) until they were
given the job of making T6 Bs and Cs, beginning for the 1962 model year. You
bought a Karmann hardtop, right? So what did you find in it in the way of
paper, smooth or waffled? Engine paper smooth? Under the carpets smooth?
Front trunk smooth?

Subject: Renewing undercoating

 
Hi, Fred.
 
First get all the old stuff off. This probably means pulling the engine and
trans to do a thorough job. Maybe suspension too. Wire brush will probably
work best. Media blasting is good too but the damn stuff gets everywhere and
if you aren't doing a completely stripped body it's going to be an incredible
mess so don't do it.
 
Next, spray paint the exposed metal surface (ALL of the underside) with a good
metal etching primer. Du Pont Variprime, or similar (Ditzler DP-40?).
Aircraft Spruce and Specialty in Fullerton, CA sells genuine zinc chromate
primer. Nasty if you inhale it. Then paint over the yucky yellow/green stuff
with your favorite color of auto paint. Semi-gloss black Centari is as good
as anything. Imron would be super though. Again extremely nasty. Then coat
the paint with your choice of undercoat. I like Wuerth SKS Stoneguard,
available in black, white, beige I think. Stoddard has it, at $30 a quart I
think. It is also available locally at about half that price if you know how
to get ahold of the Wuerth jobber. Some
concours people like the 3M Body Schutz for originality on some cars. If you
want that, it's not as durable as the Wuerth, but you can apply it OVER the
Wuerth for effect. It eventually dries out just like the stuff you are now
peeling off the car.
 
On more recent 911s, the underside is painted body color. The Wuerth SKS
Stoneguard is paintable.

Subject: Re: 914 problems! Rod knock and FI

Hi Nick:

Your tapping noise that's audible only inside the engine bay may only be
the sound of mis-adjusted valves.  I recently did a big overhaul of my
motor ('74 2.0) and after 500 miles or so I heard a tapping sound and began
to feel very, very sick. But it was just the valves needing adjustment. :)

$4700 for a 914 that needs (obvious engine) work is not a bad offer, but if
it's worth that in fun to you, then by all means keep it.  I think it's
really pretty silly to keep a car that you simply can't afford to bring up
to snuff / keep running.  

I paid $3000 for my car, and oodles of my time, a rebuilt transmission,
overhauled suspension, fixed-up little things, rebuilt instruments,
repainted (powder-coat) front & rear bumpers & rocker panels & engine grill
& suspension pieces, overhauled brake calipers, new brake lines & rotors,
new wheel baerings, new body seals, overhauled motor, new heater boxes, new
cables, ... (you get the idea) later its only real problem is that it idles
high (1100-1200 rpm) when hot.

Is it worth it?  Well, this car _IS_ immensely fun to drive, and
super-reliable.  But I would have been better off shopping for a
near-perfect car to begin with.

Subject: Re: Problem with mounting 914-4 rear wheels

This is to wrap up my experience with my 914-4 factory Fuchs rear wheel
mounting problem.

I followed a combination of your (collective) advice on methods for
mounting the 914-4's rear wheels. I do have the correct wheel bolts.

Basically, I gradually tightened the four bolts in four stages -
hand-tight, 40Nm, 80Nm, 130Nm, all the while rotating the wheel(s).  I
checked for eccentricity and lateral run-out before and after, and it
didn't make much difference.  My rear wheels show about .75mm eccentricity
and about 0.25mm lateral run-out once mounted and torqued down.

This evening's road test showed a different story - whereas before I felt a
considerable rear-wheel wobble (through the shifter), especially when
accelerating at highway+ speeds, now things are _much_ better.  I can only
attribute the difference to the torque value - I used to tighten the wheel
to 80-90Nm, as that's what my other cars require. Live and Learn (and trust
the Spec Book) certainly applies here. :) I presume these wheels can take
this wheel-bolt torque because they're forged.

Anyway, thanks for all your quick replies. To a man, there was no
disinformation, and I appreciate that.

It's SPRING !  Finally the P'philes has gotten off its total tedium
of people who drive all year and the 356 crowd is showing up.

My view on a 61 356 coupe is ... Rusted it is worth $ 5k or less ..
but remember it has a lot of good parts.  Drivable, but looking like
a road warrior it is worth a little more.  Clean and no rust and
running very well I'd peg value to $ 12k.  Really nice looking,
chrome et al would be worth more.  Really concours is well over
$ 20k.

This is based upon the view that each step of restoration is BIG $$$$.
When you buy the result you can spend less than the previous owner
did.  The market is based not on what the previous owner spent, but
on what we are willing to pay.

Mostly it depends on what you want.  Clearly there is a premium for
sunroof, super, SC, etc.  If you really want a 356, get one !!!

We run under the 13/13 rule as does PCA and Vintage and we usually remind

Ummmm. No, that's not it.

The weight *IS* significant. There are a few pointed things I could say
about front/rear balance on the early cars, and about polar moment of inertia
and all that. Enough that the factory spent a significant amount of time
dicking with the weight distribution for those cars.

And I notice the weight difference enough (as do most racers) that when
I take the car for setting ride height, corner weighting, *AND* alignment,
it goes in with a Stan-sized pile of plate weights to put in the driver's
seat. That way, when I'm done, the car is set up right for how I have
to use it. If you set the car up for no driver, then it's off enough to
make a significant difference when you *DO* have a driver. For some cars,
(the garage queens) that's not a problem I guess. None of those around here, 
though..

I said earlier, "Whatever strokes you best.  Using gasoline from a specific
major refiner was important several years ago if you wanted to keep your
injectors and valves clean, but today all the major brands have comparable
additives (albeit with some differences) so it's much less important to be
picky.  That's good news for the consumer, since what you get at the corner
convenient mart is just as good as what you get at the corner Texaco.

And Scott replies in part, "Well this is where we will disagree.  All
additive packages are *not* equal."

I also said earlier, "Those marketers and ad agencies have got you for sure.
 Run, run, run."

Help, Mom!  Scott the marketing type is after me.  I'm running!

Seriously, Scott, Techron is, indeed, a fine additive package and one that I
would use in any of my cars.  It undoubtedly does what it is intended to do.
 Whether or not I *NEED* to go beyond the corner service station to find it
or a suitable substitute, however, is a different matter.  I doubt it.  If my
sometimes-failing memory serves me correctly in this instance, it was *NOT*
the first additive recommended by all these folks you mention.  Texaco's
System 3 was the first to get the BMW folks' stamp of approval (and BMW
pioneered this effort to test additives in an objective fashion).  That very
public endorsement encouraged all the other big boys to come up with their
own additive to meet BMW's standard, and soon the playing field was level and
more endorsements followed.  And, it remains pretty much so today.

Fortunately for all of us, this isn't a black-or-white issue.  You won't
trash your valves if you find yourself beyond the reach of Chevron's pumps
for a couple of weeks, so don't worry about it.  Life's too short.

I love a good debate, but I hope this one's run its course!

difference, you can retrofit some, but not all of this performance into the
944. Plus you will kill resale value. 
 
Counterpoint: Insurance companies love to hear Porsche and turbo used in
the same sentence. 944 turbos are dogs unless you are on the boost. Parts
and maintenance are pricier and more intensive. 
 
Alternative: 944S (16 valve) is a price and performance midpoint offering a
somewhat wider power band..

I will agree that in a racing situation, autox, driver's ed, anything 
where seconds and tenths of a second will count, that those pounds are 
important, those grams are important (even your wheels are balanced! but 
that's a different topic) However, in city or highway driving, where you 
most likely won't be doing high speed cornering and such, I haven't 
noticed a whole lot of difference... the car doesn't pull to one side or 
another... however, when I go to the driver's ed events this year, I will 
either put the other battery back in, or put something in its place of 
equal weight. At speeds above 80 or so, your weight distribution will 
make a noticeable difference, but at 40 or 50, most people wouldn't 
notice it.

Oh, the other thing is, on the OPTIMA batteries... they will tell you 
that you'll only need one even in winter... this is true for the CCA's, 
but you do want some weight over the front tires if you take your Porsche 
out on the ice, this would be a dangerous situation if you weren't well 
balanced.

Alright, now, since this has started up the 'battery weight' subject and 
will continue (under "some popular subject"), I have a different wonder 
about it. How does it effect the charging system to only have to charge 
one battery vs. two?

Last thing... Has anyone seen the BMW ad, "Oh No." with the car perfectly 
balanced on a point and a feather about to fall on the hood?

Hello All;

After 33 days and about $2500 I finally have my 89 951 back from the body shop.  
I put on the new 17" 5 spoke wheels and drove her home yesterday.  Of course it 
is raining in Maryland today, but who cares.  World order has finally been 
restored to normal.

The only negative aspect of the whole affair is that the insurance company has 
kept the damaged rear wheels which they paid to replace.  Does anyone have an 
idea what a resonable salvage value would be for these wheels?  They have 
already been repaired and polished to the tune of $250 each.  They now have a 
bright polished silver finished that almost looks like chrome.  I called Robert 
Wood and THEY thought $250 for repair and polishing was high.  Wood estimated 
about $400 value for a repaired and polished wheel.  These are the 9x16 forged 
seven spoke wheels found on the Turbos.  Anybody have any experience with 
repairing these type of wheels?  Any comments would be appreciated.

I worked for Amoco Research for 7 years and agree with
Scott Jessen on the major points - gasoline is a commodity
and is freely traded up to the point of distribution where
the additive packages are blended in. *occasionally* trading
will happen after blending to help another company out of a
jam (at the right price) :-)

Also Scott is right about all additive packages not being equal.
Chevron was certainly the high standard for everyone, not because
of the quality of additives (I think they're all approx. the same)
but because they used *much* more than everybody else. Our auto
engineers used to piss and moan that our gas could produce just
as clean an engine as Chevron if the sales and marketing guys would
commit to using the same quantity of polymer additive. I used to 
get it free and add a couple of ounces to my tank with each fill-up
as an "unofficial test" and had no build-up on my valves in 75,000 miles.

The main thing is to use high-quality branded gas from a high-volume
station. It will save you the extra cost in reduced maintenance - honest!

For the paint experts,

I have a 77 911 that has what appears to be guards red paint (the previous
owner had it repainted).  I had some minor repair to the passenger door,
which then required repainting.  The auto paint store sold me the replacement
color for guards red (the said that it was the same) called indian red.  I
was curious to know if this was the correct mix for guards red:

DuPont Lucite Acrylic Lacquer                  Mix Size: 1 pint
402L White(HS)        5.0
429L Red             63.0

465L Binder         163.0
485L Balancer       150.5

The door came out with to much orange and doesn't match the rest of the car.
Now either the previous color was not guards red (could be) or the new color
is not the correct mix.  The thing that caused this mess was the new (to me)
mirror that I put on. It happened to come from an original guards red 911, and
it matches the rest of the car.  I would like to (read that as need to) repaint
the door, but I don't want to continue to do this with a hit or miss pattern
(get a new mix, try it, look at it, does it match, no, repeat cycle).

Scott, are you proposing to save about $.50 on a tank of gas ($25 a year) by 
guesstimating how many gallons you need and then playing mixtologist raising 
octane by 1 point over midgrade if you're lucky enough to guess correct or 
not fill your tank completely?

Subject: Re: Optima batteries

Greetings:

My experience with Optima batteries has been varied.  On one hand they are
very powerful (800 cold cranking amps).  Because they are sealed and contain
no liquid they don't tend to emit carpet and metal eating acids.  They have a
wonderful warranty, (6 years, first 2 years total replacement, next 4 pro
rated) and as said before, they can be mounted in any position.

The downside is, to mount and *secure* one in a late (74 on) 911 you need a
special mounting tray, available, I believe from Automotion or one of the
other mailorder outfits.  You also need a longer ground cable.  They are "one
size fits all" and installation at times requires creativity.  They don't
like to deep cycle, and they don't care for long periods of inactivity.  They
are also not light.  (42 lbs)

I have used them as replacements in 69 thru 73 cars.  (Single Optima
replacing dual originals)  by mounting it on it's side in the drivers side
battery well and modifying the mounting bracket.  from a functional
standpoint they work fine.  They won't go in the passenger side well because
they stick out about 8 inches and interfere with the spare tire.  If weight
and particularly weight distribution is a factor, this is *not* the way to
go.  If the car sits for long periods of time it's *not* the way to go unless
you keep it charged by some means other than driving.  For a daily driver it
works great.  It's comparable in cranking power to the optional 88AH
batteries used in some 911s and it *is*  lighter than they are.  It also
works well in 914s and installs with minor modification to the hold down
clamp.

To match any paint RIGHT is a time consuming job. You can't match paint 
out of the can. You need to mix some then test next to the car let dry 
and compare then test again until it matches.

This is where your friendly body shop comes in handy as they have all 
the colors and to "play" with. It took my friend over 10 hours to match 
the paint on my hood. Luckly I didn't have to pay the hourly rate for 
this. But it cost over 400 anyway to have the hood  stripped and 
painted. The good side to this is that the paint matches perfectly.

BTW hood is guards red with six year old "fade"

Stan points out that the factory spent lots of time dicking with the balance
and polar moment of the early 911s. The whole story of iron weights in the
bumpers (NOT lead weights!!!) is covered in the forthcoming 911 book by
Tobias Aichele of the Porsche press department, "Porsche 911: Forever Young."
 
Yes, you can feel the difference weight (and weight distribution) make.
Every car I have ever tested on a skidpad, bar none, goes faster
counterclockwise, because the driver's weight tends to offset the weight
transfer to the outside (right side) wheels. It's consistent and measurable,
typically 0.02 to 0.04 g difference.

Hi Gang:

We need your help. My friends looking at a 79 930.  The car has 45,000 miles on
it.  Its been lowered with a few goodies, otherwise the car has been taken care
of well.  The current asking price is $19,000 which seemed a bit low??  My
advise was to take it to a shop and have the engine checked before he went any
further.  It has a rough cold start.

He took it to the shop and had a compression checked.  Heres what they found:
All cylinders are producing 100psi with the exception of #3... 70psi.  When the
engine warms up #3 seems to have a better read, back up around 100psi.

1. Does this sound like rings or valves?
 
2. Whats the life expectancy of the bottom end on that engine?
 
3. Whats the average cost for a top end rebuild?
 
4. Is the car worth $19,000 with that in mind, or how about offering $17,000 and
taking it straight to the local fix-it meister?

Thanks in advance!

    Hi there,

I finally rememebered what I was going to ask yeasterday before I got
the latest Excellence (unfortunately, a friend of mine has stolen it
already, but that's ood because I have too much work to do)  but
anyway...
    I need a battery for my 914.  I have purchased an original battery
tray to replace the kludge that's in there now, and the battery I
borrowed form my dad is on its last legs (as evidenced by the fact that
the motor turns over about twice as fast when the car is jump-started -
but it always starts, no matter what!)  Here's my question - is there a
standard battery size that will fit the stock tray (doesn't have to be
as powerful as stock - as long as the car starts, I don't care, no
stereo/AC/etc...) or do I have to get a repro battery?  It has become
painfully obvious that the battery sitting in the (rusty and drooping)
aftermarket tray that's in there now will just not fit on the stock one.
 I tried looking it up in the cross-reference books in various auto
parts places, but to no avail (apparently, people aren't supposed to
drive 20-yr. old foreign cars, let alone 25!)
    Any help is greatly appreciated.

later,

    I think it's becoming clear that there may have been a redesign at
some point...  I immediately understood what the original poster was
referring to as neither the front nor rear of my car ('71) is hubcentric
 - and there is nothing protruding through the rear rotor on my car at
all.  And yes, I am running factory Pedrinni alloys, so I don't have a
case of mismatched parts.  This is one of those few times when I wish
Porsche had just been conventional and gone with wheel studs, as it's a
cast-iron bitch to balance the tire on your foot, hold it with your
hand, start the frst bolt....

For the folks who asked about the $40 paint gun, it's
distributed by Air Force Power Tools, and it's their 
model Mark I Heavy Duty.  The box also says Silver Touch Spray 
Gun and includes a Model # AFB7S.  I think the main thing is Mark I 
Heavy Duty.

Air Force Power Tools distributes a variety of air tools, and at least 
here in western Washington, they can be found at all the  houseware 
chains that sell air compressors, like, Ernst, Eagle Hardware, maybe 
Costco, and so on.

It was recommended to me by a friend who has been restoring cars 
for many years, and whose restorations, like his 1930's Franklins, are 
in the 90-100 point concours class.  In his opinion it's every bit as 
good as a DeVilbis or a Binks.  It may not be as rugged as you would 
want in a shop that paints cars 12 hours a day (although it actually 
might be), but if you do one or two cars a year, it'll last forever.

I've done four cars with the one I have.  Couldn't be happier.

  OFFICE MEMO         Gumout Fuel Additive Question         Date:  3/30/95

There's been a recent thread concerning types of gasoline and their
additives.  I'd like to ask a question on a slightly different aspect of
fuel additives.  First, the background...

My dad was a master mechanic and he absolutely drilled into my thick
head that I should add 1 can of Gumout to the gas at every other 
fillup.  He also strongly recommended adding about 4 oz. of Marvel
Mystery Oil to the gas at the same time as the Gumout.  He came up
with these rules of thumb back in the 50's or 60's -- way before 
additives were added to gasoline as a matter of course.  He also had
no experience with Porsche engines (or aluminum engines or fuel
injection for that matter).

Now for my question:  is it still a good idea to add either Gumout or
Mystery Oil to the gas?  Do the current additives serve the same purpose
as the Gumout?  Is putting Mystery Oil in the tank somewhat similar to
pouring dollar bills in the tank?  Is there any harm done to an engine 
if I continue to do this?

Any and all Porschephiles wisdom will be appreciated!

Bob's right.  The 3M Super Spray Adhesive works fine.
Also, yuou can use 3M Trim Adhesive (I believe this
is the stuff people call bull's snot.) or 3M Vinyl
Top adhesive.  This last is great stuff.  It works
for carpets, vinyl tops, trim, and sound pads.

  You might ask your art instructor if automobiles are

  Modern Art in NYC have a Ferrari exhibit  about
  a year and a half ago (they had an F40, an early 50's
  barchetta and an Alain Prost F1. They also had an F40
  engine and an F1 stripped and chopped to show car
  components). It beat the hell out of the exhibit one guy
  had of how he made a film by putting a camera in the

Greetings,

I have a 356 hood that came with my rusty-hooded 1960 356B (T-5) coupe, but
it doesn't fit.  If I remember correctly, it is slightly too narrow
and slightly too long.  It has the rounded front, so it is not a T-6 hood.
Maybe an A?  Anyone know how to tell what I have?
Any ideas on what it's worth?  It is new in grey primercoat.

Sean, many museums and art galleries have had cars or pictures of cars on 
display, including the Museum of Modern Art (I think that's the correct 
name) in NYC.  Also BMW has commissioned a number of well known artists 
to paint their designs on their products, dating back to the 3.0CSL.

There are several galleries around the country which specialize in 
automotive art.  I realize it's a matter of taste, but your teacher 
probably just doesn't like cars.

Subject: 912 Tuning/smog check


I'm restoring a '69 912 and recently got it running, but now am facing the 
"smog test challenge."  I took it in and it failed on the hydrocarbons -- it 
was something like 2000 vs 700.

The engine was rebuilt by the previous owner and compression checks out 
okay.  However, it is not stock.  It has webers, an electric fuel pump and a 
mechanical advance distributor.  I know that all these things are not 
"California legal."  My question is, are they the reason it's not passing or 
are there some other more general tuning things I should check first? 
 (Valves and carbs were recently adjusted, but the synchronization on the 
carbs may be off.)  My understanding from past postings is that the Webers 
don't necessarily pollute too much, they just aren't certified as 
replacement parts.  I'd hate to start replacing all this stuff and then find 
out it's related to something else.

Also, does anyone know of a good place in the LA area to have this all 
checked out?  Most mechanics I talk to that seem to know anything about 
P-cars don't do smog checks and I'm reluctant to let the smog check guys 
start messing around at $45 per hour.

One more thing on this thread. You don't need to balance the tire on 
your foot. Use the "lug nut wrench handle". Put the handle through one 
of the bolt holes and insert it in the hub. It fits perfectly. The 
handle will now hold the tire in place while you start the bolts.

This is not a problem on 73 and later fronts as there is lip to set the 
wheel on as a part of the hub.

No matter what the 4 "bolt" wheels are a pain to put on.

Similar to the 911SC. *BIG* bearings, big oil pump, etc. Problem is

Personally, I prefer the later 930s, but if the car is otherwise *PERFECT*,
the idea of spending $17k plus whatever the engine is going to cost doesn't

Yer right Andrew. Now I remember why I had to sit on the ground positioning

for the torque business, I used a 356 lug wrench and stopped tightening when
I heard a "squeek." I think "squeeks" are calibrated around 90

Hi, Gregg.
 
You will almost never get an exact match just by following the formula in a
paint book. And your paint supplier should know that. He needs to match the
paint to the car. Take the car to him and have him mix up the paint so that
it matches AS SPRAYED. They have little sample cards with checkerboards and
a hole on them. They spray color on these until the checkerboard is covered
(a check of adequate paint thickness), let it dry, hold against the car and
look at the color difference through the hole. Tint the can of paint, try
again. Etc. It costs extra.

You can ask your snob of a teacher that if cars aren't art, why are they
wasting valuable space in, I think, the NY Museum of Modern Art (Cisitalia
coupe is on permanent display)? This is space that could be used for more
meaningful dreck like another Mapledwarf exhibit. Or something (anything)
using an American flag in an unconventional and probably silly manner, so
that all those stuffy liberals can upset all those stuffy conservatives and
don't you DARE touch the National Endowment for the Arts, you Philistine, etc.
 
Just yesterday I browsed through an expensive coffee table book at Borders
which chronicles some Japanese artist who used early postwar Mercedes 220 S
cabrios as his canvas. First the cars were immaculately restored, then he
painted tropical flowers and such on them. Sort of like the Bhagwan's Rolls
collection but more tasteful/more craftsmanship.
 
Art Center College of Design in Pasadena is the world's premier center for
industrial design, including automotive styling.
 
If welding some twisted steel beams together is considered art, why should
welding some precisely formed sheet metal together be any different?
 
I had to deal with so-called "teachers" like this too. It doesn't do any
good to argue with them, they hold the ultimate weapon in terms of grades.
In unfortunate cases like this, school becomes a learning experience in which
you learn to conform, not to think, or create, or be different. After a
while you learn that you get positive reinforcement for being a yes-man,
repeating (possibly rewording) the pap you have been fed all semester on the
final exam. When these little tin gods recognize their own ideas accepted
and repeated by the student, they graciously give out A grades and feel that
yes, they are making the world a better place, and in their own image.
 
The worst such case I ever had to deal with was one Joe Carroll at Lane Tech
in Chicago, English lit, 1971-1972. If it wasn't James Joyce or at least
Irish, it wasn't literature. He had us do book reviews. He said "Review
three examples of English literature." So I did the Mutiny on the Bounty
trilogy. He was pissed. He had us read stuff like "The Loneliness of the
Long Distance Runner" and "Mary Queen of Scots." Gack, to quote Bill the
Cat. He called us all Philistines. We called him something else, but not
so's he'd hear (see grades discussion above). He didn't like our mangling of
the English language, so he cut out 6-inch letters spelling out the words
STANDARD ENGLISH and propped them up over the blackboard. One day somebody
broke into the room, made the D a B, and rearranged them to spell BASTARD N
SHINGLE. (Sounds like a pub to me.) It took him about half an hour to figure
out why everybody was grinning and looking over his head. He was pissed.
 
Book you may want to get: Art and the Automobile, by D.B. Tubbs, Grossett
and Dunlap, 1978. There are other, better books on the subject but I don't
have any of them. I think the better ones are French. Try library card catalog
under titles, "L'art et l'automobile." For some reason that sticks in my
mind.
 
(Later) I see Cherie Woodward responded also. BTW, so your little dictator
can't get you for being misinformed, Raymond Loewy is the correct spelling.

Dear Nate,

I'd recommend the Optima battery, which eliminates the problem of acid
forever.  It also has a good warranty (2 years' replacement, 7 years
pro-rate).  I put one in my 911 after restoring a ruined trunk.  It
also holds a charge very well, which is important if your car is
seldom used.

Only problem is availability.  There used to be an ad in the auto mags
with an 818-area-code (north L.A.) number, but I haven't seen it
lately.  The outfit I ordered it from, Auto-Mechanika in Colorado,
used to advertise in PANO, but hasn't lately.  This all makes me
wonder, though I think the product is still in existence.

Another caveat:  the posts are on top, exposed, and not too far apart.
I was tightening a nut on the negative, the other end of the wrench

After 8 months, I am emerging from "lurker" status with a request for help from

who have helped me educate myself re: p-cars. The insight, warmth, humor, and 
technical knowledge available here are truly astounding! And I am hopeful to 
join the ranks of P-car owners, for the first time.

Herein lies my request. Since last fall I've been looking hard for a 356 B 
coupe or early 912 that would fit my desires and my budget. I might have found 
one. Here's the scoop:

1967 Porsche 912 located in Menlo Park, near Palo Alto CA.
Asking price $6500; Approx 140K miles. Rebuilt engine - big bore kit
by Ellsworth Bros. 3rd owner; car is a daily driver. Current owner has had car 
5 years, had engine rebuilt, put approx 40K on it. Aga blue; resprayed prior to
current owner. Battery pan, torsion bar mountings replaced. no pan rust.DM 
motors in Channing have done all maintanence. Oil, valve adjustment every 3K; 
full tune (carbs synched, plugs, points, etc ) every 6K. No oil leaks, fumes,
interior excellent; exterior, the same. Not show quality, but presentable.

This is all info I've gotten over the'net form the present owner. I live in 
Granville, Ohio and haven't seen the car. And here comes the request.
Is there someone in the area who would be willing to look over the car for me?  
My intent would be to fly to SF and drive it back to Ohio where it would be wel
 l cared for. (yep, got the spouse to agree to all of this..........) I would
be happy to arrange consideration for the review.

Please feel free to contact me via private E-Mail. Or via the list. I'll kjeep
all posted re: how this proceeds. And if car looks good and I cannot arrange a
purchase, perhaps someone else from the list may benefit.

OK, so call me Anal Retentive, but I don't like paying more and getting
less...  I'm not sugesting you put Midgrade in your P-Car first off, but for
my truck (26 Gal) or my Lumina (16gal) it's just fine.  Both the truck and
lumina ping on the regular (not much, but it bugs me) so I prefer more
octane.  There is nothing you can screw up by mixing regular and supreme, so
the mix ratio is whatever you want (i.e.: you aren't playing  a mad
"mixtologist").  If you want to get the octane that the manufacturer goes
for, mix roughly 1/3 premium and 2/3 regular (.66 * 87 + .34 * 93 = 89
octane).  Let me give you an example from my corner station: Regular $1.03,
Midgrade $1.20, Supreme $1.25; .66 * $1.03 + .34 * $1.25 = $1.10, or a dime
less per gallon that they charge for the same 89 octane. If you can't spare
the time or hassle to push the credit card in one more time and switch
nozzles, don't do it.  I like to save a penny here and there so I can spend
it on the race car (actually I'll spend it whether or not I've saved it
:-)).  Since I tow the race car a hell of a lot and my round trip to work is
over 60 miles, my savings does add up, I figure around $200 per year between
the two non-P cars we run....

Anyway, just thought it was some useful info, I've found that lot's of folks
don't realize that the midgrade is nothing special -- just a higher profit
maker...

The debate in the performance and conceptual art circles is this: if it
causes an "art event" to happen for the viewer, then it's art. Period.

Even knowing that arguement ought to make some kind of difference with
the bonehead art teacher. Then again, if he's a strict represntationalist

Hi Sean,  Call MOMA.  The Museum of Modern Art in N.Y. has elevated many
common objects to the level of "Art" by bestowing their design awards upon
them.  It couldn't hurt to have the credentials of a prestigious Museum
behind your arguement.  Porsche has a long history of designing, (even before
they built cars for themselves) that continues today.  A  design award for a
product probably wouldn't be good enough for your professor anyway.  He
probably dosen't think architecture is Art either (I can hear museums and
cathedrals all over the world crying.)   Just because the sculpture is
functional it can't really be a work of art?  Actually I think your idea of
reviewing a non-tradition object as art is refreshing and would be an
excellent exercise for all your classmates.  Recognized works of art have
been reviewed to death.  Why not subject everday objects to aesthetic critic?
  Too bad about your professor; I think he's been at it too long.  He's

Subject: RE: 944 coolant leak at clutch housing?


Standard feature.  You have a leaking heater valve, located at the
back of the engine on those silly eight-valve 944's.  It's the thing
which gates how much hot water to run through the cabin's heater
core.

When it fails, it leaks down onto the clutch via a cut-out in the top of
the bell housing, which is there so you can see the TDC mark.  If
it leaks too long, you can ruin the clutch.

Replace the valve ASAP and you'll be all set.

My girlfriend has a video she recorded call "Art Cars", which is about
all manner of cars that have been "arted" - there's one that has been
made to look like a big copper whale, one that has grass growing on it
(the driver wears a jacket & boots with grass growing on them, too),

Buy the car!  Grind whatever you can off the price but 19K is a good price if

100# warm is good.  There isn't anything else on the road that will give you

a 76 and 79.  CHP hated them.  Got lotsa cheap shot (65in a 55) type tickets.  
Also, if your friend has not had any track time tell him to get some before he

Hi Gang:

We need your help. My friends looking at a 79 930.  The car has 45,000 miles on
it.  Its been lowered with a few goodies, otherwise the car has been taken care
of well.  The current asking price is $19,000 which seemed a bit low??  My
advise was to take it to a shop and have the engine checked before he went any
further.  It has a rough cold start.

He took it to the shop and had a compression checked.  Heres what they found:
All cylinders are producing 100psi with the exception of #3... 70psi.  When the
engine warms up #3 seems to have a better read, back up around 100psi.

1. Does this sound like rings or valves?
 
2. Whats the life expectancy of the bottom end on that engine?
 
3. Whats the average cost for a top end rebuild?
 
4. Is the car worth $19,000 with that in mind, or how about offering $17,000 and
taking it straight to the local fix-it meister?

Thanks in advance!

Eric Shea

You're right here, whether or not *you* *need* to go looking for a better
product is relevant to you.  However, I was trying to point out that, just
like there are subtle differences in brands of oil (recall the lengthly
debates on "what type of oil is best"), there are differences in gasoline
additives.  Whether or not you want to believe that is not my concern, I
just thought others on the list with FI cars might be interested.

Well, to be honest, I don't know when BMW endorsed Texaco System 3.  I do
know that the US majors have exclusivelly used Chevron for years.  And I do
know that Porsche specifically recommends Techron for their cars, and after
all, this is a Porsche list, is it not?   I did read an interesting article
in the Chronicle about  why Texaco pulled it's last ad campaign on System 3;
let's just leave it that the government made the suggestion...

I'm happy with that.  as long as we can agree on three things: Oils aren't
all the same, gasoline additives aren't all the same, and some folks on this
list seem to be interested in that.

I'll shut up now.  Oh and if you're not going to eat all of those yellow

A good way to try to get a match, rather than just

My car has started making a faint "moaning" sound from the
vicinity of the fuel filler neck. It also cuts out on me occasionally.
I wonder if a vacuum being developed in the fuel tank could
produce a supply problem similar to vapor lock?

At any rate, I am looking at page 20-8 of the service manual that
is labeled "Active Carbon Tank for Pollutant-Free Fuel Tank
Venting (Layout)". I am wondering if it is likely that the carbon tank
itself has become clogged or is it more likely that the valve between
the expansion tank and the carbon tank (labeled: 4 - Safety valve)
has become non-functional.

Kevin, George, anybody, suggestions please!

BTW, Kevin, re motor mounts: tilting the motor to one side and
grinding the stud are excellent optimizations. I wish I had
thought of that before doing my motor mounts. Like the man

Bob, 

  I don't know if it's Murphy's law looming around me or sheer bad
luck. One night during last winter, I had a frozen door lock on
my 944. I sprayed some WD-40 in the key hole and was able to unfreeze
the lock. However, the oil I sprayed ran down the door panel and the next 
morning I had a big white spot around the handle. Later that white
area (what turned out to be the clear-coat finish ) started peeling.

Now I have a ugly area :-( around the door handle, which is without the
clear-coat. Any advice for fixing this, most shops tell me that it is
non-fixable and that they have to clear-coat the whole door. Some went 
as far as saying that the whole side has to be repainted with clear-coat,
since the original clear-coat will appear dull along-side the new coat.

So much for open-mindedness in the art world!
Screw your instructor!  Many people make their

cars to be "art."  The BMW M1 and M6 were displayed

Perhaps you should make him wash and wax a Porsche

Subject: Re: 2 part paints

Afsar-

I'm afraid I don't know exactly what to do to eliminate
the white area.  But I can tell you what I'd try.

I'd first try to rub it out with a bit of rubbing compound
and then some polishing compound.  I doubt that the clear
caot has come off, it's ususally a catalyzed paint that
ought to be impervious to oil and stuff like WD-40.  Sounds
like there's beed a little penetration which has clouded
the coat.  Maybe you can rub the clouded (hopefully) top
layer off.  You can't lose anything if you try.

The old shellac furniture finishes used to cloud like that
if you spilled alcohol on them.  Rubbing repaired the surface.

For a cheap, not very durable, but quick repair to make it
at least look nice, have you thought about spraying on a
bit of clear lacquer, like Krylon?  If the paint guys are
right in saying you just have to spray some clearcoat on it
and the white cloud will disappear (sounds odd to me, though)
than this ought to work.

Good luck!

I don't think so.  I worked at the Amoco refinery in Texas City and I am
positive that the blending stock for Amoco Ultimate was rerun to develop a
clear, premium gasoline.  They used it as a market differentiator in a world
of all-the-same gasolines.  To the consumer it may sound like a marketing
gimmick, but it is not.

I also don't remember hearing about blending in dyes to differentiate grades
of gasoline.  In this day and age of clear everything (Pepsi, dish soap,
gravy (SNL :-)) don't you think other refiners would stop putting these dyes
in their gasolines so they too could market a clear gasoline?  Gasolines are
not normally created clear.

I hate to get into a spat about this.  Just trying to stand my ground.  If we
go much further with this I may pull a brain muscle remembering my days at
Amoco.

Thanks to all who responded to my question re tires. I love this list!!!

I just bought a 914 that was just painted and has no polish or wax on it.
What should I put on it? I don't know what kind of paint or clearcoat was
used, but I can find out from the previous owner. I've got One Grand polish
and wax (carnauba). Should I use that? Is there something you're supposed to
do differently with a fresh paint job? I'd like as glossy a finish as
possible. As you can probably tell, I know next to nothing about paint,
polish and wax, so please don't hesitate to mention anything that may seem
obvious to you. (I'm not even sure what the difference in function is between
polish and wax.) But, hey, I'm learning! Thanks.

For folks in the Northern VA, Washington D.C. area, there is '77 911S Targa
for sale near Newington VA, (about 7 miles south of the D.C. beltway and 
about a mile off 95).

Here are the stats and a few (weak) impressions

Its a 1977 911S Targa w/ papers
Asking prices is $13,900
It was 131,495 miles w/ a claim of no more than 8k miles/year

If interested call Marshall at 703 780 8434

Some observations:
It passed VA inspection 3 months ago
A rust bubble about 3/4 inch across on left front suspension pan
Paint looks good - Saw some bright red in a rock chip along trunk
  line on right side probably been repainted sometime during its life
Wheels and tires look new
A few rock dings around headlights and hood
The rubber seals all look ok
Has am/fm radio & cassette
An Alarm system
There are a few drops of oil under the car - it's been parked there for about
   three weeks - under the rear center of the engine
The top looks to be in good condition
The underside of the engine looks pretty clean as far as the underside of
engines go - I have a '68 911 and its a mess...

I have no idea who this guy is, but thought some one could be interested and
thought I'd do you both a favor. - maybe someone can give it a home

Good luck and happy hunting!

"The Cisitalia Pinin Farina Coupe' received its supreme accolade in 1951
when New York's Museum of Modern Art chose it for its excellence as a work

Why not call them and tell us what you find out?
 
More MoMA stuff:
AQ XIV/2 p. 202, re Lincoln Zephyr (1941ish): "Later the New York Museum of
Modern Art cited the Zephyr as 'the first successfully designed streamlined
car made in America,' a notable affront to Chrysler which was, most agreed,
well earned."

There are other issues that refer to MoMA shows in 1951, 1953 and 1966.
 
The 1947-76 Automotive Literature Index has about 11 column inches of
references to automotive art. 1977-81 has 10 column inches. 20 inches in

If Leroy Neiman is art, then isn't Walter Gotschke art too?
 
Duh, would "Cadillac Ranch" by Ant Farm be considered art? And then there's
"Long Term Parking" somewhere in Paris, I think -- a block of concrete with
embedded cars. And wouldn't the creations of Phil Garner, sometimes seen in
old Road & Tracks, be considered "performance art"? How else would you
describe a 1959 Biscayne body set on its chassis backwards, and seen driving
down the Golden Gate Bridge? This will almost certainly result in an "art
reaction." Possibly a violent one on the part of those who suddenly become
aware of those headlights apparently coming AT them in their lane.

Sounds like quite a neat bunch of videos. My personal fantasy for neat-o car

switch to Citgo most of my loads came from Gulf with a few from Mobil.  I am

that Citgo (in Boston) had been buying their gas from Sunoco of NJ for most

it was Citgo.
     I think that the bad rep that is associated with unbranded fuels comes
from the fact that if an unbranded dealer wants to cheat his customers it is
a lot easier for him to do so, then it would if he was committed to a major
brand, since they tend to keep a certain amount of control over the station,
and how loads are dropped.

Chris,

I put them on my car a little over a year ago.  I think they are great.
Saves alot of time getting the car levelled after replacing the 
torsion bars.  I used mine to adjust my ride height, too.  Works beautifully.
I also had to file the bushings down to get them to fit my car (I think 
someone else mentioned this).  I used some of the stuff called "Formula 5
Prelube" and after about 14 months, have no squeaks at all.  BTW, I 
bought my adj spring plates from Troutman $210.  Lots cheaper than
Automotion, etc.  Another BTW - mine were made be Sway-A-Way, not
Weltmeister.

What is the general wisdom on fixing rock chips in paint on the hood?  Anybody
have any miracle cures for fixing these good as new without major expense?  How
about fixing a slight dent (from a basketball bouncing off the hood)?  It is
not really a dent but from an angle in the sunlight, you can see a slight
depression/crease.  I am thinking of buying a 911 with a couple of chips and
one slight dent in the hood.  The exterior color is red and, of course, I would
want it to be perfect without mortgaging my house to get it that way.  Does
anyone have any experience with the "Dentworks" people fixing this kind of
dent?  Any advice would be appreciated.

Hi all,

I would appreciate if you 944 masters write me their opinions on
the following: 
My 85.5 944 just developed a problem. The steering wheel does 
not always work smoothly. When I steer to the left at about 30
degrees steering becomes harder at one specific point. It is not
very much harder, but noticable. Then I hear a single tick after
which it is smooth again. I do not think it happens on all left
turns though. It is like something becomes stuck at that point
which is quite short. It looks like a problem with power steering,
but what is it? Is it serious or can I continue to live with it?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Subject: 944 (1984) Engine questions

Now that I can get in and out of my "baby", I'd better get at the engine
maintenance.

Over Easter weekend I plan to replace the Cam belt.  I'm just assuming it's
required, as I just got the car several weeks ago, and all I know is it hasn't
been replaced or checked in the last 5 years/12K miles.  I've heard it's wise to
sometimes replace some other parts (guides? rollers?) at the same time.  But I
don't know specifically what all I should replace.  Since I definitely have to
mail-order parts, and will be doing the work out of town at my Dad's shop, I'd
rather spend a few extra bucks to make sure I have ALL the likely parts BEFORE I
start.  Anyone's advice would be much appreciated.  So far list only includes
Cam & B.Shaft belts, P9201 tool, engine mounts.

Also, there seems to be a strange (to me anyhow) noise coming from intake side
of the engine, near the fuel injectors & plugs on the back two cylinders.  It's
kind of a loud clicking, but sounds more like noise a Ford V8 makes when it's
got a loose exhaust header.  Sounds like it's only coming from one cylinder to
me.  But the engine seems to me to run fine and smooth.  I have trouble
isolating it to the exact spot, but it's definitely more towards the back 2
cylinders.  Could it be one injector making more noise than the others?  I used
my cheapie mechanic's stethoscope to listen to the injectors, all over the valve
gear cover, head, balance shaft cover, etc. and nothing seemed strange or noisy.

There does seem to be a slight exhaust leak lower down, around by the driver's
knees or so (judging from bending down beside the car).  But it doesn't seem to
be audible from under the hood.  Maybe it's the same noise, cleverly
disguised???  The sound under the hood seems to be localized near the top and
back of the head though. ???  It couldn't possibly be a leaky head gasket, could
it (without having any other noticeable symptoms)?

Or is this just the way it should sound?  I don't recall noticing it when I
bought it, but maybe it was the Platinum-colored glasses effect...  I suspect
I'll figure it out eventually, but I thought I should ask in case it's a known
sign of an impending-yet-avoidable catastrophe...

Thanks!

Subject: 944 Door Trigger FIXED!

Many thanks to all who replied to my earlier request(s)...
This will be fairly length, as I'll try to address some of the additional
questions
people sent me directly...

Not having been given an easy way out, I finally made some time to work up a 
cure for one of my extremely stubborn door triggers.  I had read reports in a
British 
mag about these things breaking easily, so I was getting pretty worried...

The only real way to do this is to take off the interior door panel (speaker,
pocket 
and handle first) to unhook the lock and latch linkages.  Then you can take off
the 
handle, and see "wassup".  The Haynes manual has a pretty clear disassembly 
procedure, as do the factory manuals.

In my case, there was so much CRAP built up around the lock and linkages, it was
no wonder I could barely open the door with both hands...  At first this seemed
VERY 
odd, coming out of a pretty pristine car (albeit 11 years old).  But it's a
perfect example
of why it's a BAD idea to use grease on parts like this.  Besides lubricating,
the grease
does 2 things over time: (1) dry out and harden, and (2) collect LOTS of dirt!
I'm not 
sure if the whitish grease was a factory thing or not -- the plastic film behind
the door 
panel didn't look like it'd been removed before (??)

None of the parts themselves were damaged or badly worn, although you have to be
fairly 
careful undoing the latch linkage -- there's one plastic snap-on piece that
takes a 
lot of cunning AND force to unhook, and it's in a slightly awkward place.
And as many people thought, the handle (at least) indeed appears to be a VW Audi
part (that's what's stamped on it).  There's no part #, but the little plastic
things that 
go between the handle and the door have part #s on them (if anyone wants, I can 
get them when I do the other one).  The one trouble you may have if trying to
replace
with an Audi part is that I'd bet the latch linkage wouldn't be right, and it's
riveted onto
the handle parts -- so you may have some tricky work there.

To make a long story short, the entire process took about 2 hours, including
cleaning
even the "tumblers" and springs in the lock, and using plenty of graphite on
everything.
The passenger side should take only an hour now, knowing what to do.
The end result is a door I can open with my thumb and my pinkie!  The neighbors
must
be worrying again, what with me standing outside for 10 minutes straight,
opening and 
closing the door and giggling like a mad fool on ether...

To sum up:  get manual+take time+follow steps+clean well+use graphite=VERY
HAPPY!

Happy fiddlings!  Now for the engine mounts, cam&balance shaft belts, power
steering pump...

Subject: Correct mix for paint?

First off, forget the Lucite.  DuPont Chromabase has always given
me a better match.  It's better paint to boot.  They get the mix formula
off fiche (old way) or the DuPont computer.  There are always certain
vagarities due to the skill level of the person using the mix machine
but they are usually not significant.  One possibility you haven't
mentioned is that your "original" paint may have been an incorrect
color, bad mix, or just faded.  (did you try rubbing out the adjacent
panel to see how it comes up?).  Some of the better paint stores have
a paint matching gun that gives them a baseline mix that can be
tinted to the correct color.   I haven't tried it yet but the guys are telling
me it's "pretty accurate, at least 90% of the time".  'Course this is 
coming from people that use calculators to make change.  A REALLY 
GOOD "mixmaster"  (and I worked with one, Lill) can match ANYTHING,
including the color of your shirt.  Check around and find someone that
will work with you when "good" is not good enough.  Have them shoot
a test card.  These are standard paper cards made to mimic an autobody 
finish.  Be aware that mixers usually shoot these with a little compressed
gas cartridge "touch up" rig.  When you shoot the door, your pressure
and feed will be quite different.  This is usually not much of a problem with
solid colors (like yours) but it can be a bitch on metallics.

Excuse the wordiness but I worked in a paint store one summer.
(Did I put enough qualifiers in this message or do I need to add "IMHO"?)

Let me know how it goes.

Ahhh, but its just as easy to Xerox the fiche at your local public 
library on printing fiche viewers. If you're going to copy them anyways, 
why not buy the cheaper source at $15 for fiche, $200+ for paper. The 
fiche viewer was $10.
 
Worst case scenario you copy all the fiche onto paper at 25 cents a page. 
$200/0.25=800 pages. I think there are far fewer than 800 pages in the 
manual. The result is you get fiche + paper at a much lower cost.

Hi, folks. I'm a new member of the list, referred here from the Ducati

the high cost of maintenance for Porsches. I've also heard about 911 SC's
being very reliable, and having "bullet-proof engines". I would very much
appreciate some points of clarification.

1. Are the 1984-1987 Carreras as bullet-proof?
2. How about the rest of the car? Do things fall apart around the engine?
3. What about the 944's -- how do they stack up in terms of reliability?
4. If I buy a 911, it will probably be an early-mid 80's model. What should
I expect to do in terms of normal maintenance/repair on such a 10 year old
car?

Hi Armagan,

I am no Porsche expert, I don't even have a 944 yet, I'm still looking 
for a good used one. However, I did experience a similar problem on my 
non P-car. The steering would be extremely hard to turn to the left 
especially when it was cold. As time went on the stiffness became worse. The 
problem was a bad rack and pinion. It was changed and voila... problem solved.
I later found out that rack and pinion life on my particular make was about
50k miles (failed at 55k). I am sure Porsche life is a lot longer.

This may, or may not, be the source of your problem. Any other opinions??

Hope this helps and Good Luck!

I would suggest that the *history of art criticism* is essentially
the debate of what constitutes "art". Given that your instructor
suggests that a Porsche 911 in not "art", while presumably he
does agree with most art historians that a signed urinal, a pile of
bricks in the Tate gallery and picture of a pipe, labeled "C'est ne
pas un pipe" is art, then to argue that a 911 is not art would be
strongly indicative of a serious recto-cranial inversion of a chronically

You could be heading for a very serious moment, it sounds like you have a 
damaged tooth in the rack, probably caused by a kerb - crunch

That rack could seize solid at any moment, what if your steering fails to 
centre after turning a corner, you could wount the pavement and kill some 
little kid - for the sake of every little kid everywhere get it fixed 
and quick!!!!

Mail george and see if he can help you with a used rack

Subject: Going to the States - need advice

Hi,

Sorry this is not a stricly Porsche related mail, but I think there are
some nice people who might help me a bit here... :-)

Together with my girlfriend I'm going to the States 4 weeks in august.
We plan on arriving in Seattle, drive down along the coast to Vegas and
from there go to L.A.

Please respond directly to me (joker@diku.dk) to avoid this thread from
spreading on Porschephiles...

Now the questions I have are the following:

(1) What kind of car should we rent. I'm (obviously) a car-nut, driving
    two 911's daily. But I wanted to try something really american - like
    a T-Bird or something like that. What I want is a V8 that not too
    conspicuous - we don't want to be attacked because of the car.
    (Sorry, typical european fear having heard manu bad things about USA)

    Would a Corvette cab. be too obvious in the Californian traffic? How
    about in L.A. or Vegas?

(2) How much does plane-tickets from - say L.A. - to Hawaii cost?

(3) Are there any Porsche Club events along the East Coast during august?

(4) How much does a 993 cost to rent in california per day/week?

Thanks in advance...

Please mail me directly - don't want to waste too much bandwidth on this.

Looking at the original design, I surmise that the intent was to vacuum up

time to do the timing belt...)  I surmise that its function was terminated
because it wasn't worth the trouble to do it...

The allen bolt (actually a 12-point triple square) is one of the most
difficult bolts on the engine to remove.  I would suggest that you have a
new one on hand before you attempt this.

My advice: 1) do this before you disturb the belts (that way, if you slip,
you don't bend valves). 2) remove the distributor cap, rotor, and sprocket
cover. 3) Remove the mount for the rotor. 4) Hold the camshaft sprocket in
place with a big six-point offset box end wrench and attempt to loosen the
12 point bolt with the good tool. 4) After stripping out the head of the
bolt, get out a 3/8 inch drill and drill the head out. 5) Once the tension
is taken off the bolt, you can spin it out with your finger.

Vehicles Affected: 944 Series II cars (1985/2 or later or 944s

front lower suspensions. This problem is seen on 944s that have

In the interest of maximizing the safety of all entrants at the 
Zone 1 48 Hours of Watkins Glen, cars that have been lowered 
should be set at stock factory ride height. Ball joints and 
control arms should be checked and replaced if necessary.

If a 944/968 has been lowered below factory specifications, it
causes undue forces to be applied to the ball joint and the
lower suspension member, leaving the balljoint and the lower
suspension area prone to failure. Installation of shorter or

Ride height is to be measured from the fender lip directly

I just ran a "does anybody" request on "Paintless Dent Removal" and got many
responses.  All respondents were favorable and very impressed with the results. 
As long as the paint isn't cracked and the operator is good at his craft
(some referred to it as vodoo), it is a reasonable alternative to the
bodyshop repair.     Costs about $100 +/- per panel. 

There are a number of companies/individuals out there all going by the name
"Dent Whatever" (DentWizard, Dentworks, Dentman, Dentpro...) Trick is to
find a good one local to you.  The Dentworks here in Boston is no longer in
business but others around the country have used a Dentworks and liked their
work.  I found an individual who does work for the local Mercedes & Porsche
dealers.  They use him repeatedly.  

Good Luck.

This is what I am trying to tell you. The clear coat that 
was penetrated and clouded by WD-40 then started to peal off and now
I am left with an area of bare paint i.e. paint without the clear
coat. The edges of the clear coat (where it peeled off ) makes it
look ugly and very noticeable.

I have tried using some Sherwin Williams clear coat but was unable
to hide those lines between the old and the new paint. I didn't use
the rubbing compound but I will give that a try before spraying the
clear coat again.

By the way what grid of sand paper can I use for the initial and the
final finish.

Need some net wisdom:
I am entering my waterpumper in the Brian Redman 500 at Summit Point in
May.This is not a PCA Club Race. One of the requirements of participation is
that no antifreeze can be used. This is for obvious reasons, being that
antifreeze somehow  turns into ball bearings once spilled onto a track
surface.
(For some reason we are not required to drain antifreeze for Club Racing)
Anyway is there any additive that needs to be added to straight water to

Through all this debate, most of us said if MoMA has a Ferrrari exhibit than 
MoMA is saying thier art.

Well, I spoke briefly with my sister last night (Associate Curator at the 
Whitney Museum of Modern Art) and she said Stan and I were right. (It's 
interesting, Stan's always right. I don't know why I disagreed with him in 
the first place)

The problem is, the Ferrari exhibit. According to my sister, MoMA shows art 
and design and the Ferrari exhibit is a _design_ exhibit.

She did say that if Sean intends to represent a Porsche as art then he can. 
It was a short conversation and not being an art expert I may have missed a 
few important points so I CC'ed her and I'm sure if a butchered her comments 
she'll let me know.

Subject: Odds & Ends

I've been a faithful reader of Porschephiles for some time now, and have been
saving up many questions I have concerning my late 1985 944.  I'm hoping all
you knowledgeable 944 owners will be able to help.
1) I just replaced the entire sunroof cable assembly, made necessary since a
cable on one of the arms broke and Porsche does not make individual
replacement parts.  Now when the arms retract into the roof housing, the
motor does not shut off when they are fully in, until you take your hand off
the switch.  The original cable functioned properly.  I have adjusted the
microswitch on the end of the motor assembly, but this has no affect.
2) The fasten seat belt light on the dash randomly pops on when driving, then
goes off again.  No one and nothing is on the passenger seat.
3) The cruise control will hold the speed for a while, then surge faster.  I
have seen and saved the posting about the repair place in Tennessee, but was
wondering if possibly there is a sensor that I should replace first before I
remove the brain controller.
4) The idle sometimes bouces up and down from about 900 rpm to 1200 rpm, and
eventually settles down.  the idle controller valve has been replaced, and
tuneups have had no effect.
5) When upshifting from first to second the gears grind if shifted rapidly,
but no problem on downshifting, and no problem if not shifted rapidly.  The
clutch has been previously replaced .
FYI, the car now has 145,000 miles (I've owned since new) and has had almost
everything replaced at least twice!
Thanks in advance for everyone's assistance.

Subject: Insurance Hassles


Sorry if this is old news, I just joined the list this week.  The reason I 
joined is that I looked at an '88 928 that I was hoping to purchase 
tomorrow.  In any case, I called my insurance company for a rate quote.  I 
should've known something was wrong when the agent who answered the phone 
said to me, "Oh, a Porsche.  I'll have to get a supervisor to call you." 
 When I asked why, she replied "Porsche's arent in my computer because they 
are evaluated on a case by case basis."  I left my name and # and waited for 
a call back.  Finally, I get a call from a supervisor.  First she says, 
"Yeah, we'll insure that car" like she's doing me some kind of favor.  Then 
she quotes me a RIDICULOUS rate.  I asked why it was so high since I'm 28, 
married, 2 other cars on the policy, no tickets, etc... She gives me this 
whole "sports car, goes real fast, blah blah blah" spiel.  So I told her my 
other car was newer, worth more, driven more and also goes pretty fast 
(although that still doesn't mean I speed).  Evenutally, I realized it was 
pointless to argue.  Have the rest of you guys had to put up with this kind 
of stuff?  Is reasonably priced insurance for a Porsche possible?  At this 
point I'm thinking of not buying the car, because I've heard of people 
getting dropped just because they bought a Porsche.

Thanks.

Please post that phone number! I've been using Aero-Kroil, from Kano Labs,
which is the best penetrant I've come across so far, but for one thing
I'm always ready to try something that might be better, and for another
Kano Labs can be a pain in the ass to deal with.

John,
      I had a wiring problem with my 944S a few weeks ago. One of
my headlamps suddenly went out while in use. On investigation
I found that the fuse had blown. The replacement fuse also blew.
An hour spent with an multimeter traced the fault to the three wires
leading to the connector behind the headlamp unit.
All three cables are covered in a sleave and after stripping back the 
sleaving I found that the insulation had been worn from two of them
causing a short, and one of those (the earth) had actually broken. 

I think the problem was caused by the wiring not being adequately 
secured and therefore susceptible to vibration. It's now tie-wrapped
just as securely as the other side which checked OK.

Subject: Non Porsche cruzin' story

One night (in 54, I guess) myself and 2 buddys decided to go out cruzin.
Well, we hit all the drive-in resturants and came up with nothing to do. One
of us knew a girl who took tickets at the local drive in movie theatre--he
was sure she would let us in--so we headed for the drive in. Well we got
there and she wasn't working. We drove right up to the ticket sale booth,
looked at the sales person and backed out again. Wellllll one of us said it
was a shame to go home after driving all the way out and that our plan should
be to BACK INTO THE EXIT, in this fashion we could gain entry to the drive in
and no one would be the wiser because they would see tail lights--the
customary view of people leaving. So we drove around the the exit lane,
turned the car around (nobody thought about back up lights being somewhat
tell tale that something was amiss near their exit) and proceeded to back
into the drivein. Well, we got pretty far into the drivein but we seemed to
be drawing the attention of a bunch of ushers with flashlights. We decided to
turn the car around with one of those racecar like manuvers, where you back
up--change direction,downshift and leave the opposition watching--and we
manuvered right into a parked car. We hit him pretty good--he was minding his
own business and being intimate with his girl friend. He didn't know what hit
him. Naturally, the crash sort of attracted attention in the drivein.
Actually, the movie went off and the house lights came on. The ushers
escorted us to the owner of the drive-in and he decided not to  press charges
against us for entering without paying. The guy we hit wanted no part of
reporting the accident--he was driving without a liscense. My buddy,
Thurston's car incurred considerable damage and the owner of the drivein
muttered something about serves us right and called a tow truck. CAN YOU
IMAGINE THE  EMBARRASEMENT OF BEING TOWED OUT OF A DRIVEIN MOVIE WITH A TOW
TRUCK AND YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING AND EVERYTHING. We didn't try to back into
the drivein again.

I just ran a "does anybody" request on "Paintless Dent Removal" and got many
responses.  All respondents were favorable and very impressed with the results. 
As long as the paint isn't cracked and the operator is good at his craft
(some referred to it as vodoo), it is a reasonable alternative to the
bodyshop repair.     Costs about $100 +/- per panel. 

There are a number of companies/individuals out there all going by the name
"Dent Whatever" (DentWizard, Dentworks, Dentman, Dentpro...) Trick is to
find a good one local to you.  The Dentworks here in Boston is no longer in
business but others around the country have used a Dentworks and liked their
work.  I found an individual who does work for the local Mercedes & Porsche
dealers.  They use him repeatedly.  

Good Luck.

This is what I am trying to tell you. The clear coat that 
was penetrated and clouded by WD-40 then started to peal off and now
I am left with an area of bare paint i.e. paint without the clear
coat. The edges of the clear coat (where it peeled off ) makes it
look ugly and very noticeable.

I have tried using some Sherwin Williams clear coat but was unable
to hide those lines between the old and the new paint. I didn't use
the rubbing compound but I will give that a try before spraying the
clear coat again.

By the way what grid of sand paper can I use for the initial and the
final finish.

I am entering my waterpumper in the Brian Redman 500 at Summit Point in
May.This is not a PCA Club Race. One of the requirements of participation is
that no antifreeze can be used. This is for obvious reasons, being that
antifreeze somehow  turns into ball bearings once spilled onto a track

(For some reason we are not required to drain antifreeze for Club Racing)
Anyway is there any additive that needs to be added to straight water to

Through all this debate, most of us said if MoMA has a Ferrrari exhibit than 
MoMA is saying thier art.

Well, I spoke briefly with my sister last night (Associate Curator at the 
Whitney Museum of Modern Art) and she said Stan and I were right. (It's 
interesting, Stan's always right. I don't know why I disagreed with him in 
the first place)

The problem is, the Ferrari exhibit. According to my sister, MoMA shows art 
and design and the Ferrari exhibit is a _design_ exhibit.

She did say that if Sean intends to represent a Porsche as art then he can. 
It was a short conversation and not being an art expert I may have missed a 
few important points so I CC'ed her and I'm sure if a butchered her comments 
she'll let me know.

Subject: Odds & Ends

I've been a faithful reader of Porschephiles for some time now, and have been
saving up many questions I have concerning my late 1985 944.  I'm hoping all
you knowledgeable 944 owners will be able to help.
1) I just replaced the entire sunroof cable assembly, made necessary since a
cable on one of the arms broke and Porsche does not make individual
replacement parts.  Now when the arms retract into the roof housing, the
motor does not shut off when they are fully in, until you take your hand off
the switch.  The original cable functioned properly.  I have adjusted the
microswitch on the end of the motor assembly, but this has no affect.
2) The fasten seat belt light on the dash randomly pops on when driving, then
goes off again.  No one and nothing is on the passenger seat.
3) The cruiuch harder, but noticable.
> 

Armagan, 

  Does this only happen on low speed. If so, then I had a similar
problem with the same tick noise. It turned out that the outer wheel 
bearing on my 944 were loose to the point where turning the steering
wheel would tilt the front wheels to an angle (sort of like toe-out,
only bigger).

It could be something else on you car but do check out the front wheel
bearing and make sure they are properly tighten.  If there is no play
in both of the front wheels then proceed to steering rack trouble
shooting.

Good Luck!

	Hi Mike and P-nuts:

I would like to recommend that you do not use the adj sp for height adjustment
as I mentioned in my previous email. You should use the teeth on the torsion
bars and get the height almost perfect with the adjusting plate screw in the
middle of its travel. Then use the screws to fine tweak the height and weight
balance the corners.
I am just trying to tell you that these plates are advertised for height
adj. but in fact they are not designed for that reason. 
BTW, mine too are built by Sway-A-way.
Do not forget to have a pro align and balance the four corners! makes the car

Subject: 914 hunting

Hi 'philes.

(First, if you're in a hurry, you might just want to skip to "Now, some
questions:" down below. :)

Recently I decided I needed another car that wasn't such a fan of vandalism
that my nice 944S is (a few weeks ago, I was in a parking lot less than 5
minutes and returned to a car decorated with permenant marker - took a few
hours to polish out.) so that I could breathe a little easier driving to
certain Unfamiliar places.

Since I'm no fan of mid eighties econoboxes, I thought a BMW 2002 would be
pretty neat.  Unfortunately the "nice" ones (pre-smog) were out of my
price range.  I'm looking in the $3Kish area.  I did find a very nice
original '76 2002 with all records since new and very stock, I gave it a try
and was underwhelmed.

So, I was unhappy.  Was I headed to mid-eighties econobox land? No!
I found myself thinking thusly: "What could be better than TWO Porsches!"

I recalled that while looking in the paper there seemed to be a fair
amount of 914's in my required price range.  The idea of a mid-engine
two seater targa has always appealed to me, so I circled the ad "1976 914
2.0 excellent xxx-xxxx" and was off.

First, my driving impressions:  wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeOoooooo!!!!

Fun, nimble, very zippy, wonderfully noisey!  Totally, utterly impractical.
I want one.

My girlfriend thinks I'm insane, but what's wrong with a bit of
insanity to go along with your Porsche(s)?

Now, some questions:

The car in question (76 2.0) seemed...well...  bad.  No records, the seller
knew almost nothing about the car, etc etc.

To me it looked like someone started to restore it, and ran out of money.
New seats, targa top, springs/struts/etc.

The car had also been resprayed a year or so ago (judging by the fade).
It was not a good job.  The trim pieces were left on and masked around,
etc.  There were 2 or 3 small visible rust bubbles in both storage 
compartments.  The battery tray was also rusted with all the paint flaking
off.

A question about rust:  How much is too much?  Reading the 914 FAQ,
the battery tray is a very common rust point.  In my $3K price range,
I expect I may be seeing a bit more of this.  Is there a point
where the rust can be amputated fairly easily?  Obviously if the
battery tray is rusted there is going to be some on on the chassis
there too.  Or should I hold out for an utterly rust free car?

The transmission was also pretty much shot.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd
gear synchro's were non-existant.  How much does a tranny rebuild
run on the 73 or later 914's?  This car also had the Euro gear
shift pattern.  How common was this?

The gas pedal seemed to require far more pressure than seems
correct (as much or more than the clutch).  I assume this isn't
normal?

Am I expecting too much from a car marked "Excellent!" for
$3600?  I'd like a car that's reliable, rust free, and well
maintained and preferably stock.  It doesn't have to be beautiful,
I even wouldn't mind "dogged" and "ugly", as long as it isn't 
rusty.  Doesn't have to be a 2.0 either.  I'd prefer a 73 or later,
but again, not a requirement.

Any other helpful 914 tidbits would be much appreciated.

This was a problem in particular for the 944S.  A service bulletin
recommended removing a long vent line which ran from the can
along the drive side rocker.  Apparently they had a number of
cars whose fuel tanks collapsed in the winter months.

I don't know whether this is your problem.  I would check the vent
and I would also check the fuel return line for damage (kinking).
In fact, just go over all the lines to and from the tank, expansion

Welding is also an option.  Never done it myself, though.

As a rule, you have to be really careful to get full engagement when
turning an allen head or triple square head bolt.  The allens just want
to munge.  The triple squares are quite a bit better, no doubt because
their design puts torque on flat faces in the spline head, where an allen
basically puts most of the torque along the face.

So clean out the bolt head with carb cleaner, a brush, or whatever
before sticking the bit in it.  Esp. important for the CV bolts, which
are invariably crud-laden.

It sounds like this is a problem with the power steering.  Its design
is quite clever, being basically torque sensitive.  I am not sure
what will fix things for you.  I would begin by draining your PS
fluid, replacing the reservoir with a new one, and replenishing
with fresh ATF.

You have to replace the reservoir because it contains a non-
servicable filter at its base (I am told).  You will drain the system
by opening a union bolt at the rack or at the PS pump; you will
need new seal rings when you put it back together.

Of course, start by making sure your PS reservoir is topped off.
If you're dry, it cannot do its work.

Subject: Insurance Hassles


Sorry if this is old news, I just joined the list this week.  The reason I 
joined is that I looked at an '88 928 that I was hoping to purchase 
tomorrow.  In any case, I called my insurance company for a rate quote.  I 
should've known something was wrong when the agent who answered the phone 
said to me, "Oh, a Porsche.  I'll have to get a supervisor to call you." 
 When I asked why, she replied "Porsche's arent in my computer because they 
are evaluated on a case by case basis."  I left my name and # and waited for 
a call back.  Finally, I get a call from a supervisor.  First she says, 
"Yeah, we'll insure that car" like she's doing me some kind of favor.  Then 
she quotes me a RIDICULOUS rate.  I asked why it was so high since I'm 28, 
married, 2 other cars on the policy, no tickets, etc... She gives me this 
whole "sports car, goes real fast, blah blah blah" spiel.  So I told her my 
other car was newer, worth more, driven more and also goes pretty fast 
(although that still doesn't mean I speed).  Evenutally, I realized it was 
pointless to argue.  Have the rest of you guys had to put up with this kind 
of stuff?  Is reasonably priced insurance for a Porsche possible?  At this 
point I'm thinking of not buying the car, because I've heard of people 
getting dropped just because they bought a Porsche.

Thanks.

John,
      I had a wiring problem with my 944S a few weeks ago. One of
my headlamps suddenly went out while in use. On investigation
I found that the fuse had blown. The replacement fuse also blew.
An hour spent with an multimeter traced the fault to the three wires
leading to the connector behind the headlamp unit.
All three cables are covered in a sleave and after stripping back the 
sleaving I found that the insulation had been worn from two of them
causing a short, and one of those (the earth) had actually broken. 

I think the problem was caused by the wiring not being adequately 
secured and therefore susceptible to vibration. It's now tie-wrapped
just as securely as the other side which checked OK.

Subject: Non Porsche cruzin' story

One night (in 54, I guess) myself and 2 buddys decided to go out cruzin.
Well, we hit all the drive-in resturants and came up with nothing to do. One
of us knew a girl who took tickets at the local drive in movie theatre--he
was sure she would let us in--so we headed for the drive in. Well we got
there and she wasn't working. We drove right up to the ticket sale booth,
looked at the sales person and backed out again. Wellllll one of us said it
was a shame to go home after driving all the way out and that our plan should
be to BACK INTO THE EXIT, in this fashion we could gain entry to the drive in
and no one would be the wiser because they would see tail lights--the
customary view of people leaving. So we drove around the the exit lane,
turned the car around (nobody thought about back up lights being somewhat
tell tale that something was amiss near their exit) and proceeded to back
into the drivein. Well, we got pretty far into the drivein but we seemed to
be drawing the attention of a bunch of ushers with flashlights. We decided to
turn the car around with one of those racecar like manuvers, where you back
up--change direction,downshift and leave the opposition watching--and we
manuvered right into a parked car. We hit him pretty good--he was minding his
own business and being intimate with his girl friend. He didn't know what hit
him. Naturally, the crash sort of attracted attention in the drivein.
Actually, the movie went off and the house lights came on. The ushers
escorted us to the owner of the drive-in and he decided not to  press charges
against us for entering without paying. The guy we hit wanted no part of
reporting the accident--he was driving without a liscense. My buddy,
Thurston's car incurred considerable damage and the owner of the drivein
muttered something about serves us right and called a tow truck. CAN YOU
IMAGINE THE  EMBARRASEMENT OF BEING TOWED OUT OF A DRIVEIN MOVIE WITH A TOW
TRUCK AND YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING AND EVERYTHING. We didn't try to back into
the drivein again.

Armagan, 

  Does this only happen on low speed. If so, then I had a similar
problem with the same tick noise. It turned out that the outer wheel 
bearing on my 944 were loose to the point where turning the steering
wheel would tilt the front wheels to an angle (sort of like toe-out,
only bigger).

It could be something else on you car but do check out the front wheel
bearing and make sure they are properly tighten.  If there is no play
in both of the front wheels then proceed to steering rack trouble
shooting.

Good Luck!

I would like to recommend that you do not use the adj sp for height adjustment

balance the corners.
I am just trying to tell you that these plates are advertised for height
adj. but in fact they are not designed for that reason. 
BTW, mine too are built by Sway-A-way.
Do not forget to have a pro align and balance the four corners! makes the car

Subject: 914 hunting

Hi 'philes.

(First, if you're in a hurry, you might just want to skip to "Now, some
questions:" down below. :)

Recently I decided I needed another car that wasn't such a fan of vandalism
that my nice 944S is (a few weeks ago, I was in a parking lot less than 5
minutes and returned to a car decorated with permenant marker - took a few
hours to polish out.) so that I could breathe a little easier driving to
certain Unfamiliar places.

Since I'm no fan of mid eighties econoboxes, I thought a BMW 2002 would be
pretty neat.  Unfortunately the "nice" ones (pre-smog) were out of my
price range.  I'm looking in the $3Kish area.  I did find a very nice
original '76 2002 with all records since new and very stock, I gave it a try
and was underwhelmed.

So, I was unhappy.  Was I headed to mid-eighties econobox land? No!
I found myself thinking thusly: "What could be better than TWO Porsches!"

I recalled that while looking in the paper there seemed to be a fair
amount of 914's in my required price range.  The idea of a mid-engine
two seater targa has always appealed to me, so I circled the ad "1976 914
2.0 excellent xxx-xxxx" and was off.

First, my driving impressions:  wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeOoooooo!!!!

Fun, nimble, very zippy, wonderfully noisey!  Totally, utterly impractical.
I want one.

My girlfriend thinks I'm insane, but what's wrong with a bit of
insanity to go along with your Porsche(s)?

Now, some questions:

The car in question (76 2.0) seemed...well...  bad.  No records, the seller
knew almost nothing about the car, etc etc.

To me it looked like someone started to restore it, and ran out of money.
New seats, targa top, springs/struts/etc.

The car had also been resprayed a year or so ago (judging by the fade).
It was not a good job.  The trim pieces were left on and masked around,
etc.  There were 2 or 3 small visible rust bubbles in both storage 
compartments.  The battery tray was also rusted with all the paint flaking
off.

A question about rust:  How much is too much?  Reading the 914 FAQ,
the battery tray is a very common rust point.  In my $3K price range,
I expect I may be seeing a bit more of this.  Is there a point
where the rust can be amputated fairly easily?  Obviously if the
battery tray is rusted there is going to be some on on the chassis
there too.  Or should I hold out for an utterly rust free car?

The transmission was also pretty much shot.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd
gear synchro's were non-existant.  How much does a tranny rebuild
run on the 73 or later 914's?  This car also had the Euro gear
shift pattern.  How common was this?

The gas pedal seemed to require far more pressure than seems
correct (as much or more than the clutch).  I assume this isn't
normal?

Am I expecting too much from a car marked "Excellent!" for
$3600?  I'd like a car that's reliable, rust free, and well
maintained and preferably stock.  It doesn't have to be beautiful,
I even wouldn't mind "dogged" and "ugly", as long as it isn't 
rusty.  Doesn't have to be a 2.0 either.  I'd prefer a 73 or later,
but again, not a requirement.

Any other helpful 914 tidbits would be much appreciated.

This was a problem in particular for the 944S.  A service bulletin
recommended removing a long vent line which ran from the can
along the drive side rocker.  Apparently they had a number of
cars whose fuel tanks collapsed in the winter months.

I don't know whether this is your problem.  I would check the vent
and I would also check the fuel return line for damage (kinking).
In fact, just go over all the lines to and from the tank, expansion

If you get to this step, you might want to first try the following.  Get a

It sounds like this is a problem with the power steering.  Its design
is quite clever, being basically torque sensitive.  I am not sure
what will fix things for you.  I would begin by draining your PS

You could be heading for a very serious moment, it sounds like you have a 
damaged tooth in the rack, probably caused by a kerb - crunch

That rack could seize solid at any moment, what if your steering fails to 
centre after turning a corner, you could wount the pavement and kill some

and quick!!!!

We plan on arriving in Seattle, drive down along the coast to Vegas and

Now the questions I have are the following:

(1) What kind of car should we rent. I'm (obviously) a car-nut, driving
    two 911's daily. But I wanted to try something really american - like
    a T-Bird or something like that. What I want is a V8 that not too
    conspicuous - we don't want to be attacked because of the car.
    (Sorry, typical european fear having heard manu bad things about USA)

    Would a Corvette cab. be too obvious in the Californian traffic? How
    about in L.A. or Vegas?

(2) How much does plane-tickets from - say L.A. - to Hawaii cost?

(3) Are there any Porsche Club events along the East Coast during august?

(4) How much does a 993 cost to rent in california per day/week?

Thanks in advance...

Looking at the original design, I surmise that the intent was to vacuum up

time to do the timing belt...)  I surmise that its function was terminated
because it wasn't worth the trouble to do it...

The allen bolt (actually a 12-point triple square) is one of the most
difficult bolts on the engine to remove.  I would suggest that you have a
new one on hand before you attempt this.

My advice: 1) do this before you disturb the belts (that way, if you slip,
you don't bend valves). 2) remove the distributor cap, rotor, and sprocket
cover. 3) Remove the mount for the rotor. 4) Hold the camshaft sprocket in
place with a big six-point offset box end wrench and attempt to loosen the
12 point bolt with the good tool. 4) After stripping out the head of the
bolt, get out a 3/8 inch drill and drill the head out. 5) Once the tension
is taken off the bolt, you can spin it out with your finger.

Subject: Re: 944 Ride Height and Safety

Thanks to all of the Porschephiles who responded to the survey 
of 944 Ride Height.

The results are as follows:

Total Number of Responses: 24

From 14 inches to 13 3/4 inches   - 12
From 13 11/16 - 13 1/2 inches     -  5
From 13 7/16 - 13 1/4 inches      -  4
From 13 3/16 - 13 inches          -  2
Less than 13 inches               -  1  (Had been Lowered)

The following announcement is provided as information for those 
who might be considering attending the Zone 1 48 Hours of 
Watkins Glen Driver Education, to be held July 1-2, 1995

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
944/968 Ball Joint Failure

Vehicles Affected: 944 Series II cars (1985/2 or later or 944s 
of the earlier years (1983-1985/1) that have retrofitted cast 
front lower suspensions. This problem is seen on 944s that have 
been lowered and driven aggressively.

In the interest of maximizing the safety of all entrants at the 
Zone 1 48 Hours of Watkins Glen, cars that have been lowered 
should be set at stock factory ride height. Ball joints and 
control arms should be checked and replaced if necessary.

If a 944/968 has been lowered below factory specifications, it
causes undue forces to be applied to the ball joint and the
lower suspension member, leaving the balljoint and the lower
suspension area prone to failure. Installation of shorter or
aftermarket springs with lower profiles also lend themselves to
contributing to the failure of the baljoint and suspension.

No endorsement of any changes or suppliers is made by PCA, Zone 
1 or its respective members or officials.

Technical inspection for the Zone 1 event will include a check 
for conformation to stock ride height as depicted in the 
attached diagram. Vehicles which do not meet the illustrated 
specification of 13 inches or 33.5 centimeters will not be 
permitted to participate in the Zone 1 48 Hours.

Ride height is to be measured from the fender lip directly
above the wheel to the center of the wheel hub.

(Terrible ASCII art follows) The points are the center of the
wheel (marked with X) and the bottom of the fender lip directly
above the wheel center (marked with Y)

I just ran a "does anybody" request on "Paintless Dent Removal" and got many
responses.  All respondents were favorable and very impressed with the results. 
As long as the paint isn't cracked and the operator is good at his craft
(some referred to it as vodoo), it is a reasonable alternative to the
bodyshop repair.     Costs about $100 +/- per panel. 

There are a number of companies/individuals out there all going by the name
"Dent Whatever" (DentWizard, Dentworks, Dentman, Dentpro...) Trick is to
find a good one local to you.  The Dentworks here in Boston is no longer in
business but others around the country have used a Dentworks and liked their
work.  I found an individual who does work for the local Mercedes & Porsche
dealers.  They use him repeatedly.  

Good Luck.

This is what I am trying to tell you. The clear coat that 
was penetrated and clouded by WD-40 then started to peal off and now
I am left with an area of bare paint i.e. paint without the clear
coat. The edges of the clear coat (where it peeled off ) makes it
look ugly and very noticeable.

I have tried using some Sherwin Williams clear coat but was unable
to hide those lines between the old and the new paint. I didn't use
the rubbing compound but I will give that a try before spraying the
clear coat again.

By the way what grid of sand paper can I use for the initial and the
final finish.

Need some net wisdom:
I am entering my waterpumper in the Brian Redman 500 at Summit Point in
May.This is not a PCA Club Race. One of the requirements of participation is
that no antifreeze can be used. This is for obvious reasons, being that
antifreeze somehow  turns into ball bearings once spilled onto a track
surface.
(For some reason we are not required to drain antifreeze for Club Racing)
Anyway is there any additive that needs to be added to straight water to
inhibit corrosion or any other evils that may take place.

Through all this debate, most of us said if MoMA has a Ferrrari exhibit than 
MoMA is saying thier art.

Well, I spoke briefly with my sister last night (Associate Curator at the 
Whitney Museum of Modern Art) and she said Stan and I were right. (It's 
interesting, Stan's always right. I don't know why I disagreed with him in

The problem is, the Ferrari exhibit. According to my sister, MoMA shows art 
and design and the Ferrari exhibit is a _design_ exhibit.

She did say that if Sean intends to represent a Porsche as art then he can. 
It was a short conversation and not being an art expert I may have missed a 
few important points so I CC'ed her and I'm sure if a butchered her comments

Subject: Odds & Ends

I've been a faithful reader of Porschephiles for some time now, and have been
saving up many questions I have concerning my late 1985 944.  I'm hoping all
you knowledgeable 944 owners will be able to help.
1) I just replaced the entire sunroof cable assembly, made necessary since a
cable on one of the arms broke and Porsche does not make individual
replacement parts.  Now when the arms retract into the roof housing, the
motor does not shut off when they are fully in, until you take your hand off
the switch.  The original cable functioned properly.  I have adjusted the
microswitch on the end of the motor assembly, but this has no affect.
2) The fasten seat belt light on the dash randomly pops on when driving, then
goes off again.  No one and nothing is on the passenger seat.
3) The cruise control will hold the speed for a while, then surge faster.  I
have seen and saved the posting about the repair place in Tennessee, but was
wondering if possibly there is a sensor that I should replace first before I
remove the brain controller.
4) The idle sometimes bouces up and down from about 900 rpm to 1200 rpm, and
eventually settles down.  the idle controller valve has been replaced, and
tuneups have had no effect.
5) When upshifting from first to second the gears grind if shifted rapidly,
but no problem on downshifting, and no problem if not shifted rapidly.  The
clutch has been previously replaced .
FYI, the car now has 145,000 miles (I've owned since new) and has had almost
everything replaced at least twice!
Thanks in advance for everyone's assistance.

Subject: Insurance Hassles


Sorry if this is old news, I just joined the list this week.  The reason I 
joined is that I looked at an '88 928 that I was hoping to purchase 
tomorrow.  In any case, I called my insurance company for a rate quote.  I 
should've known something was wrong when the agent who answered the phone 
said to me, "Oh, a Porsche.  I'll have to get a supervisor to call you." 
 When I asked why, she replied "Porsche's arent in my computer because they 
are evaluated on a case by case basis."  I left my name and # and waited for 
a call back.  Finally, I get a call from a supervisor.  First she says, 
"Yeah, we'll insure that car" like she's doing me some kind of favor.  Then 
she quotes me a RIDICULOUS rate.  I asked why it was so high since I'm 28, 
married, 2 other cars on the policy, no tickets, etc... She gives me this 
whole "sports car, goes real fast, blah blah blah" spiel.  So I told her my 
other car was newer, worth more, driven more and also goes pretty fast 
(although that still doesn't mean I speed).  Evenutally, I realized it was 
pointless to argue.  Have the rest of you guys had to put up with this kind 
of stuff?  Is reasonably priced insurance for a Porsche possible?  At this 
point I'm thinking of not buying the car, because I've heard of people 
getting dropped just because they bought a Porsche.

Thanks.

Please post that phone number! I've been using Aero-Kroil, from Kano Labs,

Kano Labs can be a pain in the ass to deal with.

John,
      I had a wiring problem with my 944S a few weeks ago. One of
my headlamps suddenly went out while in use. On investigation
I found that the fuse had blown. The replacement fuse also blew.
An hour spent with an multimeter traced the fault to the three wires
leading to the connector behind the headlamp unit.
All three cables are covered in a sleave and after stripping back the 
sleaving I found that the insulation had been worn from two of them
causing a short, and one of those (the earth) had actually broken. 

I think the problem was caused by the wiring not being adequately 
secured and therefore susceptible to vibration. It's now tie-wrapped
just as securely as the other side which checked OK.

Subject: Non Porsche cruzin' story

One night (in 54, I guess) myself and 2 buddys decided to go out cruzin.
Well, we hit all the drive-in resturants and came up with nothing to do. One
of us knew a girl who took tickets at the local drive in movie theatre--he
was sure she would let us in--so we headed for the drive in. Well we got
there and she wasn't working. We drove right up to the ticket sale booth,
looked at the sales person and backed out again. Wellllll one of us said it
was a shame to go home after driving all the way out and that our plan should
be to BACK INTO THE EXIT, in this fashion we could gain entry to the drive in
and no one would be the wiser because they would see tail lights--the
customary view of people leaving. So we drove around the the exit lane,
turned the car around (nobody thought about back up lights being somewhat
tell tale that something was amiss near their exit) and proceeded to back
into the drivein. Well, we got pretty far into the drivein but we seemed to
be drawing the attention of a bunch of ushers with flashlights. We decided to
turn the car around with one of those racecar like manuvers, where you back
up--change direction,downshift and leave the opposition watching--and we
manuvered right into a parked car. We hit him pretty good--he was minding his
own business and being intimate with his girl friend. He didn't know what hit
him. Naturally, the crash sort of attracted attention in the drivein.
Actually, the movie went off and the house lights came on. The ushers
escorted us to the owner of the drive-in and he decided not to  press charges
against us for entering without paying. The guy we hit wanted no part of
reporting the accident--he was driving without a liscense. My buddy,
Thurston's car incurred considerable damage and the owner of the drivein
muttered something about serves us right and called a tow truck. CAN YOU
IMAGINE THE  EMBARRASEMENT OF BEING TOWED OUT OF A DRIVEIN MOVIE WITH A TOW
TRUCK AND YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING AND EVERYTHING. We didn't try to back into
the drivein again.

Armagan, 

  Does this only happen on low speed. If so, then I had a similar
problem with the same tick noise. It turned out that the outer wheel 
bearing on my 944 were loose to the point where turning the steering
wheel would tilt the front wheels to an angle (sort of like toe-out,
only bigger).

It could be something else on you car but do check out the front wheel
bearing and make sure they are properly tighten.  If there is no play
in both of the front wheels then proceed to steering rack trouble
shooting.

Good Luck!

I would like to recommend that you do not use the adj sp for height adjustment
as I mentioned in my previous email. You should use the teeth on the torsion
bars and get the height almost perfect with the adjusting plate screw in the
middle of its travel. Then use the screws to fine tweak the height and weight
balance the corners.
I am just trying to tell you that these plates are advertised for height
adj. but in fact they are not designed for that reason. 
BTW, mine too are built by Sway-A-way.
Do not forget to have a pro align and balance the four corners! makes the car

Subject: 914 hunting

Hi 'philes.

(First, if you're in a hurry, you might just want to skip to "Now, some
questions:" down below. :)

Recently I decided I needed another car that wasn't such a fan of vandalism
that my nice 944S is (a few weeks ago, I was in a parking lot less than 5
minutes and returned to a car decorated with permenant marker - took a few
hours to polish out.) so that I could breathe a little easier driving to
certain Unfamiliar places.

Since I'm no fan of mid eighties econoboxes, I thought a BMW 2002 would be
pretty neat.  Unfortunately the "nice" ones (pre-smog) were out of my
price range.  I'm looking in the $3Kish area.  I did find a very nice
original '76 2002 with all records since new and very stock, I gave it a try
and was underwhelmed.

So, I was unhappy.  Was I headed to mid-eighties econobox land? No!
I found myself thinking thusly: "What could be better than TWO Porsches!"

I recalled that while looking in the paper there seemed to be a fair
amount of 914's in my required price range.  The idea of a mid-engine
two seater targa has always appealed to me, so I circled the ad "1976 914
2.0 excellent xxx-xxxx" and was off.

First, my driving impressions:  wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeOoooooo!!!!

Fun, nimble, very zippy, wonderfully noisey!  Totally, utterly impractical.
I want one.

My girlfriend thinks I'm insane, but what's wrong with a bit of
insanity to go along with your Porsche(s)?

Now, some questions:

The car in question (76 2.0) seemed...well...  bad.  No records, the seller
knew almost nothing about the car, etc etc.

To me it looked like someone started to restore it, and ran out of money.
New seats, targa top, springs/struts/etc.

The car had also been resprayed a year or so ago (judging by the fade).
It was not a good job.  The trim pieces were left on and masked around,
etc.  There were 2 or 3 small visible rust bubbles in both storage 
compartments.  The battery tray was also rusted with all the paint flaking
off.

A question about rust:  How much is too much?  Reading the 914 FAQ,
the battery tray is a very common rust point.  In my $3K price range,
I expect I may be seeing a bit more of this.  Is there a point
where the rust can be amputated fairly easily?  Obviously if the
battery tray is rusted there is going to be some on on the chassis
there too.  Or should I hold out for an utterly rust free car?

The transmission was also pretty much shot.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd
gear synchro's were non-existant.  How much does a tranny rebuild
run on the 73 or later 914's?  This car also had the Euro gear
shift pattern.  How common was this?

The gas pedal seemed to require far more pressure than seems
correct (as much or more than the clutch).  I assume this isn't
normal?

Am I expecting too much from a car marked "Excellent!" for
$3600?  I'd like a car that's reliable, rust free, and well
maintained and preferably stock.  It doesn't have to be beautiful,
I even wouldn't mind "dogged" and "ugly", as long as it isn't 
rusty.  Doesn't have to be a 2.0 either.  I'd prefer a 73 or later,
but again, not a requirement.

Any other helpful 914 tidbits would be much appreciated.

Does anyone have any general info on the reliability of the 911 Carrera line? 
I'm looking at a black '88 and was wondering if there were any problems
specific to that year.  I have heard "buy the latest model year you can
afford...".  What, besides changing oil, would be the maintenance be for an '88
911 w/81K on it?  What work needs to be/should be/should already have been done 
(so I have some leverage when negotiating the price down)?  What are some good
"angles" to use to negotiate price down?  Lastly, what would it cost to put a
whaletail on it?

I'm looking at it tomorrow so any quick advice would be appreciated.  Please e-
mail me directly.

Thanks,
Peter

Subject: '73 911S oil coolers

Hi,

A couple of weeks ago I was browsing through Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance
Handbook and noticed that some '73 911S have front mounted loop oil coolers.
Is that true? My car just has the engine mounted one. I also saw an ad in
Excellence that Lukes and Shorman is having a sale on them. I was just
wondering, was the oil cooler a performance option or is mine missing (I
doubt it)?

TIA,

This was a problem in particular for the 944S.  A service bulletin
recommended removing a long vent line which ran from the can
along the drive side rocker.  Apparently they had a number of
cars whose fuel tanks collapsed in the winter months.

I don't know whether this is your problem.  I would check the vent
and I would also check the fuel return line for damage (kinking).
In fact, just go over all the lines to and from the tank, expansion
tank (in RHS C pillar) and filler neck.

If you get to this step, you might want to first try the following.  Get a
pair of vice-grip pliers and clamp them on the bolt head *real* hard.
I mean *real* hard.  This has, I blush to confess, saved my butt on
both CV and flywheel bolts; never had to try it on a cam bolt (knock
wood).

Welding is also an option.  Never done it myself, though.

As a rule, you have to be really careful to get full engagement when
turning an allen head or triple square head bolt.  The allens just want
to munge.  The triple squares are quite a bit better, no doubt because
their design puts torque on flat faces in the spline head, where an allen
basically puts most of the torque along the face.

So clean out the bolt head with carb cleaner, a brush, or whatever
before sticking the bit in it.  Esp. important for the CV bolts, which
are invariably crud-laden.

It sounds like this is a problem with the power steering.  Its design
is quite clever, being basically torque sensitive.  I am not sure
what will fix things for you.  I would begin by draining your PS
fluid, replacing the reservoir with a new one, and replenishing
with fresh ATF.

You have to replace the reservoir because it contains a non-
servicable filter at its base (I am told).  You will drain the system
by opening a union bolt at the rack or at the PS pump; you will
need new seal rings when you put it back together.

Of course, start by making sure your PS reservoir is topped off.
If you're dry, it cannot do its work.

You could be heading for a very serious moment, it sounds like you have a 
damaged tooth in the rack, probably caused by a kerb - crunch

That rack could seize solid at any moment, what if your steering fails to

Hi,

Sorry this is not a stricly Porsche related mail, but I think there are
some nice people who might help me a bit here... :-)

Together with my girlfriend I'm going to the States 4 weeks in august.
We plan on arriving in Seattle, drive down along the coast to Vegas and
from there go to L.A.

Please respond directly to me (joker@diku.dk) to avoid this thread from
spreading on Porschephiles...

Now the questions I have are the following:

(1) What kind of car should we rent. I'm (obviously) a car-nut, driving
    two 911's daily. But I wanted to try something really american - like
    a T-Bird or something like that. What I want is a V8 that not too
    conspicuous - we don't want to be attacked because of the car.
    (Sorry, typical european fear having heard manu bad things about USA)

    Would a Corvette cab. be too obvious in the Californian traffic? How
    about in L.A. or Vegas?

(2) How much does plane-tickets from - say L.A. - to Hawaii cost?

(3) Are there any Porsche Club events along the East Coast during august?

(4) How much does a 993 cost to rent in california per day/week?

Thanks in advance...

Please mail me directly - don't want to waste too much bandwidth on this.

Looking at the original design, I surmise that the intent was to vacuum up

time to do the timing belt...)  I surmise that its function was terminated
because it wasn't worth the trouble to do it...

The allen bolt (actually a 12-point triple square) is one of the most
difficult bolts on the engine to remove.  I would suggest that you have a
new one on hand before you attempt this.

My advice: 1) do this before you disturb the belts (that way, if you slip,
you don't bend valves). 2) remove the distributor cap, rotor, and sprocket
cover. 3) Remove the mount for the rotor. 4) Hold the camshaft sprocket in
place with a big six-point offset box end wrench and attempt to loosen the
12 point bolt with the good tool. 4) After stripping out the head of the
bolt, get out a 3/8 inch drill and drill the head out. 5) Once the tension
is taken off the bolt, you can spin it out with your finger.

From 13 11/16 - 13 1/2 inches     -  5
From 13 7/16 - 13 1/4 inches      -  4
From 13 3/16 - 13 inches          -  2
Less than 13 inches               -  1  (Had been Lowered)

The following announcement is provided as information for those 
who might be considering attending the Zone 1 48 Hours of 
Watkins Glen Driver Education, to be held July 1-2, 1995

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
944/968 Ball Joint Failure

Vehicles Affected: 944 Series II cars (1985/2 or later or 944s 
of the earlier years (1983-1985/1) that have retrofitted cast 
front lower suspensions. This problem is seen on 944s that have 
been lowered and driven aggressively.

In the interest of maximizing the safety of all entrants at the 
Zone 1 48 Hours of Watkins Glen, cars that have been lowered 
should be set at stock factory ride height. Ball joints and 
control arms should be checked and replaced if necessary.

If a 944/968 has been lowered below factory specifications, it
causes undue forces to be applied to the ball joint and the
lower suspension member, leaving the balljoint and the lower
suspension area prone to failure. Installation of shorter or
aftermarket springs with lower profiles also lend themselves to
contributing to the failure of the baljoint and suspension.

No endorsement of any changes or suppliers is made by PCA, Zone 
1 or its respective members or officials.

Technical inspection for the Zone 1 event will include a check 
for conformation to stock ride height as depicted in the 
attached diagram. Vehicles which do not meet the illustrated 
specification of 13 inches or 33.5 centimeters will not be 
permitted to participate in the Zone 1 48 Hours.

Ride height is to be measured from the fender lip directly
above the wheel to the center of the wheel hub.

(Terrible ASCII art follows) The points are the center of the
wheel (marked with X) and the bottom of the fender lip directly
above the wheel center (marked with Y)

I just ran a "does anybody" request on "Paintless Dent Removal" and got many
responses.  All respondents were favorable and very impressed with the results. 
As long as the paint isn't cracked and the operator is good at his craft
(some referred to it as vodoo), it is a reasonable alternative to the
bodyshop repair.     Costs about $100 +/- per panel. 

There are a number of companies/individuals out there all going by the name
"Dent Whatever" (DentWizard, Dentworks, Dentman, Dentpro...) Trick is to
find a good one local to you.  The Dentworks here in Boston is no longer in
business but others around the country have used a Dentworks and liked their
work.  I found an individual who does work for the local Mercedes & Porsche
dealers.  They use him repeatedly.  

Good Luck.

This is what I am trying to tell you. The clear coat that 
was penetrated and clouded by WD-40 then started to peal off and now
I am left with an area of bare paint i.e. paint without the clear
coat. The edges of the clear coat (where it peeled off ) makes it

I have tried using some Sherwin Williams clear coat but was unable
to hide those lines between the old and the new paint. I didn't use
the rubbing compound but I will give that a try before spraying the
clear coat again.

By the way what grid of sand paper can I use for the initial and the

I am entering my waterpumper in the Brian Redman 500 at Summit Point in

that no antifreeze can be used. This is for obvious reasons, being that
antifreeze somehow  turns into ball bearings once spilled onto a track

(For some reason we are not required to drain antifreeze for Club Racing)
Anyway is there any additive that needs to be added to straight water to

Through all this debate, most of us said if MoMA has a Ferrrari exhibit than 
MoMA is saying thier art.

The problem is, the Ferrari exhibit. According to my sister, MoMA shows art 
and design and the Ferrari exhibit is a _design_ exhibit.

She did say that if Sean intends to represent a Porsche as art then he can. 
It was a short conversation and not being an art expert I may have missed a

Subject: Odds & Ends

I've been a faithful reader of Porschephiles for some time now, and have been
saving up many questions I have concerning my late 1985 944.  I'm hoping all
you knowledgeable 944 owners will be able to help.
1) I just replaced the entire sunroof cable assembly, made necessary since a
cable on one of the arms broke and Porsche does not make individual
replacement parts.  Now when the arms retract into the roof housing, the
motor does not shut off when they are fully in, until you take your hand off
the switch.  The original cable functioned properly.  I have adjusted the
microswitch on the end of the motor assembly, but this has no affect.
2) The fasten seat belt light on the dash randomly pops on when driving, then
goes off again.  No one and nothing is on the passenger seat.
3) The cruise control will hold the speed for a while, then surge faster.  I
have seen and saved the posting about the repair place in Tennessee, but was
wondering if possibly there is a sensor that I should replace first before I
remove the brain controller.
4) The idle sometimes bouces up and down from about 900 rpm to 1200 rpm, and
eventually settles down.  the idle controller valve has been replaced, and
tuneups have had no effect.
5) When upshifting from first to second the gears grind if shifted rapidly,
but no problem on downshifting, and no problem if not shifted rapidly.  The
clutch has been previously replaced .
FYI, the car now has 145,000 miles (I've owned since new) and has had almost
everything replaced at least twice!
Thanks in advance for everyone's assistance.

Subject: Insurance Hassles


Sorry if this is old news, I just joined the list this week.  The reason I 
joined is that I looked at an '88 928 that I was hoping to purchase 
tomorrow.  In any case, I called my insurance company for a rate quote.  I 
should've known something was wrong when the agent who answered the phone 
said to me, "Oh, a Porsche.  I'll have to get a supervisor to call you." 
 When I asked why, she replied "Porsche's arent in my computer because they 
are evaluated on a case by case basis."  I left my name and # and waited for 
a call back.  Finally, I get a call from a supervisor.  First she says, 
"Yeah, we'll insure that car" like she's doing me some kind of favor.  Then 
she quotes me a RIDICULOUS rate.  I asked why it was so high since I'm 28, 
married, 2 other cars on the policy, no tickets, etc... She gives me this 
whole "sports car, goes real fast, blah blah blah" spiel.  So I told her my 
other car was newer, worth more, driven more and also goes pretty fast 
(although that still doesn't mean I speed).  Evenutally, I realized it was 
pointless to argue.  Have the rest of you guys had to put up with this kind 
of stuff?  Is reasonably priced insurance for a Porsche possible?  At this 
point I'm thinking of not buying the car, because I've heard of people 
getting dropped just because they bought a Porsche.

      I had a wiring problem with my 944S a few weeks ago. One of
my headlamps suddenly went out while in use. On investigation
I found that the fuse had blown. The replacement fuse also blew.
An hour spent with an multimeter traced the fault to the three wires
leading to the connector behind the headlamp unit.
All three cables are covered in a sleave and after stripping back the 
sleaving I found that the insulation had been worn from two of them
causing a short, and one of those (the earth) had actually broken. 

I think the problem was caused by the wiring not being adequately 
secured and therefore susceptible to vibration. It's now tie-wrapped
just as securely as the other side which checked OK.

Subject: Non Porsche cruzin' story

One night (in 54, I guess) myself and 2 buddys decided to go out cruzin.
Well, we hit all the drive-in resturants and came up with nothing to do. One
of us knew a girl who took tickets at the local drive in movie theatre--he
was sure she would let us in--so we headed for the drive in. Well we got
there and she wasn't working. We drove right up to the ticket sale booth,
looked at the sales person and backed out again. Wellllll one of us said it
was a shame to go home after driving all the way out and that our plan should
be to BACK INTO THE EXIT, in this fashion we could gain entry to the drive in
and no one would be the wiser because they would see tail lights--the
customary view of people leaving. So we drove around the the exit lane,
turned the car around (nobody thought about back up lights being somewhat
tell tale that something was amiss near their exit) and proceeded to back
into the drivein. Well, we got pretty far into the drivein but we seemed to
be drawing the attention of a bunch of ushers with flashlights. We decided to
turn the car around with one of those racecar like manuvers, where you back
up--change direction,downshift and leave the opposition watching--and we
manuvered right into a parked car. We hit him pretty good--he was minding his
own business and being intimate with his girl friend. He didn't know what hit
him. Naturally, the crash sort of attracted attention in the drivein.
Actually, the movie went off and the house lights came on. The ushers
escorted us to the owner of the drive-in and he decided not to  press charges
against us for entering without paying. The guy we hit wanted no part of
reporting the accident--he was driving without a liscense. My buddy,
Thurston's car incurred considerable damage and the owner of the drivein
muttered something about serves us right and called a tow truck. CAN YOU
IMAGINE THE  EMBARRASEMENT OF BEING TOWED OUT OF A DRIVEIN MOVIE WITH A TOW
TRUCK AND YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING AND EVERYTHING. We didn't try to back into
the drivein again.

Armagan, 

  Does this only happen on low speed. If so, then I had a similar
problem with the same tick noise. It turned out that the outer wheel 
bearing on my 944 were loose to the point where turning the steering
wheel would tilt the front wheels to an angle (sort of like toe-out,
only bigger).

It could be something else on you car but do check out the front wheel
bearing and make sure they are properly tighten.  If there is no play
in both of the front wheels then proceed to steering rack trouble
shooting.

Good Luck!

	Hi Mike and P-nuts:

I would like to recommend that you do not use the adj sp for height adjustment
as I mentioned in my previous email. You should use the teeth on the torsion
bars and get the height almost perfect with the adjusting plate screw in the
middle of its travel. Then use the screws to fine tweak the height and weight
balance the corners.
I am just trying to tell you that these plates are advertised for height
adj. but in fact they are not designed for that reason. 
BTW, mine too are built by Sway-A-way.
Do not forget to have a pro align and balance the four corners! makes the car
track and slide the same right or left.


Good luck, Ehab.

Subject: 914 hunting

Hi 'philes.

(First, if you're in a hurry, you might just want to skip to "Now, some
questions:" down below. :)

Recently I decided I needed another car that wasn't such a fan of vandalism
that my nice 944S is (a few weeks ago, I was in a parking lot less than 5
minutes and returned to a car decorated with permenant marker - took a few
hours to polish out.) so that I could breathe a little easier driving to
certain Unfamiliar places.

Since I'm no fan of mid eighties econoboxes, I thought a BMW 2002 would be
pretty neat.  Unfortunately the "nice" ones (pre-smog) were out of my
price range.  I'm looking in the $3Kish area.  I did find a very nice
original '76 2002 with all records since new and very stock, I gave it a try
and was underwhelmed.

So, I was unhappy.  Was I headed to mid-eighties econobox land? No!
I found myself thinking thusly: "What could be better than TWO Porsches!"

I recalled that while looking in the paper there seemed to be a fair
amount of 914's in my required price range.  The idea of a mid-engine
two seater targa has always appealed to me, so I circled the ad "1976 914
2.0 excellent xxx-xxxx" and was off.

First, my driving impressions:  wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeOoooooo!!!!

Fun, nimble, very zippy, wonderfully noisey!  Totally, utterly impractical.
I want one.

My girlfriend thinks I'm insane, but what's wrong with a bit of
insanity to go along with your Porsche(s)?

Now, some questions:

The car in question (76 2.0) seemed...well...  bad.  No records, the seller
knew almost nothing about the car, etc etc.

To me it looked like someone started to restore it, and ran out of money.
New seats, targa top, springs/struts/etc.

The car had also been resprayed a year or so ago (judging by the fade).
It was not a good job.  The trim pieces were left on and masked around,
etc.  There were 2 or 3 small visible rust bubbles in both storage 
compartments.  The battery tray was also rusted with all the paint flaking
off.

A question about rust:  How much is too much?  Reading the 914 FAQ,
the battery tray is a very common rust point.  In my $3K price range,
I expect I may be seeing a bit more of this.  Is there a point
where the rust can be amputated fairly easily?  Obviously if the
battery tray is rusted there is going to be some on on the chassis
there too.  Or should I hold out for an utterly rust free car?

The transmission was also pretty much shot.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd
gear synchro's were non-existant.  How much does a tranny rebuild
run on the 73 or later 914's?  This car also had the Euro gear
shift pattern.  How common was this?

The gas pedal seemed to require far more pressure than seems
correct (as much or more than the clutch).  I assume this isn't
normal?

Am I expecting too much from a car marked "Excellent!" for
$3600?  I'd like a car that's reliable, rust free, and well
maintained and preferably stock.  It doesn't have to be beautiful,
I even wouldn't mind "dogged" and "ugly", as long as it isn't 
rusty.  Doesn't have to be a 2.0 either.  I'd prefer a 73 or later,
but again, not a requirement.

Any other helpful 914 tidbits would be much appreciated.

Quick tick on an 88 911 Carrera...

Does anyone have any general info on the reliability of the 911 Carrera line? 
I'm looking at a black '88 and was wondering if there were any problems
specific to that year.  I have heard "buy the latest model year you can
afford...".  What, besides changing oil, would be the maintenance be for an '88
911 w/81K on it?  What work needs to be/should be/should already have been done 
(so I have some leverage when negotiating the price down)?  What are some good

I'm looking at it tomorrow so any quick advice would be appreciated.  Please e-

Hi,

A couple of weeks ago I was browsing through Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance

Is that true? My car just has the engine mounted one. I also saw an ad in

This was a problem in particular for the 944S.  A service bulletin
recommended removing a long vent line which ran from the can
along the drive side rocker.  Apparently they had a number of
cars whose fuel tanks collapsed in the winter months.

I don't know whether this is your problem.  I would check the vent
and I would also check the fuel return line for damage (kinking).
In fact, just go over all the lines to and from the tank, expansion
tank (in RHS C pillar) and filler neck.

>4) After stripping out the head of the bolt, get out a 3/8 inch drill and

If you get to this step, you might want to first try the following.  Get a
pair of vice-grip pliers and clamp them on the bolt head *real* hard.
I mean *real* hard.  This has, I blush to confess, saved my butt on
both CV and flywheel bolts; never had to try it on a cam bolt (knock
wood).

Welding is also an option.  Never done it myself, though.

As a rule, you have to be really careful to get full engagement when
turning an allen head or triple square head bolt.  The allens just want
to munge.  The triple squares are quite a bit better, no doubt because
their design puts torque on flat faces in the spline head, where an allen
basically puts most of the torque along the face.

So clean out the bolt head with carb cleaner, a brush, or whatever
before sticking the bit in it.  Esp. important for the CV bolts, which
are invariably crud-laden.

It sounds like this is a problem with the power steering.  Its design
is quite clever, being basically torque sensitive.  I am not sure
what will fix things for you.  I would begin by draining your PS
fluid, replacing the reservoir with a new one, and replenishing
with fresh ATF.

You have to replace the reservoir because it contains a non-
servicable filter at its base (I am told).  You will drain the system
by opening a union bolt at the rack or at the PS pump; you will
need new seal rings when you put it back together.

Of course, start by making sure your PS reservoir is topped off.
If you're dry, it cannot do its work.

 Thanks to all the replies on redoing undercoating. Removing the motor
to do the work seems like a great idea. I *love* to see my drive train

located at the the plate over the layshaft. When the machine shop cleaned
my case they ripped the outside of the shim where it goes thru the threaded
stud that holds the cover. I called Stoddard for the correct size shim and
was told they don't have it and had one that was over size by .01 and it
would cost me 25.00. I can't beleive it's the ONLY part that I skimped on
and didn't replace and now I have a little leak...Oh well guess you live

there is not enough room to tighten them all.
  
   Now on to the part I am looking for.

 On 1966 911's there is a part that is between the velocity stacks and the

I got one yesterday from place in Illinois. The part I received looked like
I could make it work. Aside from the clips that hold the top air box on, and
the fact the the inside ring was not as high as the one that is on the car,
I installed it. The problem is the location of 1 of the retainer clips (the

Sounds like you need to find out why the microswitch is not working properly.
Check it with an Ohmmeter...

MG (Merriam Grimes) has a special welding rod designed for doing this
kind of extraction, particularly if the bolt snaps off below flush.
The coating on the rod protects the threads on the bolthole, as well
as providing some lubrication, and although I haven't tried it myself
I have reports of very good results.

     I am rebuilding my 2.0 liter to 2.2E specs and have few questions.
     
     The conversion consists of a complete rebuild using 2.2E P & C and
     heads.
     
     I just got the parts back from the machinist and the heads required 
     about .018 clean up and the case required about .005 "decking".  Since 
     this will reduce clearances by about .023, I know that the compression
     ratio will go up by about .2 points.  My main concern is piston to 
     valve clearance since I am going to be using "E" cams.  Is anyone out
     there (Bruce Andersion?) familiar with this combination.  I'll do the
     modeling clay thing if I have to, but would rather not.  I am also
     concerned about changes in alignment with the cam tower and chain 
     housings with the machining done.  I have heard of barrel spacers but
     don't know where to get them.

Pull away;-)  I believe the Guvumint gets into the act with this color
of gas issue.  Aviation gas is colored differently specifically so when
the pilot checks the tank they can be shure of the correct gas.  Those
folks in washington also get in a snit about using the product in the
correct application (automotive desile fule vs home heating oil, ok they
may be different but you could run your 300D on home heating oil since
the taxes are much lower).  Some of you pilots out there ought to know
the answer to this one.
	Regarding marketing hype & bizniz 301.  The marketing lingo and
printed reasons frequently have nothing to do with why the product was
made a certain way.  In comodities everybody is desperatly trying to
diferentiate their product from everyone elses.  See the article in the
New Yorker a couple of months ago about the campaign for Stolichnya
Kristal (sp?), they make a big deal about it being filtered through
quartz crystals later they find out thast regular Stoli is also
filtered through the same stuff (change the add nahh) and they don't
know if any other vodka is also filtered through crystals.

Hi Jerry:

I would suggest adding RedLine WatterWetter, which may improve your
cooling, but also contains corrosion inhibitors (the liquid type - don't
get the old, "salmon eggs" WatterWetter).  I'm very happy using this stuff
in a variety of all-aluminum and cast-iron block / aluminum head motors and
I get no perceptible corrosion at all. It's not a gimmick product.

My P car mechanic and friend has asked for the help of the list in
defending his position with one of his other clients.   A new owner of
an early model 944 (also first time Pcar owner) brought his car to
Tim, my mechanic, with oil leak problems.  The car has 96k miles
on it.   He replaced the balance and cam shaft seals and because
the timing belt was oil soaked, replaced that also.  His customer is
irrate because the timing belt only had 20k on it and thought he was
being ripped off.  He also thought it was unneccessary to replace all
the seals.  His customer is probably out of line and some
responses from the list may be helpful to Tim  in reconciling with
his customer. Can anybody testify as to the common occurrence

From: dougie@physics.att.com (doug dykaar)
Subject: RE: 944T Coil-overs

Since you've offered advice on suspension, maybe you can help me too
(that'll teach you):

My 86 951 has 30/24mm (F/R) sway bars, and an otherwise stock (factory
sport) suspension. However, the red caliper conversion required 17" wheels.
With 8.5 and 10s, Street TA 255/40 and 275/40, I find there is no wheel
spacing on the rears that won't rub on the inside front of the rear wheel
well, at least on the track. (That implies, at least to me, that there's
still too much body roll) At the last school (the glen) I spent the whole
freaking weekend buying BIG washers and adding another round after each
run, till I was rubbing the inner fender AND the fender lip!

Ok, so I need a "track" suspension, but which one? I want to be able to
drive to the track, but that's the only requirement. So, escort (is that
koni?), turbo cup (is that Bilstein?), what? I'm leaning toward the non
adjustable (?) turbo cup, VCI is selling for $2300. Any alternatives? would
progressive springs a liitle easier to take in non-track driving? Do I
really need 600# springs? Are the cup springs 400#? Can I leave my torsion
bars alone? (they're a ~mm smaller than the later cars)

I guess I also need factory ride height, so that the fronts don't rub, and
so that I don't dissappear into the woods with the front wheels flapping on
the control arms.

anybody else got any clever ideas? I thought of driving slower, but I'm
already so slow I decided against it.

Yes boys and girls, it's time for another chapter in the "Snake Oil 
Changed My Life" story.

Recently, my '75 911S started pinging under heavy throttle at high 
RPMs (5100+).  Since this is where things are getting really 
exciting, I was rather displeased.  Everyone I talked to said the 
timing would probably have to be retarded (or at least spec'd, though 
it had just come back from a tune-up).

My mechanic (Tony at Heyer Performance) suspected carbon build-up,
and suggested I try a valve cleaner.  I ran thru a tank laced with a
generous 3/4 bottle of RedLine SI-1 injector/valve cleaner, but that
didn't help much--still made bad noises when I revved it up to
check.  About this time Tony started carrying some Lubro Moly 
additives, so I bought a can of Ventil Sauber, their valve cleaner.

After about 1/3 of a tank of hard driving, the car goes right up to 
the redline with nary a hint of detonation.  I am inordinately 
pleased to have my car back in good running order for only a few 
bucks (and the time I *forced* myself to spend leadfooting around the 
back roads <vbg>).  So, once again, an unpaid product endorsement for 
some stuff you add to your car--but this time it has a definite, 
measureable performance payoff (no detonation).

products, and how I've probably turned my engine to slag.  Always

I believe the 911S loop cooler was standard on the 73 Carrera RS, and on the 
911S with air conditioning.  It may also have been a performance option.  BTW, 
the Lukes and Shorman cooler is just the loop, and does not include the lines

Any small holes like this will absolutely kill the performance of
a 911S (and other 911's, though probably less). I test drove a '71 S
with a leaky exhaust before I bought my car and it felt like less than
120 Horsepower! I met the guy who bought it a few years later and 
had replaced the exhaust. He said it made a HUGE difference.
So go ahead and replace it, or at least get it welded up.

Subject: Seeking console for 944

Bummer!


Yesterday my '89 944S2 developed a problem.  The plastic 'hinge' on the
console ripped, so that the console doesn't open & close properly.

To define terms: By console I mean the little compartment which sits on 
the tunnel just to the right of the driver's right side. The movable top 
is connected to the fixed bottom by a thin strip of plastic, which seems 
to have worn out in my car. From inspection, it seems to me that the top 
and bottom are one piece, so I will need both.

This is the 85/2 type.  I imagine that any console from an 85/2 or later 944,
or Turbo, or 944S or 944S2 will fit just fine.

Questions:

	Does anyone have one for sale?

	How much $$?  (Please, not much)

Now you've done it Dirk. This is top secret stuff, not to be confused
with all the snake oil additives. Ventil Sauber is actually drained
from the urinals at Weissach and aged in kegs until Herr Porsche says
"It's time". The actual chemical formula is a heavily guarded secret,
but NMR studies show a high level of Schnapps and some resinous hopps
plus some purple brassicous fluid.

Ventil Sauber is very good stuff, just don't drink it!

Having had the same problem I looked around the second-hand parts places and 
they didn't have any of the hinges (it seems to be a common failure point).

Automotion has a replacement hinge (metal) for about $150 (also other 
advertisers in Pano & Excellence etc).

But my local dealer had the factory hinge for $13! Apparently the hinge is 
now available as spare part without having to buy the whole cassette lid. 
You can buy a lot of plastic replacements for the price of the metal one!

P.S. You don't need to replace the whole lid/base unit. It's screwed 
together - takes about 15minutes to fix.

Maybe yes, but probably no.  You added the liquid to your tank
and it apparently cured your detonation.  That ain't performance,
that's just raising the octane rating.  MTBE and alcohol will do the
same thing, at the price of engine power and, indirectly, MPG.
Which is one of the myths of oxygenated gasses.

You can also cure detonation by retarding your timing a bit.  I
think what your really want to know, Dirk, is whether the liquid
cleaned up your valves or whatever else was wrong.

Depending on how longed it was 'aged', Peter A. may very well have contributed

The H1's are a two blub light with independent adj. Cost appr $400 as 
set

The H4"s are a one bulb light. Cost apprx $65 a set.

Both are halogen and illegal at least in calif. I think they are illegal 
in all states because they are not DOT certified.

I have the H1 in my carrera and love them as you adj each beam seperate. 
You need to adj them yourself as shops won't and can't do it.

The automotion categog has a headlight adj diagram.

As it turns out, this had happened to my 944 sometime before

Any rust is too much but most have rust. Get a few catelogs and ck

cost 1500-2000.

A good paint job original color will cost upwards of $2,000.

Why were struts replaced?? was car hit ran off the road etc.

Always have any porsche cked out be  a Porsche mech. before you buy it.

who when he saw my car, pulled his radar gun and tried to get my speed. Well 
he got it and I was lucky that I saw him first and did not accelerate thru the
gears as usual (then he would have gotten me). This time my detector could
not have helped since I was the only one on the street, but it sure went wild
on the Ka band (this is in San Jose, CA).
