March 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

Growth continues, with about another 30 people added over the last month.
This is pretty amazing. The national PCA board of directors meeting was
held in Houston over Valentine's Day weekend, so I took the opportunity
to mention the list to several people there. Much amusement that we would
spend so much time doing this "and not even get to see each other's cars".

My big project continues to be the 356 engine rebuild. And trying to get
two engines done for the IT and EP 914s for races on March 20/21, and a
spare for "just in case" we decide to go to the PCA Club Racing at Road
Atlanta on the 27th.

Any interest in a Porschephiles get-together at Parade?

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives unless I spool some off of tape (which is unlikely).
Anyway, the newer archives are in much better condition. All in all,
there are about 7 meg of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME. Period. DO NOT FTP between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll
have to take access away. And DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since
it's just too much work. Thank you.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business service where we could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA, and
still plan to put some of the articles on-line for FTP in 
/pub/pca/newsletters/lone-star. If you edit a newsletter or would like to just i
type in articles from your newsletter, you can upload them into the directory
/pub/pca/newsletters/UPLOAD.

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

Porsche Club of Americia.

+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, if you own a car.

Porsche Club of Great Britain
Ayton House
West End
Northleach
Gloucestershire
England GL54 3HG
Telephone : +44 451 860792
Fax	    +44 451 860011

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

BBB '93
                        The Only PCA Hillcross for 1993

On Memorial Day weekend you will once again be able to find Porsche 
people from the Western U.S. and Canada competing in the only PCA 
Hillcross for 1993. The Silver Sage Region is hosting their Bogus Basin 
Bacchanalia for the 15th year near Boise, Idaho. The main feature of the 
weekend is a hillcross on the nearly two mile road that rises over 500 
feet to the Pioneer Lodge at Bogus Basin ski resort.
 
In 1992, 83 people from 10 PCA regions gathered for a weekend of 
friendly competition. Having 51 drivers attempting to make four timed 
runs up the hill was a bit overwhelming, so this year the number of 
entries is limited to 45 drivers (register early!). Other changes 
planned include many changes for safety, having smaller run groups and 
using proven timing equipment from the Bogus Basin Hillclimb Association 
(they run over 100 drivers on the same road on Labor Day weekend). All 
in all, a safe, fun day of hillcrossing is planned.
 
With well over half of the people coming from out of town last year, a 
rally/tour will be provided the second day of the weekend. Rallyists 
will be able to see some of the attractions that make Boise a fast 
growing city while competing for trophies.

When not competing for trophies, participants will find food, beverages 
and socializing in the Pioneer Lodge; which is dedicated to the PCA 
throughout the weekend. Outdoor activities available in the area include 
tennis courts, hiking, horseback riding and hot tubs. For more 
information or a registration form, call Mike or Jan English at (208) 
375-1884.

Subject: I'm considering buying...

Ok gang, a request for info / opinions:

A local shop has a very clean 86 951 for sale.  About 86k miles, they're asking
$9500 for it... pearl white, burgundy leather interior.  The interior appears
to be in really good condition.  I'm under the impression that the left side
was painted at some point.  Very good color match, good craftsmanship on the
work, but I'd guess from looking that it got scratched in a parking lot or
something.

The extent of the service history available is a receipt for work done at the
local Porsche dealership before they closed their doors, about 10k miles ago,
showing replacement of timing and other belts, and general tuneup work.

Questions are:

	- how's this stack against prices elsewhere?  Locally, it seems like a
	  pretty good deal.

	- Can someone with the right info decode VIN WP0AA0956GN157450 for me?

	- Does anyone know of a good mechanic or 951 expert owner near Colorado 
	  Springs I could have look the car over before purchase?  I've looked
	  it over and it seems to be in good shape, and I have a fair amount
	  of experience at this, but I'm not (yet) an expert on 951'isms.  Been
 	  trying to call the pres of the local PCA chapter but haven't gotten 
	  a return call yet... 

Any observations appreciated. 

Bdale

ps:  same shop has a 79 911SC with 64k miles asking $17.5k if anyone is 
     interested.  Looked very clean... but I'm not really a big 911 fan.

Subject: 944 stalling problem

Hello Porschephiles.  Here's one for the tech gurus on the list.
Starting 3 weeks ago, my '83 944 decided it didn't want to go
anywhere very far anymore.  It'll start fine in the morning,
but will just stall after idling for 10-15 minutes or about
500 yards on the road.  And after it stalls, it won't start
again for another half hour or so.  Occasionally, it'll start
if I keep the gas pedal down.  Even if it starts, it'll shudder
as if something is choking the life out of the engine.

After three local foreign car shops, several hundred bucks in
diagnostics, hoses, O2 sensor, tuneups, and hours of ploughing
through the archives of this list, I still can't find any
answers anywhere.  Also, I've noticed a much mentioned problem
of oil in my coolant recovery tank and white smoke spewing out
of the exhaust.  Any relevance to the stalling problem?  The
closest dealership is 60 miles from where I live so I doubt
my car will ever get there.  But I guess I'll have to get it
towed there eventually if I can't find out what's wrong. $$$ :(
Any suggestions/remedies/voodoo will be very much appreciated.

Subject: If you had $5000, what would you do?

Hello,

	Pretend for a minute that I had about $5000, a passion for
hard driving, limited mechanical experience, and limited time.

	I've been looking at 914 2.0's for a while.  About the right
price, but what sort of things should I be looking for?  Will I be
satisfied with the performance of this car?  Will I fit at 6'2"?

	How about a mid-80's 944?  Or how about a late-60's 911?  I've
kind of been avoiding 924's after I heard where they got the
components for that car.

	I'm primarily concerned with performance and price of upkeep.
Autocrossing is a possibility.  But, I'll also need to be able to
drive this car across country a couple of times.  As a college
student, my time and budget for maintaining the car are kind of
limited.  Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks so much,

Gee, this usually gets my attention! I had the intermix problem on my 85/2
944 at around 65k. There is an updated oil cooler housing that I would
recommend getting. It's gonna cost you if you don't do it yourself (I
finally convinced my extended warranty people to cough up for it) I would
check your oil to be sure there is no coolant in it - otherwise *big*
problems if you drive it! Before you decide to start it up make sure you
don't have chocolate milkshake looking oil! In my case the oil only made it
into the coolant and not the other way, so you might be lucky but seeing
that the car is not running well.....I'd still have it towed just in case.

I've found that the price of 944's varies widely depending on condition.
Low mileage "nice" ones were selling for $12-14k last year around here. 86k
miles for a Colorado car is probably much nicer than the equivalent high
mileage cars that we see on the East coast. Some have been abused pretty
badly as daily transportation around here. From another perspective, these
cars can probably be parted out for much more than their cost. They have
alot of very expensive pieces.

>The extent of the service history available is a receipt for work done at the

Was the timing belt retensioned after 2-3k miles? This is very important!
Also, you can get a service history for the car from any Porsche/Audi
dealer (if it was serviced at Porsche/Audi dealers all its life).
Audi-affiliated Porsche dealers have an electronic database of service
information. Anyone have additional/more up-to-date information about
this???

How is the clutch? Conventional wisdom says that clutches seem to last
40-50k miles. The car might be due for a second one soon. Of course this
might also be East coast thinking and the car might *only* be due for its
first one :-). Cost of a clutch job is $2-3000.

No matter what you do, have an experienced dealer/Porsche repair shop check
over the car thoroughly before you buy it! You'd be surprised at what they
might find and how much it costs. Also, plan on spending $1-2k per year on
maintenance over the life of the car (if you take it to a shop/dealer). Any
other estimates on maintenance cost out there???

Don't get me wrong, the cars are fantastic. I strongly recommend getting
one! It's just that their cost of ownership is not reflected in their low
initial price (its reflected much better in the car's original $30k price).

Subject: 914 trans

	I've been collecting parts of assorted 914's and am assembling them
into *hopefully* one car.  I've never seen one together and I don't know
anyone with experience with these cars.  Most of the parts are from a 74, 
and that's the body I have.  My question is this:  I have both a 74 (side 
shift) and a 72 (bottom shift) transmission.  However, the 74 has a broken
rear mount.  The shift linkage on the 74 seems to be a better design, and
because of that I'd like to stay with it.  Is the 74 any better than the
72?  Are the gear ratios different?  Can the gears be switched between the
two transmissions?  If I have to put a new end cover on the 74, I might as 
well get the optimum gear ratio.  What gears would be better for 
street/sport driving with a mild (150-200hp) 2.0 engine?  
					thanks,

Phil,

I am about 6 1.5 tall and I owned a 914-6 for several years with no
problem. My only problem was fitting with a helmet on my head.
So... I obtained an extra used seat cushion, cut it down by about
50% and that solved the problem.

Maintenance will mostly depend on how well the car has been
maintained in the past.  Porsche parts cost more than other cars,
and 911 parts cost more than 914 parts.  Probably the most important
thing you can get is a car that is NOT RUSTY and well maintained.
Even if you pay a little more up front, it will cost you much less
in the long run.  

Even speaking as a 911 owner, I can tell you that 914s are a lot of
fun and handle great.  You probably want a 73-74 914 2.0 for a 4
cylinder car.  Those are the best years.

   and that's the body I have.  My question is this:  I have both a 74 (side 
   shift) and a 72 (bottom shift) transmission.  However, the 74 has a broken
   rear mount.  The shift linkage on the 74 seems to be a better design, and
   because of that I'd like to stay with it.  Is the 74 any better than the
   72?  Are the gear ratios different?  Can the gears be switched between the
   two transmissions?  If I have to put a new end cover on the 74, I might as 
   well get the optimum gear ratio.  What gears would be better for 
   street/sport driving with a mild (150-200hp) 2.0 engine?  

Most parts between the 901 gearboxes are completely interchangeable.
You can freely mix-and-match gears. First you should figure out what
you have in terms of gears and then go from there. 

The best thing you can do to make the gearbox wonderful 
is to put a short ring-and-pinion to lower the effective gear-ratio
of the whole box, then shorten 3-4-5 if necessary. The short ring-and-
pinion is unfortunately difficult to find. The original final drive is
7:31 ratio and the short is 6:29. I believe this was originally found
in the 904. The sportomatic 901 has a 7:27 (mild shortening) but I'm
not sure if that will work.

As for the gears there are so many gears for 901 boxes out there that
you can have virtually a custom tranny if you want. Used gearsets
are plentiful and available. 

Btw, 150-200hp is considerably *non* mild for a 4 cylinder 914. That's
actually a killer engine. Any word from Stan on this?

   Don't get me wrong, the cars are fantastic. I strongly recommend getting
   one! It's just that their cost of ownership is not reflected in their low
   initial price (its reflected much better in the car's original $30k price).

Actually, the cost of ownership IS reflected in the price (although I
know what you meant).  If they never broke and cost peanuts to fix and
maintain, the selling prices would be higher.

The '73 and up shift linkage ("side shifters") are much better than the
pre-'73 models ("tail shifters"). If it is at all possible to retain
the side shifter, do so.

>Are the gear ratios different?  Can the gears be switched between the

All of the 4-cylinder transmissions have identical gears, including final
drive. The gearsets are also swapable with any 901 transmission, such
as found in early 911s, and all 912s, which is the cheap way to get 
different gearing. Otherwise, you buy "loose" gears in a variety of ratios 
for about $400 a gearset (i.e. "first" is a gearset, as is "second", etc.).

Ummm. Well, since we consider 185hp close to the absolute max for a fully
race prepared engine with an average life expectancy of about 15 hours of
operation, the first thing I'd suggest is "wake up, and smell the coffee".
A typical "street/sport mild 2.0 engine" will make about 110-120 HP,
but not have great engine longevity. 

For my ITA 914, which is for what is basicly a stock road racing class, I 
get about 120 HP out of the engine, and based on current wear indications, 
should be able to get probably 3 full years of racing out of the engine. But 
that took a $4.5k engine rebuild, and everything I know about making Bosch 
D-jet fuel injection sit up and bark.  

I'd stick with the stock gears. The only real complaint I have on the 914 
gearing is that 4th and 5th are *awfully* tall...

Hello again.  Sorry if I wasn't clear in my last posting.
I've had all the hoses and also the O2 sensor changed.
Oil and filter have been changed twice in the last month.
Water pump's been replaced last year.  Compression has been
checked twice in the last month also.  I pulled the plugs
yesterday and it seems the car is running rich and leaving
dry, black deposits on the plugs.  I just bought a copy of
the Hayes manual and on page 26, it says the plugs for a
83-87 car should be gapped at 0.070-0.080 in.  Isn't that
a typo?

One final question.  Is there a way to check whether the
fuel pump relay is the culprit in this.  I'm not sure if
this is right but I was told to remove the relay, bridge
terminals 30 & 87b and see if the car runs okay.  I tried 
that alright.   The fan kicked in immediately and I was
blindsided by the steering wheel.  So, I'm checking with
you guys first in case I do something catastrophic.  Thanks

When I took the Jim Russell school, they had an intersting variation
on the skid pad that seemed to me to be much better. What they did was
lay out a sort of oval with cones that could be run either as an oval
or as a figure 8.

The procedure was that each car would run 5 - 10 laps as a clockwise
oval. After everyone had run clockwise, then we'd run it
conter-clockwise, and finally, we'd run it as a figure 8. Better than a
skid pad IMHO 'cause it made you use your steering, throttle and brakes
to keep the car balanced. The encouraged you to push it until you spun,
then back off just a hair and do it again.

For fun after the exercise they ran some 5 lap "races" with 2 cars
starting on opposite sides. If one car started to catch up with the 
other car, they would give th faster car a yellow flag which meant slow
down for 1 lap to increase the buffer space. Lot's of fun. Oh, the arces
were obviously run as an oval, not a figure 8! :-)

They also did and exercise where the took out the comes at one end of
the oval and gave you a running start into the corner so you could build
up a little speed. That worked out great cause they could cycle all 8
cars though constntly. As soon as the first car had exitied the turn
(and the pylons had been reset, if nessecary (which it often was), they
would flag the next car through. 

All of this was done on the Russell Formula Mazdas with the front wings
removed, but it would work well fro street cars too. The day I did it,
it happened to have rained the night before so the surface was wet,
which just added to the exercise.

Subject: Car control clinic

I'm setting up a car control clinic for our club and am looking for
suggestions. My experience is *limited* to running in 30+ autocrosses. Any
help would be appreciated.

We have a large parking lot (approx. 600' x 1200') with no major
obstructions. The plan, so far, is to limit attendance to 30 cars. In the
morning (for 3 hours) we would divide into 4 groups and run 3 excercises
simultaneously (skid pad, threshold braking and slalom). The extra group
would flag. In the afternoon there would be an autocross linking the three
excercises together. Since we are not emphasising the competitive part of
the event (and, not coincidently, we have no timing equipment) we plan to
use stopwatches to time the autocross part, at least the last few runs.

Now for the questions:

Is 30 cars OK? How many instructors would be necessary?

What is a good diameter for the skid pad exercise?

How far away would you have spectators stand and waiting participants
parked? I know the general SCCA rule for autocross courses is >25' from
obstructions and >50' from spectators, but skid pads seem a little
different - something about their mesmerizing effect... Is it a good idea
to put a flagger at the center of the skid pad?

Thanks in advance.

At our last SFR team.net school, we did something similar, only instead
of the figure-8 we added slaloms.  Due to time constraints and differing
student abilities, we started with an oval with a tight slalom on one
leg and an open slalom on the other leg.  Students had several tries at
the oval in one direction, then we switched directions and they got
several more tries.  Beginning students who needed a lot of skidpad work
could ignore the slaloms and just drive along one side, and concentrate
on the sweepers, or could ignore the tight slalom but practice the open
one, while more advanced students did everything at once.  It was up to
each instructor and student to decide when the student could begin
practicing the slaloms instead of driving alongside.

Then after the lunch break, we removed one of the slaloms and replaced
it with an infield section, set up timers and start/finish lines, and ran
timed runs for the rest of the afternoon.

I think this is a pretty common 944 problem, but unfortunately I forget
the exact solution!  I think what it is, is that you have to pull the
climate control module from the dash and clean it.  Jim Selders, didn't
you have this problem?  The CCM is the assembly of sliding and turning
controls in the centre of the dash.  You start by carefully removing the
trim piece over it...

There are a couple of good products I can recommend.  Wurth makes two
sprays: Contakt OL and Contakt OS.  One is a cleaner, the other is a
"preservative" which I suppose inhibits future corrosion.  The other
product, which might be more appropriate to cleaning the potentiometers
in the climate control, is Radio Shack's "lubricating tuner cleaner,"
which does as it says: cleans corrosion and leaves a lubricant.

Plug gap spec is 0.7 + 0.1 mm.  They come new from Bosch gapped
to 0.7 mm, so you can just pop 'em right in.  Porsche recently
told people to stop using antiseize on plug threads, btw.

>One final question.  Is there a way to check whether the
>fuel pump relay is the culprit in this.

It all depends.  If it fails hard, yes, you can check it with
a multimeter and +12 to open a close it.  More often, the failure
will be intermittent and the only "test" is another, presumably
known-good relay.  My VW's Bentley manual recommends a list of
spares one should carry in the car, esp. on long trips.  A spare
fuel pump (ie, DME relay) is one of them, and I bought one last
summer and always carry it with me.  You might want to do the same,
and having done so, you'll have something to test the car with.

Yes, you can jumper these two pins in the DME relay socket to
turn on the fuel pump.  However, keep the following in mind.
Fuel flowing through the fuel pump is the only thing which
cools it.  If you run the pump for very long while the motor
is not running and fuel, therefore, is not flowing, you will
burn out the fuel pump.  So to do this test, jumper the pins
then start the car right away.  If it doesn't start up, pull
the jumper.  Try to keep the test down to thirty seconds or so;
get a friend to help.

As to diagnosing your problem, I think the right first step would
be to scan fault codes out of your DME.  I am not very familiar with
pre-85.5 944's; perhaps someone else can confirm the existence of
the A/B/C/LED test plug uses to scan fault codes in the earlier models -
Bob P, are you out there?

If you do not want to solve the problem yourself, I highly recommend
taking your car to a Bosch Service Centre, preferably one which sees
a lot of Porsches.  Your local PCA should be able to point the way.
If you do want to solve the problem yourself, I highly recommend
picking up a copy of Probst's book "Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine
Management."  It won't (probably) give you the answer to your problem
right away, but it will educate you enough to tackle the diagnosis.

There are unfortunately a lot of things which could cause your problem.
In addition to the DME relay, you could have a bad air flow sensor; bad
electrical connections; loose/dirty/bad grounds; insufficient fuel
pressure due to bad pump, clogged fuel filter, faulty pressure regulator
or pressure damper; bad injectors; leaking injector o-rings, manifold
gasket, or other leaks in the induction system; bad throttle position
sender or idle/WOT switch; plugged up catalytic converter; bad gas;
and probably lots of other stuff.  Chances are, however, that it is *NOT*
a bad DME (aka ECU or control unit).  This myriad of possible causes is why
reading the DME fault codes is so important.

As to the black plugs, it could be that you are running rich.  I would
have thought that, given the work done to date, esp. the lambda sensor
replacement, that someone had measured your emissions with a Sun
analyzer.  If you have been running really rich for some time, it is
quite possible that you have plugged/melted down your catalytic converter.
This is consistent with the symptoms you are having.

Keep me posted on what you learn.  Happy hunting - wish I could be more
helpful.

Amp/hours while the local discount parts places list them by CCA (cold

and figured out what size to get?  I would prefer not to just buy one
and see if it fits...

ps has anyone ever used a towbar to flat tow a 914?  If so, where did
you attach the bar to the 914?

AutoWeek's March 1 issue has spy photos of the 996.  They also report
that the car will have an aluminum chassis, and be 100 pounds lighter
than the current 911.  The wheelbase will be 10" longer to allow a mid-
engine configuration.  Both a water-cooled flat six and a 400-hp 3.9-
liter V8 (from the 989) will be available.  AW estimates 0-60 in the
low 4s, top speed about 200MPH.

Every 944 I've seen has this option. I would bet that it is a cute play on
the chemical expression for carbon dioxide and means the car is equipped to

Ok, this is just a guess here, but since you say that it has been
running rich, I suspect the pressure regulator.  I just recently
saw a BMW 533i with similar symptoms register 100+psi at the fuel
rail.  It should be about 35psi.....

You can check the pressure with just about any guage, you
don't need the special one in the factory manual.  I've used
a mechanical oil pressure guage lately.

On further reflection, I would suspect the reference mark sender.  It is
on the clutch bell housing, which expands as the car warms up.  If its

The challenge to checking 944 fuel pressure isn't the gauge itself.
As Brandon points out, any gauge with a reasonable maximum pressure
is fine. The trick is that you need a special metric fitting to
connect to the fuel rail. There is a treaded stub (7x1 mm, if I
recollect) which has a steel ball to form a seal and then a cap to
hold the ball against the end. You need a sleeve with the same thread
and a ball end nipple with a section of metal tubing, to which the
flexible hose to the gauge can be connected. You may be able to buy
these parts as standard metric fittings, I haven't checked. I ended
up making my own. You may also be able to disconnect something else,
such as a fuel injector, and connect the gauge there. However, you
want to be able to check the pressure with the car running if you can
(the fuel pressure is, or should be, a function of the manifold
vacuum).

I should have mentioned this, but I have used a piece of fuel
hose with a hose clamp.  I just place the hose over the fitting
and clamp it down.  It hasn't leaked a drop for me.  I can't
remember the size of hose that I used, but I think maybe 3/8",
it wasn't anything special.

Simple question: (they all start like that)

My '79 911SC's brakes start to squeal as they warm up. They stop again once
they really warm up but it is very embarrasing when driving into a car park
with the brakes whining away ;-)

I've removed the front pads (the culprits) and the wear looks OK, BUT there 
are no anti squeal shims (a tin plate which goes between the pad back and the
break piston). I took a look the a friends '89 911 Carrera and it's pads have
the shims attached to the pads (it also has slot for a pad wear warning
switch).

Now the question's

	Do all 911SC's brakes squeal like mine (hopefully not)
	Do I have the correct pads (no sign of any shims ?)
	Can I fit the newer pads (shims and wear warning)

Thanks for any help.

Sorry for this .. I lost some of the recent messages, but their content got

My 944S2 doesn't seem to be able to maintain cabin temperature any more. I
can make it hot or cold, but the temp definitely isn't regulated by the
setting on the thermostat knob.

There seem to be 2 relevent things in the cabin:  The sensor, which lurks
behind a removable grill, and the thermostat dial.

When I remove the grill of the sensor, I see a narrow hose disappearing into
the distance.

The regulator knob  doesn't seem to want to come off, and I didn't notice
any fastener screw.

SO, what is the procedure for cleaning this up?

Sounds like the block temperature sensor is whacked.  This little 
sensor (and associated connector) determine the mixture.  In an older 
car, I'd suggest carefully cleaning every electrical connector you can 
find, and maybe replace the sensors for block and water temp.  Clean 
the connector fingers carefully with a sharp, long item, and then spray 
with a chemical cleaner (Freon, etc. - sorry about the non-green solution).

Also check you idle & full-throttle switches for proper operation.  
Your problem does not sound like the O2 sensor.  If replacing all hoses 
and vacuum lines doesn't fix anything, I'd virtually guarantee the 
problem is electrical.

Unless your pressure regulator or damper is bad!

Yes, a gap of .07 is about right - no typo.

I've not  heard of this before, but your system may be "pinning" or 
"pegging" itself towards the maximum temperature it can deliver.  Could 
be a bad cockpit temp sensor.  It's about 12" back from the dashboard, 
at the end of a long black plastic tube that connects to the nostrils 
on the trim strip, near the clock.  If that sensor is bad, it'll 
confuse the HVAC logic and you'll get the described symptoms.

If the sensor's OK, then the brain is shot - get another from a dismantler.

Fred,

In my '86 951 this tube leads to the back of the glove compartment where
there is a fan sucking air and blowing it across the temperature sensor
(thermistor?). You would have to remove the glove compartment to get at
this area. One thing to note, though, is that an '86 951 does not have air
bags but your car does. This probably means that many things behind the
dash were relocated... Have fun hunting!

That's the carbon dioxide option, for US emissions spec cars.  Without 
it, you get no CO2 in the exhaust (P.O.'s the catalytic converter).   ;-))

One thing I didn't mention in my earlier e-reply:  the temperature 
"sniffer" has a little fan in it (the lungs that make it sniff).  
Normally you can hear the whine of this in a garage or other silent 
location with the ignition on (not the engine!).  If the fan is not 
running, cabin temp changes will not be noticed.

Gain access to the sensor by pulling the glove box.

The CCM / hvac computer will go "full throttle" towards your desired 
temperature until it's nearly reached, and will then mix-down the temp 
via flaps.  If your selected temp is NOT without about 2-4 degrees C, 
the CCM will "floor it".  (Sorry for the excessive quoted expressions; 
this is fun!).

You may hear the system switch to recirculate mode too, to reduce the 
time lag to achieve your temperature.  In this mode, the fan noise is 
slightly louder, and operating the recirc. button has no effect.

The plastic bushings are very squeaky and rough for street use. I

I have tried using white grease to lube the Delrin bushings but
it just starts sqeaking again after a short time.

For street use I would recommend putting in new factory A-arms or

my porsche mechanic replaced all suspension bushes, front and rear.
apparently there are some replaceable-type bushes that aren't attached to
the A-arms or radius arms.

i don't think they're worn out again.  i can *see* that the rear ones are
still okay, by looking end-on at the mounting point where the radius arm
attaches to the torsion bar, so i believe the front ones are good, too;
i've only 15k on the new bushes.
 
my mechanic tells me he has used a good weatherproof grease on the
bushings, but given the heavy rain we've had down here in the past six
weeks, it's been unavoidable driving on rain-*soaked* roads.

This is true.  They are also a pain to install.  I've used moly
wheel bearing grease on mine, but it tends to wick out.  I saw a
picture taken by someone who put a grease fitting (Zerk?) on the
metal cap/sleeve around each plastic busing on his 911, and presumably
drilled a "squirter" into the (located) bushing.  In this way, he
could periodically lubricate the inner and outer faces of the plastic
bushing without disassembly.  Wish I'd thought of that!

We may have a set of original rubber bushings from a '74 which we
could part with, Pete.  If interested, make an offer.  Not my decision,
though, and the "other guy" is soaking up the Caribbean sun this week.

Unlikely.  The warm-up enrichment really lasts only a minute or two.
Since Hwee's car doesn't stall out for the first fifteen minutes, my
money says the problems lies elsewhere.

Correct gap is 0.7 + 0.1 mm, which is how they come from Bosch.  Kind

I thought I'd mention this:
 
Pep boys (and others no doubt) make a compact battery with 1000 Cold
Cranking amps and an 8 year warranty.  The batter is about the size of
your average honda batter, i.e. smaller than a 911 batter but weighs
about the same.  It's built with the terminals in the middle (rather
than offset to one side) and also has side terminals.  As far as I can
tell it's truly a one-size-fits-all.  It was $20 cheaper than the
"european" sized 911 battery.  SOmthing relatively rediculous like an
7 year waranty

 
Being that they don't even ask what kind of a car it's going into, it
can be transfered to your next car and they are very good about their
prorated warrnaty - they give credit on your next purchace.
 
In any event, I'm happy with this battery and I like the
transferrability.

check and came up with the following under "Engine Cutout":
  - Ground connections, plug connections (where plug means connector)
  - Power supply for control unit/fuel pump
  - Ignition system (plugs, coil, etc.)
  - Air flow sensor

 Early 914's
    I was just on vacation out in Riverside, CA.  A buddy down there has an

 I know that the "1.7" is really something on the order of 1685 cc, but he

Hi Folks,

battery?  My off brand batteries say "group 36B" - but the first service

	Since having my share of electrical problems in cars, I've been
interested in having a voltmeter and/or ammeter in my 911 (I don't like
idiot lights).  It seems a dual volt/ammeter would be a great alternative
to the clock in the instrument panel.  I've noticed an Upfixen article on
ammeter installation... I've now begun to search for such a beast.  Has
anyone heard of a dual instrument from VDO, any other manufacturer, or
custom built?

	Thanks for your help.

hmmmm, this may explain why i have troubles getting the idle speed below
1400rpm at stock timing specs.  the carbs are *balanced* alright, and idle
mixture real good - a little on the lean side, maybe.  i retarded timing
about 2-3 degrees from stock (on an 009) to get the idle *speed* down to
1100.  dwell is within specs (damn, i hate messing with point gap; hence,

does this sound like worn throttle shaft bushings symptoms?  could i be

geez, if i have to get them rebushed, i might just put them on the

Hmmmm. Well, the actual "1700" engines were really 1679, supposedly all
the way back to engine number W0 000 001. 

However, the factory had this annoying tendancy to build "car du jour",
particularly in those days (to the annoyance of 356 and early 911 owners
everywhere). So it's *possible* that he wound up with some kind of sub-90
mm bore from some early 911, but it's *HIGHLY* unlikely.

The only thing that would possibly shed any real light on this is the 
build sheet off of the cardex. You can get some of that info from Reno,
but only if it's a really, really special car can you get additional 
assistance from the factory.

Having driven early 914s, I can attest that you'd swear that they had much
smaller engines that they did, just based on expected vs. actual performance.

Subject: 914 vinyl roofs

My '74 914 2.0 is due to go into the bodyshop in a few weeks for restorative
surgery (left longitudonal and jacking point) as well as cosmetics (new
paint all around).

I've been planning to remove the vinyl both from the sail panels and the roof,
and paint the entire car white.  The sail panels seem OK, if I just leave the
aluminum trim in place, but has anyone removed the vinyl from the roof?  
Checking (without ripping the vinyl off yet) seems indicate that there is a
shallow indentation in the roof along and above each side window.  Yet the
cars with painted roofs in VW & Porsche don't seem to have this.

Is this a deep indentation?  Can I (should I) just have it filled?  And what
kind of finish is the roof under the vinyl -- is it almost ready to paint or
does it need extensive prep work?

I'd appreciate any tips from anyone who knows something about painting 914
roofs -- I don't want to rip the vinyl off until I know it'll be OK under-
neath!

Thanks in advance...

I have to apologize.  The early 944's apparently did not have the plug.  It
appeared in the 85 or 85 1/2 cars (unclear from the wiring diagrams).  I
don't know how to trigger the fault codes.  On our KE Motronic Jetta, you
put an LED across two pins, then trigger the scanning out of codes by
jumpering other pins.  I can get a definite answer if no one else on the
list knows the trick for 944's.

(My 944S has a completely different Motronic.  And according to Porsche
the MY 87 944S was not instrumented for reading fault codes.  However,
I had the box open this week-end to upgrade the PROM, and while there
checked it out.  It does seem to have all the diagnostic pins connected
to real stuff on the boards, and the test plug is indeed in my DME
harness.  Weird.  So I may try to find borrow at 9268 test tool and see
whether it works!)

Bob, the reason I don't suspect anything in your list for Hwee's car is
that it shuts down, I believe, pretty repeatably after 15 minutes and
won't restart for a half hour afterwards.  Those sort of repeatable, time-
dependent symptoms generally rule out more intermittant kinds of sources,
like a bad ground, relay, or flakey pot.

What he has is something which takes about 15 minutes to fail, every time.
So we look for something which it takes fifteen minutes for a cold motor
to do.  Warming up and expansion of parts fits the bill pretty well.
There are some things which, if they were bad, would get better with a
warm engine, such as a leaking injector o-ring.  There are other things
which get worse with a warm engine but would do so much sooner than
fifteen minutes, such as cold-start enrichment and the lambda sensor.

I'm pretty sure a walk through the official test procedure will give the
answer, especially when the car dies predictably.

Maybe. Depends on what you plan on doing with the car, and HOW YOU PLAN TO
DOCUMENT FOR THE FUTURE THAT THIS CAR HAS HYDRAULIC LIFTERS. There are ways
to do the conversion so that it's NOT obvious to the average mechanic that
it's been converted, and you can really, really screw things up trying to
apply normal mechanical lifter adjustment techniques on a car with hydraulic
lifters. Don't inflict that on some future owner.

I did some checking around -- the guy who I use for my 356 service (factory
trained on the 356, 914, early 911, and 914/6) charges $90/carb plus parts and
shipping (the carb, not the parts), estimate $100 each net. I have no idea how 
that compares, but in general he's been lots cheaper than everyone else I've 
used for anything else (example: 911 engine rebuild to factory spec, $1400 plus 
parts; to full-race, $2400 plus parts; 356 to factory or "hot street" spec, 
$900 plus parts; he doesn't approve of racing 356s so no price there 8{P ).

If you're interested, let me know. I can put you in contact with him.

Are you sure? I don't think I've ever seen a car battery with over 500

Subject: RE: 944 Heel & Toe

Fred,
     Sorry for the late response, and I do agree with you about the pedal
placement on the 944S2.  My '89 S2 was also difficult for me to heel & toe
the same way that I had learned in my previous '83 944.  The '83 setup had
the pedal arrangement so I could use the ball of my foot on the brake and
roll the side of my foot to reach the throttle the same as Tony Eggers
responded.  This worked well for street driving and autocross, but sometimes
was a problem on the track.  As Steve Tynor mentioned, heavier brake usage
on the track did result in a lower pedal which meant some adjustments were
needed to my technique to keep from reving the engine higher than I had
planned.  This was a little more difficult than rotating your foot less
because the pedal effort was also alot higher.  Be prepared to modify your
learned technique slightly when you get your car on the track.  Jim Selders
suggested that the pedal height would be about the correct height on the
track, probably for this same reasoning.  I don't know what particular car
he was referring to and I have not yet had my S2 on a track to check this
out.  The S2 brakes are much different than on the '83 944.
     Anyway, back to my S2.  I was surprised that the pedal setup was so much
different on the S2 than the '83.  Since I had learned on the '83, I like
to heel & toe on the street, and I mostly do autocross, I decided to modify
the throttle pedal.  Laforce suggested a wood shim, which is definitely the
simple, low cost approach, but I wanted a more exotic appearing solution.  I
took a piece of aluminum, folded one side for stiffness, punched a set of
holes for traction, and mounted it to the pedal on one inch plastic shims for
correct height.  This works well for me and looks "trick" -- kind of like the
new RX-7 Turbo advertisements.

I had the opportunity to play with a really bad top from a parts car I had
several years ago, and it is not at all the way you are implying.  The
roof panel is not covered with the same material as the sides and roll bar:
the roof is fiberglass and it is covered with some type of 'coating' which
is given a texture.  It can't be peeled off like the sides.  I think you'll
need to sand it somehow.

I'm not knowledgable about bodywork and painting, but I believe that with
this type of roof panel, after you get the black coating off, you'd need
to put a sealant on it and then use a very flexible paint.  The panel is
prone to twist and bend during handling (or if your frame is not up to
standards :)  ).

Some of the pictures in magazines or parts catalogs may be metal roof
panels welded in, if they wanted the car to be like a 916.

just checked my 928 battery to make sure... it's from grand auto (no
particular name brand), but it says 750 CCA on the top of it.  i guess
i could believe the existence of a 1000 CCA battery... :-)  of course,
there could also be a difference between what a battery says and what
it actually produces.

Subject: 911 batteries for 69-73 911

My 69 911T has one of the OPTIMA sealed lead acid gel-cell batteries.
It fits on its side in the drivers side battery pocket.

The passenger's side battery pocket is left empty. 

The battery looks like a re-branded Gates gel-cell battery.

I believe I bought it from AUTOMECANIKA (sp?) in Colorado.
It has worked fine for several years.  

Since this car is in Northern California, it rarely sees the
cold weather starts of other regions.  And it is cranking
a 2.0 low compression engine, so the battery may not be suitable
for larger displacement/higher compression engines. 

Since a leaking battery in a 911 can cause expensive rust problems
in the front suspension mounts, the sealed construction gives me
a (false?) sense of security.

A couple questions on books:

What all is in a Technical Specification book?  If I have the full

I've seen prices on these ranging from $6.85 to $14.95.  Are these the

I'm looking for a copy of a book called Project 928, about the

Subject: Re: Tech Specs Books

Monty, there is no book titled "Project 928" it was a series of
articles that appeared in Pano July 91, Aug 91 & Sept 91.

Kim Krumb added all of the go-fast gizmos that any of the
sponsers were willing to donate and basically summerized.

Too bad he didn't do any type of quantification of the data
though.  Another thing I would like to add is that he started
with a "Gray Market" car, sure it's a decent model to start out
with in that the Euro cars had alot more HP, but they are
very uncommon (relatively speaking) and use CIS injection.
I came away after reading the articles with mixxed impressions
as you can probably tell.

Still it's well worth the read.  Call up the PCA and order the
copies or contact me directly and I'll fix ya up.

As far as the tech-book goes; I feel it's a good quick ref. and
you don't have to carry around the bulky set of manuals, although
all of the material in the tech-book is covered in the manuals.

Later Donald Day.

The tech spec books are pocket-size references containg mostly the numeric
information you would find in the workshop manuals, and none of the
exploded diagrams or procedures.  The mechanics I hang around have the
tech spec booklettes sitting on top of their toolboxes or in the top left
drawer, near to hand.  The workshop manuals and test plan books are put
away butm available for education and back-up as needed.  Porsche being

Subject: 944 DME test codes

Just to add a bit more to this thread, my shop manual sayeth:

"As from model year 88, the DME control unit 944S is capable of
self-diagnosis.  That is to say, the control unit is capable of
detecting, storing and displaying system errors.  The control unit
capable of diagnosis is identified by an altered part number.
A specially developed diagnostic tester (special tool No. 9268)
is then used to read out the error memory and to test specific
components and control signals of the fuel and ignition system."

This agrees with Kevin's remark that this capability was not available
for MY 87.  Unfortunately, the manual gives no clue as to what is
"altered" in the part numbers of control units capable of readout with
tool 9268.  One of the codes displayed by 9268 is the "control unit
type" (1 = LH/DME, 2 = EZK).  According to my Baum Tool catalog, tool
9268 "reads self diagnostic fault codes on DME LH-EZK injection
equipped models, 944 from 1988).  However, I can find nothing in my
manuals that indicates any hope of being able to read codes out of
anything but the 16-valvers.  Of course, the turbos (at least my '86)
have a port (forward of the central electric panel) from which codes
can be read to diagnose the knock/charge control system (using tool
9246), but not the DME proper.

 -Milo

P.S.: Baum lists tool 9268 at $633.

A friend at work just replaced his zenith carbs with webers and his
marelli distributer with bosch.  I think it was also a '71T.

Sez he can't believe the difference!

I couldn't believe the prices he quoted me for marelli parts!  Something
like $100 EACH for cap and rotor, should you be so lucky to find them.

He paid about $500 for the distributor, and about $800 for the carbs.

Bruce Anderson (everyone wave toward Sunnyvale) wrote an article about
this change a few years ago.  George saved it.  Bruce recommends the 
distributor from an 911L for the 'T (if I remember correctly).  The
difference is the advance curve.

Subject:      914 starter problems

Hello, I am a new member of the list, and would like to float a problem
I have been trying to sort out for 4 years. I have a 75 914 which has
an intermittent problem turning the engine over. The way the problem
appears is usually after running the car for a longer period (>1 H), but
it can occur with shorter (1/2 hr) highway runs. The engine refuses to
turn over. Sometimes the problem will go away when the car cools down,
but sometimes it still wont start when cold. However, even when hot,
after a push start, the starter will work fine. The starter and
solenoid have been replaced (for other reasons) without avail. I have
gone through and checked every connector and connection from battery
to ignition switch to solenoid. Taking the solenoid out and cleaning
it makes the problem go away, but it tends to come back over time.
I have had suggestions of shielding the solenoid with thermal insulation
which I have not tried yet.
Does anyone have experience or suggestions r.e. this problem?

This problem is infamous and of course chronic on all models of the
914. The accepted "fix" is to install an aftermarket solenoid. Many
Porsche parts places sell this kit but if you want to save a little
money just go purchase a Ford starter solenoid like from a 1985
Mustang. The cost should be under US$10. This is the same exact 
part they sell you in this kit!

By the way, I have no idea why this works. If anyone knows the
actual reason for this problem and why the external solenoid works
I'd love to hear about it.

Subject: Sandblaster equipment questions...


	Howdy all,

	Sorry for the cross posting, but I know that this is not
really part of any one list.  There are a number of people who
restore/work on cars scattered about, and I am trying to reach
them....

	In any case.  I have started on the official fixing up der
914's project.  These cars have some areas which are REALLY rusty.  I
would like to be able to clean them off and repaint them instead of
replacing everything.  In order to be able to do this in a reasonable
amount of time I am looking into getting a sandblaster.  The problem
is the different types that are available.  Which one would work best
for me, do you think?  I have a 4 HP / 80 gallong single stage
compressor (I believe that will make a difference).  I summare the
three different type of sand blasting equipment below:

1)	Simple/inexpesive stick hose from nozel into a bucket of sand

2)	Siphon system in which the sand blasting material is pored
into a large plastic bucket and is siphoned into the nozel (probably
more efficient then the previous)

3)	Pressure system in which the sand blasting material is
actually kept under pressure. (this is probably the most efficient
system, but is also the most expensive)

	Which of the three preceding systems would be the most
efficient in the use of the sand blasting material, the compressed air
I have available (a real issue), and work the best?  I would expect
that the third option is the most efficient compressed air wise.  I
hate to have to wait for the compressor to spool back up time after
time.... Will this be a problem with options 1 and 2?

	Any and all comments/suggestions appreciated, Alex

From: js@aixservr.egr.duke.edu (Jeff Shorey)
Subject: Re:  914 starter problems

The reason why the external solenoid works is that there is enough voltage
drop to the ignition key and back to not satisfy the old starter solenoid's
needs.  You could also be missing the ground strap from the transmission to
the bottom of your trunk...  There are a couple a reasons I can think of for
not getting enough voltage: the ignition switch's internal contacts are dirty
or the wiring to and from the switch is old and oxidized.

911's have these same sort of problems - I've got a solenoid on mine.  They
are probably amplified by the fact that the battery is in the front of the
car, thus the ground return path is through the body of the car, and since rust
does not conduct electricity very well, some of the older cars will have
problems.  On my car, I went so far as to run a 6 gauge ground cable from the
battery directly to the transmission.  This didn't solve anything however - I
ended up swapping out a bunch of starter solenoids until I found one that
worked.

Subject:      914 external start relay

Thanks for the quick replies.

Is the external solenoid being used simply as a relay to get current
to the solenoid on the starter? (i.e. the voltage drop through the
wiring to the ignition switch keeps the built in solenoid from pushing
the gear into contact with the flywheel but would be enough to
energize a solenoid which only activates a relay?)  Presumably the
voltage drop would be exacerbated by the increased resistance in a
hot coil, explaining why heat can bring it on.

Subject: Re: 944 DME test codes

OK, I have the answer.  There are two ways to get the fault codes out
of a 944 equipped with the test plug.  As Milo mentioned, you can pop
for the P 9246 tool, whatever that may cost.  This is covered in the
944 Turbo '85 DME/KLR Test Plan.

Apparently the 944 Turbo '85 Service and Assembly manual tells you how to
do it with just an LED.  (I don't have this document.)  This would apply to
any 944 equipped with this test plug.  The procedure is:

 1. Go out for a drive.  Since you are trying to exercise faults with the
    engine, I would suggest varying the RPM and load to try a little of
    everything.

 2. Bring the car back home, leave it idling, but do not shut off the motor.
    Shutting it off causes all faults codes to be forgotten by the DME.

 3. Connect an LED across the "LED" and "15" pins of the test plug.  Again,
    this is a five-pin plug mounted in the fender forward of the Central
    Electric Box (CEB).  It normally has a protective cap over it.

    The pins are distinguished by one of them which stands clear of the
    others, centred in a block.

                                C
                                |
                                v
                            _________
                           /    O    \
                          /-----------\
                  LED->  | O         O |  <-15
                         |             |
                    B->   \ O       O /  <-A
                           \_________/
   
    While the car idles, connect the negative lead to the "LED" pin,
    the positive lead to the "15" pin.  The DME stobes the LED by
    taking the "LED" pin to ground.  It apparently has an internal
    resistor, because you do not need to put one in series with the
    LED.  Btw, an LED with a Fresnel lens will making reading it much
    easier.  These are, I am told, available at Radio Shack.

 4. By turning the throttle cam, briefly raise the engine to 2000 RPM.
    The LED should come on.  Important point: the DME will scan fault
    codes only if they exist!  So if you get no light now, and no
    fault codes, be happy.

 5. After the light comes on and you drop the engine back to idle, the
    DME will stobe out two-digit fault codes, one after another.  There
    is about a four second delay between each digit, and an eight second
    delay between successive fault codes.  After scanning out the last
    extant fault code, it starts over with the first.

I don't have the typing skills or patience to type in all the codes.  If
anyone does go through this exercise and jots down codes, I will be happy
to look them up.  Credit and thanks to Bill Pfister at European Performance
here in Mass. for filling me in on the above procedure.

A few things to keep in mind.  First is that some faults mask others, and
having identified and cured one reported fault, you should go back and
check for others.  Another is that the fault code diagnosis is not perfect;
it is the best analysis which the DME can make of the signals it has to
work with.

Finally, be careful.  DME's are expensive.  There was a spedometer, DME,
and a radio fuse from a late-model 911 sitting on the counter at EPE last
time I visited.  The car's owner had somehow managed to destroy them all
in the process of jump-starting his car.  No idea why, but we suspect he
either crossed the jumper wires or jumped from a car with a bad voltage
regulator.

Philip, I am sure you are right about when the test plug showed up in
the 944 series.  All I have to work with are wiring diagrams and my own
humble steed.  The wiring diagrams and workshop manuals are not always
in complete synch with shipped product, although they are extremely good.
Milo, if you have the test plug, and it is wired to the DME, I would bet
you can get the codes.  (By "DME", I really mean both the DME and KLR
control units.)

For what it's worth, I was also told this news by Walter Piescik, who owns
Klasse 356, a reputable 356 parts supplier in this area. He was told by NPR
that the sales volume just wasn't there to justify the continued manufacture of
these units. It is too bad because for the average street engine, they did
lower the cost of a rebuild by $6-700. 

My guess is that another manufacturer will soon pick up on the demand for
economical P/C sets and start producing a similar set for $3-400. In the

Greetings Porschephiles,

Well don't you hate it when you are driving your Porsche home from work (On an
infrequent occasion) and you are stopped in the traffic, you hear screeching and
then a loud bang followed by your car being bumped forward.  Yes my car was hit
from behind by a destitute student without insurance yesterday afternoon.  Not
too much damage - probably only ~$1500 or so..... B-(.  My insurance also has a
$500 excess on P-cars.

Can't say the same for their car, the front looked a bit totaled... B-)  As if
there is any justice in this world....  I can't get over these people on the
road without at least third party (property) insurance.  Obviously they have
more money than brains, more likely none of either.

Anyhow while I was getting the quote at the crash repairers this morning I
noticed the manufacturer sticker with the option codes on it.  Can somebody
decode these for me, it is a 924 turbo 1982 model:

	C40
	261
	398
	423
	425
	431
	650
	651

As far as I know it has a 4 spoke steeering wheel, and a standard manual
sunroof.

Sorry to hear about your mis-fortune, but these things happen. In December
1991 I was sitting at a traffic signal waiting my turn to go when I was hit
from behind by a woman doctor driving a very large Cadillac quite a bit over
the speed limit. 

Now it's bad enough to get hit this way in any Porshce, but in a 911, I
fully expected the worst. I got off lucky. The woman had insurance, and
since she (a) had significant assets I could attach in the event of a 
successful lawsuit, (b) had freely admitted to several people that she
was speeding and did hit me, and (c) had hit someone in a Porsche, her
insurance company gave me no trouble at all. 

I wound up with new rear bumper guards, a new rear bumper, a lot of new
interior metal in the back, new SSI heat exchangers, some minor engine 
service, a new left rear fender, new and correctly tinted glass for the
rear of the car (Targa, where there's more glass than almost anything else)
and lots of smaller things. I got the body shop which did the work to pull
the tub back to exact factory spec on the chassis alignment, fabulous work
on the rest of the body and paint, and even had some of the door and mirror
paint chips refinished while they were at it. And someone else got to pay
for all of it.

Admittedly, that's a far cry from being hit by someone with no insurance,
but there are some positives in this experience. Since you do have to have
the body work done, make sure it's done right, and that the tub of the
car is correctly aligned -- it may not have been before, but it by gosh
can be now! Try to get your paint shop to handle the various small nicks and
chips "for free" while they're working on the car, or at least for cheap.
And while you're deprived of your baby, remember how much you hate driving
something else -- then remember that once you get it back and start getting
unhappy about the cost of service, etc!

Let's see, now, the 20th... that could happen, but it doesn't sound too
likely from here. Lime Rock probably got about 2' of snow this weekend, and

Subject: 914 power



Thanks for all of the info on the 914 trans.  As you may have guessed, 
I'm new at building a Porsche, and therefore my knowledge is limited.
I mentioned wanting 150-200hp out of a 2.0 motor, and was quickly notified
that the hp of race motors was only 185.  The specalist who built my motor
said that the power output should be about 140 hp with dual Webers.  I had 
planned on adding a Jacobs ignition box (reported ~15 hp boost) and a ram 
air system (should be ~10 hp boost).  This gives ~165 hp, what I hoped to 
start with.  My question is now:  are these figures right?  If it is any 
lower, how does the 2.0 motor take to turbocharging or a occasional nitros
injection?  Actually, the latter is my preferance, due to the lower cost 
and space efficency.  I would limit the systems to 200 hp, to save the
driveline (and my rear tires).  Are there any unexpected problems which I 
might encounter?

Hi All,

Well, I delayed acting on a recommendation to have my clutch master
and slave cylinders replaced (leaks observed two weeks ago), and this 
morning the pedal went to the floor.  So I'd like to know:

1.  Is there any way to get enough hydraulics back to limp to the 
garage, or must it be towed?

2.  Previous discussions alluded to how difficult it is to bleed the
system - is the rest of the job as bad (such that I should not succumb
to the "I'll do it myself" impulse)?

3.  I had one ballpark estimate of $250-300 to do this.  Is that a 
reasonable price?

Thanks for your assistance,

You *might* be able to get the thing going again by refilling the
reservoir and pumping up the clutch pedal until some pressure
builds up. It will take *alot* of pumping though.

P.S. Anybody like to have a guess at the cause of this one:  Sometimes, on
my 85/2 944, when I take my foot off the accelerator, the engine speed
doesn't decrease, so that instead of slowing down my speed remains
constant and I have to declutch to get the car to slow. This is
intermittent and seems only to happen at slowish speeds. The car is due a
12k service soon, so I'll probably get it looked at then, but my guess is
a sticking throttle cable.

Snake oil alert! There is a thread on the z car maillist about the Jacobs
ignition box. The conclusion was that it is full of hype, and that a multiple 
spark ignition is better and has more realistic claims.

I've never had trouble pumpig it up for 10 minutes to get thigs going in
various cars, clutch or brakes.  (912 brakes, 2002 clutch, TR-7 clutch,
Renault GTA brakes).  Just add fluid till full and pump a few times, check
the fluid, if low, add more, keep doing this cycle until you feel that the
pedal is good, and then check that clutch operation is good, that with the
pedal on the floor, the car does not creep and the shifting is smooth, and
then drive gently and all will be fine.

Yup. And that's with the trickest stuff you can buy and some Double-X Secret
trick head work developed over many, many, many years of making Porshce go 
fast -- sort of your basic $10k motor. At least, that's what I'd have to sell 
one to you for if you wanted to buy one or have one built.

>My question is now:  are these figures right?  

Nope. You *CAN* get ~130 from a 2.0 with dual Weber 40IDA's *IF* you do
everything else right. The Jacobs claim is bullshit, and "ram air" is similarly
overrated. I'd expect *MAYBE* another 5HP from the pair, but most likely a
net loss as you're very likely to do something to upset the carbs in the
process.

Even if you go to say an Electomotive TEC II engine management system, with
Berg throttle bodies and crank-fire ignition, (net on that will be > $3k)
you still won't break 150HP. To do that requires all kinds of stuff that
leaves you with a motor that won't idle below about 1500, and usually involves
re-sectioning, porting, and flowing the heads. Not to mention what you have
to do on the exhaust side, and now that you're making all that extra power, 
needing to go to a full dry-sump oiling system with dual pressure stages.

Yup. All kinds of problems. The bottom line is you can do either or both
of these things to the engine, but you'll pay for it in drasticly reduced
engine life, and typically with catastrophic failure rather than just
"Tired Engine Syndrome" when it starts to go.

Let's start with Number One: HEAT. We're talking air-cooled engine here, 
with some oil cooling. When you do *ANYTHING* to pump up the horsepower, 
you have to do something to get rid of the heat. So, what can you do? With
a turbo, you are pumping heat back towards the engine! Not to mention the
added heat of the turbo unit itself.

If you want to use a remote oil cooler, you'll need to have a higher 
displacement oil pump, which you have to split the case to install. 

Both turbo and nitrous solutions add a tremendous load to the bearings
and tension on the rod bolts. You need to have installed Carrillo rods
or equivalent at the rebuild. The turbo may over-boost you so much that
you start having the metal in the pistons or heads start to "flow" from
overpressure and extra heat of combustion. You'll need to worry about that.
You also have this problem with pre-ignition due to super-heated parts in
the combustion chamber, so you'll need higher octane gas, possibly in the
race-gas range if you don't do something to lower the basic compression 
of the cylinders BEFORE you start adding boost. And finally, you have all
kinds of fun induction problems. You need to go to some kind of programmed
EFI with a turbo system, as it's really, really hard to make a "blow through"
turbo system that works reliably.

Let's see: by my best guess, to add a turbo and not blow everything up, 
you'll need yet another rebuild, done right and done for a turbo setup
which means Carrillos, TRW or Arias custom pistons, and loads of other
stuff; you'll need to have a turbo and intercooler system *engineered* for
the car since there aren't off-the-shelf parts for this; you'll need to
probably use the TEC II for fuel and ignition control, particularly since
you want it to work right; and you may need some body mods to accommodate
all this plumbing. I'd say you and do it for maybe $10k.

You know, for less than that you could convert to a 911 engine, and MAKE
your 200 HP. Lots less trouble, too.

There's no free lunch. If there was, I'd have already figured out how to
eat it 8{)

Others have suggested adding fluid and pumping untill you have a
pedal. By all means do that, if you can. If you can't get a pedal
that works that way, you can drive the car without the clutch.
Put the car in 2nd gear without the engine running. Crank and start
the car in gear. Try to time stoplights, and creep through stop signs
without disengaging the clutch. You can do remarkably well that way.
On some cars, you can shift to higher gears (and back, if you need to)
by matching speeds without using the clutch. VW beetles do this just
fine, 901 Porsche gearboxes don't (at least not for me). I don't
know about 924's, but I would guess they would work. The problem with
the 901 box (early 911, 914) seems to be the Porsche style synchro's,
which I believe they didn't use in any of the front engined Porsches.

I would go ahead and try it. At worst you will end up with a spongy 
pedal, and you will need to pay someone to power bleed it. you will
still save the labor and parts markup on the basic repair (whatever
caused the leak).

YES! This is one thing you can do to really improve the handling of
your Porsche without spending a dime! (or should I say the *only* thing)?

The easiest way to lower the rear of a 911 is also the only way. You
are going to have to remove and reset the position of the rear torsion
bars. 911's after 1978 do have a small degree of adjustment built into
the spring plate, but the '73 doesn't (exception RS). This is a fairly
involved process but fortunately requires that you replace nothing.

911/914 front end torsion bars have built in adjusters that make
adjustments to front ride height very easy, only an 11mm wrench is
required. Again, no parts are required.

You can definately do all this but keep in mind balance/alignment will
have to be checked during the process or else the car might drive
down the road sideways. (well it won't be *that* bad).

SALON INTERNATIONAL DE L'AUTOMOBILE - GENEVE 1993
 
PRESS CONFERENCE
 
SPEECH OF DR. WENDELIN WIEDEKJNG,
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF PORSCHE AG
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
I would like to cordially welcome you to the Porsche press
conference at the Geneva Salon and thank you for your
interest. We are well aware that the Porsche name continues
to have great fascination for many sports car fans, but we
realize as well that we must work constantly on this
fascination. We see this as a permanent investment in our
product and can assure you that we will continue to do so. 
 
As you know, Porsche is currently going through a difficult
period. But that doesn't mean we are lamed. Quite the
contrary: you yourselves have shown us great trust and
strengthened our confidence in recent times. We are not
surprised but we are pleased nonetheless, when our new-
model presentations and novelties are positively received.
I need only mention the latest example: our new Porsche 911
Turbo 3.6 which we presented in southern France during the
first two weeks of February. 
 
The media response was exceptionally good for a car which
costs more than 200.000 marks (in Germany). We feel that
this confirms our decisions since this is a sports car of
the very top class, one which we believe will completely
satisfy fans of sporty driving. With this car we have
demonstrated the development potential contained in our
turbo concept: improved performance and a sensational
torque increase to 520 newtons with simultaneously low fuel
consumption prove that our concept was correct. The 911
Turbo appeals to an admittedly small but very loyal buyer
circle, one we have no intention of abandoning. 
 
Our new 968 Club Sport version also met a positive
reaction, not only attracting true sports car fans from the
beginning but also documenting what we mean by "value for
money" with its favorable price-performance ratio. 
 
Both models, the Turbo as well as the 968 CS, can be seen
on our stand here at the Palexpo. As well, of course, as
our Boxster model study, first shown in January, a car
which certainly recaptures the lead for us in the area of
sports car design. If you will permit me a euphoric
formulation - we stole the show from most exhibitors in
Detroit with this study. According to a survey by Report
International, this Boxster was the model most often
mentioned in the European press, of all those shown in
Detroit. 
 
As you know, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Boxster provides an
idea of the shape which our future sports car might take,
when we put it on the market in 1996, in the price segment
between 70.000 and 80.000 marks. We are working with total
engagement and high creative application on development of
this model and we are confident that it will give our
company decisive financial impetus. 
 
Only a year after that new model for the middle price
segment, based on the Boxster, we will introduce a new
model to the market, in 1996/97, for the upper price
segment. Up to that time we will continue to develop our
current range, consisting of the 911, 928 and 968 models.
In the course of the coming months, further model
innovations will follow the 928 GTS, bunched in 1992, and
the variants 968 CS, 911 Speedster and 911 Turbo 3.6, as
well as the special 968 Turbo S model. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to present another
Porsche innovation at this time - alongside our product
lineup: Porsche Engineering Services (PES) will
considerably expand its performance spectrum. Alongside
traditional customer developments, PES will also offer
future services in product planning as well as small-series
assembly. Expansion of the PES performance spectrum becomes
possible through restructuring of the production area of
the Porsche AG. Production specialists from Zuffenhausen
will now plan and implement solutions for automobile
industry customers, alonside engineers from the Development
Center in Weissach under a newly-established contract
production Cost Center. 
 
The special strength of Cost Center contract production
lies in small and middle-size series to fill customer
contracts. These range from component production, through
raw body building, to assembly of complete vehicles. 
 
This notably expanded performance spectrum for PES makes
the Porsche AG a supplier of complete systems, from vehicle
and component development through to production. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are taking the opportunity of this
Geneva Auto Salon to celebrate a truly worthy anniversary:
our 911 model range turns a youthful 30 this year. In 1963
we presented this model, which has become synonymous with
the Porsche name like no other, at the International
Automoblile Show in Frankfurt. At that time nobody, not
even our own people, could dream that we were launching a
success story without peer in the world with this car. 
 
The now-classic silhouette of the 911 has lost none of its
original attraction in the past three decades - to the
contrary, it has gained even more. This shape is just as
timeless as that of the famous VW Beetle which emerged
almost exactly 30 years earlier from the design and
drafting boards at Porsche. The Porsche 911 - and this is
truly sensational - has posted more victories in its
thousands of races than any other sports car. And even
though the car was conceived 30 years ago, its technology
never stood still - the 911 was always a leader when it
came to top performance in automobile construction. To name
each one of them would exceed the time frame of this
meeting. This is why we have prepared a special press kit
for this amazing history alone, which you can pick up here
or on our stand. This material shows in documentary detail
why the 911 has even defeated the course of time: it
remains as fascinating as it was on the first day - in
everyday road use as much as on the race track. 
 
And in this context I am especially pleased that Porsche
could obtain the exclusive services of Mr. Walter Rohrl for
the current season. Mr. Rohrl, who is also present here and
today, enjoys wide appreciation among sports car experts
and on the circuits, due not only to his driving skills but
also to his pleasant, upright style. He will start for us
in the most varied races and be available for PR activities
as well. We are certain that we succeeded in obtaining Mr.
Rohrl's cooperation so quickly because he too is totally
captivated by the fascination of this 911. I can say
without hesitation that Rohrl is infected with the Porsche
virus. 
 
What's more, we are taking the opportunity of the 30th
anniversary of this outstanding sports car to present you
with a worldwide exclusive today, the 911 anniversary
model: a wide-body car based on the Carrera 4, with special
trim details, the anniversary color of violet metallic,
matching silver anniversary logo and the sole, convincing
911 script on the tail - also in silver. 
 
This anniversary model will be produced in an edition
limited to 1500 units and offered at a price of around
143.000 marks (in Germany). The car carrying number 911
moves directly from the assembly line to the Porsche
Museum. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, join our celebration. Our stand
offers the 911 anniversary model, alongside the Boxster,
Turbo 3.6, 968 CS and the new Speedster based on the
Carrera 2, which we will introduce to the market in April.
But you will also find three models in our new, Exclusive
Trim, an exquisite program of special options which leaves
no wish exclusiveness unfulfilled. 
 
All these new items should document that Porsche will soon
overcome its current trough through solid efforts. This is
why I want to repeat what I said in Detroit, on the
occasion of the Boxster presentation: our vision is
stronger than the perceptions of our critics.

Both ends of the car are sprung via torsion bars which have splined
ends. Simply take things apart, and re-insert the splined part into
the mating part a couple of splines offset from where you started.
The proceedure is covered in the workshop manual.

Now for the caveat: doing this decreases your travel on the same old
tired springs. To really get the most out of lowering the car, you
need to increase the spring rate at the same time. Which involves
replacing the torsion bars with new bars of slightly larger diameter.

Hello everyone,
A few weeks ago, I posted a note about my '83 944's hot stall
and start problems.  I also mentioned that the hoses have been
replaced but last weekend, I found a hole in the hose leading
into the vacuum canister (thanks Kevin).  The shop that replaced
the hoses really screwed up.  Anyway, the car runs fine now (albeit
it's only been a few days).  I'd like to say thanks to all who
replied.

Also, does anybody know how to check if a coil is bad?  I checked
mine as stipulated in the Haynes manual.  The primary resistance
registered 0.6 ohm (which is within specs) but the secondary
resistance between terminals 1 & 4 measured infinite impedence.
Thanks in advance for the help.

Subject: Front end noise - 931



I lowered the front of my 931 about 1.5" by installing some 220 Lb
springs sold by Performance Parts.  This is actually the second set of
springs.  I also tried a set of 200 Lb springs from Automotion.  In an
attempt to eliminate squeaks from the front, I replaced the Automotion
units with the latest ones.  It thought it was the dead coils rubbing
together.  Wrong.  The latest set still makes the noise.  It sort of a
metal against metal grinding sound in the suspension, primarily when you
dive the nose of the car stopping.  Not the brakes, etc.

So..  After crawling under the front and using lubricant to see if I can
find the culprit, I think I have it isolated to the links from the sway
bar.  Lowering it has placed the bar at a 30-45 degree angle, causing
the link to rub against the hole in the bar, the best theory I have at
this time.  Lubing the area seems to make it go away for a day or so.

It looks like I need some shorter links, but my two catalogs (Automotion
and Performance Parts) have nothing, except for some adjustable ones
used with the Weltmeister bar.  I don't think they are going to work. I
think they use Heim joints on their bars.

Has anybody faced this problem with a 924/32/44/51 and found the
solution, short of buy a new sway bar or going off to a machine shop to
modify the stock links?

Don't know what the legalities are in Solo II, but Accusumps are allowed in all
classes of road racing, and dry sumps are allowed to be retrofitted in SCCA
Production and above. 

Now, what's the difference?  Accusump and dry sump solve some of the same 
problems in a very different way. Both provide a method for keeping pressure
to the bearings under almost all conditions, both provide an extra  N
quarts of oil (2 <= N <= 10), and both provide an extra "heat sink" capability
to cool the extra oil.

An Accusump is a pressurized cylinder (using air pressure) that stores oil
when you have more pressure from the oil pump than air pressure, and sources
oil under pressure when you don't. Easiest way to install an Accusump on 
914/924/944 variants is to get an spin-on oil filter remote plate (gizmo with
oil filter threads on one side and 2 5/8" NPT ports on the other), the
right fittings for that, a similar sized "T" fitting, some hose, a remote
oil filter mount kit, a one-way check valve, and an Accusump. Plumb this with
the pressure port of the oil filter replacement plate going to the oil filter
remote thing, then the check valve, then the "T", then back to the engine. On 
the "other side" of the T, put the Accusump. BTW, you can also add an oil
cooler at this time -- in the return loop, on the other side of the Accusump. 
Anndd, this is a *GREAT* time to toss you old spin-on filter and use a *REAL* 
filter, the Canton/MECA replaceable cartridge unit. Oh, doing this on a 
356 involves machine work and welding to add a "full flow filter" instead of 
the normal bypass filter, and you don't do it at all for 911s. And, if you do 
an get an Accusump, get the 3 quart version.

Dry sump uses at least two oil pumps, and cannot be installed without
case dissassembly and modification. The first pump, the scavenge pump,
picks up oil from the sump and shoots it to a storage tank. The second
pump, the pressure pump, picks up oil from the storage tank and send it 
into the engine. The scavenge pump must be about 2x the capacity of the
pressure pump, which doesn't need to be as big as it does in the "normal"
wet sump case as it's getting oil under gravity feed from a tank. There
are some wierd things you need to do to make dry sump work really well, 
like electonicly controlled cutoff valves in the line from the tank to
the pressure pump (so you don't drain the tank into the sump when you
cut the engine off), a de-foaming tank prior to the storage tank, and the 
usual oil cooler/oil filter stuff. Like I said, you have to modify the
case to change the way that oil flows from the pump, and you usually
have to do welding and machining for the extra fittings you need to use
to move the oil around. 914's are relatively easy to dry sump, as it's
pretty similar to doing same to a Type 1 VW engine and there are lots of
parts available in the SCORE/HDRA world for this. Doing 924/944s is harder,
but you get to use external belt-driven pumps, which you can get in the
Formula car or NASCAR world. Doing 356s is just about impossible. And 911s
come that way from the factory.

The above descriptions should give you an idea what's going on. You can
install an Accusump in a 914 in a morning, and a total cost of under $300
(using barbed fittings, hose clamps, and regular rubber oil pressure hose,
and assuming you get the 3 qt. with the electronic valve. Add another $90
for the Canton/MECA oil filter, and what, $150 for an oil cooler) 

Installing a dry sump in a 914 usually costs about $1100 in parts, welding,
and machining, not including the engine re-build you sort of get the 
opportunity to do while you have the case apart. And takes, well, a long time.

My street 914 has the standard wet sump.  My ITA 914 has an Accusump. The 
Ghost Racing EP 914 is dry sump.  Your choice.

Before you decide that the "limited power" of a reasonable 2.0 914 is not
enough for you, let me encourage you to see about getting a ride in someone's
car that makes power in that range. You'll be really surprised. About 150 HP
in a 914 feels more like about 400 in a medium-to-large American-type car
(Yup. I used to build them too.) Not to mention the *HUGE* performance 
advantage you already have with a *LIGHT* mid-engine car, with a *VERY LIGHT*
engine.

Well, there's one guy in the Houston area who has a Chevy 350 in his 914, but
everytime he comes to an autocross, he blows something -- oil lines, water
lines, head gaskets, etc. 

Second caveat on that: when you change the engine, you *WILL* screw up the 
suspension and brakes. You basicly have to re-engineer the whole car to deal
with a new weight and more imporantly, weight distribution. Not to mention
the various reinforcing you have to do to the tub to keep from getting that
600 pound V8 in the front seat with you... And all that will get expensive in
a hurry -- worst case is you'll need to semi-tube frame the car, which should
only be about $6k, plus needing *REAL* brakes (vented 20 or 24 mm rotors with
large calipers). If you use Porsche A or S calipers, you can do that for about
$4k (you'll need the new front end parts, and Vellios's trick $1k rear trailing
arms that take 911S or SC rear brakes); if you use Bremtek, it's about the
same but you get bigger brakes; if you use JFZ or Wilwood, you can do it for
less but will have to engineer some parts needed to make it work.

>How is the suspention affected?  

Simple. More weight, in a different location, will change the spring rates 
and dampning needed to keep the car stable under all directional loading.
Not to mention changing the rates needed to give you a given ride height.

>Are there any other ways of getting decent horsepower?

Look, you're about to spend a zillion dollars on putting something together
which will only be unstable and *EXTREMELY* expensive to maintain. So why
not take a different approach? 

Sell your 914. You should be able to get $3-5k for it, depending. 

Then go buy (your choice): 

* an MR-2 Turbo, about $8-10K; 
* a 911SC, about $9-15K;
* an early ('71 or '73) 911S (*BIG* horsepower, light car), about $10K. 

Or better yet, get a penis extention, since that seems to be what you're

Rod Simpson (or Stimson?) is the originator of the Porsche/V8

Southern CA, LA area. Apparently he has been doing this since the
sixties and he's the ultimate guru.

My opinion on this has flip-flopped over the years. I am now at
the stage where I think it's a bad idea, for many of the same
reasons Stan has mentioned, namely cost and general ugliness
of the finished product as far as integration of all the elements
is concerned. I admit to only having seen one of these beasts
in person and that one was a complete butcher job. Basically to
do it right you are going spend *big* bucks.

A far better option is to *bolt* in a Porsche 6 cylinder. 
Expensive, yes, but not so much when you consider the completed
job will be far more smooth than a V8 shoehorn job. Also,
the 901 trans is capable of staying together with a hi-po
2.7 ltr whereas the stock trans would blow up with a V8.
Consider also the handling aspect, the flat-6 is a feather-

First of all - I am not trying to be some arbiter of taste but
Stan's remark re: anatomical addititions was out of place,

Now that is off my chest:
The 914-6 is a sweet, extraodinarily well balanced 'go
so fast your heart cramps' car. 
What do you end up missing
if you put a 911 motor in a 914-4. Are the 914-6's running
gear, etc very different? I seem to recall they are much the 
same.

What do you need besides the motor? Headers, exhaust, oil tank?
I would think, with the scarcity of 914-6 and the plentitude
of 914-4 this would be a natural. Used 911 motors aren't all
that expensive if you look around.

   could you elaborate on the procedure?  i'd like to lower the front end of
   my 912 about 1/4" - 1/2".

Sure. Keep in mind this procedure does not include alignment and
balancing for optimal handling:

Instructions for adjusting front ride height 914/911(65-89):

The front end of the 914/911 suspension consists of two lateral
torsion bars that are splined at each end. The front end (toward the
front of the car) is fixed and the rear end is set into an adjuster
which maintains a variable pre-load which is used to adjust the
ride height. Adjustment is made by simply changing the arm length
of the adjuster. It is really very simple when you look at it.

1. Locate the adjuster. It is at the rear of the torsion bar, one
for each side. The point you are going to turn is a threaded
shaft with an 11mm head for a wrench or socket. The head is facing
down. Immediately aft of this piece is the rear bushing for the
A-arm.

2. Turn the adjuster. Tightening (turn clockwise) will raise the
front. 

3. Loosening (anti-clockwise) will lower the car. 

All of the above should be done with the front wheels on the ground
if possible and in small increments. Count the number of 1/4 turns
you make on each side so you can bring it back if you need to. After
each turn,  shake the car up and down to settle the suspension. It
may take a few miles of driving to actually realize the new ride 
height, after which you might need to adjust again.
 
If you get to the end of the adjustment range and find that the car
is not at the height you require, then you have to reset the torsion
bar on its splines. The following description applies to this case
only and is *much* easier to follow if you are looking at the parts:

Instructions to reset the front torsion bars.

1. Jack up the front of the car. Place on stand. 

2. Completely remove the adjuster bolt and the adjuster from the
rear of the torsion bar. 

3. Mark the position of the torsion bar against the crossmember.

4. Pull the torsion bar readward until it is unseated from the 
front splines. Now, looking at the torsion bar along its length
from the rear, turn one spline clockwise to lower or one spline
anti-clockwise to raise. One spline should be enough for even the
most severe alterations.

5. Replace the adjuster on the rear splines in a position so that
you can put the adjuster bolt back in.

NOTE: The number of splines in the front of the bar is different
from the number of splines at the rear of the bar. This gives a 
fine degree of adjustment when resetting the bar.

Enjoy!

   What do you need besides the motor? Headers, exhaust, oil tank?

Front engine mount. The original engine mount on the 914-6 is a
single centered mount that is welded to the firewall. Conversions
typically use an "engine bar" which mounts to either side if the
914 chassis, just like on the 914-4. This is a superior mount in
many ways. If you go this route you'll need a modified shift
linkage bar. 

914-6 Engine sheet metal.

Various and sundry oil lines.

Depending on the engine choice a new flywheel and clutch.

You need:

* headers
* electric heater setup to compensate for the fact that you can't 
  get 914/6 heat exchangers (if you want heat)
* oil tank (better plan on using aftermarket in non-stock location)
* oil lines and misc. plumbing -- filter mount, etc. (made to mate with 
  your tank, etc.)
* fuel system -- lots of choices here, Weber 40IDA3C being "canonical
  choice" but CIS and "custom EFI" being OK as well
* mods to allow you to have a hand throttle and choke actuator
* wiring harness
* engine sheet metal
* motor mount bar ("Quick-6" or similar)
* maybe new flywheel, clutch, etc. depending on choice of engine
* maybe new starter depending on choice of flywheel
* maybe suspension upgrade, depending
* maybe brakes upgrade, depending
* maybe alternator upgrade, depending

You can get most of this stuff as a kit (well, semi-kit) either from
George Stevens at Stevens Machining/RadTechRacing, or Mid-Engine Mania.
The hard part is dealing with the oil system. You just can't get stock
tanks anymore. So you need to use a non-stock dry sump tank, and that
means mounting in a non-stock location. What do choose depends on any
number of things. I personally like the Stevens tank, which replaces the
whole stock battery mount position (sheet metal and all) with a 20 quart
tank, using AN fittings. He also has 911-to-AN conversion gizmos you need
to make the lines up, but it means you can use fabricated Aeroquip lines
instead of having to figure out how to adapt the Porsche parts.

Or, you can wander off into racing land, and snarf some of the solutions
the guys building GT-2 914/6's use. In any event, you give up the front
trunk as you either put the battery there or the oil tank there.

I may have forgotten a few parts, and I have *CERTAINLY* glossed the
details of how to do a conversion. 

If you get serious about doing a conversion, give me a shout and I can
dig out my notebooks, and go from there.

Hello

My 87 944S has always made a nice low rattle when in neutral, clutch  
in. I have always thought that this was just the gears rattling, and  
was not a problem.

Recently however, the car has been doing slightly funny things. Like  
when I am under full acceleration, the car vibrates a bit. Also, I  
can feel the syncros when I shift (not much, but noticible after  
driving my VW). The final thing that worried me was a low whine that  
appeared to be coming from under the car when I pulled into the  
driveway (in neutral, clutch in). A few clutch pumps, and it was  
gone, but...

Could my clutch release bearing be on the way out, or am I just being  
paraniod? Also, what is the reccommended interval for replacing the  
clutch hydraulic fluid, and would old fluid contribute to (slightly)  
rough shifting. If the bearing, how difficult is it for the home  
mechanic to replace (standard tools, no jack, cold outside)? Is it  
something that I can ignore till spring?

On the other hand, this might be just be a case of my driving a BMW  
for a week, and I am overreacting. Then again, it might be something  
serious, like my clutch is worn out and needs replacement, or the  
bearing, or motor mounts, etc... That doesn't seem too likely since I  
haven't felt it slip, but the vibration on hard accell makes me  
wonder...

Yes, it is.  I get it.  Subscription inquiries to 800 877 5602.  As to why
more magazine stands don't carry it, it is because you are all watching

As to the "best" magazine, feh.  They are all a little too close to their

PAG or PCNA does, and Excellence is the same with their aftermarket

You have many of the same issues, but it's a lot easier to get 911 parts
than 912... I think that there may be some modifications needed in the 
motor mount area, and you have to do whatever it takes to install the
oil tank, etc.

Re: 914 power.

Yes, the V-8 conversion can be done and done well.  A friend of mine has
a very well done 283 chevy ( built!) in a 914.  The car looks stock but is
VERY fast.  However, the cost to do a similar conversion CORRECTLY is at
least as much as necessary to buy a real 914-6 outright.

I owned a 914-6 which I had replaced the 2liter 6 with a 2.7 and aluminum 
flywheel and webers instead of fuel injection.  The car looked stock, but
was very fast...considerably quicker than my 911SC.  I was able to outdrag
late model corvettes out of the tollbooths (not that I would ever do or
condone a little street racing). One can buy 914-6s with bigger motors for
far less than it takes to do the conversion oneself.  Check the Panorama and
Excellence Ads regularly and be patient.

I have seen 3liter 914-6 conversions which were blindingly fast and not all
that expensive when it came time for sale.

With the exception of the whine, I've also been noticing similar
symptoms recently; I was thinking the vibration might be wheel
bearings, but now I'm not so sure.  8 000 miles ago, the garage
(official Porsche service agent) told me the clutch plates were
on the way out, and to be easy on the clutch, but the clutch
action has got no worse since.

Still on the subject of 87 944S noises, just the last few days
I've been noticing a distinct 'buzz' in the exhaust note when
accelerating and on the overrun in the 3-4 000 rpm range; I've
no idea how long this has been going on, as this week has been
the first for months in which I've driven with the roof raised.

   Yeah, mine does that too - the garage says they all do.

I'm not sure if this applies to the '87 944S but:

One failure mode of the 944 clutch is that the rubber center of the
clutch disk disintegrates partially long before the linings are
worn down. I don't know why this happens but it manifests itself
as a vibration that occurs at various engine speeds. If the rubber
is completely gone then the clutch will begin to make rude clunking
noises.

One thing to try is opening the plastic access port under the car 
at the transmission end and grab the driveshaft. There should be
zero play in the driveshaft. If there is any play the rubber center
might be shot.

Hi All:

I've been a Porschephiles reader for a while now and would
like to ask this distributed collection of Porsche knowledge and experience 
a question. I'm considering changing the headers/heat exchangers on my
stock US '77 930 to the Euro version.  I anticipate that this will improve
performance below 3K RPM. Bruce Anderson's book also says that
this is one of the first things to do on the way to better performance.
However, the book doesn't elaborate on how much of a job this is. Is it a
matter of unbolting the stock US headers from the heads, turbocharger, 
and wastegate and bolting-on the Euro version? I'm not that lucky!

I can see 4 areas where problems could potentially occur. This is at
the turbocharger, the wastegate, the muffler, and the oil return
line. From photos in Mr. Anderson's book, it appears that the turbocharger
attachment point is the same and that the wastegate bolts-on in a new
place and has its own small muffler. This means that the muffler
must change or that the wastegate outlet pipe attached to the US
muffler must be plugged (if this is even possible). Finally, the
return oil line that goes from the left front side of the engine across
to the oil tank appears to be in the way of the Euro exhaust's left
side crossover pipe. Does this oil line have to be replaced too?

I've also noticed a lot of stainless steel headers on the market and
wondered what these had to offer over the Porsche Euro exhaust. In addition
to looks and longevity, is there more?

Anyway, thanks for your help.

How exacty light is it?  I'm estimating around 2000 lbs.  If so, then I don't

Austen Healey, a 250 hp Sunbird, a 150 hp VW Bug, a 500 hp 930, a Kellison J-6,

That's one thing I was expecting, which is why I prefer the rotary idea.  I'm 
not that familiar with them, but they seem to have the size and weight I want.
Is anyone familiar enough with rotarys to tell me if it would be a good choice?
I recieved no responses on that, but I'd appreciate some.  Anyway, with the 
mid-engine design and foward radiator placement, the weight distribution would
not be altered that much, even with the V-8.

Actually, I've already started building a full tube frame in it.  I know that 
I want some power, and have heard that 914's have a habit of flexing under hard
driving (which I have a habit of doing).  I don't see where you came up with 
the price of $6k, I've built entire tube-frame off-road race machenes for under
that price.

I'm not familiar with "A" or "S" calipers, however the person I purchased this
from had already installed an entire 911 system, with stainless lines and 
braided hoses.  I was assuming that this would be adequate for the lighter 914.
Do you think that it will be enough?

Well, yes, I know that.  Actually, I was looking (and still am) for someone
with experience with this type of modification to give me specific spring and
valving rates.

I was under the impression that 914's were stable and fairly good handling
cars.  My first choice is the rotary for its weight keeping near the 914
motor's weight.  Even the weight of using a V-8 is given at 2300 lbs by
companies who have been doing this for years; I don't think that it would be 
that unstable with appropriate spring, shock, and sway bars.  I can't see how
maintance can be that much more expensive than a stock 914 with the exception
of trans and driveshaft/CV joint breakage because of the added power.  The 
rotary has low torque (I've seen several in the state of tune I want:
~200 hp / ~150 lb/ft torque) and so even this should not be a problem.

Not right now.  It's pieces are filling two seperate garage bays.

The reason I'm doing this project is not to have a mass-produced sports car.
I've owned enough of them, and have built enough vehicles from scrach to know
that this is what I want.  I'd rather not own a car that's just like 
thousands of others, and I want more performance than that given by these cars
(when they're stock).  I'm looking for a rather unusual (looking and 
mechanically), good handling car with about 10 lbs per hp, low emission 
standards, and a major project is preferred.  In fact, I'm starting easy by
not building the entire car from scratch.  (which was my original idea).  If 
anyone else has any ideas, I'd love to hear them.

I was afraid someone might suggest this one :-)

I almost hate to admit this: About a week ago, I got the car stuck on  
a snowbank. While trying to get it off, I inadvertently kept engaging  
the clutch while the parking brake was on. Dumb me. I was told awhile  
ago that screwing the rubber thing was easily accomplished by revving  
the engine up and then dropping in the clutch. It is possible that in  
engaging the clutch with the P. brake on (stalled the car a few  
times) that I might have eaten the rubber thingie.

Then again, I found this morning that if I let my foot off the gas  
while driving over ice patches on the road that I felt the same  
feeling (intense shocks of vibration) as the wheels hit the ice, then  
the road, then the ice. This might have been what I felt yesterday,  
since I can't seem to re-create it on dry pavement. The vibration is  
still there (slight), but only during full acceleration.

Checking my records, I found that I replaced the clutch and bearing  
at about 80K miles, or about 35K miles ago. I would suspect that I  
still have about 20K more miles on this clutch before I screw around  
with replacing it. In the meantime, shoud I take it to Porsche for a

Subject:      914/6' and various motors

Since were discussing 914/6's I have a few questions:

Are 914/6 2.2's taken straight from early 911 motors?

Is there a size difference between the block of a 2.2 and a 2.7, because I know
 that 2.7's used in a few 916's.

Is a 2.7 911 motor just as easily put in a 914 as a 2.2?

Does anyone have any info on the 914/8's made for Ferry and Ferdinand by the fa
ctory circa 1973?

Thanks for the answers, Chuck "Wanting a bigger penis" Canale

It's a 2.0L, but, yes, it's basically the early 911 motor.

Well, I've seen Ferry Porsche's car (the other was built for Ferdinad Piech,
then the chief of development at Porsche, and now the chairman of Volkswagen
AG) at the Porsche Museum at the factory.  It's a nice-looking car, with
little touches like wide pop-up headlights.  The engine is a Porsche 908
motor; Piech's was pretty much in racing tune, while Ferry Porsche's was
detuned for better driveability.

I'm happy with my 2.0L one...  :)

   muffler must be plugged (if this is even possible). Finally, the
   return oil line that goes from the left front side of the engine across
   to the oil tank appears to be in the way of the Euro exhaust's left
   side crossover pipe. Does this oil line have to be replaced too?

You will need replace two lines. The main line from the engine that
you mentioned can be replaced with one from the '74 911 which wraps
around the bottom of the transmission instead of going past the exhaust.
The part is PN 911.107.739.10. This is a solid line. Then you need the
line from here to the thermostat which has a rubber part to it,
PN 911.107.729.10. Please make sure you check this out before ordering
because I might be off on the exact PN but it's a good starting point.
This is the same conversion you would need if you mounted early
exhaust on an SC or Carrera with a front cooler.

Subject: 914 power


   That's one thing I was expecting, which is why I prefer the rotary idea.  I'm 
   not that familiar with them, but they seem to have the size and weight I want.
   Is anyone familiar enough with rotarys to tell me if it would be a good choice?
   I recieved no responses on that, but I'd appreciate some.  Anyway, with the 
   mid-engine design and foward radiator placement, the weight distribution would
   not be altered that much, even with the V-8.

The Mazda rotary would be an excellent choice for such a conversion,
and if you did it you wouldn't be the first. Kennedy Engineering in
CA makes an adaptor plate to mount the Mazda rotary to the 901 trans.
Also, Beetle owners have done this for years.
The Mazda rotary comes in two forms, the 12A (early) and the 13B. The
13B has been used in RX-7's since 1986. I'm not considering the very
first rotaries from the early 70's here. You want to look at the 13B
because it's more robust and has a larger "displacement". Also, there
is a turbo variant that is quite powerful.
>From my experience the rotary is a very light, compact unit. Its also
very simple from a mechanical standpoint. 
There is a *huge* aftermarket for rotary hi-po add-ons. One of the 
biggest names is Racing Beat 714-779-8677. It is possible to squeeze
200 hp out of the 13B without too much trouble. 
As far as advice goes, if I were gonna bolt a 13B into a 914 I'd
look for a good low mileage turbo motor from a 87 RX-7 turbo and try
to mount that in the car using the Kennedy Engineering kit.

Hmmm. Well, if you tube frame the car, and do it right, you can lighten it to
under 1600 lbs by doing enough selective surgery to the original tub. Possibly
down to 1400 if you go to fiberglass skins, etc.

Ah. I was assuming you'd have to pay to have it done. Doing it youself, it's
just tubes, depreciation on your gear, and whatever your time is worth, natch.

"S" and "A" calipers are what you get on late 911s, the "S" being alloy and the
"A" being cast iron. How much brakes you need depends on how much mass you're
trying to stop from how fast. In general, for the serious high-horsepower
914 applications I've worked on (admittedly, all of which have been fully-
prepared racers), we've needed the biggest brakes we could get. AND needed
vented rotors at all corners. I dunno -- to me, brakes are kinda like helmets,
where you get the quality/capability commensurate with how you value your
life...

>Well, yes, I know that.  Actually, I was looking (and still am) for someone

Sorry, can't help there -- it's all going to depend on what you do to the car
in terms of new weight from the drivetrain, eliminated weight from any cutting
and fitting, etc. No stock answers here. I will say that I'd be really inclined
to get a set of the RSR coil-over struts and adjustable Koni inserts from
Automotion (about $800 a pair) or Carrera coil-overs and Bilstein inserts from
Karftwerke,  and the adjustable height Konis for the rear from Automotion,
because it will make things much easier to re-spring using 2.5" coils than
using torsion bars.

The 914, and even 914/6 are very stable. What's not "stable" in the 
couldda-had-a-V8 plan is that, well, the tub isn't designed for those
loads. It's not unstable in the sense of wanders around the road, it's
unstable in the sense of positive-feedback-loop, where sooner or later,
you're gonna pop something because of unanticipated load and redistributino
of nodal harmonics due to the new configuration. We even see that in
the EP 914s -- you can only do so much with the tub before it gives up.

Well, have you  considered a Beck Sypder? I've got a friend with one, and
it's a blast. Very light, and since you can put anything in it from a
40hp VW Type 1 up through a 3.6 liter Andial-prepped 911 engine, you
should be able to pretty much get your target of 10hp/lb....

They're also VERY unusual, and tend to be big attention getters.

Well, as someone else pointed out, they are 2.0s, in fact pretty much
exactly 2.0T's, except for three pieces which are only found on the 914/6.
(I know what they are to point at, but can't recall the names tonight. If
it's really important to someone, get back with me next week when my

The case didn't significantly change size until the 3.2 Carreras. The 2.0, 2.2
and 2.4 case really *IS* the same size, and nearly the same case -- I think
even machined from the same casting but I really don't remember on that part.
The 2.7 case is very different, but still fairly similar.

>Is a 2.7 911 motor just as easily put in a 914 as a 2.2?

Yup. The GT-2 guys put 2.8's in all the time.

There is mention made of it in "Excellence was Expected", and on a couple of
the other Porsche coffeetable books. And you can see it at the factory museum.
There are a couple of 916s (yeah, the real thing) in the US, but only one
is "on display". Can't remember who owns it, but it's either George Hussey or
someone else down in his neck of the woods.

Well, I finally decided to go get a Lee Press-On Penis Kit (tm).
That way, I can use the shorter "good friends" length during the week, but

Howdy!  I need a oil dipstick for my '71 911T with A/C.  Whatever
is in there now is inadequate -- it's a sort of soldered length
of coil spring that is essentially impossible to read unless the
oil is *really* gooey -- not the case :-).
The issue is that with the A/C compressor in place, the oil filler neck
has an S-bend in it that precludes use of a straight, rigid dipstick
like the one the local dealer sold me (for $35).
So -- anyone out there have a similar car and a solution?  Or is the

I seem to recall that when the 914/6 first came out that the factory
admitted that the engine ran 15-20F hotter than in the 911T. I assume
that an extra oil cooler is a good idea for such a conversion, but
what about cylinder head temperatures, esp. with the higher output
motors people are using now? Is it advisable to go to a less restrictive
engine cover also? How about installing a CHT gauge?

My usual rule of thumb is plan on an extra oil cooler at 185 HP. Or,
if you live in some part of the country where you have to worry about
overheating anyway (like Houston). Or if you're going to race it.

You regulate cylinder head temp mainly by cooling the oil, and to some
extent be regulating heat of combustion,i.e. don't run lean or you'll
regret it. Heat -- the number one killer of young air-cooled engines...

The engine cover is, well, another story. You can't put the rain tray
in with a 911 engine in the bay using the "stock" air cleaner setup.
You *can* put the rain tray in if you use K & N air cleaners, but only
the short version. And that doesn't allow enough free space over the tops
of the air horns for the carbs to work right. Of course, the really hot
setup for air filters is the ITG or similar "foam top" things, which don't
have any real restriction over the tops of the car. This is however a real 
problem if you live in an area where you have to worry about rain.

And you can convert to a "916 style" lid, by replacing the solid part with
more steel mesh. And I seem to recall that a door trim strip from an 
Audi 100LS is exactly right for going between the original and the "new"
mesh sections.

  Dear porschephiles,

  I am replacing the clutch of my 84 944 to get rid of a clanking
noise which appeared when shifting gears.
  After two weeks of spare time wrenching I finally got the clutch
disk out and, as I suspected, the rubber disk was teared apart.
  My question is if it is worth to replace the clutch disk
by one which has a spring center torsion dampener.  It has been advertised by
Auto Mechanika for $189.00.
  If anybody has used such spring disks, let me know how they perform.
  Also, I dont know how difficult is to replace the bearings that support
the power shaft inside the central tube. They seem to be a little noise.
Can someone comment on that also?
  Thanks,
  Antonio

That's because it's not a bolt-on operation. The 912 has a 356 engine,
which has a by-pass oil filter. There's no exposed reliable pressure
line. 

To add an external oil cooler, you have to drill and tap the front
cover (usually doing some welding at the same time), and also drill
and tap the case in one other place. Then you have to block the exit
passage from the oil pump, and can then install both a full-flow oil
filter and an oil cooler in the loop back to the other tapped hole
in the case. This is *MUCH* easier to do on a 912 than a 356 as the
912 has an electric tach and the 356 (except the very last ones) has
a mechanical tach that gets in the way of where you want to drill and tap.

Note you have to take the engine apart to do this.

Best discussion of how to add a full flow filter I've seen lately is
in Duane Stuart's book "The 356 Performance Handbook". But Harry Pellow
has some discussion of that in (I think) "Secrets of the Inner Circle".
Of course, given the commentary from a factory trained master mechanic
who's seen Harry's videos, maybe that should be "Secrets of the Inert Circle"

Stan, VW Beetle hotrodders have been doing something like this to Type
I (Beetle) engines to add full flow filters and auxiliary coolers.
These kits consist of a modified oil pump gearset and modified oil
pump front cover which allows plumbing for external lines. Now my
question is, do you think such a kit can be adapted for use in the
Porsche motor? If so then it might be the solution for this 912
without having to tear down the motor. I have seen these kits adver-
tised in some of the VW hot rod mags like "VW Trends" and "Hot V-Dubs"
Now don't ask me what might happen if you try to run -12 AN oil
lines to the front of the car. I don't have any idea if those tiny
pumps can actually *move* that much oil.

Subject: RE: Porsches w/mazda engs.

Hi there,
I read that there is some interest in rotary to porsche conversions.

A local magazine recently featured and early (68 ish) 911 that had a 13B
turbo engine from an RX7. It was fitted with a carburettor (To solve
injection problems) and was fitted using a VW-rotary kit (I think..) the
reason for this was that the conversion cost less than 1/2 of the cost
of a rebuilt porsche engine. Had approx 200 hp.

I don't know much about 914's at all, but depending on the room around
the engine, a 13B turbo may not fit. In any case, a warmed over 12A
would get anywhere from 170 - 220 hp fairly easily, and would fit
better.

	Judging by the 914 rotary conversion I saw in progress, I would say
that a 13B turbo should be no problem.  The only size difference beteween
the 12A and 13B is each rotor housing is 1 cm longer, all other dimensions
are essentially the same.  There is a big size difference when you add a
turbo (rotaries are small, so a turbo is a significant portion of its
size).  If you were to do a turbo rotary 914 I would suggest some
redesigning of the intake system.  There should be no clearance problems
with the turbo itself (I'm thinking of a second generation RX-7 single turbo
engine, I'm not so sure a sequential twin turbo from the 3rd generation
would fit, but I suspect, again, that the turbos themselves would not be the
problem), the problem would come with the intercooler and intake manifold.
On the single turbo enignes, the intercooler sits on top of the engine and
is fed through a hood scoop.  I suspect this would still fit under the
engine cover on a 914, but it wouldn't get much airflow.  Since 914s suck
their cooling air up from under the car (??? am I way off here, or is that
really how they get their air??  It seems that it would work given the low
pressure area just over the engine...) Putting the intercooler on the left
side (away from the manifolds) should provide plenty of airflow and not
interfere with much.  Of course, this makes for a longer inake sytem that
may introduce some lag.
	some comments on high power rotaries: A warmed over 12A putting out
220hp would be very warmed over.  I have expoerienced a 12A with about
275hp, it lived for about 2000 miles before it ate itslef.  It was a full
peripheral port setup with a 51mm downdraft weber on it.  It had two turbo
mufflers and could still be heard over two miles away, it couldn't be
started with the starter, it had to be push started, and it barely ran below
4000 rpm (but boy did it run above 4000!!!!)  It would have melted the
emissions probe if someone stuck it up its tailpipe, and I guarantee that
with a 914 sized exhaust (ie a lot shourter than in the RX-7) you would have
the tailpipes a nice color of red everytime you went for a spin.  If you are
running a rotary on the street and don't want a turbo, I would suggest not 
doing more than street ports.  Peripheral ports are absolutely undriveable, 
and bridge ports tent to break in about 30 - 40k miles.  (I'd be happy to 
explain what all these port setups are if anyone is interested, but since 
this is the Porsche list, I'll just glaze over it until someone asks me 
more).  Street ports with a 48mm sidedraft is good for about 200hp, which
makes for quite an exciting ride in a 2000 lb car (we had one in a Datsun
510, and it moved quite well!)  There is no way to pass emissions with any
of the engines I have mentioned so far, so if you live in a area where this
matters....  A stock RX-7 Turbo II engine is good for 200hp.  With an
adjustable wastegate and lower restriction intake, 250-260 is easily
attainable, and you still pass emissions.
	OK, I'm ranting and raving now, someone shut me up...  I'd be happy
to talk more about rotaries if anyone is interested, but for now, back to
Porsches...

First thing I thought of myself. Turns out that you can use some of
the parts -- like the extrnal lines, and the thing you screw the oil
filter onto, but the interesting stuff like the oil pump cover and
gears and stuff *ARE NOT THE SAME*.

And for the VW kits you mention, you still have to drill and tap the
case. Good references are the HP Books publications called "How to
Hotrod Your VW Engine" (pre-dating the waterpumpers, natch) and "How
to Rebuild Your Aircooled VW Engine" (which is also a *VERY* good 914
engine rebuild reference -- street grade, of course). You have to
drill and tap the main oil galley for the "return" from the external
filter/cooler, and you have to plug the galley leading off of the pump
to the main galley so that oil will leave out via the pump cover. It's
not just a bolt-on deal.

And, you still have the "need more pressure/volume" problem. On VW's
and 914's you want to use the SCAT or Berg high-volume pump (an extra
8mm of pump gear). On the 356, well, *YOU CAN'T*. Fundamental difference
is that on T-1, -3, and -4 engines, the oil pump is a *unit*,where both
the gears, carrier, and outside wall of the pump slide in and out as a
set. On the 356 (well, OK - the three-piece case OHV versions of the 356
for the picky trivia types out there... 8{) ), the third piece of the
case *IS* the outside part of the pump -- there's no way to use longer
gears without *SERIOUS* machine work!

One of the things I've wondered about is the prospect of replacing the
356 oil cooler with a machined plate to take off oil fittings for
pressure/return to make it easier to fit full flow filters and better
coolers. I haven't gotten around to doing this yet, probably mainly
because I don't race 356s. No motivation other than just plain old
curiosity, and with two race cars partially dis-assembled right now,
and races coming up on April 3-4, it's hard to get motivated to play
with this just to see...

But I don't see any other way to do it right without taking the case apart.

Subject: Sebring update

Well, I know some of you are wondering, so I'll go ahead and let you
know what happened:

The ZZ/ProTechnic Racing team took 4th in GTU and 4th in GTP-Lights.
And had there not been some huge logistical botches, would have taken
at least 3rd in GTU, maybe second. Hard to say.

Ghost Racing hot-shoe Haas Fogle (aside: Haas is the guy who when he was
a lot younger raced a VW Beetle 1300cc in SCCA GT-5. He'd go to junk yards,
buy *core engines*, strip off the heads and piston/cylinders, put on these
race grade pistons, heads, and carbs he had, tighten it up and run it 'til
it blew. He's then "repeat as needed". All the way to a couple of divisional
championships.) drove for the GTU team, which was nominally headed up by
ZZ Top drummer Frank Beard. The rest of the driving team consisted of some
guy who writes for AutoWeek (but who really is an OK driver) and Ernie
someone, a Canadian 914/6 GT-2 driver who turned really impressive times.
The GTP-L car was headed up by Sam Shalala from ProTechnik, a local high-dollar
Porsche only service facility, and co-driven by a team of international
second-tier players -- F3000 and karting champions from a couple of  years
back, that sort of thing.

I asked Haas about what is was like. He said that it was kinda like
driving 150 MPH on the freeway in the worst rain you've ever seen, in
the dark, without lights or lane markers, and getting passed every 30
seconds by something moving *REALLY* fast. He put in nearly 3 hours in
the middle of the night in some of the worst of the rain. And had some
really exciting moments earlier in the race, too, for a total of nearly
5 hours of driving.

If you saw the coverage on ESPN, and remember where the Gunnar 966 went
into the wall and moved the concrete barrier a few feet, well, the 966 missed
the nose of the 911 Haas was driving by about two feet. Haas was having
the same problem -- having just changed back to slicks from rains, and 
then the sky opened up again.

The second semi-exciting part was just before the end of the second ESPN
segment -- the one that ended at 1:00 PM EST. The course was under full 
yellow, and the camera is following the pace car around -- and there
the ZZ/ProTechnik 911 is, 3 cars back from the pace car, for like 10
laps. (white 911, with large bluish/redish triangle on the hood) Turns
out that Fangio was just behind Haas in the Toyota, and right on his ass
the whole way, flashing his brights and everything. Now, since it's a yellow,
he can't pass -- but he could harrass Haas into pulling into the pits so
as to get him out of the way, which is *EXACTLY* what he did.

BTW, the GTU 911 had to run nearly as fast under yellow as it did flat-out
just to keep up with the pace. Something to think about...

Some other trivia: they had started the week with a new motor from CMW,
which chunked after less than 30 minutes of use. Was *NOT* built well,
even though they paid serious money for it. Just an FYI for anyone with
an extra $20k laying about thinking about one of the CMW motors... 8{)

There's more details, but as you can imagine, it's hard to filter out what's
interesting and what's not. So that's it for Sebring coverage... Not
sure what the next ZZ/ProTechnik race will be, but Ghost Racing now turns
it's attention to scenic Abilene, TX, for yet another airport course in 
two weeks.  Sigh...

A few weeks ago, someone posted a query about auto-x rules and safety
considerations.  I mentioned that the "gang of seven," headed by the
infamous Hank Watts ("Secrets of Solo Racing," Loki Publishing) had
proposed a new set of auto-x / time-trial rules and car classes.  I
also offered to try to get an electronic copy if anyone was interested.

Well, I would have a copy RIGHT NOW, except for the weird brownout
in Sunnyvale last night...  Honest, the disk is in the mail.

I've been autocrossing for 2 years in the Golden Gate and Redwood
Regions of Zone 7.  The new rules are a comprehensive look at the 
current cars and how they stack up against each other.  They are
a **big** improvement over the existing rules.

I think that any region setting up a competitive driving program 
would bennefit from looking these over (perhaps adopting them w/o
change).  For another region, there may be a few things that seem
arbitrary.  There was a successful (IMHO) attempt not to move anyone
into a really weird class or put someone who had worked their car
to the edge of the current rules into the next class.

Since the rules should only be about 50 or 60 disk blocks on a VAX,
I am planning to post them to the list unless I get a lot of requests
not too (or one request from Stan...).

     Easy-outs aren't magic.  If the bolt broke due excessive
stress or fatigue, you have a chance.  If the bolt broke because
the threads are siezed, then you may break the easy-out in the
broken bolt, making it virtually impossible to drill out the
whole thing and re-tap it (the easy-out being VERY hard/brittle
material).  You may be better off drilling it first, depending -

     Any tool shop would have them, even Sears.

Easy outs look similar to a tap for threading a hole except that
they have a spiral shaped pattern on them instead of threads.
You start by drilling into the broken bolt. Then attach the easy out
to a handle for a tap, insert it into the hold and turn out the
bolt. Of course, if the broken bolt is really frozen/rusted in,
this might not work without heat.

I'd think you could find them anywhere tools are sold, including
Snap-On, but I haven't bought any in years.

Good Luck!!

	Well, ok, if anyone opjects to Mazda talk, let me know, but for
now....

	OK, if you don't already have a basic idea how a rotary works, I
might not be able to shed much light on it.  They are hard to describe in
words.  How about a convex triangular rotor precessing in an epitrochoidal
housing.  Yea, that would do it.  Ok, now that we have that out of the way,
the intake and exhaust ports have no valves, they are opened and closed by
the rotor sliding over them.  Because of this, port location and size
becomes the rotary equivalent to cam profile and valve size.  The key to
getting horsepower from a rotary is getting as much air as possible in and
out of the engine, there is almost never any messing around with compression
ratios (except going between 9.5:1 and 8.5:1 (I think) for normally
aspirated or turbocharged engines respecively).  There are no aftermarket
rotors with different combustion pockets (same thing as piston dish)
for different compression, so don't even think about trying to mess with
it.  Nearly all horsepower gains come from messing with the intake ports (a
little can be done to open up the exhaust port, but they flow pretty well
already, exhaust work is usually done downstream in the exhaust system, and
is also *very* beneficial).  The basic ideas of port work are as follows:
	Most rotaries have two intake ports per rotor, one in each side
housing.  They are opened and closed by the side of the rotor sliding over
them.  The closer the ports are to the periphery (the rotor housing), the
longer they will stay open.  Also, if they extend farther towards the top of
the engine, they will close later (good for high rpm power when the intake
air has some inertia).  Of course, port size has the obvious effect, except
that the directions in which the size is increased effect the timing.  Ok,
so those are the basic principles of intake ports, now what's available (you
probably already guessed you don't just want to go after the ports with a
dremel tool and a prayer).
	The 6 port 13B:
		This engine, which is the one found in all normally
aspirated 13B powered RX-7s (second generation cars and first generation
GSL-SE) had one intake port on one side of the rotor and two on the other.
The "auxiliary power port" as the Mazda guys call it was a small port
located above the normal port, so it essentially added some (lots of)
duration.  The port was shut off by means of a butterfly valve except at
high rpm and high loads (the valve was opened based on exhaust pressure).
Under these conditions, the extra duration could be used without hurting
drivability.  This is essentially variable valve timing, but far simpler and
cheaper!
	<so if all 13B powered RX-7s had 6port engines, how do I claim that
most rotaries have four port engines?  Well, ok, most of the standard
modifications are done to the four port engines, because they have been
around longer.  The four port 13B was found in the RX-4 and the Cosmo
(RX-5), and probably some random Japanese models too.>
	Street ports:
		Street ports are essentially someone who knows what they are
doing going after the stock four port engine with a dremel tool (I suggest
Racing Beat, they really know what they are doing).  The intake ports are
enlarged, mostly up and out (towards the perephery) and are smoothed out a
lot.  There is usually a little exhaust port work to go along with it.  With
street ports and an appropriate intake system (48mm DeLorto or Holley 4
barrel) and a header and a free exhaust system, this will give you an engine
that puts out about 200hp, still idles under 1000rpm, and will pull all the
way from idle to wherever you decide to shift (if you shift at or below
8000rpm, the apex seals will last far longer)
	Bridge ports:
		Bridge ports start with street ports, then another long
skinny port about the same height as the street port is cut out of the corner 
of chamber where the side chamber and rotor housing meet.  (a port on the 
periphery is always open!  Only the apex seal slides over these ports, so are 
always open to at least one chamber).  Since the corner seals (and all the
seals for that matter) are spring loaded to keep pressure agaist the rotor
and side housings, blending these two ports into one lartge port would
result in the disasterous sproinging out of the corner seal (yea, the
official Mazda term is sproing..., that's the ticket!).  To avoid this, there
is a "bridge" left between the two ports, hence the name.  The problem with
bridge ports, besides their poor steetability (depending, of course, on your
tolerance for rough low rpm running), is that the bridges tend to crack
after a while.  Because of this, bridge ports are usually reserved for pure
race engines.
	Peripheral Ports:
		Peripheral ports are what they sound like.  They are cut
into the rotor housing instead of the side housings.  The side ports are
welded up, and either a factory Mazda Comp rotor housing, or a Racing Beat
housing (or whoever may make such a housing) must be used.  Since peripheral
ports are open all the time, and are usually HUGE, they aren't happy at all
at low rpm.  They often aren't even happy at high rpm, but if they are good,
they are very very good!  The 275hp 12A I rode in was a peripheral port
setup using the Racing Beat housings.  Peripheral ports have been outlawed
in most racing classes, and nobody seems to complain much.  You can get
amazing amounts of power at high rpm with peripheral ports (think about the
inertia of the intake charge if the ports NEVER close!), but like I
mentioned before, they are very obnoxious engines.

	Some of my info is a few years out of date.  I'm sure there has been
some development in the modifying of 6 port engines since the most recent
stuff I have seen.  Last I heard Racing Beat was very excited about the
prospects of turbocharging a 6 port engine, but hadn't done it yet.  There
has been very little success by anyone to make a good aftermarket turbo for
a rotary, so if you are going to go that route, you should probably stick 
with a mostly stock engine.
	Good intake and exhaust systems are also a must for good power, and
if you plan to spin high rpm (if you are building a rotary, you plan to
spin!), get a breakerless distributor.  The street ported rotary I spend a
summer wrenching on was constantly having ignition problems because of the
points (sometimes with spectacular results, we almost caught the tailight on
fire once when the engine just started belching flames out the exhaust pipe
for about a second!)

 	I hope some of this was clear, I can't tell.  If there is anything I
can clear up (or anything I am wrong about) let me know...

An easy-out is a left-hand threaded tapered screw. You drill into the bolt,
screw the easy-out into the hole, and then you apply sufficient torque
to it that it snaps off flush, leaving you a stuck bolt with some very hard
steel embedded. They only ever work if the bolt really isn't stuck, but if
that's the case, it shouldn't have snapped off.

	   It has been a bad week.  In the last few days I have set a new
   personal record for breaking bolts.  I have heard that Easy-Outs make
   it possible to get broken bolts out fairly easily.  How do they work?
   Also, where can I get them?  I looked in the Snap-On catalog and
   didn't see any.  My application is the rear hinge bolts on the 914
   (and a couple of broken bleader valves on the brakes.)

Easy-Outs (or stud extractors) come in at least two forms. I have used
the type that looks like a corkscrew and the type that has a rect-
tangular profile, preferring the later. Mine were made by PROTO, but
many companies make them (Snap-On doesn't? eh?). 

In order to get them to work you have to drill out the center of the
offending stud first. Let's say you're trying to remove an 8mm stud.
You would look on the package that came with the Easy-Out and it would
tell you to use a 3/16" drill for that size stud. So you would drill
out the stud right through the center with the 3/16" bit and then
insert the Easy-Out until it wedged into the stud. Then you'd apply
reverse torque (anti-clockwise) to the Easy-Out and the stud would
turn out easily. That's the ideal situation.

In reality, the Easy-Out is not a godsend. They do work well most of
the time but it takes *careful* drilling with progressively larger
bits and alot of patience. But if that sucker breaks off in the stud
then you'll really go crazy because you can't drill through it, its
probably harder than the drill bit. You have to try to chisel it out
and it gets very ugly very quickly. You'll want to trade the car for
a bicycle and pedal to the funny farm...

Subject: RE: How do easy-outs work?

an easy out  (generically called a bolt extractor) is a small piece of 
tool steel,
somewhat tapered, with a set of very coarse, left-handed threads cut into it.
to use it, a hole is drilled into the offending (offensive? :-} ) bolt, 
and the extractor is tapped into the hole, while being threaded into 
the hole. this will usually turn the stuck bolt out of the hole. 
depending on the situation, the hard part can either be drilling the 
hole, or getting the stub unstuck. good luck!

As a few have mentioned, it the bolt is **really** in there good,

Yes, you cannot drill them.

So, if you think this is the case, soak the broken bolt in liquid 
wrench  for a week or so first, then use the easy out.

This is absolutely true.  I broke one, a Sears I think, trying to get
a frozen carburetor jet out a few years ago.  Not happy, no, not at all. 
Ended up getting the smallest drill bit I owned, and arduously drilled
teeny holes all around the jet's crown to get everything out.

Never used the damn thing again, until last summer.  The jam nut (for
wont of the correct term) which holds the easy-out bit in the t-handle
turned out to be just the right size to replace a vanished 7 mm jam
nut on a friend's 911 clutch cable, at the track.  I think the new owner
of the car may still be driving around with a piece of my easy-out.

In fact, the drive tube bearings are not replaceable.  If one is gone,

     The padded dash unit sits on top of some conformal sheet

studs which fit through holes in the sheetmetal, secured by nuts,
and also a handful of plastic clips which poke through holes in
the sheetmetal and snap into place.  The latter are a pain to
remove.  Access to the nuts and the clips is from the trunk for
some, and by removing a dash instrument or two for others.  Be
careful in your selection of a shop, as clearance is limited, and
groping around behind the dash without care can damage wireing,
etc.  Point out that everything works, and you expect the same

Just out of curiousity, how much were you quoted for the restoration of your

To remove the dash, you'll probably have to remove the instruments, radio, and
glove box to get to some of the bolts (I've done it on a 914).  Also, you may
have to come in from the front trunk to get to some of the forward ones.  I've
always heard that you have to remove the windshield to get the dash out - don't

My rear defroster doesn't work either - the lines on the window have corroded

The padded dash has several molded in bolts. There are 2? above 
the instrument cluster and 3? from the front edge of the dash, with
one at the extreme left and one at the extreme right.

The edge nearest the windshield is usually held on by sheet metal screws
from above.

Also there are a number of clips similar to the ones that hold the
door panels on.  You will need to pull out your fresh air fan and
maybe the windshield wiper assembly to get to all the fasteners.
If you pull the windshield wiper, be sure and mark where all the
wires go before you remove it.

Usually, the front windshield has to be removed to do the job.

My guess is the rear window defroster doesn't work because the
elements are shot.  You can verify that voltage is getting to the
elements by probing at the feed points under the rear window gasket.
See if you are getting 12-14 volts.  The car must be running and the
alternator working to make the measurement because the defroster voltage
feed is diode isolated from the battery.

If the voltage is there, turn off the defroster switch and 
measure the resistance of the elements with a voltmeter with the defroster
switch off.  

If I remember correctly, the elements are split up into three sections,
a middle, and top and bottom.  If the middle section is rated for
100 watts, expect resistance of about (V^2)/100 = 144/100= 1.44 ohms.

Subject: Re: 911 padded dash removal

My 1966 911 dash is (partially?) attached with screws that are located
on the lower ends. This dash is made of vinyl sheet over padding. Don't
know if that is that same construction as the 1970 dashes.

While we're on the subject, during warm weather a fog accumulates on
the inside of the windshield. I think this comes from outgassing by the
vinyl. Can someone suggest a way to stop that, or does the vinyl have
to be replaced with newer stuff that doesn't outgas? Since the "grill"
for the speaker is a cluster of holes in the vinyl and padding, I don't
expect my local upholstery shop that has replacement vinyl for seats,
etc., to be able to replace that section of the dash top. Any
ideas/experiences here?

Subject: 944-S Rough Idle

Help.....

I have a 1987 944-S.  Lately it has been acting funny.  When I come to a
stop light, it idles rough.  The Tachometer sometimes drops down to just
a couple of hundred RPM before it bounces back up to 800 RPM.  This rough
idle problem is --NOT-- a case of bad motor mounts.  It is a problem with
the motor.  Also, when driving down the highway, If I take my foot of the
gas and coast for 10 or 15 seconds it hesitates and coughs when I give it 
gas again.  I know the plugs are clean.  A buddy of mine thought that 
maybe the fuel mixture was screwed up.  He was unable to adjust it.
Would the car still run if the Air Flow Meter was dead?  

I saw the messages about the DME test connector and how to get 
information out of it with a LED.   I was hoping the DME knows 
what is wrong.   I looked for it on my car and could not find it.  
I see a test connector on the schematics, but the schematics indicate 
a much larger connector.  Does anybody know if my car has the test 
connector that outputs information to a LED and where EXACTLY it might be?  

If I need a new Air Flow Meter, is there a good place anybody can 
recommend to get a used one?  How much $$ am I looking at?  
Any input you have is appreciated!

David -

It is very unlikely that your air flow meter has suddenly and unexpectedly
died.  More likely, you have crud in your idle stabilizer.  Alas, getting
to it on the 944S is the pits, worse than any other model 944 or 968
because of the size of the "bunch of bananas."  I recommend removing it
and cleaning it out with carb cleaner, as a first step.  If that doesn't
solve the problem, you can start to look for other causes.

Re:  Padded dash removal
For my '66 912, you have to remove the windshield, and I suspect with
later models this is still true.  You dont have to remove any instruments
to get it out.  There's just a few nuts/clips and its a easy operation.
I dont think there's any way to get the dash out without taking your
windshield out (back of dash flips up and would not pass the windshield).

In Hemming's there a numerous adds to have your dash recovered,
several have experience with P-cars.  I got estimates around $250 and
plan on having one of them do the work within the next few weeks.
You just ship it to 'em, they call you with an estimate and then do the work
and ship it back.  Most say it takes a couple of weeks.

Loosen the lock nut, and spin the lock pin up/down as needed.  If it's 
too tight, the hatch may nut latch securely and might actually squeak 
more.  Too loose won't seal well, but it'll generally be safe.

NO, don't loosen the star allen's.

Flush dirt from the latches by spraying WD-40 (or similar oil-based 
juice) into the latch.  Then, lubricate the pins and latches with 
grease.  Don't put too much on the pins - you'll get it on your 
clothes, etc. when you use the hatch.

I had a similar problem with my 944. By loosening the jam nut
on the male part of the latch and screwing in on it you can
tighten the hatch on that side. I had some trouble adjusting
the hatch and still getting it to open by itself when pushing
the release button, though.

I had a friend that just went through this with a 924 they had on lease

would turn the car in at the expiration date, did they want to dicker?
The answer was no. 10 days before the turn in date the dealer who
was handling the lease called and was very anxious to arrive at a
buyout price that was much fairer. She had already bought another
car but she offered the guy a very low price which he said 
he would take. She said "Nah - I bought another car"

Subject: Re: 944 hatch adjustment

I would do everything as Jim Selders suggests.  You can also check the
star allen bolts for tightness.  I think they take a 6 mm bit, which is
smaller than the 8 mm most folks have for doing CV joints.

Lube the hinges at the top of the hatch; something like Wurth HHS 2000
is great because it penetrates then dries.  Check all the Philips head
screws retaining the air dam.  Finally, check the rear wiper motor
assembly.  The two grommets which hold it to the window frame tend to
decay.  Make sure the rubber seals around the armature are in position.

(I found the factory had thrown an extra fender washer on the inside of
the armature where it goes through the window.  I removed it.)

One source of squeaking is apparently the fit of the window in the frame.
A friend tried fixing his by shimming thin cardboard between the trim
and the window glass.  Temporary fix, since it ended up just pushing
the frame further from the glass.

When in doubt, lube.

Well, I went and did the clutch master and slave on the 924S last
Saturday.  I wasn't going to, but the shop estimates exceeded my
threshold of pain, and GPR had the parts for $96 (yes, they're
the same as on the 931).  Even with UPS Red, they had the best
price by far (Strano's was next, others about 50% higher).
Matched the originals exactly (except for the date code ;-).

Changing them was somewhat of a hassle, mostly because I worked
on them in my driveway in 40-45 degree weather.  I made a lot
of dumb mistakes, like nicking the spoiler when trying to get
the front wheels on ramps, and connecting the hoses to the master
before the slave was in place, such that the reservior emptied 
out onto the driveway.  The most difficult part of the job was
loosening the starter bolts; I finally got the right combination
of ratchet and extender to crack them.  BTW, is there a torque
specification for these bolts, or the fasteners for the master
and slave cylinders?  I didn't see any in the manual.  The next
hardest part was removing/replacing the nuts that fasten the 
master - it's pretty tight in there, so progress was slow.

The entire job took me about six hours, not including the bleed
that I still need to do.  It turned out to be relatively 
straightforward, although next time (should there be one) will
be much easier, now that I've gone through it.  Total parts
cost was about $140.  I'll use the money I saved to buy a

as cracking the pan a bit.  Luckily, I still have plenty of parts

I've got the pan from my old engine, I've got the steering mechanism-
where should I get the cross brace (it's a '77 924)?  The only

Hi,

     I'm in the San Diego region.  I can contact Ernie for you on
on inclusion as a special interest group.  I don't know him
personally, but I've seen him at events.  It shouldn't be a
problem.

     I'll check the March Pano to see what you're talking about.

Subject:      FAQ warning - Buying advice wanted

Yes - it's true,

    I'm finally thinking about actually buying a Porsche.  What I'm
looking for may not exist but I figure I'll call on the collective wisdom
of the net to help me direct my focus.  Here's what I'm interested in:

    Late 80's  ('86-'89) 944 series or
    around '80 ('78-'83) 911

    Is reliable!  I.e.
    Something that could be driven daily (i.e. will take city traffic
    abuse) but can provide adrenalin pumping excitement on the open road or
    the track

    Doesn't cost an arm and a leg (both purchase price and maintenance)

    For racing purposes, I am particularly interested in models that are
    competitive in SCCA SOLO II autocross

Depending on what I come up with, the Vette may have to go to make room in
the garage.  (P.S.  don't tell the Vette guys)

If you have any specific recommendations, warnings, etc. - prices -
availability - experiences - insurance - high mileage cars - whatever . . .

E-mail directly to me please!!!  Results available on request.

THANKS a bunch in advance - T.H.

Anybody had good experience with or just want to recommend a good paint
shop in the Boston area?  I plan on de-dinging / repainting my 911 this
spring.  Also, this wonderful (I really do love snow) winter has resulted
in one mother of a rock bulls eye in the middle of my windshield.  Any
body care to recommend a good glass shop in the area?

Thanks!

As you know, the market is dead on these cars.  I'd only recommend that 
you don't go any "deeper" with your money here - the car is wonderful, 
but a financial disaster.

If you want to keep the car, turn it in and buy another (maybe your 
own, once they try to sell it) in the used market.  This will save you 
$10+K I'd estimate.  Good luck!

Subject: Easy outs one more time



I don't want to beat a dead horse but I found out something that might
help the guy who asked about easy outs.  I recently found out that there
is a left hand drill bit.  Instead of using the standard drill bit to 
drill a hole in the broken stud or bolt use a drill bit that spins
counterclockwise.  You'll need a reversible drill obviously and by drilling
in the opposite direction the vibrations sometimes will loosen the broken
stud and make the easy out unnecessary.  If you still need to use the
easy out at least drilling counterclockwise will not have made the
situation worse.  I have no idea where to get these drill bits but
a large mill and machine would probably have them.

If I recall from the manual correctly, the liners are either
supposed to be glued or double-sided taped to the pads.  I
would be afraid that it might work loose and hit the wheel and
then do who knows what.  I don't have an "S" and have never even
changed the pads in my 944T so I could be totally wrong.

From: Rod.Miller@Eng.Sun.COM (Rod Miller)
Subject: RE: lease termination

Your options depend on the type of lease you have. First, a simplistic
and hopefully still accurate primer on lease types:

1. A car lease is like buying something on time - you start out with a
principal amount that is owed (in leasing it is called the capitalized
cost, but I won't use that term here.) Part of your monthly payments go
towards interest and part towards principal. However, at the end of a
lease, there is a non-zero principal amount remaining.

2. With a _closed end_ lease, the leasing company/dealer takes the risk
that at lease termination, the lease principal amount will be greater
than the car's market value.  Closed end leases are good for the lessor
(you) if the car is worth less than the principal amount - you walk
away and let the leasing company/dealer take the bath.

3. With an _open end_ lease, you, the lessor, take the risk that that
at lease terminatinon, the lease principal amount will be greater than
the car's market value.  These are good if the car is worth more than
the principal amount - you can buy the car for the principal amount and
resell it at a profit if you want. If the car's value is less than the
market value, you take the bath.

If you have a closed end lease and you want the car, negotiate with the
leasing company/dealer. They are stuck, and a sale to you at a loss
would be much simpler than taking the car back and either reselling it
or sitting on it until it sells, both at a guaranteed loss. I read
recently (on this list? - red face if so!) of a situation where the
stuckee dealer approached the lessor about a reduced buyout price (but
too late as the lessor had already committed to another vehicle.)

Good luck!

From: LAFORCE@XENON.ARC.NASA.GOV
Subject: GGR autox/TT rules

Note to everyone on the Porschephiles mailing list:

Here are the new auto-x time-trial rules that Golden Gate 
Region (and, most likely, the rest of Zone 7) will be using
in 1994.

I hope they are of use to someone.

- --Soren            laforce@xenon.arc.nasa.gov

By the way, much as I'd like to, I can't take any credit for
the proposal.  The "gang of seven" is listed below.

***************************************************************


                PORSCHE

GGR AUTOCROSS AND TIME TRIAL RULES, 1994

                Revised 2Mar93
Zone 7 Drivers:

You are now holding Evolution '94, the rules by
which GGR will run our Time Trials and
Autocrosses, beginning next year.  These rules have
evolved over the last year.  A team of seven, Henry
Watts, Gary Dorighi, Bud Behrens, Dave Blanchard,
Tom Poole, Ken Mack and myself worked for over
six months to put the basic proposal together.  We
then asked for input from the racing membership at
Time Trials and Autocrosses.  We received a fantastic
amount of input, and these rules reflect the breadth
and depth of knowledge of the members of the club. 
I would like to thank the team of seven as well as all
of you who took the time to study the proposal and
then write or called us with your suggestions.  I
believe we have an incredibly solid foundation to
take us into the racing future.

The Evolution '94 team and the 1993 Driver's Events
Committee met on February 23 to put the final
touches on the rules proposal.  Evolution '94 will be
used as the 1994 rules after going through the usual
change process this year.  The schedule for that
process is:

          June 15: Deadline to send my your rules change
                proposals

          August Nugget: Change proposals printed

          August 17: Open meeting for comments on the
                proposed changes (tentative)

          August 31: Rules finalized by the Driver's Events
                Committee

          October Nugget: Approved revisions printed
          October 1: New rule books printed



/s/  Kirk Doberenz, 1993 Competition Director



Section 2.8(j) is added to the current rulebook, section 3.2(e) is
deleted, section 3.2T is replaced with the section 3.2T below, all of
section 4 is replaced, Appendix B is renamed to Appendix F.  All other
sections of the current rules are unaffected.


2.8 PROTESTS AND APPEALS
      (j): Camber Protests:  Protests involving allowable camber that result
           in the protestee being found to be in violation of camber limits
           by less than .25x shall be held in abeyance until the next event,
           at which time the car will be reinspected.  If the car is found to
           be in complete compliance at this second event, the original
           protest will be dropped.  If the car is not in complete compliance
           at the second event, the original protest will be upheld for that
           first event, and the car will be disqualified for both events.

           If, at the second event, the car is entered in a category that
           permits the camber settings measured at the first event, the car
           will, of course, be allowed to run in the second event, but will be
           disqualified for the event at which the protest was lodged.


3.2 SAFETY - AUTOMOBILES
      (e) [delete this section in the current rules]

3.2T  Time Trials
      (a) Roll Bars:  Roll bars (or cages) are recommended in all cars.

           Roll bars are required in all open cars.  914s and Targas are not
           open cars.

           Roll bars or cages are required non-open cars except in Stock and
           Improved Categories and except for student or provisional drivers
           in Production Category.

           Approved roll bars are defined in Appendix D.

      (b) Roll Cages:  Full roll cages are permitted, but must conform to
           the roll cage definition in Appendix D.

      (c) Fire Extinguishers:  Fire extinguishers are required for all cars and
           must be easily accessible to the driver in his seated position. 
           Minimum requirement is a 5 BC rating with a gauge.

      (d) Windows:  Passenger and driver's side windows must be down
           at all times.

      (e) Tire Rating:  All tires must have an HR or higher rating.



4.0 AUTOMOBILES
      (a) Purpose:  These rules are structured to inform participants what
           modifications are allowed.   This section defines the eligibility
           requirements, the allowable modifications and the car
           classifications for the different categories of automobiles listed
           below.  Refer to the specific section for definition of that
           category.  Also see Appendicies A, B and C.

      (b) The Categories & Reasons for them: 

                 Stock Category (compete in a daily driver)                4.1
                 Improved Category (low-cost, reversible changes)          4.2
                 Production Category (maximum performance without          
                        major engine/transmission work)                    4.3
                 Super-Production Category (Production + one step)         4.4

                 Prodified Category (budget racing for 914s)               4.5
                 Street Modified Category (fun w/ minimal restrictions)    4.6
                 Modified Category (maximum performance)                   4.7
                 Exhibition Category (avoid classes altogether)            4.8


      (c) The Classes:  See Appendicies A and B for the Classes for all cars.

           Additionally, Special classes, to be designated S1, S2, etc., can
           be created by any three or more competitors who decide to run
           against each other.  The competitors must petition the
           chairperson of the series (autocross or time trial) before the end
           of the first event of the season.  Year-end trophies shall be
           awarded only if at least three competitors participate in enough
           events to earn an award.

      (d) Specificity:  The rules only define what is permitted.  If the
           modification is not specifically allowed by the rules, it is not
           permitted. 

      (e) Update/Backdate:  Any car may be entered as a different car
           than originally manufactured, provided it matches the car as
           which it is being run in all performance-related specifics.  These
           include (but are not limited to) weight, weight distribution
           (front/rear and side-to-side), center-of-gravity height, gearing,
           power, torque, suspension, and airflow.

           In addition to normal update/backdate, this provides a potential
           path for limited edition cars and European-specification cars to
           compete in some categories, provided they can be legitimately
           configured.

      (f) U.S. Delivered Cars:  Within the Stock, Improved, Production and
           Super-Production Categories, cars are defined as U.S. model
           specification Porsches that were normally delivered to the U.S.
           public for general road use through the manufacturer's
           authorized sales outlet.

           Unless otherwise specified, European cars and parts are not
           considered stock.  Owners of European-specification cars may run
           these cars in any class that would allow, as legal modifications,
           all of the relevant differences between the U.S model and the
           European model of that car.  For example, if the only differences
           between the European and U.S models were in the chip and in a
           compression ratio difference of less than .5 points, that car could
           run in the production class.  Cars with larger motors than were
           delivered in the U.S. would certainly have to move to at least the
           Super-Production Category.

      (g) Limited-Edition Cars:  Special Porsches, produced in quantities of
           less than 400, are not considered identical to the model on which
           they are based.  

           If not covered in the list below, such cars must be modified to
           fully conform to the specifications of a class, or they may run in
           the Super Street Category, (provided they came from the factory
           with a proper interior - if not they run in the Modified Category).

           The 924S SE may not compete in the Stock or Improved
                 Categories, due to the 951 front struts.
           The '75 911 Carrera and the 911 Weissach (SC) may not time trial
                 in the Stock or Improved Categories (due to the rear wing)
                 unless they elect to run against the stock or improved 911 3.2
                 Carrera, which they may do, or they remove the wing and
                 substitute a standard engine cover.
           The RS America runs as a C2.  The car is only slightly lighter than
                 the C2, even if the airconditioning option is not selected; 
                 most cars coming to America have air conditioning.  Further,
                 the suspension modifications are all available as a sport
                 suspension package on the C2
           Other models may be restricted as needed by the Drivers Events
           Committee.

      (h) Similar Equipment in a Class:  Unless specifically prohibited, cars
           may run with the same performance-related equipment (wheels,
           brakes, wings, etc.) allowed any competitor in the same class. 
           This does not override the tire/wheel specifications in Appendix
           A.

      (i) Noise:  Site Restrictions may require effective noise mufflers. 
           Students are required to run effective mufflers to allow
           instruction.

      (j) Fuel:  Any gasoline fuel is permitted.  Additives (non-oxygen
           bearing) may be used as long as they do not constitute more
           than 10% of the fuel.

      (k) Aerodynamic Devices:  Devices which articulate or adjust when
           the car is in motion are prohibited, except for the normal devices
           on the C2s and C4s.

      (l) 14" Wheels:  Some models of Porsches (911E, late 912, 924,
           etc.) were originally equipped with 14" wheels.  Owners of such
           cars may legitimately argue that these cars should be permitted
           to run such wheels.  However, unless some other adjustment is
           made, such cars may have a substantial overall gearing
           advantage, especially during autocrossing.  Therefore, any car
           that was originally equipped with 14" wheels may run such
           wheels, but must, if competing in Stock, Improved or Production
           Categories, run tires that are one step larger in aspect ratio (60
           series instead of 50 series, for example) than what is permitted in
           Appendix A.



4.1 STOCK CATEGORY 
      (a) Purpose:  The purpose of the Stock Category is to provide for
           cars which are driven on a daily basis, on normal street tires, and
           owned by people who do not wish to modify their car, buy extra
           sets of wheels, or spend time changing tires.  For many
           competitors this will be a logical starting category.

           Most of the modifications allowed in the Stock Category are not
           performance-enhancing changes.  Other modifications are
           allowed because some normal, stock cars were delivered that
           way, and it makes no sense to either prevent such cars from
           running or to allow such drivers to have an unfair competitive
           advantage over cars that did not have such features.  Some
           permitted modifications support the proper rebuild of older
           engines. 

      (b) Non-Performance Modifications:  Any modification that is clearly
           not related to performance is permitted.  Such modifications must
           have no significant enhancing effect on weight, weight
           distribution (front/rear and side-to-side), center-of-gravity height,
           gearing, power, torque, suspension, or airflow.

      (c) Adjustments:  Except as noted, any modification for the sole
           purpose of facilitating adjustment of the car or the motor (such
           as modified valve adjusters) are permitted.  Adjustable spring
           plates are not covered by this provision (and therefore not
           allowed in the Stock Category) as they introduce plastic bushing
           material.  914 adjustable rear spring perches are permitted, as
           long as the original spring is used.

      (d) Cooling:  Any oil-, water-, or air-cooling change which allows the
           engine to run cooler is permitted, unless otherwise prohibited. 
           The 914 plastic engine cover water tray may be removed.  Such
           changes tend to extend engine life and should be encouraged.

      (e) Seats:  Aftermarket seats may be substituted for the stock seats. 
           Such seats must have an adjustment for seatback angle, except in
           914s.  This allows the replacement of worn seats without
           excessive lightening of the car.

      (f) Fuel Pump:  Any fuel pump may be used.  Fuel pumps should
           not be a problem.  If, in a specific case, the fuel pump is a
           limiting factor, the driver should be allowed to correct the
           problem.

      (g) Balancing:  The motor may be balanced.  Note that this is not
           necessarily a recommended procedure.  Most Porsche engines are
           built so precisely that they will not achieve any noticeable
           performance increase through balancing.

      (h) Lubrication System:   Modifications to the lubrication system
           designed to provide a constant source of engine lubrication are
           permitted, including oil traps, extended sumps and push rod
           tubes, baffling and pressurized systems.  Such changes tend to
           extend engine life and should be encouraged.

      (i) Motor Re-builds:  To allow for normal rebuilds, the motor may
           be overbored to a maximum of .5mm.  Note: to remain in the
           Stock or Improved Category, any motor which is rebuilt must
           retain the stock compression ratio.  If any procedures (such as
           truing the heads) change the compression ratio, cylinder spacers
           or other parts and/or techniques must be used to bring the motor
           back to stock compression ratio.

      (j) Chain Tensioner:  Any chain tensioner or chain guard is
           permitted.

      (k) Popoff Valve:  A spring-loaded popoff valve may be used with
           any 911 CIS fuel injection system.  This does not change the
           performance of the engine, but may prevent major problems.

      (l) Mufflers & Heat Exchangers:  Any muffler which is functionally
           equivalent to the stock muffler may be used.  This allows owner
           to replace wornout mufflers with reasonable-cost options, but
           does not allow performance-enhancing mufflers in the stock
           category.

      (m) Short-Shift Kits:  Any short-shift kit may be used.  Short-shift
           kits are a valid factory option, though not common on the early
           cars.  Further, the short-shift kit is not necessarily a performance-
           enhancing option.

      (n) Limited-Slip Differentials:  Cars other than 356s, 914s, 914-6s,
           924s and 912s and pre-1978 911s may use any limited slip
           differential.  This is to take into account that such differentials
           are somewhat common on the other cars.  However, limited-slip
           differentials are not common on the cars listed, and allowing
           them in the stock class would create an undue hardship on the
           majority of the drivers of these cars, who might feel that they
           would have to install such a device to be competitive.  The cars in
           this list may install limited slip differentials in the Production
           Category

      (o) Fenders:  Fenders may be rolled.  Flared fenders are permissible,
           but do not change the allowable wheel/tire sizes or the maximum
           offsets permitted.  This allows competitors to drive with larger
           tires/wheels on the street, if they desire.  As long as valid
           tire/wheel combinations are specified for competition, there is no
           competitive advantage to flares or rolling.

      (p) Interior Options:  Any steering wheel may be used, as long as a
           factory airbag device is not removed when the wheel is changed. 
           Floormats and trunk mats may be removed.  Seatbacks in the
           rear passenger compartment may be removed.  The seatbacks
           are useless if a rollbar is installed, and many people prefer to
           have them out anyway.

      (q) Shocks:  Any steel-bodied, singly adjustable (damping or
           rebound, but not both) shock absorber may be used.  The shock
           must be mounted right-side-up.  Thus, people may replace worn
           with any reasonable street shock.

      (r) 914 Chassis Stiffening:  914s are permitted a factory-type rear
           chassis stiffening set.  Alternate bracing for the 914 'inner'
           suspension mount may be used.  Such alternate bracing shall not
           be attached to the roll bar or the roll cage attachement points. 
           Bolted flanges may be used to hold a tubing (1" square) 'X
           brace' to the body.  This is to allow the motor to be removed. 
           Such bracing shall fall within the limits indicated by the sketch
           given in Appendix D, 914 Bracing.  Such stiffening is allowed in
           the Stock Category to solve problems with worn/deteriorated
           chassis.  Such stiffening should not be of noticeable help to 914s
           that are in good condition and are restricted to stock suspension
           and hard-compound street tires.

      (s) Alignment Settings:  Any setting may be used, except for
           camber.  Camber is the single most important suspension setting
           for competition.  Camber settings are limited to 1x at the front
           of rear- or mid-engined cars, 1.5x at the rear of rear- or mid-
           engined cars, 1.5x at the front of front-engined cars and 1x at
           the rear of front-engined cars.  Camber measurements shall be
           the average of the readings from both sides of the car, with the
           driver seated in the driver seat.  This is to compensate for the
           lack of a known perfectly level surface when measuring camber in
           the field.  Keeping camber setting reasonable allows the car to
           be driven on the street without excessive tire wear on the inside
           edge.  

      (t) 911E Air Suspension:  911E-style air suspension may be replaced
           with the standard 911 torsion bar suspension.  This change is
           recommended.

      (u) Spare Tire:  The spare tire may be removed.

      (v) Tire Types:  Tire must show a wear rating of at least 120. 
           Sticky-compound or R-compound competition tires are not
           permitted.  The Drivers Events Committee may designate any tire
           as a sticky-compound competition tire.  Recapped tires are not
           permitted.  The wear-rating limitation helps restrict the Stock
           Category to cars that are normally driven on the street by people
           who do not want to spend time or money on extra wheels or
           changing tires.

      (w) Tire Wear:  All tires must have a DOT approved tread pattern. 
           At anytime during the event, tires must have at least 1/32" tread
           remaining in any two adjacent grooves at any location on the
           tire.  The measurement of tread depth shall not be made where
           tie bars, bumps or fillets are located.

      (x) Tire & Wheel Sizes:  Appendix A shows the allowable sizes for
           tires and wheels.  In the Stock Category, the allowable size is the
           base number.  The '+' number indicates the amount of increase
           available in other categories.

      (y) Brake Pads, Lines, Dustcovers:  Any brake pad may be used. 
           Any brake line with performance at least equal to original
           equipment may be used.  Dust covers may be removed.  The
           17mm and 19mm master cylinders may be used interchangeably. 
           Brake pads should be whatever the owner wants.  Upgrading the
           brake lines should be permitted in the interests of safety.

      (z) Air-conditioning:  Air-conditioning may be removed.  This is a
           valid delete-option on most models of Porsches.

      (aa) Removable Tops:  Removable tops may be removed; sunroofs
           may be open.  No reason to run in a closed car on a nice day.

      (bb) 356 Air Cleaners:  356s may upgrade the old, wire-mesh
           aircleaners to any aircleaner element.

      (cc) Mirrors:  Any interior and/or exterior mirrors may be used.

      (dd) Cam Timing:  Any cam timing may be used.



4.2 IMPROVED CATEGORY
      (a) Purpose:  The Improved Category provides competition
           opportunity for people who prefer to run on the stickier tires
           available, and who wish to make only relatively inexpensive and
           reversible changes to their Porsches.

           Most of the modifications permitted in the Improved Category
           (but not permitted in the Stock Category) are relatively
           inexpensive and reversable.  They tend not to interfere in the use
           of the car as a daily driver, as long as the owner doesn't mind
           the car being a bit taut.  Such changes are not permitted in Stock
           because they tend to violate the notion that a normal daily driver
           can be driven to the track and run as is.

      (b) All of the modifications permitted in the Stock Category are
           permitted.

      (c) Sway Bars:  Alternate sway bars may be used, including
           adjustable sway bars, except that, in keeping with the objective
           of reversibility, no part of the original car may be cut (914s may
           cut the sheet metal necessary, as this is done for all 914 sway-bar
           installations).  This effectively means that late models 911s
           running in the Improved Category may not switch to adjustable
           front sway bars.

      (d) Track Increase:  Through the use of wheel spacers or wheels with
           non-standard offsets, the track width of the car may be increased
           over stock by .25" per side, front and rear.  This permitted track
           increase is separate from any track increased realized by installing
           permitted wider wheels, as long as such wheels have the
           standard Porsche offset.

      (e) Air Cleaner Element:  Any air cleaner element may be used.  The
           stock element housing must be retained.  This allows easier
           engine breathing without putting the engine at risk.

      (f) Mufflers:  Any muffler may be used, subject to site and
           instruction noise limitations.

      (g) CIS Components:  Early model CIS components may be replaced
           with corresponding later model components, except that the
           throttle base diameter may not be changed.

      (h) Solex:  All 356s are permitted Solex 40 P11 carburetors and
           corresponding intake manifolds.  For these carburetors only,
           jetting is free.

      (i) Chips/Rev Limiters/Ignition System:  Alternate DME computer
           chips may be used.  The stock rev limiter may be altered or
           substituted.  Electronic and transistor systems are permitted as
           long as the stock distributor is used.  The distributor may be
           recurved.  Bosch units that were standard for the engine may be
           substituted for Mirelli distributors.

      (j) Side Shifters:  914s may update to the late style side shift
           transmission linkage.

      (k) Tower Braces:  A front shock tower brace is permitted, limited to
           two mounting points on an existing part of the shock tower and
           a horizontal bar not more than 1.5" in diameter.

      (l) Turbo Tie Rod Ends:  911 turbo tie rods may be installed.

      (m) Adjustable Spring Plates:  Cars built before 1977 may install
           adjustable spring plates.  This provision for cars built before 1977
           recognizes that many such cars may be in need of replacement
           spring plates; for the competitive driver, the logical such choice
           may be the adjustable spring plates.  However, the newer cars
           are not likely to have worn out the spring plate bushings, and to
           allow them to change to the adjustable spring plates would tend
           to push all owners into making this somewhat expensive change
           in order to remain competitive.

      (n) 914 Rear Springs:  914's may run 140-lb. rear springs.  This
           allows the 914s to avoid buying a rear sway bar for the Improved
           Category which will likely be discarded if/when the car is
           prepared for Production Category.

      (o) Tire Types:  Any DOT-approved street tire may be used.  Racing
           tires are not permitted.  The Drivers Events Committee may
           designate any tire as a race tire.  Recapped tires are not allowed.

      (p) Tire Wear:  All tires must be DOT approved.  At all times,
           including after the last timed run, the tires must not show casing
           cord on the surface.

      (q) Tire & Wheel Sizes:  Appendix A shows the allowable sizes for
           tires and wheels.  In the Improved Category, drivers may include
           the '+' number.  Thus, if the listing shows 6 + 1, the driver may
           use a 7" wheel.  The upgrade in wheel width is permitted for this
           category as many drivers will want an extra set of wheels (one
           for street tires, one for sticky tires), and would prefer the wheels
           that offer the greatest performance.

      (r) Brake Cooling:  Brake cooling devices that attach to the spindle,
           but do not require more than 6" of tubing, are permitted.  This
           permits the CoolBrake approach, without getting into front
           spoilers and airflow hoses.  The increased cooling is appropriate
           for aggressive street use and a safety improvement for time
           trials.

      (s) Brake Bias Valves:  A brake bias valve may be installed as long as
           it does not provide for adjustment from the cockpit.

      (t) Batteries:  Cars delivered with two batteries may remove one of
           them.  The second battery is not really needed, and represents
           an extra maintenance expense when it must be replaced. 
           Alternate batteries may be used, to avoid the expense of the
           very large, late-model batteries, but they must be standard
           automotive batteries and they must be firmly mounted.  No
           motorcycle or mini batteries.

      (u) Camber:  Camber settings are limited to 2x at the front of rear-
           and mid-engined cars, 3x at the rear of rear- and mid-engined
           cars, 3x at the front of front-engined cars and 2x at the rear of
           front-engined cars.  Camber measurements shall be the average
           of the readings from both sides of the car, with the driver seated
           in the driver seat.  This is to compensate for the lack of a known
           perfectly level surface when measuring camber in the field.
           Limiting camber creates an even playing field for cars which may
           show variations from the factory in how much negative camber
           they can achieve through normal adjustments.

      (v) Thermal Reactors & Catalytic Converters:  Thermal reactors or
           catalytic converters may be replaced by a straight pipe, as long
           as no change is made to the headers.  This is to provide for
           longer engine life, as these components increase engine
           temperature and shorten engine life, especially under
           competition conditions.



4.3 PRODUCTION CATEGORY
      (a) Purpose:  The Production Category provides competition
           opportunity for drivers who want to get the most out of their
           Porsche, yet keep it reasonably streetable.  Relatively more
           expensive and non-reversable modifications are allowed,
           compared to the Improved Category.  Additionally, some
           modifications are permitted which trade increased power in
           performance for some decrease in engine reliability and
           longevity.  The changes are still limited, compared to the Super
           Street Category, but more to protect the integrity of the classes
           than for any other reason.  While the modifications allowed may
           result in a car that is somewhat streetable, and could be driven to
           the event, there is no requirement that the car have valid
           registration.

      (b) All modifications permitted in the Stock and Improved
           Categories are permitted.

      (c) Track Increase:  Through the use of wheel spacers or wheels with
           non-standard offsets, the track width of the car may be increased
           over stock by .5" per side, front and rear.  This is instead of, not
           in addition to, the increase permitted in the Improved Category. 
           This permitted track increase is separate from any track increased
           realized by installing permitted wider wheels, as long as such
           wheels have the standard Porsche offset.

      (d) Tails/Wings:  Rear spoiler leading edge must be attached to the
           car.  911/912 Porsches may run rear spoilers with dimensions
           equivalent to 911 stock Carrera or Turbo spoilers or smaller.  Rear
           vision must not be impaired.  Spoilers may not extend past the
           width of a factory stock-bodied the car.  A 914 may run a rear
           spoiler, not to exceed five (5) inches in height and not to exceed
           the width of the body.  Any 924 may run rear spoilers with
           dimensions equivalent to the 924 Turbo or 924 Carrera rear
           spoilers.  Any 928 may run a rear spoiler equivalent to a 928S
           rear spoiler.

      (e) Air Cleaner:  Any air cleaner element/housing may be used, or
           may be removed entirely.

      (f) Airflow:  Throttle bodies or venturis may be altered.  Airflow
           sensors may be altered or substituted.  Velocity stacks are
           permitted.  Jet sizes may be changed.  Turbo boost may be
           altered.  A different turbo unit and/or intercooler may be used,
           but multi-turbos are not permitted.

      (g) Flywheel:  A lightened flywheel/clutch/pressure plate assembly
           may be used.

      (h) Compression Ratio:  The compression ratio may be increased by
           .5 points.  This is a reasonable approach when rebuilding an
           engine.  Note that changing a 2.0 liter 4-cylinder to European
           pistons has the effect of raising compression by about .5 points;
           in such cases, no further compression increases are permitted.

      (i) Roller Cranks:  For 356s, any roller bearing crankshaft is
           permitted, provided the standard stroke is maintained.

      (j) Catalytic Converters/Thermal Reactors:  Catalytic converters and
           thermal reactors may be removed.  This is not allowed in the
           Improved Category, to support the streetability of those cars, but
           is appropriate for a car that is moving toward being primarily
           used for competition.  This also allows reasonable choices of
           exhaust header systems.

      (k) Exhaust Systems:  Alternate exhaust headers may be used. 
           Heaters may be removed.

      (l) Limited-Slip Differentials:  All cars may use any limited slip
           differential.

      (m) Airdams, Valance Panels:  An alternate airdam is permitted,
           provided that it does not extend past the forward edge of the
           bumper and does not extend to less than three (3) inches above
           the ground.  Replacement of the front valance panel/bumper and
           removal of the rear valance panel is permitted.

      (n) 356 Bumpers:  356s may remove bumpers.

      (o) Adjustable Spring Plates:  All cars may install adjustable spring
           plates.

      (p) Shocks:  Any shock absorber may be used.  

      (q) Plastic or Metal Bushings:  Plastic or metal bushing may be
           substituted for rubber.  This includes replacing shock-top rubber
           bushing with alternate materials.

      (r) Torsion Bars & Springs:  Alternate torsion bars and springs may
           be used.

      (t) Seats: Any seats may be used.  Two seats are required.

      (u) Brakes:  Brake cooling devices and systems which route air to
           the braking system are permitted.  914-4s may substitute calipers
           and rotors only from any 914.  The expense of changing the
           entire hub to upgrade 914 brakes is too severe.  914-6s may
           substitute calipers and rotors from any 911.  Calipers and rotors
           are free for all other Porsches.  For these cars, reasonable
           aftermarket brakes exist and are permitted in the interests of
           increased safety.

      (v) Battery Location:  Batteries may be relocated.

      (w) Fuel Cells:  Fuel cells may be used, but must be as close as
           possible to the same location as the original fuel tank.  In no case
           can the fuel cell be mounted closer to the center of the car than
           the original fuel tank.

      (x) Sway Bars:  All cars may use any sway bar.

      (y) Distributors:  Any distributor may be used.  Crankfire ignition is
           permitted.

      (z) Steering Wheels with Airbags:  Any steering wheel may be used,
           even if a steering wheel equipped with an airbag is removed.



4.4 SUPER-PRODUCTION CATEGORY
      (a)  Purpose:  This category is for cars that have been modified
           beyond the requirements of the Production Category only in very
           explicit ways.  Otherwise, all Production Category requirements
           are in effect.  This category provides a logical development
           pathway to Super Street.  Additionally, it provides a proper home
           for 3.2L conversions, as long as they are not modified beyond
           the limitations of the Production Category.

      (b) Class Bx:  For 4-cyliner, aircooled Porsches.  Maximum engine
           size is 2055cc.  Such a motor must be a legal, Production-
           Category motor.  Any DOT tire may be used.  Participants may
           choose either to: 

           ~ change to curburetors, or to

           ~ increase wheel width up to 8 inches.

      (c) Class Fx:  For all 6-cylinder, air-cooled engines, non-turbo. 
           Drivers may select either to 

           ~ upgrade tires and wheels (Any DOT tire may be used.  Wheels
           are free up to 8 inches in width.), or to 

           ~ run a non-original motor which would, in its original car, be a
           permissible motor in the Production Category, to a maximum of
           3.2 liters.


4.5 PRODIFIED CATEGORY
      (a) Due to the special capability of the 914 to provide race-car
           performance within very tight budget constraints, three Prodified
           classes are provided.

      (b) All modifications permitted to 914s in the Stock, Improved, and
           Production Categories are permitted.

      (c) Suspension modifications accomplished by machining or welding
           are permitted.

      (d) Drilling or grooving of brake rotors is permitted.  

      (e) Racing tires are permitted.  Tires that do not meet the size
           requirements of the Production Category, but which otherwise
           would be allowable in the Production Category, are permitted.

      (f) Rim widths are limited to 7" maximum.  Rim diameter is limited
           to 15" minimum.  Offset wheels are permitted.

      (g) Non standard gearing is permitted.

      (h) Float bowl baffling is permitted.

      (i) Compression ratio may be increased.

      (j) A track width increase up to 2" is permitted, along with wheel
           spacers and replacement wheel studs.

      (k) Locked differentials are permitted.

      (l) Any front air dam may be installed, provided it does not extend
           forward of the stock front bumper (excluding bumperettes), and
           does not extend rearward of the front wheel centerline.  Removal
           of the front valance panel/bumper and the rear valance is
           permitted.

      (m) Any rear aerodynamic device is permitted provided:
                 i.  It is within a 5-inch perimeter at the contour of a factory
                 stock car as viewed from above.
                 ii.  There is no forward-facing gap between the device and the
                 body of the car for the central 30 inches.
                 iii.  It does not extend closer than 6" to the ground.

      (n) Any brand pistons and cylinders may be used.  Overbore up to
           1.2 mm over stock is permitted.

      (o) Fiberglas fenders, hood, rear deck lid, engine cover, and rear
           bumpers may be substituted for the stock components.  Fiberglas
           doors are not permitted.



4.6 STREET MODIFIED CATEGORY
      (a) This is a category for highly modified cars that are still driven on
           the street.  Basically anything goes.  

      (b) Batteries:  Any battery may be used.

      (c) Tires:
           ~ Street tires: Any street tire/wheel combination may be used. 
           Tires must be DOT approved.

           ~ Race Tires:  Race tires may be used, but may not be mounted
           on wheels wider than seven (7) inches or one inch wider than
           stock, whichever is greater.  This leaves open the possibility of
           cars being competitive on very large street tires.

      (d) Interior:  The car must have full upholstery, carpeting and two
           seats.  This keeps the category separate from the Modified
           Category.

      (e) Fuel Tank Location:  Fuel tanks/cells may be relocated, but not
           into the passenger compartment.

      (f) Porsche:  The chassis, engine and transmission must be Porsche.

      (g) Glass:  The car must have full glass (no plexiglas windows).

      (h) Electrical:  Headlights, taillights, brake lights and turn signals
           must work.

      (i) Induction System:  Twin turbos may be used.  Fuel mixture may
           be any injection or carburetion system.  These changes are not
           permitted in the Production Category due to high costs.

      (j) Engine Parts:  Different cams may be used.  Any brand pistons
           and cylinders is permitted.  These changes are not permitted in
           the Production Category due to high costs.

      (k) Gears, Ring & Pinion:  Different gears and/or ring & pinion may
           be used.  These changes are not permitted in the Production
           Category due to high costs, and to maintain the integrity of the
           classes.

      (l) Tails, Wings, Airdams:  Any tail, wing or airdam is permitted. 
           The rear device may not obstruct rear vision.

      (m) Brake Bias Valves:  Any brake bias valve may be used.

      (n) Suspension Struts:  Any suspension strut may be used, except
           class Bs.

      (o) Camber:  Camber settings are free.

      (p) Welding/Machining:  Suspension modifications through welding
           or machining are permitted.



4.7 MODIFIED CATEGORY
      (a) Intention:  The Modified Category is intended for competition
           between production-model based cars.  Drivers of factory-built
           race cars are encouraged to enter them in the Exhibition
           Category.

      (b) Limitations:  Modified Category cars are those that exceed the
           limits permitted in the Super Street Category.  An original
           Porsche unibody (defined as: the rocker box section on both sides
           of the passenger compartment, the door posts for mounting the
           original door hinges, and the central tunnel through the
           passenger compartment.  These must remain in their original
           factory position.) is required and may be modified.  Bracing and
           supplemental stiffeners may be added.  Engine and transmission
           must be Porsche.  The original unibody suspension type and
           number of suspension pick-up points must be retained.  It is
           prohibited to attach multi-link front or rear suspension if not
           originally utilized.

      (c) Rollbars & Cages:  Full roll cages are required on time trial cars. 
           Roll bars and/or cages are recommended on autocross cars.



4.8 EXHIBITION CATEGORY
      (a) Exhibition Category is for cars that do not conform to any of the
           other categories or for drivers who want to enjoy running their
           cars without interefering with other drivers' efforts to earn points
           and awards.  (Drivers of Historic Porsches and of factory race cars
           are encouraged to participate in Exhibition Category).  There is a
           Class EX in which cars that participate are eligible for times and
           event trophies but not for year-end awards.

      (b) Exhibition cars are subject to all safety rules with allowance
           given for original equipment.  Original factory equipment not
           consistent with Porsche Club rules may be approved by the event
           chairman and chief tech inspector upon inspection of the car and
           equipment.



Three appendices, Appendix A:  Car Classes, Tires and Wheels, Appendix B:  
Summary of Classes, and Appendix C:  Summary of Modifications, could not be 
reduced from WordPerfect into straight ASCII text, without retyping them in 
their entirety.  It was not clear to the author that this effort was 
justified.  Further, it's not at all clear that the appendicies are going to 
fit very nicely into 80 columns, though it should be close.  This is all 
somewhat unfortunate, as the appendicies provide a very nice overview of the
classes and the rules.

The appendices mentioned above are nice.  If anyone **REALLY** needs
them, drop me e-mail and I'll see what I can do.  Please keep in

I think you mean the PAP Swap Meet. PAR is up in NY somewhere. Yes, it's on for
Saturday, April 3 all day. It's a bit too far for me, but I have attended in
the past and it is a good one. And it gets bigger every year. 

While we're on swap meets, the east coast Grandaddy of all Porsche swaps is
coming up on the 24th at Ski Roundtop, PA., rain or shine. Even some of the
California crowd comes to that one (as buyers and sellers). See you there.

Subject: Finalizing my decision.


	It's me again. I've been quietly reading the list and compiling
info, now I have decided on a car: a '86 (87?) 944S.

	Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get much info on this car. I
haven't seen any in the automotive classifieds so don't know how much they
would cost.

	First of all, how much are they worth?

	Secondly, are they good cars?

	Thirdly, how do they compare to the regular 944 and the 944 turbo
in regards to the first two questions? 

	Thanks for any info anyone can give.

  While we're talking swap meets, for those of us in Northern California,
Automotion will be holding their swap meet from 8AM-3PM on Sunday Apr 18
at their "new" location a few minutes away. Check out Automotion's ad in
the new issue of Excellence for their address/phone number. I went to this
swap meet a couple of years ago, and was pleased with the types of parts
available as well as the Porsches that were on display (kind of a "mini-
concours" setup).

Yep!  You got the address right. But pick my brain about
accessing the archives you must be joking. I only started
playing around with these mailing lists three weeks ago.
I haven't even been able to completely transfer any files
from the archives into a readable format. The main problem
being that I am using a system other than a Unix based one
so things are little different.

However, the subject of the Jazz Fest is ont that I can help
with.  What do youneed to know? I'll go ahead and give you
some info now.  The dates are firmed up but the bands and acts
are subject to change.

in advance, $13.00 after the start of each Festival Weekend. Kid's
tickets are $1.50 and $2.00 respectively.

Subject: I can't get my decklid open

Hi,
I need the advice of those of you out there w/ 914's.
My name is Brendin Harb and I'm new to the mailing list. I have
a 1972 914 and I can't get my front decklid open from inside the
passenger compartment. The problem is that the lever for the release
has a lock on it. I have the right key but the cylinder won't turn
the necessary 90 degrees to unlock itself. Has anyone else experienced
this problem before? I'm trying to remove the existing cable ro replace
it. Can anyone offer any suggestions so I don't have to pay for a
locksmith?

Thanks for any ideas,
B. Harb

I'll be at the one in PA.  Unfortunately, it seems to rain most years,
probably keeping some of the best cars away.

A few years ago I found a rear brake caliper for my 914.  It was on a 
car that was parked and got hit by a truck.  The owner towed it there
to sell the whole or parts.  I had to spend at least an hour cutting
the bent rear trailing arm to get it off. :(

Anybody else going to Ski Roundtop?
