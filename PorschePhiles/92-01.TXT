Subject: Dr. Bender

Anyone know a Dr. Bender in CVR region?  I am toying with the idea of
purchacing his old 84 911 Euro Carrera from a dealer in NYC.

Any thoughts on that specific car or euro-carreras in general?  The car
is supposed to have 231HP, versus 207 for stateside models.

I think you will find that the hp is the same as the U.S.  Porsche has always
been conservative on hp figures and for the Carerra, they, for example, raised
the U.S. Carerra figure to about 220 in 1986 or 87 after they found that the
higher figure was in fact more typical of what the engines were producing.  
There were no mechanical changes to account for the increase..

the difference between 220 and 231 is probably just the brain box and fuel
distributor.

Buying a Euro model will cause more hassle, because you will have to get 
Euro parts for a number of small niggling items and your dealer probably will
not have them in stock.  I would discount the price of a Euro model for the 
hassle.

I own a Euro 911SC, and it really does make more power than the  state-side
version. A couple of caveats:

1) make double damn sure that you have copies of *ALL* of the federalization
   paperwork. Just in case.

2) make sure you can find a mechanic who can service the car *before* buying
   it. It took me quite a while to find someone that could deal with the 
   mix-and-match engine components that were used to federalize the car
   (and get me another 35 HP at the same time). The end result was much
   less than spectacular performance until I tripped across my current 
   mechanic, who also races and builds race engines (including the odd 962
   from time to time).

3) develop contacts in Europe, just in case.

4) Enjoy.

Well I took off the tires and wheels from my 66 911s to see what could be
causing the right front corner to ride higher 1/2" than the rest of it, and
noticed that I am missing the Camber and Toe Excentrics for the right side.
I guess I'll have to order those from the factory.  

Now, since I am going to be doing all this work to the suspension, does
anyone have any good recomendations for a setting for wheel alignment? I
think that mostly I'll be using this car for daily driving and an occaisional
track session, so keep that in mind.

The car has been lowered in the back about 2" and the front about 1 1/2" and
has a great deal of negative camber in the rear, I don't know that I want
this since I sometimes bottom out on my driveway.

I await your collective net wisdom.

Miq,

Don't order them from the factory. You're practically sitting on top of
one of the top Porsche (and MBZ if you care) dismantlers in the country.
Call up EASY in Berkeley. Don't have the number, but it's in Pano from
time to time, and the guys at Automotion (also in your back yard) can
give you pointers.

Geeze. Some people.... 8{)

Folks -

Just received a recall notice for 944S cars from PCNA.  Seems there is a problem
with something called a power steering switch.  If you have a 944S but PCNA
doesn't know about you, you can fill out a card at any dealership and find your
way into their database.  Ditto, 'natch, for any Porsche car.

I think this recall is for real, because the cable from a sender or switch on my
power steering pump caught on fire big time on the way home this evening!  Quite
a mess, and quite a traumatic engine shutdown: ba-WOMP!  The circuit doesn't
appear to have been fused, and things just burnt themselves out, travelling
quite a distance in the harness.  Fortunately, the car restarted and I got the
rest of the way home without a hitch.

In the holiday rush I neglected to send out the coupons, which expired
12-25, for Autohority software.  They were for 15%.  If anyone is still
interested I'll extend the offer personally for 15% off (plus shipping)
on the software available.

If you are interested let me know and I'll make arrangements to get
whatever you desire.  The only catch is that they have to be sold
through me but can be shipped from Autothority directly to the buyer so
your name gets on their database.

Whatever, I'm a dealer and a little extra volume never hurts.

$595 - 15% means 505 + 10.00 ship ?

Horsepower goes from 217 (stock) to 245-280 depending onm how much boost
you run.  245 is .7 bar (stock) and 280 is .82 bar.

It makes a SUSTANTIAL improvement, 0-60 in the 5.0 second range, etc.

The raw figures do not tell the whole story though, because the chips
move the redline from 6500 to 6900 and boost comes in at about 3500
instaed of 4000 and lagging.  Peak torque is reached MUCH lower.

Anyone who has the chips knows what I'm talking about.  It's very
subntle since the power is so low and even there is not sudden "HOLY
SHIT BOOST" effect.

I can fax hp/torque curves if you're really interested.

I really have no idea.  The setup I use is very different from that one.  I
don't recall the particulars of that article, but I remember they used 5-6
degrees of caster, and toe-in all around.

I use as much caster as I can get (about 8-9 degrees), and as much negative
camber up front as I can get (about 0.5 degrees).  I've been experimenting
with front toe, but haven't settled on anything...  Zero seems to work
pretty well.

In the rear, I'm currently using zero toe and about 1.5 or 2.0 degrees
negative camber.  This may change; I think I've got too much negative camber
right now.

Well, your CV joints will last longer that way...  I'd go as low as you can
without bottoming out.  Try it pretty low, and if you feel bottoming, raise
it up a little.

Subject: antenna motor and mass


I own an 84 Porsche 944 and I'm experiencing some problems with the 
antenna motor and mast.  The motor quit working several months back 
though fortunately enough the mast was upright. I just let it go until
recently when the mast was bent.  I'm now afraid that the mast will 
break (causing more problems), so I'm checking into correcting both 
problems. Here's a few questions I'd like to toss out to anyone who could 
help.

Is this a common problem for the antenna motor to fail in the 944? Could
this be an electrical problem that I could fix or possibly a burnout
motor (lack of mast lubrication), which more than likely will require
a new replacement motor? I definitely need a new antenna mast which I 
found at Tweeks Automotive in Indianapolis for around $30 and the antenna
motor for around $220.  Is there a better place to shop for these parts?
Could anyone tell me the difficulty rating, special tools, etc in 
replacing an antenna motor and/or mast?

If you can answer any of these questions it would be greatly appreciated.
Thank alot!

} 

It is semi-user adjustable.  You can change it by changing the "Boost
Bolt", a banjo bolt on the intercooler to intake run.  The .82 bar bolt
has a restriction in it.  .7 bar is stock.  You can make up different
bolts to go fom .7 to about 1 bar.

When I'm in my office I'll fax stuff out.


Autothority also has a "selectable" chip set, for $119 (I think) you can
buy a remote key that selects between 3 mappings, such as 87 octane
econonmy, stock, power (2.5 mode) valet (max 3000 RPM) etc.  You can
select the three modes to the best of my knowledge.  It cones with a
small under the dash mounted switchbox thet uses a vending-machine type
key.  Apparently it overrides the altitude sensor which is normally used
to select tween mappings.

FYI,

If you are considering replacing the antenna system, and you can stand the 
thought of an aftermarket antenna, I am very pleased with the system I used
to replace my stock antenna when it broke. It is a stubby mast with booster:
only 1 foot tall when extended, but the reception is far better than the
stock antenna ever gave. If interested, send me mail and I'll get the specs
for you. Oh, yeah, the best part was the price: $150 for the whole system,
motor, mast, and booster.

Subject: 84 944 Antenna

The Hirsch antenna which is factory original from Porsche, Audi,
Mercedes, etc. is quite expensive (on the order of $300 per unit)
with very little discounting.

When my (83 944) antenna crapped out, I replaced it with a Hirsch
5091 antenna (it comes with either a black or chrome mast) which
I obtained from Crutchfield for about $75.  I'm happy, my accountant
is happy, and it works just fine for me.

The effort to replace it was about an hour's worth.  It's not perfect
(concours) but I track the car and used the $200 to buy a 5 point
harness instead.

Steve -

Imparts sells several replacements for the part, some of which say Hirschman,
and some of which don't.  Available in silver or black, I believe.  Cost is well
under $100 per unit; my catalog is at the office.  800 325 9043.  They are
generally among the cheapest sources for the selection of things they carry.

It is apparently important that one periodically lubricate the antenna.  I
believe the right thing to do is wipe a thin coat of light weight oil on the
extended antenna, say, once a month.

If you think it would help (and it probably couldn't hurt), you might try fixing
the unit you have.  Start by cleaning the mast, say, with electronic contact
cleaner or rubbing alcohol, followed by lubricating it.  If this doesn't work,
the next step would be to open the motor assembly itself and do a little
checking.  (It appears from the picture that the motor case opens via a number
of screws.)  Test the motor for electrical continuity - perhaps with time a
contact has corroded (very common) or a wire has frayed and broken.  If you can
get to them, clean the commutator and check the shoes for depth and electrical
continuity.  If the shoes are worn away or any mechanical gears appear stripped,
stop and call the above phone number!

Assuming the motor now works (makes noises but stuff doesn't move), perhaps it
is mechanically jammed.  Clean whatever you can, replace old or missing
lubrication with fresh.  I don't know what the right packing grease is, but I
have used the Bosch stuff sold by a bunch of aftermarket places for speedo
cables, distributors, and whatnot.  It's labelled "Ft 1 v 4", has Bosch part no.
5 700 002 005, and has the consistency and appearance of ear wax.  Wheel bearing
grease might be OK too, but the Bosch stuff seems to stay put better.

Electric motors are real simple things; don't be afraid to give it a try
yourself.  The worst you can do is end up having to replace it, anyways!  My
fresh air fan started making an annoying ticking noise about two years after
purchase.  I took it completely apart, cleaned it, and lubricated with white
lithium grease.  Which melted away.  Then wheel bearing grease.  Which melted
away.  Finally the Bosch stuff, and it's been perfect ever since.  Also did the 
moon roof motor; no sweat.

After reading the messages about antennas that won't
retract, I remembered this article in our newsletter dealing
with the subject.

                  "Having the Right Tool"
                     by Mark Prusynski
                  Silver Sage Region, PCA
          reprinted from "The Sage Tick" July 1991
                              
Shortly before BBB, I had an oil line leak on my 911. After
seeing a small pond on the garage floor I decided it was an
emergency. Luckily, Motorsports Northwest could get it in
and out in one day. When I went to pick the car up I was
shooting the breeze with Red Jones. He told me there were
three of Russ Fereday's former Porsches in his shop that
day. Quite a coincidence!

I was bragging that the oil line leak was the first trouble
I had with my 911 except for the automatic antenna that
wouldn't retract. Red turned around saying, "You just need
the right tool!," picked up a 16 ounce ball peen hammer, and
hurried toward my car. Since I didn't know Red's psychiatric
history, I chased him out the door yelling "Stay away from
my car with that thing!" He replied, "You have to know where
to hit it." Several places flashed through my mind, the most
logical being the top of the antenna, thinking he would
pound it down. Before I could stop him, Red tapped the
bottom of the antenna under the fender and it retracted
immediately.

After I calmed down and Red gave me a liberal dose of B.S.
about the size and model number of the hammer, he explained
that the electrical contacts stick and need to be jarred.
The antenna operated properly until I took the car back for
rear brake pads and the BBB tech inspection. This time, Red
grabbed a claw hammer left by the sheetrockers who were
doing the ceiling. I calmly watched although several
spectators gave both of us some strong looks.

The claw  hammer required  two taps,  which might prove that
the ball  peen hammer  is "the right tool", but I have since
mastered the  art of  hitting it  with my  hand. This proves
having the  right tool  is not as important as knowing where
to hit it, but it's not nearly as dramatic.

I think a manual antenna is much more trouble free and only requires the one
tool that is always handy... your hand.

Subject: 914 roll cage question
Cc: autox@autox.team.net, wheeltowheel@abingdon.sun.com

We're having a minor controversy down here in Houston, and if you
have any experience at installing AutoPower weld-in roll cages in 
Porsche 914's, I'd appreciate your comments. If you don't, you
might want to hit 'n' now.... I'm posting this to multiple lists,
so my appologies if you get it more than once.

I've looked at a couple of installations which have the four corner
posts attached to the door sill, and a couple which have the down tubes
bent a little and attached to the floor pan. I'm confused.

* what is the prefered way, and why? (both what you do and what have you
  seen, I guess, with pro/con analysis if possible)

* how is it possible to attach to the door sill and still have the top
  go on? I'm guessing you have to shorten the legs before welding to get
  to work, but how much?

* what about the top door cross-bar? I need to move it down, or I'm gonna
  only be able to get into the car on the passenger side... Any comments?

If it matters, this is for a GT-3 car under construction. I'm also open to
custom fab of a cage if that makes more sense...

Also, if anyone has any info on the George Vellios "911SC-trailing-arms-and
brakes" kit for the 914, I want to hear about it. George hasn't been answering
his phone for a week or so, and I want info NOW....

Subject: sticker shock?


>From Jan 6 issue of _Autoweek_ ...

WHAT A DEAL.  Porsche has announced 1992 prices, and in an effort
to boost its poor sales, the company announced a $39,850 sticker
price on the 968.  That's not only substantially less than we thought
it would be, but less than the cost of the car it replaces, the 944
(the 1991 944 carried a $43,350 base price).  That's just for the base
coupe, however.  Order the Tiptronic-equipped coupe and you're looking
at $43,000.  The most expensive 968 you can buy is the Cabriolet with
Tiptronic.  It sells for $54,150.  The Carrera line starts at $63,900,
the 928 at $80,920 and the 911 Turbo at $98,875.


... ladies and gentlemen, start your checkbooks. :-)

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]

Those of you who are tired of getting loads of tiny messages can now get
one big message per day!!! I finally got the Right Software to build 
digests with, and can offer Porschephiles in a digest format. You'll 
lose some of the immediacy, but if you're like me, you usually only check
mail a few times a day anyway....

The format used in this digest is compatible with the MH "burst" command,
and probably anything else that uses similar technology. 

If you want me to change you from direct mail to digest, please let me know,
either by direct reply, or mail to "porshcephiles-request@karazm.math.uh.edu".

Hi - '69 912 here (all stock daily driver)...

First, I want to thank those of you who helped me with my tire size 
problem (what tire size to replace the almost-obsolete P185/70-15 with).

I just bought a set of P205/60-15 Yokohama A378's (like I said, I don't
race, but daily use is my need - the A378 is a M+S [though you'd never 
know it by looking] as I need the extra traction now and then).  Clearance
in the front is slightly improved (though it was never a problem in the
first place), but it's a little tighter in the rear, owing to the fact that
this tire is a shade wider in the sidewall - still the rear tires haven't
hit the fender, yet :-) .  I got the whole set for about $450 (including
tax, installation, balancing), which is less than I was prepared to spend.
For about $550 I could have had P6's (the ONLY P185/70-15 I could find), 
but money after all was an object.

Say, I got something called 'Accubalance' done - apparently they make sure
the tire/wheel is *round* as well as actually balanced.  Anybody have
experience with this (ie. good or bad decision)?

If it's anything like what we used to call "matching", where the mounted
tire/wheel was rotated on a device that ground rubber off the tire until
the whole assembly was concentric with regard to the mounting holes, then
it's a LARGE win. It's just hard to find people to do it these days...

Making sure the tire is round is something we owners of early 944s have 
to do. Where did you get the "Accubalance" done? It's not that I'd drive to
California (except to go to the '92 Parade :-) to get my tires balanced, but
it might give me an idea of where to look locally (maybe a chain does it
in all their shops).

Thanks for the info.

Subject: Tires for 944 turbo

Greetings,

I recently purchased a 1988 944 turbo with 26,000 miles on the clock.
The original Dunlop D40M2 tires need replacement.  I'm looking for good
street tires, with excellent dry traction, and good wet traction.  The 
car will not be raced.  I was wondering if anyone had strong opinions
on tires, good or bad (especially tires to avoid!).  Otherwise, I'll
probably just get new D40M2's.

OK, who all is going to be at USENIX? How about a Porschephiles BOF?
And, possibly, a trip to one of the area Malibu Grand Prix with the

Please respond by mail, and I'll post a summary.

Subject: 928 Wheels


Hello fellow porschephiles,

I am in search of the wheels for my 1980 928.  I currently
have the 16x7 phone-dials, I am looking for the best
all around performance value wheels that will give me
the correct offset and greatest width.  I have read
the articles in Pano. "Project 928" but the wheels
that Kim Krumb used are very expensive.  The 
"Club Sport" wheels are nice and I have seen some
run on a Flame Job 928 at Grattan MI roadcoarse
in Sept 91.  Phil K. (The owner) said they have
the correct offset but once again, from dealer
or even Robert Wood the wider rims are very
expensive.  The wheels are for track use only so 
I am not that concerned about a few scratches.

The offset is critical for these wheels, I don't 
have the #s right now but if anyone knows of a
"Factory Seconds Outlet" I sure would appreciate
it.

Thanks in advance.

If you want 8" and 9" you may be able to get some Pressure Cast 9" in
53.3mm offset (as new carrera/951/944/968 use).

As for 7 and 8" or 8" all around you may be able to use the 87-88 951
phone dials.  In addition,there have been some 8s and 9s floating around
from the Canadian Cup and S2 series made of magnesium.  The going rate
for these is now about 15-1700 a set.

If you tell me what offset and what rim sizes you need I may be able to
locate something.  The 9" or 9.5" (which BBS, Compomotive and CMW make)
are $$$$.

I have had very good luck with Comp T/A street tires.  I have used them
both on the street and track and they are excellent (and inexpensive)
dry tires.

Ands they do not chunk.

Subject: Tough wheel descisions

I'm having a tough time deciding what to do about track wheels for my
'87 951. The fast 951 drivers in my region are all pushing me to buy 8"
and 9" wheels. After much searching, it has become apparent that the
only decent options are are BBS and the 928GT `club sport' forged
alloys.  A new set of BBS runs about $2k and I can probably find a set
of club sports for $2.4k. In a moment of weakness, I ordered a pair of
8" club sports from Robert Wood (I haven't been able to find any 9's
yet). His advise was to stay away from the cast phone dials since they
bend very easily and won't stand up to abuse on the track (which may
be true - I think one of the front rims on my current set is bent).
However, it would seem to me that the wheels get more abuse on the
street from potholes than they will on the track.

A set of stock phone dials will run between $800 and 900.  I've been
rethinking my priorities and thinking about what I can do with the extra
money (chip, seat, etc.) and am having a very hard time justifying the
extra expense. 

Another possibility is to buy 4 8" phone dials - that way I'd be able to
rotate tires... Has anyone had any experience with 951's set up thusly?
Is the balance thrown way off (that is, does the back end tend to break
loose)? 

I'm about to dial the phone (is there a pun to be had here?) to cancel
my order w/ Robert Wood and start my search for some stock 7" and 8"
phone dials. What's the net.wisdom regarding cast wheels on the track
(and any other relavent comments).

Subject: Parting out 951

We recently purchaced an 86 951.  Red ext on grey beige interior.

Interior parts are mostly good (seats, carpet, etc) as is passenger
door.

Motor internals and head is happy, but the block is history.

It also came with good DME/KLR with autothority 2.5 chips and papers.
Both front and rear suspension are fully intact.  Rear has 26mm torsion
bars (Stock is 24, Turbo S has 25.5).

I also have a front suspension setup from an 89 951S which I may be able
to part with.

Lastly, and 86 NON-LSD transmission.  Good working order, synchros
replaced and internals gone over.

Also many misc parts (Psgr door, switches, complete eng. wiring harness,
alt, A/C compressor, etc.

Anyway, if anyone needs any of this stuff, let me know.

In wheel inventory:

2 86 7x16 Fuchs
2 86 8x16 Fuchs
1 87-88 7x16 Phone
3 87-88 8x16 phones

(2 od the 8x16" phones will be included with turboS front suspension
most likely)

Yes, the car will oversteer like hell if you put on all 8" -w- 245

You can run 225 and 245 on 8" wheels.  This will save conciderable wear
on the front tires.

As for phone dials not standing up to track-That's old robert's sales
ploy.  Why do you think the S2s and canadian cup cars ran MAGNESIUM
phone dials on the track with no problem?  Why do you thing porsche has
completely gotten out of the forged wheel business?

All new P-cars come with pressure cast wheels of the design-90 variety.
A wheel bends from impact, not from hard use.  Chances are if you hit
somtthing hard wnough to bend a phone, the Club Sport would be history
too, because the crossection (especially on the inside) is VERY thin.

Lastly, the phone dials allow you to run brake cooling fans.  These
REALLY work.  With them I was able to run junk pads (repcos) while
running quite respecable times and did not get fade, even without and
cool-brake setup.

My opinion only.....

need a camber adjust after that?  I don't think clearance will be a
problem, as I've gone from P185/70-15 (on Fuchs) to P205/60-15, and have
MORE clearance than before...

I don't know whether this helps, but the offsets are 52.3 mm., same as used on
the MY87-forward 944 series cars.  I don't know what the offsets on
early-seventies cars were, but they may have been 10 or 23 mm.

Mark -

Automotion IS Weltmeister, modulo corporate shenanigans!  I got a break on a set
of Weltmeister bars, a few years back, from Karrousel in MN, a couple hundred
bucks cheaper than Automotion.  I believe they advertize regularly nowadays in
Autoweek and Sports Car.  If you cannot find an ad, let me know and I'll go
digging.  They have an 800 number, if memory serves.

For all practical purposes, if you change the ride height you need to realign
the car.  Or so I am given to believe.

Subject: Wheel specs

Absolutely nobody in the world seems to know the answer to my wheel spec
question...  The center hole and lug hole diameters of a stock 914/4 wheel.
At least, nobody I could get in touch with in a week...  Might be worth
sending to the 914 Tech Q/A guy for the PCA.  I'm having my wheels made up
to the same specs as they make 911 wheels, which is 62mm center hole and
14mm bolt holes.  I have no idea if that's correct either, but that's the
best information I've got right now.

FYI, Mid-Engine Mania is *MUCH* cheaper on Weltmeister parts than Automotion
(aka Weltmeister) or Tweeks.  Almost 20% cheaper.  Performance Products and
Imparts don't generally do Weltmeister.  Other suggestions are still welcome.

Actually, Mid-Engine Mania (aka GPR) is almost always cheaper on Porsche and
OEM parts than anyone else.  I've bought literally thousands of dollars worth
of parts for my last two 914's from them (talk to Dave for 914 parts), and I've
never failed to be satisfied.  They don't have a catalog, so you just have to
call, but they carry just about anything you want.

No, I don't get any sort of commision from MEM.  I'm just a very satisfied
customer, and I want them to do well so that I can continue to buy parts
from them.

Message-Id: <71920117020617/0004056890NA3EM@mcimail.com>

Does anyone know of an after-market source for the switches in the centre
console of an 85 1/2-forward 944 series car?  I am adding something, and would
like a one-position momentary switch.

If all else fails, I'll get from Porsche the switch they use for central
locking.  It has a little key icon on it, which is OK.  What is weird is that
it'll cost me about $32 for the part, whereas the two-position moonroof switch
would only cost me $20.  Go figure.  Must be because the CLS switch has a
951-prefix part number, while the roof has a 944-prefix!

I'm tired of fumbling for the electric garage door opener, and plan to install
it into the dash or centre console, operated by this switch.  I'll probably
share the 12->9 volt DC converter already installed for my Passport, else get a
second one to power it.  It must be obvious that I am running low on projects
for the car!

I got a catalog from an outfit called Damark that is advertizing
Cincinnati Microwave Solo radar detectors (a 9-volt battery-powered
detector from the same folks that make the industry standard Escort
and Passport detectors) for $189+S&H.  This compares to the list price
of $345 I paid some time ago.  These are evidently refurbished units,
a fact that I infer from the comment "Cincinnati Microwave has
double-checked each of these factory serviced units to ensure that
they meet original factory quality standards".  Damark doesn't mention
what kind of warranty comes with these rebuilt units, but a call to
their number 1-800-729-9000 should get the answer.  I'm not in the
market myself; I just thought there might be some interest out there
(except in D.C., Virginia or Connecticut, where the ad claims the
detector is "not available").

P.S.: I have never done business with Damark, so I can't say anything
about them one way or the other.

I bought one of these from them about a year ago, the last time they
had such an offer.  The unit I received was virtually
indistinguishable from new.  No scratches, all accessories, original
packing.  It looked to me as if it came straight from CMI, without
being opened by Damark.  I have been completely satisfied.

(Not that I fully trust companies like Damark.  When I ordered it they
told me there was something like a 30 day no questions ask return
policy.)

Folks- 
 
Does anyone know a shop that does top-quality 911 Targa-to-Cabriolet
conversions?
 
A friend of mine recently stuffed his early-80s 911 "hardback" Targa
under a semi-trailer backwards, and thinks this might be an excellent
time to complete the "conversion" he started.  The damage to the car is
almost all above the beltline; the back window, rear top panel, and
Targa bar are history.  The Targa roof itself is gone, too.
 
The windshield and all that stuff is OK, since the Targa bar stopped
the car.
 
So, it sounds like an excellent prospect for a Cabriolet conversion,
nein?
 
Any suggestions?

Depends on where you are, Shel... I know of two in CA, one in TX, one
in MA. There are doubtless more. Plus, there is at least one kit that
claims to be mostly idiot proof...

More details will yield higher quality responses...

There was a good article in VW & Porsche magazine (now European car) last year about a company that did slant nosed speedster conversions and other similar work, all in metal of course (somewhat rare here in Europe). Might be worth investigating. Not exactly cheap though. Maybe somebody knows which month it was.

As a matter of fact, I just happen to be looking (read drooling) over the
conversion that you speak of (February '92 European car pg. 79).  The
conversion was performed on an '83 SC Targa by a guy named Jake Tomlinson who
has a shop in Auburn, CA.   They chopped the targa in addition to significantly
widening the fender flares, raking the windscreen, etc.  The result looks
pretty impressive (not that I'm going to take a hacksaw to my coupe anytime
in the near future).

Here's the company info:

Yes, I'd suggest not repeating the "experiment" after the conversion is 
complete...

Subject: 944 oil leak 

Hello All,
Well I just returned from a 3,000mi trip from San Diego to Santa Fe NM and
my 85 1/2 944 has sprung a leak.  I cleaned the engine and figured out that
the oil is coming from the front center of the car around the front engine
seal.  It is loosing about 1/2q every 800mi or so.  I looked at the timing
belt through the little viewing hole and it is dry so I think it may be
the lower front engine seal.  I talked to AJR here in San Diego and they said
all the belt covers and belts have to come off and could cost around $400!  Now
I just had the timing belt replaced at 78k and the car now has 85k so it's not a
good time to do the timing belt.  So I would like some advice from
anyone that has experience with this.  Is now the time to cough up the
$200 for the factory manuals because it seems like the job is mostly labor.
I would like to figure out how to replace the timing and balance belts but
if it s very risky I'll pass.   And finally do the factory manuals provide 
a clear explanation of this procedure.  I was also given a membership to 
PCA from my wife for x-mas and I noticed the Fixin up der Porsche series
which I am ordering; any help there?  I really like working on my car but
I would hate to get in over my head.  Thank you for your time.

Subject:  944 Oil Leak Recommendations

1) Yes, the factory service manual is recommended.  However, keep in
   mind that the 944 manual is an adddendum to the 924 manual.  To
   have the "complete" manual, you will need to purchase both ($500).

2) Yes, the 944 manual does have complete instructions on replacing,
   timing, and tensioning all the belts (timing, balance shaft,
   alternator, and power steering).

   However, keep in mind that you will need to obtain a belt tension
   gauge (about $350 from an OEM supplier) to make the adjustments.
   If you do it wrong, it can (and probably will) cost you an engine.
   If you are not an experienced mechanic, you can make big mistakes
   real easy.  I am an experienced mechanic, and I have made big
   mistakes on my 944, but have lived to tell about them.

3) Yes, 7000 miles is not very much use out of a timing belt.
   Recommended change interval is 30K miles.  Since timing belts
   are cheap (10-15 dollars from an OEM) and engines are expensive,
   (and I do own the gauge), I replace mine at 15K miles.
   If you are already in there, you may as well put a new one in
   anyway.

4) Upfixin der Porsche is a great publication.  Make sure you get
   both Volume VII and Volume VIII, which will cover all of the
   problems you will encounter with your 944.

5) Welcome to PCA.  You will get as much out of it as you put into it.

If you do have the work done, make sure that it is done by a good
mechanic.  Perhaps your best bet is to get in touch with your PCA
Region's 944 tech specialist and ask his advice.  It sure would be
cheaper than $400.  (My price would be in the $100 range to replace
the balance shaft seals, in the $150 range to replace the oil pump seal,
and in the $200 range to replace them all.)

	About a year ago, my very perceptive wife provided me with a
birthday gift of factory service manuals (8 volume set) for the 928 series.
Among the first few pages of each volume is a check list pertaining to
updates (corrections or additions) that are periodically made to the
contents of that particular volume.
	My question are: How does one obtain the updates that have
presumably been issued by the factory (or perhaps PCNA)? What is the cost?


				Thanks, Jim

Jim -

My understanding is that it is a little hard to figure out what manual updates
are available.  I believe that PCNA periodically mails dealers an update on new
literature available.  So I guess if your dealer's parts guy keep these
organized, he should be able to go through them in short order and let you know
what's available.  I know that the fellow I use has a hard time tracking updates
down, despite his being the fastest fiche in the east!

When you buy a new factory manual set, PCNA stuffs it with all extant updates. 
So the set your kind wife gave you should have been up to date as of its
purchase.  Figuring out the latest update it has is a bit of a pain.  Look for
pages with roman numerals at the bottom along with newer dates.  This is how
changed and new pages are tagged.

Perhaps the simplest thing to do in your case would be to give Kim Crumb a call.
He's the 928 guy on the PCA national tech committee, and his phone number
appears in the Tech Q&A column's masthead in each issue of Pano.

You can get on the list yourself, at least as far as a postcard announcing
the availablity of each new update. The postcard doesn't describe the
contents, however.

PCNA published a catalogue of literature about a year ago, and it lists
prices for all of the updates to all of the manuals. They range from
$10 to $50 or so each, so fully updating an old manual is not cheap.
Many dealers (at least ours) will let you look at their documentation,
to see what is in each update.  Once you know what you want, the dealers
can order them from PCNA.

When I bought a 944 manual about 1.5 years ago, its "update register"
at the beginning had all of the suplements included already listed.

Subject: 911SC tach mysteries




Just thought I'd resurrect this thread to post the results of my findings.
We were discussing problems with a tach needle that bounced all over the place on
Kevin's 911SC, a situation that I experienced as well.  The difference being
that Kevin's car fixed itself(?) and mine decided to really break.  Well, 
here's what I found:

The alternator on my '82 SC utlizes the Paris-Rhone alternator (read $$$) 
that comes with the voltage regulator as an integral (though easily removable)
unit.  I removed the old VR to find that it has spring-loaded brushes that 
contact the armature.  The brushes were worn significantly.  There were also
deep grooves in the armature where the brushed contact it.  Time for a new
alternator :( .  The alternator/voltage regulator did fix the problem.  

Thanks again to all those who contributed to my initial postings.

Thanks to the various and sundry advice I received a few weeks ago, I set 
out upon replacing the cold start valve in my 79SC.  What a royal pain in
the posterior.

The valve is mounted facing toward the front of the car on the front side
of the engine, in short..invisible unless you work with a mirror.  One also
has to remove the heater fan, boot to the throttle body and vaport recovery
hose to get even limited access.

Oh Yes, if you do this, in addition to ordering the valve, order the  two, 
thats the two O rings, one on the base of the valve nozzle and one for the
inside of the plastic block which you also have to remove to determine if the
O ring still remains after you loosen the valve and block from the throttle
body.  Anyway, once the O rings appear at Lake Forest Sports Cars parts dept.,
I will see if the whole mess can be reassembled and still function.

ALSO,   FOR SALE - 2 6x16 FUCHS alloys, std 911 bolt pattern with half used
BFG Comp T/A Rs,  200 for the pair, plus shipping.  E-Mail or call me at

Drew, if time is not a problem then take the Alt. to
a competent rebuilder.  It should be more cost 
effective.  My Alt. in the 928 went out just before
an event or I would've taken it to a rebuilder,
but one other thing I considered is that the later
928s have an upgraded Alt. and I opted to upgrade,
Iam not sure if that holds true for the Air Cooled.

Good Luck

Can anyone give me advise on an easy way to lower the rear of my '72 911
Targa?!  I autocross/time trial/driver school/hillclimb the car and it
realy needs to be MUCH(!) lower [but not to low-I don't want to run out
of suspension, as this will make the car instantly transition to over-
steer...BIG TIME!!)

Anyways, any help/guidance/suggestions would really be quite helpful!

Many thanks and HAGD,

Mr Wizard

BTW.....I know how to lower the front (seems much easier than the rear)
thanks to the help of Dwight Mitchell (SCCA SOLO II ASP '90 National
Champion-'72 911 T [with the "T" meaning VERY "TRICK" 2.7 ltr race motor).

BTW Again....Anyone out there with a roll bar/cage for a '72 Targa that
they may want to sell (cheap?!?!).  Thanks for any response!

Drew, if time is not a problem then take the Alt. to
a competent rebuilder.  It should be more cost 
effective.  My Alt. in the 928 went out just before
an event or I would've taken it to a rebuilder,
but one other thing I considered is that the later
928s have an upgraded Alt. and I opted to upgrade,
Iam not sure if that holds true for the Air Cooled.

Good Luck 
Later don@cimage.com 

----- End Included Message -----

Upgrade!  Damn, I should have checked on that.  I've seem some reference that
the later models utilize a bosch instead of the Paris-Rhone's.  When I talked
to the local dealer, this was the only option that was given or perhaps they
just smelled a sucker coming ;).   Anyway, I already have the new VR and am
waiting for the replacement Alt. to arrive ( I've already forked out 
the cash ).  Bummer.  Thanks for the info though.  

Regards,
Drew

   I got a catalog from an outfit called Damark that is advertizing
   Cincinnati Microwave Solo radar detectors (a 9-volt battery-powered
   detector from the same folks that make the industry standard Escort
   and Passport detectors) for $189+S&H.  This compares to the list price
   of $345 I paid some time ago.  These are evidently refurbished units,

   ...

   but a call to their number 1-800-729-9000 ...

By the way, they are also selling refurbished Escort DSP units for about
$150.  I just received one from them and it looks like new.  I can't wait
for a chance to test it against my older Passport!

Hey,

I am planning on (hopefully) buying a 914 sometime within the next year.
 I was wondering if anyone could give me any information on these cars. 
Any information of performance- speed, acceleration, upgrades, handling,
suspension, etc.; maintenance- parts availability and pricing; and
anything else you think might be pertinent.

Thanks a lot in advance.

I'm thinking of pulling the engine on my '74 914 2.0 this weekend for
the first time.  I have the Haynes maual and 'How to Rebuild Your
Volkswagen Engine,' both of which have removal instructions for the
914.

If anyone who has done this has any advice or caveats, I'd love to
hear them.

thanks,

 Recently, I purchased one of these units from Damark.  The Solo I got
from them seems to work fine but one interesting feature is notably
missing.  None of the Solo radar detectors from Damark have the
electronic key feature.  (I learned this from conversations with their
customer service people)

 The Electronic key is required after changing batteries to activate
the detector, so in case of theft the detector is rendered useless
without this key.  In the place of the "keyhole" there is a external
speaker/earphone plug.  Strange thing is that the styrofoam packing
conspicuously has an indentation specifically for this electronic key
but there is none and the the included manual similarly makes no mention
of its existence.

 This is something you might want to consider when buying from Damark.
I considered the key an important feature (I live in NYC), but now that
the detector is here and being used...  "oh well".

 Hope this is useful.

I dropped my 73 2.0 engine last year.  One thing which you should have is
the latest Panorama, which has a picture of the wire routing for the entire
fuel injection system for exactly your engine.  Also, consider taking the
half shafts completely off the car instead of tying them up out of the way
like it says in the haynes manual.  I think it will allow you to pull the
assembly out the back with the car a little lower.  On mine, almost all the
bolts for the heat exchangers (head side) broke before turning.  Definitely
take off the deck lid and the trunk lid like they say.  One stupid thing
I did; it was down and I was pulling it out the back and thought I cleared
everything, then hit the dipstick and bent it.  Should have removed it.

I purchased a "remanufactured" Solo from Danmark less than a year ago

   I'm thinking of pulling the engine on my '74 914 2.0 this weekend for
   the first time.
   
914 advice: be careful with the engine tin, its easy to ruin and expensive to
replace.  The engine is lighter than you might think, but you need more
clearance to remove it than you might think.  When you remove the half-shafts
(as someone else suggested), cover the exposed CV joints with plastic wrap.

Generic advice: if you can, take (polaroid) pictures BEFORE you start, and
label EVERY wire, cable and hose.  Use plastic zip-lock bags to store nuts and
bolts, etc. as they are removed and label EVERY baggie (heavy-duty freezer
type are best).

I took the engine out of my '74 914-2.0 a number of times, but not
very recently, so my memory may be a bit hazy in places. With that in
mind, a few comments:

I did find it more convenient with the half shafts completely removed,
but it is quite do-able with them in and tied. From my recollection I
don't see how removing them changes the height you need for the car.
My recollection is that the limiting clearance is the back bumper.
I think you get a bit more clearance by removing the air cleaner.

>bolts for the heat exchangers (head side) broke before turning.  Definitely

Depending on what you plan to do when you get it out, you may not need
to remove the exhaust system at all. The engine/transmission comes
out just fine with the exhaust system still on, muffler and all.
If you do need to take the exhaust system off, it is easiest to do it
with the engine in the car where you can get to the bottom of the engine.

>take off the deck lid and the trunk lid like they say.  One stupid thing

I don't remember any problem with leaving both lids on. Removing
the engine comp. lid makes access to the engine generally easier from 
the top, but the amount of stuff you need to do there to get the
engine out isn't that much. I don't believe I ever took the lids off
to get the engine out. If you do take the lids off, watch for the springs.
there is a lot of stored energy.

Get help. It's not a one-man job unless you have a four-corner lift
and a specially built jig to catch the damned thing when it's finally
clear. (yes, I have access to both, and am considering reverse engineering
blueprints for the jig to post to the group).

Subject: 911 spoiler

I am just about to fit a secondhand carrera RS type spoiler to my '73 911 after the old one was damaged. Unfortunately the previous owner (pillock!) had drilled a few holes in the rubber trim strip to mount the number plate on.

As these trim strips are quite expensive ($150.00) I would like to repair this damage IF possible. I had the idea of filling these holes and then painting the rubber strip with a suitable black rubber paint. The problem is, what could I fill the holes with (4mm diameter) that would be flexible enough not to break down pretty quickly!!?? Any ideas??

Another (stupid!) question, how(i.e. what markings, presumably on the lens) distinguish a headlight (left side) from right side?

I'd say that the Spyder brochure, IF in good (or better) condition, would be worth an awful lot of money. There are shops in the UK that specialize in such things, presumably there are also some in the US. Might be worth finding out what they value it at!

Probably the best person to talk with is Prescott Kelley.  He has run the
literature and memorabilia displays at recent Parades, and is himself an avid
collector.  (He also organized the historic car display at the '91 Parade.)
Nice guy, too!

Prescott has a ton of such literature himself, really neat stuff.

Another possible source of info would be a store in NYC which specializes in
automobile-related art.  The owner is Jacques Vaucher (if memory serves), and
the store name is l'Art et l'Automobile.  Call 212 information for a number.  I
have no idea whether Jacques handles literature.

When asking these guys for a value, be clear on whether you want to sell it or
just get a valuation.  The figures will, of course, be different.

Yes this may be true in the case of your Jetta Kevin, but probably the most
popular VW in the last 15 yrs is the Rabbit which I'll take as VW flagship
purely for the reason that VWs' concentration is on volume.

Also if we are talking about Flagships I'll think you'll have to
agree that Porsches' Flagship is the 911 Turbo, better known as
the 930 (I think you know where I am heading).

So let me take a quick look at my Bosch Fuel Injection Manual
and look up what the 911/930 76-85 uses for a FI system.  Now let me
look up what the VW Rabbit used in 77-80.  They both use the same
K-jetronic FI system.  Furthermore, the 911/930 1986 right up to today,
uses the K-jetronic with Lambda (or better known as an O2 sensor),
which is what the VW Rabbit and the Rabbit GTI used from 1981 onwards.

I am not sure Bosch would consider the last couple of lines

I couldn't agree with you more here Kevin. (IMHO) Bosch is the biggest 
auto-supplier monopoly going.  I was rudely awakened to the fact that the
ECU (On my 84 Volvo 760 Turbo, and all Bosch ECUs) schematics are never 
made public.  Which brings up the whole point of Bosches' scam:
1.) All auto-manufacturers who market a car in the US are required to 
    provide repair manuals (Why are ECU schematics excluded? Yes I can
	 understand the (1) PROM chip not being doco'ed, but not basic items
	 like Power-Supply transistors? (which are usually the problem)).

1a.) Yes, US manufacturers don't supply their schematics either but then
	  the US ECU doesn't cost $1200.00 to replace on a core-charge basis.
	  (US ECUs are typically under $200.00, and it is for a brand new
	   unit NOT a rebuilt unit!).

2.) IBM provides schematics on their PC, why is an ECU schematic any 
	 different?  The EPA arguement doesn't even apply. Just take a look
	 at the aftermarket for performance PROMs.

3.) If I expand on Bosches' lack of technical doco. then lets take the case
	 in which: I have some coolant leaking from my water-pump, I don't know
    how to locate a new water-pump for purchase, or for bearing parts
	 for a rebuild (its just not docuemented).  The answer is I have 
	 to replace the motor.  The parallel I am trying to make here is:
	 I know the power transistor is bad, and Bosches only prescribed fix
	 is to replace the ECU!

>Asking any car salesman to justify the cost of what he's selling is a 
>pretty fruitless endeavor, no?  Beating him up won't change things much! 
>Voting with>your wallet does.  
Yes I'll have to admit I shouldn't have tried to get him to justify the 
cost.  My main motivation was to get him to admit that old line of shit
they preach in Pano; "Owning a Porsche is not merely owning a
material item, it is a LIFESTYLE".  It's just marketing BS!!!!!

>Hey, Porsches are luxury cars!   

I think PCNA would disagree that "Porsches are luxury cars".  I believe 
they would state that they are overall performance cars.  It's not that
Porsches themselves are luxury cars (ie. Mercedes, Rolls etc.) its that
the only persons who can afford new Porsches are persons who fit the 
luxury car demographics, and the owners in general treat the newly 
bought Pcars as such.

>Autocrossing is a luxury too.
Autocrossing is not a luxury! 
(tell some guy autocrossing some ragged out piece of shit
 that autocrossing is a luxury (and don't tell me you've 
 never seen a hunk of shit autox car!))
The whole point of Autoxing is it's low entry $.

>You cannot justify luxury or its cost.
The point about not being able to justify a luxury is irrelevant.
If you still want to belabor the point about justifying a luxury,
you need to compare it to like peers (Autoxing a less expensive
car that gives just as many thrills, although maybe not as thrilling
a lifestyle).

BTW Kevin, I believe it was you that was vehemently opposed to
stainless steel brake lines, do you still hold that opinion?

Folks-
 
At last, a Porsche question I can answer ...

Body shops here in the US have various ways of doing this, and, if well
done, it results in a nearly invisible repair.
 
The best thing I've seen is a kind of soft epoxy called "Dura-Mix;" it is a
two-part goo that is mixed automatically as it is squirted from a double-
barreled caulking gun.  It cures to a flexible, black, rubberoid substance
in about 30 minutes.
 
I've fixed a couple of rubber items with this stuff; you just fill up the
cut or hole (allowing a little extra) and trim it with a razor blade when it
cures.  If you have to match a matte texture, you just hit it with a little
sandpaper.
 
Here in Atlanta you can buy a Dura-Mix kit (gun, goo, mixing "snout" for
gun) at an auto paint and body supply store for about $50.  If you buy
additional mixing snouts (about $1 each) you can fix a lot of rubber with
one pair of goo tubes.  Additional tubes of goo are about $20.
 
Now, I assume they have something the same on your side of the water, but
what it is called, and where you can buy it, I don't have a clue.  The
supply stores here are owned by BASF, but I don't know who actually makes
Dura-Mix.  I'd start with a body shop, though ....

Subject:      924 Turbo Demons



Greetings from the frozen north! I am not yet on this list, although I have
requested that I be added. However, for the time being please reply directly
since I won't see anything you post to the list. Now here's the dilemma:

I have a 924 Turbo ('81) that has suffered.  :-(
Somewhere along the way, some mechanic/demon bastardized my ignition system
by replacing the original distributor with conventional distributor ie.
breaker points and the works. I need advice: Is it possible to make a turboed
engine work properly with conventional ignition? If not, any suggestions on
where to obtain a replacement for the original distributor? Porsche dealers
want absolutely obscene prices for such parts. I also have very little idea
of how much trouble it would be to reinstall the distributor and reconnect the
computer etc.
I am least a hundred miles from the nearest dealer, (not nec. the Best Dealer).
One more weird problem: Does anyone know if the waste gate for the turbo is
adjustable? Or does it require the purchase of a rebuilt turbo to get it
set up right? As it is, the turbo works great up to about 3800 rpm and then if
you "horse it" any harder, it gets the hiccups and dies because the waste gate
opens too soon. Some cars have an adjustment on the waste gate to correct this
problem  but I can't see any sign of such an adjustment on this thing. Of
course trying to find anything in the cramped space under that hood is a
serious undertaking if you don't know precisely where to look.

Apparently the "mechanic" blamed the dying out problem on ignition, which is
why he ripped out the distributor in the first place. There is some justice
in the world though. The "mechanic" went bankrupt.  :-) However, on the
downside, even though I identified the guy responsible, I can't find him
to find out where the original distributor went.  HELP!

Uh, well, I guess I would define "flagship" a bit differently.  Many people were
more than a little disappointed when Porsche shoved an "old" 3.3 litre CIS
engine into the "new" Carrera body+suspension, and asked 100 big ones for the
privilege.  I guess given all the press its getting, and its raw sexiness,
perhaps it could be labelled "flagship."  I had more the four-valvers in mind:
3.6 Carreras, 944S, S2, 928S4 and GT, and 968, all Motronics, the latter three
with hotwire air sensors, the last with its vario-cam.

Well, since you mention IBM (commodity marketing), I might well counter with
Apple's Mac (intellectual property).  Sun flipped from one approach to the other
in the last couple of years.  It is also the case that, whereas the average
mechanic can and will replace waterpumps, there's no way he has the training to
do component-level testing and replacement in DME's.  Nor would it be
cost-effective.  Computer manufacturers do the same thing.  If we have a bad PC
in the office, we see the motherboard (or whatnot) replaced in toto.

Uh, right, well I only meant that I feel pretty lucky to be able to spend as

Yes.  Still waiting to be convinced otherwise, always an open mind.

Ken -

I don't think I can answer any of your questions directly, being basically
ignorant when it comes to the 924 turbo.  I would recommend that you telephone
Charlie Learoyd, 924/944 dude on the PCA national tech committee.  (And join the
PCA while you're at it, if not already a member!)  508 263 4684, evenings.

OK, looking through whatever literature I have, aside from all the usual
"hesitation on acceleration" stuff.  You have a boost-sensitive fuel pump
cut-off switch.  It's role in life is to cut off fuel in the event of
over-boost.  If it's set too low or is dyfunctional, it will cause your symptoms
when the boost comes on.

I would probably start by checking fuel pressure.  The 931 is supposed to get
6.5 bar fuel pressure.  There are two fuel pumps, one inside the tank itself. 
When was the fuel filter last replaced?  How about injectors - clogged or dirty?

I'm surprised that you notice the turbo at all below 3800 RPM.  I would have
though that it doesn't really start to sing until above 4000 RPM.  Are you sure
there's something wrong with the turbo, or is it the engine itself which bogs
down?

I've heard scarey things about how expensive Porsche stuff is up north!  PCA
folks from Upper Canada Region have said very good things about Downtown Fine
Cars in Toronto, a Porsche dealership.  They have also had kind words about
Canadian Pragmatics in Missisauga, an independent.  Perhaps they can help. 
Otherwise, perhaps a US dealer could be convinced to send you parts.  I use Mac
Mackenzie at Clair Parts Express, 1 800 354 5100.

Kevin,

I am a member of PCA. Is it appropriate/Ok/etc to *call* the national
tech committee people directly with questions?

In you reply regarding the 924 turbo, you suggest calling Mr Learoyd. Are
there rules about calling, ie hours, number of times, and so on. Once
in awhile I would love to phone someone up and ask a quick question about
my 944.

My apologies if this is a stupid question...

Unfortunately my boss has pointed out(!!) to me that subcribing to the porsche list alone is costing around $200 per month (we have a bum deal, paying for all incoming and outgoing mail at high rates), and he has to pay it, could I therefore reduce my mail costs. Stupid really as we pay nothing for News, posting or receiving - and think of all the garbage there!!

This means that I will have to unsubscribe unfortunately.

Thanks to everyone who has helped me with problems i've had or enquiries i've made, and to generally brighten up the day of a poor software engineer!!

Suppose i'll have to get the 911 on the road now :-)

I've got a 911 history question about the use of galvanized steel bodies.
One book I have says that Porsche started using galvanized steel on
1976 models. Another book says they did it *mid* year. Anyone have a
diffinitive answer such as "starting with serial number ...". Also,
how about the 76 912E? Did they get the galvanized bodies?

Not having my handy-dandy Bruce Anderson reference book here, I'm doing
this from memory. Let's see, in the mid-70's they started the "long life"
car project, which involved some galvanization. They went through the
process, ending up with the 911SC in '78  which is the first car on which
all of the body panels including all of the tub (excluding various bits
on the Targa roll bar as I recently discovered, but I digress..).

On any car prior to '74, for sure, nothing was galvanized. On any car, from 
I think '75 up, various bits are galvanized. On everything from '78 up, all 
cars fully are galvanized.

BTW, a friend who travels to Germany frequently says that when they started
the long-life project, they dipped a tub and mounted it on some sort of
stand in front of the factory. It's supposedly still there.

Second side note: whatever they use to de-ice roads in Europe eats the
hell out of the underside of the car, irrespective of the galvanizing.
Double check that undercoating if you buy a grey market car!

Yes, you certainly may call them up directly with your questions.  Charlie's
number is his home phone, Mass. time.  I know he gets a fair number of calls,
and answering them is a fairly hefty time committment for him.  I guess as a
rule of thumb I might use the committee when I cannot get an answer from a book,
a local mechanic, or local fellow PCA'ers.

My understanding is that the transition was gradual, as various pieces
of the body were retooled in zinc-clad steel and as existing stocks
were exausted. I believe that at least some parts of many 1975 911's
were galvanized, most parts of most 1976 911's were galvanized,
and 1977 is the first year where you can have confidence that any
particular example is fully galvanized.

I don't know about the 912E specifically, but I believe they simply
took 911 bodies and installed 914-2.0 engines with AFC injection,
so I would expect the above to apply, meaning that your odds are good
of getting an all or mostly galvanized car, but no guarantee.
There is lots on this in the older Upfixin Der Porsche series,
which are sets of reprints from PCA's Panorama magazine.

Re: galvanizing.

In 1969 Porsche started galvanizing the floor pan (except 914s), in 1976, 
midyear, darn near everything became galvanized.
