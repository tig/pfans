# PorschePhiles and PorscheFans mailing list archives

The PorschePhiles mailing list was active from sometime in the late â€™80s through 1996 when it was replaced by PorscheFans. PorscheFans lasted for about 2 years before being superseded by PorscheList (now [www.rennlist.com](www.rennlist.com)) in May 1998. 

When these list servers died, I was working on Microsoft's [Internet Information Server](https://www.iis.net/) and wrote a search engine for the archives as a learning exercise. Through September 26, 2011 "Charlie's Searchable PoracheFans Archive" was hosted at https://www.kindel.com/porsche/pfans/. 

This repo contains all messages from both lists. 

## PorschePhiles

Before PorscheList, and before PorscheFans, there was PorschePhiles. PorschePhiles was a mailing list for Porsche enthusiasts that was active from sometime in early 1990 through 1996. The list was run by Stan
Hanks, AKA "der Listmeister".

All messages sent to the list between April 1990 and July 1995 are available in the ./PorschePhiles folder.

## PorscheFans

When PorschePhiles died in 1995, someone created PorscheFans. On April 22, 1998 the PorscheFans listmaster disabled access to the list digests on www.porschefans.com. 

I had been archiving the digests since I joined the list in 1996, so I decided to make them available to the public. The ./PorscheFans folder contains all messages sent between April 22, 1998 and when PorscheFans was superseded by PorscheList (now www.rennlist.com) (May 25, 1998).
