The Boxsters Have Landed Update #3

Due to potential unexpected delays in Boxster deliveries to our board
participants who signed up to attend, the criteria of driving a Boxster
has been removed.

It was decided meeting the board names in person was more important than
having the gathering/convoy consist of Boxsters only. So those of you
who weren't receiving your Boxster in time might want to consider coming
in your present wheels. Mark Christenson, you were always an exception
because of your site! PP, you surely know you are welcome, but you're
going to the Rebellion event, right?

Attendees, don't delay too long on the Imperial Palace room
reservations. Any held rooms not reserved are released March 16; it is
first come, first served. See Update #2 for reservation info, but refer
to Porsche Club, Boxster gathering.
