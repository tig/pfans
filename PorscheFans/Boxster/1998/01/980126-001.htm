I've been looking for some racing compound brake pads for my Boxster for
a while (6 months) with no luck, but just got a call back from Paragon
Products that he had pads coming in this week. They're  Pagid "orange"
pads. I've never run Pagid racing pads before and am looking for info on
experience with them. I'd previously used the CoolCarbon pads on the 944
Turbo I use to track, but I understand these pads are no longer
available. The Pagids definitly are not cheap (neither were the CC's)
at$185/front set and $155/rear set for my car. Jason's offered to throw
in a quart of ATE Super brake fluid with the full set. I've got them on
order, but would like to know if anyone knows of any other high
performance alternatives for the Boxster and general issues with the
Pagid orange compounds in general. My car gets tracked hard at PCA
Drivers ed and time trials every month. The stock brakes and pads have
been great, but looking for that little extra to help keep reeling in
modified 911's!
