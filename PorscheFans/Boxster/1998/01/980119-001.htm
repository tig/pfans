First of all thank you to everyone who responded on my question about the
full-leather option on the Boxster.  I'll try to hunt some cars down to
actually look at the difference.  Since I'm planning to order an arena red
car w/tan interior it seems like the reflection issue may be real - its
just a question of how bad it is.

Extended Warranty Option?

My follow-up question is: How many of you have chosen the 5 year extended
warranty option on the Boxster?  I don't have the papers in front of me but
I think its around $2300.  My hope was since I'm jumping in a year after
the Boxster's introduction that Porsche would have worked out the bugs by
now and the probability of problems would be lower - but perhaps some
people with longer experience with Porsche can comment here.  Would the
Extended warranty be a good idea??  

Thanks in advance,

Brian.
