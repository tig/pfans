Eric, Pfans,

The short answer to your questions is that a Boxster will corner faster than a 911 in a 
low speed (e.g. city corner) all things (particularly driver skill, tires etc.) being 
equal.  However, the Boxster will not give you the same visceral sensation that the 911 
does.

I am writing this from the perspective of having taken both my Boxster and my '76 911 on 
 race tracks, autocross (and obviously the street).  On the track, my Boxster with very 
good street tires let me catch up to much more powerfull 911s (read turbos) with race 
tires, in the corners, even though they were faster than me on the long straights.  I 
came out of the corners so much faster, after a while, they couldn't even catch me in 
the straights.

In general, the most important things that determine how fast a car will go through any 
given corner ( in roghly decreasing order of importance) are: 
the driver's skill
the tires
the weight of the vehicle
the wheel geometry
the fore-aft weight distribution
the spring and sway bar rates
the center of gravity

Porsche 911s and Boxsters are blessed with a relatively low center of gravity due to 
their unique, horizontally opposed, engines, that permits all of the engine weight to be 
concentrated in only a few inches, and those few inches are mounted at the bottom of the 
body instead of in the middle, like most cars.  The low center of gravity makes the cars 
roll (lean) less than other cars with comparable weight, spring rate, sway-bar spring 
rate, etc.

However, at 2,700 to 3,000 pounds, the Porsches are not light, compared to the likes of 
Miatas or Civics (one of which turned in the fastest time of day, on racing slicks, in 
the last SCCA autocross I partcipated in).

911s also have an unusal fore-aft weight distribution, with 60% of the weight carried by 
the rear wheels.  This puts the pivot center in a turn (the point about which the body 
rotates) just behind the front wheels.  So in a sharp turn, the front wheels stick, and 
the rear wheels slide, which tends to push the driver & passenger back into their seats 
(somewhat like the carnival ride, the whip).  This creates a very secure sensation of 
speed with control, which I happen to like very much.  But the truth is, you can get 
through the turn much faster, and come out at a higher speed, with a Boxster, which has 
its weight distribution balanced. (close to 50% over each axle).  The Boxster, by the 
way has less of a tendancy to make the rear wheels slide (sliding wheels reduce a 
vehicles speed).

Polar moments (911s is very high, Boxster's is low) contributes to the speed with which 
a car begins to rotate after the wheel is turned.

Sorry for the excessive bandwidth, just wanted to convey that your question requires a 
very complex answer (this answer only scratches the surface).  There are some very good 
books out there that explain a lot more than I have.
