i dont know the particulars of the mity mite... but i have had just such a
problem w/ my boxster. just w/ the boxster this problem is a bit worse... when
the battery goes dead the central locking system disallows you to unlock the
trunk so you cant get at the battery to charge it... this lead to me having the
car towed to the service center to be opened and charged... quite pathetic i
know... the solution tho is a trickle charger that porsche sells thru its parts
dept's... called charge-o-matic

or so it was called... its a novel little device.... when the cars in the
garage simply plug the corded plug into the cigarette lighter and the other end
goes into the wall outlet... and this thing monitors your charge.. when it
falls under full charge it charges it up to full again... its a trickle charges
the battery so it does it nice and slow( low amperage ) and its nice and
neat... has a little light on the wallunit end that turns on red when its
charging

cost is about 70bux and its a life saver... had i known what i know now about
it... i would have gotten the charger and tried to forego the tow and trip to
service... this thing would probably bring the battery back to full if left
long enuff... or at least would have built up enuff of a charge for me to
unlock the front hood and hook up a battery reconditioner to recharge the
battery.

just my $0.02
keep the change... :)
