Hi P-fans,
I was at work today and one of my co-workers who has the luxury of =
coming in at 12pm told me that Speedvision featured a ducumentary on =
Porsche from the first car produced to present day.  Yeah...that's right =
I'm sitting at work at a computer terminal while a show on mine and your =
favorite car was on.....aaaargh!    I missed it. =20
My point to all this is that, I was wondering if anyone got a copy of =
this on video tape that would be willing to dub a copy for me.  I'm =
willing to pay a fee (obiously to outrageous).  I'll pay for the =
shipping involved. =20
So if you were lucky enough to get a copy and can help me on my quest =
please e-mail me.
Thanks again
Happy Porsche-ing

Hello all,
Does anyone know how much the hardtop will cost if purchased after delivery?
I imagine it will be somewhat more than the cost if purchased at the time of
ordering but I don't know how much more??  And what, if any, modifications
need to be made to the car in order to attach it?

Brian, I am also concerned about getting the 4 yr warranty on my boxster, due
to be delivered in May.  I placed my order yesterday and basically insisted to
the salesman that if Iam going to recieve the car in My I want the 4 year
warranty.  He told me the 4 year warranty only applies to the '99 model.  Can
anyone confirm this? In any case he was unsure whether my car will be a '98 or
'99 model since it is near the cutoff, or so he says; but he assured me that
if porsche will not give me the additional two years his dealership will.  So
whatever that's worth....
