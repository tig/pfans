i wanna see a show of hands of how many ppl think i was pitching products?

im just trying to get a tread going on car care for our beauties...

not like were talking about anthing AT ALL in this damn list... look at the
911, 356, and 924/944 lists... EVERY day... like 45 msgs AT LEAST... and ppl
are actually discussing stuff not like here where some bozo every day asks if
he should buy a Z3 over the Boxster or a Vette or another moron who wants to
know if he should wait for the Boxster S... and then theres the nimrods who
have bought Boxsters and are trying to sell em here... 

Well Excuse me... but thats not the point of such a list... granted we dont
have as much material to go on like the 911 folks yet... not much repairing to
be done by our own hands yet... give us a couple of years.. so why not talk
about caring for our cars... or maybe a story of a really good ride you had...
this channel is about sharing... get it?

i know we've had ppl selling crap here b4... i know ive seen it too often
myself... but how am i selling something i didnt give and URL or even a phone
number where to buy from me... had i been selling that is... I dont sell... I
wanna get into it... but Im not selling yet...

maybe 6 months down the road youll see solicitation from me... but I havent
solicited yet...

Car Care for a lot of first time sports/luxury car owners and first time
detailers alike is a tough issue... there is lots to know... EXCUUUUUUUSE me
for being a good samaritan.

I personally dont know one person who hasnt read the Owner's Manual on the
subject of waterproofing the top and gone to their dealer and been like "why do
they tell me your supposed to have it then quit carrying it?"

I was one of these ppl too... till I found out the BMW product is the same
thing... then went to BMW and they were always sold out... so when I saw it...
I suggest you all follow that example... this product is pretty scarce these
days.

There I've spoken my peice... 

By all means reply and comment on it... but dont be an IDIOT and tell me I'm
pitching product.
