I chose full leather because I enjoy the look,feel and smell of leather.  I 
thought the car was too expensive to have a plastic/ vinyl interior.  I plan 
on keeping the car a long time and was concerened about how the leather would 
wear over time.

After much consideration I came to the conclusion that leather was the only 
way to go. The standard seats in the Boxster look fine, leather seating 
surface and vinyl sides and back.  What I did not like were the "pebbled 
vinyl" door panels and dash.  Looked cheap compared to the vinyl in my 85 
Prelude and my wife's 89 Legend.  This is only my opinion, others may like it.

The Legend has leather seats and door panels.  The door panels and rear seats 
look like new.  The front seats (seating surfaces) look a little aged but 
certainly do not need replacing.  So I figured that the seats in the standard 
Boxster interior and the leather interior would wear the same and the only 
issue was the non-seating surfaces.  Since the non-seating surfaces have worn 
well in the Legend (look like new) I see no reason why they should not wear 
well in the Boxster.  I believe that over time, the aged leather gives the car 
a bit of character.

Certainly leather is nice option, but is it needed? no.  
Does the car look good in standard dress? yes.
Is the standard seat comfortable? yes.
Since the Boxster's base price is literally base auto, the option list grows
rapidly.  I choose other items that had more benefit for the cost.
But, like we all say, its a very personal decision.  Each and every item.
Side note, despite all the research and planning I did before hand, it still
took me 3 hours to finalize my order the day it was due!
Good Luck!
