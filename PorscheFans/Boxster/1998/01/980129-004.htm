as far as the tip is concerned... i have it in mine and im very happy w/ it

i know that there is the desire to have a stick in such an asskicker of a car
but i live in NYC... and more time in the car will be spent in rush hour
traffic than flying down the highways...

figured id be nice to my left thigh.. my girlfriend might still need its use
now and again.

:)

as far as the tip is concerned it rocks..
but i havent gotten to put it to the test that much yet... cuz even tho my baby
is 6 months old already... its still got very low mileage.. like under 500

which echo's to... its still not broken in so i cant be going for world bug
killing records...
:)

also the nice thing about the tip is the shifter... its soo gorgeous... its
definitely a centerpiece... its soo different
