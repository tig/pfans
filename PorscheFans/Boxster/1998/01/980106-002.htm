I can't post to your Pfans list, but I thought you might want to mention this to its readers:

I was at Beverly Hills Porsche the other day (no, can't afford Porsche, looking at used BMWs) and they had quite a few Boxsters on the forecourt.  As I walked by one of them on my way out, I noticed that the deck badge said "Boxster S."  And it looked like a real genuine Porsche badge.  I also saw that there was a Texas inspection decal on the windshield, so I guess it was being sold as used.

My .02:   I don't think a separate lock would make a significant improvement.
The console plastic is so flimsy that I believe one could easily pry it off
and break it should a thief want access.  I guess this--like the rest of the
plastic interior--is one way to keep the price reasonable...relatively
speaking.
