Brian, the full leather package in the car your ordering is great! One
of my partners has that combination and it's the best looking Boxster
I've seen yet, period. (Also has white gauge faces, silver roll bar and
brushed stainless (?) on the handbrake and shift knob along with the
leather).I've been in the car several times and have noticed no glare
problems. I have the standard partial leather interior in my Boxster
(Speed Yellow) and I have no complaints or problems with it at all, but
it's black and I don't think the leather option in black would be as
striking as it is in other colors. As far as showing it's age - leather
definitly requires extra care to keep looking new through the years. I
agree with the comment someone made about the leather seats in a 928
being the only thing that looked old, a friend of mines 928 was the same
- but he notoriously does NOT take care of things very well. I have a
'74 911 Carrera with full leather (black with tan). The seats had
considerable wear after only 80,000 miles but that was over 15 years
when I had them recovered - but the rest of the leather interior is
still in great shape (now at 24+years!)
