More news on the new 4 Year Warranty.  

I called Porsche and spoke with one of their customer service
representatives in Reno. It turns out the Porsche phases in production of
the 1999 model year for the Boxster starting around May 1st.  This is the
start of production, and the first cars start rolling off the production
line around the second week of June.  This is important to me because I'd
rather not get the last product from the 1998 model year, before any
improvements that are made as part of the standard improvement cycle.
Also, Porsche is adding a 4 year standard warranty to the Boxster with the
1999 model year - up from 2 years.  Currently the optional 5 year warranty
goes for about $2000, so effectively they are discounting the car by almost
that amount (well, you know what I mean) - at least this is the case if
they don't increase the price for the 1999 models.

I've got the dealer checking into getting one of the first deliveries of
the 1999 Boxster in Mid-June (European Delivery) and hope to hear more in
the next few days.

My understanding is the US-bound cars (1999 Model Year) start showing up in
dealers in the August/September timeframe.

ps. still "stuck" on the choice of full leather or not.  Right now I'm
planning for an Arena red car with Tan (Full leather) or Black (partial
leather).  Thanks for the input everyone!

Brian.
