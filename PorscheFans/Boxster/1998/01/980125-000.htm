James:

Just as there are 914/6s running around with air-cooled 3.5-liter
twin-plug turbo motors, I'm sure that someone will eventually do a
Boxster with a water-cooled 996-or-later turbo motor (and it'll
probably have the same expensive-to-deal-with problems as the 914
turbos do).

As I'm sure you know, though, engine output isn't the only reason for
the 911 twin-turbo's prodigious performance.  The four-wheel drive,
aerodynamics, brakes, etc., are just as important.

Also... As the owner of a so-called "914" that's actually more 911 
than 914, I can tell you that it'll probably cost more to put all the 
911 parts in your Boxster than it would cost to just BUY a 911.
