Just e-mailed Porsche Pete about the problem and he was gratious enough
to get back to me immeditely,  He says that he has the same problem and
thinks it's with his server.  He's looking into it.  I guess in the
meantime, we just try to be patient.  Something we have learned to do
all too well over the past several months.  Pat

To all,

I haven't had a chance to post to the list in several months, but you can
advertise Porsches and Porsche related items (parts, literature, wanted, etc)
in PML for free. Our magazine comes out monthly and goes to a very targeted P-
car audience. Ads need to be to us by Jan 25th to be in the Feb issue which
will mail around the 10th of Feb. You can email them.

Thanks and regards,

Phil Van Buskirk, PMLetter@aol.com
