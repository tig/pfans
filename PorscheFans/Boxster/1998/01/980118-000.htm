Brian,

Thought I'd drop over from the 928 group - that is about as unbiased as you
can get. So here is my 0.02 worth. 

IMHO leather is not the best material for the job, so don't buy it. If the
engineers at Porsche were in control it would not be an option at all.

Some car makers like Jaguar have based their trade on a 'dress code' of
sorts that conveyed a certain image to their cients. This code included wood
and leather and was the Euro analogue of the American chrome, tailfins and
bulk. People in the know thought it was a great joke, people not in the know
were actually impressed. So if your out to impress, choose your mark.

Leather is not the lightest material, it is not the most comfortable and it
is not the most durable. It simply does not have any advantages at all over
the synthetic alternatives but does have disadvantages. Dare I say it is not
Porsche, it is not the best. 

The sales and marketing people will sell you anything, they would like to
buy a Boxter too.
 
If you want to keep dash reflection off your windscreen choose a dark dash
colour.

If you think leather looks expensive go have a look at some 928 leather, it
is often the only thing that makes these cars look old, it does not look
good or expensive, just bad. Now imagine if the 928 was an open car...

best to you and the new Boxter

From: brianc@infomaniac.com (Brian Chiko)
Subject: Full Leather or Partial Leather - That is the Question

I'm going though the process of ordering a new Boxter right now and need
some feedback from unbiased (well... as unbiased as is possible on a
Boxster board:-) on whether the full Leather option is worthwhile or not.
The salesman (as salesmen will have a tendancy to do) is trying to upsell
me to a leather interior - commenting on the shine of the dashboard if not
leather, and the overall "cheap" appearance of the regular dashboard.  I'd
like to get your opinion as to whether this is a worthwhile option - please
also let me know whether you own the Full Leather Option, or the standard,
partial leather option.

Many thanks,

Brian.
