Folks,
I do want to apologize for what looks like a spam from GT Racing
products pointing folks to the new web site.  Apparently there is a bug
in the list server and the message just wont die - it was sent once but
the list server keeps delivering it.  I've been debugging it since the
ListMaster doesn't seem to be reading his email.  To prove its not just
overzealous marketing types (!), take a look at the headers in the
emails.  They are all EXACTLY the same and the time is the same as the
one, single, (as in not multiple) original email that was sent to the
list.

You can see them by accessing the archive for Jan 19th at
http://www.porschefans.com.  Again, sorry for this.  I did it but I'M
NOT GUILTY!!!

PS - Yes, I know I misspelled Boxster as many of you have all pointed
out and it will NEVER happen again :)
