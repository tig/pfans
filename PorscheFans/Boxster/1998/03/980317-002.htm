Hi P-fans
I just wanted to let everyone know that I have found an excellent =
Porsche parts distibutor that deals wit the public for new and used =
Porsche parts.  He is very honest and can locate pretty well anything.  =
He will even install the parts in your car if your close by and can get =
your car there.  As for being reputable, All the Porsche dealers and =
shops in the Toronto area and a lot across Canada call him for parts =
that are hard to find. =20
As for personal testimonial, I have a 73 911 in which I bent some =
valves.  I ended up taking the car to a so-called reputable shop in the =
Toronto Area and was taken for a ride for $1000.00 for no work done.  =
Just an inspection.  I was quite disappointed.  That's when I called =
"Whaletail Productions" and spoke to the owner Randy Meyer.  He =
explained what I had to do to deal with my situation, then picked up my =
car in Toronto and brought it out to Waterloo (His location) where he =
found me a new motor, installed it and then returned the car to me.  He =
has since helped me out in finding many parts and advised me on the best =
course of action regarding maintenance and repairs.  He is one of those =
people who believes in helping people for the sake of helping and not to =
always "turn a buck"  I highly recommend Whaletail Productions for parts =
you may need.  I have listed the  phone numbers below.
