My '88 Carrera did dozens of Drivers Education events in the Southeast (Road
Atlanta, Sebring, Moroso, Roebling, etc.)  It was a well cared for (sometimes
expensively so), relatively unmodified Carrera.
When I traded for something else it was pretty but flogged.  I knew all the
beatings it took, all the fixed welds, the pylon hit repairs, and miles driven
at flat out pedal to the metal.  {no off road excursions, BTW}
It was fun, somewhere in my subconscious, to participate at closed course
events like this, then drive the darling home on the Interstate with the
Winnebagos and Caravans.  Kind of a devil in disguise with cruise control.

At the same time, after assessing the broad differential between a street
version Porsche and 'real' race car ones, it became evident -to me- I was just
a closet racer beating my luxurious (sic expensive) wanabee into submission.
Aside from learning the performance envelope of my Carrera I didn't come away
with any great benefit.  If I was serious about being a race car driver it
would take much more than occasional weekend jaunts in run groups, and a whole
lot more car than a box stock 1988 Carrera.

My neighbor, with the tricked out Camaro RS (pulling about 375 h.p. on the
dyno), thinks it's real great stuff to burn rubber through three gears.  When
I take him out in his car and attain his personal terminal velocity, then take
a TURN... he has a heart attack.  [I've learned to do this in left turns so
they can't reach over and grab the wheel.]
That we survived the four wheel drift, didn't bang his car up, and actually
came out of the turn accelerating under control amazed him.  He also realized
he was just a punk kid making noise before, not really DRIVING his car.
{So now he wants to do a Drivers Ed event!}

I sold my Boxster because it was time.  I could come away with the experience
of owning and driving it for a year, and get all my money back.  It was math,
not problems with the car.
It is a great car, and I'm going to get a second one.  
If I want to race, I'll buy a race car.
If I want more horsepower I'll get it now instead of waiting for the factory
to come up with their added value version (sic $$$).
