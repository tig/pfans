Geneva Coverage..excerpt from Autoweek

Every major auto show has its personality: Tokyo technology,
Detroit grandeur, Frankfurt immensity. Part of each show's
personality is defined by the self-centered focus of the products
debuted and displayed. Call it a Darwinian ethnocentrism. 

Except at Geneva. In Switzerland, there is no home-court
advantage, and the only ones trying to outdo each other are
craftsmen whose creations stand on their own merits, or are
worthy aftermarket modifications that we can only hope will
make it to these shores. 

What cars showed up that we should care about? Porsche
unveiled its latest iteration of the new 911, a cabriolet with lines
so beautiful it'll suck your breath away. BMW debuted its
entry-level 3 Series, a car whose significance is not lost on the
market, or the company. Volkswagen again made news, not with
its New Beetle-conspicuous by its absence-but with a cabrio
version of its W12 from Tokyo last fall. For flag-waving
'mericans, Chrysler's Pronto Cruizer showed what can be done
when a '37 Roadster is repenned in '98. 

Rolls-Royce unveiled its Silver Seraph, only the ninth new Rolls
in the company's 92-year history. Ford chose to debut the Escort
replacement, a car whose brand/nameplate/owners will know it
as the Focus. Then there was Jaguar's supercharged XKR,
Ferrari's ever more expensive 456M (should the M designate
Money?) and a pair of Mercedes-Benzes: the 500E replacement,
the E55, shown in ''leisurely'' station wagon configuration, and
the CLK cabrio, a car whose real talents will shine come
summer. 

And this being Geneva, whose personality really is one that's
open to the world and accepting of all comers, we would be
remiss if we didn't mention the latest from India's Tata
Engineering & Locomotive Co., the Tata Safari sport/utility
vehicle. 

Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet 

In lo these last 50 years, Porsche has sold more than 250,000
convertibles, which, for perspective, is fewer than the number of
Escorts Ford sold last year in the United States. But if Porsche
convertibles are a slightly less rare sight on the road than they
used to be, they're about to become an even more welcome one.
Porsche unveiled what it calls its best convertible ever, the
all-new 911 Carrera Cabriolet. Who could argue? Not us. That's
why it's the AutoWeek Editors' Choice award winner for Best in
Show at Geneva. It's faster than the model it replaces (for more
details, see page 17), safer, and only marginally more expensive,
going on sale in Germany this spring for about $87,000. Like
many other European cars, the 911 Cabrio will cost less than in
the United States, Porsche's largest market for the car. The 911
Carrera Coupe goes on sale in the States in April, with the
Cabrio coming later in the year. 

Concealed behind the new cabrio's rear seats are two
high-strength steel roll bars that pop up automatically to provide
protection if angle sensors determine that the car is in a
precarious position. Porsche claims it's first to offer side airbags
(door-mounted) which protect the front occupants' heads and
bodies, even if the top and windows are fully retracted. Two
other notable features: Porsche will include, as standard
equipment (in Europe at least, with a U.S. decision to come) a
71-pound, two-shell aluminum hardtop with a heated glass
backlight; and a remote button on the key fob will open or close
the ragtop. So if a rain shower happens upon you while you're
enjoying that cappuccino, don't get up. Just point and click.
