Well first of all, you are asking the Boxster List for advice, so I
think most responses here will favor the Boxster (likewise, if you post
the same question on the BMW Message Board you will hear favoritism for
the M Roadster).

Secondly, all the comparison tests that I have seen have favored the
Boxster as their bottom line choice. If I had to decide, I too would
also choose the Boxster over the M Roadster. Here's why:

- A Boxster is a Porsche. This is really subjective, but I believe all
Porsches are special, whereas only some BMWs (M-Sport) are special.
While the M Roadster may be a limited edition run (as all M-Sport cars
are) its still a very upright positioned car compared with the Boxster's
sports car look and feel.

- The Boxster's appeal is its blend of power and handling as a quality
package. The M Roadster may have more engine power but road testers have
described the overall effect as something less than the ultimate driving
machine.

- Porsche knows when to use chrome and how much. Yes, chromeaholics will
love the new M Roadster but the rest of us say "enough is enough!"
already. Chrome can be a nice accent when used in good taste, but I
think BMW has exceeded that exception with the chome-a-matic design
choices in the M Roadster.

If its power you are worried about with the Boxster (first: have you
driven one yet? Decide for yourself how much power is enough or not;
everyone has different expectations of "how much is enough") you can
upgrade the engine through several aftermarket solutions currently
available ... or put down a deposit and wait for the Boxster S model
(though this will run more $$$).

As with any of my advice, I strongly recommend taking test drives of
your prospective vehicles so that you can decide for yourself -- all
this ASCII talk is subjectively speculative. This may be difficult to do
with such in-demand models but give it a shot before deciding.
