i have stock carbon fibre... currently have the Carbon/leather steering
wheel... and the heating controls/radio... cuz the shifters for my tip were not
available at the time i took delivery... but now seeing them im leaving them be
probabaly... but i do have my Dashboard dial fascia in carbon fibre on order...
as well as the heating vent oval's trim...

as to whether to get the Porsche product or the aftermarket ones... here's my
take on it...
the Porsche Part a) looks better... b) will fit better ... c) costs a lot more
for good reason

for example... you can pick up an aftermarket Carbon-fiber-LOOK kit... for the
entire car... like 21 pieces... for 500bux

the steering wheel in carbon/leather alone costed me 1600... after the fact
costs something like 2000-2500

the heating vent/radio costed 700something... after the fact costs like 850

the shifter and handbrake was supposed to be 700and change... after costs
800something

the dashboard fascia was NOT available when i got my baby... which was august
97 delivery from a june 97 build ... it became available in november i believe
at the earliest... cost is 2800
and well worth it for the look

the other item im trying to get is the trim line that splits the
dashboard...but noone seems to know how to get it... or what is the part number
