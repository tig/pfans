993 = air-cooled
986 = water-cooled

Since the 986 was designed to be water-cooled, I seriously doubt that you
could put an air-cooled engine in, even with extensive modifications.  The
side air intakes are just not going to provide as much airflow.  But if you
do go ahead and do it, I'd love to be behind you when your 993 engine
fries!  : )
