Brian,

I'm contemplating the purchase of a Boxster -- probably pre-owned, as the
Jaguar folks like to say -- and I was intrigued by your email to the list
in which you compare the reliability of German cars to Japanese cars.

I have owned all manner of cars from both countries. Four of them were
BMWs. I am an enthusiastic driver (I raced in my native England and rallied
here in Canada) and I marvelled at the perforamnce and balance of the
Bimmers.  But reliable they were not.  I had a 1990 535 that had pistons,
clutch, flywheel, and diff replaced within the first year, all on seperate
occasions. Everything was covered by the warranty, but the inconvenience of
shlepping the car to the dealer every other week , or so it seemed, was
maddening.

Interestingly, the most reliable car I have owned (and still own) is a 1991
Mazda Miata. The car is supercharged and modified in other respects. And it
is extraordinarily dependable. Two years ago I drove it from Toronto to
Vancouver Island via the northern states.  Last year I drove it back.  On
the interstates the car was cruising hours on end at between 150 and 170
Km/h. In Montana, which nominally has no daytime speed limit, I had the car
up to an indicated 220 Km/h (I'm not exagerating) for about 10 minutes. The
significance of all this is that the car did not miss a beat, despite being
driven hard. In its entire seven-years it has never developed a problem.
Not a single one. ANd this is a car that costs, today, about Can$30K,
compared with a base Boxster which is listed at Can$58,400.

Which means that for twice the amount of money, I can buy a car that has
the same number of seats and expect it to have far more problems. To the
rational mind, that makes no sense. But, of course, car enthusiasts are
seldom rational. And we're talking about the Boxster, which real men (and
women) know is a thing of beauty to drive and behold.

So I will buy one, reliability be damned.

John B.
