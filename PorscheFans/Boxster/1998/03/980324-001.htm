(Ok - one last bit of info on quality and I'll drop this (but I'd love 
to hear pros and cons from other people)...

Leo,

Here (scoll down) is the most recent Initial quality survey in which
Porsche ranked in the top 10 (at least that I could find). It seems to
support the idea that sports cars don't need to be unreliable - in fact
Leo, surprisingly you would be better off driving an NSX than a Toyota 
Corrola to work
every day if reliability was your only concern - I find this truly 
amazing that a sports car can be as reliable as a luxury car like the 
Lexus.  I know I'll love my new Porsche Boxster but just think that it 
shouldn't have to be a painful love!  

For the 1997 report (where Porsche isn't listed) see:

http://www.jdpower.com/releases/70430car.html

In the 1997 report it notes that the average number of defects for all 
cars
surveyed was 86 defects per 100 cars, and this compares to 174 defects 
per
hundred cars reported in the Porsche Boxster initial quality survey.  I
suspect that this is a dirty little secret that Porsche would like to 
avoid
(but I'm hoping that they'll just focus on fixing the problem ASAP for 
my
99' delivery :-).

Boxster

J.D. Power and Associates Releases
Annual Vehicle Dependability Study 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: March 19, 1996 

AGOURA HILLS, CALIFORNIA--The Lexus LS 400 and
Acura NSX tie as the most dependable car at five years of
ownership according to the 1996 J.D. Power and Associates
Vehicle Dependability Study. On the light truck side, the Toyota
Pickup and the Dodge Ram 50 also tie for top honors. This
dependability was measured from surveys returned by more than
33,000 car and truck owners who rated their 1991 vehicles across
89 problem categories based on their last 12 months of ownership.

The following is a list, in rank order, of the top cars after five years
of ownership as reported in the J.D. Power and Associates Vehicle
Dependability Study: 

     Acura NSX * 
     Lexus LS 400 * 
     Infiniti Q45 
     Mercedes-Benz 300 Series 
     Mercedes-Benz 300SL/500SL 
     Cadillac Eldorado 
     Toyota Cressida 
     Buick Century 
     Cadillac Brougham 
     Porsche 911 

(* Tied for Best Model in Vehicle Dependability) 

The following light truck models head each of the six segments
featured in the study: 

     Truck Segment 1991 Model-Year Vehicle 
     Compact Pickup Dodge Ram 50 * 
     Toyota Pickup * 
     Full-Size Pickup:  Chevrolet C/K Pickup 
     Compact Sport Utility:  Nissan Pathfinder 
     Full-Size Van:  Chevrolet Van/Sport Van 
     Compact Van:  Toyota Previa 
     Full-Size Sport Utility:  Toyota Land Cruiser 

(* Tied for Best Truck Model in Vehicle Dependability) 

With new vehicle prices at a premium and an influx of cars coming
off lease, used cars are more attractive than ever. After five years
of ownership, 1991 model-year vehicles are prime candidates for
this used car market. 

One of the main questions that plague a new-car buyer is whether
their car will hold up over the long run-which cars will still be in
good condition by the time they pay off their loan? "If you're
looking at vehicles that are four to five years old, the Vehicle
Dependability Study is an excellent gauge to determine which
vehicles will have the least problems. This study is particularly
valuable because it measures the number of problems experienced
by original owners," commented Bill Wallis, Senior Account
Executive at J.D. Power and Associates. 

Obviously the current manufacturer focus on vehicle options, and
ABS in particular, is a worthy pursuit. The Vehicle Dependability
Study reveals that close to 60 percent of consumers with ABS said
they want their next vehicle equipped with this system. The
implication is that safety continues to be a key consumer issue.
Despite concern in the industry that anti-lock brakes have more
problems than traditional brakes, car owners of vehicles with ABS
are more satisfied with their brakes and report fewer brake
problems than those without. (Of the top ten car models, all, with
the exception of the Buick Century came equipped with ABS.) 

The focus of the J.D. Power and Associates Vehicle Dependability
Study is the past-year problem experience of owners who
bought a new personal-use vehicle during the 1991 model year and
have retained it. The study looks at durability of specific items,
incidence of warranty work, rating of work performed and the
amount spent in the past year on non-routine repairs. In addition,
the study addresses a wide variety of manufacturer and dealer
issues as well as information of value to manufacturer engineers and
product designers.

behavior. The firm conducts syndicated and proprietary studies in
