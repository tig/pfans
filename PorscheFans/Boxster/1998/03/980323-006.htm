Brian,

I don't really understand your point of posting an e-mail flaming =
quality of European cars on the Boxster Mailing list.
But let me make couple of points here. First of all with regard to your =
discussion about "1.0 release", I had my Boxster
since  March of last year, and while I admit I had to take car to the =
dealer to fix couple minor problems, it is well=20
compensated by the fact, that I ALREADY have this car for over a year =
and drive it every day. There is no way I would
delay getting this car by two years, just because it might be more =
reliable some distant time in the future. As far as longer
warranty goes, for the amount of money your are going to spent on your =
99 car vs. mine 97 I could get extended warranty for
ten years.
Now, as far as defects/vehicle statistic goes. Let me offer you another =
point of you on this. First of all I assume that=20
JD Powers quality report applies mostly to American car market. Now =
think about level of complexity of Japanese vs.
European cars shipped  to US. While most of Japanese cars are =
"econoboxes" most of the European cars except VW
(no offence to VW owners here. It is a fine car) are luxury automobiles. =
And all luxury cars have tones of gadgets/features, and more =
sophisticated technology inside/outside. So, my point is, that if you =
add level of car complexity to defects/vehicle
equation, and make it look more like  defects/part equation, you'll get =
somewhat different statistic.=20
So if one looks for the reliable mean of transportation I would =
definitely recommend Toyota Corolla and not Boxster

Leo
