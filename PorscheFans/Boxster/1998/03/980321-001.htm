I just found some good web pages with summaries by JD Powers and associates
of the problems that 911 owners have had with their cars.  These are for
the 1997 911s - after a lot of years of perfecting the manufacturing.  I
suspect that the Boxsters also reported on were the first production units
- from Zufenhausen, not Valmet.  I have to believe that it is probably
going to be a while before the Boxsters in Valmet get as good as this (but
only the JD Powers reports in 99 and 2000 will tell us the truth).
Amazingly 60% plus had problems - I hope that Porsche is moving some of
those Lean production experts up to Valmet for the 99 year model builds.
