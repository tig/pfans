Here's a funny joke from one of my salesmen.

     A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a 
     mud hole and is sinking.  He calls to the chicken to go and get the 
     farmer to help pull him out to safety.  The chicken runs to find the 
     farmer but the farmer can't be found.  So he drives the farmer's 
     Porsche back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the
     bumper.  He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the 
     horse and drives forward saving him from sinking.
     
     A few days later, the chicken and the horse were again playing in the 
     meadow when the chicken fell into the mud hole.  The chicken yelled 
     for the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, 
     "I think I can stand over the hole!" So he stretched over the width of 
     the hole and said, "Grab onto my 'thingy' and pull yourself
     up."  The chicken did and pulled herself to safety.
     
     The moral of the story:
     If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a Porsche to pick up 
     chicks.
