<< Thanks for responding to my earlier post on the Boxster board. What brand
 of 8 inch woofers did you put in the doors and do they fit without external
 alteration?>>

I have not responded to your e-mail as I was away skiing; sorry for the delay.

I put MB Quart speakers in the dash and doors for $750.  The doors needed no
mod.  NOTE that I did not order the upgraded Porsche speaker system.  The door
panels are different.  The standard door panel is flat and can accommodate a
greater radius speaker; the upgraded doors bulge inwards and can go only up to
a 6 or 6.25" speaker.  My shop has worked on both sets of door panels.
However, if you have the upgraded door panels, I know that Rodeo Audio in
Beverly Hills was able to put subs into those panels.  

<< Also how much power do the speakers need what brand and size of amp did you
use?>>  

For now I have a single two channel Acoustic amp at 110w/ch 2 @ 4ohms.  It
sounds OK but some more power would be nice.  The Acoustic is a good but not
great amp.  It doesn't have MOSFET construction but it cost only $175.  You
get what you pay for.  Later this spring I anticipate upgrading to a 4 channel
amp with 110w/ch (i.e., PPI 4100).

<<How does it sound with your upgrade and was it  worth it? Thanks for the
information?>>

I had the basic Porsche system: cassette head and dash speaker which consisted
only of the 4" and NO tweeters!!!!!!!!!  ANYTHING would be an improvement.
Yes, it was worth it at $1600.  

The upper mids and highs sound a bit harsh.  The harshness may be due to the
reflection of the glass windshield and having a power amp that is not high end
and lacking in power.  I improved the harshness but decreased the perception
of spaciousness and separation by having the shop move the tweeters to the
kick panels.  I may have them move the 4" dash to the kicks panels as well.   

The 8" speakers provide good bass; it would be better to have enclosures built
into the doors to further define the bass ($500).  A subwoofer can be added to
the passenger kick panel (with some compromise in passenger leg room) for
about $750 utilizing a JL Audio sub (6 or 8", I forgot) in a custom built
fiberglass enclosure.

I will add rear 6" and tweeters to the storage bin below the rollbars; I don't
use the space at all.  I think this will fill out the sound and remove or
distract my ears from the mild harshness up front.

My dash is an Alpine CD with options for a CD changer; Alpine makes a 12 disc
changer.  That is my last concern.

Good luck and let me know how your sound quest goes, OK?
