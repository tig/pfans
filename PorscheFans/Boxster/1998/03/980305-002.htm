Pfans,

Well I guess it was my turn.  I left my baby Boxster in the garage for a week while I 
went & partied at Mardi Gras.  Upon my return, my first clue of a problem was that 
the remote lock would not accept my order to open.  After manually opening the door I 
found everything dead, and of course the front hood release was inoperative.  I 
managed to get baby operational again without major surgery (in the left front 
wheel-well) towing to the dealer, or other major headaches, and learned something 
about the system (at least the one with remote locking) in the process.

Here's what I learned:

The front hood release is mechanical, cable controlled system, that has a solenoid 
that locks the release under certain circumstances (e.g. the car is in locked mode, 
or the battery dies).  I suspect there is some sort of deadfall system that automatic 
ally locks when the battery dies (perhaps the solenoid is constantly energized to 
work against a spring, which would add to the rate of battery drain.  Not the way I 
would design the system.

To get it rolling, I charged up the battery using a jury-rig to the cigarette lighter 
socket.  Once there was sufficient charge for the computer and other systems to work 
(but not enought to charge), as evidenced by the dashboard security LED flashing in 
response to the key-switch presses, I attempted to open the front hood -- no soap.  
So in a moment of inspiration, and luck, I closed the doors, and cycled the lock 
through a lock-unlock cycle, and now the front trunk release was operational.  I 
could then charge up the battery.

Lessons learned.  If you are going to leave your 986 unused for a week or more, make 
certain the battery is fully charged at the beginning of that period.  Keep a lighter 
socket-to-lighter socket charger handy (but not in the Boxster's trunk).  Good luck!!

P.S.  Before I saw the Automotion $200+ Sling solution to warm-weather storage of the 
Boxster hardtop, I created my own identical-looking solution with about $30 of 
material from the hardware store (and little more assembly and installation than 
required by Automotion).  I like Automotion, but do not consider myself a charity for 
their benefit.  Give us PGuys-n-Gals a break hugh?
