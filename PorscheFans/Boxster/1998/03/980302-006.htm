--Elaine,
  I happen to be a valet parker and very judgmental at it :)  BUT you 
are forcing me to break my Numero Uno sin in my automobile religion and 
that sin is to compare two German vehicles.  That is a no-no :O  German 
vs Japanese, American...that's fine.  Anyway, but when it comes  to 
Porsche get out of my way because German cars are the best built cars 
ever and the best German car line ever constructed is none other than 
PORSCHE AG!!!  Baby!!   Sorry, lost it there.  Anyway, don't get me 
wrong, Bayerische Motoren Werke are second to Porsche, but go with the 
Boxster because #1 'Sters are rare whereas Roadsters aren't (They are 
numerous!!) #2  Even though 'Sters are heavier they are safer and handle 
better #3  They are more solid  #4 they will up their 986 engine from 
200 to 250 bhp!!  (Not sure when exactly)  #5  They are prettier 
(Badder)  #6  Have a higher resale value (I am sure you will not be 
selling it, ever!) #7   it's a Porsche,  : >-Z-<

                                 '69 VW Bug
                                  '87 944
                                   '97 993 Twin Turbo (after college)
