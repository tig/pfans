 >    Is there not a distinction between manufacturing and assembly?  From 
     my understading all engines and running gear are made in Germany and 
     final assembly is in Valmet. I thought Valmet was the factory that 
     made the Saabs.  It may be next to the Lada line, but only in 
     proximity. 
     
     My salesman and ac magazine article in April '98 "Excellence", says 
     the paint work in Valmet is superior to Germany.<


Hi Ken, 

I don't think that there is any problem with the quality of the Boxsters built
in either Germany or Finland. They may have an image problem, but no real
problems. 
I wrote articles about our trip for several foreign publications and the
following article for Porsche Market Letter (PML). The editor of PML asked me
if I had driven a Boxster and my answer was: 

Yes, I have driven the Boxsters and do love them; they are the modern
Porsches. As you probably know, I was a long time 914/6 owner. I had one for
seventeen years, and I think that the Boxster is a modern version of the
914/6. A 914/6 with virtually all of the problems solved, including the looks.

I was one of those selected for a press junket in December to Finland and
Germany checking out the Boxster production and I had a most excellent visit
to the frozen north. Finland is a republic which only became independent in
1917. The population of Finland is about 5 and a half million people. They are
known as the land of forest and have lakes and other bodies of water that
cover 10% of their territory. 

Valmet is the name of the company that builds the Boxsters in Finland. Valmet
is in the port town, Uusikaupunki, near Turku, on the Swedish side of Finland.
When we visited Finland it was just a few days short of the winter solstice,
when the days are at their shortest. The sun didn't come up until about ten in
the morning and it was back to dark by three in the afternoon.  

Valmet is a multi-billion dollar manufacturer and the worlds largest producer
of paper making and board machines and related process controls. Valmet
automotive was founded thirty years ago in 1968 as a joint venture with Saab-
Scania. In 1992 Valmet bought out Saab and became the single shareholder. They
have built Saabs, Opels, Russian Avtovaz cars and now Porsches. 

The Boxsters built in Finland are the equal to the Boxsters built in Germany,
maybe a bit better. I felt that the fit and finish of the Finnish car was a
little better than the traditional German version. At Porsche in Germany they
told us that the there is less orange peel on the paint from Valmet and that
the clear coat finish is different. I couldn't be sure if they were
complimenting or criticizing the Fins. The Finnish clear is less prone to rock
chips while the German version was less prone to abrasions. The Valmet
automobile factory in Finland is in the port town of Uusikaupunki. They build
the cars outside of the town and then ship them from their port. 

In Stuttgart, they gave us the opportunity to drive each of the cars for about
25 miles. They made us guess which Boxster was which and the one with the
better fit and finish was actually the one from Finland. As I said, we drove
both and you could not tell the difference in driving them. 

Porsche signed the deal with Valmet in Finland last January and Tuesday
December 16, 1997, while we were in Uusikaupunki, Finland they shipped the
2000th Finnish Boxster. They have done a really impressive job of getting the
production up and running in a very short period of time. We were all very
impressed with Valmet and the Finnish people. 

Porsche had to make some serious changes or they were not going to last. The
alternatives were fix it, sell it or lose it. I am willing to put up with the
changes to see them still running the ship. I'm afraid that if they had to
sell it, that it never would have been the same. As it is I find both the
Boxster and the 996 to be extremely desirable cars, I would like one of each. 

Because both Boxster and the 911 sales have been so successful, Porsche has
exceeded their production capabilities and in some parts of the world there is
a waiting list for delivery of a Boxster that is over a year. A year is too
long and all but the very persistent will give up and buy something else.
During their 1996/97 business year Porsche built 20,000 993s and 12,000
Boxsters. Originally, when the new Stuttgart-Zufenhausen plant was built, they
planned the maximum production of 30,000 cars annually, but with their
improved production with "Lean Thinking" and running three shifts in most
areas, they were able to increase that maximum to 32,000, which was still not
enough to meet their increased sales.

Porsche decided that in order to fill their sales needs that they needed
additional production capability for the Boxster. They considered building new
production facilities in Germany or the US but decided that it would take too
long to get into production in either location and a new production facility
would also require a large capital equipment investment. Because the US is
Porsches largest market, the US had a strong appeal to Porsche management. Dr.
Wendelin Wiedeking said that the politicians in the United States were very
cooperative and encouraged Porsche to locate a new manufacturing facility in
the US. However, in the end they decided that it would take too long, require
too many people and the cost would be too high. 

They also considered working with a partner to produce additional cars and
reviewed a number of different possibilities before selecting Valmet
Automotive in the harbor town of Uusikaupunki, Finland as the best match.
Valmet was selected because their own lean thinking production procedures and
their modern efficient facility would allow them to meet the objectives of
earliest possible start-up of production while maintaining Porsche's very high
quality standards. Valmet Automotive had re-engineered their management and
gone with the "Lean Thinking" management five years before Porsche did the
same. 

Porsche was concerned of what the perception would be of the Boxsters from
Scandinavia, so in the middle of December, they had a small group of the motor
press travel to the Valmet plant in Finland and then to the Porsche plant in
Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen to compare the production procedures and the Boxsters
built in these two locations. I was fortunate enough to be selected to go on
that tour, and even though we almost spent the winter solstice in Finland, it
was an enjoyable trip. Interestingly, it was actually colder an Stuttgart than
in Finland by a couple of degrees and mostly above freezing in both places our
whole stay, so it was not bad at all. 

Porsche said that they expect Valmet to be a long term partner. They have the
ability of changing the mix of production. By building more Boxsters in
Valmet, they can build more 911s in their Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen facility.
Their initial agreement was to build 5,000 cars in Finland, but if the Boxster
sales continue at the rate that they have been selling and the 996 version of
the 911 is the success that they expect it to be, they can increase the
quantity of Boxsters built in Finland and build more 911s in Germany to meet
the market demand. They expect to build 38,000 cars during the 1997/98
business year. With their added production capability at Valmet Porsche
expects to be able to cut their delivery time for their cars to six months. 

Ken,

Incidentally the Lauda bodies are made at the same Valmet site where the Saab
Cabrio and the Boxster are built, but the cars are assembled somewhere else so
that none of the Lauda rubs off on the other cars. You hardly see any sign of
them at all at the Valmet factory.
