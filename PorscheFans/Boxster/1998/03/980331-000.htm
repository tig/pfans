I just wanted to forward this response to the entire list because I'm sure
there are other people out there interested in European delivery.  To me,
one of the key reasons behind buying a Porsche is the Euro delivery - I
don't understand why everyone doesn't do it :-)  Think about it - a new
Porsche, and the unlimited speeds on the Autobahn - seems like an
unbeatable combo to me!

Anyway here is the best link (great work Berkeley!) if you're interested:

>Hi Brian!  I just wanted to ask you how you arranged your porsche pick up
and is it a better price difference by doing it this way.  I'm looking for
the best way to purchase a German Boxster at a good price rather than a
Finish (Finland) model.	Thanks ,  Mark Gomez
