I currently own a 96 328 convert, a 91 300 ZX, 64 Austin Healey, and 59 TR 3.
I drove and debated between Z3 and Boxster, until I actually sat in cockpit
and then drove them.  The Z3 was a disappointment.  Other than the front end
styling, I couldn't find a thing that convinced me to buy that instead of the
Boxster.  In fact, I'd rather be driving my 300 ZX (22000 miles, my Florida
car) than the Z3.
6 months ago, there was a Z3 for sale in Sarasota, FL want ad for $29000.  A
year ago there was one for sale in Madison Wi for $29,500. 
The M will be a screamer, I'm sure.  
I'm thrilled with driving the Boxster, and expect to go on many extended tours
this summer.  To me, its the contemporary extension of the classic Porsche
roadster.  And, it was designed from bottom up, all new.  
Sit in the cockpit, then really drive them both.  Go with your heart.
