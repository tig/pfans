Folks, 

I'll be picking up my Boxster in Stuttgart in June and plan to spend 4 to 6
weeks driving around Europe in it. 

I'm wondering if anyone has some tips on things to watch out for in my
travels. I've heard that Berlin has the highest crime rate in Europe - so I
plan to stay away from there. Also, I've heard and read bad things about
car vandalism and theft in Italy and Spain. Can anyone confirm or deny
these? Also, while I'm getting the alarm system, I'm wondering if I need
anything else - for example something like the "club" or something to deter
theft. 

Any input greatly appreciated, I really hate the idea of having the car
vandalized or stolen before I even get it home. 

Lastly, are there any great roads that you'd recommend driving in Europe -
perhaps you know of some particularly beautiful, curvy roads that would be
a fun drive.  I've driven from Innsbruck to Bolzano over the Italian alps
once and had a blast - and may do that again.  But if you have some great
roads to recommend please let me know.

Thanks,

Brian.
