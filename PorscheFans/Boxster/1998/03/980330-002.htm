I have had my baby for a month now. 98 white/gray supple leather, loaded SPE
(58k Champion Porsche). 

I drive on the Sawgrass Expway (S. FL) every day to work (30 miles). The nose
of my car is getting beat to hell buy all Dragon bugs and rocks from trucks. 

I purchased a Bra for it over the weekend. The Bra instruction says it for the
1997 Boxster. I have adjusted it, but there seems to be excess material in the
middle of the headlights that is creating a tunnel effect. 

I called the dealer this morning, they said that there is NO difference in the
nose from 97 to 98. Has anyone else had this experience or problem?

PS - the Bra looks killer! I didn't put the hood piece on, only the front. I
also got the Bra for the mirrors, between the Bra's and the Titanium tint -
she is definitely a Bitch!
