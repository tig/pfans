Mark and Others,

There is a great book that came out a number of years ago called "The
Machine that Changed the World" - great reading for anyone planning to buy
a new car.
you can see it at:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0060974176/9955-1414335-813740

It Based on MIT's five-year, 14-country study of the worldwide auto industry.

There is one key point in the book that could be seen to relate directly to
the Porsche Boxster manufacturing issue:

1. At the time the book was written Japanese Auto producers took an average
of 1.4 months to return to Normal Quality after beginning production of a
new vehicle model, compared to 11 months for the average American car
company and 12 months for the average European car company.  While Porsche
took the wise move of eventually adopting the lean production techniques of
the Japanese it took many years and you have to wonder how quickly that
expertise is filtering up to Finland.  Given all the complaints I hear from
people about the quality of the past two years of Boxsters I'd have to say
I suspect that they have a long way to go.  This is the key reason I've
waited until the 99 model year and 4 or 5 year warranty kicks in. (see
http://boxster.dyn.ml.org/archive022898.html    
for just one of many examples of the problems)

A second point in the Image article relates to at least one of the key
reasons people purchase a Porsche.  I believe that - rightly or wrongly -
some of the top reasons that people buy a Porsche (and its resale value
stays high) is because of 1. image, 2. performance, 3. quality

If the Boxster manufacturing is being moved entirely to finland as has been
reported on Boxster.org, and a car with one of the world's worst quality
reputation is being built right beside it (i.e. the LADA) two key aspects
of the car's qualities are likely affected - 1. image, and 2. quality.

Will Porsche every release the true quality reports that compare the two
factories - Valmet and Zuffenhausen?? I doubt it!

No - Porsche isn't the only one to have employees that could build a
Porsche.  The fact is I'd feel a lot more comfortable buying a Porsche if
it were manufactured in Japan than Germany or Finland.  The quality of the
Leading Japanese car companies really is rock solid as is reported in many
car quality surveys.  

The fact is there is a "learning curve" to building complex products - I
work in the computer industry and I wouldn't recommend buying any Release
1.0 product. With cars its even worse because you can't upgrade easily.
This is, I suspect why many people on this list are dumping their first
boxsters and buying their second.  No question the car's a great car - but
quality has taken a long time coming, and I believe that the Valmet plant
has taken longer than the Zufenhausen plan to get up to the same quality
levels.  This, and the fact that the "guilt by association" of being built
in the same factor as the infamous Russian car are my two important points.

Anyway, this is my view point.  I'm still buying the car - I'd just prefer
to have it built in Germany. (or Japan).  I think this would help the car's
image, quality and resale value.

Brian.
