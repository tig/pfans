I'd be concerned in old eastern block and Italy.  We rented a Lancia in Italy
last year and were constantly being cautioned about car theft.  We had no
problems, then we weren't driving a Boxster.
You won't have any problems finding fun place to drive.  your  problem will be
to hold her at 4000 rpms until 1000 miles.
PS Road tour today, 80 degrees in Wisconsin (spring?) with Boxster and
friend's XKE.  We had a great time on country roads, drove 150 miles on roads
with no lines!  At end of day, his restored beauty (E type is the all time
beauty in my book) was blowing a lot of gray-blue smoke out of those quad
exhausts.  He said it was worth it.  We switched cars along the way and I had
a heck of a time getting him out of the Boxster.
Great driving day with good friends.  Our wives say we haven't grown up, but
they do love being seen in these cars!!  Finally, my wife took the wheel and
things have changed.  This could get serious!
Cheers
Roger
