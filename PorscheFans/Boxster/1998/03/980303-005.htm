Please refer to the link at the top of Porsche Pete's Board or
boxster.org for previously posted information on the Las Vegas
Boxster gathering.

The deadline (March 16) for reserving a room at the Imperial Palace for
the nights of April 17th and 18th is drawing near. Please make your
reservations soon. We NEED a TOTAL number attending to complete
arrangements for:

1) the 7 AM Saturday get acquainted breakfast at Imperial Palace (~$10).

2) the 8 AM tech session by Terry Wells at Gaudin Porsche.

3) the Port O Subs box lunches/drinks for the convoy to Valley of Fire
picnic/walk/chat/drive (~$6).

4) the 7 PM group dinner at the Bootlegger Ristorante ($20, $25, $35
includes tax/gratuity; each offers 3 entrees from 10 - 12 choices - a
feast)

We are assuming that those reserved at the Imperial Palace and those
who have contacted Mark as attending but not staying at the hotel will
all join us in the above activities. Anyone else attending should contact
Mark at mlys@cyberramp.net so that we can make reservations for meals.

Saturday convoy through the Valley of Fire (start time will begin as the
tech session ends). Bring a small cooler for the box lunch and drink,
hand held CB (owned or rental) if you would like to chat along the way.

Sunday convoy through Red Rock Canyon (start time to be decided Saturday
night); view points, trails on a 12 mile loop ($5/vehicle park fee);
finish ~noon or 1 PM. Those who must leave earlier won't be far from =
I-15.

Another update will be posted this coming weekend on event shirt
information. PLEASE WATCH for it as there will only be about a week to
collect orders and payment for the shirts.
