It's interesting that some think only Germans, preferably Porsche employees,
can competently put together a Boxster.  Sure, it would be aesthetically-
intellectually- pleasing for your vehicle to come from "the Porsche
factory".  But SO many parts, mechanical, etc., are out-sourced, that the
idea that Porsches are built by PORSCHE ALONE is a joke.  As long as the
Finns are producing the Boxster to Porsche's specs, as long as Porsche is
happy with what they are getting, I doubt the product is any different than
if Porsche WAS producing all of it.  In a perfect world, if your car was
rear-ended, I guess you would like to send it back to the factory for
repair.  However, except in extreme cases, I expect a carefully chosen local
body shop is going to do the work.  Does a car no longer qualify to be
called a Porsche after a 'merican repairs it?
