I'm new to this list, and I guess I'm an interloper: I don't own a Boxster,
or any model of Porsche; I'm a BMW man who now sees the error of his ways.

I intend to buy a used Boxster as soon as I can find one that's reasonably
priced -- i.e. advertised at a lower price than the owner paid for it. This
may be a futile ambition, but hope springs eternal.  I have heard
murmerings about the Boxster being a problem vehicle.  Is this the case?
If so, what, generally, are the problems?  Any suggestions about what to
look for in a used vehicle would be appreciated.  I'd appreciate, too,
recommendations on what options (the number of which is almost
overwhelming) should be included.

Your advice is much appreciated.  Thanks.
