Hmmm... this has got to be a PR disaster for the Porsche folks...
especially now that all Boxsters will be produced in Finland.

HEADLINE: Motor plant where Ladas get the Porsche treatment: 
Assembling specialist models for other manufacturers can be 
profitable but risky. Tim Burt reports from outsourcer Valmet: 

BODY: 
   Few Porsche dealers mention the fact, but many of the German
group's Boxster sports cars are put together on a production line barely
10 paces from one assembling Lada hatchbacks. 

In the small Finnish town of Uusikaupunki, some of the most prestigious
cars are assembled alongside some of the humblest. A short walk from
the Lada line is the dedicated assembly shop for Saab convertibles, the
Swedish motor company's flagship model. 

Officials at Valmet Automotive, Finland's one and only car assembly
company, say proudly that they assemble Lada's Samara model to
Porsche and Saab standards, not the other way round. The company
has benefited from the increased willingness to outsource by the
world's leading carmakers. 

For the most part, that trend has been focused on sourcing components
elsewhere. But carmakers including Porsche, Saab, Chrysler, Fiat and
Peugeot-Citroen have also farmed out the entire assembly of models
which are either too specialist or time-consuming to produce in their
own plants. 

The contract assemblers - including Valmet, Karmann of Germany,
Pininfarina and Bertone of Italy - argue that they fulfil a useful function
by relieving volume car manufacturers of sometimes troublesome
models. 

It is more cost-effective for Saab, for example, to ship the body panels
and engines for its convertibles to a Finnish assembly plant, rather than
disrupt its regular production line with the additional tooling and
engineering required for soft-top models. 

"We think there is a growing market for this kind of operation," says
Veli-Pekka Vasama, executive vice-president at Valmet. "Big
carmakers want to reduce the complexity of their plants by sourcing
from outside." 

Growing demand for such services helped lift profits at Valmet
Automotive from FM105m ($ 18.8m) to FM112m last year on sales of
FM583m. 

At 19 per cent, the profit margin is certainly above the motor industry
average. And it shows just how much manufacturers are prepared to
pay for outsourcing specialist models. 

The margins may look handsome for the likes of Valmet or Austria's
Stey- Daimler-Puch, which assembles models for Daimler Benz and
Chrysler. But there are risks on both sides. 

For the carmakers, the downside is the potential loss of quality control
in final assembly - with all the consumer dissatisfaction that can cause. 

For the assemblers, there is always a risk that the manufacturer may
take back production as soon as there is excess capacity in its own
plants. Alternatively, they may decide to drop some outsourced models
together. 

That has made for a hand-to-mouth existence in the assembly industry.
Valmet found that out last year, when Adam Opel ended production of
its Calibra model, assembled in Finland. 

It could face the same difficulty next year, when its contract to
assemble Samaras for Lada expires. "We have either to secure a
replacement model for the same customer of find a new one," says Mr
Vasama. "It is one of the risks of the business." 

Valmet, which already has spare capacity at its Uusikaupunki plant, is
trying to maintain links with both Lada and General Motors, which
owns Adam Opel, by exploring the possibility of building a new
assembly plant across the Russian border in Karel'skaya. 

Discussions with AutoVAZ, Lada's parent, GM are said to be
continuing. But the US and Russian groups have this week hinted that
they may decide to go it alone by building a plant in central Russia
instead. 

"GM's interest is to enter the Russian market. We are working on this
and we are in talks, but the outcome remains an open question," says
Mr Vasama. 

In the meantime, Valmet has embarked on outsourcing negotiations
with other manufacturers. Among its selling points, the Finnish group
says it has one of the most flexible workforces in the motor industry -
many of them women. 

"Nowhere else will you see assembly workers move from a mid-engine
Porsche straight on to a front-wheel drive Saab," according to one line
manager in Uusikaupunki. "Flexibility in this business is the key to
success."
