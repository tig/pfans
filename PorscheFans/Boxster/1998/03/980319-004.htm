HEADLINE: Revving Up the Kitchen; Porsche Rolls Out a
Toaster 

For those who consider driving a Porsche roadster to be one of
life's ultimate sensual experiences, hold on to your Pop-Tarts.The
first Porsche toaster -- sleek, streamlined and precision engineered
-- is about to zip onto privileged American kitchen counters. 

Constructed of thick brushed aluminum with midnight blue trim, its
aerodynamic styling has that unmistakable look of high-performance
German craftsmanship. Its exacting quartz heating element cuts
down on waiting time. This toaster doesn't rudely thrust crusty
bread slices in your face; it lifts them gently for a smooth,
well-calibrated browning experience. 

This lean, mean silvery uber-toaster will cost you $ 175. But think
how perfectly it will complement that trendy stainless Sub-Zero
refrigerator and Vulcan stove. 

If fast cars and fast women scare you, a fast toaster could be more
your speed. 

"Design is neither form alone nor function alone, but the aesthetic
synthesis of the two." So says F. A. Porsche, grandson of legendary
automaker Ferdinand Porsche. His Austrian firm, Porsche Design, a
sister company of the automaker, keeps alive the cachet of the
Porsche name beyond the autobahn, developing luxury products
from $ 2,500 titanium cameras to $ 4,500 mountain bikes. 

Porsche Design pots and pans, manufactured by the Italian firm
Barazzoni, not only bring water to a boil, they catch water droplets
in lids elegantly grooved with concentric circles, and resist scratches
with an outside coating of titanium-ceramic alloy. All that Porsche
craftsmanship, technology and advanced materials doesn't come
cheap: A seven-piece set is $ 1,050. 

The Porsche Design two-slice toaster was previewed at the
International Housewares Show in Chicago in January. It's part of a
new line of appliances for Toastmaster, a Columbia, Mo., company
that has been selling pop-up toasters to middle America since 1926.
The Porsche Design collection includes a high-tech electric kettle ($
120) and a coffee maker with its own thermal carafe ($ 200).
They'll be available in July at select stores or the six U.S. Porsche
Design boutiques, scattered from Aspen, Colo., to Bal Harbour, Fla.


It sounds like a stylish leap for Toastmaster, whose top non-designer
toasting machine sells for a modest $ 31. Porsche Design also may
be a leap for Washingtonians, who tend to chauffeur kids around in
sturdy station wagons and sport utility vehicles, not Porsche
Boxsters. 

"D.C. is not really a Porsche town," says Sarah Sebastian, retail
operations manager for the American arm of Porsche Design based
in Beverly Hills, Calif. 

Washingtonians who think they can handle a Porsche in the kitchen
will be able to order from a toll-free number (1-800-521-5152).
Those who want a Porsche in the utility closet will have to wait.
What could be the ultimate in status cleaners, the Porsche Design
vacuum, is due out in 1999.
