I own an all black '98 Boxster with sport classic (spoked BBS style) wheels.
Hence, I am biased.  Keeping that in mind:

The M car will be much quicker than the Boxster.   BMW has free maintenance
for 3 years (I think).  Two points for the BMW.

There a many Z3 1.9 and 2.8s on the road.  Yes, I am aware of the cosmetic
differences between those two cars and the upcoming M car.  However, they are
subtle differences and there will many Z-type BMWs on the road.   Contrarily,
there are far fewer Boxsters giving the Porsche a sense of exclusivity.   You
may or may not like this.  I enjoy it.

I think the Boxster is more unique looking and gorgeous; let your own eyes be
the judge.

The Boxster has more storage space, better handling, and less wind buffeting
--important when driving at 75mph--with the top down.  It is a larger car both
externally and on the inside.  I felt a bit cramped in the Z3; not so in the
Boxster.  This is important when you are 6"2" tall.    I drove the 2.8 litre
Z3 and the Boxster; the articles confim the above.  These are objective and
not subjective characteristics.

I drive the car about 3-4 workdays and on weekends. I have a 50 mi round trip
to work.  I really enjoy this car and have no regrets about having purchased
it.  If you decide to get one and order a new car, I'd be glad to offer my
humble, ahem, opinion on what options are worthwhile and which are not.

Jim
