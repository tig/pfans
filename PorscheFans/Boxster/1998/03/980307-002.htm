I ordered a Boxster w/ tiptronic in November.  Last month, I was told it
was slated for March production.  Having read the archives, I understand
that the dealer should be able to give me an exact production date. 
Over the past two weeks, I have been pressing for one, but have been
told that the best information they have is "mid-March" production. 
(Supposedly, PCNA's move from Reno to Atlanta has caused computer
problems.)  

Questions:

1. Should I feel confident that this car will actually be produced in
Mid-march (or any other time in March)?

2.  Have there been delays with tiptronics?

3. I am told that from production to delivery is four to six weeks.  Is
that accurate?
