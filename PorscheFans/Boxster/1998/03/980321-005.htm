Well, a number of autocrossers who run National-level SCCA Solo II and Pro
Solo events are _speculating_  that those "lousy 50 more h.p." might result
in the Boxster "S", whenever it arrives, being classed in Super Stock (where
with the additional h.p. it would be a likely winner) instead of the present
car's
classing in A Stock, where it is competitive but a little bit of an underdog
at
the National level of SCCA Solo II.  And given Porsche's history of upgrading
the performance of a model as it ages, few would argue that an "S" version of
the Boxster will eventually appear; the only speculation is when it will
happen.

Oh, and that supercharger would put the Boxster in a Prepared or Modified
class in SCCA where it would most assuredly not be competitive without more
extensive modifications, though your point about the likely cost-effectiveness
of a blower installation vs. the probable cost of an "S" model is well-taken.

Just my .02,
