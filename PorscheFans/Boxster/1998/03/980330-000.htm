Many thanks from everyone on their great feedback on driving in Europe
experiences and suggestions.  I'll be taking my laptop with me to work a
bit while I'm there and will be loggin onto the Internet to check mail and
post messages - I'll definitely try to provide some updates as I travel
through Europe and a report on my driving experience.

I'm still waiting for a precise delivery date from Porsche which is making
the whole trip planning effort a little more difficult than anticipated.
All I know right now is that it is a June or possibly late May production.
Luckily I'm going with a group of friends who will also be renting a car so
I've got transportation until my Boxster is ready - but Geez, it would be
nice to know when the car will be ready.

In terms of a quick summary on the feedback on travelling in Europe it
seems to be:

1. German roads (and perhaps all North-eastern Europe) are great (I have
driven around there, just not in a Porsche) - but try to avoid the major
cities, and hit the road early and on weekdays to avoid crowds (I love the
idea of 6am runs down the Autobahn and over the Alps as the only car on the
road!)

2. Boxsters in Eastern Europe, Spain, or Italy (especially Southern Italy)
are probably a bad idea (despite what the Boxster book shows :-).  But I'm
strongly considering Northern Italy because we could stay outside the
cities (e.g. outside Florence, Cinque Terre, Lake Cuomo, etc.) and drive
into town with the other car we'll have - leaving the Porsche in the
country Pensione. I'm hoping the country pensiones are relatively safe -
i.e. that the Mafia won't steal the car and part-it out before I return at
the end of the day!

By the way Denny, I did an "Automobile Tour" the last time I spent
significant time in Europe.  I started in Stuttgart with tours of the
Mercedes factory and Museum, then on to Zuffenhausen for the museum there
(couldn't get in the Factory at that point) then drove over the Alps to
Modena (Ferrari) and Lamborghini and De Tomaso.  This was an
Around-the-world trip I was on, so in Japan I also visited the Nissan
factory in Yokahama - all in all a great trip.  Of course some friends
really couldn't get into all the car factory photo's I came back with after
the trip :-)

Thanks again, 

Brian.

From: Konstantin

Also, I've heard and read bad things about
car vandalism and theft in Italy and Spain.
>>>Italy: do not lett your car if you can't see it. park only at big
hotels with safety parking personal. Don't let other park your
car.(avoid copying your key).
Drive only on the day and aon big and light roads. (in the city)
The same for Paris, Spain, Portugal and Amsterdam. The German cities are
the safest the same for the Autobahn. Don't drive to the eastern block
countries!!!!!!!!!! Poland etc.
If you stay in Austria ,Germany, Swiss, DK, Swedeen you don't have  big
problems. In the big cities of other countries you must be very carefull
where you park your car. You can ask the Porsche people when you pick
your car in Stuttgart. Maybe I will be in Stuttgart at this time and I
can help you but I can't promissed it now. If you buy the Porsche credit
card ~$50 you can park your car at the airport (any airport) without to
paiy for it and when you came back you pick it clean and safe back. (at
AVIS or SIXT I am not sure which of them) If you want to visit Athen (I
recomend you to visit Greece) or Rom, Amsterdam, Budapest etc, it is
safer if you park your car at the airport and fly with the plane. You
can fly to london or paris for $150 at the summer. If you want to drive
you need a very good and safe hotel.

Brian,

Congratulations!! What an exciting trip to be planning -- I'm totally green
with envy.

Although it has been awhile, I lived in Germany for three years and spent a
month there two summers ago after Euro delivery of my 850R wagon (family of
4), so I have a few thoughts to share with you:

AUTOBAHNS -- As with most enthusiasts, they are one of the great attractions
and "must-do's" of Europe. However, they can be very crowded and speedlimits
are now very widespread. If you stay away from major population areas like
the central corridor (Koln, Frankfurt, Stuttgart) you will find very
enjoyable high speed driving. My favorite was Nurenburg to Munich. Be
careful, though. Unlike years ago, I was very frustrated by slower traffic
pulling into the fast lane without ANY consideration of closing speeds of
approaching traffic. Sometimes it would be a truck doing 40 pulling out to
pass another truck doing 35!! Even the Boxster's outstanding brakes may be
put to the test.

GREAT DRIVES -- Rather than specific roads, I have found several "areas"
where nearly every road is great. First is obviously the Alps, which you
mentioned, and mountain pass roads are nearly always the best. My two
favorite areas are back roads along the Cote'D Azur in southern France, and
the Eifel Mountains of German and neighboring Belgium.

What I like about the southern France area is not only the roads, but being
able to play all day up in the mountains and then drop back into Monte
Carlo/Monaco or St. Tropez or Cannes for some civilization and food and
scenery and beauty. Or you might consider a route from Switzerland (Geneva)
south through the mountains to Monaco. From there you may want to head
towards Lake Como in northern Italy.

Further north, both the areas I mentioned are home to two of the great race
tracks of the world, Spa Forncachamps (sp?) in Belgium and the Nurburing in
Germany. Pay about $15 and take a lap (at speed if you wish) around the 13
mile track and you'll remember it forever!

Another area which has wonderful roads, but may be a bit crowded in the
summer is the Black Forest in southern Germany.

IDEA -- Most people going to Europe plan a "tourist" sort of trip. I know my
last trip was exactly that because I wanted to show my kids Europe and go to
all the really great spots like Salzburg, Geneva, Paris, London and so
forth. If that's your plan, the hard part is narrowing things down so you
can fit it into 6 weeks.

However, one thing I've always wanted to do is a "Automobile" Tour. The
concept is to tour the plants of Porsche (which I imagine you're already
doing), Mercedes, BMW, Ferrari, and to visit Weisach, RUF, McLaren, Jaguar,
great car museums (Schlumpf, etc.), race tracks like the Nurburing, LeMans
and so forth. This might also include attending Formula 1 races or other
events as well. I was contacted a few weeks ago by someone who organizes
this sort of thing as a "tour" and it sounded like great fun. But you could
plan your own just as well.

PLANNING -- One other general note, check into an area's "holiday" schedule.
I'll never forget a 5 hour traffic jam at the border years ago when nearly
all of Germany went on holiday during the same two week period. I can't say
I ran into this at all on my last trip, but it can be one of the greatest
nightmares if you do encounter it. Just ask as you're making reservations.

I enjoyed the planning almost as much (well, maybe not almost) as the trip
itself -- it's great fun to explore the many, many possiblities.
Particularly if you don't have a particular agenda in mind. Let me know if
you need anything more.

Brian,

Have you driven down the Romantic?  You will see lots of castles.  I think
it goes through the Heidelberg area, too.  If you stop in Heidelberg, pay
close attention to the parking signs....it is a college town and the cops
really watch to see if you have a decal in your window....even on the public
cobblestone streets.  (If memory serves me well, you pay fines at the post
office.....lol)  Anyway, put the top down and enjoy!  It is a gorgeous
drive!  River is along the road quite often...(I think it is the Blue
Danube, but I can't remember...)  surroundings are very
green....serene....safe.

Be very careful in Italy.....especially in Florence and Rome.  (Both cities
are worth a visit...the history is unbelievable....but they drive on the
sidewalks in Florence.....they have 45 people in tiny Fiats and lay on the
horns..Yep, crime is high in both places!!!!)  If you stay at any hotels or
pensions, be sure to pay extra for protected parking...   Park your car and
do not drive it again until you leave....if you do not get it stolen, you
will get in a wreck!  Rome has great bus service and people walk a lot in
both cities...
We were very conscious of our surroundings throughout Italy...maybe the most
relaxed place was Assisi... pickpockets about at Pisa, too!    Wear a money
belt throughout Italy...do not let anybody on a moped or cycle come close to
you when you are afoot.

 As far as the club goes, if they want the car badly enough, they can
quickly saw the steering wheel off....and be gone before the cops show
up......if they bother to show up at all.       You don't know me from Adam,
but I am not prejudiced at all...I have friends of all colors, all beliefs,
all over the world.....I was a programmer analyst for many years....it is
like a melting pot...but still, I must say that I place police officers in
Florence and Rome in a category with those from Mexico....not to be
trusted....BE VERY CAREFUL IN ITALY!!!!!

We have stayed in the countryside around Salzburg.....gorgeous
area.....Sound of Music was filmed there......       Salzburg is neat too!
I think those dancing white horses are from there.  (Can't think of their
name, maybe it starts with an 'R').    Salzburg has a casino.  Salzburg also
has this huge castle-type-of-place on a high-hill that has a lot of
historical stuff in it....torture stuff...Nazi stuff......it is upsetting,
but nonetheless, interesting.
Mozart was born in Salzburg......many hotels are in the middle of
residential areas....safe.

Any drive through the Dolomites is worth it!  When you see those slopes,
there is no question as to why Tomba won all those gold medals at the
Olympics!   We stayed in a small tourist village...the name evades me at
this time...I want to say something like Corona de Ampazzio or
something...it was on the way to the Italian Riviera area, where most
Italians vacation when the country basically shuts down....it's safe
there....rental car had no problem either.

We have always felt safe in West Germany.  Frieberg, Freudenstadt, Munchen,
(go to the Hof Brau Haus...watch the women carry 6 of those biers in each
hand....).  The Black Forest is a pretty drive......different from
Alps....but pretty.....  Oberammergau is a gorgeous little village.....lots
of Christmas shops....Passion Play.....safe there to park a car.....
Munich is a very active place.....lots of people.....always display
caution...gypsy thieves, among others......but a helluva lot safer than Rome
or Florence...   In Munich, go see the Glockenspiel at the Marien Platz....
Frankfurt is just an industrial city with an airport.....

I don't know where you live, but I can tell you that the wine country of
France is much like that of California.  Also, central Italy is much like
central California.   Vineyards.....hot in summer....  Italy just has more
olives, lol.  (I was raised with vineyards, so these areas did not impress
me....)  You may need a visa to get into France, I dunno.

Switzerland is gorgeous and safe........and clean!  If you are anywhere near
Lake Lucerne, stop.....even if just for lunch....the view of the Matterhorn
is breath taking...

Also, have you been to Dachau?  It numbs the soul.  (Nope, I am not Jewish.)

I might have spelled some of these places incorrectly, but my husband lived
in Deutschland while in the service and we have vacationed in Europe a
couple of times..

Austria, Switzerland and Germany are my favorites!  Lichtenstein is very
tiny, but safe.

And yes, edilweiss does grow on the mountain tops outside of Salzburg...just
like Julie Andrews said.....lol.

Take LOTS of lira  for the toll roads of Italy and take lots of pfennings
for the toilets in Deutschland!     lol     The larger cities take credit
cards and the small villages have never heard of them.....when you are low
on cash..seek out Amex offices...they give you better deals than banks and
train stations.....and if you are in Italy...do not let anybody see you take
your money out...and do not leave anything visible in your car....your top
will be slashed in a second.....I AM NOT KIDDING!
(There is an AMEX office near the Spanish Steps in Rome.....next door to a
McDonalds...    Also, Salzburg has an Amex office.)

If you do go to Rome, see the Forum, Coliseum, Vatican, Sistine Chapel.....

Have a great time...hope I have helped out a little bit......

Hi Brian,

I am pretty sure that you are already aware of how difficult the 
Autobahns have become in the last 20 years-  many restricted sections, 
heavy traffic with dangerous tailbacks at many exits and the total 
misnomer that these roads are 'the best' in Europe.

A couple of things on driving in Europe and where to find the 'best' 
touring roads from someone who has driven as far west as Spain and as 
far east as Romania-  There are a lot of great drives!!

The more obvious ones are in Italy.  Autostrada travel is high-speed and 
relatively safe.  There are some exciting stretches of excellent grade 
autostrada especially south of Bologna in direction Roma through Tuscany 
and Umbria-  twists, tunnels, near mountains and loads of tunnels-  with 
the potential to truly 'test' your car and driving skills.  Even better, 
but slightly less safe is the Superstrada between Modena through 
Bologna, Sienna and towards Roma-  what a drive!!

Again excellent for fast cars is the route north out of Genoa to Milano 
(very hairy but loads-o-fun) with a less fun but very fast stretch up to 
the Swiss border.

Looking east-  the very best 'fun' can be had going cross country 
through the Czech Republic to eastern Poland near Krakov and then 
returning to Germany by driving west cross country through Poland to the 
German border.  Roads are not brilliantly set-up, there are few 
services, but you will see little traffic- you can drive flat out and it 
is true '30-s' style Grand Touring with loads of cheapish stop-overs.

I have to say that for safety I prefer high-speed driving in Italy on 
the most challenging stretches of Autostrada-  but for touring fun the 
East is hard to beat.

Security:  Umm...a tough one, because you can't really predict how this 
will go- even based on some relatively reliable intelligence.  I guess 
I'd say that when leaving the car unattended in Italy you should be fine 
in any smaller provincial town or city-  in bigger cities you need 
garage parking only- or protected hotel parking.  In the former eastern 
bloc nearly all the more expensive hotels have guraded parking as 
standard- so you're OK there, but you can also pay the concierge to 
'look after' your expensive new toy.  Payment will be expected in most 
eastern bloc states- but your car should be OK.  Italians respect 
beautiful cars, and generally have done nothing but admire my two older 
Porsches, looking but not touching.  That said-  I don't park it out in 
Naples, and I don't leave it out in Apuglia or Sicily-  just a 
precaution.  I've never had a problem in Rome, Venice, Genoa, or any of 
the smaller cities (perhaps luck?).

I would recommend robust insurance cover as the best possible course of 
action- and ensure you're covered for eastern Europe if travelling that 
way-  another thought...don't go into Ukraine, or far eastern Poland, 
don't even think about going into Russia-  but do consider going into 
Hungary and the Carpathian mountains of Romania-  bad roads and 
incredible driving adventures!!

Good luck, Gute Reise, and watch yourself on the Autobahn-  those 
on-the-spot speeding fines can really smart!!
