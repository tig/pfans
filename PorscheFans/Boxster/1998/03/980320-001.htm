Re:  "Boxster Image Hurt By Lada";  Oh boy, somebody is subscribing to a news
clipping service.  In the process us hill people are blessed with the
privilege of reading drivel.
Best of all, of course, is the erroneous information so poorly researched and
written (and from the Financial Times too, who would'a thunk)- I really want
to clutter my mind with such crap.

Can't help but wonder where this guy has been to say this:
<<Hmmm... this has got to be a PR disaster for the Porsche folks...
especially now that all Boxsters will be produced in Finland.>>

Fer one;  Porsche is quite pleased by their contract with Valmat, it is
considered an excellent facility- perfect for the job (in fact, their PR
department has been publicizing the contract in many automotive trade
publications.)  The Valmat issue has been discussed thoroughly here as well.
Fer two;  not ALL Boxster are going to be built at Valmat, only those going to
the U.S. market specifically.  The demand was such that Porsche did the best
thing possible, jobbed the construction (not fabrication) to Valmat to fill
the orders.
Fer three;  if proximity is something to be considered valid, then them brake
calipers (sic Brembo) on the Boxster have it running with the big dogs.

Re:  "S" Model speculation:
While dealers are taking deposits for "S" mod Boxsters, and while banter
abounds about how many horses extra yer gonna get for the money (a low of
$6,000.00 USD to a high of $20,000.00 CDN) Porsche, AG is MUM on the issue.  
There has been NO official announcement from them (and they'd be the ones to
know).
Speculation is defined as "contemplation of a profound nature", and man-o-man,
this "S" bs proves it.

Gotta ask though;  why would someone want a lousy 50 more h.p. and a wing for
$10,000.00 USD (avg) when they can slap a supercharger on (read recent Pano
article by Bruce A.) for $5,000.00 USD and get 100 h.p.?  But, before anyone
goes and speculates on that answer, fill me in on what a lousy 50 h.p. is
going to give you in the long run - bragging rights??

I'm just about to order my second Boxster for Euro Delivery.  It'll be a 1999
with the four year warranty, and probably in the same colors as my first one.
If I want to race it from light to light against Z3's or Corvettes I won't be
getting the "S".  Frankly, I wouldn't do anything so stupid.
It'd be more prudent to wait for the forthcoming "Fixing Up der Boxster"
books, or buying a real race car and doing all that machismo shit on the
track.

[For as much as everything changes, it remains the same;  these must be the
same discussions had by 356 owners when the "S" 1500 was rumored! c. 1953]
*pardon the vent, just had to.
