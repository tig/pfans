Leo,

When I pay $50,000 for a car I feel like I've earned the right to 
comment
on the product - Please don't consider this a "Flame" but rather the 
expression
of a sincere concern that I really hope gets back to Porsche management 
and
engineers in these days of plenty - so that they don't rest on their
laurels and think that they can continue to push cars with 250%+ higher
defect rates than comparable Japanese cars. 

I'm a management/new product development consultant and one thing you 
learn
to prize in this business is customer feedback - but its not easy to
provide feedback to Porsche management and engineers; this is the only
forum I know for a public discussion on a subject that we are all 
concerned
about and many of whom have a vested interest in. I think it would be
really nice if someone in Stuttgart was subscribing to this email list 
and
providing this feedback to the engineers and production people at Valmet
and Zuffenhausen (but of course I suspect that is just a dream).

First let me explain where I'm coming from - I've almost always owned
Japanese cars and they have all been virtually trouble free.  My current
Acura is 7 years old and even with over 130,000 miles the only work I've
done on it is standard maintenance and regular replacement of Oil and 
Gas -
and I'm known amoung my friends as one who beats the hell out of his 
cars.
I go through tires much faster than everyone else I know and love to
exercise the 4-wheel drifting skills I learned in Bob Bondurants racing
classes. I don't know about you but I've gotten real used to cars that 
just
RUN, and are trouble free, and have good performance.  The Japanese have
shown me that I don't have to sacrifice performance and economy for
reliability.  Good engineering and production can provide all this and
more. Now, for the first time, I'm purchasing a German car - but with 
some
trepidation.  The question is, will I be able to beat on this car with 
the
same level of enthusiasm with the same impunity I've enjoyed with my 
Acura.

I'm buying a Boxster because I want more performance, with a convertible
for the Northern California sun. Right now the only other choices I've
seriously considered are the NSX and the M3 Convertible - but since both 
of
these body styles are near the end of their product life cycle I don't 
want
to jump on that train. I love the looks of the Boxster and believe I 
will
like the performance.  My concern are the JD Powers Initial Quality 
Survey
reports that show the Boxster having 300% higher defect rates than the
average Japanese manufacturers.  I have many friends who have purchased 
new
BMWs and Porsches in the past two years and they have all spend what I
would consider an inordinate amount of time visiting their dealers to 
get
electrical problems and minor mechanical problems sorted out and fixed.
Sure they're covered by their warranties, but fundamentally its
unacceptable for cars to cost this much and have that many problems when
cars that cost 1/3rd the price have much lower defect rates.  Right now
there really isn't much in the way of competition to the Boxster so we 
all
suffer - but things do change.

After my last comments I got the following comment from one other 
subscriber:

"Why did I sell the Boxster?  Well, the idiot light kept coming on, and
although they fixed the problem, there were other, just small things 
(the
fit of the top, the inexperience of the dealer, etc.).  But the big 
thing I
think was knowing that the 911 was so much more powerful...I wanted 
that. "

What does this user mention first and foremost?  Quality issues - and If
you read through pete's discussion board at http://www.boxster.org 
you'll
see that these problems are not uncommon.  Of course people also tend to
talk more about bad news than good news - so my concerns may be 
overblown.
But the JD Powers surveys indicated that 60% of new Boxster owners 
reported
problems - and for me thats just too high.

Perhaps Acura NSXs have the same problems (or Lexus SC400s, or Nissan 
300ZX
Turbos or Toyota Supras) but I suspect not - thus suggesting that 
expensive
sports cars don't have to be a pain in the ass to own.  My brother and
cousins have experienced the "joys" of Jaguar ownership and have no 
desire
to go back to that level of maintenance! Porsche risks becoming the
"Jaguar" of the 90s if it doesn't get closer to the Japanese in terms of
quality.  Jaguar has always had beautiful, well-handling cars - but they
were also a relative bitch to keep up and running.

Leo - I have no problem with it if you are happy trading off earlier
availiability for more defects/problems.  Thats an individual choice - 
but
I just hope that people make that choice with their eyes open; that they
realize that by purchasing a new production run they are taking a higher
level of risk in terms of reliability.  I personally don't think that 
you
should have to make that trade off.

Nope, JD Powers is the leading worldwide Auto Market Research firm - see

Leo,

Thats a nice theory, but unfortunately it doesn't hold true in the real
world.  If you look at IQSs (Initial Quality Surveys) on Japanese luxury
cars they are still significantly higher than the luxury car 
manufacturers
in Germany.  The Japanes simply have been much more effective at
implementing a car development and manufacturing system called "Lean
production".  My hope is that emails like this get to Zuffenhausen that
Porsche will push a little harder at implementing the same processes to 
get
more competitive quality levels.

>
>Leo

I agree - but my hope is one day that I don't need to have two cars; one
for daily driving, and one for nice weekends.  I'm going to be watching
very closely to see how the new Honda/Acura SSX sports car turns out, 
(as
well as the next generation NSX) .  Its being built in the Acura NSX
factory and with 220 HP and low weight it seems guaranteed to have the
performance and reliability that I'm looking for.  The only question is
weather it will be anywhere as beautifully designed as the Boxster - 
from
early spy photos it looks like they won't be - but there is always hope
that Honda will get their act together.

In summary please don't take these as flames for a car most of the
subscribers here love - I share that passion.  But just because you have
passion for something doesn't preclude the ability to offer an honest
appraisal of its strengths and weaknesses.  All the data I've seen 
supports
the idea that Porsche has a significant way to go on Quality - and I'm 
just
hoping that Porsche doesn't lose sight of this fact while orders are 
huge
and backlogs building.  I hope they've learned from the 80s that these
backlogs can dissipate rapidly if economies falter or competition phases 
in
better products.

That said, I'm dropping this topic. 

Brian.
