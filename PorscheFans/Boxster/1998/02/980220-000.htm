Changes made to the Boxster since its introduction:

New vehicles are equipped with 1 to 2 mm smaller diameter spring hose 
clamps as of May 15, 1997 production.
Engines as of Model Year '98 (W) have a modified routing of the coolant 
bleeder pipe from engine to coolant reservoir. The bleeder pipe will no 
longer be connected to the top engine coolant housing connection. The new 
bleeder line will be a hose that is connected to the top of the oil cooler 
assembly. The new hose is routed around the starter motor and connects to 
the coolant reservoir coupling hose. The connection and fastening of the 
hose will be made with the spring-type hose clamps.
As of February 10, 1997, production and engine number 65V 04654, a modified 
fuel pressure regulator and fuel return line are installed.
As of 4/23/97, from Engine Number 65 V 09399 Bosch FR 7 LDC4 or Beru 14 FR 
7 LDU spark plugs will be used
The new front brake pad was introduced into production as of April 3, 1997 
from VIN: 98X VS 622804.
The wiring connections for the belt buckles have been corrected as of VIN 
WPOCA2983WS620157 and the belt buckles as of VIN WPOCA298XWS620138.
Improved guiding of the top as of January 14, 1997: Longer slider, Pulling 
strips with piping on the top material have extended on the top. The 
elastic strip on the top has been deleted.
Additional changes as of July 2, 1997: Elongated hole for the slider guide 
was increased by 0.7 mm to 11.5 mm. Surface areas on the slider area of the 
elongated hole have been ground to eliminate damage to the slide foil.
