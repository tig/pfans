Another interesting story...
------------------------------------------------------
Never let it be said that the wealthy lack imagination. 

Take the American rancher who wanted his Porsche 911 sports car 
fitted with hides from his herd. Or the sheik who had his 911 
painted the color of a desert sunrise. 

That's just the tip of the car-customization iceberg. Beneath 
the surface lies a growing segment of up-market consumers who, 
in a world of cookie-cutter cars, are willing to pay a premium 
to stand out. 


"People naturally want to be different from others, " says Porsche's 
Rolf Sprenger, who started his company's custom program, called 
Exclusive, in 1976. "Ask them and you'll find that nearly every 
customer wants a handmade suit of a car. "


We're talking custom colors, custom leathers, custom wood inlays 
and uncustomary requests ranging from refrigerators to easy-access 
compartments for revolvers. 


Three German manufacturers posting record U.S. sales -- Porsche, 
Mercedes-Benz and BMW -- feel the time is right to play tailor 
to Americans enjoying a robust economy. 


Porsche plans to give all its U.S. dealers Exclusive sales kits; 
50% have them now. Mercedes-Benz plans an August U.S. launch of 
its Designo program. And BMW is studying how to introduce Individual. 


Porsche says the average Exclusive customer spends half the car's 
$ 70,000 value on custom options. The elite spend three times the 
car's price tag; that's a world of solid-gold gearshift knobs 
and hubcap centers. 


In the instance where the sheik wanted a custom color, Porsche 
worked with paint maker BASF to come up with an orange that changed 
shades with the angle of the sun. Such requests can run around 
$ 50,000, 15 times the average special paint cost. 


In the USA, 76% of Porsche 911 customers and 42% of Boxster
buyers, 
another Porsche model, choose at least one Exclusive item --
logo-embossed 
leather seats ($ 194) or carbon-fiber interiors ($ 813) -- says 
Richard Ford of Porsche Cars North America. 


Mercedes' Designo (launched in 1995) and BMW's Individual (started 
in 1991) were born after years of acceding to custom requests. 
Executives from the two companies, which each sell about 100,000 
cars a year in the USA (Porsche sells about 12,000), estimate 
5% of their U.S. buyers will spend from $ 4,000 to $ 10,000 on custom 
options, around one-tenth of the car's value. 


"It'll go higher than 5%, " predicts Chris Cedergren of Nextrend 
auto consultants. "These are not commodity purchases. Here we 
are really in an image business. "


Cedergren says his Los Angeles commute is choked with high-end 
European cruisers, and any chance to make one stand out from the 
next would be welcomed -- even by him. He's looking to paint his 
next 7-series BMW a special color. 


"It costs about $ 5,000 more. But if the color is cool enough, 
I'd consider it, " he says. "This car is your fashion statement. "


But Peter Brown, editor of Automotive News, says that while 
customization is necessary in a country such as Germany where 
taxi cabs are Mercedes E-class sedans, it is redundant in the 
USA. "These cars are still in the minority here. And the monied 
class in America wants a dignified European car. "


Besides, he says adding 10% to the cost of a car through custom 
options runs counter to Mercedes' current lure: value. 


The automakers seem relatively sure their customers will pay. 
But will they wait? All admit their biggest challenge is reducing 
the amount of time between ordering a customized car and delivering 
it to the USA: from weeks to months. 


Still, some industry experts think that if the 1980s were defined 
by the Japanese notion of customer service (you bought whatever 
was available), the coming millennium will mark a return to the 
1950s, with custom ordering par for the course. 


"We've come a long way, " says Rich Brekus, product planning 
manager for BMW North America. "From 'Here's the car, take it 
or leave it', to 'I'd like a few options.' And finally to 'I'd 
like my car to have the color of my wife's shoes.' "


There are some similarities among the custom programs. Each has 
a few dozen specially trained employees (often earning 20% more 
than average) to do everything from hand-stitching leather steering 
wheels to gluing leather to undulating plastic dashboards. 


Each manufacturer also can supply these custom parts to the assembly 
line in time for installation. Such efficiency coupled with higher 
margins create greater profits on custom cars. Only on rare occasions 
are cars pulled from the line, usually when items such as TVs 
and fax machines are involved. 


And all agree on some cultural revelations. Americans go for lighter 
colors, given the strength of the sun over much of the USA. Italians, 
not as wild and crazy as one would think, go for dark hues. And 
conservative Germans are the boldest, often opting for yellow 
interiors and purple exteriors. 


Such expression can be risky. At BMW's Individual headquarters 
near Munich, sales director Peter Locker recalls some strange 
orders. 


Artist David Hockney had the passenger seat of his 850iL converted 
into a doggie water-dispenser for his two dachshunds. Designer 
Karl Lagerfeld ordered a car to match the silver and red interior 
of a Berlin hotel lobby he had just designed. 


Locker recalls saying more than once, "If you order that car, 
it will be yours for the rest of your life. "
