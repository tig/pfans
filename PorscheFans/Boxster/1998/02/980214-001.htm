June in Germany would be great.   I'm sure picking up a car at
Zuffenhausen is a real kick any time but it's even more special if you
can do it w/a club visit. If you are a PCA member, you might try
communicating w/the Marketing Service office, P Club Coordination, in
Ludwigsburg. Ilse Nadele headed that office up for yrs, semi-retired
last, always did a great job and would respond to corespondence from
PCA'rs.  Point is, there are other clubs going through  @ different
times through the year - last trip I was fortunate to be able to tag
along w/the Finnish club, very nice group.
A club factory tour is more extensive, lunch @ Porsche Casino is neat,
hot laps in the afternoon @ Weisach is great fun. Driving Germany in a
new car is super, there's too much to say about it, I wouldn't know
where to start (except drive Nurbering).
Can't say what they do now but a couple yrs ago Reno would send out
Touist D info on request, then after your order was in you'ld get a
whole package of stuff. I'm definately high on the whole experience &
tenatively plan on doing it again in 2000.   Gregg
