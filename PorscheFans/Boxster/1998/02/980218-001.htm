The major sympton of my engine failure was a total loss of compression. The
cause might have been the carbon deposits they found on the valves of
several cylinders or it might have been that the oil was completely washed
from the cylinder walls by gasoline. I think it was probably some
combination of the two. The whole truth may never be known since the engine
went back home to the Creator.

Incidentally, up to that point, the engine and the car in general, gave me
absolutely no problems. I broke a cup holder and they had to adjust the soft
top channel on the passenger side but that was it. I remain very impressed
with the car. Of course, now I have a new, improved 1998 engine so it should
be even better.
