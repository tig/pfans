Hello everyone,

Thanks to all of those replying on the Tow-Truck issue.

At the end I didn't need the car to be towed!! :)

The tow truck guy told me that it seemed that the engine was cranking
really slow.  So he told me to try starting it while depressing the
accelerator.  
After a few tries(10?) the engine jumped to life.  A lot of smoke came
out and he told me to keep accelerating for a little bit.  

I asked him what it was and he told me that the gasoline had frozen. 
That leaving the car still for 2 weeks in really cold weather could do
that as the gas would be completely still.  He said that moisture in
the tank would freeze.  

Could this be true?  I have never heard of such.  And I have left
other cars parked in the same garage for longer periods of time during
the New England Winter.

He also told me to add some kind of additive in the tank before I left
the car parked for extended periods of time in the cold.  
I don't feel comfortable pouring anything else but 93-Octane in the
tank.....

And after reading the email about the replaced engine, I am worried
about mine, having started it while depressing the accelerator.  Is
this really bad to an injection engine?
And if so, why?

Should I go and get my engine/tank checked?  

The car runs(seems to) fine since then.  

Thanks,

Alberto.
