Take a look in you manual.  Your car should never be towed it should
always be put on a flat bed.  If you think you might scratch you bumpers
getting your car on to a flat bed, just try dragging it behind a truck
at a 45 degree angle while going over bumps.  You should have roadside
service (comes with the car), and they tell you right over the phone
that they only send flatbed trucks out (I speak from experience, I had a
injector relay go out when my car was 3 weeks old).

>Hi Everyone,
>
>The starter of my Boxster seems to be faulty.  
>My car won't start.  I tried jumpstarting it but to no avail.
>
>I heard there is a way to get the starter going by getting the vehicle
>in motion, engaging the clutch and then disengaging it.  Is this true?

>
>And if I don't get it started I will have to tow the car to the dealer.
>
>One tow-guy told me that I should never use a "flat-bed" tow truck
>because I would scratch the front/rear bumpers.  
>What kind of tow trucks are best for low cars like ours?

>Help!

>Thanks,
