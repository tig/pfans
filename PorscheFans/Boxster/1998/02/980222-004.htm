And lastly, a good story on the Boxster
...............................................

The Porsche for the rest of us 

Hey! What kind of car is that? " That was an often-heard hail
during my time with the Porsche Boxster. This powerful
two-seater combines an aggressive look suggestive of early
Corvettes together with a modern sleekness. Not a common
site on the road - it is wildly back ordered and not a
high-volume car to begin with - the Boxster solicited waves
and thumbs up from other Porsche drivers, approving looks
from sports-car owners, and caused a small riot at the garage
where I park in the morning. 

Small wonder. The Boxster's 201hp six-cylinder
aluminum-alloy engine pushes the car to a top speed
somewhere north of 150 mph. With the horizontally opposed
power plant mounted in the middle of the chassis and behind
the driver, the balance is near perfect. This puts the Boxster in
its element when it is whizzing through tight corners. 

Indeed, there's nothing quite like taking a deserted cloverleaf at
75 mph in the 2,822-lb roadster with no hint of the tires
breaking free. To understand how the lightweight Boxster
manages this kind of performance, we put it on the hoist at the
service establishment run by my mechanic, Eric. 

A look beneath gives a good view of the cat's cast-aluminum
chassis components, including the transverse control arms,
longitudinal arms, and subframe. Of particular note is the design
of the axles, a variant of a scheme devised for the Porsche 928.
When the Boxster goes into a turn, its flexibly mounted axles
respond to the lateral force by providing more toe-in to both
front and rear wheels. This increases understeer and stability,
minimizing the car's reaction to dynamic loading. 

The result is a wonderful cornering ability - but there is a price.
Tires are likely to wear out much more quickly on the Boxster
than on the family sedan. Veteran Porsche owners are familiar
with this phenomenon. But as the Boxster is meant for a
broader class of car buyer, its tire wear is a point worth
emphasizing, especially since tires for the sure-footed Boxster
cannot be considered inexpensive. The model we tested was
decked out with a sport package that includes low-profile
17-in. wheels, putting a nearly 9-in.-wide tire footprint on the
road. The standard model comes with 16-in. wheels. 

On its belly, the Boxster carries a plastic cover that probably
provides corrosion protection while enhancing the car's ground
effect. Plastic deflectors extending beneath this already low car
(clearance from the floorpan to the ground measures 6.25 in.)
divert air into the front disc brakes for cooling. My mechanic
noted that these will also funnel salt, dirt, and other debris into
the brakes as well, but a strategically placed cover provides
scraping action to keep most of this material from causing
problems. 

The Boxster engine and cooling system boasts several
innovations, including a split radiator mounted in front of the
wheels and a fan mounted inside the right-side air scoop. But
getting a look at the 2.5-liter, six-cylinder screamer proved to
be frustrating. Neither I nor my mechanic could figure out how
to get into the engine compartment. Popping the trunk revealed
the oil dipstick and caps for adding oil and water, but nothing
more. Beneath the trunk's carpeting was nothing but sheet
metal. Nor was the owner's manual any help. 

The mystery was solved the next day with a call to a local
Porsche service manager. "When you put the top half way up, it
gives you access to a panel that is about 2 ft wide, " he
explained cheerfully. "You can get at the alternator or
compressor that way. The spark plugs, oil, and filter are
changed from beneath the car. " 

"You...put the top half way up...to work on the car? " I
stammered. 

Probably taking note of my dumbfoundedness, he continued,
"People think this thing is a nightmare to work on, but it's really
not that bad. It's got all-hydraulic lifters, so they don't need
adjustments like the older 911s with their mechanical valves. It
goes 15,000 miles before its first scheduled service. And if you
ever do have to drop the engine, it comes out easily. " 

Eric and I had figured out at least that much. Six bolts hold on a
beefy-looking aluminum structural plate that sits beneath the
engine and muffler. Yanking this plate, and then the muffler,
gives access to the transmission. The engine mounting seems
straightforward as well. 

Nevertheless, when the Boxster reaches the point in its life
cycle when major work is in order, the job is probably not one
for the untrained backyard mechanic. Highly recommended
tools include a hydraulic lift to get underneath the car and to
gently cushion the engine as it comes away from the chassis.
Nor does the image of the aluminum and steel-alloy engine in
pieces on a garage floor, or the prospect of getting the whole
assembly sealed afterward, sound particularly appealing. 

The bottom line: Enjoy the cornering, buy the tires, and realize
that almost all maintenance and repair necessitates a
well-equipped shop. 

The model we drove included options of leather seats ($
1,951), floor mats ($ 90), and a sport package consisting of
17-in. wheels, a superb stereo system, CD player, alarm, wind
deflector, cruise control, more rigidly tuned springs, and
traction control ($ 3,235). Along with a $ 765 destination
charge, this brought the total to $ 47,657 from a base price of
$ 39,980. 

- Lee Teschler 

The 1997 Boxster is just one more example of the Porsche
tradition of combining high class with high performance. It
seems all their cars inspire awe and that holds true for the
Boxster. Our test model was a zenith-blue ragtop and it did
nothing but turn heads for an entire week. If nothing else, I think
we should get a kickback from all of the chiropractors we kept
in business. 

I quickly hopped in the cockpit as soon as I could safely sneak
out of the office. A Porsche tradition - the ignition mounted on
the left side of the steering column - I find amusing as I try
coordinating my left hand to start the car. A turn of the key got
the 2.5-liter engine purring. It is definitely not a muscle car, but
hey, besides the 928, no Porsches are. Besides, this car still has
201 hp, which is plenty for a car weighing in at only 2,822 lb. 

Next, I took the top down. And I'm happy to report that it's the
easiest convertible I've ever operated. Using one hand, you
simply push a large centermounted release button and pull
down the surrounding ring-shaped hinge. Then push a
dash-mounted button and in a mere 12 sec the top neatly tucks
itself under the rear deck. No long reaches to unlatch locks and
no covers to install - take heed Detroit, we could use more
designs like this. 

The twin bucket Recaro seats offer plenty of support and
comfort. The backrest has electric adjustments, while fore and
aft adjustments are manual. There is also a manual height
adjustment. And the steering wheel doesn't tilt up and down,
instead it telescopes in and out. 

Once comfortably settled in, I studied the gauges. The graphics
are a pleasant departure from those calculator-style LEDs and
Courier-style numbers used by most automakers. The italicized
numbers on Boxster's speedometer and tach look like they
were painted on with a brush. Boxster literature explains that
the typography is the same as that used for model designations
on the back of Porsches. 

It was a challenge, however, to adjust to a speedometer with
increments of 25 mph, and it's the left-most dial in the slightly
overlapping cluster of gauges. Fortunately, speed can also be
read off of a digital display in the center-mounted tachometer. 

I typically set the radio stations prior to driving a test car so that
I can thoroughly and safely enjoy the ride. But understanding
the Boxster's six-speaker stereo and CD player controls was
like deciphering Sanskrit. It has many different options and
features, but their markings and labels are German in design
and each button's function isn't obvious. The same goes for the
digital climate controls. 

With the engine all warmed up, I made my way out of the
parking garage. As I remembered from the 911 we previously
tested, Porsche clutches are touchy. Putting my male ego aside,
I'll admit I stalled it - once. After I got used to the high release
and freeplay of the Boxster clutch, I actually enjoyed it. You
just have to adjust your seat back a notch and keep telling
yourself not to push the clutch through the firewall. 

On the open road, the Boxster feels and sounds like pure
German engineering as it hugs the corners with amazing
stability. Once engine revs reach the mid-4,000s, the engine
begins emanating a throaty drone, letting you know it's gasping
for air while bringing the car to performance peaks. I've never
driven a car that has felt as balanced as this one. The ride is
surprisingly comfortable, considering how tightly the suspension
is tuned. Abrupt bumps in the road are felt somewhat through
the steering wheel but, amazingly, aren't transmitted through the
seats, saving riders from a bone-jarring experience. Even when
accelerating over bumps during lane changes, the 17-in. tires
rebound quickly back to the road without skirting the rear
wheels to the side. 

One advantage of a mid-mounted engine is it has two trunks, a
must for a two-seater. There is plenty of cargo room for those
weekend trips, but don't expect to take it Christmas shopping. I
was able to get two or three mediumsized bags in the front
trunk, but had to wrestle with my golf clubs to jam the head of
my driver into the rear trunk. Ride noise in the cabin with the
top down is comfortable, even at high speeds. Wind buffeting is
minimized by a deflector mounted behind the headrests. 

I tried to match the marks set on the Boxster spec sheets by
running a couple of 0 to 60's. Alone in the car, I couldn't
accurately time myself, but it felt pretty quick and trust it was
under 7 sec. The 100-mph mark also comes up very quickly,
and I frequently dropped the Porsche into third gear at highway
speeds to break the century mark, and more. 

There are only two things missing from the Porsche: automatic
powerdown windows, which I can live without, and low-end
torque that throws you back in the seat. I'll give up the thrust
until someone builds a muscle car that hugs the road like the
Boxster.
