After much research and consulting I took the Boxster in.

The guys at the Car Shop (Pompano Beach, FL)  took off my virgin door panels
(l  have dash speakers but not door speakers) and, after having worked on
Boxsters with the factory doors speakers, realized that I have more room than
the upgraded doors!  YES ! ! !

Hence, I'm putting the ubiquitous MB Quart 4" and tweeter in the dash and an
8" woofer in the door.  He feels an 8" woofer with the passive cross-over will
provide great bass response. No cutting of metal is necessary; the only
drawback is the speaker will cross the line in the door demarcating the
leather/vinyl from the carpet.  It will look like an aftermarket system as
opposed to a nice neat unit from Tech Art, etc.  I'll live.

The amp is an Acoustic 2 channel with 100 w/ch into 4 ohms.  The head unit is
an Alpine CDA 7832 in dash CD.  I may install the Alpine 12 disc CD changer
later on.  I usually change discs no more than twice while on the way to work
so this is not that important.  I might get the changer just to keep the
cockpit from becoming cluttered with jewel boxes.
