ok 2 things... a) the release cable your thinking of is is the one that is
found when you open the passenger door... there is a little ring connected to a
cable... it is at about the height of the mirror... eitherways.. this is NOT
the cable for the trunk... it is the emergency release for the gas tank... b)
the question of the trunks being mechanical ... the trunk is likely mechanical
the problem is in the lock... the lock is electrical... being part of the
central locking system... the central locking system locks the latches in
place... hence the latch will move but it wont go far enuff to open the
trunk... as far as the location of the emergency release for the front trunk it
is a security issue hence i will not disclose it here... but let me assure you
it takes some work to get at it... including removing a wheel and some
panels... its not so easy to get to as it rightly shouldnt.
