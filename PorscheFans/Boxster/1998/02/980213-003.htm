To all Boxster Owners,

The March issue of PML, The Market Letter for Porsche Automobiles, is our
Boxster issue. Along with our normal pricing analysis, we would like to
include the comments of current Boxster owners... likes, dislikes, things you
would change, how you acquired your car, your thoughts on Porsches being built
in Finland, anything you'd like to include. We will publish as many comments
as possible in our March issue which will mail about 3/10/98 (we would like to
credit you for your comments and also mail you a copy of the issue). Please
forward your comments as soon as possible to PMLetter@aol.com or
PMLAdmin@aol.com. Check our web (www.pmletter.com) page if you haven't seen or
heard of PML before. Thanks!

Your help is appreciated.

Regards,

Phil & Pat Van Buskirk, owners
.
