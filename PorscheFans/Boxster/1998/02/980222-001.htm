An excerpt from a recent Autoweek mag, forwarded by a friend, thought you
might enjoy it:

PORSCHE BOXSTER MILES OF SMILES:
OUR PORSCHE'S ALMOST PERFECT   

First-quarter report. Miles driven: 9936. Average fuel mileage:
24.1 mpg. Service: Install Pirelli WP210 tires (205/50R-17 fronts
at $178 each, 225/50R-17 rears at $198 each, plus $64
installation), $816. 

Let's get this said right up front: Our long-term Porsche Boxster
isn't perfect. The windshield washer misses an area in the driver's
line of vision. One of the seams on the convertible top needs
attention when we take the car in for its 15,000-mile service.
Some trim pieces have come loose, but we've been able to snap
them back in place-which is more than we can say about the
flimsy cupholders, which staffers have broken in their impatience
to move them out of the way of the air vents they block. 

Otherwise, our built-in-Zuffenhausen Boxster is a car to covet, a
fun-behindthe-wheel machine that we've driven on trips from
Detroit to Milwaukee and from Michigan to Florida. 

The water-cooled six (201 horsepower, 181 lb-ft) is sweet, and
pulls all the way to the red zone, but it also returns more than 30
mpg on the interstates. The steering/suspension/chassis
combination is incredibly responsive and well-balanced-once you
get the hang of the clutch's pickup (first-time drivers tend to stall
the engine a couple of times until their learning curve matches the
torque curve). 

With its engine mid-mounted, the Boxster offers two trunks.
There's enough luggage room for long road trips-with space left
over to haul home souvenirs, such as the six bags of fresh Florida
grapefruit that brought some sunshine to the Midwestern winter. 

The top operates easily, there's no boot to mess with when the
top's down, and the wind blocker keeps the cabin calm on the
interstates. Cabin comfort is enhanced by such nice design
features as a driver's door that's contoured to provide an extra
armrest that's higher than the door handle and lower than the
window sill. The seats are easy to adjust and have good lumbar
support. We weren't tired or uncomfortable even after 350
non-stop miles at the wheel, which we found to be about the
maximum practical range for a tank of fuel. 

We suspect that many Boxster owners living in the Snow Belt will
park their cars for the winter. 

We won't. Our Boxster has ABD (automatic brake differential),
and now that we've equipped it with Pirelli winter treads, we've
discovered that the car's mid-engine balance turns a sports car
into a great snowmobile-just watch the ground clearance.
