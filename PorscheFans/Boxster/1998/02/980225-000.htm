I have the same problem, and have no idea what it is.  The dealer said
it was an attribute of the car and all Boxsters do it.  I find that hard
to believe.  It's such a loud noise that I can't believe it's not a
defect.  Moreover, if every Boxster did it I would think we would think
we would have been reading about it here, at Porsche Pete's or at
Boxster dot org.



> A fellow Boxster owner has asked  me to post this question.   He has a loud> noise when the car is backing up and the wheel is turned full to the left or right.  Has anyone else had this problem and how did the dealer fix the problem?
