 picked her up yesterday afternnoon with MB Quart dash 4" and tweeter and 8"
woofers in the doors; Acoustic 2 ch amp 100w/ch into 4ohms, and the Alpine
head.

The upgrade is a major difference from what I had...as expected.  The
prominent bass response and the clarity or separation are the major
improvements. The dash high end is a bit harsh or brittle so I had to turn the
treble down -2 or -3 (in comparison to my Honda with an Alpine head and
factory speakers with the treble at +7 and still lacking in high end).  The
first cut on Electric Ladyland with its prodigious bass was, pun not intended,
an experience.  Van Halen, Sheryl Crow, and others sound very good.  My Marcus
Miller CD probably set off seismic detectors in California (I am in Florida).

HIndsight is always 20:20.

More amp power would be nice but I fear that trying to complete with the
engine could hurt my ears...seriously. I was in a couple of bands in college
and during my residency and have very mild hearing loss due to cranked amps
and everybody turning up a little more to be heard.  But I'll probably go for
the extra one day anyway !   LOL !

A subwoofer would have made the biggest difference.   I'll get one eventually.
The shop did work on another Boxster and fit an 8" JL Audio sub with a custom
fiberglass enclosure into the passenger kick panel with minimal loss of
footwell space.  The sub enclosure, labor, and a second amp will cost just
under a grand.

Rear speakers would be nice but there is plenty of fill from the front and
doors.  The guys at the shop could put a pair of 4" speakers in the "useless"
storage compartment above the engine.  That will come last, if at all.  But it
probably will occur.  Ah, tempation.
