After a year of ownership and 15,000+ miles I sold my Boxster.
I actually made money, selling the car for more than I paid for it. {touch
wood!}

While not without its' foibles, I found the Boxster to be a thoroughly
enjoyable automobile.  Always FUN to drive, and great to look at.  [At the
same time, must admit, withdrawal symptoms have been detected.]

It's been interesting keeping up with developments here on the list,
exchanging information between fellow enthusiasts.  Valuable (sic useful) data
on sometimes minor occurrences made the shared experience all the more
enjoyable.  Thanks for your participation, I learned a great deal.

I'm asked, "What are you gonna' get now?"  
Seriously thinking about ordering another one, maybe Euro delivery for late
Fall this year.  Not an "S", just stick with the standard issue car (it's
plenty enough).  Probably get the same color combination, maybe add a few
options (that weren't available when I ordered years ago), but exactly the
same car.
[I've even gone so far as to inquire about certain details for picking up a
car in Stuttgart.  Did you know that all Porsche Euro delivery cars come
WITHOUT the cosmoline?!  GREAT!  They use Schenker for freight forwarding all
Porsches to the U.S..  And there is NO discount for Euro delivery of ANY
Porsche anymore.]

Y'all be good and keep the shiny side up!
