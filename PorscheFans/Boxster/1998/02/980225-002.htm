Hi,
  I just saw an excellent idea on the Boxster Board the other day.  It
provided information on another way for Boxster enthusiasts to communicate
with each other using Instant Messengers.  This message particularity
suggested downloading PeopleLink's IM.  People argue getting ICQ, because
more people use it.  But really this doesn't matter, since you choose who
to chat with.  Anyways, I think this would be a really great idea!  Forums
and mailing digests are great for group input, but I have also been
interested in chatting one on one with others about Boxsters, or Porches in
general.  (Or ANYTHING really :-)  Well, if you're interested in
downloading this Instant Messenger (I personally like the features and
looks of this one better than ICQ), just visit this link: (the one posted
on the Boxster Board) 

http://www.peoplelink.com/cgi-bin/assoc.cgi?pid=716

And yes, as many of you know, it's absolutely FREE, and only takes a couple
minutes to download, so there is really nothing to lose, except for a
couple minutes.  BTW, after you've downloaded it, post your user name here
for others to see.  That way we'll be able to contact you through your IM.
Another cool feature about IMs is that you'll always know when one of your
so called "friends" is online.

Enough of my babbling, just thought I'd emphasize on this idea.  I've been
pleased with it anyways.
