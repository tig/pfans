A friend's 951 was making similar noises at full lock.  After great 
investigation, we found that the anti-roll bar was hanging up slightly
on one of the bushings it attaches to, only at full lock.  Once released
from full lock, it would make a "clang" noise as it became un-hung.  This
seems to be common on many cars.  His has made this noise, on and off for
three years now with no problems.

I would not leave a noise in the front suspension unattended though.  
Until you guys know exactly what it is, don't ignore it.  Another 951
owner I know had a similar clang, it turned out to be his ball joints
being severely worn.
