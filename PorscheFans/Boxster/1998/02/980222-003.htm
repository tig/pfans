More news on Boxsters...

Udderly amazing. 

Those with $40,000 to spend on a 1998 Porsche Boxster
roadster will have to bide their time--for about a year--thanks to a
problem on the assembly line. 

The cows won't cooperate. 

Seems the bovines are a bit too thick-skinned. 

"If you're willing to settle for not exactly the car you want, I can get
you a Boxster within four months, " Fred Schwab, executive vice
president of Porsche Cars of North America, said in an interview.
He was in town for a media preview of the 1998 Chicago Auto
Show, which opens Saturday in McCormick Place South. 

"Half our Boxster orders are for a silver exterior and red leather
interior, but it seems the cows that provide the leather don't like
their skin dyed red, and half the hides reject the red dye, " he said. 

Perhaps Porsche should have offered camel cloth.
