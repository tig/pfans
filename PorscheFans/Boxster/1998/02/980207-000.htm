A) the tow-guy is 100% wrong... you should ONLY tow it on a flat-bed... if you
dont.. chances are youll fuck up your suspension among other things...
scratched front and rear ends would be a prize in comparison... 

B) you shouldnt have it towed yourself... call roadside assistance... have them
send a tow truck... plus the car should be strapped down w/ nylon bands... not
chains...when the roadside assistance sent truck towed mine the bastard used
chains... nothing happened but if something is to surface i made my complaint
to customer assistance its noted somewhere they will be required to repair
it... which brings me to another point.. roadside assistance will cover first
100miles of the tow plus will guarantee the quality... i.e. if the car is
fucked up in any way... they have to warrantee it. You shouldnt have it towed
yourself... period.

C) dont know bout that vehicle in motion bit.

D) go to your dealer and get the CHARGE-O-MATIC... sounds like you holed up
your car for a few weeks and the battery just died completely... this will
prevent this from occuring again... but it might also be able to give you enuff
of a charge going to let you turn over the starter and let it run for a bit to
recharge the battery. cost of the Charge-o-matic is like 70-80 bux.
