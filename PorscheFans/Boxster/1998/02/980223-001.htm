DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 7 

BODY: 
    "Automobile Magazine " today announced the  Porsche Boxster was
selected its 1998 Automobile of the Year. In presenting  the award at a
press conference in conjunction with the North American  International
Auto Show in Detroit, "Automobile Magazine " Editor and  Publication
Director, David E. Davis, Jr., stated, "'Automobile Magazine' is a
 celebration of great cars -- great cars with a definite enthusiast skew. We
 evaluated some wonderful sedans and sport utility vehicles this year, but
the  Boxster turned out to be a great sports car, a great Porsche, and a
great  value for the enthusiast owner. It's our kind of car! " 

The award, itself, is an impressive cast bronze trophy created by noted
 sculptor Richard Pietruska of Pasadena, California. 

In its January 1998 issue, "Car and Driver " magazine named the Boxster
one  of the 10 Best Cars of 1998. When choosing the model in the 16th
annual  competition, "Car and Driver " Editor-In-Chief, Csaba Csere,
wrote, "Couple the  Boxster's performance with the pleasure of a
convertible top, which is  particularly rapid acting and easy to use, as well
as the practicality of  front and rear trunks, the exhilaration of race-bred
handling, and the  glorious beauty of its show-car-inspired lines, and you
have one of the most  desirable cars of the year. "

These awards represent the most recent laurels the Boxster has received
 since its introduction to the North American market in January of 1997.
Last  fall, the Automotive Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC)
acknowledged the  Boxster as the Best New Sports Car and Best New
Design for 1998. Earlier, the  staff of television's nationally syndicated
automotive program, "MotorWeek, " selected the Boxster as the 1997
"MotorWeek " Drivers' Choice Award winner for  Best Sports Car. 

The mid-engine, two-seat Boxster roadster is Porsche's first all-new
 sports car in 19 years. It is equipped with a 201-horsepower, 2.5-liter,
 liquid-cooled boxer engine, five-speed manual or five speed Tiptronic S
 automatic transmission, four-wheel independent suspension and
four-wheel disc  brakes with ABS. Its folding convertible top can be
electrically opened or  closed in 12 seconds. 

The Boxster has not only earned critical acclaim from the automotive
 press, it has also received an enthusiastic response from the public. Sales
 of 6,992 Boxster models in 1997 helped Porsche achieve its best sales
result  in North America since 1988.

And another story about how Porsche got more competitive on its quality...

Twenty years ago, it would have seemed impossible to imagine that the
legendary manufacturer of sports cars, Porsche, would ever admit to the
need to learn from another automaker - particularly a Japanese
automaker. 

But the impossible happened, and enthusiasts are seeing the first products
of that labor in the Boxster and the all-new 911, which will arrive next
spring. 

Faced with unacceptably high manufacturing costs, in 1992 Porsche
decided it needed to drastically change how it develops and builds its cars. 

It also decided it would make those changes and develop two new cars -
the Boxster and the first new 911 in 34 years - at the same time. This was
no small job. The last time Porsche had developed a brand-new car was in
1977, when it produced the 928, a one-car process that took about seven
years. 

But that was not the only challenge. The really interesting part was that
Porsche planned to use a new engineering approach called simultaneous
engineering to accomplish the task. The catch was that Porsche didn't
have a full-fledged, adult-rated simultaneous-engineering process in place. 

Instead, it was still struggling to completely shed the rigid, sequential
system upon which it had relied for decades. Under such a system, various
departments worked separately, and people engineering the vehicle did not
work closely - if at all - with those responsible for manufacturing it. 

Consequently, the time required to develop a new car would be long, often
resulting from the need to make changes. For example, the manufacturing
people might announce that part of the design just finished by the
engineers would be impossible to build easily, sending everyone back to the
drawing boards. 

But using simultaneous engineering, teams would be formed representing
everyone from engineers to accountants to work on various parts of the
vehicle. The idea was to make sure everyone was happy with a design
from the beginning. 

So, Porsche's problem was that it was really looking at a triple threat to
corporate sanity: Designing two cars at the same time, it would also be
working out the process with which to do that. 

Porsche had fiddled with simultaneous engineering to produce the
improved version of the 911, known by the code-name 993, which was
introduced in 1994, according to Horst Marchart, the Porsche director
responsible for research and development. But the automaker needed a
fully developed system for simultaneous engineering and an end to its
expensive, traditional sequential system. 

"We had to dramatically modify our development philosophy, " he said. 

Marchart was aware it would not be easy to juggle all three projects, but
he hoped the task would be possible because Porsche's small size would
allow more flexibility than would be possible in a bigger organization. 

Porsche began researching ways to change its engineering and production
system by studying methods such as BMW's team concept and the
processes used by Nissan and Toyota in Japan. 

One of the shocks had been the Japanese automakers' willingness to show
their processes to Porsche, according to "Lean Thinking, " the 1996 book
by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones. 

"No one in the Japanese auto industry considered us serious competition,
and so they were very open. This was a major affront to our self-image, "
Wendelin Wiedeking, chairman of the management board, told Womack
and Jones. 

Company officials acknowledge that they relied most heavily on the
disciples of the Toyota production method, particularly Yoshiki Iwata and
Chihiro Nakao, who were working for the Shingijutsu consulting group. 

But that was just the beginning. It was clear that as Porsche developed the
cars, the simultaneous engineering process would evolve, too. 

Porsche started with 28 teams of six to eight people each. As expected,
these included representatives from every aspect of the car-making
process, including engineering, suppliers, manufacturing and procurement.
Some of those teams would work on the Boxster, some would work on the
911. Some would work on both. 

The decision on where the teams would work was largely based on shared
components. Early on, Porsche had decided to share as many components
as possible, with the limits largely determined by packaging. 

Porsche officials say 38 percent of the parts were shared, including the
front suspension, steering, brakes and ventilation system. Obviously, the
rear suspension could not be shared, because the Boxster was a midengine
design while the 911 would cling to the traditional rear-engine layout. 

Consequently, one team worked on the front suspension for both the
Boxster and the 911. But there were separate teams for the rear
suspensions. 

There were two teams working on the new water-cooled, six-cylinder
Boxster engine: one working on the "basic engine, " such as the crankshaft
and cylinder head, and the other handling "peripherals " such as cooling
and exhaust. 

As work on the two cars progressed, there were changes to the teams,
including reallocating manpower. For example, the body-in-white team
quickly discovered that there was far too much work for one team, so four
teams were created. 

Also, originally the teams worked without a team leader and decisions
were made by consensus, said Marchart, but that did not work well. 

"In the beginning, we had only common solutions, but we learned very
quickly that was not the best situation, because you get not the best car,
but only a car on a lower level. So, we decided we needed a team leader,
the man who makes the final decision, " he said. 

Also, the teams were not totally in control of their projects. On items such
as suppliers, they could make recommendations, but the final choice was
made by the Porsche board. The teams worked within budgets and had
the power to make many decisions, including shifting money around. But
they were clearly subject to being overruled by outsiders. 

"I would say we have simultaneous engineering, but we have also the
influence of key people in the development process, " Marchart said. 

These key people were thought to have special expertise that gave them
the right and the authority to overrule the teams. Two such areas were
handling and braking, Marchart said. 

Marchart also admitted he was not shy about getting involved.
"Sometimes, I also got into the car and would say, 'No, that is not the right
direction.' I was strongly involved in the process. " He acknowledged that
was not always something that made the teams happy, but sometimes it
did. 

If the teams had problems they could not solve, they had several ways to
get help. One was to ask for assistance from an advisory council,
comprised of the department managers of each of the people on the team.
Another was to talk to the project managers, who had overall control and
supervision of the teams. 

Despite all the problems, changes and stresses, Marchart said the effect
on Porsche was remarkable. Before the process, he said, "We had
isolation and different areas of the company. Development was a closed
circle. Production was a closed circle. Now we are all together with an
integrated process, and we can find the best solution from the beginning. "

The two cars were finished in "well under four years, " according to
Porsche, compared with almost seven years for the 928. The cars were
also finished at the same time, and Porsche could have introduced either
one first. But because of the ongoing sales success of the 993, the Boxster
was launched first. 

There has been a remarkable reduction in the number of changes made
during the development process, the development time and the cost,
Marchart said. 

In 1992, he said it took about 128 hours to build the 964 (the model that
preceded the 993). That was reduced to about 90 hours with the 993, and
it takes less than 70 hours to build the new 996. The Boxster is being built
in less than 50 hours, Marchart said. 

That is why when the new 911 goes on sale in the United States in the
spring, the price is expected to be virtually unchanged, Porsche officials
said. 

There also appears to have been a substantial improvement in quality. In
"Lean Thinking, " Womack and Jones estimated that, using the new
system, defects per vehicle would drop from 100 in 1991 to 25 in 1997. 

"Porsche sees these figures as realistic statistical estimates, " a Porsche
spokesman said recently. 

"It was very difficult, and we had a lot of problems, " Marchart
acknowledged. "But now, the feeling of the people is much better. "
