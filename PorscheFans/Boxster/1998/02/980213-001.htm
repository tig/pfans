Hello Boxsterphiles,

Recently I ordered a 1999 986, arctic silver, black/black/black, with P63
sport package.  My dealer called yesterday to let me know that production is
about to begin and I need to decide by next week whether to take tourist
delivery in June or take delivery here in July.  Unfortunately, my production
window won't allow me to get in on any of the PCNA-sponsored trips (May and
October) or the trips sponsored by Fastlane Travel (April and September).
You'd think June would be a great month for a sponsored trip...

So, I'm considering spending the $1150 plus airfare/lodging/expenses to take
the non-sponsored tourist delivery package.  I know that the fee includes
insurance, plates, and maybe a factory tour, but I can't get much more
information...  

My dealer says he can't get any literature/additional info out of PCNA.  Just
for the hell of it, I called PCNA myself, who referred me back to my dealer
(of course, just like you guys said ;)  I've combed the Porschefans/986
archive.  I checked out the tourist delivery area at Berkeley Johnston's
website, which was the best source of infomation I've found (thanks Berkeley),
but he went on a PCNA-sponsored tour.

So has anyone out there done the non-sponsored tourist delivery thing or know
anything about it?  If so, I'd be much obliged if you could send any info on
the following:  What do I get for my $1150 and is it worth it?  Where is the
best place to stay?  Should I fly straight into Stuttgart?  In June, what
direction should I drive the thing?  Munich, Frankfurt, France,
Austria/Switzerland?  Any other info/experience/$.02 would be great.  Thanks.

Tom
'99 986, silver, black, p63 (soon)
