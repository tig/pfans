Greetings to all Boxster Owners,

Let's throw this question out and see what if any response I get.

When I ordered my Boxster early last year (delivered in July 97) I was not
thrilled by reading the description of Porsche's version of the limited slip
differential.  Basically, when I want to put power down I do not want it to be
consumed by brake pads.  Consequently, I did not select Porsche's traction
control option.

The thought was that I would consider having an aftermarket differential
installed.  From the ads I've seen the only one out there is Quaife
differential.  Has anyone had it installed or have any comments?  Does anyone
know if the LSD portion of a 915 or 950 transmission will fit ?

Thanks,


Mark Gadbois
