There is a confusion in terms -- polishing elswhere does not mean waxing.
It refers to the removal of swirls, etc.  The term "wax" means nothing if
the product does not contain wax. There is even some confusion when you look
at Meguiar products.  When questioned, a Meguiar rep told me they were going
to relabel their products.

Also cannot obtain the "preservative" mentioned in the Owner's Manual.  But
many products mention substances which replenish the "oils" which are lost
by exposure to sun, etc.

The instrument panel guage is accurate if the engine drains overnight -- in
my case, the full mark on the panel corresponds to the dipstick reading.  At
other times, the panel guage reads somewhat lower -- which is better than
reading high (I think!).  Because the engine drains slowly, I think that an
accurate check -- either method -- can be done only after the car has not
been in use for several hours.
