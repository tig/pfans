I'd change it per the manual, not more, not less. If you do _all_ those
"couple hundred miles a month" in one drive, then I'd say that you might
get by with ignoring the manual. But if it takes you several shorter drives
to accumulate those miles, then I'd say go by the book.

The problem with leaving the oil in there that long is that any acid
buildup will eat away at your bearings for several months. You may think
that since you put so few miles on it that it won't matter, and while that
may help, I'd still be leery of waiting so long. All it takes is a short
drive (especially under 10 miles) and you've got water and other exhaust
byproducts in the oil, which then chemically combine to form acids. The
detergent in the oil fights that, as does the crankcase ventilation system,
but they can only help so much.

And yes, you change the oil filter at the same time. Only a few dollars
more, and it sure gives you a good feeling to change it. Plus, then you
won't have to worry so much about the gasket drying out, cracking and
leaking etc.
