on the issue of the waterproofer the product is available from BMW... and used
to be available from Porsche the product from BMW is a whole package...
what Porsche still has is the cleaner... its the same one that comes in the BMW
box... but Porsche doesnt have the Sealer anymore...

the only difference is the label... both companies use the same product
manufacturer
the Product from BMW is the Cabrio-Pflegeset... it also says on the box...
"Original BMW Convertible Care Pack"  it costs like 80-85 bux and covers all
the bases
part number 83-12-9-407-806.

none of the car care products are ever made by the company themselves... they
go out find a good product or one they like and license to sell it...

as far as wax's and glazes... I find Porsche has scraped the bottom of the
barrel...as far wheel care... they have the best... P21S... and the price is
the same... or more... so you might as well which ever is cheaper at the
time.... but be aware that P21S's GEL Cleaner is a more heavy duty cleaner for
more stuck on gunk.

and has ANYONE seen or was lucky enuff to get the paint conditioner?

that stuff was not available for as long as I can remember... I like the idea
of a product keeping the oils in the paint... that will keep the paintjob from
going bland over time.. but where do you get the stuff?
as far as the oil condition is concerned

my service guy keeps trying to push me off of doing it... more often... even
tho I should...
I myself am not sure if thats a good idea... Id love some input myself.
