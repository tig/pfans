Thanks everyone, for your replies.  Sadly I just don't have the time to get
out in the 911.  For business reasons the 911 doesn't suit, and secondly I
just can't have fun in the car while going back & fro in the mundane
traffic.  The car is meant for excitement!

So, I am stuck with driving this car (and another older Dino), when I have
the free time, (So little time for example, I had to miss Sebring and give
away my five day ticket) and that amounts to very little! At least, I did
get to Daytona for the 24 hours. Anyway:

The consensus of opinion is change the filter & oil every six months, and
this is what I will do.  The other unanimous recommendation was to get the
oil up to normal temp to make sure that the condensation is burned off when
I do drive the car.  Mr. Bronson suggested "Your biggest risk will be
condensation with your low mileage.  Getting the engine up to op temp and
keeping it there for at least 30 min when
you do drive it should boil off the little water that will collect.  I
believe that is the considered opinion of all you good folks who responded
to my inquiry.
