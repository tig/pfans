Responding to your inquiry on the Roll Bar for the Boxster,  
I sell first class products for Porsches and I include BreyKrause's Roll Bar
Extension among the products we carry for our customers.  This is my review of
the BreyKrause Roll Bar Extension.

The BreyKrause Boxster Roll Extension

I have seen the extension installed on a Boxster recently and can comment its
appearance is typical of the BreyKrause line up, FIRST CLASS.

Mounting brackets are fabricated from type 304 stainless steel and a cut
perfectly for a non interference fit into the Boxster's factory mounting
points (no added holes, etc...similar to the DAS-sportSYSTEM philosophy.)

It is covered in a tough crinkle black power coat and compliments the interior
accents that Porsche did in balck.

It increases the headroom in the Boxster by an additonal 1 3/4" above the
factory bar and it will not interfere with the soft or hard top.  Made from
type 304 stainless tubing.  

Installation can be done at home, it is quick and simple with the instructions
provided.  Careful engineering and design result in a secure fit that does'nt
damage the car in any way.

Price is $600.00

My PCA region (Riesentoter) is considering buying a bar to be installed and
deinstalled by my shop for the sole purpose of bringing Boxster to the track.
It is sort of a rental/loaner deal and the details have not yet been worked
out (ie cost, r&r labor charge, etc) but possibly your local region could do a
similar program with one of your local shops.  It is intended to get a Boxster
owner a one time use of their car on a track and then become a frequent
"driver" in the regions driver's ed program.  

Good Luck with your Boxster on the track and keep the list up to date with
your experiences,
