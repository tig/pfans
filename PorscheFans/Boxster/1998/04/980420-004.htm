Boxster, especially if I'm entering some local Concours meetings. In
the past, I've used Meguilar products on my cars. Recently I've read
about Zymol and Klasse. Any recommendations would be appreciated.

Two valuable resources for questions about car care are:
	Larry Reynolds of Car Care Specialties at carcaresp@aol.com in Saddle 
Brook NJ 201.796.8300 (this area code may now be 973)
	Donna Paterek of Paterek Prefered (PaterekD@nabisco.com) in Chatham, NJ 
 973-635-0689 phone/fax
Both run mail order businesses selling everything for car cleaning, and 
they offer free write-ups on techniques and product recommendations. 
Without derogation to the Patereks (her husband John is the PCA technical 
advisor on preservation), I've had great service and lots of useful free 
advice from Larry. Call either or both of these people and you'l tap into 
lot's of practical experience with all the products in this space.

I don't know about "the best" but after years of trying lots of different 
products, including Mothers, my personal product choices are Sonax shampoo 
for washing with a good cotton mop glove. I use 3M Glaze for polishing 
twice, or so, a year, followed by Blitz wax which I wipe off long before it 
dries (despite the instructions on the tin). I sometimes use Zymol blue for 
touch up around edges that might otherwise show white dry wax build-up, and 
because I love the smell. I think that Blitz produces as deep a shine and a 
longer lived shell as Zymol at 1/2 the price. The 3M product is as good as 
the Zymol Cleanse, and also a bargain. I use Lexol Vinylex for vinyl and 
rubber seals and Black Again for external trim, such as the spoiler lip.

YMMV.
