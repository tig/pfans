level indicator on the dash is not accurate -- can I trust it or not?"

Yes, I have found on several occasions that the oil level indicator was not
accurate. Just after I got the car last April it went from being fine to
being almost a quart low overnight. I looked for oil leaks and there were
none. It was a new engine so I suspected that it might be using a bit more
than usual. I decided to wait a while before adding a quart since, at the
time, I wasn't carrying a quart of Mobil 1 onboard. Well, the next time I
started the car, the oil level was fine. Made me wonder?  It happened again
after an oil change. Right after the oil change, the level was fine. Two
days later, it was a quart low. Again I waited and again, it was fine on a
subsequent start. It makes you kind of nervous doesn't it??
