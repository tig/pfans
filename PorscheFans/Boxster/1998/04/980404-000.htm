Mr. Stephens wrote of a product that, and I quote:  "it is probably the
best protectant for cab and convertible tops of the type used by
Porsche,
Mercedes, Volvo and Saab.  It waterproofs and more importantly seals the

seams and stitching from degradation."

Does anyone know of the product name, part number that Mr. Stephens is
referring to? I am not sure if it is a Porsch product, Mercedes or
what....

Question for the digest:  A lot of us don't get to drive our cars that
much, me included, and on the subject of changing oil, I would like to
start a thread on that subject:

Given only a couple hundred miles a month on a new 993, I have thought
that
a oil change every six months, and oil filter every year would be
sufficient.  Is that backwards?  Should the filter be changed each time
also?  Providing that the car, when driven is fully warmed up, is a six
month interval considered adequate?  the car resides in a dehumidified
garage in Charleston SC.

Thanks to all,

Steve

Hi Steve,  Just my opinion but doing the oil w/o the filters on the 993
is a 'penny wise lb . . . .'  I've been using the twice a year scenario
(regardless of miles) on my cars for years, the 944 has 150000 on it
w/excellent compression.  As they say, its the cheapest preventative
maintenence.
Best rag top spray preservative product I've run across is the MBenz
Cabrio-Impragnierspray (German)  an 8 oz spray can.
