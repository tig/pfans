Has anyone else experienced this problem? I occasionally have the
following situation:

o Forget to lock the door of my Boxster
o Come back to car and press lock button on key-remote thinking I'm
  unlocking it, but actually locking it
o Try to open door - it is locked
o Swear
o Unlock door with key-remote
o Try to open door - window drops, but door still locked

Sometimes I just have to wait 30 seconds and try again, but yesterday
I had to actually get in on the passenger sided (couldn't open from
inside door handle), start car, lock using dash lock button, unlock.

It concerns me that the door can remain locked when it is supposed to
be unlocked - wouldn't want that failure mode in an accident
situation.
