In Feb. I got a citation for unlawful speed in the Boxster.
I went to court and fought the ticket.
Am pleased to report, you CAN beat radar tickets.

By 'beating' a ticket one may surmise I got caught speeding and then 'got
away' with the offense.  My beating it entailed going up against the
seemingly insurmountable evidence provided by the electronic device, and
proving it wrong.

Most interesting to note, and the real reason I'm posting it here, is that
the fact the Boxster has two speedometers helped the cause!  "What kind of
car has two speedometers?" the judge asked.

I toy with the idea of making a narrative of the matter, making it available
to other drivers.  
In my research I found some great scientific information regarding radar, and
most specifically hand held units.  I even went so far as to petition three
manufacturers to provide tech sheets and operation manuals on their devices.
 What the public believes is an infallible enforcement tool is actually one
small part of the formula.  Attacking it in court, efficiently (NOT
emotionally), cuts the states' case off at the knees.

At the same time I believe most drivers would kick the dirt, curse, pay the
fine and take the school instead of confronting the issue.
Enough to say I'm pleased.  It's nice to win one for a change!

Y'all keep the shiny side up.
