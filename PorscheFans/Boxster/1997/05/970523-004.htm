In reply to Mr. Felker's brilliant comments about the visor labels, I wish to
point out that if it wasn't for the "GD product liability lawyers", more
women would have been ripped up by dangerous and defective intrauterine
devices and cars wouldn't have headrests.  Of course, Felker probably thinks
that headrests are useless, ugly and stupid.  As far as the airbag warning
labels, I guess it would be better for more children to be severely and
permanently injured or killed rather than have that "stupid, useless and
ugly" label on the cheap plastic sun visor.  After all, that "stupid, useless
and ugly" label  may add a few tenths of a second to the Boxster's zero to 60
mph time or add a few tenths of a second to its slalom time or even to cause
it to come to a stop less quickly.  Not.
