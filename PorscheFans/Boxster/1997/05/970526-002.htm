For those of you with kids, the Boxster car seats will be out in two weeks.
 Although the dealers have not been notified as of yet, there will be three
seat sizes along with the adaptor for cutting off the airbag.

I have had numerous requests for the Boxster "boomerang" - the stainless
steel front protective bar for the front bumper.  For infomation and ordering
please call Ogner Porsche (818) 884-4411.  And yes, it is a simple 15 minute
install.  You can ask for Jeff Korda, the top Porsche mechanic in southern
california.  I consider this a must-have option.

TechArt is offerning a stereo upgrade the sounds interesting.  Has anyone
upgraded the upgraded system?  If so, I would appreciate the details.

Saw the Gemballa wheels - not great.  Also, saw the techArt body kit -
overdone for my taste.  The TechArt wheels (17x8.5 and 17x10) require spacers
as their offset is very aggressive.  I'll stick with my speedlines.
 
I''ll have pictures of many options in the next few weeks...
