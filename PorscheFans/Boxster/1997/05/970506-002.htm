I remember nearly buying a new Fiero 4 banger when all the
magazines raved about them when they came out... (Hi Pete  ;-)   )

I didn't test the Fiero when it came out. I only got in on the tail end, when
they finally made a car that was somewhat decent, with better styling and a
V6, just before they killed it (typical GM product cycle -- 1. bring out
mediocre product before it's ready. 2. let customers do your development for
you. 3. come out with a good product in its last model year). So don't lay
that one on me...<g>

I drove the Boxster too, and I can honestly say that the chassis struck me as
being one of the most rigid convertibles, if not the most rigid, I've ever
driven. I normally notice cowl shake right away. In the Boxster it was a
couple of hours of driving on the road before I even thought to look for it.
I don't know about the flex you mention, but in my testing, I didn't
experience any of it. Typically I'm pretty quick to beat up on cars for that
sort of thing. (Just had some sort of Japanese convertible, I think a Paseo,
one of the most flexible noodles of a chassis I've seen).
