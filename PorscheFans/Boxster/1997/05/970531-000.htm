Yesterday I was northbound on I-5, headed to Ft. Lewis, WA for a meeting. I
was enjoying the Boxster experience-top down, tunes on, spirits up- when I
felt a strange vibration, and the car gave a slight fishtail; No problem- off
throttle, in with clutch and slight brake.  At the roadside, I discovered the
left rear P-Zero was flat- no problem.  I called 1-800-PORSCHE, they gave me
the correct 800 number and a local truck was on the scene in about a
half-hour or so.  Good opportunity to evaluate Porsche's program.  I'm
pleased so far.  I limped home on the spare-nice little red alloy wheel-
after stowing the wheel and tire.  The tool kit contains a bag just large
enough for the 17 inch wheel and tire, and they fit-just barely- into the
front compartment.  We'll see what happens tomorrow about the replacement
tire.  Missed my meeting, I'll go up tomorrow and get up to speed, but I'm
happy to say that Porsche's emergency service looks good.  Anyone else have
any experiences good or bad?  Any other tire problems? Let us know!
                                                                That is all
for now,
