Well folks, I've had my Boxster for almost a week and during that time 
I've accumulated approximately 300 miles.  This past weekend my wife and 
I even took a few runs at the PCA Zone 7 Autocross school at Candlesti... 
 3Com Park.  What a blast.

First, let me describe my car.  Turquoise Blue with standard Gray 
interior, Tiptronic S, Sport Technic package (Springs, Shocks, Sway bars, 
17" wheels, Traction Control), Windstop, and CD 201 CD/Radio.  Purchased 
at MSRP from Carlsen Porsche in Palo Alto, CA.

The Boxster REALLY gets a lot of attention when driving around.  I've 
probably had a dozen people ask me at lights "What kind of car is that?" 
or "How do you like it?".  

At the autocross this weekend, I got a chance to check out the Sport 
Technic suspension.  It has increadible grip, and it's very controllable. 
 The steering is very light, but still provides feedback into what's 
happening at the front wheels.  The lot at Candlestick/3com is really 
bumpy, and it upset lots of the go-fast cars, but the Boxster just soaked 
up the bumps and kept asking for more.  It was really nimble, and I found 
it easy to toss in between tight pylon gates (in fact I don't think I hit 
more than one cone all weekend.  

I took all my runs with the traction control engaged, but one of the 
students had a 5-speed Boxster with TC and according to his instructor, 
with TC off he could slide the rear end using the throttle.  With 
traction control enabled, it was almost impossible to slide.  hmmm....

The Tiptronic makes autocross courses easy, just select manual mode, 
click down to first for the start and let the car shift to second when 
needed.  If you should need first gear for some reason (we didn't), it's 
easy to find since it's right on the steering wheel, and just a click 
away.

Our car came with Michelin Pilot tires, and I found them reasonably 
grippy, although they might have been a tad overinflated as delivered.  I 
lowered the right front from 48 psi down to 34 (the other tires ranged 
from 38-44 psi also!)

My wife, Ellen adapted to the car very quickly as well, besting my times 
on the first course we ran,  She was about 3 seconds back from the 
hot-shoe prepared 914-6's and 911s.  I guess a set of sticky tires, a 
little suspension alignment and some seat time would make a Boxster 
competitive at most autocrosses.

I also wanted to report on the (very small) problems I've had with my car 
so that others getting new cars would know what they might expect.  

Aware that several new owners has reported a coolant loss during the 
first few weeks, I've been keeping a close eye on the coolant level.  On 
third day, I noticed that the new car was already marking it's spot on 
the garage floor, with a few drips of coolant leaving a 4" puddle right 
in the center of the car under the engine area.  Since then it's done 
this twice more, both times I notice the puddle the next morning.  Even 
after bringing the car back hot from an hour-long drive, it didn't drip 
within the first two or three hours, but the next morning there was the 
puddle again.  There is no indication of leak while running, and the 
coolant level has not dropped.  

Top operation.  I also experienced the problem reported on this list 
where the edge of the top failed to slide into the "rain gutter" slot 
located just behind the window.  The next time I raised it I just stopped 
it half way up and made sure it engaged.  Everything seems fine, but it's 
something you need to look out for.

One of the instructions from the dealer was to make sure the top fully 
completes the cycle when opening or closing by continuing to press the 
button until the dash light goes out.  A couple of times it seemed that 
the light would never go out right away.  It turned out that I was 
latching the top (when raising it), then trying to push the button to 
wait for the light to go out.  When the latch is locked, the button is 
always non-operational, so you need to wait for the light to go out 
before locking the front latch.  Also, the dealer recommended closing the 
latch before it retracts fully.  So far, the only times I've raised the 
top has been to wash the car.

Looking forward to another fun week.
