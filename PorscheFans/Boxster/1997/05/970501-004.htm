If you have experience or knowledge about the Porsche Tiptronic transmission, 
then I would like to hear from you.  If you don't, but are interested, then 
watch this space!

I am putting together an article on fun use of the Tiptronic on the road and 
the track.  I have recently acquired a '96 911 Tiptronic, and have started to 
compete in Porsche Club of Victoria (Australia) events.  Very few of my fellow 
members compete with autos and they are different transmissions (eg 928), so I 
am somewhat on my own.  Published material tends to concentrate on basic 
operations, and not on how to get the most enjoyment or effectiveness.

It is a wonderful transmission and I have already learned some good tricks, 
but I need more guidance.  Please respond and make sure that you cc me at 
kitchen_john@emc.com 

I don't mind if your info is based on 911 or Boxster, but PLEASE, if you have 
particular information, identify the model and year of the car, since 
Tiptronic is an evolving implementation, and some things that work on one 
model don't on another.  For example the 911/964 (early 90s) is differrent to 
the 911/993 (mid 90s).

I look forward to your help, and even if you can't help, please drop me a line 
of encouragement if you are interested.

Finally, if you have technical German language translation skills, I have some 
Porsche diagrams I am trying to decode!

Regards, John '96 911 Coupe Tiptronic Speed Yellow
