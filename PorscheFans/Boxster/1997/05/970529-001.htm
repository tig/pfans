Hi-
  I just met my first fellow Boxster owner on the street.  He told me he has
had his car for three months, and that he bought it "off the rack" from a
dealer in California.  He paid straight Sticker and tax.  Says he sold a 993
and likes Der Boxster much better.  His only caution was that he thought it
felt "a little light" at  130MPH.  Didn't have time to quiz him about
options.  Perhaps there is a way to cut line if you call enough dealers...?  

My car came with the Aluminum colored dial faces.  I haven't quite got used
to them yet.  When driving at night they reflect stray light and make the
instruments difficult to read.  I think I would prefer basic black.  I can
only guess how grey or other colors might be, but I can't help thinking black
would be best from this standpoint.  German Tech Art has aluminum bezels for
the instruments, which I'd love to see.  I like the silver roll bars a lot,
more than I would have imagined.
