	You fun people who insist on sticking lawer labels on everything 
from cars to motorcycle gas tanks to bicycle(!) frames should realize 
one simple, simple thing.  If people are SO stupid as to remove 
themselves from the gene pool by various means they probably can't 
read either.  HOW in the bleeping expletive deleted did humans 
survive before the Feds and the lawyers were there to protect us?  
COMMON SENSE! God too!  Eyes open.

Subject: Re: Boxster Digest for 22 May 1997

In reply to Mr. Felker's brilliant comments about the visor labels, I
wish to point out that if it wasn't for the "GD product liability
lawyers", more women would have been ripped up by dangerous and
defective intrauterine devices and cars wouldn't have headrests.  Of
course, Felker probably thinks that headrests are useless, ugly and
stupid.  As far as the airbag warning labels, I guess it would be
better for more children to be severely and permanently injured or
killed rather than have that "stupid, useless and ugly" label on the
cheap plastic sun visor.  After all, that "stupid, useless and ugly"
label  may add a few tenths of a second to the Boxster's zero to 60
mph time or add a few tenths of a second to its slalom time or even to
cause it to come to a stop less quickly.  Not.
