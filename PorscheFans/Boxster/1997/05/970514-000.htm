Ever since day one (Jan. 27th to be specific) I've had a broken part on my
Boxster.

At every visit, at every repair, and in many telephone calls, I've asked for
that part to be replaced.
[It's the passenger side visor, the mirror door won't stay up.]

The folks at the dealership have it ordered, I'm assured.  It's just that it
has to come in from Germany...
[You see, it doesn't make any difference to me, but to the S.O. it's REAL
important.  Imagine having to hold the little door open while putting on
lipstick.  Imagine putting on lipstick while I push the car through imaginary
AutoX courses on the way to dinner...]

So I called PCNA to see if there is something they could do, being a higher
power and all.  
This call was to the Customer Assistance Center.
These are quotes from their representative, shared for the sheer amusement
value:

"You'll have to hurry up and wait when it comes to parts for the Boxster."
"Porsches' priority is building the Boxster to take care of the back log of
orders."
"Porsche is known for perfect performance automobiles.  Whether that's true
or not, you still come to expect everything to work on your new car." 
"If your problem does not directly affect the drive ability of the car,
Porsche won't put the repair on priority."
"I apologize for the problem you're having but we have many very satisfied
customers driving their Boxsters and 911's."
"For a part like that it may be six to eight months before sufficient supply
exists to replace your visor.  We have a nine month back order on whole
cars."
"You'll just have to endure the wait, there's nothing that can be done about
your car problem."

[I just wonder if anyone from PCNA is tapped into this PFans conduit, better
yet, anyone from PAG?  The Customer Assistance Center is located in Maryland,
not Reno.  Must comment, the person on the line was very polished, but also
very resolute in leaving my problem as mine alone.  Felt like apologizing for
calling.]

The real capper is the comment from the service advisor, "What do you want?
After all, it's only a forty thousand dollar car."
