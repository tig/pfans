One need never question the "whys and wherefores" of a "ripoff."


I wonder why a niche company like Automation chooses time and again to discredit themselves by offering freely available products at unreasonable or at least uncompetitive prices.  Automation does provide competent service and advice -- this can be the 'bread and butter' driver, but they seem to be missing some the game plan.


In my experience, a 'value add' company like Automation should be garnering respect and confidence in its market by offering these 'value add' products (like a nice book or something you see in their catalog that's not a part or a tool) at 'give away' prices.  The objective (a fundamental of niche marketing) is to win the trust of the market; to seed the thought in the customers mind "That's something I want and I trust <<company> to provide it at a competitive price."  This is the tenet of surviving as a niche vendor.  Automation is riding a buoyant market (in other words, people keep spending money on their Porsches) but they are failing to 'surf the wave.'  This is market-speak for a company that is adopting a self-limiting approach to the market -- they like to sell a small (relatively) volume to a niche market (Porsche enthusiasts) at a high margin instead of a higher volume to a wider niche (all Porsche owners) at a competitive margin.

Here endeth the sermon on nice marketing, but mark my words -- one day a new vendor (probably a large, named-brand reseller) will decide to compete in Automations' back yard.
