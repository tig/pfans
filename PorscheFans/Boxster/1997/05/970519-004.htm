There are two boxsters waiting around at Ooley-Blackburn in Carmel,
Indiana. Asking is $3,000 over sticker, out the door, no other taxes. Cars
have just delivery mileage.  One is black/black 5spd with sport package.
The other is a custom ordered speed yellow/black with technic sport package
(traction, ABD, springs, shocks, stabilizers) for $50k. There had been a
red one, but my partner and I flew down and bought it and drove it back to
Chicago on Saturday!

Steve is a regular guy, a self-described enthusiast, active in the local
PCA scene, and seemed to operate a straight-up operation from my short
interaction. I really have no other references so caveat emptor.

31 Third Street S.W, Carmel, IN 46032

PS - if you're targeting the yellow one make it contingent on Steve
swapping wheels with the black one which  has the Bridgestone S-02s that
really would have a better home on the yellow. I was sorely tempted, I'll
tell you ...
