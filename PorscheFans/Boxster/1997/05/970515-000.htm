Re PSchmier's posting of 14 May--
 This sounds shocking to me.  I can comprehend that there are unanticipated
demands for spare parts being generated by us, the user community. 
 If, like me, you are one of us who believed in Porsche in 1993 when we
placed our orders for an auto whose final form could only be guessed at, this
sort of treatment seems not only amazing but almost incredible.  I can only
imagine that it is the result of inadequate oversight on the part of PCNA and
PAG that would allow such rude and short-sighted conduct to be tolerated.   I
would also bet this failure gets promptly resolved. 
 Porsche is ascendant-- They don't need our sympathy, but they certainly want
the good will of all of us for whom this is the first purchase of a new
Porsche.  It's irrelevant what the car costs, many of us want it in
preferance to various other models,  and  such customer service is
antithetical to the Kaizen-Demming "do it right the first time" quality
culture that the company is touting with respect to their dramatic
turnaround. 
 I pray I don't suffer your fate- this decision to purchase a Boxster was
made in conjunction with my wife, and I can't imagine having to endure a
poisioning crisis of confidence with her over a manufacturer's
inability/unwillingness to make such satisfaction a high priority.
Good luck, I bet your trials are soon resolved- and keep us posted on your
progress!
