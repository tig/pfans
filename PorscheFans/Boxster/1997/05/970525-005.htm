Serge,

If true, why such a difference between the label on the early boxster's
(mine delivered mid-February) and the one's delivered now?  I can't find
any indication that new rules took effect during this time period.

Hello, RC!
I can't answer your question at the moment, I'll have to ask around a bit but I 
think that the rule came recently into effect. I saw them on a Boxster recently 
and they were a bit over the top. As I said in my original mailing, the idea is 
to get manufacturers to develop "smart" airbags. Heaven knows how any system 
will recognize "out of position" passengers, differentiate between children on a 
seat and a small grandmother sitting up against the windshield on the passenger 
seat, etc., etc.
Just imagine: if North Americans wore seat belts like most Europeans, there 
would not be these problems. But, there you go....
Tschüß!
Serge
