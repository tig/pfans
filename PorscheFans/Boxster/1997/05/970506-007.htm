Being a very cautious fellow,  I decided to call Porsche in Germany to get
their input before odering the 17" Speedline Wheels and Modified Exhaust for
my car.  Here's what I learned from the company's worldwide tech engineer...

Three piece 17" wheels are fine as long as they will accept Porsche's
sphercial bolts.  This means the cones of the wheels holes must match (as do
Speedline, TechArt, and Gemballa).  In fact, the engineer I spoke with likes
the look of the three-piece wheels very much on the Boxster (for a German
"likes very much" is really saying something!)   By the way, 18" Speedlines
were used to dress the Boxster prototype.

Modifying the Boxster muffler only effects noise levels, not backpressure.
  Prosche has done extensive testing over the last several months with
various exhaust systems and has concluded that as long as all work is done
behind the CAT there is no issue.  It will not harm the engine but will also
not enhance performance.  If you want a bit more roar, go for it.

Yes, as we all know, there will be more powerful engines coming... within the
next two years.  That's right - two years!  At present Porsche is eight
months behind in production.  Don't expect to see the next generation Boxster
anytime soon.

For future reference Porsche's number is 011 49  711 8270.  Oh, and have
plenty of quaters on hand.  The call cost me $37.65.
