Gentlemen and Ladies:
Would I be out of line to suggest the warring comments be isolated to
the Flamers list. I think we all want to exchange info here. I have
found all your comments very helpful. Editorially, product liability has
saved lives but also tends to tread on individual rights in the name of
the masses. Nuther words,"Don't tread on me: I'll accept my fate."

Warrnty wise: thank you for response. GECAP does seem to be the most
appealing but form what I have been quoted, the most expensive.  Do you
all agree an extended warranty is is good thing on a new first model
year car? I have never purchased one and have been very lucky with my
foreign and domestic purchases.  This list has pointed out unpleasant
nusances with the new car but by and large tolerable if they do not
persist. I look forward to the arrival of my new car next week
(hopefully) in trouble-free bliss ( I like to live in a dream world).
