what happened.)<<

It appears names are being automatically deleted (both here and on the 911,
but not on the 356).
I hope the reason it has yet to be attended to is because the person
responsible got a job with the Internal Revenue Service, maintaining their
lists.
What a concept!

Joke aside;  someone not connected to the operation of PFans took it upon
himself to send messages to individual members of the lists and told them to
re subscribe.  I've not heard from anyone officially but I do know I'm now
back 'on line' receiving my messages, after re subscribing.

Boxster content;  It finally happened.  
The other day I saw another Boxster driving along the street I was on.
Up until that moment I had that 'solitary' feeling whenever I was out.
The bubble has bursted.

Y'all have a great weekend.
