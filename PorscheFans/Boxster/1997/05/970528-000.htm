I am happy to report that after placing an order last week for a
November Boxster, I received a call yesterday about a cancellation at a
nearby dealership in the color I was looking for.  Granted, I'll have to
do without the heated seats and T/C, but it's here in time for the
summer!  Bought the car on the wire.  Picking it up later today!  Just
goes to show, spray your name across as many dealers as possible, you
may get a car sooner than expected.

As with all things in life, we want the ones that we can't have.  Now
that I am stuck without T/C, I was wondering what people think of it.
In particular, since I live in NYC and we do get snow now and again, I
am a bit worried that the car will not do well w/o T/C in wet or frosty
conditions due to the very wide tires it has.  Also, can you put snow
tires on the Boxster?  Sorry for what I fear is a stupid question.
