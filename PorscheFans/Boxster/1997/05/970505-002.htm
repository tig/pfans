Yep, after waiting three years, I finally get my Boxster.  Overall, I'm
pleased with it (look, feel, performance).

Yesterday I hit 149 m.p.h. on my routine trip to the local food hall,
Porsches' advertised top end for the car.
I, of course, zipped through the five speed manual transmission with my
throttle foot flat to the floor in each gear.  Zero to sixty m.p.h. was
within the specification for the car (I forget right now.)
I drive the car at the very edge at ALL times (doesn't everyone??)

As for the debate on the 'extra 50 h.p.' rumored to be forthcoming in a
future derivation of the Boxster.... what was it, 1998 sometime??
Uh huh, sure, why not procrastinate another twelve to sixteen months before
placing an order?  
Like that 50 h.p. is gonna make a whole hell of a lot of difference.

I've driven both the four cylinder and six cylinder Z3's.  They still suck,
more power or not.

Oh yeah, I'd like the extra 50 horses in my Boxster, who wouldn't?  
But, does it make or break the car?  NO.
A well qualified and resolute _NO_.

Dive right on it folks, the water is fine.  REAL fine!  [even at a wimpy 210
h.p.!]
