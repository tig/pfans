Has anyone noticed the clear center windstop chirping as if flexes at high
speed?

The noise reminds me of an unoiled hamster's exercise wheel. It's pretty
much continuous. I can't tell for sure where it comes from. I'm pretty sure
it isn't the two locking pins. I think the noise comes from either the
center foot area or from the junction between the clear glass and its frame.

I'll be asking the dealer tomorrow. Anyone else?
