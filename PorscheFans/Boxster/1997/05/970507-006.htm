Gook luck Mike. You'll need it...;-)

We had a guy bring out one of the original dealer Guards models with no
bells/whistles to last weekends regional autox and I had to work 
like hell to beat the guy for FTD in my stock RS America.  The fastest of
the 993's was .5 seconds back on R1's while the Boxter and I were
on street tires.  
  
Course wise, it was one of those one-line type layouts with tight 
sweepers, two 5-cone 20' slaloms, and a few offsets.  All I can say is the 
Boxter turns in like no stock car I've ever seen and did so with little 
drama.  As impressive as the transient handling was concerned, I was also
amazed at how well it pulled off the corners as well.  A Boxter with 3.0L?
My poor RS America's starting to look like trade bait...
