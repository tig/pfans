Thanks to a tip from Steve Marcus I called his dealer (Paul) at Champion
Motors in Florida and got a lead on a used Boxster for delivery in ... one
week. It's a used car, taken as a trade-in, and will have 1500 miles.The
sticker options are ocean blue metalic, graphite grey partial lthr, sport
package, Tip, door sills, CD shelf console, wheel caps w/ colored crest.

Sticker was $48.6k and it's being offered for $52k firm. Dealer says they
gave the PO close to sticker on his trade-in. It sounds reasonable. I know
my local dealer had a 150mile black used Boxster that they had picked up
for *over* sticker themselves, just to have the merchandise. Anyway I'm
reconciled to paying the premium to play rather than wait for my order slot.

Still, the question lurks: why would someone trade in a brand new boxster!
My worst fear would be that the car got hit and was patched up. Since this
will be a used car purchase I'll be going to check out the car. Can anyone
suggest a shop to take the car to for a 2nd opinion or quick once over in
the Pompano Beach (Boca-Ft. Lauderdale) area? Maybe a body shop would be
more to the point than a wrench shop. Should I require a written
assurance/warranty that the car is in like-new condition?

All other comments, advice or suggestions are welcomed.
