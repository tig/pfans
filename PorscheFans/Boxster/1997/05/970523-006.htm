My car apparently just left Charleston today. I'm told it will most 
likely arrive in northern California next Friday the 30th. Apparently the 
truck doesn't take a direct route but rather will make multiple stops at 
various other dealers around the country. Seems to me that there are 
enough dealers in NoCal to justify one truck direct to the Bay Area. Oh 
well, what's another week? I've already waited 5 months and from what I 
can tell that's on the short side. As soon as I get it and have had a 
chance to drive it around a bit I'll follow up with a report.

As for the visors I don't mind being warned about airbags but I do mind 
when it really interferes with the look of the car. The visors on the 
newer Boxsters are incredibly ugly, to the point of being distracting. My 
current car (an Acura Integra) also has a warning printed on the visors 
but it is B&W and subtle enough that it doesn't drive me nuts. I know 
it's there but its not distracting. It's OK for the government to enforce 
safety regulations but it's also OK to point out to them when they go too 
far. I think this goes too far and that the warnings should be less 
obnoxious.  I'll probably try to take the ugly ones on my Boxster off, or 
perhaps get some aftermarket place to cover them in something that looks 
nicer than the plastic.
