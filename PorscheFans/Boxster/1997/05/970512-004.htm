Boxster team:

As I posted, I'm in love with my 3-piece Speedline Wheels.  However, the
front tires (17X8) slightly rub the plastic shield within the wheel wells
when turned all the way to the left or all the way to the right.

The dealer said not to be concered... even the Boxster 17X7 rub when
cornering very hard.

What's interesting is that TechARt is offering even wider front wheels for
the Boxster (17x8.5). 

Would you be concened?  What do you think? 

One other thing -  I had a front protective "boomerang" (made of  polished
steel) installed under the front bumper.  I've seen two Boxsters  with their
bumpers scratched up from driveways and dips.  The beauty part is you can't
even see it unless you look under the car.  Orgner Porsche in Woodland Hills,
CA has them custom made.
