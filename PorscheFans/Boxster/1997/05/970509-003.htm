No it wasn't Greg Fordahl Mike, he was driving a silver car that had the
sport package but not the sport suspension, for fun runs. I wasn't there
but it looked like he was having fun. I'm taking my new car with the
Technique package down for our PCA Event on the 24th and I'll bet Greg
will take some time in it if he gets a chance, and we'll see what he can
do then.


With regards to the package questions, I'm waiting to see what the bike
carrier is like, as far as I know it's unavailable at the moment.  The
suspension package I have (not the sport package which is just the
wheels and tyres, but the full suspension package) is nice, but it might
be harsh if your streets are worse than ours up here in the pacific
northwest, next to my 911 I wouldn't say it's cushy but it's really
firm, and flat int he corners..
