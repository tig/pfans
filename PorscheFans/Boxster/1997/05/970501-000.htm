Hey dudes,

For those of you in Canada, watch Motoring 97 this week.  They feature a red
Boxster with sport suspension.  They run the car in an autocross course and while
my eyes are no timing device, I can see this car dominating AS in SCCA.  The car
was quite amazing.  I could never see my 951 handling like that and my car
is supposed to be one of the best handling cars in the world.

All of you should sign up for SCCA.  With a car like that, how can you not?

Rumour has it that one of the Fordahls drove a Boxster on street tires recently
and was only 2 seconds behind Bill "bigtoe" Buetow on race rubber.  Sounds like
AS domination is on it's way.

Farzaan.
89 951 - boost cranked!
