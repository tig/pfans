Bernadine Benavidez <bjb19@columbia.edu> asked :

<< Has anyone out there ordered or taken delivery of a Boxster with the
 Technic Sport option?  Sounds like a great deal but a salesman told me
 that it makes the car VERY stiff and given the stiffness of the base car
 - not necessary.  I live in NYC (lots of potholes and such) so I am
 concerned that the car will rattle to pieces over time.  Any comments
 wellcome.  Thanks.

I would be VERYconcerned with any suspension in NYC.
Here is a post I made when the lists were down :

I heard from a few people who saw a boxster at an autocross
that it exhibited some weird behavior. They said that
coming off the start line from stopped with full throttle on
soft compound tires, the car shuddered and the
windshield and doors could be seen to flex a LOT -
even from far away you could see the flexing.
 I thought that the boxster platform was
supposed to be very stiff. Even my ancient flexi 911S
targa does not cause the doors to flex like that.

Anyone else notice this sort of behavior?

I know the car magazines tested these at the drag strips,
but it seems they don't release bad points about new cars.
I remember nearly buying a new Fiero 4 banger when all the
magazines raved about them when they came out... (Hi Pete  ;-)   )
