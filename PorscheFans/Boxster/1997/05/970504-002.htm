     I suppose it's only natural to mull the prospect of subsequent changes
to the Boxster.  So far, the only scrap of info I've seen regarding follow-on
models that seemed to have an authoritive air to it was the "spy photo" and
text in the May '97 Road & Track.  FWIW, I prefer the appearance of the
current Boxster.
     Certainly 20-25% more horsepower would be wonderful ("you can never be
too thin, too rich, or have too much horsepower"?),  but for me, the thought
of waiting for some automotive change on the horizon is like waiting for
computer technology.      
     The engine case  castings are "996"series part numbers.  Naturally,
large performance increases in areas such as torque and horsepower would
suggest a need for upgrades in other areas like braking and power delivery,
but I expect these parts have been designed with an eye to future  needs in
this regard.  Just look at the distinguished history of other Porsche
products.  I expect many of us will still be committed Boxsterphiles in
another five and ten years, discussing the merits of various thechnical
avenues and the advisability of keeping our cars "pure", just as the larger
Porsche community has been doing for years.  Feels to me like we're on the
ground floor of something that's going to be big!
