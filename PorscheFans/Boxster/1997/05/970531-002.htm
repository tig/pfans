Stan,

I'm 6'4", with a 32" inseam.  If I was any taller it would be a tight
fit.  With the top up, lots of head room, as long as I have the seat
pushed all the way down first, then push it back as far as it will go.
Messing around with the electric recliner on the drivers seat bought me
a little more space as well.  With the top down, I find the wind
deflector between the seats does little since the top of my head sits in
the slipstream above the windshield.   As I've mentioned before, the
biggest complaint from a space perspective is that the console between
the floor and the dashboard rubs my knee -  without it I'd have no
complaints.  However, unlike the european version, the US version is not
a simple takeout, it has the electronics for the airbag, and a ton of
wires under it.  I've decided not to screw around with it now, but when
(when?) my "s" shows up I may have some fabrication work done.
