'fans,

Allow to respond to "RAK19102@aol.com" note. 

Paternalism is fine to a point. Simple and removable stickers, albiet as
obnoxious, would have sufficed! The car is MINE!! I can do what I want
with it, as long as I DO NOT infringe on another right! 

This air bag thing is out of control. Thanks to the press and people who
are/were looking for a sensational story, we now have people "scared to
death" of thier airbag, and having them dissconnected. It is the
reponsibility of a product owner to learn how to correctly operate any
product including a car. It states in the owners manual how to properly
sit in a car with an airbag. There are easily removable sticker on the
dash about the things anyway.

Turning to the attack on my comments about layers, let me ask you a few
questions. 

Why do you think your car insurance is So high? Liability insurance!
Why do drugs and medical devices cost so much?  Liability insurance!
Why do ALL items cost more than they should! Liability insurance!

Your comments are improper for the P-fans board! This SHOULD end any
further discussion on MY comments. I welcome any and all comments
regarding the removal of the labels or replacement of the visors!

John Felker
