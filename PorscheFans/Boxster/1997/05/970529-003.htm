Hello all,

I went and sat in my boxster last night. It's silver and black with
alumunum guages, shifter, and hand brake. I had ordered
the body colour roll bar but the car was shipped with a black roll bar.
Oh well, I might have it painted locally. I also ordered
the leather upgrade. I think that it really is an improvement
over the stock black interior. The stock interior is just
that much too shiny in my opinion. I am having my dealer
replace the sunvisors with a car they have in stock. I cannot
believe how bad the new visors look. All around I am pleased
with the look of the car.

I will report again when I actually take delivery and drive home..

Time needs to go faster!!!!

PS. My car was a March build and will be delivered tommorow.
The car was completed on April 7th. So that makes approx. 8
weeks from the end of the assembly line to my hands.

Scott.
