Stan, I have driven a couple of Boxsters with the top up and down. I am 6' and 
180 pounds. I am sure your will not have any problem. The drivers seat adjusts 
for height. I am pretty sure there was more headroom with the soft top up on 
the Boxster that the headroom on my 944. The optional hard top has less 
headroom though.

If you fit in the Miata, you will have plenty of room in the Boxster.

<<I just ordered a Boxster, but have still not been able to sit in or drive
one.  I realize this is risky, but I will test drive one before I take
delivery in 1998.  I am 6'3" and 220 pounds.  My current Miata is a tight
but workable fit.  Does anyone have any experience with tall drivers and
the interior fit of the Boxster?  I have been unable to find any
specifications for legroom, headroom (yes...top up!), or shoulder room for
the car.  Thanks for any help.
