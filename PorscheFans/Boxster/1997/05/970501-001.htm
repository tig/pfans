Andrew Chan asked about the costs for maintenance of the Boxster.

I had my oil and filter changed yesterday at Mattie Imports in Fall
River, MA.  The cost was about $82 which included approximately $24
for the filter and $40 for 8 quarts of Mobil 1.  I don't have the
invoice in front of me so I may be off by a few dollars.  Doesn't seem
too bad to me.

On another front, my ABS warning light keeps coming on after 20 miles
of driving and going off when I stop the car for a while.  They
plugged in the computer and said that there were two wheel speed
sensor faults (#4215 and #4216, anyone know the difference?) and a
DME control momdule fault (#104).  They reset the faults, but it
continues to happen.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?

(Last time I sent a message to the list, there were only about 80
people on the list instead of something like 800 before.  I wonder
what happened.)
