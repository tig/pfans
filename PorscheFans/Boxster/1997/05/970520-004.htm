I have 1500 miles on my Silver/Red Tiptronic beauty.  It is truly a great
car (previous Porsches have been '62 Roadster, '69 911E, 84 944).  

A few comments:

* The aft trunk gets quite hot.  Not a place for ice cream from the grocery.

* With the top down, the rear plastic window picks up a lot of dust,
especially two rings from the two adjacent turn-locks of the engine lid.  

* I too have noticed 'water' under the car after driving, and have thot it
was from the air conditioner, but perhaps I should check into it.

* The wheels (Boxster special) build up black soot very quickly.

Does anyone know a safe way of removing those ugly "Airbag Warning"
stickers off the sun visors?
