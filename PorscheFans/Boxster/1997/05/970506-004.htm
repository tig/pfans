Pete,

Thank you for the note (haven't heard from you for a while so
I thought I'd stir you up).

OK but too bad they couldn't build them again with some
of the powerful V6s they now have...

OK thanks. I thought you might have felt something in your
instrumented 0 - 60 tests. My Senta SE-R is a nice car
but darn that thing flexes ten times as much as my
ancient open topped 911!

We will see how the Boxster does in future solo events as
more show up... wish me luck against them!
