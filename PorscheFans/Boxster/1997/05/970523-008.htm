I was set to receive my auto today, 'till I called my dealer for an update
and was told the truck was running late.  Apparently some of the deliveries
aren't Porsche exclusive loads- I was told that a Ferrari delivery was being
made prior to mine in another part of the state first, perhaps with a delay
until Tuesday.  I don't know, so I can't say for sure, but I wonder whether
with Porsche's success they have underestimated the need for delivery
vehicles?  Arranging for scarce resources must take time, and so it goes
'till it all shakes out.
   In this month's Panorama there was a review of PCA Zone 1's technical
conference.  Lots of good stuff  about the Boxster.  John Paterek, PCA tech
expert on exteriors/interiors suggested the Boxster could do with stone
guards around the wheel wells.  I called him, and he was great- very
 helpful.  He's sending me some information by mail.  I'll try to study this
material and summarize it.  He uses and recommends P21s cleaning and wax.
That's all for now...
