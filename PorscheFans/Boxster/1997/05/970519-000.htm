P-FANS,

IT'HERE!!

My car has arrived at the dealer.  It arrived just two hours ago, will
be "cleaned up" tomorrow and I will FINALLY get to drive it home on
Wednesday. 


I need to know what items to which I should pay SPECIAL attention when I
personally inspect it prior to the actual purchase. What are the
items/problems that some of you have noted once you got your Boxster
home? I know some had problems with the coollant levels, fit of the top,
and others.  

Please let me know any and ALL! No matter how small or insignificant it
was! I have to drive 80 miles to the dealer and I hope to avoid mutliple
trips!  I do not want to get home a then notice a problem simply because
I was "blinded" by my emotions at the time of delivery! I will take
delivery in the morning and would rather spend the rest of the day being
sure the car is as perfect as possible!!!


THANKS,

JOHN FELKER
