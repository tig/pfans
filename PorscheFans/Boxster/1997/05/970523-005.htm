I hate to sound like an adolescent but my car was shipped end of April
and arrived in the port of Charleston two weeks ago and there it sits.
Does anybody have any idea why the cars are being shipped so slowly once
they get on this side of the Atlantic? It was expected to arrive
yesterday which would have been nice for the holdiday weekend. I was
told they "couldn't fit it on the truck." Valid or bs?
I have inquired several times regarding the extended warranty and not
really received much response. I am told I can get a CIGNA policy 7/70
for $1965; a GE Capital (no deductible) 6/70 for $2200 (this policy is
suppossed to be readily transferrable- comes with its own credit type
card) and one from "warrantygold" 6/70 approx for $1465.  There is a big
difference. One problem is I am buying the car from another dealership
than the one to which I will be receiving service. The local dealer
claims it will only accept its own policy (ge-cap...the most expensive)
and that any other extended warranty policy is between me and the
company... they are telling me I will have to pay them(local dealer) in
cash and get my own reimbursement.  Also GeCap covers electronics with
no deductible while the CIGNA policy has a sliding scale. Warrantygold
is an internet supplier and I am not to serious about it.  What does
anybody advise including whether a newly produced vehicle warrants it at
all? Jim from Boston already shared some of his thoughts. Any body else?
Suppossedly the car will be in NEXT week... we'll see. I keep you
posted.

All thoughts and advice welcome.
