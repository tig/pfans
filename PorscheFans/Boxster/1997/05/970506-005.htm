BOXSTER GROUP!


I just got off the phone with the Porsche Dealer. My Boxster has been 
manufactured and has left PAG on 4/22. I got the VIN and now am waiting!

I will let you all know when the car is actually delivered!

I have had a lot of problems with the dealer, about when the car would
be made and delivered and other misinformation. I ordered in Novemeber,
and each month I got the story that it should be here in "60-90 days". 
I finally called PCNA a month and a half ago, and told them, "I
understand the Boxster supply situation, but would like to some straight
answers. Has the Dealer submitted my order?  What is the estimated date
of manufacute?  When can I ecpect deleiver?".  The lady at PCNA, (Kelly)
was VERY helpful, and got me the answers I wanted!!  She had to call the
dealer and speak to them directly, and I am not sure if that sped the
process.
