I have had the technic sport package for 5000 miles,  3 track days, and one
autocross.  I would not have the car any other way.  I am a track junkie and
have always driven Porsches with stiff suspensions.  I have also driven the
regular car and it indeed was a softer ride.  It is not an option I would get
if I only planned to take the interstate ramps.  It will do very nicely.  On
the other hand, the $1911 option is a bargain. The  T C that comes with that
option is a pain.  If you decide to pull out fast from a side street onto the
main road at a brisk pace, it can bite you.  The back end will start to come
around and TC will not let it do so.  It will retard the ignition  and take
  1-4 cylinders out of the combustion cycle and you sit there with no RPM to
get going.   Not a pleasant feeling.  Of course you can always think ahead
and turn off the TC before pulling out of the street. Ha,Ha
good luck with your decision.
