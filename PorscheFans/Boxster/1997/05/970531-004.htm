stan,

i haven't driven one yet either, but i have spent a fair amount of time
sitting in the showroom model at our dealer.  i was concerned, and i'm only
6'1".  also, i'm pretty slender.  from a height perspective (or, more
importantly from a leg perspective, since i'm sure we'll never use the top
in san diego :-) if i push the seat all the way back it's a tad too much
for me.  if your extra two inches are all in your legs it might be rough.
if they're distributed a little more evenly (which they probably are) i'd
guess you'll do all right.  with the top up i actually had decent room.
again, assuming an even distribution of the two inches i'd say you're ok.
the seats, however, proved to be a pretty snug fit on me.  i like them a
lot actually, but i weigh about 170.  hope they work for you . . .

I just ordered a Boxster, but have still not been able to sit in or drive
one.  I realize this is risky, but I will test drive one before I take
delivery in 1998.  I am 6'3" and 220 pounds.  My current Miata is a tight
but workable fit.  Does anyone have any experience with tall drivers and
the interior fit of the Boxster?  I have been unable to find any
specifications for legroom, headroom (yes...top up!), or shoulder room for
the car.  Thanks for any help.
	Stan
