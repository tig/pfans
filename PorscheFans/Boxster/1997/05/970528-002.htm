In reality, it probably makes no difference (to your case) that there
are two speedometers since they are both being fed by the same
electronic sensors, and thus, they will read the same information
(albeit in different ways).  However, if one is inaccurate, they both
will be and having two doesn't improve your accuracy.

Unfortunately, I can prove that they are both being fed from the same
sensors.  I belive my Boxster is  having problems with the wheels
speed sensor(s).  The first symptom was that the ABS light would come
on after driving for a while.  The dealer checked the diagnostic
computer and it reported several "wheel speed sensor faults".  They
cleared the faults and sent me on my way.  Of course, it continues to
happen and it has been getting worse.  Lately, after the ABS light
comes on, both speedometers periodically (and simultaneously) drop to
zero for a while.  If this happens after high speed driving and
doesn't recover before stopping, then the rear spoiler remains
extended after I stop.

More interestingly:  I mistakenly thought that the volume on the radio
changed with the ambient noise.  It seems that instead, it changes
depending on the speed.  When the speedometers drop to zero, the radio
gets very soft.  I can hear when they come back because the radio gets
louder.

If any of you are speedometer impaired, it is useful to note that 3000
rpm in 5th is exactly 75mph and each tick on the tachometer is 5 mph.
At least with 16" tires.
