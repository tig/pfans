I would suggest a Macintosh running webstar. Macs are fast, not too
expensive and easy to administer.  A recent contest in Europe offered
$13,000 if anyone could break into their Mac-based web site, and no
one could.  Of course, this discussion would best be held off line.

The Boxster comes with cupholders!  They really made me laugh.  They
are these little folding contraptions that clip into the airvents near
the windows.  They are the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen, but I
suppose they made them for people like your girlfriend who won't buy a
car without cupholders.  I wonder if they come with the car in Europe?
