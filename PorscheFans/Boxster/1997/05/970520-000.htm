     -Subject: windstop chirping
     
     -Has anyone noticed the clear center windstop chirping as if flexes at 
     -high speed?
     
     -The noise reminds me of an unoiled hamster's exercise wheel. It's 
     -pretty much continuous. I can't tell for sure where it comes from. 
     -I'm pretty sure it isn't the two locking pins. I think the noise 
     -comes from either the center foot area or from the junction between 
     -the clear glass and its frame.
     
     -I'll be asking the dealer tomorrow. Anyone else?

     he had some problems with his windstop . I believe he fixed it with 
     some vaseline? or somthing Check out his website and email him to find 
     out exactly what the cause was .
     
     My Boxster is running great . I am a little worried because I have not 
     found anything wrong Yet ? Touch wood ...
