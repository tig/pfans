What I like:
Great fun car.  At virtually any dynamic, the thing is lots of FUN.
It's a piece of art, nicely sculptured
That evasive feeling of having the only one like it in town is still strong.
Instant response from the wheel, surgical precision shifting, solid braking.
Chameleon like, the car has different -top up/top down- personalities.
Seeing it from a distance, it's quite a package, going or sitting still.
Overall; a nice little bundle of sporting auto.
*****
What I don't like:
Having a hanger queen.  It's been to the shop more than I would like (see
list).
Paw prints on the windows from parking lot gawkers.
Occupants of passing cars staring at me like I've got a booger hanging out.
The zoom swerves getting lookie loo in traffic (scary).
CD changer situation.
Being Porsches' emissary.
*****
List:
Problem / remedy
Coolant leak. / Replaced hose.
Interior vents nonfunctional.  / Replaced vents.
Intermittent top.  / Replaced relay.
Whistle or howl at 50 mph.  / Adjusted hood.

Passenger visor mirror door broken.  / Pending repair.

*****
Keeper?  I dunno.
Want more H.P.?  Not that it would make that much difference, no, don't need
it.
Lower it?  That's an idea, but it rides so nice.  Will I loose that with
different springs? Likely.
Different wheels?  Maybe, but these stock 17" look good enough.
Need anything to make it better?  No, it's just fine.
*****
Don't have one?  Get one.  It's a blast.
