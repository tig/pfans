Pfans:

After pricing the 6 disc changer @ the dealer, I went shopping on the
internet.  Becker's site (can't remember address) had a dealer named
Frank's Auto Electronics in Savannah, GA.  (phone 912-355-8780).  I
ordered the 6 disc changer for my Boxster from him.  Came with the data
cable and cost $529.00 delivered to my door.  Took about 10 days as he
does not stock it.

Then bought mounting kit parts from the dealer.  Cost about $40.00. 
Makes a real nice install/upgrade since I only got the in-dash unit with
the car.  

Don't know if Frank's price is the best around, but I am happy and he
delivered as promised.  

A note - he does not like taking credit card orders over the phone, says
he wants a signature.  I faxed him a request for the unit with my credit
card number and a signature.  That worked for him.

Dave
