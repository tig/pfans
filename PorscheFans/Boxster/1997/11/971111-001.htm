I disagree with the following statement: =20

"Porsches' customer is NOT you the car owner, but the dealership.
Porsche AG (Stuttgart) sells cars to the company that sells you your
car.
Porsche AG uses a distributor called Porsche Cars North America (PCNA)
to
manage the process of distribution, marketing, service, and leasing."

When PAG sells a car, it contains a warranty to the ultimate buyer,
i.e. the end user.  When the car does not perform as warranted, PAG is
contractually liable to the car owner, not the dealer that sold the
car. =20

If, as or when any dealer performs work that is covered under the PAG
two year warranty, the repair work is not paid for by the end user
because of PAG's contractual commitment made to the consumer at the
time of sale.

PAG has strong economic motivation to market a product that will
perform as warranted.=20
