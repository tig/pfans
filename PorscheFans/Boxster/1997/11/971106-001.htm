Gee, I agree that this is a real bummer and even though Porsche will
not defer their lease payments or the bank the car payments, the owner
gets nothing for the money except to watch the car depreciate.  Too
bad that a "loaner" is not part of the Porsche warranty in this
situation.  After all, the used car salesmen drive cars home
everynight.  Why not give a paying customer a used Porsche?  I suppose
the answer lies in the law of the market place.  If Porsche has a line
of potential customers standing at their door, each with a wad of cash
in hand to plunk down on a Boxster, they do not have to do a whole lot
to ensure customer satisfaction.

Does anyone else recall the stuff that Western Auto used to sell for
auto engine - radiator - transmission cracks?  It was thicker than
honey and had little black liquid balls that settled in the bottom.
All the buyer had to do was pour two or three bottles of this goo in
the appropriate filler pipe and Voila! No Leaks.  It worked great on
my first car, a 1936 Ford and probably cost less than a buck a bottle.

Strange that modern science and technology has not come up with some
such to work on today's machines, at least as a temporary patch to
stop an oil drip until a part can come in from overseas.
