TO:  Karel Juhl

You asked if anyone is glad the bought a Boxster..  We have one of the first
Boxsters in the United States, (picked it up in NC on Jan 21).  The car is
wonderful and each time I drive it, I fall more in love with the way it looks
and handles.

To date, with the exception of replacing the wind screen, we have not had one
moments problem with the car.  No rattles, oil use (do have the smoke on
start up) or any of the other problems that seem to be bothering other
Boxster owners.  This is our 5th Porsche and perhaps we are more in tune with
what to expect and what not to expect in a Porsche.  

Did you make a mistake in ordering one...In my humble opinion NO....but then
I am very biased.  Hope you enjoy your Boxster as much as we do ours.
