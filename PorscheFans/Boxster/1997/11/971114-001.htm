Well I must say I am a little disappointed.  I just found out my
Boxster is on its way from Europe and will be at my doorstep in 2-5
weeks.  This is the good news.

However, after assuring me from the beginning that I would have a
German built Boxster, my sales rep told me that the car was built in
Valmet as opposed to Stuttgart.

I can't help but feel a little less enthused about the car.  After
all, when I open the door every day I will see "Made in Finland" on my
Porsche door sill.

I have been told that the parts ALL come from the same place, and that
build quality may even be better because of the scrutiny of this new
endeavour.  However, the rich history of Porsches being built at
Stuttgart and tested at Weissach has an intangible value that is lost.

Either way, I am going to receive the car and am sure will love
everything about it. I just can't help but feel a little "left out". 

Has anyone received a Valmet built Boxster?  What, if any, will this
do to resale value?  I would be very interested to see what other
people think about this topic.
