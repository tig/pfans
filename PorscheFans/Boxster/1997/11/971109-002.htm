The Boxster that I will be picking up in a few weeks is supposed to be a
'98, but the dealer said it would not have side-impact airbags, as that is
an option. I'm concerned that the car will be a '97, as I understand that
the airbags are supposed to be standard equipment on '98's. Since I'm not
fluent in Japanese and the dealer speaks only fair English, it's difficult
to get very far with this subject, but he plainly said that my car would
not have the airbags. I'm hoping he just doesn't know, but I'm wondering if
this could be an option for Boxsters intended for Japan. Could you help me
out on this one?
Thanks,
