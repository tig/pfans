I have had an entirely different experience with Barrier. I put down my
deposit in August of 96. At that point, they told me I was 56th in line and
that I could expect delivery in August of 97. During that year, my
salesperson, Steven, called several times telling me that a Boxster had
become available for whatever reason, and asking if I was interested.
Porsche forces dealers to take cars with certain option packages at various
points. For example, the first Boxster every dealer had to take was Guards
Red with absolutely no options. At another point they had to take an Arctic
Silver car with the Sport Touring Package and the Tiptronic. I wasn't
interested because I wanted my options. I checked in at various points and
was given updates about where my car was each time. I took delivery exactly
when they predicted, two days short of one year from when I put down the
deposit.

I've had a couple of minor glitches with the car. The passenger seat lever
to get behind the seat didn't work. I scheduled an appointment a few days
later. They drove me home and picked me up that afternoon when the seat was
fixed. A month later the airbag warning light came on. I left the car with
them when I went on a business trip. When I got back, it was after closing.
I had called them earlier in the day, and they offered to leave my car out
and lock my key in the trunk so I could pick it up. I also got a new set of
cup holders when the first set fell apart. No hassles, everything covered
under warranty.

Another time I dropped by Barrier because the brakes were squealing just a
little and I wanted to get it checked out. Instead of making me make an
appointment, they immediately had a mechanic sit in the passenger seat while
I took it around the block.

I was in their lot in the last week. The used Boxster I saw had options like
the Sport Touring Package and Boxster red leather interior. 10K over base
isn't necessarily a bad price for that if you want it today. Since PCNA gets
upset with dealers if they sell new cars over MSRP, Barrier buys used
Porsche's because they *can* mark them up. As with any used car, the price
is negotiable and subject to the current market. I doubt they are trading
cars from their allocation to make this happen, because if PCNA found out,
they'd be pissed. No dealer wants to piss off PCNA and lose their
allocation. Usually it is people who can't make their lease payments or some
such and Barrier winds up with a used car.

When you realize that even at MSRP they made about $6K on my car, each
commission is a substantial amount of money to a salesperson. I'd fight,
too, if I was a salesperson and I thought someone else was taking my
customer.

My salesperson said that if he sees any car on the side of the road that has
Barrier license plate holders, they get paid extra by Barrier to stop and
give assistance. (That wasn't enough incentive for me to keep mine, though,
and replaced them with generic black!)

As long as I continue to get the service I've received so far, I'd buy from
them again. And they haven't given me any reason not to use their service.
