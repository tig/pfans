	<<Larry--Why don't you save most of the $500 and just fly down

I would, except that I'm afraid the weather in the passes between
California and Seattle is still going to be pretty bad at that point
especially if the car shows up in late February.  That's all I need is
to end up in a guard rail because of snow or ice after waiting this
long.  If anyone has feedback regarding pass conditions that time of
year coming from North Cal => Oregon, I would love to hear it.  Driving
the car up is still a possible option, since I don't have to decide
final delivery destination for another month or so.

For those of you looking for a Seattle\Eastside service alternative,
I've heard good things about Squires too.  I believe they are a Porsche
certified shop too.

Larry
