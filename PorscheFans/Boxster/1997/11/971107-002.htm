Let me add my note of dissatisfaction as a mail-order parts buyer with
Barrier Motors in the Seattle area.

They advertise extensively in EXCELLENCE magazine and their advertised prices
seem highly competitive.  However, they apparently don't take the time to
properly write down your order or ensure the price advertised is the price
they charge on your Mastercard or VISA account when you order.

Products delivered were defective or poorly packed resulting in damage in
shipment.  Difficult to get corrections or "they're all like that" attitude.
 Promised price corrections when they charged the erroneous amount but failed
to deliver on promise.  Finally gave up with them and my Mastercard/VISA bank
card carrier finally made adjustments unilaterally when Barrier couldn't get
their act together.

Perhaps my experience is the exception (some have noted what I'd term
"marginally satisfactory" local experience with them.)  If not, BEWARE .....

PCNA, where are you (moving from Reno to Atlanta) on dealers like this?????

Perry
