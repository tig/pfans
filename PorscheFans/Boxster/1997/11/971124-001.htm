My Boxter is here finally.
I dropped it off in Zuffenhausen on 10/27 and it is here today.

I am somewhat disappointed by the lack of attention from the Porsche 
salespeople. My call asking when the car would be here last week was 
not returned. Today, I walked in the dealership, my regular sales 
person was not here, I asked another one about my car and he went to 
check... letting me know the car wasn't here. So, armed with patience 
(after 10 months, you learn) I was ready to leave but instead walked 
in the back lot to check out cars and found one very similar to mine. 
It had German license plates, exactly the same options and a mark on a 
seat I recognized...

So I went back to the salesperson...

Question, how much do people pay for insurance, I am paying 
$2400/year, living in San Francisco, and this is my second car, I use 
the other one for commute.

El Nino, here I come !  :-(
