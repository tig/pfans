My arena red/hard top and grey leather arrived in Madison, WI on Friday.
Dealer let me drive it into their garage since they will clean and prep on
Monday for a midday release.  It looks even better than I anticipated.
I'm ready to go cruising despite the threat of winter weather.
I'll keep you posted on initial impressions and experiences.
My only regret is that it arrived 5 days after my best friend died of cancer,
we had planned on a weekend trip as our last adventure together (we've sailed
together for years, our participation in the Tampa-Havana Cup in May was his
last sailing trip).
However, being a fellow sportscar lover, he shared my anticipation for the
past 6 months....
His spirit is with the Boxster and me.
