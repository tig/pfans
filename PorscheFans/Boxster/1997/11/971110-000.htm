Porsches' customer is NOT you the car owner, but the dealership.
Porsche AG (Stuttgart) sells cars to the company that sells you your car.
Porsche AG uses a distributor called Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) to
manage the process of distribution, marketing, service, and leasing.

Porsche auto owners may just be an unfortunate part of the business formula-
from the perspective of the manufacturer, distributor, and dealer base.

Unfortunate for them because we drive their cars at the level advertised for
their performance, they break, we bitch.  Sometimes we don't even drive them
that hard, they break, we still bitch.
Unfortunate for them because they have to deal with us (for the life of the
warranty).  Warranty up, the hedge ratio has diminished by whatever percentile
..

Unfortunate for us because we have great expectations that routinely
disappoint (either in the mother ship PAG, PCNA, or down at the lowest level
- the dealerships.)  
The car fails somehow, the dealer can't fix it or does it wrong, and we limp
home or it sits in the shop for another week (while the fun factor diminishes
with every ka-ching of the loan/lease payment).
Unfortunate for us because we really like to drive the things (not to mention
look at them).

I don't know what they could have been thinking, building this fine Boxster
(having thousands of orders come in during three years of development), then
letting the 'process' of order, allocation & delivery fall apart like an
overripe melon.  Just who in the hell IS in control (or is there ANY)?!
 [Maybe they forgot about the other times new models became popular before
they became real...]

While PCNA can exert certain control over the methods of some dealerships,
it's a whimsical notion to believe they'll ever cut anyone off for being
unscrupulous or low quality.  
Price gouging?  As long as the thread of responsibility doesn't include them,
whatever goes.

I don't know Barriers' ranking on the food chain list but it's highly
unlikely the manufacturer's distributor (PCNA) has enough clout to shut
anyone down.  
What might occur is harsh words and threatened allocations, but the bad ones
will be around as long as they want to be.  No matter how loudly you protest.

Call Fred Schwab (be sure to call him 'Fred'), see if he gives a hooey.
