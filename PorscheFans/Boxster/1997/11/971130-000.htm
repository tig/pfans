Ok folks,

I'm getting real close to ordering the Boxster for european delivery this
summer, but I was up at the San Francisco Auto show yesterday and am having
second thoughts. I'd like to know what other cars people looked at before
buying the Boxster and what the pros and cons are that they came up with.

The new BMW M3 convertible is coming out this summer and BMW actually gives
a 10% discount on Euro deliveries, (unlike Porsche's $1100 surcharge) --
basically paying for the vacation -- and the car has 4 seats which makes it
a little easier to justify (I could get by with a single car - making life
just a little simpler - always one of my goals).  Of course the M3 doesn't
look as good as the Boxster, but it seems likely that it may outperform it.
(is anyone out there using the Boxster as their only car?)

Then of course theres the SLK - sure it doesn't handle like a porsche or is
as good looking as the Boxster, but I don't dislike the looks, and its
probably 10K less expensive when you walk out the door, and it has that
damn cool roof.  Maybe the Benz would be more reliable than the Boxster -
if the comments on this discussion list, and others I've seen, are any
indication.  

Then of course I could always go Japanese - with their rock solid
reliability, and true high-end performance - a used 95 Nissan 300zx would
be a blast, as would the newer Toyota Supra Turbo, or even a used NSX - all
in the hi $20K to $40K range.

Decisions, Decisions... Any thoughts from other people out there who bought
the Boxster after considering some of these cars - what made up your mind?
I'm honestly having a tough time making this decision.

Thanks,

Brian.
