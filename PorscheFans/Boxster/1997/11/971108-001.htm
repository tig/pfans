order (wrong options and tire size) because the dealer made it clear =
that folks were lined up and "If I didn't like the car as is -- no =
problem-- they'd sell it to someone else."  So I took the car but have =

dealers do.. Sell a new care to a "friend of the house"  with an =

600 to 800 miles are on the odo.  The friend gets to drive a new rig for =
a period of time and the dealer gets to resell the car at what ever =
price the market will bear. Porsche NA man not like it but they can't do =
a think about it.
