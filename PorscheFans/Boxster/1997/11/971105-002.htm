I purchased my boxter last March and have had no problems with it until 2
weeks ago.  I noticed several drops of Oil on my garage floor and brought it
into the dealer.  I thought that it was the problem with the seals as
somebody wrote several weeks ago.  However it is not.  After conferring with
Porsche and taking the engine out (I think), the technician said it was a
piece that connects the oil to the engine and that it has a hairline crack.
 The part is not in the US and I have to wait for it to come from Germany.
 That will be approx 7-10 days and then it has to get through customs.  I
probably will not have my car for a month.  I am not happy.  The car went in
the shop on10/22.  The only positive thing is that it is not summer-otherwise
I would be really mad.  I also have had smoke after starting the car but it
goes away as soon as I back down the driveway so I will have to pay more
attention to that when I get the car back.  Anybody have a similiar
experience with this type of oil leak.  Let me know.
