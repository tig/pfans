Sorry I started such a debate about Barrier =96 I realize this is a world=
-wide
list.

I guess if you have good service at Barrier, stick with them.  However, I
did not just make up all those claims about them =96 most of them I can p=
rove
first hand, others are from word of mouth.  My car, for example, was one
that cheated the list (by a previous owner).  Order placed in January 97,
received in March 97, never even on the list.  I know of others like this=
 as
well.  My (ex-)salesperson even told me that they try to accommodate ever=
y
type of customer =96 those who are willing to wait, and those who aren't.
Most of my dealings with sales was earlier in the year, so maybe they hav=
e
tried to clean up their act since then.

As far as the Boxsters on their lot goes, they call them used, but they a=
re
really new in my opinion.  Has anyone ever looked at the miles on those
things?  Most of them are in the low hundreds.  I even had a service rep.=
 at
Barrier tell me that they have an agreement with other dealers/buyers to =
get
cars in for those people who would rather pay a little more to bypass the
list.  I=92m not sure if this is =93illegal=94 in Porsche=92s view, but s=
eems like
bad practice to me.

As for salespeople arguing over who=92s customer you are, not calling you=
,
loosing my check, forgetting to put me on the list, having a 3 week servi=
ce
wait, charging for warranty service, putting the wrong oil in cars, and n=
ot
being sorry about any of it =96 these are just unacceptable.  I had much
better service buying my Toyota at a used car lot.  This is a Porsche
dealership for God=92s sake!  If I am going to shell out nearly $60K, I e=
xpect
top notch, ass-kissing service.  I wonder if they treat 911TS customers t=
he
same way.

Anyway, I=92ll take this topic off the list and deal with it the right wa=
y =96
by writing the people who should know.  I love my Boxster!  It was worth
every hassle I went through to get it.  Just passed 10K miles a few weeks
ago while doing a 2500 mile trip down the coast to San Francisco and back.
Most fun I've ever had with a car.

- Steve
