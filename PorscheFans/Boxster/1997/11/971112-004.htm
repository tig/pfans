> Hey.  Has ANYONE been glad they got this car???

Has anyone NOT been glad they got this car?  I don't care if the
speedometer is off or a couple things go wrong under warranty, since
that's what the warranty is for.  I do care that it's the most fun I've
ever had driving a car.  I plan to keep it for life, and when old age
takes its toll, to be buried in the driver's seat.  You won't have any
regrets with your new toy.

Every night I put the top down and drive home.  (Mind you, it's November
and inclined to get a bit chilly, especially those late nights at work
when I don't leave until 8 or 9 - but that's what the heater is for,
right?)  But someone once told me the only way to keep from going crazy
with work is to leave it at the door by creating a daily ritual of
"saying goodbye" as you exit.

Mine involves putting the top down, and the rear spoiler up.  :)
