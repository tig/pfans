RE: winter tires / John Felker 11/23
Hi John,
Spent a fair amount of time on this so I'm happy to share.
Christophorus did their annual winter tire artical last issue & rated
the Dunlop SP winter sport M2 on top w/Pirelli 210s a close second (I've
used the 210s on my C4/993 the last 2 winters w/good success).  Niether
the Dunlop or Pirelli is avail. in U.S. in Porsche's designated 17" size
(for your & my 17" wheels). Though you could make others work -- I
persued that size, 205/50 F &25/40 R.  I contacted Porsche Technical in
Stuttgart & gave them some static that the only tires that they
recomended in the artical were NOT avail. in those sizes in U.S.
distribution & also, what might they find objectional to the Bridgestone
WT-05, which is avail. but that they did not give mention.
They said -- nothing wrong w/Bridgestone, good tire, just that it's been
in their line a while  -- didn't know how long it would continue.  I
don't know where they got that apprehension and I couldn't get it
confirmed anywhere so now I have the Bridgestones mounted on my other
17"ers ready to go on the car.  They are a directional tire w/a decent
looking sidewall & fairly aggressive tread pattern. Tire Rack $752/set,
other wholesalers as low as $650.So there you go, sorry for the
bandwidth, hope it helps ya.
                                        Gregg
