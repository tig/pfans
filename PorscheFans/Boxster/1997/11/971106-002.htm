Steve -

Feel your pain.  I work at a company located right by Barrier and was trying
to work with them because of their proximity to my office, but was initially
told "18 month wait" in March of this year.  So I started shopping around
for dealers.  Barrier called me a couple of times because they had got
Boxsters in from "out of state" that they "could" sell me for $5-10K over
invoice "just to cover their costs".  I repeatedly declined these cars.

Then I located a dealer in Oakland (Negherbon Porsche) that has been heaven
to deal with and are getting me a car with a January '98 build and Feb\March
delivery.  The issue was that I needed to find a dealer in Washington to
have the car delivered to for a courtesy delivery.  Well again I called
Barrier to see if this was something they could accomodate, due to their
relative proximity to my home and office.  I was transferred to their
"manager" who said that they couldn't take a courtesy delivery because they
would lose money on the deal even by charging $500.  I said that the Tacoma
and Bellingham Porsche Washington dealerships are willing to take courtesy
delivery for $500.  He didn't have a real good explanation for this.  The
unfortunate thing is Tacoma is 40 miles away and Bellingham is about 90
miles.  I explained to him that it would definitely taint my feelings
regarding Barrier and that I probably wouldn't be inclined to bring my
Boxster to Barrier when I recieved it.  The manager went into how Barrier
has the highest volume sales in Washington and already had plenty of
business, blah, blah, blah.

These guys are so arrogant it's incredible.

If anyone is interested in opening a Porsche dealership in the Seattle area,
I think there is a market that is readily looking for a local alternative to
Barrier.  I would definitely drive the 15 miles across the floating bridges
to Seattle for service, especially if it meant not dealing with Barrier.

Larry
