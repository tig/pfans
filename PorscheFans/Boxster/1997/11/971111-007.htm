ok.. here's the lowdown on detectors...

a) if your in the situation that you stand to get a ticket for HAVING a
detector.. your either
   in Virginia or some other state/provence/locale that prohibits radar
detectors... you   
   having the detector is on your own head... but seeing as we know the cars we
have and we 
   know just how hard it is to resist the urge to splurge on the throttle...
one needs some 
   line of defense against traffic violations...

b) for years the radar detector of choice among owners of performance vehicles
of many makes
   has been the Valentine ONE... I have one and am very happy w/ it... have had
it for a year
   and a half now and am very happy w/ it...  it is windshield or sunvisor
mountable and has
   several options as far as wiring it is concerned... as far as taking it off
that simple it
   has a really unique slide in mounter that I just leave on my windshield
since its useless 
   if you don't have the detector so I never think twice about leaving it...
and only remove
   it to put it into my other vehicle... I'm gonna order a second clip so I
won't have to move 
   the clip... just the detector...

   the detector performancewise is top shelf... takes top honors every time it
gets tested...
   and has 360degree LASER, X,Y,Ka... all that stuff
   
   plus should you get a ticket they'll pay it.

   oh and they have a remote indicator screen that plugs into your cigarette
lighter(I don't 
   have that item can't say how well it works or what one would use it for.)

   but you say you want one of those INSTALLED detectors...
   the best one I know of is the K40 one I don't know the range of
effectiveness and all but I
   know how its designed... it has one detector mounted in the front end one in
the rear
   (optional)... and the panel is made to be mounted on the dash right behind
the steering 
   wheel on the guage panel it has a really built in look... not something I
would do to my
   interior but given your situation you gotta do what ya gotta do.

   I didn't know that BEL and WHISTLER were making that kind of detector... I
thought they
   stuck to the little box on your windsheild type... something Valentine
Research is quilty
   of... I thought the STiR was a cordless model... Which reminds me... the
WIRELESS detectors
   are ALL JUNK... stay away... and should you find yourself in a Radio Shack
staring at a 
   carbon copy of a Whistler Detector w/ Radio Shack as the logo instead of
Whistler... step
   away from the counter... put your greenbacks or credit card slowly back into
your wallet
   and go get yourself a cup of coffee and calm down... you have safely averted
buying junk.

   I personally would love to hear other ppl's thoughts on this.
