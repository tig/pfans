<< Then I located a dealer in Oakland (Negherbon Porsche) that has been heaven
 to deal with and are getting me a car with a January '98 build and Feb\March
 delivery.  The issue was that I needed to find a dealer in Washington to
 have the car delivered to for a courtesy delivery. >>

Larry--Why don't you save most of the $500 and just fly down to Oakland and
drive it back?
I did just that last July when I bought a '96 993 from Carleson Porsche in
Palo Alto.
The 870 mile trip to Woodinville could have been done in 1 day, but I got a
late start and stayed overnight in Oregon. All in all, an entirely pleasant
experience, and at a saving of about $7k from what Barrier was asking for
nearly identical cars.

I agree that their sales staff is arrogant, especially the few who have been
there a long time. The little contact I have had w/ the service dept. is ok so
far. I am debating whether to let Barrier do the 15k service or take it
elsewhere, such as Chris's or Squire's in Bellevue.
