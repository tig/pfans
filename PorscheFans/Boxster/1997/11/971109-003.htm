I am trying to decide what is the best radar detector to go with for a
Boxster.  I have two concerns about windshield mounted detectors.  First,
they are easily spotted by the police and from the few police officers I
know, they get a little extra enjoyment out of giving tickets to people with
detectors.  Second, I really don't want to worry about this thing getting
stolen every time I park my car with the top down (or up, for that matter).
I'm already tired of popping the stereo out every time I run into a store.
I hate it when I lock the face plate in the center console (probably unsafe,
but I'm lazy) and then come back out and start my car before I realize that
I need my key to get to my stereo.

So, I started looking at the remote radar detectors on the market.  The only
ones I've seen so far are the BEL 615STiR and the Whistler 2290.  The both
seem fairly comparable - equivalent feature set, detector under the hood,
tiny display hidden somewhere in your car, and optional detector for rear.
Has anyone had success installing one of these things in a Boxster?  Do you
have to run wires from the detector to the display (I assume it is not
wireless).  Has anyone bought the optional rear detector?  Where did you
install it?  Most of them say to mount it to your rear window - don't think
that's going to work.  Are the rear detectors even worth getting?
