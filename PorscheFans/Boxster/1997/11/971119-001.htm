Thanks for all your interest! Although April is a long time off, we need
to give Imperial Palace a realistic idea of how many rooms to hold.
They're not taking reservations yet. Those interested in the event,
please e-mail Mark Lysinger (mlys@cyberramp.net) by Nov 30. You will be
committed & advised of hotel's cancellation policy when you reserve (Feb
or Mar).

Re Valley of Fire (Nevada's first state park): ~1 hour N of Strip; paved
roads, flaming red unreal formations, short walking trails to points of
interest; many photo ops. We once encountered a European crew filming a
commercial for cologne! Re Red Rock Canyon (W of I 15 at base of Spring
Mountains): paved roads, scenery and, the wild burros.

No speedway activities or driving contests! Some will be in the break in
period; hope to have hand held CB's for use while convoying. We'll have
a lead car & tail end Charlie - not going to lose anybody! The idea is
meandering in our beautiful machines, stopping when & where we want,
chatting, comparing, sharing, picture taking, & no tight schedule!

Further updates will be on the same three sites, but first, WE NEED
NUMBERS.

Mark L, Betty & Nita
