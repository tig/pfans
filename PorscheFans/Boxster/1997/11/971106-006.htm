Steve Miller et al.

I agree with Steve's assessment of Barrier's sales staff. That's why I
ended up getting my Boxster from a So. Cal dealership. They were totally
worthless, uncommunicative, and deceitful. And it extended from the
Sales Manager on down to the individual sales people.

And yes, I was the one who was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable
price of my 7500 mile service. I can't believe I've had conventional oil
put in my car. I'm outraged.  I'm not all that enamored of their service
department because they put some fender dings in when they installed my
CD-changer. I can't prove it but I know they did it. But the oil thing
is over the top. How can they continue to be a licensed Porsche
dealership doing shit like that. It's unbelievable.

Can anyone tell me how to distinguish the synthetic from the natural oil
product from looking at the dipstick???
