As soon as I saw this car I was absolutely as smitten as Mr. Toad ("Wind In The Willows" ) was when he first beheld an 
automobile.  I had to have one, and, as of Friday, I do.  It's a white tiptronic with the sports pkg.  ( I rented a Carrera in 
LA a few months ago which had a tip shift and really took a liking to the automatic trans.  I highly recommend 
prospective buyers check this option out, especially if they live in areas with heavy rush hour traffic.)  

I LOVE this car. I have had many cars and I have NEVER gotten off driving a car to this extent before.  The Carrera I 
rented (for $500/day) was a white cabriolet and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  And, I am here to testify that I 
am digging this Boxter every bit as much.  

Husbands -- FYI -- my wife had always been dead set against me getting a Porsche.  Her face grew ashen at the mere 
mention of dropping by a showroom.  However, when we rented the Carrera, and we were tooling down Sunset Blvd. 
with the top down, she did a complete about face.   I was absolutely taken aback by her reaction.  The seemingly 
outrageous $500/day was money well spent.
