No, but I can tell you to stay away from Barrier.  They seem to be abusing
the fact that they are the only dealer in an area that has a lot of money.
They have screwed me from the very start.  In the Sales department...

1) They constantly sell list positions to the highest bidder.
2) They trade new Boxsters with other dealers so they can mark them up -
their lot has several new Boxsters for 10K over MSRP.
3) Their sales people are very competitive with each other.  I had two argue
over who saw me first, and then they each bad-mouthed the other in private.
4) They never call you or check in - they lost my deposit and didn't stick
me on the list for 2 months after I gave them the money.

In the Service department...

They have a 3 to 4 week wait just to get your car in.  When I finally got my
car in for the first time, they didn't even move it for the entire day.
They then had the nerve to tell me I would have to make another appointment
to bring it in - "How does 3 weeks from today sound" the guy says.  So, I
waited three more weeks and got it back in.  Guess what - my car sat on
their lot for an entire day again!  This time I screamed and yelled and they
said they would keep it over night and fix it first thing in the morning.  I
called the next day at 4:00pm and got the phone shuffle to some pawn who
said they were just rolling it into the shop.

Just when I thought I couldn't be any more upset with their service, they
tried to charge me $150 for warranty service!  All they did was tighten a
loose door handle and replace a faulty seatbelt.  I had to argue this one
for 20 minutes before they reluctantly dropped the charges and made it sound
like a favor to me.

Once last thing that really bothered me.  They said they NEVER use synthetic
oil in Boxsters.  They said it is too expensive and it doesn't matter
anyway.  I couldn't believe their ignorance.  After a huge debate, they said
I could bring in my own oil if I really cared that much, but they thought
that was kind of anal.  Anyone else on this list have their oil changed at
Barrier?  Do you know what they put in it?  I think I remember one person on
this list saying that Barrier had cheap oil changes - maybe that's why.

Anyway, sorry to go off topic.  Some of this is pretty recent and my blood
pressure is still high.  I too would love to find an alternate in the
Seattle area, but the only other dealers in the state are in Tacoma and
Bellingham.  Is it possible to still get warranty service from a non-dealer?
