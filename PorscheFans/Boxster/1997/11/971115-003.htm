Boxter Owners,

I'm looking at buying a Boxter - but one area of concern is that of door
dings - from the idiots who park next to you and open their doors rather
forcefully into your's.

Yeah, this may be a trivial issue - but when you drop $40 or $50K on a car
you don't want the doors to look like they've been attacked by a band of
marauding geese, a week after picking it up.  I also tend not to want to
have to search out the far corner of the parking lot to avoid the chance
that anyone will park beside you.

I see a lot of 300zxs with entirely messed up doors, and remember 928s with
the same problem until they put on the stripes of protectant down the side.  

So, the question remains, how resistant to dings are the doors - have
owners been conscious of this as a problem?

Brian
