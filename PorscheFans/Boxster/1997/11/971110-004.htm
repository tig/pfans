RE: Barrier & "Big Picture" from P.Schiemer

Sorry but your last sentence (call Fred Schwab) was about all I could
agree with. Up until that it sounded like we should all throw in the
towel, get Chevys, to resist is futile.
Seriously, we ARE the consumer, Porsche IS the manufacturer.  By
definition in a free market that relationship allows ample room between
us for both parties to screw it up pretty good. Plenty of room for the
manufacturer's distribution & support programs to succeed or fail.
Plenty of room for us as consumers to make good or bad decisions on
where to buy the product (or whether the product's even right for us).

Lets face it, this whole experience isn't for everyone.  Personally I
love driving the cars this little German company makes, everything else
is just part of getting to that end. Porsche IS concerned about PR
(they're not obsessed w/it). Fortunately they are still in business are
still obsessed w/ building great cars.    Gregg
