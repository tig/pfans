I also found was not comfortable with the answer I was getting from =
Barrier when I placed my name on a list so I went to Tacoma.  I expect =
to be able to place the order in the next few months, so I can't say I =
am sure I won't face the same problems that others have at Barrier.  At =
times, I have had more accurate information about options, pricing etc. =
than they have, but in general it appears they are being straight with =
me. We will see. =20
Barrier wanted to make me #120 on their list for a $1000 deposit.  I =
probably would have ordered the car after the turn of the  year 2000.
