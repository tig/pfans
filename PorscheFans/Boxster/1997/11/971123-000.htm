The Air Bag light thing has occured on my car.  It was fixed and has NOT
recurred.

Do you have the heated seats? I found the error occured on my car when
the passenger seat was occupied and the passenger's heated seat turned
on.

Also, my mechanic called PCNA ans was told the airbags remain
operational, the light only indicated that an error conlifct had
occured.

I saw a couple of people post that they had problems with their airbag
warning light either coming on intermittently or staying on all the
time - and I can't remember a definitive resolution - so I apologize in
advance if this duplicates a previous post.

ANYWAY...

A few days ago, my airbag warning light came on for no apparent reason
and it has stayed on ever since.  I called the dealer to find out what I

should do.  They had seen a few of these problems already.  They relayed

to me that they have to get some sort of a kit/part from the dealer and
replace a part or parts on the seatbelt mechanism.  Those kits are
currently on backorder (sounds like this is really a first year
production problem) and they said that they will order one for me and
let me know when it comes in.  They said that there should not be any
adverse effects to the cars safety systems - it is an erroneous warning
(although red idiot lights still make me uncomfortable).

Hope this info helps to clarify the situation should it happen to you.
