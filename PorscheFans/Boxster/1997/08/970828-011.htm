What is your reasoning behind this?  In fact, I believe the opposite to be
true.  There are several advantages to replying over sending a new post.  If
I am missing something, please correct me.

First, when replying the subject doesn't change (except for the addition of
the RE:).  Many mail programs will automatically group messages together by
thread.  If everybody sends a new post, this whole concept is broken.  Also,
it becomes hard to tell which mails are questions and which mails are
answers.  Even if your mail program doesn't support message threading, it is
still nice to be able to scan mails for the first occurrence of a subject
that does not contain "RE:" to find the root of a discussion.

Second, it is nice to quote the person you are replying to - something that
you get for free by selecting reply.  In a new post, you would have to cut &
paste and maybe even add a bunch of ">" in front of the quote to distinguish
it from your text.

A few things to remember when replying.  If you going to mail to (or even CC)
the whole group, you don't need to add people's name to the "To:" line or
"CC" line that are members of the group.  This will just result in them
getting two copies of the mail.  Also, it is nice to reduce the original mail
to what you are replying to, rather than quoting the entire original mail. 
Nobody likes to get a 1 line reply to a multi-page mail that quotes the
entire original mail.  It is also nice to state the name and email of the
person you are replying to.
