     The pulls are mechanically prevented from lifting if the 
     driver door is closed.  The pulls connect directly to the 
     latches through cables; no relay is involved.
     
     Porsche has done a nice job of covering all those things, 
     both from the top side and the bottom, but it is a pain when 
     you then have to get to something you aren't supposed to 
     have to get to.
     
     I just hope I don't have to get into the front trunk for any 
     reason before I get the car into the dealer next week for 
     oil change and cable replacement.  My concern is that they 
     will not have cables available, and it will have to be 
     "ordered".

Well I read that mesage about secure storage with interest. According to 
what I read in the manual the pulls inside the car actually don't 
actuate the cable, they actuate a relay or something, that then does the 
cable, and therefore the trunks are secure. I tried this little 
experiment a while a go. Parked the car, locked the doors with the 
remote locking thing and then waited about a minute. Then I reached in 
(the windows were down) and pressed the unlock button. Nothing happened, 
so I pulled the door handle. and the alarm went off. I don't think to 
the door would open, but I'll have to try
