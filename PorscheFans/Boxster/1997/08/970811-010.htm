if you want a turbo boxster you need to shell out $16k to gemballa - 
that's the only turbo option i know of.  it actually sounds like a 
pretty good deal - a sub $60k boxster with 300 horses.  my guess is it 
would be awesome.

also, i think it's interesting that all these dealers "confirm" the new 
engine - i've heard "confirmations" of 2.5 w/more hp, 2.8, and 3.0 - the 
best answer i got, however, was from berkeley johnston who got this 
answer from pag while he was in stuttgart - "we don't know yet what the 
's' engine will be."
