My husband and I purchased the boomerang after reading about/ hearing about/
and seeing, first-hand,  Boxsters with damaged front ends.  The reason was
not only cosmetic.  The plastic bumper doesn't just scratch upon impact, it
scrapes, tears or even creases.  Just behind are the front bumper are the
car's condensors and radiators.  If these suffer a direct hit (as did one in
my dealer's body shop) you have a major problem.  The steel boomerang
significantly strengthens this very vulnerable area.

In addition, if you do indeed end up with several years of nicks and dings
(and I believe most of us certainly will), the bar can easily be removed and
repolished for just a few dollars.  No need to repaint at resale time.

Someone mentioned that we only buy these kind of protective devices out of
fear.  True.  That's why we also purchased the alarm, the extended
warranty... and yes, we even have life insurance!

I have no interest in anyone buying this product.  I simply wanted to express
my views on this excellent bit of protection.
