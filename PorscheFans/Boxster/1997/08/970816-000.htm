>>Any idea what items being "insecure" might cause the horn to beep?<<

Check that lockable center console latch, it too is wired to the alarm
system.

A rule of thumb regarding auto security is, if they want it bad enough,
they'll get it- even with the most sophisticated alarm.
If what you have is important enough to you to secure properly, in your hands
is probably the best place for it (or nearby).

I parked the Boxster at a hotel in a place very unfamiliar to me recently,
was quite concerned about safety.  Called security, asking them to check on
it in their rounds.  "Aw hell, we don't do rounds."  he said, "Whataya think
the crime lights are for?"

Planning a ten day trip to an auto event in New York (upstate) starting next
week.  I'm making no special consideration with respect to security (beyond
the remote alarm I already have).  
I'll let you know how I fared upon return.
