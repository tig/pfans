Good choice. Love mine.

Did the Easy Lift Off thing. worked great, came off all in one piece, no
problem. Tough part is the adhesive. Tried Alcohol, WD-40, adhesive
remover... still have an uneven shiny 'film' of glue that I can't get off.
Nothing's damaged the plastic so far, but I'm hesitant to try anything
harsher. Let me know if your Goo-Gone works.

See Larry Reynolds care tips. They're posted on a number of PCA sites, I
know they're on the Sacramento region's site (don't have the URL handy just
now, but shouldn't  be hard to find.) in the Tech Tips section.
www.boxster.org (Mark Christenson's site) has a Boxster care page with a
lot of the stuff from PorscheFans compiled.


> This thing corners

Met a few motherf*ckers over the years, wasn't too impressed with how they
handled anything.

Phil.
