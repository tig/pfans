I ordered mine in June from the dealership in Delaware.  In the interim, I am
really enjoying the daily e-mails with euphoric reviews from those who had
the foresight to order early.  

For a change of pace, however, I direct your attention to an ambivalent
review by a British auto writer (Stephen Bayley), page 73 from GQ, titled
Never Mind The Boxster - There isn't too much wrong with the new Porsche . .
.. until you compare it to the 911.

Now do not despair.  It is in balance a very up beat review.  However, the
author does have criticism (remember he is paid to find fault).  See the
following quotes for the critical portions of the review:

"Porsche has done it again.  By which I mean just like the 914, the 924, the
928,the 944 and 968, Porsche has failed to create a car that is meaningfully
better than the antique 911."

"But for all its coruscating excellence, Boxster somehow under-performs in
those last influential percentages where neutral curiosity becomes passion
and passion shades into obsessive conviction."  I had to look up
"coruscating."  It means "sparkling."  

"A technically great car which fails the ultimate test of stimulating
irrational longings.  Why?

First the body.  It's uncomfortably wide for what should be a compact car.  .
.. . Not so with the Boxster: its swollen hips impose an unreasonable caution,
like two fat ladies potholing.  . . .  the Boxster's body was the inevitable
expression of idas intended to seduce dealers attending the Detoit Motor
Show.  . . . The Boxster certainly looks interesting, but perhaps not good:
its proportions are wrong.  The standard joke is that you can't tell whether
it's coming or going."

"There are deficiencies in the interior ergonomics too. . . For instance,
windscreen reflections are severe and, on occasions, frightenigly diverting,
while the three-quarter rear view with the hood up is dangerously obscured,
making motorway manoeuvres something of a lottery.  Also, the steering wheel
or seat squab badly need adjustment - I found it difficult to get
comfortable, and a journey of less than 200 miles left me with a bad shoulder
ache."

"Bump absorption is, however, very poor.  I was even less pleased with the
engine: the new water-cooled flat-six feels muffled and asthmatic compared to
the febrile, tungsten, whang-whang-whang of the old-air-cooled motor.  You'd
think 200-odd horsepower should be enough to keep you with the programme, but
I found after a week on the motorways of Britian that the Boxster wasn't
always able to pull away quite fast enough from the outside lane slew of
Vectras and Mondeos.  Hmmm"

"But for the time being, the Boxster is not quite there.  It's the first
Porsche to be the product of a marketing directive rather than an engineering
one . . . and it shows."

Let's hear some response to these thoughts from all you euphoric Porschefans.
