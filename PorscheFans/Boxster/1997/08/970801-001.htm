After hearing all of the horror stories people are having with their
dealers, I wanted to pass along a dealer recomendation. . . Hendrick
Porsche in Charlotte N.C.  My Boxster saga began with them over two years
ago, and at every step in the process they have been professional and
knowladgeable.  Michael Falcone (their boxster expert) and Dale Knorzer
(General Sales Manager) have been terrfic on the sales and information
side, their parts and service team have also been great at diving in and
dealing with the minor issues that have surfaced on my early production
baby. I've been corresponding privately with some of the list members
who've have trouble with their dealers, those that have switched to
Hendrick have found them a great change of pace.  One word of warning,
their waiting list is not any shorter than anyone elses.

Sorry if this sounds like a commerical, (I'm just a customer of theirs, no
kickbacks or commissions!), but I did want this group to know not everyone
is pissed off at their dealers.  Now if they could only speed up the
delivery of my "S".


Cheers, RC
