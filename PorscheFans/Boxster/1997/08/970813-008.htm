If they're willing to cut the roof or break a window, you're
out of luck.  They can get into virtually any car this way.

Not true.  Most modern cars have trunk pop from inside the 
cabin, using exactly the same setup as the Boxster does.

The fact is, if they're willing to break a window and/or cut
the roof open, they're going to get whatever it is they're
looking for, other than in a very few cars from which the
trunk can't be opened from inside, or in which the trunk can
be locked to prevent this from happening.  They probably
exist, but I've never driven a car with this feature.  Even
then, if they're breaking windows etc., there's also a 
distinct likelihood they're willing to take a screwdriver to
the trunk lock, so you'd likely be robbed anyway.
