The most common issue that seems to cause the beep for me is when  the
console between the seats is not  fully latched.  Usually happens when I
take the radar detector down from the windshield, toss it in the
console, and lock it.  It sometimes does not "seat", and the car beeps
when I activate the alarm.  I just raise the lid a few inches, close it
firmly, and try again.  That usually does it. (I also once tried to
activate the alarm with the passenger door open, system didn't like that
either!)
