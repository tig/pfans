Jim,

    I understand were you are coming from but remember: YOu buy a $400
tailpipe as as on option. THen 8% luxury tax ($32), sales tax 6% here in
Ky ($24) that is $456 for it. OR you can buy it mail order for $290 (no
Lux tax nor sales tax if order from an out of state dealer) just
shipping $15 and have it installed which whould take no more than 10
minutes! But at Porsche Dealer shop cost that may  COST, but you can do
it!  If I was close I would be glad to install it for $150.

Things like floor mats, and door sills are easy!  The floor mats are the
clear choice!

I just wanted to open the eyes of those ordering and give them an
alternative!

There are no Exhaust, or body work options from Prosche. The CD changer
is the only audio option.

I would recommend that people get the HARDTOP from the Factory with the
car (the only way to get it right now) becuase of paint and fit conerns.

One thing no one has  mentioned is that aftermarket "options" will not
appear on the sticker on the underside of the hood and how this will
effect concours.
