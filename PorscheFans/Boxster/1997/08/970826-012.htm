Two questions:
1) If space is not critical but concerns of dirt and exposure to rubber
compenents in an unheated garage located in the Northeast is, could a
dolly be a preferable alternative to the hardtop hoist. I could go
either way but am concerned that the hoist approach would expsoe the not
inexpensive hardtop to wide temperature swings, gather cobwebs, dust and
the like.

2)Although the boomerang has been much discussed and
porschefxdesigns@worldnet.att.net offered to sell me the boomerang, can
it be purchased through a Porsche dealer... or is it strictly after
market?  I do have a modest concern that the dealer will hose me or be
otherwise uncooperative in the installation process if not purchased
from the dealer.

Any gentle responses would be appreciated. All the Porsches lists seem
to have their tense and judgemental moments.  In that spirit, thanks in
advance.
