     P-fans,
     
     Sorry this is so long, but I am rather excited about my new Boxster.  
     I took delivery of my 5-speed, P-63 Sports package, triple black, US 
     spec car last Friday and have not stopped smiling since.  The sound of 
     the engine alone is worth the price of admission!  In low gear, the 
     engine sounds either like a choir singing or a tortured ghost wailing 
     depending on the RPM.  I can't wait until the 1000 mile break-in 
     period is over to really open it up.  
     
     A day trip to the Southern California desert via the twisty mountains 
     demonstrated a very competent stock suspension - just point and go.  
     The engine ran a little on the warm side (at the 215 degree F mark) 
     while aggressively climbing the mountains in 100+ F degree weather 
     with the A/C but returned to the 180 degree mark afterward. 
     
     The car is definitely a head-turner.  People gawking, pointing and an 
     occasional "look, there's a Boxster" are common.  This does, however, 
     have a downside.  A Toyota Corolla with two women aboard were trying 
     to keep pace with me in the next lane while in stop-and-go traffic.  
     Unfortunately, there were so busy looking at the car, they failed to 
     see the SUV in front had slowed from 30MPH to around 10MPH.  The two 
     women hit the SUV while still accelerating.  Fortunately nobody was 
     injured although I do believe their car was totaled.
     
     The only problem with the car so far is a slight wind and probably 
     water leak on the passenger side gasket where the roof joins with the 
     windshield header.
     
     Contrary to some of the recent postings, my dealer charged list price 
     plus the required sales and luxury tax as well as California vehicle 
     registration.
     
     I purchased the GE Capital 6 year, 72000 mile extended warranty 
     since I plan to keep the car.
     
     Here's a question for the P-car gurus:
     
     Is it safe to use a car cover on a car barely a month old?  I would 
     think the paint would still be pretty soft unless Porsche cures the 
     paint at the factory.  The car cover I purchased from Automotion 
     (Storm Shield) recommends not covering a repainted car during the 
     first 6 months.  Does this apply to a new car as well?
     
     Thanks in advance,
     Mike
