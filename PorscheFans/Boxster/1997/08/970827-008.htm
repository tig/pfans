I bought my Boomerang from Ogner Porsche in Woodland Hills, CA.  My dealer
installed it on my new bumper in 20 minutes.  Although they didn't charge me
because of other work I had done, they said they would normally ask $45.00 to
put it on.  (after seeing it, they are going to start carrying it)  

Since the steel bar is predrilled, installation was very simple - just a
matter placing the boomerang against the underside of the bumper, and
attaching it with stainelss steel screws.  I could have done it myself.   And
you can't see it from above.

I dealt driectly with Jeff Korda (a Porsche mechanic with alot of experience)
- a very smart guy and very pleasant to talk to.  No pressure at all to
buy...

By the way, before I put this on I called the Porsche line to get their
imput.  Off the record, the rep admitted they have had several reports of
front bumper damage and thought this was an excellent idea.

For those interested Ogner's number is 1 888 693-3772
