Hi  All!

As a new Boxster owner, I have three questions for older Boxster owners who have
more experience with the car:

1) With the hardtop installed, the "top open" light on the dashboard is staying
lit.  Is this normal or should it go off? ( I haven't had a chance to go to the
dealer to ask)

2) What does the US manual say about break in period? My car is a US spec car,
but the manual I got is in Spanish and is a European manual; it states a break
in period of 600 miles (1000 km) at no more than 5000 RPM's.

3) My dealer suggested not waxing the car for a couple of weeks to allow time
for the paint to breathe after washing the cosmoline (<sp?> that greyish stuff
they ship the car covered with) off.  Does this sound right to you? Doesn't
sound too reasonable to  me, I would think waxing immediately would seal the
paint in it's best condition <shrug>.

TIA!

Saludos,
Carlos
