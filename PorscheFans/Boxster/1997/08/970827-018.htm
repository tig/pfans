< Boxster "not quite a Porsche?" and "in the same vein as the 914">
The Boxster is all Porsche. Four years ago it came from a clean sheet of
paper, Porsche did it all.  Unlike the 914 the the 986 will evolve in
Porsche's line for many years.

<whats the most desirable Porsche to own for pure driving pleasure &
appreciation>
Well Steve thats a pretty subjective question,  whats YOUR pleasure, or
for that matter, whats your driving? -- curvy country rds, PCA track
events, weekend fun, distance touring? All 3 of my cars are distinctly
different, not really better or worse. No doubt about it, the Boxster is
an all-around fun drive.
Don't think that 'appreciation'(or depreciation) should really be in the
criteria here (these are great fun cars, not stock investments). For me,
if it isn't a real kick to drive (and to look at) no amount of good
return on investment will keep it in my garage.

Regarding your question on getting an air-cooled 993 before the 996s
come out?  The 996 will probably be a great car. We'll probably sit in
it & forget what came before. But right now I think the 993 is a super
automobile and it's pretty hard to imagine anything sounding better than
that air-cooled 3.6 boxer.  It is the highest evolution of the
first/best 35 years of the air-cooled 911 and that s/b worth something.
