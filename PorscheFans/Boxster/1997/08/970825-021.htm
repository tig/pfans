If you don't agree with the AutoWeek article on Boxster vs. Corvette,
they encourage you to respond in the Poll column this week which
reads:

    "If you had to choose one for your own, would it be the Chevrolet
    Corvette or the Porsche Boxster?  Please respond with your name,
    address and phone number via fax (1-313-446-1027) or e-mail
    (epoll@AutoWeek.com) by Sept. 1."

Just to get you all fired up, I'll quote their last paragraph in the
article:

    "...the C5 Corvette doesn't drive like a big car, but it does have the
    feel of an awesome one.  The charms of the slower Boxster are more
    subtle;  you can pay less attention to driving it, but you have to pay
    more attention to appreciate it.  That's the difference between the
    two.  It all gets down to:  The C5 redefines the Corvette experience.
    The Boxster feels like a fantastic little sports car, and the C5
    Corvette feels like a supercar.  We'll take the Corvette."
