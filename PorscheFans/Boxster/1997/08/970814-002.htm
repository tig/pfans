     Of course, you have to be willing to bake anything that you 
     store in the rear trunk.  The heat is probably not good for 
     things like a laptop, and is bad for thinks such as disks.
     
     I use the front trunk for most of my storage, and I avoid 
     parking the car in places where I feel it is threatened, and 
     count somewhat on the general public's lack of specific 
     knowledge about Boxsters.  That being the case, why would 
     most thieves want to open "the engine compartment".

James:
     
The Boxster's rear trunk is opened by a solenoid, not a cable... 
Correct?
     
If so, you may want to trigger the alarm and see whether the 
trunk-release still works.  Many cars disable the electric 
trunk-release while the siren's sounding; perhaps the Boxster does, 
too.
