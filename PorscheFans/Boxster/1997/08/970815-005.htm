On my wife's Z3, locking the doors also locks the trunk. Once locked, 
neither the doors nor the trunk can be unlocked (even from the 
inside) without the key or alarm transmitter.

My '91 MR2 Turbo (which has a remote trunk release) has this feature 
on the rear trunk (as well as two locking compartments in the cabin). 
Very handy when leaving it parked with the T-tops out. I must say 
that I'm surprised that Toyota would pay more attention to details 
like this than Porsche (he says ducking the impending napalm barrage 
:-).

Agreed, nothing can provide absoute protection against a determined 
criminal but lockable storage can deter opportunistic thieves. For 
people like me who hate to put the top in/up just to run into the 
video store on the way home from work, it gives me peace of mind to 
know that nobody's going to get the laptop out of my trunk without at 
least attracting some attention.
