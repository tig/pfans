Can anyone explain to me how a metal piece can save the radiator and other
crucial parts?
As far as I know, the Boomerang is attached to the underneath of the
bumper, right?
So if you hit something, how can it protect you apart from the sratches?
If it only saves you on the scratches, then I probably wouldn't want one.

Confused,,

Alberto.
