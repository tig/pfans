Howdy,

Just back to Porschephiles after many months of no time...

They are apples and oranges really, times have changed too
much to compare. But even by numbers the '72 is significantly
better in some ways, like acceleration 1/4 mile time, 0-60 etc.
all due to like 500 pounds less weight. Handling is better on the
boxster in almost every way but it does not have that same
race car feel where you are one with the car. Styling is subjective,
ask again in 25 years ;-).

As far as price, the '72 911S was $12,500 - twice the corvette 
(like the new 993 is now) so the boxster would be more like the
'73 914/2.0 which was 50 cents less than an corvette.
So the fun/dollar ratio is great, even better than the 914 (maybe).

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S
