Since a few folks responded to my earlier message I thought I'd respond
to all of them at once:

Sorry - the opinion of the person perpetrating this is of no value.  I'd
like something a little more objective if you don't mind.  Let's get
someone from Porsche on the record on this topic and settle it once and
for all.

Nice analogy.  Freudian, but effective.  I see your point that since
there is no structural (i.e. frame) attachment, it is unlikely to direct
force into the body of the car and in fact may act to dissipate it.  I'd
agree with you if you were correct, but I don't think you are:  it's
straightforward physics - the force has to go somewhere and something
has to absorb it.  It is unlikely that the boomerdoodad will convert
30mph of forward motion into heat (and if it did you'd have the
completely different problem of the nose of the car melting into a
puddle of plastic goo).  So there's still a trade-off:  If one attaches
a crumple-protector in an area designed to crumple, what does it cost
you when it doesn't crumple as designed?  I'm thinking that it probably
wrinkles some other part of the car instead of the bumper.

If, in fact, the boomerflootchie is supposed only to prevent cosmetic
creases in the plastic nose from low impact (<15mph) collisions, that's
one thing.  However, it's being touted here as a radiator-saver at
highway speeds (q.v. the "I hit a (piece of road
junk/curb/speed-bump/pothole/armadillo) and it cost me $1000 to repair"
stories we've seen lately).  What evidence is there that it will in fact
save one's radiator in the event of a collision, and up to what speed is
it effective?  Without test data like this one is buying a promise which
may or may not turn out to be true, and you won't find out until you
have an accident. 

How about this:  if this thing is supposed to protect my radiators, will
the manufacturer pay the first $300 of the costs to fix them when it
fails to do so?  That would show that the manufacturer is willing to put
his money where his mouth is.
