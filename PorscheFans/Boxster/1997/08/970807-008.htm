Hi Boxster Fans,

I've been thinking about doing a "registry" page for some time, and an
email from Perci Hala (who no longer brakes for corners :-) prompted me to
get off my butt and start asking. I think it'd be fun to see how many cars
have been delivered (at least to those of us in cyberspace), what
colors/options people are getting, and how long it took. If you would like
to be listed, please email me the following info:

1) Name and email address (it'd be easiest if you include the email address
in the body of the email, though I can obviously get it from the header :-)
2) Color (interior and exterior)
3) Major options (P38, P63, etc.)
4) Deposit date (when you plopped down your thousand dollars to get in
line, not
when you officially placed the order) and your delivery date. It will be a
lot of fun to see how long people waited!
5) An image (.jpeg is best, but anything will work) if you have one.

Additionally, I'd like to do a Boxster-watch page - for those of us not
lucky enough to be driving yet.  Send the same info, except in place of the
delivery date you can send the order date (if you're lucky enough to have
one of those :-)  And of course there won't be any images :-(

Please reply to this address (not my hotmail address that i usually use for
posting here) :-)

Mark
