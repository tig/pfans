Alas I think it was me that first raised the kinetic energy issues.  I may
well be wrong on that count.

The boom-a-thingy I understand to be pre-drilled for mounting on the lower
edge of the nose.  Importantly this is not a structural part of the car and
so dispersing the impact across the length of the nose may well result in
less cosmetic damage in minor impacts.

Strangely we're not hearing from the Boomer-thingy people on this list
server, so they're marketing folks should be taken outside and shot.  I
think they would say in their defence (defense?) that it will be effective
in minor situations and result in less expensive damage in more significant
impacts.  Past that and despite Rick's attempts to assert his
kitchen-physics analogies <g> I am sure that the energy of the impact is
not dissipated by the Boomer-widget, it's just transferred over a larger area.
One could conjecture that where that energy is spent may well be further up
the nose at its mounts, resulting in unseen cracking of the mounts (perhaps
adversely changing low speed impact absorption behaviour) and in a more
prominent cosmetic places (unsightly if nothing else.)

Options to the consumer, as ever:
1. Abstinence is the best option -- don't hit anything and drive your prize
possession with caution.
2. The Boomer-twangy isn't all that expensive and it's unseen and hardly
heavy, so put it on if you wish to experiment, but unless the vendor can
provide impact tests to proove their case, it's just a promise of benefit.
3. Do nothing.

Is the Boomer-doover available for Corvettes, RX7's, Lambo's, Ferrari's
etc.?  How do these 'nosey', low slung types handle the risk?

On personal tack, this thing has generated a lot of chit-chat.  It doesn't
have a clear 'value proposition' just an argument that if you don't have
it, bad things might happen to you.  It's pretty well marketed for the
Boxster and that perhaps reflects on the Boxster owner profile.  I don't
see it available for similar cars, implying it is a direct marketing
exercise, not an innovative technology or invention so much as a niche
market device (and 'device' in the perjorative sense of something created
by marketing types to make money.)
