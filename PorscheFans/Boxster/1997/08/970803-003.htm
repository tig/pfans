I am a newer member of the "digest" list.  I have a couple questions
based on recent posts:

1.   I have ordered my Boxster (turquoise/graphite
grey/P38/hardtop/more) and have been told by my dealer that it will be
delivered late Sept/early Oct as one of the first 98s. Recently there
were posts that turquoise is no longer available.  I have seen a  lot of
info about the special colors being discontinued, but this is the first
I had heard of turquoise being dropped (other than a rumor several
months ago that was not true), and my dealer has no such info nor has my
order been rejected.  What is the source of the info that turquoise is
out?  

2.   I have seen several posts about the "boomerang" and found a photo
on one of the many great Boxster pages, but have seen nothing that tells
me what it does.  Can someone help?

Thanks.
