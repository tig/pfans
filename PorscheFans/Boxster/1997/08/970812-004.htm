Any of the 3" harnesses will work in the Boxster.  For the shoulder harness,
use the wrap around type and wrap them around the horizontal bar behind the
seats. The seat belts need  different sides for each side of the same seat
Outside mount - use a standard eye bolt that comes with most units.  It
should screw right in and u can still use the regular belt. The belt will be
the snap in kind.
Inside mount - Remove the seat at the 4 mounting bolts, requires a Torx
socket.
 careful to not scratch the consul with the bottom of the seat. Loosen the 17
mm bolt that holds the seat belt to the seat.  Replace the bolt with a longer
one ( it is an American standard thread, NOT METRIC. The belt has to be the
standard mount type with a metal end with hole.  Mount this with the orginal
seat belt end back onto the car and reinstall.  
If u want a submarine belt the best way is to buy a small flat piece of metal
bar (hardware store) and drill 2 holes in it that will match the holes of the
front seat.  Mount it with the seat on top.  Before installing use a D type
ring ( like the link on a chain ) and slide it over the metal bar.  Attach
the sub belt to the D ring.  I leave the inside belt in the car and remove
the rest after a track event.  No holes to drill. Good luck.
