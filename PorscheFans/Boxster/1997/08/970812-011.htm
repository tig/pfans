Whoops.  That's what I get for cut & paste editing mail 
without proofreading.  Duh.  {Sheepish grin}

All true.  Nonetheless, 6.1 is a _lot_ closer to 6.0 than it is 
to 6.7.  If three test figures are printed, 6.0, 6.1, and 6.7, 
which do you think is most likely to be erroneous?  

I had the impression that you were asserting that Motor Trend's 
measurement was off the mark, and I was responding by saying that 
the fact that Car and Driver got numbers closer to Motor Trend's 
than Porsche's would tend to refute this.  (Or so I hope, anyway,
and all this assuming you find Car and Driver believable.)  :)
