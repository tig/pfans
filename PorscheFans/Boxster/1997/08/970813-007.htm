All this talk about trunks leads me to the following question:

Is there anywhere to store anything in the Boxster that is relatively
secure?

Let's say you have a laptop computer or video camera you are carrying
with you and you don't want to take it into some place you stop at.
You want to leave it in the car.  Where do you leave it?

Both trunks can be opened by anyone as long as they have opened the
driver's door.  The doors can be unlocked by anyone when the top is
down by either reaching in and pushing the button on the dash or by
opening up the door using the inside door release (twice).

Even if you have the optional alarm, that's not going to be enough to
stop someone from a pop-n-grab of your laptop.

Even if you have the top up, they can easily cut the roof to access
the unlock-door button on the dash.  Or break the window, of course.

Other cars don't immediately grant access to the trunk when an
intruder gains access to the passenger area.

About the only locked storage in the car is the between-the-seats
storage console, and it feels like I could break open without any
tools.

It would be nice if the trunk release area had a key slot where you
could optionally lock the trunks so that a person couldn't open the
trunks without the key.

Am I resigned to not carrying anything of value in the car?

Thanks,
