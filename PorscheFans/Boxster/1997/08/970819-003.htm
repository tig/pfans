.... but i know there are more people out there who either have a boxster in
their driveway or at least have one on order.  heck, there are over 500
people on this list - i would guess at least a third either own or are
waiting to own.

there are two main benefits to getting on the registry or boxster watch
pages at my site:

1)  you can communicate issues/questions/concerns with owners who have
similar cars.  if i get enough interest i'll open up the options section to
be more comprehensive (currently i'm only listing options over $1k - saves
typing quite a bit).  yes, you can do essentially the same thing on the
p-fans list.

2)  with more people on the registry/watch pages it makes these web sites
that exist appear as more legitimate forums to the big guys in
reno/stuttgart.  if there were several hundred people on the registry it
becomes much more likely that pcna/pag would bend an ear our way if a
complaint arises.  i can produce logs showing more than 30 or 40 (the
current number of registered owners/waiters) but the odds of those making a
difference to a fred schwab are basically zero.  a large list of owners,
when you figure the relatively small percentage of porsche owners who are
probably wired, would mean something.

3)  ok, there's arguably a third benefit - you can show off a picture of
your own car on the registry pages!

one more time, the info i'm looking for is:

name/email
color (ext/int)
major options
deposit date
delivery date (or eta for those of us waiting)
send an image if you have one (again, the waiters won't have one)

if you have questions or concerns, please email me directly (i.e. skip the
list).

thanks,

mark
