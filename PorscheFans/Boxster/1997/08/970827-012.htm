It has a long throw and it has the 'spongey', elastic feel of any cable
shift -- in fact worse than some Honda front wheel drive cars.
Nevertheless, it has a quick (if long) action and it has a good
'selectivity' feel.  It is a disappointment and will not last long I'm sure.

Conventional gearboxes are obsolescent and may be a thing of the past soon
enough if the BMW sequential shifting six speed makes its way into the 996
and later the Boxster.

For me, the Getrag six speed is the best feel of a conventional box (in
some vettes, some M3's and some Australian muscle cars) but needs double
syncro on first and second.  The MX5/Miata shifter (not the gearbox, just
the shift kit) is the most accurate, tactile box I've used.  The 911 box is
pure and enjoyable but sometimes feels like a metal stick in a bag of
marbles (sorry, that's harsh.)  I've not driven more than one old Ferrari,
a 308GTS, but it was sweet and I recently drove an early 90's Mondial and
that was pure, crisp, almost exhilarating -- more so than the rest of the
car, I'm afraid.

So, how say you on shifters and has anyone heard of a kit or any plans to
revamp the Boxster's Achilles's?
