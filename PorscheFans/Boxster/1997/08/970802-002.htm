This probably refers to one of those well kept secret traction control
systems only available in Germany.  
Not only does the system apply the brakes for you when sensing inequitable
traction between wheels, it will actually activate the turning signal to
indicate which exit to take.
After bringing you to a complete stop safely on the side road the TC system
loads a tape in the cassette which promptly lectures you on proper driving
techniques.
It's all in German though.
Problem I had when experiencing this was the robot arm loading the tape
accidentally engaged clothing material of my driving companion and jammed the
mechanism.
That cost me quite a lot of DM when I got back to the rental office.

If you don't think that's funny enough;  the special TC system has a warning
light on the dash that indicates an animated foot pressing on the brakes.
When you really push the limits it shows two feet.

Just broke 7K on the odometer and still going strong.
One thing that never goes away is the great feeling I get when driving my
Boxster.
A terrific sense of the road and the autos' attitude while traversing it.
 Very nice, confident feeling.
