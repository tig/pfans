My only experience with TC was in Germany. We were going between 130-140
mph on the autobahn when it started to rain. Of course, I didn't slow
down.

It was mostly fine, but once in a while the TC would activate, applying
the brakes. Basically, the TC was saying, "Hey! You're a fool, and I'm
trying to save your life. Please slow down."

Fortunately for my wife and I, the unlimited speed section ended. What
I'm saying is that a) I'm a fool and b) I like TC/ABD.
