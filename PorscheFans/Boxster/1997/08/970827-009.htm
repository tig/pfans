When I first heard about this boomerang thingy I thought, "Hey, that
sounds like a pretty good idea!"  Then, in this forum, I read an
objection from someone which I believe is a valid one and for which I
have not heard a rebuttal: his point (sorry don't have the original note
anymore) is basically this:

Since this "heavy guage [sic] steel bar" will redirect the force of this
30mph collision into the frame instead of allowing the car to crumple as
it was designed to do, does saving my radiators cost me my alignment,
the integrity of my frame, the presets on my radio, or what?  The energy
has to go somewhere.  Perhaps you can tell me what kind of testing was
done in this respect (i.e. comparing damage done with and without this
obviously wonderful device bolted onto the nose)?  I would be interested
in seeing the results of this testing.

The engineer in me wonders that Porsche would allow a serious design
flaw (as you purport this to be) to escape the factory - don't they have
curbs in Germany (yes they do)!?!  I'd like an opinion of a certified
Porsche mechanic, or better yet someone from the Porsche design team.
Failing that I'll continue to be cynical, and keep my $250 deductible
which will protect where the boomerthingy won't.

Regards,

Take a light and peek in the front air dams.  Now pretend it's your head
instead of the radiators sitting there an inch above the front bumper.
 Imagine going 30 miles and hour and hitting an unexpected dip.   Would
you
rather have a thin sheet of plastic between you and the pavement or a
heavy
guage steel bar?

And I bet I'm not the only one with a $1,000 deductable. 

Check back in after you take your first hit...
