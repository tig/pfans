As has been noted previously, 911s often emit a puff of smoke on
startup, from a small puff to a big puff depending perhaps on how long
the car has been sitting.
This is usually attributed to oil leaking past the valve guides and seals
and settling in the bottom of the cylinders & consequently burns when
the engine is refired.  Since the cylinders are 'flat', the oil doesn't get a
chance to seep past the rings and dribble back into the sump like it would
on an upright or V engine.
This doesn't seem to cause any difficulty, other than perhaps some
embarrassment related to owning an expensive sports car that smokes
like a clapped-out Fiat, even momentarily.  This is irritating enough when
it's a 15-year old 911, but I can imagine  the consternation when it's a
brand new $50K Box!
I can't believe that this is necessarily a boxer-motor characteristic, as I've
had two V-dubs and a 914 with flat fours and none of them smoked on
startup.
