     Two things have happened to my car.  Have had it for about 
     17 weeks, and have 7200 miles on it.  I put the top up and 
     down several times a day, as long as it isn't raining (it 
     has hardly rained here in Boston this summer).  I also carry 
     my briefcase in the front trunk, so open that every day, at 
     least two times a day.
     
     Today, the cable for the front trunk release snapped.  I 
     don't have the car right now, but the fellow who does have 
     it says it is frayed at the break.  Has anyone else seen 
     anything like this?
     
     Also, there is a spot on the convertible top, near one of 
     the struts, which looks like it is rubbing on something.  It 
     is a small, circular area.  Any hints on this one?
     
     All else is wonderful.  BTW, if anyone does any autox in 
     their Boxster, I have found that when I remove the spare 
     tire to do the event, the bolt to hold the spare in rattles. 
     The sound gets amplified by the car body, and you would 
     think that something important is falling off.   The bolt 
     can be removed, but doing that often would result in fraying 
     of the carpeting in that area.  Instead, I have taken a 
     block of insulation foam (about 1.5" thick) and use that as 
     a spacer over the bolt, holding it on with the hardware 
     which held the tire in place.  Works very well in removing 
     the distraction.
     
     TIA for any response.
     
     
     Jon
