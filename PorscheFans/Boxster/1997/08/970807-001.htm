     BPFans;
     
       My Silver/black Boxster w/ hardtop, P38, and remote locking/antitheft 
       ordered in December arrived.  And like everyone else who actually has one
     
       reported, it does not disappoint.
     
     
               "The left cup holder fell apart the first time I used it.  It has 
       nothing to hold it together.  It also caused one of the vent louvers to 
       pop out of place (I popped it back in place).   The cup holder thing is 
       tres tacky."
       
       I have reassembled my cup holders after they pulled apart (get the right 
       and left assemblies correct), and then put a wrap of black electrical 
       tape on the front of the ring.  That way, it clears the rubber fingers, 
       and does a decent job of holding it all together.  3 months now, and no 
       further problems.
       
     
     
     
                Question:
     
       I heard from another Boxster owner I met at an autox that PCA (perhaps 
       zone 1) is only allowing Boxtsters to race if equipped with a 
       supplemental (higher) roll bar OR the hard top.  Can anyone confirm this?
     
       Here in the Northeast Region, several Boxsters have run with the factory 
       roll hoops.  At last weekend's event we even had a class - two boxsters.
