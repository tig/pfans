I also have ordered a Boomerang for my Boxster.  I think that $300 is a small
price to pay to insure that minor to severe damage is not done to the front
end of the car.

I have spoken with two or three people who have already installed the
Boomerang and all of felt that it has already been more than worth the price
they paid and has, in fact, even saved them money.  I have three friends who
have already scuffed the spointer on the Boxster on speed bumps and parking
barriers.  All wish they would have known about the Boomerang.

Looking forward to getting the Boomerang installed on the Boxster.
