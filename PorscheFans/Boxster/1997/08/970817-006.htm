During a business trip to LA I stopped by the CEC show room on Santa Monica
Blvd.  If anyone is interested in talking with someone who seems very
knowledgeable about Boxsters and the aftermarket market, talk to Barry at CEC.
He showed me the Tech Art interior pieces he had in stock, aluminum shifter,
leather steering wheel,  the colored gauge faces.  He also described the Porsche
Extreme exhaust system.  Seems like a nice piece.  He says that it has tested at
more horsepower and, maybe more importantly, more torque.

We also looked at the Antera wheels that are on the car inExcellence.  He said
that the Tech Art areo kit had changed slighly loosing the indent on the side
piece at the rear and the little horizontal line on the side in front of the
wheel.  To my eye, it looks better.

There were many other cars along with other bits and pieces that would make any
Porsche fan happy.   This is not a commercial, just a description of a very nice
shop.
