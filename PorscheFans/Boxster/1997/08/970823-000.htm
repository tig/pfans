         I participating in four autocrosses, this season, using my Saturn 
      SC2, while I waited for my '76 911S to come out of the paint shop 
      (which still hasn't happened), or my Boxster to arrive (which happened 
      2.5 weeks ago).  Now that I have a no-excuses vehicle, I have a family 
      event conflict that will keep me from participating in the only 
      remaining AutoX of the year for my region (NNJR) on Sept 13.
      
         Are there any AutoXs scheduled not-too-far from Northern N.J. in 
      September that anyone knows of, that would accept a member of another 
      region?

FCSCC in Waterbury, CT (1/2 hour from NJ border on I-84)
on 9/21. I will miss this event though. Jon Sirota ran his Boxster
in one of our events. The lot is small but courses are OK.
Check the FCSCC web site for more info (Search on altavista for it).
There should be a 993 and maybe an F355 there.

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S
