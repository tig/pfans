     My Boxster came with Pirelli PZeros (17").
     
     I have autocrossed mine 3 times.  I have only ever 
     autocrossed 3 times, so I personally am not qualified to 
     state how good the car is.  However, it is a blast, and it 
     handles beautifully.  I have been running BFG r1's on it for 
     autocross events.
     
     However, my Boxster has also had co-drivers in two of the 3 
     events, and both of them were MUCH more experienced than I 
     am. If you are an SCCA member, see August SportsCar, the 
     page about the National Tour event at Fort Devens.  That 
     Boxster is mine, driven by my son who is a National Champion 
     driver in SCCA CM class.  He says the car is very 
     competitive, it handles beautifully, and it goes "where you 
     point it". I know that it must be good because, except for 
     my first event, I am in the middle of the pack against other 
     drivers; if it were up to just the cars, I am sure it would 
     be near or at the top of the pack.  BTW, at the PCA event 
     (NER) also at Fort Devens, there were two Boxsters.  There 
     was reported to be some comments about the Boxster being 
     another 914 during the early runs, but, again, the 
     performance of the car (not necessarily the driver) might 
     have changed some of those previous impressions.
     
     There was an early report of an event in Atlanta, I believe, 
     where a Boxster was run, and did very poorly.  I understand 
     that the driver complained about a lack of stiffness at the 
     starting line, with windshield vibration, door vibration,e 
     tc.  In my experience, watching my son at his start, there 
     was some very minor change in the door-to-rear-fender 
     spacing (top down) at the start when the tires chattered on 
     the pavement, but it was very minor.  I have heard nothing 
     else negative.
     
     IMHO, it is a great car to drive on the street, on the back 
     roads, on the highway, and on the autocross course.  Enjoy!!

My silver/black Boxster came with Contental 17" tires on it, another friend 
had Michelins on his and another one I know has Dunlop. I think it was 
whatever is in the tire-rack next.  By the way....my car will be the Pace Car 
for the Sept. 6, 7 PCA Club Race in Las Vegas....Really had to twist my arm.
     
Has anyone driven their car in autocrosses or Slaloms....opinions please.
 Have driven mine three times now and the car handles great... Much better
than my 911 did.
