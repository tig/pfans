Well, I just wanted to say a big thanks to David Ferguson for replying to 
my first post to this mailing list just a couple of days after I got my 
Boxster. I was looking for a holder for my hardtop, and he suggested that 
I talk to Automotion because they were working with someone to make one, 
but they hadn't measured it out yet, so they needed a car with a hardtop 
to look at and check out.

Well, I'm happy to say that I am now the proud owner of a very spiffy 
hoist mechanism. It was built by Ideal Mfg. Co., a guy named Mark Ellis. 
He came out and installed it, and then Automotion sent a guy over to take 
some pictures of it. (So when the next catalogue comes out, that's MY car 
in the picture (and my ugly garage!)) And the best part is, it was free, 
Free, FREE!!! (Since I was helping them out. He said the normal retail 
would probably be around $150)

Anyway, it's a real nice hoist. The one I have is a manually operated 
pully system, but he said he would be making an electric one as well. 
Mark Ellis' number is (805)929-8101 if anyone is interested in getting 
one before Automotion starts carrying them.

So, I just wanted to acknowledge the mailing list for helping me out!!
Also, just today I broke the 1000 mile mark, so now I can really open 'er 
up!!!

Whoo-Hooo!!!
Chris
