911's.  Cost was an issue.  A Targa or Cab, new or used, 1996, 1997 or =

I also self insure up to 1K. Seems smart to me!

Any of you good folks have any thought that our Boxsters might, in the
long run, be considered in the same vein as the 914?  Not quite a
Porsche?

How about a choice...Would you buy the last of the 911's that are air
cooled, or the first of the water cooled?  What is, for pure driving
pleasure, the most desirable Porsche to own, and appreciate (apart from
the twin turbo)?

Someone else asked about fitting the boomerang on the boxster...Can
anyone tell us just how to accomplish this feat? ie: time tools and
cost.

After 10 days on vacation, I returned home and tried to get into my
boxster.  Pushed the key release repeatedly, nothing happened.  Same
thing for the rear deck lid.  Finally I gave up and entered the car
using the old fashioned way with the key in the door.  Immediately the
alarm (horn honking) began, but when i inserted the key in the ignition
all returned to normal. Also, couldn't get the rear deck, or front deck
open with the levers (yes, door open, key in ignition, and out).  Now
everything is back to normal.  Is this normal behavior?  Anyone had
similar experience?

Steve,

After either 7 or 10 days, the remote feature disables itself.  I think
starting the car puts everything back to normal.  Full documentation on
this feature can be found in the owners manual, but Porsche does
consider this normal behavior.

Cheers,  RC

My arctic silver with black interior arrived on Sunday at 7:00pm.  I
ordered it in March of this year and the wait was well worth it!  It's
been a love affair at first drive.

Is anyone using any kind of a steering wheel lock ie The Club etc?

As to the recent M3 comments, my wife's  everyday drive is a deluxe
edition (Wood & Leather) M3.  She loves it.  I enjoy driving it for what
it is ... a very fast luxury coupe.  It is not the same experience as my
Boxster.=20

My Boxster has less than 100 miles on it so far.  I'll report back after
it's past the break in period.

I know nothing about them, but there was a company in Excellence this
month in the back that advertised different colored gauge faces for
993 and Boxster for "$149-299".  They had a (black & white) picture of
the gauge faces for Boxster and 993.

***MESSAGE SENT TO AUTOWEEK***

Dear Autoweek

First of all, i dont understand how the Boxster can even be compared to =
the
Corvette.  Totally and utterly two different kind of cars.  Maybe its
because the Boxster has *NO* competition? =20

Anyways if I was to choose between the Boxster and the Corvette i would
choose the Boxster.  Mainly because its a Porsche.  And anyone who
understands Porsche cars will agree with me.  To understand this better,
take the Dodge Viper.  It has awesome power, low price, and tough =
menacing
looks.  But I'd rather own a Porsche 911 Carrera Targa or better...=20
Second, the Boxster is a true roadster (mid-engine, light weight,
convertible, 2 seater) whereas the Convertible Corvette is too large to =
be
a roadster.  Finally, the Boxster is a rare car.  I live in Toronto and
have yet to see one at all. =20

But the quote about the C5 feeling like a supercar?  That's B.S.  Sure =
the
Corvette will probably outperform the Boxster in terms of =
acceleration...
but the corvette is far from a supercar.  Have you driven the dodge =
viper?=20
That car leaves the C5 in its dust.  Have you driven the Porsche 911 =
Turbo
or Turbo S?  You cant even compare these cars to the C5 in terms of
anything.  Sure there is a bit of a price difference...but you guys can
compare two different cars with the only similarity being their price
(boxster vs. Corvette), so why cant you compare two similar cars with =
two
different prices?  In my opinion and most other reasonable people with
sports/performance car knowledge, a super car is something like the =
Mclaren
F1 roadcar, the Lamborghini Diablo, the Ferrari F50, the Porsche 911 GT1 =
or
911 Turbo S, or even the RUF CTR2, the former being a car with looks =
that
originated almost 40 years ago.  These are supercars.  They make the C5
look like the slow fat kid in public school with the big butt.  (Stupid
analogy but you get the point).=20

Just my opinion.

I bought my Boomerang from Ogner Porsche in Woodland Hills, CA.  My =

installed it on my new bumper in 20 minutes.  Although they didn't =

because of other work I had done, they said they would normally ask =
$45.00 to
put it on.  (after seeing it, they are going to start carrying it) =20

Since the steel bar is predrilled, installation was very simple - just a
matter placing the boomerang against the underside of the bumper, and
attaching it with stainelss steel screws.  I could have done it myself.  =
 And
you can't see it from above.

I dealt driectly with Jeff Korda (a Porsche mechanic with alot of =
experience)
- a very smart guy and very pleasant to talk to.  No pressure at all to
buy...

By the way, before I put this on I called the Porsche line to get their

of
front bumper damage and thought this was an excellent idea.

For those interested Ogner's number is 1 888 693-3772

Subject: Boomerang?  Shmoomerang!


When I first heard about this boomerang thingy I thought, "Hey, that
sounds like a pretty good idea!"  Then, in this forum, I read an
objection from someone which I believe is a valid one and for which I
have not heard a rebuttal: his point (sorry don't have the original note
anymore) is basically this:

Since this "heavy guage [sic] steel bar" will redirect the force of this
30mph collision into the frame instead of allowing the car to crumple as
it was designed to do, does saving my radiators cost me my alignment,
the integrity of my frame, the presets on my radio, or what?  The energy
has to go somewhere.  Perhaps you can tell me what kind of testing was
done in this respect (i.e. comparing damage done with and without this
obviously wonderful device bolted onto the nose)?  I would be interested
in seeing the results of this testing.

The engineer in me wonders that Porsche would allow a serious design
flaw (as you purport this to be) to escape the factory - don't they have
curbs in Germany (yes they do)!?!  I'd like an opinion of a certified
Porsche mechanic, or better yet someone from the Porsche design team.
Failing that I'll continue to be cynical, and keep my $250 deductible
which will protect where the boomerthingy won't.

Although I haven't seen the Boomerang or examined the front bumper with
the boomerang in mind, as I've heard it described the Boomerang attaches
to the plastic bumper, not the frame.  In that case the boomerang
spreads an impact force over the whole of its area onto the bumper.  =
This
would reduce the possibilty of the localized impact forces being strong
enough to deform the bumper.  If you need an example, get an empty two
liter soda bottle and jab it in the middle of its length with your index
finger.  Notice how it deforms.  Now take a strip of something rigid =
like
a metal ruler or a section of wood lath and place it flat along the
bottles length.  Jab the rigid piece and notice how it deforms less over =
a
greater area.  You're more likely to get a permanent crinkle without the
rigid bar.  For something more salient (or if you don't have a two liter
handy) I ask this question:  What hurts more, getting your toes stepped =
on
by 120 lbs in a stilleto heel or the same in a pair of tennis shoes?  =
Even
your 180 lb buddy stepping on your toes with his tennis shoes ought to
hurt less then that 120 lbs on a heel spike.

I hope this ends the "boomerang: how could it possibly work?" thread.

Alas I think it was me that first raised the kinetic energy issues.  I =
may
well be wrong on that count.

The boom-a-thingy I understand to be pre-drilled for mounting on the =
lower
edge of the nose.  Importantly this is not a structural part of the car =
and
so dispersing the impact across the length of the nose may well result =
in
less cosmetic damage in minor impacts.

Strangely we're not hearing from the Boomer-thingy people on this list

effective
in minor situations and result in less expensive damage in more =
significant
impacts.  Past that and despite Rick's attempts to assert his
kitchen-physics analogies <g> I am sure that the energy of the impact is
not dissipated by the Boomer-widget, it's just transferred over a larger =
area.
One could conjecture that where that energy is spent may well be further =
up
the nose at its mounts, resulting in unseen cracking of the mounts =
bject: Re: Boxster Shifter

It has a long throw and it has the 'spongey', elastic feel of any cable
shift -- in fact worse than some Honda front wheel drive cars.
Nevertheless, it has a quick (if long) action and it has a good
'selectivity' feel.  It is a disappointment and will not last long I'm =
sure.

Conventional gearboxes are obsolescent and may be a thing of the past =
soon
enough if the BMW sequential shifting six speed makes its way into the =
996
and later the Boxster.

For me, the Getrag six speed is the best feel of a conventional box (in
some vettes, some M3's and some Australian muscle cars) but needs double
syncro on first and second.  The MX5/Miata shifter (not the gearbox, =
just
the shift kit) is the most accurate, tactile box I've used.  The 911 box =
is
pure and enjoyable but sometimes feels like a metal stick in a bag of
marbles (sorry, that's harsh.)  I've not driven more than one old =
Ferrari,
a 308GTS, but it was sweet and I recently drove an early 90's Mondial =
and
that was pure, crisp, almost exhilarating -- more so than the rest of =
the
car, I'm afraid.

So, how say you on shifters and has anyone heard of a kit or any plans =
to
revamp the Boxster's Achilles's?

The Boxster Boomerang is not designed as a structural saftey device.  It =

The one on my '93 and '94 RX-7's wasn't too shabby either.

It's funny.  I used to have an '83 AMC Eagle wagon 4x4--quite possibly=20
the worst car ever designed by a human being.  When I had it, I was on=20
this kick that I had to have all the undercarriage protection I could=20
find: skid plates, lift kits, etc.

But then, I had this amazing revelation:  Why don't I just avoid these=20
obstacles that the undercarriage might hit?

Which brings me to my point.  I think the boomerang says something about =

the kinds of drivers buying this car.  Apparently, Porsche feels that=20
maybe this will be the first "real" sports car these drivers will be=20
owning, and as such, they won't really know how low it is (which =
actually=20
isn't as low as my last two RX-7's).  Why would this be the only car on=20
which Porsche chooses to make this glorified angle-iron available?  The=20
latest 911 Turbo S certainly has no more ground clearance available =
under=20
its chin--I dare say it has a fair amount less--and no such idiocy is=20
available to protect the unspeakably-pricey carbon fiber chin of that =
car.

Why don't all of you who are trying to justify this $300+ ripoff just=20
watch where you're going, or climb back into the Range Rover where curbs =

might be in the driving forecast?  In the 5000 or so miles I've logged=20
thus far, I still have nary a scatch on the body.  Sure, that'll =
probably=20
change at some point, but when it does, the earth will not stand still=20
while I mourn this most-odious moment.

When that moment does occur, it won't likely be because I slammed into a =

gas station island or concrete parking stop.  It'll probably be from =
some=20
runaway shopping cart.

Just my $.02, which ends up being more like $1.35.

Subject: speakers
To: boxster@porschefans.com

Can anyone tell me where the 8 speakers are located in the Hi Fi/8
speaker option.  I believe there are two each on top of the right & left
dash, one each on each door, but for the life of me I can't find the
other two!  Also, when I toggle the fader to the rear, I hear nothing in
the rear!! Am I missing two speakers?

Thanks to anyone who can solve my newest trivia question!

Subject: "Not a Porsche?"  (Steve 8/27)

< Boxster "not quite a Porsche?" and "in the same vein as the 914">
The Boxster is all Porsche. Four years ago it came from a clean sheet of
paper, Porsche did it all.  Unlike the 914 the the 986 will evolve in
Porsche's line for many years.

<whats the most desirable Porsche to own for pure driving pleasure &
appreciation>
Well Steve thats a pretty subjective question,  whats YOUR pleasure, or
for that matter, whats your driving? -- curvy country rds, PCA track
events, weekend fun, distance touring? All 3 of my cars are distinctly
different, not really better or worse. No doubt about it, the Boxster is
an all-around fun drive.
Don't think that 'appreciation'(or depreciation) should really be in the
criteria here (these are great fun cars, not stock investments). For me,
if it isn't a real kick to drive (and to look at) no amount of good
return on investment will keep it in my garage.

Regarding your question on getting an air-cooled 993 before the 996s
come out?  The 996 will probably be a great car. We'll probably sit in
it & forget what came before. But right now I think the 993 is a super
automobile and it's pretty hard to imagine anything sounding better than
that air-cooled 3.6 boxer.  It is the highest evolution of the
first/best 35 years of the air-cooled 911 and that s/b worth something.
