Not quite 'ambivalent' really; whereas the author made little or no
contradictory statements (as in good things) about the car (least ways, as
quoted therein).

Don't think I'd look to "GQ" for much in the way of authoritative reviews on
cars anyway.

Figure this; the author was paid (if he was) about $600.00 for his review
(depending upon word count).  He'll probably go on; eking out this meager
existence (selling whorish like to anyone that'll publish his tomes), until
-hope upon hope- he finishes the grande novel and gets to pose for the pipe
and ascot picture.

I found his tripe to be especially pedantic, to the point of diversion.  If
you can't say it well in a succinct manner, then dazzle them with
obfuscation!.

Having driven on the motor ways in England I can personally attest to there
being only a handful that have attained the skills required for safe, high
performance driving.  Most of these drivers are on the F1 circuit.  
I dare say slewing along at a whopping 60 kph tops in their miserable traffic
snarl is not worthy of the Boxster.
I'll wager his big problem with seating position and comfort was the fact it
was an LHD car and not the wrong way round.  He never could get situated
properly.

As for glare from the dash (and NOT the windscreen as he writes), here in
Florida, where the sun shines all de day long- there is minimal glare!  Or,
maybe, his "L" license plate was inadvertently left on the dash... that's a
possibility!
Rear view is accommodated by looking into the properly adjusted mirrors
strategically placed around the car, not swiveling in your seat to look over
the shoulder.  I have yet to, in my euphoria, cross lanes into another
vehicle.

What merit does one place on the work of a hack journalist of minor report
writing for a clothing magazine in decline?  Just because it's been printed
does not necessarily make it so.
It's like talking to a Piper Cub pilot with ten hours time telling stories
about the Space Shuttle.
Does not compute.
