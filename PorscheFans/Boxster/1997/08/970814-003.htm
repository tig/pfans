Subject:  Re:  Houston Delivery

FYI:
I recently moved from CA to TX, and figured it best to place my deposit 
in TX.....

When I sent my check to Don McGill Imports in Houston in May of this 
year, I was told "January or February" delivery.  Well, after arriving 
in Texas this summer, I gave a call to see what the status was, and 
since then I've gotten the general impression that:
a. 	They don't seem concerned in the least about my 50 grand.  I should 
have started worrying when my phone calls were not returned after the 
salesman said: "I'll check where you are on the allocation and  get 
back to you".  In fact, I'm calling today to find out why a options 
sheet that was supposed to faxed last week still hasn't shown up.
b. 	It still is quite uncertain even now when I can ever expect 
delivery.  The latest I was told was I was in the next five to place my 
order.   Given the previous conversations, I don't even know it that is 
correct.

Perhaps I've just fallen through the cracks at an otherwise good 
dealership, but so far my general impression is not very favorable. 
 Any advice from the list?
