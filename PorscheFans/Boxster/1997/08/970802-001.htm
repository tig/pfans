Subj:	Boxster Delivered Yesterday

Hi to all,

This is a "repost" of one that did not get through to the board 
yesterday.

Have been waiting and reading this and other "Porsche Postings" for a 
long, long tiime and took delivery in N. VA yesterday.

The euphoria is so great that clear thinking and evaluation is nearly 
impossible for me, but I will say the following and post in more 
detail after many more miles:

I ordered and bought the 986 because it looked beautiful, reminded me 
of my fun times driving (1973 914-2 for 10 years and 1983 944 for the 
next ten years) and have missed owning such a car for the past four 
years.  My test drives at the dealer (brief and mostly on the 
straightaway) confirmed the power and ergonomics that the reviewers 
wrote about.  All of that was the major motivation.

Having owned the vehicle for less than 24 hrs., and having driven it 
(fairly hard, but within the dealer's "not over 5,000 rpms, not over 
100 mph" parameters), I can say without reservation that the joy of 
owning the car is in the driving.  Absolutely impeccable handling and 
shifts with ample power (for me, for now at least) in the corners and 
braking not to be believed.  Ride was plenty stiff  (for me, for now 
at least) and the pleasant things - top operation, radio, locks, etc.,
 etc., etc. - all are a pleasure (for me, for now at least).

As I cautioned, "euphoria".  When it settles a bit, back to you then.


Best regards to all waiting, lurking and owners!

Rich in VA

986, Silver/Black, Hardtop, Sport and a bit more.
