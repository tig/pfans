This Archive raises lots of interesting rumors.  Perhaps I missed the
resolution of this one, but what ever happened to the 245 hp engine in the
wings discussion.  Will it exist?  As an option?  As the standard engine?  

A friend of mine has a M3 on order and has been taunting me about its
superior 0-60 time and better handling.  He drove a Boxster this weekend and
is now considering junking the M3 and getting 1.  Plymouth neon for those few
days when he needs a 4 door car and 2.  you know what.  

I placed my order at the Delaware dealership during June.  I was advised
yesterday to expect a car in December or January.  Its time to select
options.
