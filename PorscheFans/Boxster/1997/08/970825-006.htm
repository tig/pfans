Actually, current hot rumor is that BWM is going to release a soft-top
version of the M3 for the US market next year.  It should be quite a
ride. I'd be interested in hearing the definition of a sports car.
Acceleration, braking  and handling would seem to be key factors to
consider, the fact that it might seat more than two or be practical
should not automatically exclude a vehicle from consideration.  

Let's face it, either a chip or an engine upgrade is necessary to put
the boxster comfortably in the company to which it aspires.  The styling
is great, but for the kind of driving that most of us do in the US it
needs more energy.  So while I sit at the top of my dealer's list for
the "S" version, I look ever more closely at the spy photos of the 996
cab published in last weeks AUTOWEEK.  With just a hair under 300 BHP,
and less weight than the 993, it will have the kind of acceleration that
the boxster should have.  And with delivery certain in the 3rd qtr of
'98, (vs the still unknown dates of the "S"), a move to the 996 cab
might be in the cards.

Cheers, 
RC
