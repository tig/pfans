***MESSAGE SENT TO AUTOWEEK***

Dear Autoweek

First of all, i dont understand how the Boxster can even be compared to the
Corvette.  Totally and utterly two different kind of cars.  Maybe its
because the Boxster has *NO* competition?  

Anyways if I was to choose between the Boxster and the Corvette i would
choose the Boxster.  Mainly because its a Porsche.  And anyone who
understands Porsche cars will agree with me.  To understand this better,
take the Dodge Viper.  It has awesome power, low price, and tough menacing
looks.  But I'd rather own a Porsche 911 Carrera Targa or better... 
Second, the Boxster is a true roadster (mid-engine, light weight,
convertible, 2 seater) whereas the Convertible Corvette is too large to be
a roadster.  Finally, the Boxster is a rare car.  I live in Toronto and
have yet to see one at all.  

But the quote about the C5 feeling like a supercar?  That's B.S.  Sure the
Corvette will probably outperform the Boxster in terms of acceleration...
but the corvette is far from a supercar.  Have you driven the dodge viper? 
That car leaves the C5 in its dust.  Have you driven the Porsche 911 Turbo
or Turbo S?  You cant even compare these cars to the C5 in terms of
anything.  Sure there is a bit of a price difference...but you guys can
compare two different cars with the only similarity being their price
(boxster vs. Corvette), so why cant you compare two similar cars with two
different prices?  In my opinion and most other reasonable people with
sports/performance car knowledge, a super car is something like the Mclaren
F1 roadcar, the Lamborghini Diablo, the Ferrari F50, the Porsche 911 GT1 or
911 Turbo S, or even the RUF CTR2, the former being a car with looks that
originated almost 40 years ago.  These are supercars.  They make the C5
look like the slow fat kid in public school with the big butt.  (Stupid
analogy but you get the point). 

Just my opinion.
