Just returned from a trip North to the Adirondacks and elsewhere.
Eight days, 3,400 miles.
The last 1,200 miles in just shy of 17 hours straight thru.  (no, not a
record, but a factor in my 'report' to follow.)

The 'zoom swerves' are a real problem.  You learn to calculate velocities and
convergent vectors quickly from glimpses in the mirrors or on peripheral
view.  A new topic for defensive driving schools.
No matter where - the car turns heads (and all kids yell, "Hey, cool car!")
 Ch. 19 was abuzz with trucker chatter when I passed, "Check out that
whatchamacallit four wheeler... what the hell kinda car zat?"

From Syracuse to Orlando (return leg), three and three quarters tanks.
 Slightly better than an hour driving, on average, per quarter tank (the
pilot in me).  I didn't keep track of the MPG, sorry.  I guess I could
reverse calculate, if it mattered.

Remember that guy in England who complained about not getting comfortable
during a two hour trip in a Boxster?
Two adults, over three thousand miles, the Boxster IS quite comfortable and
functional.  Maybe he was 20 stones plus??  
Although I was fatigued on the marathon last leg, I was never physically
uncomfortable.  Lumbar support (adjustable) would be nice.

The car is flogged, cosmetically.  I struck a road alligator (truck retread
lying in the road).  A protective bar stuck on the front would not have
protected from the resultant damage, maybe even would have caused more than
just replacement of the bumper cover.  When there is no where to go, the dang
thing looming large in your lane, and you're at speed- WHacK!  It happens.  

Probably not the best idea to take that trip, if I wanted to keep it nice and
pretty.  But that isn't what the car is about, otherwise they'd sell you a
little mounting platform and ferget about a functional engine.
It's just such a BLAST to drive.  FUN is the operative word.

Tons of room for storage, more than enough for the two of us for an extended
week long road trip.
As a matter of fact;  while putting away a few things [my SO at one end, me
at the other end] interested bystanders gathered around looking inside.  Of
course, "Where's the engine?" was heard too.

Did have a problem though;  it was there before the trip, became more
pronounced during it.
The dang thing wouldn't start.  It's intermittent, and hard to repeat what
makes it happen.
Ten to twelve attempts, sit and wait, then one last try and it starts.
Car sits at the shop now, getting poked and probed.  
We thought it was the key head being bad, or a dead battery, nope.  
Did have a fault with the interior sensor, but that would kill the ignition
altogether.
It has been my understanding the car will NOT even turn over if the security
system is compromised.  Yet my car will crank- but not fire.  First crank it
has some combustion, but no flow of fuel (it seems to me).
A real head scratcher it is...  more later, when we get it figured out.

One thing I noticed last night about three a.m. was the subtle lines inside
the car.  How everything fits.  Lines follow a logical order, no unexplained
or unfinished parts.   It all works well, very pleasing to the eye.
Even the contour of the roof pillars as they turn inward from the windshield,
is well proportioned and thoughtful.
Great piece of art.
