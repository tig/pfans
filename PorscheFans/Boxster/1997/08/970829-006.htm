FWIW

There were 5 in attendance (Black/Beige, 2 Blues and 2 Red/Black), although there was a Black/Black in the 
hotel parkade I was at, but it left the first day of WW!

One was Concour'd, and 3 did the AutoX.

The Boxsters competed in class "S5" against the likes of the 930, 968, 944S2, and 951. 

The Boxsters finished(from memory):
First in Class, First in Stock (nine year autocrosser, 51.988-ish)
Second in Class, Second in Stock (Me! 52.833 sec, .003 sec ahead of a 968)
Sixth-ish in Class (novice in something like a 55)

FTD went to a P5 944S2 in 49.1 (from memory, remember), and another 944S2 of a fellow P-Fan, was second 
in P5, and I seem to remember second overall!

Caveat! To be fair in recounting this, the stock cars had the dry runs, the Production cars got dry, rain, and 
drizzle, and the GT and Mod. cars basically got rain!

97 986/M030 Guards Red, and darned proud of it!
