It's funny.  I used to have an '83 AMC Eagle wagon 4x4--quite possibly 
the worst car ever designed by a human being.  When I had it, I was on 
this kick that I had to have all the undercarriage protection I could 
find: skid plates, lift kits, etc.

But then, I had this amazing revelation:  Why don't I just avoid these 
obstacles that the undercarriage might hit?

Which brings me to my point.  I think the boomerang says something about 
the kinds of drivers buying this car.  Apparently, Porsche feels that 
maybe this will be the first "real" sports car these drivers will be 
owning, and as such, they won't really know how low it is (which actually 
isn't as low as my last two RX-7's).  Why would this be the only car on 
which Porsche chooses to make this glorified angle-iron available?  The 
latest 911 Turbo S certainly has no more ground clearance available under 
its chin--I dare say it has a fair amount less--and no such idiocy is 
available to protect the unspeakably-pricey carbon fiber chin of that car.

Why don't all of you who are trying to justify this $300+ ripoff just 
watch where you're going, or climb back into the Range Rover where curbs 
might be in the driving forecast?  In the 5000 or so miles I've logged 
thus far, I still have nary a scatch on the body.  Sure, that'll probably 
change at some point, but when it does, the earth will not stand still 
while I mourn this most-odious moment.

When that moment does occur, it won't likely be because I slammed into a 
gas station island or concrete parking stop.  It'll probably be from some 
runaway shopping cart.

Just my $.02, which ends up being more like $1.35.
