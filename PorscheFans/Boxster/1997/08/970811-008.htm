     I am new to this distribution list, but I have gone through the 
     archives and still have not seen anything to confirm or deny the 
     rumors of a Turbo Boxster. I believe Andrew Potts' webpage confirmed 
     the turbo rumor but that it the only place I have seen it mentioned. 
     Does anyone have any other information? My dealer said it would never 
     happen, although he did confirm a 2.8 liter to be introduced in late 
     98. 
     
     Like many of the stories I have read, I too thought my dealer was 
     taking advantage of me. I put my order in the Feb.97 (right after the 
     Chicago Auto show) and the dealer said the car would arrive in the 
     May/June timeframe. Well I took delivery of my Silver/Red Boxster on 
     July 3rd. The car actually was available on June 30th but due to 
     business concerns I couldn't pick it up. I guess the dealer was honest 
     after all.
     
     I love this car even though I too have experienced the roof problem. 
     It is almost at the 1000 mile mark so I guess I will have the dealer 
     look at it when I have the oil changed. 
     
     Henry...
