    Jim:

    One of us is misunderstanding the other's use of the word
    "optomistic"... I wouldn't use the word to describe Porsche's
    published numbers, which UNDERrate the Boxster's performance.

    -Andy

    P.S.  Not that it matters, but 6.1 and 6.0 seconds aren't really
          all that close... A 0.1-second difference in elapsed time
          translates to about 8.8 feet of distance at 60 MPH, which
          means that from a standing start, Motor Trend's car would
          be almost a car-length ahead of Car & Driver's at the
          hundred-yard mark.
