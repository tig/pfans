Much as I perceive some value in the oddly named Boomerang, I'm seeing a
questionable recurrence of (apparently) unbiased advocacy of this thing.

Marketing types call it FUD -- it's the same fear, uncertainty and doubt
used to persuade people to buy insurance they don't need to 'protect' them
from a risk they may or may not face.  "If you don't bolt this thing to the
underside of your car, you'll end up with expensive repair bills when you
hit a steep driveway or drive over something at speed."  Good grief.

Porsche made a light, flexible, non-structural part of the car subject to
damage in the event that the car unavoidably meets with harm.

I'm concerned that the Boomerang directs forces into the structure of the
car in a manner that was not part of the design of the car.  Surely it's
preferable to completely destroy something cosmetic (the bumper) than to
have any 'hard' part of the car hit any 'hard' obstacle.
