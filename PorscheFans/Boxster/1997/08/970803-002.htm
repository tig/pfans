Just picked mine up on Friday. This is the first time I've been out of
it other than to sleep and eat. This car is *amazing*. Got the sport
package, CD w/sound package, heated seats, aluminum dials, wind
deflector and on-board computer. Zenith blue w/grey interior. The
color is fantastic - everyone comments on how much the love it.

I can't get over the reaction it gets when I drive it around. My
girlfriend was laughing everytime someone passed us because of the
faces they were making.

Had a great dealer experience at Ira Porsche in Danvers, MA. No extra
charges at all, just car, options, lux tax, sales tax, title &
registration and documentation. Came in a day earlier than promised at
time of order placement even (5 month wait though).

My favorite "delighters" are the radio volume tracking the RPM's and
the power windows operating for a while after removing the key from
the ignition.

Wish there were a way to turn off the climate control with one button
press though - having to hold the "-" button for the fan for a while
to shut it off is a bit annoying.

My forehead is bright red from the scorching it got these past 2 days
as we drove around non-stop. The handling is unbelievable.
