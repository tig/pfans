I wrote sometime back about a problem with my speedo.  Any help here will be
appreciated.  Seems that the speed is registering 10% fast; ie 55 at 50, 77 at
70 and so on.  Checked it out since the local police have set up little radar
trailers to let everyone know how fast they are going.  On a recent trip, the
odometer read 1/10 + of a mile more for each mile driven so by the time 10 miles
went by, I had 11 or so  miles showing on the odo.  The dealership had a similar
complaint and Porsche told them that their target is to be within 10%.  Seems to
me to out of the bounds of accuracy.  This would mean that my car which
currently shows 5500 miles actually has only 5000.

Comments?  

My new engine goes in this week.
