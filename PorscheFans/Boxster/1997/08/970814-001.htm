As you have seen no doubt, my Boxster is up for sale.  Found a silver
one in MN, right next to my home (in St. Paul). I've had a couple of
inquires, but no firm offers.  I won't be disappointed if it doesn't
sell.  I personally love the color, and it is my wife who prefers the
silver over the Arena Red. I do love the silver too, but what a hassle
to buy another one and have it shipped down here to SC.  I'll let you
know how it goes.

Drove the car to the dealer yesterday, and finally did the checklist
thing, and took "official" delivery. Took the hardtop off and put up the
soft top. Forgot to try out the six changer CD player and cassette deck.
Everything was spot-on, no scratches, or non-working bits. The soft top
had never been up before, so it didn't meet the closures in the front. 
I was advised to pull it home, and let it sit a few days to stretch it
out. Normal? I ordered the hardtop rack. It is really nice in graphite,
and very light and portable.  Wanted to get the washer stuff, and
preservative, so when I do wash the car it will be done with treated
water.  Is the stuff any good?  An aside is that the dealer here give
you a little decal, good for one free (by hand), car wash every
Saturday, for life! Hated to drive the car to the dealer, now I have 80
miles on the car.  Isn't that a bit high for a guy selling a new one?
(ha ha!)

Posting this also to porschfans to see what kind of a reaction I get...
All the best to you Jim, and to the other Boxster friends.
