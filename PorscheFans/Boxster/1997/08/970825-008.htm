No longer so much a rumour.  It's public at least for the Euro driver.  I
agree with a sense of distain for the US spec M3 for lack of horsepower and
asequential shifting box.  It's also anonymous in a sea of 3 series
shopping carts.  In Australian spec, the M3 is true supercar performance
and handling.  In US spec, well, at least you've got the handling -- now
just try to find where you parked it amid all those 316's and 318s...

There are now released shots of the coupe.
