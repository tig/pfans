Although I haven't seen the Boomerang or examined the front bumper with
the boomerang in mind, as I've heard it described the Boomerang attaches
to the plastic bumper, not the frame.  In that case the boomerang
spreads an impact force over the whole of its area onto the bumper.  This
would reduce the possibilty of the localized impact forces being strong
enough to deform the bumper.  If you need an example, get an empty two
liter soda bottle and jab it in the middle of its length with your index
finger.  Notice how it deforms.  Now take a strip of something rigid like
a metal ruler or a section of wood lath and place it flat along the
bottles length.  Jab the rigid piece and notice how it deforms less over a
greater area.  You're more likely to get a permanent crinkle without the
rigid bar.  For something more salient (or if you don't have a two liter
handy) I ask this question:  What hurts more, getting your toes stepped on
by 120 lbs in a stilleto heel or the same in a pair of tennis shoes?  Even
your 180 lb buddy stepping on your toes with his tennis shoes ought to
hurt less then that 120 lbs on a heel spike.

I hope this ends the "boomerang: how could it possibly work?" thread.
