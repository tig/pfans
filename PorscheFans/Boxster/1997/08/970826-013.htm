DEAR TOM,

AS I PROMISED, I AM E-MAILING YOU SO YOU CAN E-MAIL ME BACK THE PAGE ON
WHICH PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO BUY BOXSTERS, AS WELL AS YOU INFORMING THEM
OF MY AVAILABILITY TO HELP THEM.  AS I INDICATED TO YOU, THERE IS AN
EXCELLENT CHANCE OF A TIPTRONIC ORDER BECOMING OPEN, AND I WOULD BE
GRATEFUL IF THIS WOULD HELP SOMEONE.  AS I ALSO TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE,
AN ORDER FROM THE FACTORY SHOULD BE BUILT IN DEC '97 - JAN. '98 FOR
JAN-FEB '98 DELIVERY.  PLEASE TRY TO GET YOUR ORDER IN BEFORE THE
BEGINNING OF THE MONTH, AS I AM TOLD THAT THAT WILL DELAY PRODUCTION FOR
ANOTHER MONTH IF WE CAN NOT ENTER THE ORDER UNTIL SEPTEMBER.

AGAIN, THANKS, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH YOU SOON.  MY HOURS
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK ARE: TUES - OFF DAY/ WED - 8:30AM-9PM 
                              THU - 12-9PM/ FRI 8:30AM-6PM/ SAT
8:30A-5PM

CALVIN JURMAN
