I'm not on the Boxster list, but my father forwarded me this message.

I've driven the M3 extensively on the street and in autocrosses, and I've
also driven the Boxster in both circumstances.  I have somewhat more
experience in the M3, but the Boxster weekend was far more than a casual
afternoon test drive (I drove it at an SCCA Solo II National Tour).

There's no doubt in my mind that the M3 has a superior engine, superior
brakes, at least equal handling, and far, far more practicality.  It's way
more than a "big old sedan with a monster engine."  For one thing, it's
not very big :-)

However, obviously, they aren't the same car.  The Boxster weighs a few hundred
pounds less than the M3, so in certain circumstances it'll be the better
handler.  Also, the top goes down, and so for a street car without multiple
passengers, there's really no comparison.

Me?  I'm waiting for the M3 Convertible.  Best of both worlds, at least for
a street car.  Rumored availability in the spring, ballpark $50K.
