The new  Car&Driver has a less than favorable review of the Boxster in their
handling comparison of a group of > $30K cars.

(I was out of town last week, so pls forgive me if this issue has been
covered.)

They gave it last place, in fact. The other cars were the Supra, Corvette, NSX,
911, BMW M3 [their favorite] and Viper. (Maybe there were more but that's all I
remember now.)

What is the feeling of the readership on this review??

note: i assume that their test car had the plain suspension. I didn't read
carefully enough to see if it had the plain wheels/tires.

note2: David Coleman in the new Excellence raved with love about the boxster
and said that he ordered one. he drove it extensively on the track and road.

FRED PACK

'73 9142.0L (track)
'98 Boxster (on order)
'89 944S2 (recently departed to a new owner to make room for the boxster)
