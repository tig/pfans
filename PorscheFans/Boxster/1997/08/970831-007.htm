Last April, the New York Times article on the Musuem of Modern Art's addition
of a Jag E-type was an absolute embarassment.  Herbert Muschamp was unable to
differentiate between his own sexual hangups and the spirit, performance, and
experience of the E-type.  After reading that article I was outraged as, I
expect, was every other current or past E-type owner!  To be fair, the Jag
article was a "Design Review" feature, not an "Automobile" feature.  
Recently, the Times did an article on the the passion and pleasure of driving
a Morgan.  Two thumbs up to the Times.  Time to forgive and forget.
Today (Sunday Aug 31), the Times Automobile section featured "What's the
Fairest Roadster of Them All?".  Three contributing  writers drove the
Boxster, SLK 230, Miata M, and BMW Z3 2.8.  Two of the three choose Boxster
first.  The third, admitting heresy, placed the Boxster last and the Miata
first.   Not to dwell on the contrarian's subjective appraisal,  but he
acknowledged that the Boxster is built to get around corners fast and praised
its remarkable handling.  But he felt it was too slow (compared to a Miata?)
at the start and disliked the ultra-modern styling".  Go figure. I can only
surmise that Peter Passell wasn't up to the task!
The two other contributing writers choose the Boxster first: James Cobb
wrote: "The first commandment of a roadster: Thou shalt have fun.  Measure
its grin factor.  Turn the key and count the smiles.  Diving the Boxster is
such an exhilarating joy thay you forget the price.  Its manners are
impeccable at any speed.  Like all Porsches, it makes demands of the driver.
 The body refuses to shake or shimmy.  Steering is so responsive that it
seems telekinetic."
Michelle Krebs gave the nod to the Boxster, over the SLK, because it is a
true sports car.  It is more about precision, control, and fun.  It captures
the romance of the open, winding road.  It scores for its superb poise and
overall balance of power and handling.  It is Porsche, purely and simply.
Enough said.
Hope this helps those who have written asking for reasons to place an order!
