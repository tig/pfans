Suckers are born every minute. Who would throw away 300 bucks protecting a
bumper?!

I've got a four month old boxster and use it.  Sure the front end has been
hammered a couple of times because of its low profile but big deal if it's
not pretty.  Besides a gash or ding that low doesn't really show.    How many
times are you going to be looking at the front bumper any way?   I didn't buy
the thing to be showroom new in three years.  I bought it to drive it.
  That's what this car is made for.  For those garage queens, throw away your
diapers and car covers.   Wear and tear on a Boxster says your doing it
right.  

And if you pop something hard enough to cause real damage - hey, that's what
insurance is for.
