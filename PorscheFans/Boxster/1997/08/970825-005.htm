I know what you mean about being skeptical.  Me too.  But if you'd seen how
easy the bumper dents in and how little protection it gives, you'd think
twice.  Remember, just inches behind this flimsy piece of palstic are some
real important items...

After my accident, the bumper ended up less than an eight of an inch from my
right radiator.  Thinking that it's better to have nothing but a light piece
of "non-structural" plastic between a road hazzard and a vital componant
doesn't make sense to me or the body shop who put the boomerang on.  The
steel bar gives a great deal of strength to the front end, and believe me, it
needs it.  If I had the boomerang on before, I would have saved myself almost
a $1,000 in repairs and a real bad headach...

As to you "fear" theory - I didn't  put this on on because I was afraid of
what might happen, I bought it because of what did happen.  (And I'm not the
only one.  I've read of at least a dozen people who've mess up their bumpers
too).  

No offense, but I don't care whether or not you put the boomerang on.   I was
just sharing a bad experience and a good solution.

Just watch the pot holes, curb bumpers, driveways, and road junk...
