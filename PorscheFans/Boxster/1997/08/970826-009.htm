Well said, but I would also like to add that the overall driving experience 
is much more than just power (important) and handling (more important). 
 It's also the feel and balance of the car on those lonely twisty roads, the 
wonderful whine of that awesome flat six behind your head, and the long 
heritage of Porsche.  To each his own, but with all that said, I would never 
buy a Chevy, or a 4 passenger coupe/sedan when for the same price I could 
own a Boxster.

Hi All,

I'm sorry, but I felt compelled to get in on this M3 vs. Boxster non-sense.
First of all, one of the major reasons I bought a Boxster was because of
the way it looks.

Yes, it's a Porsche, yes, it drives fast, and yes, the handling is great.
But I got it because it's a beautiful car. Point in fact, how many M3
owners get stopped on the street by strangers and asked about their cars?
How many Corvette owners turn heads every time they pull up to a red light?
I'll tell you, none. Because all BMW's look the same, and all Corvettes
look the same, and once you've seen one, then you've seen them all.

Here's an excellent example, one of my coworkers recently bought an M3.
It's a nice looking car, but it looks just like any of the other 15 BMW's
sitting in the parking lot. When I drove my car to work last week for the
first time, the entire building came out to check it out. I was out there
for 2 hours (I kid you not) demonstrating the car to everyone and letting
people sit in it (they begged). I must have put the top up and down about
15 times because people really liked it. Of course, while all of this was
going on, do you know how many people where gathered around the M3? I'll
tell you...None.

So when you read all these articles about the M3 having a stronger engine
and better handling, ask yourself this, which one looks better (of course
beauty is always in the eye of the beholder)? When you read that the
Corvette (with it's 5.7 liter V8), is a more powerful car (surprise,
surprise), ask yourself what would you rather own, a Porsche, or a
Chevrolet (the same people that gave you the convertible Geo Metro)?

I guess what I'm trying to say is, buying a car is as much personal taste
as anything. It sounds to me that all these Vette and M3 owners are bitter
about their cars and want to convince themselves, by arguing with us, that
they have a better car.

So to these people I say, fine, your car handles better, and goes faster.
But don't forget, this one's a Porsche and looks a lot better.

I certainly don't mean to insult anybody's personal taste or offend any BMW
or Vette owners, but I just think that all this arguing is ridiculous. If
you like power and handling, don't get a Boxster, if you'd like to own a
rare (for now) and beautiful car, then put your name on a list and wait for
9 months to get yours.

Happy driving to all...
