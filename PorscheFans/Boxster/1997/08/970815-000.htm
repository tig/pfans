The boxster can be locked so that the doors *can* open from the inside, or so
that they *cannot* be opened from the inside.  If you lock your car so the doors
cannot be opened from the inside, then the trunks cannot be opened (even if the
top is down) using the levers next to the driver's seat because these only work
when the driver's door is open.

How do you lock the car doors so they *don't* open from the inside? Just lock
the car with the key once or press the key button on the key once if you have
the remote locking feature.

If you want to be able to open the car doors from the inside (if you're leaving
someone in the car, for instance) then you turn the key *twice* or press the
button on the key *twice*.  If you use the remote key feature I think the horn
beeps once to let you know the car is locked but "unsecure" (I'm not sure about
the horn beep, I'll go out and try it, though).

Hope this helps-
Saludos,
Carlos
