In response to Johnny Yiu's two posts of 9 Aug:

My '98 price list from my dealer here in Germany (for US military)
indicates that the "Trend Package" (P79) has "2 metallic pains, interior
parts in color of car, partial leather seats" -- I, too, am not certain
what that means.  The "Sport Design Package" (P69) lists "Int. Black,
alum. Optic, Sport seats, 3 spoke steering wheel (only with Tiptronic
S)".  This is verbatim off the dealer's price list.  Anybody else have a
better idea?

It's interesting what you were told about the new lumbar support options
and the power seats.  My dealer told me that the power seats do NOT have
lumbar support or heating -- they cost an extra US $1520 for just power
front-back and height adjustments and driver's side memory.  He agrees
it certainly doesn't seem worth the money for these simple functions, so
he seems like a straight shooter who's not trying at all to get me to
fork out extra cash.  If you want lumbar support here in the US, it's
gonna be US $375 for each seat -- I'm not sure if it's a manual or power
adjustment.

Not sure if the prices you were quoted are in US $, but since they're
different than mine, maybe the options you have access to in Hong Kong
really are different than those we're being offered in the US.
