Placed a deposit of $3000 on a 98 Boxster with Negherbon Porsche in Oakland CA  2 months ago. According to the dealer, 12/97 allocation
i.e. 1/98 delivery. Price stated was MSRP plus destination fee and applicable taxes.

When I went by the dealership last week to pick up the new options and  price list it stated that the base price hadn't been increased compared to 97, but most options had increased in price by about 2.5%. The salesman told me at that time that I would have to specify options within the next several weeks.

I was quite suprised when I recieved a message from the salesperson yesterday stating that "Porsche" had decided to increase the base price by $1000 and that I should let him know what I wanted to do. He said he was sorry to have to tell me this, but that it was "Porsche's decision".

I was even more suprised when I didn't  find any discussion of this at PorscheFans last night.

It seems unlikely that Porsche would do this so soon after releasing their long awaited, presumably heavily pondered decision about 98 prices.

Any experiences, opinions, advice?
