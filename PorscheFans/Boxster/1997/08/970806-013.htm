     BPFans;
     
       My Silver/black Boxster w/ hardtop, P38, and remote locking/antitheft 
       ordered in December arrived.  And like everyone else who actually has one 
       reported, it does not disappoint.
            
       The ride w/P38 is not unduly harsh.  Even on a very bumpy road (aptly 
       called Hardsrabble), the ride is what I would call busy, but not 
       uncomfortable or harsh (even my wife did not object to the bumpiness, 
       just to my speed in the twisties).  Sometimes cornering speed seems 
       rather undramatic and unimpressive until I looked down at the speedo 
       (especially in low speed squeeling turns).  There were many 
       times when I was shocked to see how fast I was going, I must check the 
       speedo calibration.  In high-speed sweepers, (no squeal) it seems to 
       be riding on rails with a CG two feet below the pavement (its that 
       famous Porsche feel that you can only get with a flat HO engine 
       mounted at the bottom of the body.  It felt like I could have taken the   
       turn at any speed, and it would have just held and tracked.  Its an       
       incredible physical sensation.  Turn in and loading seem to be almost 
       instantaneous, can't wait to get it on the track.  
       
       As to the CQ reviewer who thought the design was "hippy", I guess he 
       never heard the design principle of form following function.  He probably 
       likes the XKE, long and thin, like an arrow (corners like an arrow as 
       well).  I prefer my cars to corner like a flying saucer, even if it means 
       a short wheelbase, wide track, and not much overhang.  
       
       The ABS also seems to be a cut above the average.  The one time I engaged 
       the ABS, with a hard stab, I felt a very high frequency, low amplitude, 
       pulsation, which stopped as soon as I released a little pressure.  Very 
       easy to modulate the brakes, even with ABS.  Frequency is at least twice 
       that of my wife's Saturn ABS (maybe more).  This should make trail 
       braking more tractable.
            
       I've had no trouble with the ragtop, except a couple of times (when I 
       didn't retract it fully, it wouldn't close until I recycled the 
       ignition).
          
       The engine sound is certainly different than traditional air-cooled 
       Pcars.  None of the sewing machine like engine clatter.  Much less of 
       the  throaty exhaust note (though there is some).  New in the sound 
       department is what sounds like two different frequencies of a 
       turbo-like whine, much like formula-one cars scream (but frequencies are 
       lower).
            
       It is impossible for me to keep the revs below 4200 (per US manual 
       recommendation).  Truth is I couldn't keep them below 5000 (ROW manual 
       break-in recommendation).  Good thing my dealer told me that keeping the 
       revs down is not an important break in requirement (confirmed in a 
       private e-mail from Bruce Anderson).  Speaking of revs. they climb 
       awfully fast.  I was amazed at how fast it accelerates from about 50 mph. 
        It certainly has enough power for me to scare myself at will, how much 
       more does one need, unless one is competing for large sums of cash.
       
               Negatives:
       
       
       I misjudged a curb located on the passenger side in a parking lot, and 
       scraped the underside of the bumper (OUCH!!!!).  Fortunately, it's only 
       visible from under the car (there goes the concurs).  I think I should 
       have ordered the boomerang (which my dealer never heard of) before taking 
       delivery.
       
               The left cup holder fell apart the first time I used it.  It has 
       nothing to hold it together.  It also caused one of the vent louvers to 
       pop out of place (I popped it back in place).   The cup holder thing is 
       tres tacky.
       
       
                Question:
       
       I heard from another Boxster owner I met at an autox that PCA (perhaps 
       zone 1) is only allowing Boxtsters to race if equipped with a 
       supplemental (higher) roll bar OR the hard top.  Can anyone confirm this?
       
       TAFN.
