     Hi all,
     
     I saw the Boxster aerokit on a black Boxster at my dealership 
     yesterday and thought I'd pass along info I saw and learned:
     
     The cost is $5750.  I assume this includes painting and installation.
     
     The front spoiler is deeper, but to me, otherwise looks similar to the 
     original one on my car.  I think the Road & Track picture of the 
     supposed "Boxster S" has this spoiler.
     
     The side skirts add a visual thickness, but to me, they are not 
     particularly different or more stylish when compared to the normal 
     sides.
     
     The rear is the most different.  The standard metal rear trunk lid is 
     completely replaced by a plastic one that has a small wing attached to 
     it.  The third brake light is integrated into the new wing.  To me, 
     the wing looks similar to what is optionally available on the BMW 
     3-series.  A picture is available on the Scottsdale Porsche dealership 
     web site.
     
     On the plastic trunk lid, where the metal trunk lid dips to expose the 
     third brake light, it is simply flush with the rest of the car body 
     above it.
     
     The retractable spoiler on the standard car is either disconnected 
     and/or removed, and the new plastic rear trunk comes down flush all 
     the way to cover up that area.
