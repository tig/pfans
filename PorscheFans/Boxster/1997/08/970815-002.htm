I am not sure about the horn beep significance.  It is clear that when the horn 
does not beep when using the remote locking feature, everything is tight.  And 
that might lead one to believe that if it does beep, then something is open.

In most cases, I have found that to be the case.  The front trunk may not be 
firmly latched, or the rear trunk is open, etc.  However, I have also had the 
horn beep, and upon checking, everything appeared to be closed.

Any idea what items being "insecure" might cause the horn to beep?

The boxster can be locked so that the doors *can* open from the inside, or so 
that they *cannot* be opened from the inside.  If you lock your car so the doors
cannot be opened from the inside, then the trunks cannot be opened (even if the 
top is down) using the levers next to the driver's seat because these only work 
when the driver's door is open.
     
How do you lock the car doors so they *don't* open from the inside? Just lock 
the car with the key once or press the key button on the key once if you have 
the remote locking feature.
     
If you want to be able to open the car doors from the inside (if you're leaving 
someone in the car, for instance) then you turn the key *twice* or press the 
button on the key *twice*.  If you use the remote key feature I think the horn 
beeps once to let you know the car is locked but "unsecure" (I'm not sure about 
the horn beep, I'll go out and try it, though).
     
Hope this helps-
Saludos,
Carlos
