The smoking on start up is due to an increase in the volume of oil sprayed up
under the piston. This is true of the 95 & up 911 engines as well as the
Boxter engine. This is also contributory to the oil consumption in later 911s
though the Boxter does not seem to consume nearly as much, assumably due to
lower cylender temps from liquid cooling. Smokin is at it's worst when a cold
engine is started and run a very short time then left to sit for a long
period. The next start will smoke like crazy.. 

As far as cleaning goes, a good sheepskin mit is the prefered tool, it will
float the dirt away from the surface during the wash, diapers, sponges and
other such items will not. 

Yes the prices are up on the 1998 cars, but lets face it, in 1992 Porsche
announced the Boxter and said then it would be under 40k.. When I met Fred
Schwab in '94 he told me the car would introduce under 40 "even if we have to
deliver it without a radio, it will be under 40". They did it and did it
quite well.. I don't know of another car available at 41k that performs,
handles and looks as good as a Boxter.. Certainly not the rival Z3 or SLK....


On the question of "chrome wheels", an absoult no-no on a Porsche. The wheel
is designed to dissapate heat from the brakes with the airflow thru the wheel
to cool it. If it is chromed, it does not dissapate the heat properly and can
result in overheating brakes. Polish them instead. 

Rumor has it the 98 cars will have hardtop hardware preinstalled regardless
of if the top is ordered or not. Havent seen one yet tho..

So, PSchiemer, who gave you that correction anyway? I am dying to know.  BTW
your key is here....
