This may be a problem with my computer if it is I'd like to know.  What I 
notice is that the messages which come over the PorscheFans.com address 
typically appear in duplicate or triplicate and often are repeated from one 
day to the next.  Is this the way the system is set up?  Seems like a waste of 
time scrolling through all of this stuff time and again. Like the third time I 
read the item about the guy who was in a quandary over the "correct" type of 
diaper to use on his Boxster.   A life I say, a life -please get a life.  

My Boxster arrives next week.  It will be my third Porsche and I've run all of 
them through the car wash on a regular basis.  It's just a car Boys.  As for 
the running comments on the Boomerang.  I presently have an M-3 which has 
ground clearance at the front spoiler of 4 1/2 .  I've whacked it once or 
twice going in odd angled driveways and now that im selling it I had the 
dealer repaint the spoiler and use the BMW bumper kit (would work on Porsche 
is Porsche has none like it) to touch up three years worth of scratches and 
nicks (which although not visible with out use of a dental mirror) which would 
have driven the buyer nuts.  None of the material I have gives the Boxster's 
ground clearance.  But from my experience if it is over 4 1/2 or  5" most 
drivers won't have any problems as long as they watch drive way entries and 
parking bumpers.  The boomerang gets the same dings and scratches but remains 
with the car for its life.  I'm not sure I get that approach.

One final item.  My Boxster was ordered with an onboard computer for about 
$450 . Apparently it is coming stateside without the computer which the dealer 
explains away as, "You know the factory only get these things right about 95% 
of the time."  They also told me that to obtain  the onboard computer and have 
it installed after market would cost upwards of 2K.  Whats up with that???  
Any suggestions on better pricing..

Thanks and patiently waiting.  Michael Moore  MDMLGM2@MSN.COM
