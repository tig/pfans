Thats a good theory for any car but a Boxster!

Has any one paid less than M.S.R.P? I understand that PCNA requires the
dealers to charge M.S.R.P., no less and no more. I paid sticker for mine
and hated it. I have seen used boxsters bring over sticker at the auction,
which makes me feel a little better about it.

 While were are putting in a good word for our dealers, I ordered my
Boxster the first week in April from Bert Smith International in St.
Petersburg Fla., and am taking delivery today, less than four months later!
They told me they were confident they could get me a car sooner than
anybody else and I believe they did. My local dealer (Metro Atlanta area)
told me a year and a half wait.
