Jon,

I have a similar routine, had the car since February 27th, 7,900 miles.
Top is cycled twice a 
day on average.  I am seeing two, circular wear patterns developing on
the convertible top,
where it appears to be rubbing against a support.  Next time I'm in to
the dealer (my replacement
visor is finally in) I'm going to show them the top and have them
contact the factory rep. 

Most of my stuff is stored in the rear trunk, (I like the remote open
feature) and have had
no cable  problems  to date.

Cheers, RC

shouldn't have)
