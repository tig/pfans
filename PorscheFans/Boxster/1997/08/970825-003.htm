engine?  

the only rumor that i'd feel comfortable standing by is that it will be 
an option.  size/power/etc. are all made up on the spot if you ask me.

well, as someone else pointed out, if you are interested in 
practicality, the m3 would be the hands-down winner.  it's got a real 
trunk and you can actually put people (adults!) in the back seat.  it's 
not, in my mind, a sports car.  it's definitely not a convertible.  it's 
a big old sedan with a monster engine.  just my opinion.
