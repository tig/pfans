After spending a bit of time with a Boxter today, I can shed some light on
the issue of securing the trunks.
 
If the alarm is set with ONE push of the button or turn of the key, the car
will be in the "secure" mode but the door can be opened from the inside if
you pull the handle several times rapidly (confuses the system). Once it
opens, the alarm sounds. You CANNOT open the trunks when the alarm is
sounding. There is a solinoid that locks the handles when the alarm is armed.
This mode cannot be bypassed unless you have the key. These solinoids will
also be engaged if you loose power such as if the battery is completely flat.


If the alarm is set with TWO pushes of the button or turns of the key, it is
in the interior safe mode. The door can then be opened with two pulls, first
one unlocks the car and disarms the alarm hence unlocking the trunks.  The
second opens the door normally. 

The trunks are opened via cable, running from handle to latch, with solinoids
only used to lock the handles. I know which fuse controls these, but dont
want to publicly post that kind of info here. There is also emergency
releases provided but again, am hesitant to post that info publicly.  

If anyone finds their car is not working as indicated, you must wait ten
seconds after activation for the system to go into full arm mode. I think it
is thirty seconds or maybe sixty before the interior monitoring kicks in..

Hope this long rambling clears up the questions....
