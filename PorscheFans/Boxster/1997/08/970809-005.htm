I feel bad about the demoralized/disgusted first time Porsche buyers, &
for Porsche. This is not how things normally go when dealing with
Porsche. IMHO, things we need to keep in mind:

This is a feeding frenzy & we're all in the middle of a supply/demand
thing. No one anticipated this much demand.

My dealer has behaved impeccably every step of the way. Those who have
not should have their name smeared across the Internet (but Porsche did
*not* instruct them to use these dubious methods).

What we're paying is *not* what Porsche receives. Perhaps the dollar has
held strong against the DM for longer than expected. The exchange rate
may very well have necessitated the price increase.

So it's $2,000 more - it's still a cheap Porsche! At our dealer, there
was a Boxster displayed near a Mustang 5.0 with bells & whistles. Price
difference was a few thousand. In 5 years, compare the value (&
appearance/body integrity) of those same 2 cars.
