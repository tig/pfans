I spent the day at my Porsche dealer.   Here's what I learned...

1) There is a problem with debirs entering the front air dams, dinging and/or
cloging up the radiators.  Over time,  this will certainly take its toll.
 You can check out your own car by simply shining a flashlight in the
opening.  Pay close atttention to any indentions in the facing.  PorscheFX
(www.PorscheFX.Com) is developing an insert screen to keep this stuff out
without loosing air flow.  (By the way, the picture of the Boxster S in
"Automobile" has a different front bumper opening - perhaps to address this
issue?)

2) The new heat shields (mounted on the rear transmission support bracket)
are only arriving on the sticks.  The tips have a different configuration.
 If you have an early 5-speed boxster you may want to look into aquiring this
part to protect you shift linkage.

3) Although no light came on, both my seat belts registered faults.  Next
time you take your Boxster in for servicing have them run the diagnositc (the
belt receptors  are a common problem).  Any by the way, the Porsche lap top
computer is really cool.

4) Those of you reporting the horn beep when you turn on the alarm
(indicating a non-closed connection) may want to check out the Passenger
sensors (above the rear view mirror).  Mine were defective and are being
replaced.  Again, the Porsche lap top computer will tell you exactly where
the fault is. 

5) After taking a hit on my front bumper the Bommerang did its job.  It got
scratched up, but no damage to the bumper or radiators.

6) Upgrading the upgraded Porsche sound system (which made a huge difference)
can be done without any cutting or modifications to the car

7) For those you with coolant leaks - Porsche has the fix...
