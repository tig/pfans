 I take exception to the fact that Vyrad seems to feel that having a
boomerang installed is a girl's thing.  My husband ordered it for OUR car...
and is an engineer and feels like it is a good thing.

Incidently, I am a competitive PCA driver and have also act as driving
instructor so I am far from a female who is only worried about protecting her
car.  There are a lot of us females out here that appreciate the Porsche
Marque and really enjoy driving our cars as they were made to be driven... So
please be careful when sterotyping females.
