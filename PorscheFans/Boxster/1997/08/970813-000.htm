     Read with much amusement the tennis match of emails on 0-60 times, 
     just thought I'd add my 100yen's worth here
     
     Autocar's (UK) 0-60 mph was 6.5 seconds. As a point of interest the 
     car is quoted (by Porsche) as having 204hp (rather than 201) in the UK 
     and also here in Japan. Is there maybe some catalyst difference in the 
     USA? Is there one model for all states including California?
     
     From memory (don't have the Brochure at work:) Porsche Japan quote 
     6.9seconds, but that's for 0-100kmh (62.5mph for the uninitiated).
     
     0-100mph time is also interesting, Autocar got 18 seconds for this. 
     911 is around 13 (?). Autocar commented on the good 0-60, compared to 
     what they considered a rather poor 0-100 time.
     
     Any offers for comments or an accurate 911 0-100 number (in the 
     absence of my large pile of car magazines)?
     
     As an aside, a large number of my car mag collection reside in the 
     "bathroom", much to my other half's annoyance. Its a constant battle 
     to retain a suitably diverse Library in there...any one else have a 
     similar problem?
     
     Cheers

     PS I'm not really obsessed with performance, if I was I would have 
     bought a Nissan Skyline V spec. Its cheaper than a Boxster here (just) 
     and its the fastest road car clocked round the Nurburgring (spelling?) 
     in Germany.
     
     PPS I thought it was appropriately British to introduce a toilet 
     reference:)
