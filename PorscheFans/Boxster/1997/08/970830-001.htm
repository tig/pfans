I wrote yesterday:
Can anyone tell me where the 8 speakers are located in the Hi Fi/8
speaker option.  I believe there are two each on top of the right & left
dash, one each on each door, but for the life of me I can't find the
other two!  Also, when I toggle the fader to the rear, I hear nothing in
the rear!! Am I missing two speakers?



As nothing came back to me other than you telling me you had the same
question I decided to make my own inquires of Porsche. The reply from
the dealer was that "8 speakers is a misnomer, there are only 6"  I told
the dealer that this if this was so, then the sticker, and option list
was wrong and misleading and should be corrected, and I should be
compensated. I then called the head shed in Reno, spoke to a nice fellow
(Ben Hogen), who seemed to really know his stuff.  Very patient with me,
as I asked about some other trivia as well. His authoritative answer to
the questions were as follows:

1) There are 8 speakers, but none in the rear.  There are two on the
dash on each side, and what appears to be one each in the door panels is
actually two covered by one screen. (I think to confirm I will take the
screen off and see for my self.

2) Asked him about oil, and found that all Boxsters for North America
come with Mobil 1, 5-50.

3) Asked about adding additives (I especially wanted to know if they
would help during the break in period), and got a very vehement NO,
don't add additives.

Hope this adds a closure to some other folks' trivia questions.

Steve
