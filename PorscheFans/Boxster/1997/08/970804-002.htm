[I actually sent this on Sunday, but the list server rejected my
message saying: "jjd@jjd.com is not allowed to post to the list." New
feature? ]

I haven't read the actual review in GQ, so I can only comment on what
I read in the email message.

> "Porsche has done it again.  By which I mean just like the 914, the

Is this really true?  Antique generally means 25 years old or more.
Is the Boxster better than a 1972 911?  I would think that in almost
every way, the 1997 Boxster is significantly better than the '72 911.
Better performance, better handling, better styling.  Probably better
fun/dollar ratio if you correct the price for twenty five years.

I would think that this mailing list proves that it does stimulate
"irrational longings."  I've had more than one person come up to me and
say "I have a poster of your car in my office".  Clearly false.

> First the body.  It's uncomfortably wide for what should be a compact car.  .

Well, what can I say about this.  Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder.  I'm sure there were many reviewers who didn't like the
911's shape when it first came out, preferring the 356.  From the
comments I get, I think the majority of people think the styling is
superb.  As to "can't tell whether it is coming or going" -- what's
the problem here?  That's probably one of the reasons I like the
styling.  For a graphic demonstration of the pushme-pullyou nature of
the styling, check out Andrew Potts' photo:

Again, each body is different.  I've driven 2hr+ trips in perfect
comfort.

I don't know what he's talking about.  Everytime the tachometer
crosses the 4k boundary, the engine sound puts a big smile on my face.

I think this guy is just on the wrong frequency.  He complains about
lots of the exact same things others laud.  Either he went out of his
way to write a bad review, or he is just different the me and the
other Boxster owners (and owner-wannabes) I know.

On the other hand, if I lived in the UK as he does, I would have taken
a long hard look at the Lotus Elise and the Renault Sport Spider.
