Andrew Chan sent in a question as to why only the left rear fog light comes on 
in the Boxster. 
Here in Europe (I live in France) all cars must have at least one rear fog 
light, by law. The cheaper cars generally have one on the left (the passing 
side), whereas more expensive cars have two.
My Boxster was delivered here in Paris, and I soon noticed that only the left 
rear fog light would come on. Upon inspection, my car had a bulb on the right 
side, and the proper wiring, but no electricity on that side. Further research 
revealed that Porsche had left that circuit disconnected at the junction box 
located in the rear trunk, right next to the engine firewall, in the forward 
left lower corner (behind the carpet)! Why they do this, is a mystery to me.
One spade connector later, I now have two fog lights! If you are interested, 
the fog light wires are gray with a white stripe, and their junction box in 
the trunk is the black one (there are three of them altogether-the others are 
yellow and red).

Regards,
FGV
