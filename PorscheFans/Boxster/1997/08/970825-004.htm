Gotta disagree with you here Mark.  My little brother has an M3,
in which I have both driven sportingly and passengered at lunatic
speeds, and the handling, braking, and acceleration of that car 
are simply amazing.  (In other words, it's a lot more than a 
powerful engine - this car's sporting capabilities are nothing 
short of startling.)  I'm still getting a Boxster, which takes a 
completely different philosophical tack (that roadster state of 
mind), but the M3 is as sporting as they come, IMHO.  It just also 
happens to have real back seats...
