To save me the trouble of finding where I can buy the boomerang, would
someone pls email me the address and phone number of the vendor?

My arena red, beige leather boxster, with 80 miles is still for sale.  I
have just come back from vacation, and will consider all offers.  I want
only what I paid (53K). Sports package, hardtop, etc. etc.

Want to buy a Silver, with Tip, anyone got any ideas?

I considered both the Boxster and the Corvette (98 model). Test drove
the Corvette, but not the Boxster.  Had it out for three hours, driving
like hell.  Was turned off the Corvette, and so was the wife and
daughter (age 18). When I finally drove the Boxster, nothing changed.
However, I would like more get-up-and-go.

Saw the MB SL top holder. Very nice. on castors, and very light &
portable.  Ordered one at $200.00.  However, I like the idea of the one
hanging from the ceiling.  It reminds me of the days of my 300 SL, had
to leave the damn hardtop on the lawn while I took the car out on nice
days. (I am talking about the 300 SL of the '62 vintage, not the baby
SL's that came out later).
