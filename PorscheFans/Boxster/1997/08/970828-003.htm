Had my car in for an oil change.  Actually saw a real-life Boxster with the
boomer on it.

Okay, I'll give you it probably does what it claims - but, hey, so what?

Has anyone else noticed that most of the people putting these on are ladies
(the one at my dealership was and just take a look at who posting in favor of
this)  I know it's not P.C. but I think the fairer sex is a lot more worried
about "blemishes" than us guys.

I say drive, baby, drive!  And let the stones and road stuff land where they
may.  In three years you can always repaint or  trade it in for a Boxster S!
 Jeez people - let's move on in our lives!!!
