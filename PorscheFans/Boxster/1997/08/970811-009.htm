MotorTrend had a special on TNN (I think) last week about various
automobiles.  During the show, they did a 5 minute special on the Boxster. 
They absolutely loved everything about the car.  They ran the car through
several tests.  Using all their state-of-the-art timing equipment, they
clocked the Boxster from 0 to 60 mph in 6 seconds flat.  I am picking up my
car in about two hors, so I haven't had the opportunity to really try out
0-60 myself, but I do know the manual says 6.7 seconds (7.4 for tiptronic). 
What have other people been finding?  Why would Porsche say 6.7 if the car
can do it in 6.0?  MotorTrend described their configuration as a stock 201hp
Boxster, so I assume they don't have anything different then what we have.
