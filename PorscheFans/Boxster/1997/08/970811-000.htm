Hi All!

I just took delivery of my Arctic Silver/Boxster Red Boxster this weekend 
and have been groovin' on it all weekend! This baby kicks so much ass it 
ain't even funny. I wish I had subscribed to this list before I got the 
car. I just went back through a bunch of the archives and I found out a 
couple of things that I wish I would have known. 

Mainly, it's the whole center console issue. I only test drove the car 
once and I thought it felt like the accelerator was a bit far off to the 
right cuz my leg was really jammed up against the center console, but I 
guess I never realized that you could order it without the center 
console. Then, when I saw the picture of it (page 66/67 of Boxster 
brochure) without the center console, I was REALLY bummed. I think it 
looks much classier without it! So, anyway, I read a bunch of your 
discussion about there being wires and junk back there, but I never heard 
any real resolution. Is this something I can have the dealer do after 
I've already gotten the car? How much do you 'spose something like that 
would cost? Or can I do it myself? (I would think not, since someone was 
saying the carpet's all messed up back there.)

The only other complaint I had about the Boxster are the god-awful airbag 
stickers! I was reading in the list that someone had had good luck using 
Polly S Easy Lift Off decal remover, so I bought some of that and some 
Goo Gone adhesive remover and I am going to try that out in the next 
couple of days unless I hear some cries of warning from this list (I'll 
check back first before I do it). My dealer told me to try turpentine (!) 
which seems a bit harsh! This stuff is made for plastic models, so it 
seems like it should work okay without screwing up the plastic.

Anyone know of a good after-market holder for the hardtop? I saw someone 
mention a Mercedes one. How much does one of them cost? Right now it's 
just sitting on my garage floor wrapped in a bedspread. Hardly seems 
fitting for a Porsche.

Let's see, what else? Well, I read everyone's recommendations for 
cleaning the car (leather, rear window, wax, etc.) But I didn't see any 
recommendations for a good alloy wheel cleaner. Any suggestions? Also, is 
anyone in the process of compiling a Boxster FAQ? If there isn't, then 
there should be! I would be happy to take up the gauntlet if anyone else 
isn't interested.

Well, I guess that's it for now. This is my first Porsche, and I am not 
disappointed! I traded in a 1996 BMW 328is, which I thought drove pretty 
good...Until now. Oh, and by the way, before the BMW, I had a Honda Del 
Sol, and it did start under $20,000. It was actually a pretty great car, 
I thought. If the press release is true, I think Porsche could do a lot 
worse.

See ya!
Chris
