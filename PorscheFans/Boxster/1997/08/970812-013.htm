    Jim:

    Well, I can't even SPELL "optimistic", so we're even.

    Your point is, of course, valid... But if you take a historical
    look at Motor Trend's test data, you'll see that their numbers
    are almost ALWAYS better than the other magazines'. 

    This, coupled with their editors' well-known tendency to
    shamelessly fawn over every car that's advertised in their
    magazine, doesn't give me a whole lot of faith in the accuracy
    of their testing... Which is all I was trying to say in my
    original message.

    In general, I DO believe Car and Driver's numbers, although
    personally, I'm MOST confident with AutoWeek's test data...
    Mostly because AutoWeek's testing is performed by someone I
    trust: Our list-master, Pete Albrecht.

    If you think about it, Porsche's own published test data almost
    HAS to be conservative... I mean, if the car magazines all get
    BETTER performance than Porsche's claims, everyone's happy.  If,
    on the other hand, no one but Motor Trend can (allegedly) match
    the published performance numbers, that can lead to a bad
    reputation for Porsche and (possibly) allegations of misleading
    advertising.
