Well, I did it.  After several months of internal debate I went ahead and
upgraded the upgraded factory stereo.  This included 2 ads p240 amps, ads
335is speakers/tweeters in addition to the Kenwood 9007 reciever  (the
stealth face plate could not be a better match for the Boxster).  It was an
easy plug and play.  No cutting or modifications were made to the car.

The difference in sound?  Huge.  Keeping in mind that I was impressed with
the factory upgrade, this system is a quantum leap forward.   You might ask
since I've changed all the componants did I waste $600 on the stereo otpion.
 No.  The upgraded Porsche door pannels prevented the need for costly
modification - they themsleves were worth the money.

One other thing.  When I was leaving the shop I scraped my front end on their
drive (I didn't even think it was that steep).  The Boomerang - as designed -
took the scrapes and saved my bumper.  My guess is most Boxster owners are
going to experience something like this sooner or later.    I can't recommend
it highly enough.
