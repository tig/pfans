Darius,

I had a problem with the dealer here in Dallas, so I canceled my place in
line and got my deposit back.  You and I are not the only ones that have had
a problem with the dealers.  I personally know of four in the DFW area and
all canceled their place in line.  All of these, like myself, are long time
Porsche fans, we all own and have owned Porsche for years.  I even wrote to
Fred Schawb at PCNA and got a rude response from one of his flunkies, her
letter informed me that it is Fredrick Schawb Jr and that the dealers are
independently owned and PCNA can not (will not as long as they are selling
cars) do anything.  She did say she would forward my letter to the dealer
and the region rep for their response. Been two months and have not heard
anything.  Back a few years ago this same dealer was very customer oriented
and would bend over backwards for you.  Of course at that time they were not
selling many cars.  Now they have a hot product and they know if you do not
buy then there will be another customer to take your place. So, instead of
the Boxster I found a nice '88 911 with 40K miles on it for less that half
of what I would have paid for the Boxster and my wife like it better.

My advise is if you really want the car hang in there.  If not punt and wait
a year or so when the demand drops off (remember the Miata) and get better
treatment and better deal (the mark up is over $5000) or find a used one
with most of the equipment you want.  Or better yet find a good 356 cab or
coupe and join a great bunch of guys and gals that love the old Porsches and
have a great time driving and working on the TUB's
