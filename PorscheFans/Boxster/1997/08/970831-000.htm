We picked up our arctic silver/black Boxster Thursday, August 28--after a
seven
month wait (got on waiting list February 1; placed order early April).
 Salesman (R. Wolfsen) at Rockville Porsche-Audi, Rockville, MD is a great
guy--straightforward,
no BS, a pleasure to work with.  Kept us informed all along the way.

The car is beautiful and does turn heads.  Most people don't know what it
is--and are
surprised to learn it is a Porsche. 

Handles well on parkways and secondary roads in and around DC--haven't had a
chance to get out of town.  Had planned to take some day trips this weekend,
but
the "check engine" light came on and stays on, idle is a little rough, and
service
at the dealership advised bringing it in after the holiday weekend--may need
an O2
sensor adjustment or the like.  Has anyone else had a similar problem?

Also, noticed that some of the lighted displays (clock, odometer, LED speedo)
stay on when car is turned off.  These lights do go off when alarm button is
activated on the key fob.  Is this "normal"?
