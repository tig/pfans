Darius,
Sounds like the dlr. isn't communicating very well, thats too bad
because it can be a lot of fun working on options and putting the car
together. Here's a couple of tips from one of us that had the 'deposit'
in over 2 yrs ago before placing the order(& then another 2-5 mo).
#When you deposit ask&know how many are definately on list ahead of you.
#How many more cars do they expect to get allocated before say Jan 1
    (some dlrs would also like to know the exact answer to this quest)
Obviously if your #5 & they may get 4 more allocations, you're probably
looking @98  all cars are not 'customer' spec'ed so they're kinda wild
cards that eat up an allocation.
#Lastly, I'ld ask, "do you mind if I call from time to time to see where
I am on the list or if allocation #s have changed?"
If you don't get good answers to the above, chances are it might not be
a fun wait and you should move on to another dlr.   Good Luck.

Other subjects(to save space)  Cabrio Top Preservative? I've used
Mercedes "Soft Top Preservative", good product, $11. @ your local MB Dlr
                               Top closing problem?  more prevalent with
people that got hard top &/or early X options. The top just hasn't been
up since production (X's sat around longer). Get it wet, leave it out,
it gets better.      Gregg
