First, the Car and Driver article refers to the best handling cars.  Handling
contributes to but does not completely define fun.  Handling does not include
craftmanship, engine symphonics, looks, sex appeal, panache (snob appeal?),
and fun of an open top car.  If they did, I we might have seen the Boxster
move up in their rankings and the Ferrari would have eaten the M3.

I went to a local Chevy dealer. New coupe for list; convertible C5 for $5k
over list.  I drove the C5 in their large parking lot; they wouldn't let me
take it on the road.   Definitely much improved over the C4 as the car
periodicals have said.  BUT....Hands down I'm glad I'm getting the Boxster:
less power but more fun, better looks in my opinion, a convertible that is
easier to open and close (much less effort than the C5 targa or convertible),
much more thrilling engine music, and will last more years than any GM car.
