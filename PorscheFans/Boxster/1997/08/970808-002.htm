When I was taking delivery of my car, the dealer started another Boxster to 
demonstrate a special exhaust and a small puff of smoke came out of the 
tailpipe.  My dealer also told me that it's perfectly natural for any 
Porsche (911 or Boxster) to burn a little oil until about 10,000 miles when 
they magically stop.  He told me I should use the electronic oil reading on 
the dash before starting to judge when to add a quart (Mobil 1 synthetic 
only).  Maybe this is because of the ceramic coated pistons and cylinders? 
(I defer this question to the Porsche engine experts).

That's a good point.  We have a Subaru that has a boxer and it doesn't
smoke on startup.  Maybe you need six cylinders for smoke? : )
