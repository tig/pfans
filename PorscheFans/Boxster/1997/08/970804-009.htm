One thing I have learned: if you want to find a critical review of any car
not produced in England, read a British magazine. Even when reading
comparisons between three german cars, some comment about 'of course if a
(insert British car here) were included in the group, there would be no
question...' always seems to sneak in. After reading pagefulls of serious
objective criticisms on the gross inadequacies of a given English car, only
to have them dismissed in favor of that 'ineffable something' subjective
that makes it superior to the imports, I take everything I read in the
British mags with a grain of salt.

On the subject of design, after having a British reviewer compare the
Boxster's interior unfavorably against that of the Chimaera (!), I have
completely lost faith in the objectivity of the British Automotive press.
The Boxster, to my mind, has one of the most well-detailed interiors of any
sportscar in recent memory and successfully attempts some interesting,
contemporary forms without loosing control of them as most recent American
design does (anything from GM in the last decade). The Chimaera, on the
other hand, boasts a clumsy, kit-car like interior that has to be seen to
be believed. As to the exterior, the Boxster is now added to my list of
only two cars (the 911 being the other) currently in production that have
well-resolved, sensual form development that I will never tire of (the
current RX-7 almost made the list, but is just a tad over-worked. Couldn't
they have left at least one or two lines alone, for contrast?). The
Boxster's proportions and architecture are unique and unmistakable, a
refreshing departure from 'the Tyranny of the Wedge' (to quote my old boss
Gerry Hirschberg's over-used mantra for the J30) that defines 85% of the
cars on the market, of any genre. Those uncomfortable with the
push-me-pull-you character should defend why it doesn't bother them on an
unimpeachable classic like the 550 Spyder, for example. If they don't like
that one either then they are arguing a matter of taste, not design
execution.

Seriously, though, I've found the English automotive press to be insightful
and not afraid to be critical while everybody else is simply gushing.
That's why I still pick up Car and the odd Top Gear. It was in the U.K.
press that I found the only criticism of the TC and ABD on the Boxster, for
example, something that seems to have been overlooked by everyone else (I
can look up which issue if anyone's interested). That objectivity just
seems to break down whenever anything sporting a Union Jack comes along
(Any Canadians out there who have grown up with BBC reporting of F1 events
can attest to the somewhat, uh, biased coverage). The U.S. press, by
contrast, seems to believe that the Europeans (especially Germans) can do
no wrong.

Anyway, forgive the admittedly gross generalisations expressed above. This
is obviously a very subjective personal view, and ment mostly to express my
impressions over the course of many years' reading and the 'filters' I use
when reading reviews. I have read good and bad, purely objective and
grossly nationalistic reviews in magazines of all camps, and I'm not
intending to say that Mr. Blayley's review is colored in that sense, since
he is obviously comparing the car with the 911, rather than the Elise, for
example (unless that is, by chance, mentioned somewhere in the article that
has not been reprinted? ;-) ). Mostly this is meant to start a rousing
discussion of design! I yield the floor...

Phil.
