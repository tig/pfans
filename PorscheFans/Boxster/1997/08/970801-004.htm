They also are allowed an 'advertising' charge that is 'non-negotiable'.  It
should only be about $400-$500 or so, but it is still acceptable, and you
will not be able to get around it.

Beyond that, I wouldn't pay anything over the (true) dealer invoice + dest
+ 5% for profit. Unfortunately, the Boxster like many limited edition (or
even mass produced European Sport Sedans) get's the sticker price and the
dealers know this and may be unwilling to deal.

My biggest suggestion for anyone buying a new car is this... Research,
research, research.  Know the prices, know the options.  Buy what you want,
and only pay what it's worth.  If a dealer doesn't 'deal', walk out the
door.  There are many Porsche dealers out there, and you are bound to find
one who is willing to sell the car for what you are willing to pay.  Buy
the options after-market if they are exactly the same and are cheaper.  Be
smart, $50K in anyone's budget is significant, and like a broker researches
stock, you should research this purchase.

I put car-buying in a whole different perspective than most people.  I
consider it an expense/loss.  It is not an investment, and unless you can
afford to store if for 25 years, you probably won't get your money back on
it.
