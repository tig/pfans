     Hi All,
     
     I've been watching the mails fly back and forth whilst I'm awaiting 
     delivery of my Silver Boxster on 4th September. I'm a Brit living in 
     Japan.
     
     I'll be taking delivery of one of the few RHD cars expected here 
     (Japan drives on the left but everyone still buys LHD cars...don't ask 
     me why).
     
     Anyhow, this follows on from Phil Saunders email about British Car 
     Mags. I think Autocar (weekly) is generally the best since it is 
     reasonably free of hyperbole of the GQ type.
     
     The "Interior" thing comes from the fact that the British Auto-press 
     has criticised the interior of the Boxster for a) not being as cool as 
     the prototype b) being rather plastic and c) the full leather being 
     2500 pounds extra.
     
     I sort of agree with the "Plastic" comments - and thus paid the extra 
     cash for a full Boxster Red interior. 
     
     TVR - a friend in the UK who's awaiting a Boxster related a story from 
     a Porsche dealer in the UK, that people are trading TVRs against 
     Boxsters because the TVR is too fast and too scary. 
     
     Note for those in the US complaining about delays, that this guy 
     expects delivery in May 98 and he ordered in January this year.
     
     GQ, fully agree with the "why compared to 911" comments, since Porsche 
     still makes the 911, why on earth would they want the Boxster to be 
     similar and superior to it? Surely its meant to be modern and have a 
     different philosophy.
     
     Will send a report on driving experiences in Japan once I've got the 
     car.
     
     Cheers
     
     Dan.
     
     PS Did people in the US get the cheesy video with Patrick Stewart 
     (Jean Luc Picard) narrating?
