I have the black/black combo (partial leather) and have had my car out on a 
few 90+ degree days.  I was also worried about the heat from a black 
interior but didn't really experience the feeling that the interior was 
adding to the already hot day.  I had one other convertible with a black 
interior and I remember it being hotter (In my present case, I might have 
been too thrilled to notice!).

I have a black/black on order to be built in Sept. and have a few days left
to change options if I so desire.  I'm concerned about the heat with the
black/black color combo in south FL and am considering tan interior.  I have
heard that the tan dash provides a lot of reflection off the windshield and 
a
tan interior is harder to keep clean in a convertible.  I'd appreciate your
input, advice, experience about my dilemma.
