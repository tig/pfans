Recent (and previous) posting about this car (the 'S' Boxster) beg
clarification of the sources and the "orders" posted. I have had
conversations over the last several months concerning this car with both
my local dealer, PCNA, and Porsche at the '97 Parade and as recently as
last Wednesday with PCNA personnel at a Porsche Dealerships' Grand
Re-Opening (ownership change) private party, and have consistently
gotten the same story - it has not been (fully?) developed, is not a
production model, is not scheduled to produced (yet), orders for the car
are not being accepted - period. So why all the stories about dealers
who are "ordering" cars and people who are already talking about
delivery dates ? My dealer and the PCNA rep on Wednesday both noted that
these dealers are just accepting people $'s for a imaginary place in a
line that doesn't officially exist (yet) - and if that makes them feel
better that's fine --- as long as the dealer is being truthful about
what the "deposit" is holding - hope! 
You'll notice I kept adding (yet). It's obvious through the media that
continued development of this car is happening, that's the Porsche way.
Porsche isn't denying that an "improved car" isn't undergoing testing,
but at the same time they are saying it isn't available - period. In
April I went to the Dealership to order the car (proded by reports of
"orders" off this list) - General Manager stated he had just returned
from dealers meeting (in Atlanta I believe) at which Porsche had told
them "don't accept orders for an 'S' Boxster - it doesn't exist and if
it is developed will likely not be available until 2000" . He could have
easily said "sure we'll take your deposit - don't have details but we'll
let you know when we do." But he didn't. Wednesday the PCNA rep stated
that even at the recently doubled production rate for the Boxster there
is no room and no need to inject a different model into the schedule -
at least in the near future.
Well we can all hope! and some can apparently put down $'s to help them
hope! Maybe Porsche will suddenly change their minds as they just did
with the pricing annoucment for '98 models. There wasn't alot of time
between "no price change" and "Price Change" now was there? Like I said
"We can Hope". In the meantime - I wonder what other aftermarket goodies
will come along that I can use to help my Boxster (Speed Yellow, P38) on
down the road until that "S" version shows up?
If anyone can give us a different version of what's happening with the
"S" I and apparently PCNA would like to here it!
