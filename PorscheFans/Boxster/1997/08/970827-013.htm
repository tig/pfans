The Boxster Boomerang is not designed as a structural saftey device.  It is
simply an excellent barrier against cosmetic damage that will also help
protect the radiators and condensors by diffusing the energy along the lower
front bumper in the event of a low speed impact.  

For $300 that's a bargin to me.

My husband, an engineer, spent 45 minuteson the phone  with the inventor of
the device - Jeff Korda, before we purchased it.  Someone posted a message
saying they wanted to hear about the  boomerang's benefits from a Certified
Porsche Mechanic.  Jeff Korda IS a certified Porsche mechanic.  A 23-year
permier Porsche mechanic who has installed hundreds of these (a slightly
different design) on 911s with superb results.

To put this isssue to rest once and for all,  I suggest anyone remotely
serious about the boomerang contact Mr. Korda directly for additional
information on testing, design, and benefits.
