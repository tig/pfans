I ordered Savannah Biege for that same reason.

I'd appreciate your >input, advice, experience about my dilemma.

I didn't notice how bad the reflection really was until I read your post.
Now I can't keep from looking at it. I think the black dash also has a
reflection but you can't see it because it's black. If look on the
windshield above the interior sensor you can it's reflection. You can also
see the the reflection of the defrost vents if you look hard enough. But,
YES the Biege leather dash has a very noticable reflection on the
windshield(of course this is only on sunny days!).

On that subject does any one have any ideas? I thought about one of those
dash protectors that looks like a piece of carpet, in black. But, I don't
want to ruin the appearence of my interior either.
