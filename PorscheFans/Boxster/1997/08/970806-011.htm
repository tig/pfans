     I dropped by my dealership yesterday with my Boxster to have something 
     looked at, and my salesman mentioned that the MSRP for '98 just got 
     raised to ~$41,000.  I didn't ask him for any more specifics, like 
     whether the option prices have changed either.
     
     As background info...
     
     When Porsche AG (PAG Germany) set the U.S. '97 price as $39,980, 
     apparently Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) had lobbied hard to set 
     it at that.  That price was lower than in Europe.  As a result of PCNA 
     "winning" that battle, PAG lowered the US allocation after March '97 
     so they could sell more Boxsters in Europe at higher prices.

Placed a deposit of $3000 on a 98 Boxster with Negherbon Porsche in Oakland CA 
2 months ago. According to the dealer, 12/97 allocation
i.e. 1/98 delivery. Price stated was MSRP plus destination fee and applicable 
taxes.
     
When I went by the dealership last week to pick up the new options and  price 
list it stated that the base price hadn't been increased compared to 97, but 
most options had increased in price by about 2.5%. The salesman told me at that 
time that I would have to specify options within the next several weeks.
     
I was quite suprised when I recieved a message from the salesperson yesterday 
stating that "Porsche" had decided to increase the base price by $1000 and that 
I should let him know what I wanted to do. He said he was sorry to have to tell 
me this, but that it was "Porsche's decision".
     
I was even more suprised when I didn't  find any discussion of this at 
PorscheFans last night.
     
It seems unlikely that Porsche would do this so soon after releasing their long 
awaited, presumably heavily pondered decision about 98 prices.
     
Any experiences, opinions, advice?
