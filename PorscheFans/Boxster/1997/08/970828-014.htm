Sorry, I didn't mean to sound like the net police - that isn't really like
me.  It just seems that lately with topics like the Boomerang, Corvettes, M3,
etc., we end up getting 30+ mails on the same subject, but all with different
subject lines.  If their was just one "Boomerang" and 29 "Re: Boomerang",
then I could just grab them all and delete them since I am tired of hearing
about the thing (no offense to the authors, I'm just not interested). 
Anything without "Re:", I try to take the time to read since I think it is a
totally new post.

At the same time, I too am tired of reading previous days' mail included in
new mails (the downfall of using reply).  I don't mind a sentence or two for
some context of the original question, but to include an entire digest or a
lengthy mail is a bit much.

Anyway, you summed it up nicely - not a big deal.  Back to Boxsters...

- Steve
