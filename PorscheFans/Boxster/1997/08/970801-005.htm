 I'm being quoted dealer preparation charges for my new Boxster of $800.  
 Before I go to the mat over this can anyone tell me their experience with 
 respect to this fee.  Also arguing over added cost of chrome wheels.  What
has 
 your experience been in this regard.  Thanks very much for any help anyone
may 
 offer

Nice dealer you have.  Our agreed price was MSRP which, of course, does not
include anything called dealer prep.  The only adder to my tab was $42(?) for
documentation - a fee controlled in Illinois.

BTW the dealer prep for my Boxster was to wash it and put on the license
plate frames.  Also, I seem to recall that several years ago (10 or so) the
factory recommended against chroming wheels. 

Good luck - read your contract closely (preferably before you sign it) and
find a good dealer.
