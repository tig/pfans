I'm fairly new, too.  We've had ours for about a week now...

Most likely you didn't get the rag-top all the way down before putting the
hard top on.  We were having this problem.  Keep running the top down until
the light goes off - same on the up process.

>2) What does the US manual say about break in period? My car is a US spec

I believe that ours says 1000 miles and no more than 4200 RPM

Have to say this is a great little car.  It's tough to choose in the
mornings now - motorcycle or car?
