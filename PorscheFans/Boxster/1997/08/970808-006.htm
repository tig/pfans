HARDTOP  I did not order it.  However, it definitely has less head room than
the soft     
                  top.  About 2-3"  FYI.  I.e., my head is fine with the soft
top up but hit 
                  the roof with the hard top.  (I'm 6' 2").

PRICE        Suppposedly increased base to around $41,100.

DELAY        Champion, supposedly the largest dealer in the US has me slated
for
                   Sept-Oct delivery after my deposit was placed May 1996.
 Something 
                   stinks but I don't care anymore.  I have my pride; they do
not.

OPTIONS     I really have lost much respect for Porsche.  It seems they have
poor  
                  coordination.  Eg-I inquired about the adjustable lumbar
support which is 
                   "available." They don't know how much it will cost and
when it will be   
                  available.
