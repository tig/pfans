that "one other" must be the one pag used when supplying the original 
0-60 times of 6.7 seconds - they must have been going 0-66 instead  that 
would help account for the mags getting substantially better times...  
:-)

more seriously, i would find that to be annoying.  of course, it could 
be that the radar warning thingie isn't calibrated correctly.  i'm more 
concerned about your engine and the outcome of that ordeal.
