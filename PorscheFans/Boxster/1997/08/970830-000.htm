That starting problem I've had may be corrected.
Seems the connector at the back of the ignition had a loose tine.  Just
enough to not send signal to (probably) the fuel pumps.  So, intermittent
function.  Replaced the connector to the switch.
It was, definitely, not the security system nor the key heads (as we once
thought).  
Lots of trial and error experimentation.

Must comment that my dealership is proficient in taking care of nuisance
problems like this, as well adept at making that extra effort to attend to
small, seemingly insignificant things.
For instance;  my car was a mess after the trip.  Hadn't had time to wash it.
They cleaned the car for me.  
Not through an automated car wash system, by hand. [Porsche frowns on
automated, brush style wash systems for their cabrio autos.]
Not by a crew of detail persons, but by the receptionist in the service
department.
"Didn't want those bugs to ruin the paint, and everyone else was busy."  was
her only comment.

That's excellent service.
