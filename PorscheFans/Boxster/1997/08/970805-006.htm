I think it may be the case that nothing is wrong.  People have
mentioned on this forum that this is a common occurance in 911 engines
and may be an artifact of any flat engine.  It happens in my boxster
occasionally and if I hadn't seen people talk about it here, it would
worry me.  It seems to happen more if you run the car briefly (say
moving it around a driveway) and then let it sit.

When it happens to me, there is a big puff on starting and then
everything is normal 30 seconds later.

Someone, upon seeing such a puff of smoke, said  "Ah, the Boxster *is* a
real Porsche..."
