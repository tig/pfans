I am unsure if this message got posted previously.  It seems important enough to
post again, but apologies if it is redundant.

My Boxster vin 1036 developed a ticking the valve train.  Sort of like an out of
adjustment solid lifter.  Took it to my dealer saying I didn't think this noise
was supposed to be there.  They concurred and after discussing it with PCNA,
have decided to put a brand spanking new engine in the car.  Seems that they
don't want the dealers opening the engines.  Mine will be boxed up and sent back
to the fatherland for investigation.  Guess they want to keep the new 996 owners
happy by making sure that no inherent problems exist.

The engine is here and will be put in after Labor Day.  I will keep all of you
posted on the outcome.

I have a problem that I have not seen addressed and would like to know if anyone
else notices this.  At 55 miles per hour as indicated on both speedos, the car
is actually travelling a 50.  A 10% difference.  I live in the DC area and the
park police have set up radar warning devices which read your speed.  I have
varied the speed that I travel through them, but it seems that I have a
consistent 10% variance.  My dealer says they have heard of one other.
Comments?
