Hi to all,

I am new to the Boxster digest, but not to Porsche.  I am glad to hear you
all are enjoying the Boxster and there is at least one good dealership in
the US. I should have had one by now, but had the bad dealership experience,
they had my money since last September.  I even wrote Fred Schwab at PCNA
explaining my experiences and received a letter back from Susan Elbe PCNA
correcting me on Freds name and nothing else.  Fred's proper name is
Frederick J. Schwab, CEO, PCNA.  I was told by alot of my Porsche friends
not to expect much from PCNA and that is what I got.

Anyway glad to hear you all are having a great time in you cars.  I had a
grin on my face when I got to drive a Boxster.

Bob
