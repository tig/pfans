This is in reply to Julien Nerguisian concerning his questions about radar 
detectors in France.

I've been living and driving in France for four years now. I have a 911 coupe, 
a Boxster, and  an 
Audi A6. Like Mr. Nerguisian, I thought it would be "useful" to bring a radar 
detector from the U.S.
However, after a while I came to the conclusion that it is not really 
necessary. Here's why:
   --Detectors are highly illigal here, and the Police have a very nasty 
attitude about them. Even 
     a disconnected detector can be confiscated, and very heavy fines imposed, 
if the cops see
     it for whatever reason. I've also been told that they even have the right 
to confiscate the car
     as well, although I really don't know if I believe that! The person who 
told me is French, and 
     a driving enthusiast, and he was serious, though!
   --I find that detectors are not as important here as in the U.S. anyway. In 
four years, I've only
     encountered three or four speed traps, and in every occassion I was 
warned beforehand by 
     oncoming drivers (flashing of lights) or by a general slowing-down of the 
traffic ahead of me.
     The general attitude about speed is a lot more enlightened here than back 
home.
   --While the official speed limit on highways is 130 kph (about 81 mph), 
most people routinely
     drive at up to 150 kph (93 mph) in complete safety from the police. In 
consequence, even 
     at speeds around 100 mph+, a fast driver does not "stand out from the 
crowd".

I came to France with a Whistler Spectrum 2 detector, which I used regularly 
in the car for about
six months. As I said above, the lack of "opportunities" did not allow me to 
check on its effectiv-
ness. Nowadays, most police radar here is the unmanned photo type, so a 
detector that works
with photo radar is obligatory to give any kind of protection.

My final advice would be: come, relax, and enjoy! The driving is pretty good 
if you do it outside
of the big cities (mainly Paris and its sorrounding suburbs), and avoid the 
rush hours. In fact, I
like driving in France more than in Germany. But that's another story.
