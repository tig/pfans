i feel obligated to reply simply because to me, no matter what anybody 
says, the m3 will always be a "big old sedan with a monster engine." 
(isn't that funny, me quoting somebody quoting me :-)

it's obviously an outstanding car, better than the boxster in terms of 
handling, straightline performance, and even practicality.  that doesn't 
faze me at all - the boxster holds something indescribable for me that 
the bmw never will.  admittedly it's not a rational decision (let's see, 
better performance, better practicality - why would i want a boxster?) 
but so be it.  sometimes you gotta follow your heart :-)
