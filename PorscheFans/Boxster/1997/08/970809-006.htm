Actually,  the recent strength in the dollar (vs the mark) should argue
against an increase in price, especially  since most of porsche's
manufacturing expenses are not dollar based.  Every dollar they pick up
here in sales revenue is now worth more marks.  But as has been pointed
out, there are lots of factors, including the constant rumblings that
Porsche N.A. lobbied hard for lower base prices, only to see prices in the
used car market exceed new car prices, and stay there.  It makes sense for
Porsche to believe that more of the money should end up in their pockets,
rather than in the pockets of speculators.

In addition, after being on the waiting list for two years for my Boxster,
I have a hard time working up tears for those who waited till January to
get on the list, and complain they have to wait 8 - 10 months for a car.  
My deposit for the much discussed Boxster "S"  has been in my dealer's
hands since January of this year, with delivery not scheduled until 4th qtr
of '98 at the earliest.    With increasing indication that the "S" is going
to be very limited edition, if your not in already it's most likely too 
late.  It's not just Porsche.  My wife's yellow SLK is due in this
December, 13 months after her deposit.  The E420 is  backed up 8 months.
And in most parts of the country, the waiting time for a Harley is still
ugly  (try buying one of those new for MSRP).  Perhaps the stock market
needs to drop about 20% and run alot of these folks out of the hunt.

For those who are waiting, it's worth the wait.  Course, the option is to
anty up some of the money Porsche left on the table and buy one on the
market!

Cheers, RC
