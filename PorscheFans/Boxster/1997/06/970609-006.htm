Sorry if this is a duplicate, but I sent this recently and have not seen 
it in the digest.  Maybe mine got lost.

Let me add some to the story below with some experiences in motorkhana 
requiring the use of reverse gear.  Fast selecting of reverse is more 
difficuly with the Tiptronic, since it is easy in the heat of the moment to 
find it in P or N instead of R.  I think I need something to stop the gate 
from going to P, maybe the insertion of a nylon stopper in the gate, so I can 
just push the stick forward without looking, and rely on the temporary stopper 
to align the stick with "R".  Any ideas would we welocme.

Back to the original posting...
-----------------------
 Robert wrote to the Boxster list "Any in depth explanation of how to program 
transmission for various driving situations?  I attempted to drive in 
automatic at speed on the track, but was unable to prevent early shifting.  
Thanks."

I have a 993 Tiptronic and have used it on the track ("Calder" near Melbourne, 
Australia) in both manual mode and full auto at a Porsche club event and in 
training.  I assume that the behaviour of the 993 version is similar to the 
Boxster, but have never driven a Boxster.

In manual mode, I relied on the box to perform automatic UPshifts for me, and 
I took responsibility for the DOWNshifts, basing the timing of the downshift 
on the current revs.  Of course if the speed is too high, the request is 
ignored.  Having gained some experience in manual mode, I then tried the full 
automatic.

The key is to drive the car hard enough to convince the computer that you are 
serious and have it "promote" you to level 5 of "sportiness".  This takes a 
while, but I don't know how long.  If in doubt, drive hard in manual for a 
bit, then switch over.

I observed that UPshifts would occur near to max revs in the lower gears.  The 
computer has a different rev limit for each gear, so don't be surprised if it 
doesn't go to the red line.  I think they have worked out an optimum change 
point so it drops back onto a strong part of the torque curve for the higher 
gear, abandoning the lower gear which is on the downslope of the torque curve.

DOWNshifts in auto are more interesting.  The track I was using is short 
(takes me about 74 seconds per lap), so the main straight only allowed me to 
get to about 210kph (about 130mph) before I needed hard braking for the 
(approx) 75kph (under 50mph) corner. The 993 at 210kph is in 4th (top) gear, 
and performed a DOWNshift very nicely under brakes, and a second DOWNshift 
just as I enter the corner.  VERY nicely timed THANK YOU!  Absolutely the 
right gear for the corner, setting me up for a fast exit.  I observed that it 
was very clever at avoiding gearchanges when in a corner under hard "G".  For 
most of the track, I could not fault the gear change timing.  I would LIKE to 
think I could do better, but I think I'd be kidding myself.

However, it does not take much to have the computer "demote" you to a more 
pedestrian profile.  The corner which enters the main straight at Calder is 
tricky, especially when the surface is damp, and I had a VERY "interesting" 
experience resulting in a spin between concrete walls and a lot of tyre smoke 
and even more sweat!!  No impact, I am relieved to say.  As a result, I find 
it hard to convince myself to REALLY push this corner, and the computer knows 
it!  It allocates 3rd gear at a time when 2nd would apparently be better.  
But, under damp circumstances, 3rd is probably justified, to reduce the 
available torque until out of the corner.  When the car is nearly lined up on 
exit, bravery returns and right foot pressure re-selects 2nd!

The lesson is that to be placed in an aggressive shift profile, you have to 
EARN it.  I have to work harder.  I suspect that in the hands of an 
experienced race driver (which I am not), the 74 second lap times would come 
down about 4 seconds in this car on my P-Zero tyres.

Hope this helps.  Incidentally, I am try to collect practical experiences from 
Tiptronic users with a goal of producing a "how to" article which goes beyond 
the basics in the car handbook.  Any contributions would be welcome!

Hope this helps
