I've been wanting to post the same question.  I'll share all the *rumors*
I've heard and maybe some people out there can add some solid truth to this
information.

First the picture...

7SpyS.jpg

I've been told the "S" body is not a new car, but rather just another
option that you can choose when ordering your car - like a sports package. 
Some dealers have told me it will be available for order in 4Q97 and
delivered in 1/2Q98.  Other dealers tell me to "keep dreaming" when I
mention those dates.  Porsche just plays dumb when I ask them about it.

I've been told the option will cost $6k - $8k (US currency) by most
dealers.  Another dealer told me $10k.  I have also heard that the base
MSRP for a '98 might go up a few thousand dollars, putting a stock '98
Boxster with the "S" body option at around $50k.

So, what is the "Boxster S" option?  One dealer told me the entire car is
20% larger overall, has a larger front intake, a better looking rear
spoiler, and a 3.0 liter 245 hp engine.  Another dealer told me only the
rear end is 20% wider and looks similar to the way a 911 has flared fenders
to handle the wider tires and engine cavity.  This sounds more believable
than the entire car being 20% wider.  In either case, the spy picture does
not seem to show any of these characteristics, except for the larger front
intake.

The final rumor I read is that along with the "S" body option, Porsche will
be introducing a new tiptronic (named wiptronic?).  I was told it would be
the first tiptronic with a clutch and 6 gears.  If this is really true, I'm
surprised I haven't heard more about it.

Anyway, nothing above is known to be positively true.  The dealers that
tell me this stuff swear it is true, but some of them have been all talk. 
I find it hard to believe that something that is so secret and vague could
possibly be in people's hands by the beginning of next year.  Nonetheless,
I would like to own one myself.

I would love to hear from others.
