First, sorry about the pictures.   I was unaware of the problems caused by
sending them through the digest.   Obviously it won't happen again.

I've had several questions about upgrading the stereo.   Here's what I've
learned:

The top two audio specialists for Porsche in L.A. are Rodeo Audio (1 818
888-5000)
and Paris Audio (310 477-0047).  Both are very high end shops (Ferraris,
Rolls, ect.)  and have already worked on several Boxsters.

Both agreed the factory Boxster upgrade is "decent" even "impressive".
 (Especially compared to the 911s).  Keeping in mind this is a small car with
an open top and no rear speakers - great sounds are difficult to come by.  

The two shops had somewhat different apporaches for improvement.  Paris is
replacing the Porsche amp with a 240 ADS.  It fits almost perfectly into the
exisiting front bracket.  The door speakers are replaced with 5" ADS (again
no cutting) and the ADS tweeters are used on the dash.  The 4" speakers on
the deck are replaced with Faullker (sp?) speakers. Porsche's exisiting
wiring is used.  The setup runs approx $1,100 and takes 8 hours to install.
 I heard the system.  In my opinion you get less distortion and increased
sharpness - about a 30% improvement.  The good thing is that no modificaitons
(cutting or rewiring)  are made to the car.

Rodeo is putting in a 100 watt Fuasgate (sp?) amp which (because of its size)
 requires stashing it where the changer goes.  They mount it on a board which
is put on velcro.  This major incrase in power coupled with speaker
replacement makes a big difference in sound.  Another option they give for
people like me, who do not want any modifications to the car, is putting in
two 240 ADS amps - one for the top and one for the bottom.  Larry at Rodeo
claims doing this (with no speaker repalcements or rewiring) will made a big
difference is sound quality.  I have not heard this set up.
They charge appox $1,000 for either option.  

Hope this helps.  If anyone has seen or heard about other options for
upgrading the factory stereo I'd like to hear about it.


P.S. About cleaning the back plastic window.  I found "Plexus" to be the best
product on the market.  You can get it thorugh Perforamcne Products (1 800
752-6196).  I've had great results with it.
