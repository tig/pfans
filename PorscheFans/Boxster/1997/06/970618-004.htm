Just returned to my office for one day of catching up - back to San
Antonio tomorrow for the Boxster's day at the autocross ! I'll send a
note on the times posted relative to some of the other cars that will
also be running on Thursday.
PCNA has a trio of Boxsters on display as you drive up to the Entrance
at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, one silver and two red. While a
walking tour through the parking lot and  Concours prep area was
rewarded with a large assortment of fine 356's, and 911's - the several
Boxsters present were drawing alot of questions and attention. Besides
the PCNA cars at the entrance I noted two black, three silver, one arena
red, and one red Boxsters in attendance in addtion to my speed yellow
Boxster. One of the Silver Boxsters was brought up by German Tech., Inc
a Tech Art rep out of Florida. It featured the following Tech Art pieces
- front spoiler (two piece), side rocker panels, engine intake vertical
foil ( fits in intake recess - totally- and is shaped to scoop more air
in at speed), rear wing (small boomerang or crescent shaped), 3 piece
wheels, and several interior trim items (many body colored accent
pieces). In general I liked all the exterior pieces - gave the car a
slightly more aggressive look, but I didn't think it made it look
"overdone" or "boy racer". 

Hardtop question - talking with one of the owners who had and
demonstrated the hardtop installation and removal I picked up an
interesting bit of info - if you didn't order a hardtop with your car
the necessary bracket for connection the top behind the door isn't
installed! So you can't just order a hardtop later and "drop it on". He
noted a friend had inquired about it and was told a dealer could
probably order the piece(s) necessary but would then have to remove the
body panels necessary to allow them to be welded on, and then there may
be a question as to proper alignment and fit. He also noted that the
"Speedster" style cowling that is now available as an option ('98 model)
also requires this same hard ware. Has anyone else heard this and or
talked with a dealer concerning adding the necessary bracket?

More than enough for now, I'll give my impression of the Technic Sport
package from that 1600 mile trip home and the addtional 800 miles I've
put on it since after I return from the Parade autocross tomorrow.
