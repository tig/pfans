Right out of the "box" this car is going to be a very competitive
autocross, etc. car. Boxsters were in the last group of cars that ran on
Thursday, so I didn't get the comparitive times I promised. I'll try and
get a final copy of all results to make sure I've got the numbers right.
My final run was a 1:06.9?? but I was told by a worker afterward that
I'd tipped over a cone at one of the gates - so +2secs will be added.
How does this compare? Best time posted up until the final group run on
Thursday I was told was a 1:05.8?? and that most of the 911's had not
broken below 1:07. and these were properly set up and frequently
autocrossed cars. The only change I made was putting  on a set of new
BFG R1's. Having not driven an autocross in approx 2 yrs. or a time
trial in 9 months (broke my 944 street/track car!) it wasn't my driving
that gets any credit but the cars innate ability. I'm definitly looking
forward to beginning to autocross  again and the chance to begin to
learn to drive this car :-) ! 
Enjoy the Driving!
