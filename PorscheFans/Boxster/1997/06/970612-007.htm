Prosche will be offering a new style Boxster wheel called the "Dyno".  It is
supposed to be available in August.  As with the exisitng upgrade, fronts are
17x7; rears 17x8.5.  They will cost approx. $2,200 with tires.

I'm told it looks like the present 17" Boxster wheel except each of the the
five spokes has a cut out - which makes the wheel appear as having ten
spokes.  Supposedly this give the car a radical look - very different for
Porsche.  I have not seen pictures yet. 

I will be getting pix of many Boxster goodies in the next week or so.  Jeff
Korda at Ogner Porsche (818 884-4411) reports they've been besieged with
orders for the Boxster "Boomerang".   Again, if you value you radiators give
this front bumper protection bar some thought.

Also, Barry at CEC (310 203-3900) has - after waiting three months - gotten
the 17" Speedline wheels for the Boxster.  I will have a picture of  them as
well.  I think many of you will be blown away by the look judging from the
comments for those who've seen the wheels on the Boxster in person.

One last note.  My wife and I were in Pasadena the other night.  There was a
Boxster parked on the street.   A couple comes over to a guy looking over the
car and ask what it is.  The guy knowingly explains it's one of those new
$100,000 Porsches.  The couple oohs and ahhs and walks on.  I just pass by
and smile.
