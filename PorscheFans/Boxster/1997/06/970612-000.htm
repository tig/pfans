HI.

I have a '89 944S2 and have decided it's time to get a Boxster.

I seek some advice:

1) I didn't keep the various Road&Track/Car&Driver/Pano, etc tests. What is the
practical difference betwen stock and Option 396 (17" wheels @$1450)? Is there
something like the M030 suspension package? note: I won't be tracking the car
but better handling is always better.

2) I have been told by 2 dealers that ALL 197 models are spoken for. I might
get lucky and get a car someone reneges on, but otherwise i'll have to wait for
the 1998 production -- ie wait until November possibly.

3) Is there any indication of when the more powerful engine will be introduced?


4) Are there other options I should consider?

5) Any other advice for me? How about prices??

PLEASE SEND replies to me directly. fhp@unipress.com. There seems to be a
problem getting on the Boxster list now.

Thanks,

FRED PACK
