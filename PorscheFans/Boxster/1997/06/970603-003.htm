I went through the same decision making process and finally decided on a
special order color (speed yellow) over the standard pastel yellow. =

Although I saw quite a few pics of pastel yellow and liked them, I *still=
*
preferred the speed yellow over it.  The fact that there is a speed yello=
w
C4S at my dealer's and it looks great (the paint seems so deep and shiny!=
)
didn't help the decision favor the pastel yellow, either. The other
standard colors didn't do anything for me, except for red, which I like b=
ut
everyone will have in a few years.  IMHO, silver and red will be the ones=

we'll see most, so I shied away from them (plus I don't like silver *at
all*).

Anyway, I figured if I was going to order and wait (and wait, and wait) f=
or
a car, I might as well get some distinctive options, color included.  Som=
e
of the special order colors are *really* distinctive at worst, downright
gourgeous at best.  Hmm..I seem to remember someone from the list orderin=
g
Green w/ beige interiors? Pretty awesome.

Now, for useful info as opposed to my personal rants about taste in color=

<g> :

You will find two pics of pastel yellow (as well as most of the standard
colors) at the Scottsdale site: www.scottsdalejag.com
The Porsche USA site has a couple of pastel yellows in the 'Arizona' part=

of the Boxster section: www.porsche.com
The Cable channel (discovery channel) ran a special, narrated by Jay Leno=
,
called 'Fast Cars' (or something to that effect) two days ago.  It focuse=
d
on the 993 Turbo, Ferrari F50 and Callaway 'Vette (?!) but there was a
Turquoise Blue 986 that showed up in a couple of scenes.  I liked the way=

it looked, but the color was too similar to my wife's '96 Caravan for me =
to
actually consider buying it.
There is a web page (Berkeley's Boxter page) that has some great links to=

different color boxster pics but I can't remember the address offhand.

Well, that's it! I hope I helped...

OOOhh! Nice! Here's a novel idea:Get your Boxster in the same color as yo=
ur
356.  Wouldn't *that* be kinda cool?
