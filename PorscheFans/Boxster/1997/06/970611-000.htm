THANKS to the guys in Chicago who tipped me off through PorscheFans I'm
now the owner of a Speed Yellow Boxster with Technics Sport pkg + 6
months ahead of schedule! 
Several weeks ago I went to the dealership to pick up some parts and sat
down with the manager to visit on several things, one being the Boxster.
I spec'd out  Speed yellow, technic pkg, CD, cruise control. Asked him
to fax me the quote sheet with a note concerning delivery estimate.
While waiting to get this fax I subscribed to the Boxster list (I've
been on the 911 list) to start gleaning info from current and soon to be
owners. Imagine my surprise when two days later I read the note the guys
from Chicago wrote about picking up a red Boxster in Indianapolis - and
there were two more on the lot, one was Speed Yellow w/Technic pkg !
That same day I get the fax from the dealer pricing the car I'd
requested, with a note that it would be a '98 with an estimated delivery
mid-winter/early spring and probably a  3 - 6% price increase. Decision
time! Pay a "expediting" fee to have my car now or go through the
gestation period of 6 - 9 months ! A beautiful weekend helped me make an
easy decision, and Monday morning I e-mailed the dealer to hold the car,
I'm on my way!
I'll send a note concerning my 3 - day 1600 mile return trip impression
of the car, particularly the Technic pkg, soon! Thanks again, Chicago!
