I have a C4 with factory standard sound which sounds terrible (but I don't
seem to care much in the 911). I have had a 944T with a seriously upgraded
(~$3000) sound system (Nakamichi head & amps, Boston acoustic spkrs, custom
bass enclosure, ...) that sounded pretty good.

The boxster upgraded system sounds great. Lots of solid musical bass
(without whump whump whump) and very clear mids from the front dash two-way
spkrs. The only shortcoming is with the ergonomics of the Becker head unit.
It has some bells and whistles (e.g. station finding, multi-memories per
button, volume increases tied to speed). But it is pretty clumsy to use
since all the buttons look alike yet assume different personalities based
on current function and a sort of shift function key.

Net net: the upgraded sound package is very good and I enjoy its
musicality. I woudln't think an aftermarket shop could beat it for the
money.
