Give your name and number to all dealers in your area for cancellations.
I did and got my car 7 days after putting in an order!  I have since
received three calls for cancelled orders that are up for grabs in the
NYC area.

Picked up the car on Thursday and now have 300 miles.  First impressions
are that the car is everything I thought it would be.  Handles like a
dream.  Interior space is small but not a problem - just have not
figured out where to put things.  Have had no problems with the car as
of yet (knock on wood).  Still pondering the extended warranty which
seems pretty good.  So far I like the pricing on the Warranty Gold the
best but am VERY reluctant to do business with an "internet only
company."  Would welcome any comments from people who have delt with
them or any other warranty provider.

One thing that I have found a bit annoying is that my floor mats have
two clips to attacht them to the tracks under the seats.  This is a
great idea to keep it from moving around.  However, with the clips
engaged, the plastic piece that covers the tracks can not be replaced.
I would have thought that German engineers could have done better.

Also, be careful with the plastic caps that snap onto the two guides for
the convertible top (they fit into the top of the windshield).  I took
my car for a spin around the block upon delivery and found that it got
stuck in the windshield until a bump knocked it loose and into my lap.
It could have ended up on the street.

That's all for now...got to go drive.
