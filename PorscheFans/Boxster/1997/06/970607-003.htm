I asked the dealer if he had any info on the allocation of Boxsters, and why you might be seeing so many.  I 
appears that boxster allocation was based on 911 sales in 1996, 1 for 1. So in the Pacific Northwest the 
allocation was:

MCL 		 80 (Canada's largest dealer)
Barrier 		52
Speedway 	  7

Further, here in Alberta:
Calgary 19
Edmonton 12

Manitoba 4
Ontario 165 
Quebec 85
(Source 1996 area Manager's report)

97 986/P38 On the water...
