So my car arrived on Saturday and I took delivery of it yesterday. So far 
I love it although it is _really_ hard to keep the revs under 4200 RPM as 
specified in the manual for the break-in period! I've only got a little 
over 100 miles on the car but I'll try to give you some of my impressions 
so far.

My car is an Ocean Blue Metallic 5 speed with the Sport Touring Package, 
Graphite Grey standard interior and traction control. I didn't spec the 
car but rather took the first one that became available. If you are in 
line and haven't seen your car on a computer printout yet, be sure not to 
pass up any cars that are offered to you in the meantime. The car I 
specified is scheduled to be built in Dec and I ordered it in early Jan. 
If you don't have a firm date yet expect your car to be built after that. 
Normally I would not have spec'ed the Sport Touring Package as I don't 
feel the various chrome things add up to the difference in cost above the 
standard sports package, but having a car now is much better than 
waiting. I like the chrome shifter, brake lever and rollbars but the 
chrome gauges are a bit hard to read in twilight conditions. This isn't a 
huge problem though because of the digital speedo.

The car handles really, really well. I'm very impressed so far. 
Acceleration is OK and I suspect will be much better once I get over the 
break-in and can start revving the engine properly. The car is very quiet 
on the highway, noticeably quieter than my previous car - a 94 Integra 
GSR. For such a great handling car it also has good highway manners. 
Brakes are downright awesome. Compared to my Integra the shifter has long 
throws and is a bit notchy. On the other hand the lever requires less 
effort to move and seems more precise. The clutch grabs a bit high but is 
pretty forgiving once you get used to it. I stalled it twice driving away 
from the dealership but I haven't had a problem since then. The trip 
computer is a very cool toy and is a nice thing to have if you are 
planning to do long trips. It measures gas mileage, range on remaining 
fuel, has a speed alarm and can tell you the outside temperature.

I do have a few complaints so far, but they are rather minor. I wish I 
could get rid of the stupid center console. It really gets in the way of 
my right leg. I'm hoping I'll get used to it. I'm driving down to San 
Diego this weekend so I'll report back on whether I ended up with bruises 
or not. Also, the cupholders are a complete joke. They fit in the air 
vents on the left and right side of the car. They are difficult to 
install when the car is sitting still and probably impossible at speed. 
The also block the air vents. Oh well, can't have everything. It would 
also be nice if the steering wheel was more adjustable. I'm not 
particularly tall and I have to lean the seat back a bit to be able to 
see the top of the tach under the wheel. 

The standard interior isn't as ugly as its reputation but it is rather 
plain for such an expensive car. I'm looking into after market solutions. 
Anybody have any recommendations?

Well that's it for now. I'll be back later with more as I get to know the 
car.
