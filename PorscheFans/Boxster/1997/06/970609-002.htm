<<This morning, after spending
12 hours parked in my flat, air conditioned garage, it blew out a huge
cloud of blue smoke.  It's service department bound, but I was wondering
if anybody else has seen this kind of behavior, and if the preliminary
answer makes any sense to those guys who have owned a 911.

I too have had this occur about once a month.  It happens while sitting in
the garage overnight.  My 911 did it before and after a rebuild and much more
frequently.  I was told by the service department that it was a boxer thing.
 I only half believe them.  Keep us posted.
