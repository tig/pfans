I just sat through a 317 page download of todays Boxster digest.

For one, and many of you have been through this before here; someone sent
pictures to this text based listserv.
Sure some folks see them okay, but most don't.  Those pictures just turn into
hundreds of pages of useless text.
Again, we've been through it before - the rule is DON'T SEND PICTURES.
If you have a snapshot to share, post a URL where it can be accessed
separately or send the damn thing as an attached file directly to an EMail
address.

For two; someone thought enough to comment on a message within the previous
days' digest, clipping the ENTIRE first one in the process.

I don't make the rules here, I'm not the thought police, and I don't have a
bug up my.....  as I've been told.
I do subscribe, and contribute, and my perspective is as valid as anyone
elses.
This is not a personal thing, just a matter of efficiency.

It is a WASTE OF BANDWIDTH to clutter a text based listserv with material
only a few can access, as well clipping part or parts (or the entire thing)
of messages just to make a comment, reaction, or continuation of the
'thread'.  "Me Too" messages are likewise wasteful.
Just clip the bit you need, keep it brief, and refrain from filling the pipe
with crap.

No need to start a topic regarding this information.  No need to comment or
respond.
Just learn the lesson well.  Thanks.
