The May issue of Christophorous has a very good article about the advantages
of the tiptronic (in this case the 4-speed tip on the Carrera S).   "Scarcely
any Porsche driver... can shift a six speed gearbox as perfectly as the
Tiptronic S manages automatically every time with its four gears (keep in
mind the Boxtser's five-speed tip is far improved over this one).  

They also make the important point that "the more you get used to driving
with the tip, the less often do your thumbs use the shift buttons on the
steering wheel."   A really experienced tip driver uses the throttle to
shift.  My guess is most poeple who don't like this transmission have no idea
how to dirve it.

After spending five months with my car there is no way I'd order anything but
the tip. 

Also, I visited a Porsche body shop today and saw a Boxster with front end
damage from a low-speed hit.  There are several key componants (including the
radiators) right behind the front bumper.

The body shop manager took a look at my Boxster "Boomerang" and said that
Porsche should have made this standard equipment.  As you may not know, the
bumper is just plastic offering almost no protection.   This steel bar gives
the front end much needed protection and added stiffness.  After seeing
front-end damage I hope that all Boxters owners take a look at this
inexpensive option.

I will have pictures of the "Boomerang" and many other  Boxster options
(including metal pedals, wheels, replacements for the ugly black rear-end
bumper guards, exhausts, steering wheels, etc.)  in the next few weeks.  All
these items are equal to - or exceed - Porchse factory quality.  Again, if
you need info on this before then call Jeff Korda at Ogner Porsche at 818
884-4411.  I believe there is a toll free number for Ogner that was listed
recently on this board.
