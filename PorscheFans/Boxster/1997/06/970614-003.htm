	John, I think Larry must be having some trouble with his
	mail or something. He hasn't been answering my mail, either,
	so it's not just you. Still, if I were you, I'd give him the
	benefit of the doubt. Here's his phone number: 201-796-8300
	Give him a ring and see what he says. He carries all the stuff
	that he talks about in his article so you can order it all
	through My orders have always arrived very promptly by the way.
	Good luck!
