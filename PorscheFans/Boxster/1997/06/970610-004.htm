<< 
 My baby has taken to spitting out alot of blue smoke when started up
 after sitting 8 hours or so. .... This morning, after spending
 12 hours parked in my flat, air conditioned garage, it blew out a huge
 cloud of blue smoke.  It's service department bound, but I was wondering
 if anybody else has seen this kind of behavior, and if the preliminary
 answer makes any sense to those guys who have owned a 911.
 
 Cheers, RC  >>

By God the Boxster is a true Porsche!

Both of my 911s would smoke if parked them without getting the engine fully
hot.  They would have to run for at least 10 miles otherwise next time I'd
start it - clouds of smoke everywhere.  Really quite a sight if all you did
prior to starting was to jockey them around a bit.
