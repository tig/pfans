removal of the "Boxster" name?>>

I took my Boxster script off with nothing but a foam type glass cleaner.
 That is how the dealer said to do it.  Use a thin plastic credit card
(Blockbuster card) to work under the tape.  You will find that the plastic
Boxster will come off very easily and will leave a foam, rubbery tape.  It
will also come off.  U may see the outline after removal. This too will come
off.  I replaced the script with a like script in chrome.  Looks better on a
Black car.
