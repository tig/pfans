Kerry (and other interested Boxster owners):

According to Paul Schiemer, who I believe first brought up the subject in
Porschefans some time ago, the CDX-T62 is supposed to be the right Sony
model (though it's second-hand info for him too, don't blame him!). The new
10-disc units apparently don't use the same protocol. I haven't been able
to confirm this, but I haven't pursued it too far yet, as my car doesn't
arrive for another couple of weeks. I did find the CDX-T62 in the
Crutchfield catalog, called them, and they told me that it was still in
production, though back-ordered. Its a risk though to order it without
confirmation that it really will work.

One other alternative is an audio shop in New Jersey that carries the
Becker changer unit for about $600US, a $200 savings over getting it from
porsche. Don't have their name or number offhand, but they have an ad in
the back of the latest Excellence magazine. Might be a good bet. At least
it's guaranteed to work with your unit.

I also would like to hear from anyone who even knows someone who has
actually gone through trying the Sony unit, even if they found out it
doesn't work. At least we can put the rumor to rest.

Hope this helps, and let me know what you find out!

-Phil.
