Hello Boxster List:  couldn't resist correcting the bad info 
regarding adding a Hard top to the Boxster.  Please refer to pages 87 
to 89 in the Owner's manual.  Picture 2 on page 87 shows the removal 
of the plastic cap over the pivot locks.  On cars that came without a 
hard top (like mine) when you remove the cap you will find an empty 
space.  This space is missing the bearing which captures the pivot 
pins (bayonet catch fittings) from the hard top.  NO PROBLEM.  Refer 
to pages 6-22 to 6-25 of the Service Information Technik.  Especially 
refer to picture A-2 at top of page 6-25 - this shows what the 
hardtop equipped car looks like with the bearing installed.  This is 
a damn simple installation.  First order the bearings - they are 
available from the parts department now.  They are part #s 986 563 
714 02 (right side) and 986 563 713 02 (left side).  They cost $53.  
I  know because I purchased and installed them.  And yeah the 
installation takes about 2 minutes - you just push them into the 
bearing carrier being sure to align the bearing as shown in picture 
A-2.  Anyone who says otherwise don't know what they are talking 
about because I've "been there and done that" already.  Cars already 
have wiring in place to hook up the rear defogger.  Any dealer who 
charges more than $10 bucks for this "installation" is robbing you 
and someone who talks about welding, etc. is either full of sh*t or a 
serious fraud. Once the bearings are in place your car is ready for 
the hardtop.   Oh, about getting the hardtop.  Still not available 
as a finished piece from Porsche parts.  However, Paul Householder at 
Champion Porsche in Pompano Beach, FL was able to get his customer to 
add my hardtop to her car.  I paid the sticker cost for the hardtop 
plus shipping to Boston.  Another thing that Paul got for me was the 
zipper storage compartment that goes under the roll bar.  My car came 
with a cargo net only.  Paul says all the later cars come with the 
storage compartment.  Paul wrote Reno and asked Sue Gerdes to send me 
the storage compartment.  PCNA sends it to my office at NO CHARGE.  I 
still say you can't beat the service at Champion, especially if you 
deal with Paul Householder.  My car just passed 7,500 miles and I 
have had absolutely no problems since the initial computer problem 
with "check engine light."  Regards.  William Harris
