Trying to keep my mileage low, I am at 600 miles one month later.  A
friend of mine who renovates the 356 model tells me one of the more rare
356's is the few that were made in Belgium.  If any of you have seen the
show on performance cars on the Discovery channel (mostly Ferrari
oriented), you would have seen the method Porsche uses to keep down the
price is mass production.  All the vehicles are on an assembly line and
cranked out.  In fact my car came in about three weeks earlier than
predicted. Just because the Germans don't screw it together doesn't
necessarily mean it won't hold value or it will fall apart... not unlike
the American made Japanese cars.... hmmmm.
Have any of you experienced the airbag light sticking on. My wife
adjusted her seat last weekend and the airbag went on and has stayed on
ever since. The manual says to go to the dealer but I would like to
avoid it if possible.  Once in the dealer's hands, the perfect machine
will become less perfect.  Any other folks experience this problem?
Finally, I have had a couple of responses to my request for a hardtop
storage device. Any of you have hands on experience or recommendations?
