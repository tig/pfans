I took delivery of my Artic Silver, black leather 986 on Thursday.
Awesome. I find myself not being sufficiently responsible to keep the
revs back. It's so much fun to rev it up. There is some disagreement I
guess about a "break-in period" although the owner's manual suggests
keeping it under 4200 for 1000 miles or so. It's hard to hold this car
back it wants to go. I stalled at the dealership as I prepared to leave
and truly impressed them with my shifting prowess. This was my first tip
not to baby the car.
All that was delivered as promised came through except I ordered it
without the model dsignation. Porsche sent it through with. Now I think
I am "stuck" with it as the glue may damage the finish. Any thoughts on
removal of the "Boxster" name?
I love it. It's fun, holds the road unlike anything I have ever driven.
Now if I can avoid wrapping myself around the trees or hitting a wayward
pedestrian, I'll be in good shape.
As you may all be aware, I am obsessed by this extended warranty thing.
The selling dealer (source of auto) sells CNA insurance since Jan 97.
Says experience to date is good. Prior extended service contract was
with GE CAPITAL. Says their experience was bad. My local dealer which
will be servicing the car insists they will not accept any insurance
that they did not sell me. They say I must buy it from them. GE CAP
confirms some dealers do this even though they are not supposed to. What
to do what to do?  I have enough headaches with my HMO I don't need car
insurance headaches too.
QUESTIONS:
1) I live in PA. Does anybody have thoughts on the best fuel to put in
it. Manuals suggest 95 octane; we seem to have only 93 except for Sunoco
which I believe offers 98. Thoughts, suggestions?
2) Need a storage place for the hardtop. Dolly or block and tackle
suspesnion? Are either made for the Boxster specifically yet?

A final word, this vehicle is beautiful, fast, responsive, fun and
addictive. Waitees wait; it's worth the wait. Also, the car is beautiful
with the hardtop, lines are sleak and I prefer it to the softtop up.
Each to his own. Prefered mode, top down, sun high in the sky and 147
mph.
