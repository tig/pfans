Hey dudes,

Does anyone know the distribution of Boxsters around the world?  Reason I ask
is that there are soooo many Boxsters around B.C. in Canada that I'm curious
if there is anywhere else in the world that can top the number of these cars
around here.  On a decent commute from home to downtown Vancouver, you will
likely see 3-4 Boxsters.  What is somewhat unusual about this is that it
rains out here quite frequently.  We also seem to have an abnormaly high
count of Porsches in general.  You hardly see many Porsches for sale at
dealers, etc. since they get snapped up as soon as they show up (if they
are clean and nice).  We seem to have tons and tons of C4S's and twin turbos
running around.  The impression I get is that the narrow body 993 didn't do
as well here as the wide body versions did.

Any info?
