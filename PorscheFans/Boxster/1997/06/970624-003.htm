Ran the Boxster at Sebring Track Sunday.  It ran great. I have revised my
tire pressures from the first event at Roebling. I am running R1's on after
market rims.  The pressures I finalized were with the help of a tire temp
gauge.  I was able to get them even all the way across.  The final pressures
were, Fronts, 24.5 and Rears, 28.5 psi, cold. The car ran great but I did
spin on the first lap and learned that 986 and 911 do not have the same spin
characteristics.  The 911 spins with the back going around to meet the front.
 On the 986, it spins on the center as a pivot.  Very interesting.  My times
were 2:45-2:46.  I am not sure if these times are good or bad.  I used my new
trailer hitch to tow my track tires and needed tools to the track.  It works
great! 
the handling was very predictable, and a real joy to drive with very little
effort. The only handling problem I had was on turn 7, a 2nd gear slow turn
of 120 degrees.  The car would not be settled and as I gave it the gas it
would hop at the rear wheels.  I had the TC off. I do have a question for the
Boxster fans. " Should one drive with the TC on of Off while at a track
event?" And why??
