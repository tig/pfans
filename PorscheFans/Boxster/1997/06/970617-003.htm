Greetings all,

The baby is still in the shop, they are working to get the soft top
cover to lay down just so when the top is reclined.  It aligns fine with
the top up, but put the top down and the cover sticks up, unevenly,
around the back.  Did not realize how bad it was till I saw another
boxster at the proschefest in May, and realized it is supposed to be
flat and even.

As for the smoke (a real Porsche indeed Mark!) it's been overnight at
the dealer, some smoke at startup but not as much as I've experienced at
home.  They are going to hold on to it a few more nights, (I'm out of
town anyway), and see if they can get a better handle on it.  They think
the smoking they have seen is not too bad, but are checking with the
regional rep to get another viewpoint.  While it's in, I having them
change fluids and filters, got just shy of 5,000 miles and want to make
sure it's protected.  Had them install the boomerang, parts guy liked
it, may stock some himself.  Once I get another update on the oil smoke
I'll pass it along.

Cheers, RC
