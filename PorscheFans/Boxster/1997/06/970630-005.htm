Hello all,
Finally got the chance to run my Boxster in the autocross event. My =
advise, if you never done any competitive driving, go and try it. This =
is THE way you can have fun in your car without breaking any laws. =
Boxster is truly amazing car. I've never participated in any kind of =
competitive driving myself, but in the Boxster I was able to finish with =
very reasonable results. Here are few comments I would like to make. =
First of all tires. I don't think I am going to race my car with street =
tires any more. They are expensive, they wear out really fast and the =
don't give as much grip as R1. So I am looking for an advice from some =
one who raced Boxster on the wheel/tire combination to use on my car for =
autocross. Currently I have 17" rims with P Zero tires, but I was =
thinking about going to16" for racing, I've being told, that I can get =
more torque if I go with smaller tires, which makes sense.  The second =
comment is about traction control. I found it to be a mixed blessing. On =
one hand it gets on the way in the turn, especially, when you are trying =
to exit one.  On the other hand I was saved by it when it stopped my car =
from doing 360. I've started losing control of my car, and I felt slight =
decrease in the acceleration and saw TC light to come up on the dash. =
Next time I ran the course I had TC off, and sure enough I made a donut. =
