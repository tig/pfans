Mine came with no instructions as well, according to my parts guy, the
sponge is used to remove the wax on the door sills before you apply the
metal sill.

Yes, drilling is required. The instructions clearly warn you to be very
carefull.  You have to drill holes in the car to mount the boomerang,
(the boomerang comes pre-drilled), and some of the holes have to be
drilled directly under the radiators and associated piping.  The
instructions recommend you put tape on your drill bit to prevent you
from drilling too far into the car.  Good luck.

I'm lucky, have an early boxster with more discrete labels.  Has anybody
spent the bucks to get the matching leather sun visors, and if so, what
did the labels look like on those?

It's been raining and cool in NC for the last week.
