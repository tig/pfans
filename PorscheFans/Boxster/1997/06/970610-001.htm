M Christopher Gilfond wrote and asked about car care products.  Surely, many
products have their loyal adherents, but two groups of products seem most
commonly recommended- ZYM"oL and P21S.  Each of these product lines sell
washes, waxes, cleaners ( pre-waxing) and various other cleaners for
interiors,glass,etc.    
 <A HREF="http://www.zymol.com/">ZYMOL</A> has a web site (just click the
Hypertext) the URL is http://www.zymol.com       John Paterek is PCA's
Technical Committee member for Body/Paint/Upholstery/Interiors.  He has used
and recommended P21S wax and Paintwork Cleanser. P21S is Porsche's authorized
wheel care product. Automotion and Performance Products are both on the Web
and carry these products.

      I don't know as much about leather care as I'd like.  Cleaning,
nourishing, and protecting (particularly from UV) leather are still vague for
me. Zymol, Lexol, and Connolly all make products I've seen used by concours
types.  Porsche also used to have car care chemicals available, but may no
longer be exporting them to the US.

     One of my concerns is keeping the auto glass clean and like new.  I love
Rain-X. Here in the Pacific Northwest we get frequent showers, and with
Rain-X  I usually don't even need to use my wipers.

      My dealer waxed and detailed my car prior to delivery, and I believe
that is a Porsche dealer prep standard.  It certainly ought to be.

     I think preserving the car is just as important as cleaning the car.  I
got a good UV- shielding cover for my car for times I cannot garage my car.
 At least get a reflector to protect the dash from sunlight through the
windshield. Car "bras" are OK for some situations, too.
   
     Hope any of this helps...      Jesse
