O.K.  I've had the center console out several times to work on cell
phone, radar, sound, etc. Anyone want a 'look see' all you do is pull
off one of two snap-in carpet panals(one on the back left, and one on 
back right) of the center console. Leather covered panals to the front
of each pop off too but thats not nec. for just look. They pull out &
then forward. You will not have trouble putting them back.  You'll then
see:        Frame work to support console, dash, etc.
            Electical, Air bag brain-box + misc. wiring
            Carpet is pretty cut up to accomodate the above
I know some of the old pictures show no console but does anyone know if 
the car is actually delivered that way, anywhere? I just assumed it was
a casualty (or "refinement") that occurred along the way in bringing the 
car to (the U.S.) market.               Gregg
