Christopher,

I have the hardtop and I highly recommend it. It is very well made, and
looks great on the car. The sound level cruising is about the same as
the soft top, but much lower when the trucks pass. Maked he feel more
comfortable. The interior of the hardtop is very well done and
harmonized with the interior very well.

It is removed and installed very quickly and easily, BUT it is a two man
job! I have putting it on whenever rain is predicted and leaving on
until the rain is gone. That has been days for me here in KY.

I have been looking into storage options. Mercedes has a carrier for the
SL's top and the Porsche dealer here in KY had two with Boxster hardtops
on them. They work, and cost roughly $250. Porsche has a carrier due for
release in August, that will be specifically for the Boxster's top.  I
have also heard that it will double as a tire storage rack, for the
winter/summer tire switcher out there.

You might want to call the Porsche dealer in Louisville, KY , Bluegrass
Motorsport, to see if they want to sell one of thre silver hardtops.
They have five "used" Boxsters each with 30-100 miles and priced $10,000
above list!  They bought them at auction!

Also, I have been told that if you do not/did not get a top with the car
you will not be able to get one (from Porsche) for a few years. 

JOHN

P.S. I never heard from you after I since you that last e-mail!
