Regarding the post about TechArt not being responsive to E-mail.... I live in
L.A. where TechArt is represented by CEC (Claus Ettensberger Corporation).
 They carry the complete TechArt line from Boxster wheels to areo-kits.  Call
1 800 766-0064 or 310 767-1111.  Ask for Barry, at the showroom - he's a
great guy and really knows Porsches.

I've seen many of TechArt's options for the Boxster - some are terrific (like
the sterring wheel and dials), others are a bit overdone for my taste (re:
the body kit), and still others make a bold statement (3-piece wheels: 17x8.5
front ,17x10).

About the child seats which I reported would be out this week... I got a call
from Porsche today saying trhat the feds are requiring additonal tests on the
adaptor (the seats are already in the US).  This means a mid-July launch.  I
hope it won't be any longer - my five year old and wife are ready to kill me.

One last thing - I'm getting anywhere from two to six requests a day for the
Boxster "Boomerang" - the stainless steel protective bar for the front
bumper.  I do not sell them.  Rather, I'm just passing along information on
what I consider to be a must-have option (I've already had three thank you
notes from grateful ProscheFans folks who've installed it).  Please call
Ogner Porshce at 818 884-4411 and ask for Jeff Korda, ace Porsche mechanic.
 He's got all the details. 

One last question - has anyone seen any other aftermarket wheels on the
Boxster beside Speedlines and Gemballas?  If so, I like to hear opinions...
