Trying to keep my milage low? !!!!!! Not trying to "start anything" here
but then why did you buy this car ? If you wanted an "investment" to sit
in the garage and be pretty you would have been well advised to have
searched out a 356 Speedster or other special low volume Porsche for
your $50 k . This will definitly not be that kind of car ! 5000 cars
first year, going to 10,000, with two factories assembling is not a low
volume specialty Porsche! This is a car Porsche is building to do just
the opposite ! Get it into the hands of more people so that they can
have the experience of DRIVING a well crafted, balanced performance car,
to draw them into the fold, to enlarge the following, and the related
sales of the full line of cars. 
At the Porsche Parade Concours Banquet Monday night, Fred Schwab, CEO
PCNA eluded to this fact in his speech (after showing a film called "A
Love Story" which was about re-establishing a "love affair" with a car
- of course the Boxster was the car/star) when he noted that sells of
the 993 (re - 911) had again set a new record for sells since the
Boxster had appeared in the dealers show room ! Increased traffic,
increased interest in the Marque! 
Put the top down, fill the tank up, go find an interesting road without
a lot of traffic and  visual commerical garbage (re buildings and
billboards) and just drive the car! It's alot more fun than lifting of
that cover just to look at it sitting in the garage!
To steal an appropriate line from Nissan "Enjoy the Ride"
