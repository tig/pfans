I'm trying to get a hard top for my Silver Boxster. Shouldn't be a big
hassle, right? I didn't think so. I've actually got a line on a top. The
problem I'm having is with the parts required to use it. Looking
somewhat superficially at my car, I can see that there are two plastic
inserts pushed into receptacles, one on either side of the car. As best
I can determine from the fiche in the parts department, there's a
sleeve-type thing that inserts into receptacles. The back pins of the
hard top then go into whatever fits in the two holes I've got. I fasten
it in the front just like the soft top. Does that make sense??

OK, so why is the dealer telling me it's going to take 4 hours of labor
to remove these parts???  Looks to me like there's just a couple of nuts
to loosen and slide the inserts out of the receptacles out of the car
and put the plastic inserts back in.

Can anyone shed some light on EXACTLY what I need in addition to the top
itself and how to remove it from a car that currently has it to put into
a car that doesn't?

Thanks in advance.
