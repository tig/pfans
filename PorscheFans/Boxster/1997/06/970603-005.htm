I also had the unfortunate opportunity to use the roadside service.  My
car went down while at a concert in SC.  The car wouldn't start when it
was time to leave.  The car had to be towed a fair distance--safely.
Porsche offered towing, hotel reimbursement and up to 1000 dollars for
rental car since I was over 100 miles from home.

Turns out the engine had to be replaced because Porsche wanted to
examine it in toto.
Still haven't heard exactly what it was but the service department
thinks it was a connecting rod or camshaft problem.  I commend Porsche
for not allowing the dealer to break into the engine.  They also
expressed the engine  to the shop at their cost of $800. and had my car
ready to go in a week.  So far all is well.
Hopefully my experience is a one of a kind - the car had only 250 miles
on it and had been driven quite conservatively.  Maybe I should drive it
a little harder from now on???!!
