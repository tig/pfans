Fellow Boxster onwers,

	My car's first machanical problem has appeared. The driver's side low
beamis out. The bulb lights very dimly lit. It and the left are the same
brightness when the "parking" lights are switched on, but when I turn on
the low beams, the driver's side stays very dim and the passenger's side
increases to normal low beam brightness.  The bulb looks OK on visual
inspection and the fuse in not blown.  It seems like this must be a
problem in a relay. Anyone comments, or similiar experiences?

	 I made a mistke tonight, BUT there no longer are airbag warning labels
on the sunvisors. I got the passenger's side off with Acetone and
Alcohol, but it dulled the plastic. Actually took off some of the
finish. I got it to look good with Zymol Leather/Vinyl treatment and
lots of buffing. I started on the Driver's side, which came off with
denatured alcohol, but left the glue. I did not want to use acetone. I
found where WD-40 will take off "adhesives" and it did. BUT, it oiled
the hinge or I somehow broke something in the hinge so now the door for
the mirror will not stay shut. It falls open when the visor it all the
way forward and will not stay open when trying to use the mirror.  If I
knew exactly how the thing was made and where the "spring" was I could
possibly fix it, but I looked and looked and could not find a solution.
I may "velco" the thing, but that only solves the staying closed, not
the staying open problem!  I may have to order a new one!  Anyone have a
suggestion, or know the details of the construction and function of the
sunvisor door? How does the "spring" work? Would oiling it prevent it
from holding the door in place, or is something likely to be broken?

	NOTE: When taking the headlight assembly out I noted that many of the
parts have serial numbers beginning with "996". 

	My break-in period is nearing its end (918 miles, so far). For the
first time, I took the engine above 5000 rpm today! The car continues to
impress me!   


JOHN
