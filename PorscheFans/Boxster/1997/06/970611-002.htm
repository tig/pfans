E-mail to Larry?   If you want to wait!!

 You can send them like I have, and wait. I still had not heard back
from him or "carcaresp@aol.com". It has been two months since I sent my
first note.  I have sent two addition notes. I wonder, if you are not
ordering items, does he not want to respond to e-mails. I do not
understand why I have not gotten a rely to at least one of my e-mails.


Below is the last note I sent. If any of you can help me with the
questions I would greatly appreciate it.

Larry,

I have noted our posts on both BMW and Porsche Boards. I need advice and
products to clean and maintain the soft top on my new Boxster and the
canvas top on my BMW 318ti California.

I read your document "CARE AND FEEDING OF CABRIO TOPS" off the
Sacremento PCA page, but have been unable to find any in the porducts of
which you spoke. I even looked in Performance Products and Automotion,
and they do not stock any Cabrio top care products.

Can I order them throuch you?

Thanks,
