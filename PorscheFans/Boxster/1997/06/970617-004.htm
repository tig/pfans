Christopher,

Don't have my owners manual in front of me, (car in shop), but I
remember the offical break in period being 1400 -1500 miles.  Has it
changed since the early editions?  I'll check on Thursday when I get
mine back.

As for the flex, while it's the tightest roadster I've ever been in, (my
wife claims her SLK is better, even with the top down), there is some
flex to be had, especially over harsh bumps.  How much is too much?  Not
sure, but don't expect a rock solid feel on the west side highway!!

cheers, RC
