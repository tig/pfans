>>Is anyone special-ordering
a color?

Jude,
I have a Speed Yellow (50V9) Boxster on order with a grey =

interior.  I have no idea what it will look like, since
I haven't seen one yet, but I did mess around with =

PhotoDeluxe and some pics to get a general feel for this =

shade of yellow.  I also considered green w/ beige interior, =

which I think will look sharp.  If there was the option of a beige soft t=
op
(like the z3's) green/beige would be a winning combo. Alas,
only black is available at this time.

Yesterday I saw a  boxster with a silver exterior and  red leather
 interior & aluminum gauges and shift/brake.  The interior is awesome.

I've also seen white, red, ocean blue and black in 3d. My personal opinio=
n:
White- looks real good with hardtop or with top stowed.  Looks kinda chea=
p
with the soft top up. (It reminds me of the first Miata I saw a few years=

back)
Guards Red- Awesome any way you look at it.
Ocean Blue and black-  Neither is for me.

If you want to see some other colors, try:
