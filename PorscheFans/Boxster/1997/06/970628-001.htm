Join the crowd.  A local hi fi shop assured me that they knew the model
and cable needed, had both in stock, and could do the job quickly.  They
even showed me a glossy folder from a cable manufacturer that shows
which changer and cable combo was required for all factory radios. 
(this folder showed only the Porsche Data cable would work with the
factory radio and the sony CDX changer)  It turned out to be a horror
story, mostly with problems from this shop.  However, they were unable
to get the sony disk changer to work with the upgraded radio.  The
manager called me up, told me that the factory radios now require a
"chip" that can be purchased (from them) for $165, that will make the
sony changer fully compatable.  Since they were unable/unwilling to
assure me that Porsche would not void the warranty if they took the
radio apart to install the chip, so I told them to get lost.  If you
find the magic answer let us all know.
