>>>>I've read numerous comments on the rag top not staying in the drivers
side gutter.  Mine has done this since day one.  It comes out just
behind the first joint, over the window.  The service dept. Tightened a
cable??? But doesn't seem to have solved the problem.  <<<<<<<

Anyone out there with suggestions??

Two things that will make that happen. 1) On the inside of the car over the
back top of the window is a small elastic strip with a plastic pin fixed on
it.  This pin should be in a plastic female receiver.  Look at the other side
for reference. Mine kept coming out and causing the same problem.  Solution,
put a drop of trim adhesive or rubber cement on the pin and insert in back in
the receiver.  2) The dealer also took the gutters and somehow pulled them
out further so that there is more room between the fabric and gutter.  Good
Luck
