     I recently installed the Bell remote radar ..
     It was a bit of a challenge ..
     But its in place and out of site..
     It has the option to go to a click instead of a continuous beep . 
     ( this I like ) .
     plus its cheep .. 165 dollars from any of the new York stores that 
     advertise in the back of car mags ...
     a lot cheaper than circuit city etc. .
     
     It fits in the Front Side Grill with a bit of a Squeeze , A whole was 
     drilled through the plastic and fed through a rubber grommet to the 
     front trunk ,another small whole was drilled on a plastic shield that 
     leads down to the fuse box . Looks tidy and hidden .
     
     Works well ..
     
     I believe that when police see a detector on the dash after they pull 
     you over they feel you are trying to beat the system .. Ticket time .
     Hopefully I wont be getting pulled over .
     
     Regards Mark Stocker .
