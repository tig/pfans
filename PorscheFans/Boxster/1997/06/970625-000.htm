Hi there:

I am getting ready to place my order for the 986.  I sat in one at one of the 
dealerships around here (Stevinson Imports, Denver -- anyone care to comment
on dealerships in Colorado?  I felt very comfortable with the staff there) 
and due to my height (6'7") I had some problems getting comfortable in it.

Well, two things were suggested to remedy that:  a) get rid of the extra cost
option of the storage bins in the middle console for a little bit more legroom
to the sides, b) order a tip 's' instead of the manual since legroom is tight.

After having heard several ppl say things like "tip 's' screws the exhaust
note up" (compared with manual) and looking at the performance figures, I'm
wondering how much good it really is to go that route.  On the other hand,
the fact that Porsche offers it, to me, sorta means that it can't be all that
bad.  And I like the idea of having the controls on the steering wheel.

Is there anyone else who is as tall as me (with length mostly distributed to 
the legs and not upper body) and would mind sharing some thoughts on this?
Has anyone actually ordered one without middle console?

I know that these subjects have been touched multiple times on this list, and
so far I don't feel that I have enough information to make a decision.  This
whole legroom issue definitely is a make or break thing to me.  I would hate
to have to let this one go because I can't get my damn legs in there.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
Chris
