Hey dudes,

Just thought I'd mention I saw my first Boxster autocross up close.  The car was
driven by a national calibre driver, Arnold Yee and Robert Lu (Robert has trophied
twice at US Nationals out of the three times he's gone).  On the Pirelli PZero
tires the car was bought with (17" with sport suspension), the Boxster beat my
944 Turbo around the tight course by about 0.4 seconds (I was running race rubber).
The car is about 2 seconds slower than a street twin turbo 993, and about the same
speed as a 944 S2 on race rubber.  

All of that really is hard to quantify though as it was only one event and
the course was very tight.  On a larger, more open course, the 944 Turbo would
have done better than the street tire shod Boxster, but the TT would have been
even faster than it was.  

One thing we all noticed was how fluid the car's handling was and how controlled
and tight the whole machine was.  Without wanting to sound too cranky, I'd
have to say that the new generation of Porsches (993 TT and Boxster) really make
my 89 951 feel like an 8 year old car :(

Farzaan.
