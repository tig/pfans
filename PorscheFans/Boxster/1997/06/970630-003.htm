<pre>
Special ordered, tricked out, over $55K sticker.
Buyer backs out, dealer hung up, ripe opportunity.

If you want it now, EMail me.
I'll give you the particulars.
If you know someone who cannot wait, now's the time!

Not only a fine example (new), but dealer is willing to take a hit to move it
out.  His wait list is too short, and he has no takers (as of this moment).
Subject to availability.

Caveat:  I get nothing out of doing this, but somebody might get a real nice
Boxster out of it, that's for sure.

For what it's worth:
Black/black.  Limited Slip.  5 speed.  Upgraded CD.  Full Leather.  Polished
17" wheels.  Sound package (?)  Full power heated seats.  Some kind of aero
kit (unknown what the option numbers are, sorry.)  Delivery miles.

For the serious one, I'll get the full sheet on it for you.
