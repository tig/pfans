I'm due to place my order in a month or two.  I like the manual, but I'm
debating the tiptronic.  I finally got to test drive a tip yesterday.  It
was definitely a lot of fun to drive.  My main complaint was that Porsche
has removed the ability to manually shift from the stick (unless I'm
missing something here) on the Boxster.  I found that when doing a lot of
fast, tight cornering, I would loose track of the +/- buttons on the
steering wheel and couldn't shift until I reposition my hands and located
the buttons, which was very distracting.

I don't want to discredit the tip based on my 20 minute test drive.  I
would like to hear from any people who might be able to help with my
decision making process.  The car will be for general purpose driving
(commuting, traffic, Sunday drives), as well as for lots of sports driving.

Any tip owners having regrets?  Any manual owners wishing they had a tip? 
Is the acceleration or weight distribution noticeably different between the
two?  Anything else I should know about?

- Steve
