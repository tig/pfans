I use the Meguiars 10 & 17 on my Boxster for the past 5 months and it works
great.  I also had a soft window targa for 17 years and used these products
the whole time.  Worked well then and now. Put it on in small circular
motions. 
When putting down the top, I pause half way down and lay a black towel on the
window to keep the two plastic surfaces from rubbing together.  This also
keeps the crease from being so pronounced.
