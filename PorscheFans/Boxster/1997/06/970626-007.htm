The only major thing I know of is the Climate Control & A/C isn't standard equip in Europe. It would really be 
DUMB to take advantage of the console for this, but ya never know. The 'net was my source of the info about 
the stuff behind the console, which is why I threw the verification statement in the above.

Have you peaked behind your console, Jim? Is there anything back there? I'd consider pulling mine.
