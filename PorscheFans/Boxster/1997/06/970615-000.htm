John, I was browsing through the Boxster list (better than doing the =
work currently waiting for me on my kitchen table) when I saw your Car =
Care Specialties thread.  I have to agree with Jay.  I have always found =
Larry very helpful on the phone, and all items have shipped promptly.  =
When some items were backordered, Larry twice sent me letters saying he =
was still waiting and asking if I wanted to cancel.  When the items =
arrived, he shipped them for free.

I haven't emailed him in about a year, but he did respond promptly at =
that time.  I know you first emailed him several months ago, but be =
aware that he tracks a 944 and right now he could be at the Parade.

No affiliation, I'm just a very satisfied customer.
