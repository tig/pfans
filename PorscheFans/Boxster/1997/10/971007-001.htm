In the Aug. 31 issue of the Times three writers were asked to evaluate the
best of four modern 'roadsters'.  Included were the Boxster (of course), the
BMW Z3, Miata M Edition, and Mercedes SLK. 
Criteria, from a list of 12 items, included curb appeal (looks), top
operation, value, and -finally- which would you like to keep in your own
garage.
The short list of four above was derived by them being "spiritually closest
to the intimate European sports cars of the 1950's or 60's- cars that
stimulate, not suppress, the senses."

The Boxster made number one on two of the lists, and last on the other.
Of course, the guy who picked the Boxster last liked the Miata best (?!)

If we were to gauge the merit of the two publications (N.Y. Times &
Car/Driver) based on accumlated Pulitzer prizes, I think the Times would rank
higher.  [Do car rags even get nominated for the Pulitzer??]
It's like hiring a brain surgeon from Harvard Medical School -vs- Ronco Learn
@ Home Neurosurgery Course to explore the occipital lobes of your cerebral
hemispheres.  
There is a difference.
