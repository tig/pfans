A plea for help to those on the waiting list - I'll make it worth your
while if you order a hardtop (for me) with your car, if you're ordering
silver. I'm in California, but could arrange to take a drive to the
surrounding states for pickup. :) Shipping also possible.  Please, help
if you can!

I was unable to obtain a hardtop for my silver Boxster, but the dealer
assured me it would be available after-the-fact. They called Porsche
this morning, and you can order them starting in January. The actual
price has not been established yet, but their best guess
was...$5000-$6000! Ouch.

Keep in mind, it costs around $2500 with the car. Nice markup, eh? Drop
me a line, and help me from increasing the price of the car 10% just for
some winter rain protection. Thanks!
