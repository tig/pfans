Any comments on these two problems that have come up?

1. The hood and trunk openers, under the driver's door, periodically are
locked, without my having activated the central locking switch, located
on the control panel. When this happens, I have to turn on the ignition,
close the driver's door and press the central locking switch. This
occurs without any seeming reason for it.

2. This is new. With the top and windows down, both windows come up to
closed position simultaneously. I recently had some work done on my
stereo system (after market, a  speakerwire had come loose and the
central fuse that drives the stereo blew) and I wonder if that might
have something to do with this. Very annoying.

By the way, I'm still finding it hard to find a real sheepskin or lamb's
wool washing mitt. 

Thanx

Mike
