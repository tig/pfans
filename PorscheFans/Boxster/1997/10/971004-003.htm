Hello Boxster Fans,
I have not been on line for while, just about a month now.  That's because on
Aug. 27  I fially took delivery of my now Silver/ black w/sport package and a
few other small options.  Its everything that I expected plus.  I have put
almost 3000 miles, and I will be changing the oil this weekend coming up.
 Took it to watkens Glen raceway a few weeks ago and to the vintage races.
 What a great cruse from Michigan to the finger lakes region of New York.
 The weather was great and the roads greater.  The car handed like a dream.
 Porsche did there homework on this baby for sure.  On the way home I crused
a speeds between 110 - 125 for about ten minutes on the 401(highway) thru
Canada.  It was like driving 40 mph. 
So far I have I can not find one negitive comment about the car.  I am a 914
guy from way back and still drive one daily.  The mid-engine Boxster is a
sports car lover dream come true.  Every where I go people who don't know
cars want to know what it is, and where can they get one.  I have experanced
so rather hazzardous driving behavior on the parts of others.  while driving
the highways, people will actually try to drive all around you just to see
what it looks like at all angles, with total disreguard for other traffic.
In closing, all I want to tell those of you that are just having fits waiting
for your car to arrive, its truelly worth the wait.  those of you that want
to buy one, go for it.   I do have some concerns about cars built outside of
Germany with the Porsche name.  And for those of you that have the German
built 97 models.  They are and will always be truely rare, I don't care how
many more that they build.
