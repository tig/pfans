I have had a series of problem with my Boxster, purchased in Apr...e.g..

(1) Total lost of power while driving vehicle - The vehicle lost power while
traveling at 45 - 50 miles per hour. Needless to say it was a very bad
experience.  Vehicle at dealership for a approximately three weeks.  The
solution was to replace a speed sensor. (May)

(2) Convertible top unraveling -   The dealer took to days to remove and replace
the top. (July)

(3) Air bag light came on repetitively - Solutions was to replace a lot of
parts..light switches and parts associated with the seat belts.  Vehicle was
taken in to the dealer three times before the problem was resolved. (Aug)

(4) Currently, the vehicle emits smoke when starting.  Sometimes it
happens after
the vehicle sits for a few days, and also during stop and start driving.
I was advised that it is normal...I am suspicious.

Any similar experiences?????
