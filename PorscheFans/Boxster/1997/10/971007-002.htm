....I think you've missed the point of the comparison... The Car and
Driver article was titled "The Best-Handling Car for More Than
$30,000".  If you'd actually read it, you would've seen the
following sentence, which neatly summarizes the criteria that
the magazine's "inept" editors used:

    "In choosing our contestants, we selected the best-handling
    cars we could think of that cost more than $30,000 and
    represent a broad array of driveline configurations."....

-->  I think what paul ment was that some of the cars chosen were not
chosen carefully.  If the prices are over $30,000, then why wasn't a
porsche 911 GT1 or Ferrari f50 chosen??  And why did the editors choose the
base boxster, not the one with the sport package.  And also why did they
choose the carrera S?  Why not the Carerra 4, or Turbo or even Turbo S? 
Certainly the Carrera S would not perform better than the normal carrera
(i.e. added weight, drag, etc).  I think the point Paul was trying to make
was that the editors needed a cover story so they slapped one together for
the readers who just wanted to see some of the best cars from some of the
best manufacturers.  (I know cause the only reason I bought the article was
because of the two porsches).  And what about the testers?  What were their
qualifications, if any?  Were they actual racers with experience, like in
that motortrend article (cant remember what it was called).
