Having reviewed the options available after I got my black/black Boxster, I've 
determined I would have liked to have ordered a few more. I'm into gadgets, 
and like to get every knob, stalk, and button available. Extra chrome, wood, 
and leather doesn't do it for me, but buttons are great!

I recommend the Sport Package (P16). The six options (speakers, cruise 
control, remote control alarm, windstop, in-dash CD player, and 17" wheels) 
are well worth the money.

The on-board computer (659), while expensive for what it does, gives you an 
extra stalk on the steering wheel (as does the cruise control). It also gives 
you a read-out below the LED speedometer. And the info is rather useful, such 
as how far you can go with your remaining fuel. I don't regret having it.

I live in the Seattle area where it rains for 9 1/2 months of the year. The 
hard-top (550) is a requirement, but I took it off immediately after I got it 
in August. It will have to go on in a week or two as the rainy season is upon 
us here. It gives you a button on the dash to activate the rear-window 
defroster.

I liked deleting the model designation (498). People can't figure out what 
kind of car it is (a real plus when someone can't call 911 and say "There is 
this Black Boxster travelling over 100 mph on I90!"), and I think it makes the 
rear of the car look even better. The only markings on the outside of my car 
(after I replaced the dealer license plate frames) are the small Porsche logo 
on the front and on the wheels.

If you like, you can add the remote 6 CD changer (692) in addition to the 
in-dash CD player. I did. The Becker stereo supports both. To get the changer 
otherwise requires breaking up the sport package, which would be more 
expensive than the changer in addition to the sport package. Incidentally, the 
6 CD cartridges for the changer are compatible with Sony XA-T6 cartridges.

I think the traction control (P37) is a requirement. It also gives you an 
extra button on the dash to turn it off.

And I got the (424) CD storage shelves. Holds 4 CDs, without the Jewel cases 
in the center dash. A toss-up on whether I'd get this if I had to do it over.

What I didn't get, but kind of wish I had:

The heated seats (P14), which gives you two extra buttons on the center 
console.

The headlight washers (288), which activate when you push the washer stalk 
away from you. It also gives you a much larger washer fluid reservoir.

And possibly the lighted sun-visors (XMP or XMR). I'm looking to replace the 
sun-visors with some after market ones that don't have the painted-on airbag 
warnings. If I can get some that are lighted at the same time, I'll get them. 
(Anybody know of any?)

I tried to get the non-smoker package that was initially listed as an option, 
but Porsche apparently decided not to offer it after all.

Save your money on the floor mats and buy them after you get the car. They're 
cheaper as parts and you don't have to pay luxury tax on them. In Washington 
State getting them afterwards also saves you from having to keep paying for 
them every year when you get your license tabs.

I was going to get silver too, until I saw it on the car. I decided I didn't 
like it and went with black instead. Black looks very cool and saved over $700 
on the silver.

I'm also seriously considering having Stone-Guard added (a clear adhesive 
covering on the front of the car) before I get any major nicks.

Greg
