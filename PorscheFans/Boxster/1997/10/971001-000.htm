          I transported from Pittsburgh to Dallas and used Horseless
Carriage (a cover truck)  great service once they picked it up.  Please
prepare yourself for a 2-3 week delay from time of order placement.  It
seems that due to auctions and such trucks can be difficult to locate.
There is also an ad in Panorama for another carrier that is supposed to be
excellent.  I worked an arrangement for being on the list of two firms with
the only proviso being that when they called to confirm a pickup they would
be first choice and not send someone only to be surprised that the other
carrier had suddenly appeared and got the run.

You dealer probably can give you good insight for a carrier if these do not
meet your needs.
