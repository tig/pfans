Had to laugh.
The Boxster hood latches are mechanical, operated by a cable.

Pellow, "The Maesstro" as he calls himself, was referring to the 'Industrial'
Boxster, not the same cars we drive.  Everyone should know these Industrial
Boxsters have many additional features excluded in the final version,
including electric latches.  HCP Research, Pellows' company, must have the
sole source on Industrial Boxsters.

I'll bet a book is in the offing; one full of dangling participles, rambling
drivel, and bizarre dissociation.  [All of which is required when lofting
-through lauding- ones self to a higher place.]

If you are interested in buying an Industrial Boxster, feel free to call him
to discuss purchase options available- 408/727-1864.  Reverse charges if
possible.
