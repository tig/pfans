Perhaps leaving the key in had the electronic key code verification 
system running continuously.  That would probably kill your battery, 
which would explain the failure of the auto-rolldown feature.

The doctor says if it hurts, don't do that... ;)

Tales for a new corporate america:

 Once, when I was a little boy, I went fishing.  I caught fish after
 fish, and let them all go, until I'd caught the biggest fish in the
 pond.  Then I pulled out my hammer to kill him.

 He looked at me in surprise and said "Why are you going to kill me,
 after letting all of the other fish go?  Are you going to eat me
 because I'm the biggest?"

 I looked at him sadly before replying "No, I just have to make sure 
 that you never get big enough to eat me."

 Whack.
