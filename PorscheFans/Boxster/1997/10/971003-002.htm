Well, its time to place our order!  Our dealer called and has a December
or January slot for us.  The wait wasn't bad.  We placed our deposit
August 5 and were about 30th on the list.  Apparently, a number of folks
ahead of us elected to pass on an early winter build and delivery in the
New England snow.  Of course, it might have helped that my wife ordered
a new E-class from this dealer last month for delivery in a couple of
weeks!  We go over next Tuesday to decide on colors and options. Color
has been a tough one.  We thought about white/blue or black/red but,
after considerable discussion, we've decided on Arctic Silver with
Boxster red.  We know it's a common color combination, but, then again,
Boxsters still are not a very common sight around here.  Silver just
seems right on this car. We'll probably get the sport package and maybe
a hardtop for a more comfortable winter season.  Does anyone have any
experience with the hardtop in a cold/wet climate?  Also does anyone
know about the Soft Look Leather (Option 982) or any of the electric
seat options (P15, 513, 588)?  Also, although we don't plan on driving
in the worst of the snow, does anyone have experience or a
recommendation on traction control (P87)?  Finally, we've thought about
ordering a grey top in order to give us a small degree of uniqueness.
Does anyone have any experience with a grey top?  Thanks in advance for
any info.   Neal.
