    Paul:

    I think you've missed the point of the comparison... The Car and
    Driver article was titled "The Best-Handling Car for More Than
    $30,000".  If you'd actually read it, you would've seen the
    following sentence, which neatly summarizes the criteria that
    the magazine's "inept" editors used:

        "In choosing our contestants, we selected the best-handling
        cars we could think of that cost more than $30,000 and
        represent a broad array of driveline configurations."

    I don't think so.  Judging from Car and Driver's, Road &
    Track's, and Automobile Magazine's cover photos and feature
    articles over the last couple of years, those so-called hacks
    would've chosen a Porsche for you.
