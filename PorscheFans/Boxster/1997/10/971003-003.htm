I must be missing a point here, but if battery is "dead flat", how =
jumping the fuse will solve any problem. I guess someone with free time =
can try to experiment by disconnecting battery, closing the trunk and =
then trying to open it again. (just kidding)

One the different subject. I've noticed, that my car is starting to =
rattle from the engine compartment at about 2200 rpm. After taking car =
to the dealer, and talking with Porsche rep it appears, that all cars =
exhibit this problem at some degree. Looks like noise is coming from =
manifold (sp?), the way I understand, is that the air inside manifold =
causes it to resonate at the certain frequency. I am wondering if any =
one had similar experience.

In response to the comment "just open the drivers door and release the
hood"... Sorry folks, if the battery is dead flat, the trunk remains =
locked
as the solinoid is not activated to unlock the handle. Entry is gained =
by
jumping the fuse. Contact your dealer for a Service Information =
detailing how
to do this...=20
Mabros....=20
