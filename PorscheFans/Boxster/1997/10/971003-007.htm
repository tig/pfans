ATTENTION!  ALERT!  ATTENTION!

The child seats - which  were just released two weeks ago -  have been
recalled (as mine was being installed!).  Germany has refused to tell PCNA
why.

I spoke with Pat Hogan (head of customer relations) in Reno. He was
embarrased for Porsche.  I suggested he call Gemany and ask for additional
information.  He said they've tried that as well as e-mailing but the
fatherland refuses comment.  Since PCNA is just a distributor "there is not
much they can do."  After wating eight months for the seat, I am really
pissed off!   There is no excuse for being left in the dark.

Anyway, one of their own is going to a tech meeting in Germany next  week and
will press the issue face to face. 

If anyone has any other info please post.
