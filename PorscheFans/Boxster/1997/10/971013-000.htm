Thanks to everybody who wrote back with feedback about my car not starting
problem.
Seems like you should never leave the key in the ignition.  This is the
first car I know of that leaving the key in the ignition will kill the
battery.  I guess it's one more reason this car is so unique...

I got my car to start going again.  I called Porsche roadside assistance
and they sent somebody within 20 minutes.  
But now I have another problem;

When I lower the top the windows will go down all the way instead of just
a little bit.  Same when I put the top up.  
Any ideas?

Thanks again in advance,

Alberto.

PS.  Had my first long drive.  Went down to Cape Cod.  Beautiful day,
beautiful car, beautiful area.  What a drive.  I am SCARED at how well
this car handles.  No need to say anything about the stares, compliments
etc... Even 8 year olds were yelling "nice car".
