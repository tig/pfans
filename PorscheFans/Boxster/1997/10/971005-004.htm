Hayward and others,

I also have a concern about the new Boxters built in Finland - it seems
that they'll have to go through the same learning curve that the folks in
Germany have gone through - so the first year's cars are probably going to
be problematic - if not longer.

Is there a way to specify that you want a German-built car when you place
an order? My understanding is that only a portion of the cars will be built
in Finland - I if they will focus on producing for a given geographic model
(e.g. British - left hand, etc.)?

Brian.

I do have some concerns about cars built outside of
>Germany with the Porsche name.  And for those of you that have the German
>built 97 models.  They are and will always be truely rare, I don't care how
>many more that they build.
