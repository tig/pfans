As to the issue of not starting, the owners manual tells you not to leave the
key in the car for long periods.  When you do this the drive block system is
enabled.  Please read the section in your manual under vehicle security.

I wash my care and detail it weekly.  It does'nt matter which car wash soap
you use as long as it has the proper ph balance.  I am presently useing Zymol
auto wash, and am very pleased with it.  On a clean surface ( such as a new
Boxster) I highly recomment Mequiar's #26 proffessional Hi-Tech Yellow Wax.
Its pure carnauba with no cleaners.  Goes on easy and comes off equally so.
 My silver / blk beauty looks like glass all the time.  I had one lady how
just had to feel the finish, tell me it feel like silk...

If you call Mequiar's car care @ 800-545-3321, and answer a few questions
about your care and geographifcal area, they will send you a personalized
"Car care prescription guide".

Hope this info helps    Hseymore@aol.com
