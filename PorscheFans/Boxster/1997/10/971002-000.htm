Before you flame someone, it would be nice to be SURE your information is
correct.  It appears Harry was HALF correct, which is just as correct as YOU
were.  I'm surprised that you laughed at reading the post, since you
obviously have an underdeveloped sense of humor, not being able to take
Harry's ramblings for what they are: attempts to add a bit of humor, in a
slightly bent way, to the "serious" matter of dealing with our obsession
with a car.
