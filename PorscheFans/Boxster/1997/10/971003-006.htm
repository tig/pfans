Hey folks.

Thought I'd start a big argument.  Maybe not, though - I suppose given
the forum we could have a unanimous decision.

The September 1997 issue of "Car and Driver" magazine attempted to find
the best-handling car for > US$30,000.  The cars tested were:

Porsche Boxster
Porsche 911 Carrera S
Chevrolet Corvette
Dodge Viper GTS
Toyota Supra Turbo
Acura NSX-T
Ferrari F355
BMW M3

They finished in reverse order, i.e. the M3 took top honors and the
Boxster came in dead last.  You'll have to check out
www.caranddriver.com for the test specs - I won't waste bandwidth here.

First of all I'm shocked that the two Porsches were rated this poorly by
a magazine that consistently gushes over them.  But that's neither here
nor there - the folks at C&D are comparing apples and oranges to a great
degree, and that topic has been beaten to death in this forum.  

The original comparo done by C&D nigh some 12 long months ago, among the
true competitors for the Boxster, placed the Boxster atop the heap with
the SLK and Z3 in 2nd and 3rd, respectively. Since that time two
significant things have happened:
1.  The Z3 has gotten a bigger powerplant (6 vs. 4 cyl).
1a.  The Z3 will get an "M" engine (a la M3) making 250HP sometime early
next year.
2. Chevy has introduced the new Corvette convertible, which qualifies as
a roadster (it even has a speedster-like roof cover), and is in the same
price range.  
2a. Chevy's LT1 powerplant makes 345HP right now.

If we ran the test today, with SLK, Z3, Boxster, and Corvette, how would
it turn out?  I think perhaps the Boxster wouldn't fare as well in its
current configuration.

According to the documentation, the Vette outperforms the Boxster on all
counts:  Cornering, Accelleration, Braking, Skidpad.  The Z3 probably
beats the Box on Accelleration and Skidpad but not Cornering or Braking.
The SLK moves into 4th but still has the coolest top.

1. 98 corvette convertible
2. z3
3. boxster
4. SLK

I haven't driven the 98 vette convertible yet.  This is all (as
objective as I can be) pure conjecture on my part, and my facts are
taken largely from the pages of C&D and R&T. Is it time to make the
Boxster beefier?  Will that price it out of our reach?  Is it OK for our
beloved Boxster to be in the middle of the heap, performance-wise? How
much power does a roadster really need?  I'm interested in the opinions
of the group.

Regards,

Holding out for an "S".
