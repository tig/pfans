Ha.  Any competitive organisaton with field sales operations and taxes
and import duties and customs to pay (off) will not be looking to
publicise its performance to the market or to its competitors.

Putting sales related information on the Web is just not going to happen
-- not for technical reasons, just pure 'value of competitive
information.'

It is cheaper, quicker and generally easier to have each dealer receive
the list electronically, but then, if information falls into the 'wrong'
hands, it can be difficult to trace the leak.  By using printouts and off
line servers, each dealer gets a coded set of information.  If that
information finds itself astray, the rightful owner will identify the
origin of the printout by examining the 'fingerprint' of the printout or
the server copy of the information.

I could imagine that Porsche NA would be willing to provide a service
where each customer can have their vehicle information emailed to them. 
A new customer can track their order from week to week.  Existing
customers can check their service history, be advised of defects and
recalls.  Someone buying a used Porsche could request that same service
information etc.

ps.  A note on servicing in the future


As a matter of interest, some new cars (I think Honda, Mercedes and BMW)
will soon have the ability to 'phone home.'  This system already exists
in the McLaren F1.  The service mechanic attaches a phone line to the car
and the on board computer dials into the service centre.  The car is then
serviced by remote control and interim statistics are downloaded to the
central service computer.  The service person is advised by the car of
any work to be done and any advisories, defect notices etc pertaining to
_this particular vehicle_ from the factory computer.


Thus a permanent record of the vehicle usage is maintained.  The factory
can look at the exact workload of every car they sell.  This information
can be automatically analysed by statistical software to identify
valuable 'data points.'  Perhaps Turbo owners tend to leave their car
idling for too long or too short a time before driving away -- warranting
a service advisory to owners suggesting the correct practices.  A driver
that repeatedly hits the rev-limiter could be advised of the impact on
their warranty for this engine and so on.


One day not too far off, this will happen by radio while the vehicle is
in motion.  For example, as your car <italic>decides</italic> to get a
service (maybe a fuel filter is effecting fuel metering causing leaning
in one cylinder more than another.)  So the car checks in with the
service computer, schedules a visit, maybe puts up a notice on the dash
and emails the owner with a request to confirm the service visit -- it
could even check into his electronic schedule, find a gap and relay the
information to his 'personal digital assistant' sitting on the front seat
in his (Porsche Design) briefcase.


The service centre is advised on the filter parts and an order is placed
for 'just in time' delivery.  A mechanic is given a  note on his
worksheet for that day, including a 'pointer' to the necessary computer
based training materials to be reviewed (if needed) before commencing the
work, including any pointers to related work and physical tests that
should be performed in association with the required work.


To continue the example, if the engine was running lean on the left bank
of cylinders, maybe there is other work that should be done.  Maybe a
visual inspection of each piston head through the spark plug holes is
warranted.  Maybe, at least the plugs should be cleaned and gapped.


The service centre also manages its workload for the day, reviews the
general health of the car, records this information and emails the
customer with details -- the email includes digital photographs of the
parts replaced and the inspection of the piston heads and the engineer
that actually did the work could leave a note on his work.  The cost of
the service is exact and comes from factory recommended time and material
charges.
