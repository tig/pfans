Sorry Adam, you first three answers are wrong. I responded to Garry
personally, but I'll post the answers here for the rest of you.

1. "European delivery for the Boxster begins July 1st. Period.," said
PCNA. The first of two "Grand Tours" is on July 3rd and 4th. The second
is in October.  My car, previously scheduled for July production has
been re-ordered as a Tourist Delivery car and will be ready on July 3
when I arrive in Stuttgart. The program is for Boxsters and 993s, not
just Boxsters.

2. No, Tourist Delivery does not save any money, in fact it costs some.
There has, in the past, been a discount on the 993. That is not the case
for the Boxster and probably will not be the case for all future Porsche
cars. Tourist Delivery (at least for US residents) requires a $10,000
Value Added Tax (VAT) deposit. This is the figure for the 993 and *may*
go down to about $6,500 for the Boxster. The deposit is returned as soon
as the car reaches the US (minus %4). The VAT deposit is to make sure
you bring the car back to the US and don't sell it while on vacation in
Europe (they cost a lot more there).

3. The $261 "Floor mats with a leather Exclusive "Porsche" logo
imprinted" are option XX1. There are $90 floor mats (option M6_) now
available from the factory. See
http://boxster/berkeley/Porsche/OptionsUpdates.htm (page down to the
Boxster #97003 Option Update).

4. I can't imagine that the colors do not have a clear coat. A1 is
standard black.

5. ?

Additionaly, you seem to be on track for delivery, Garry. I put down my
deposit in October and will get the car in July. I'm glad that others
may have received their cars sooner, but I know far more people who
waited longer than we will. 

You should be able to sign up for the October Grand Tour. Contact your
Sales *Manager* and if he can't help (it sounds like he can't), call
Barbara Phelps at PCNA in Reno, NV at (702) 348-3000 or (800) 545-8039.
They will change your order by filling out a "Tourist Deilvery Program
Car Order Form." Then you car will be moved up (if necessary) in
production to be ready on time. The details of the program are still
being finalized and the dealers may not even know about the availability
of the program yet. My dealer didn't, but certainly does now.

I spent a lot of time on the phone for a lot of weeks trying to get the
"straight" story and I finally have. I hope this helps everyone.
