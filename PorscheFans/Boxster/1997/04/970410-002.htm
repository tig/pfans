>I been waiting since December of 1996 to take delievery of me car. Yesterday


Did you place your order in Dec or was that the est. ship date?  Some cars really did show in Dec, but not for customers, only as dealer 'show and no go' cars.  I placed an order in October and received the car in the second week of January.


>they told me it won't be until October, hence I will recieve a 98 at 98 MSRP.


Sounds like you're being cheated.  October is very late in the year by any measure.  I presume you're paying MSRP.  I'd ask them to show you the Porsche vehicle order, manufacturing and shipment history for your order.  I saw my printout each week until it arrived in the dealership.  I think they've 'bumped' your order (maybe for someone willing to pay over MSRP.)  If they can't show a single, consistent order against your name, it's time to find another dealer and complain to Porsche NA about this dealer.


>I also was told European delievery is out of the question. My question to

Entirely out of the question.  I understand from reading the Euro mags that factory delivery is off the agenda until they clear back orders (some of which are being assembled in Finland -- anyone want a 924?  sorry.)


>you folks is:

>1. Is European delievery available starting September 1st?

I think not.

>2. Dose it save you any money?

Yes.  The dealer will calculate the delivery, repackaging, shipment, insurance etc. costs.  You have to pay the import duty to US Customs.  I'm told it's of the order of 10% -- enough to pay for your round trip.  Regardless of cost, I can't imagine a more enjoyable experience -- except Maranello might be a more exciting destination than Stuggart.


>3. Do floor mats really cost$261.00 a pair??? Don't they come with the car?

Cheap at half the price.  Don't forget it's a leather Porsche imprint.

Come on, have you even looked at the options list for the car?  Have you really ordered a car without knowing the standard equipment list?  I apologise for such direct questions, but it's your responsibility to understand and decide on the options before the event, no?


>4. I ordered the exterior black, code A1, is this a clear coat? My dealer

>can't even answer this question.

Fair question.  I know they use water-based paint.  I couldn't tell you from looking, but the Ocean Blue is apparently clear coat.  It's a $789.00 option and the Black is no-charge, but I presume it's the same quality.  I've seen a black car in a dealer and I didn't notice any lesser finish.


>5.What model Sony trunk mounted Cd player will work with the stock Becker,

>are the din plugs and wiring already inplace like in my BMW???

The mounting and wiring is there (and very specific to the model of player, including the mounting hardware.)  The changer (I didn't order one) is described as "Porsche CDC3" and it holds 6 discs (not cool) and it costs $815 (a little high.)


>Any or all questions answered will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.


What can I say?  Get a better dealer.  Shop around.  Check out magazines (DuPont, Excellence, Autoweek) and you'll see dozens of ads for the car and the overzealous market is dying out.  Also, the current news from Porsche is for 2.5 turbo and 3.0 normally aspirated versions of te Boxster available early '98, so the current vehicle (apparently free from anything but minor service notices) will be substantially devalued when the improved article is officially recognised (usually about a week before the launch -- to minimise 'drought' at the dealers.)
