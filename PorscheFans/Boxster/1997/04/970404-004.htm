Hi there:

My dad(*) is about to take delivery of his within the next few weeks and is
getting it with roof rack.  However, last I heard was that there's zero need
ordering the car and the rack together, because it's a part that is supposed
to fit on any car, regardless of the configuration (well, assuming you do
not have major bodywork done which might obstruct the rack fittings.

(*) I'm German, and so's my dad, and he's obviously taking delivery in Hamburg,
Germany.  For the curious, it'll be an arctic silver 986, Sport Touring
Package (manual), carbon dash etc, special red leather, and some other
body mods, to mention major options.  My dad collects cars, has
restored traditional MB SL's for all his life, drives an A8 quattro
to work and we're otherwise a happy German family without brand bigotry.
So, please spare me with such remarks.

Happy to have joined the list recently, and looking forward to more
discussions.. and please, if I ever don't make any sense, slap me hard and
perhaps all it is, is my English half of the brain had just gone out for lunch.
;-)

It looks like I will spend early fall in Hamburg (best time of the year, it's
way up north and 2nd largest city of Germany after Berling -- it used to be
the largest city in West Germany -- just thought I'd throw that in for you
guys with the confused looks on your faces ;-) and will be taking the 986 for 
a bunch of trips.  Perhaps that'll tie me over until I can take delivery of
my 986 sometimes early '98 (says the dealership).

For now, I am ordering mine with roofrack & hard top.  But, since I'm
several months away from spec'ing mine, I'm still debating what to do with 
the rest of the possible choices (just too many, after I've just gotten
used to US option diet of all other brands).  Either way, the 986 will
definitely be my daily driver -- unless Audi will be bringing the new A6 
to the US this fall.. so flame me. ;-)

For one thing, I'm not sure I really want yet another arctic silver and but
perhaps pastel yellow, zenith blue or arena red. ;-)

Anyways, if everything breaks, I might be able to work something out with
getting roof racks directly from Germany (although, it might be significantly
more expensive than buying it from a dealership here, because of tarriffs,
taxes and the whole works).

Anyways, anyone on the list have their Boxster beauty ordered with Tips ?
I haven't driven one myself and heard lots of mixed reports about the quality
of the new Tips compared with the 911 Tips.

Ok ok, as a German, I probably shouldn't even be thinking about ordering
something without a stick, but, but, I get lazy at times, too, not to mention
that I think gear controls on the steering wheel are a slick thing(TM).

Fire away with any comments you may have.. ;-)

Cheers,
Chris
