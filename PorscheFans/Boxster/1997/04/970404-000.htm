b-pfans,

	Sorry for the repost, but the first time I posted this, I received no 
replies, nor the digest for that day.  So I'm assuming many other digest 
recipients didn't get it either.

        My silver p38 equipped (tech suspension, abd, 17") Boxter is due
in August from last dealer report.  I was given a reference #, and told
that I have very little time to change my option list.  I originally
wanted a roof carrier (for bicycles, skis, lumber??? and even my uncle's
wheel chair), but was told that it wasn't yet an available option, and
including it on the order would cause the entire order to bounce.  In my last
conversation with my pdealer, I was told that the carrier still isn't an
option, and may not be an option at all in the U.S.

Is this consistent with what you all have heard?  Is there any
other way to get the carrier (grey market?  Anyone visiting d-land to
pick up their Boxter?  After market?).  Presumably, all of the boxters
are equipped with the receiver sockets to accept the carrier.

TIA
