My Boxster has about 1000 miles and has recently developed two
problems.  I'm looking to find out if these are familiar to anyone.

Now, just about whenever I drive 20 miles or more, the ABS warning
light comes on on the dash.  Has this happened to anyone else?  I'm
taking it to the dealer for a 1K oil change tomorrow and they are going
to look at it.

Yesterday, when I put the top up, I noticed an elastic band sticking
out from the top around the plastic trim.  At the end was a conical
plastic affair about 15mm long.  When I put the top down halfway, I
can see a circular doo-hickey that the conical thing is supposed to
fit into.  Unfortunately, several of the little plastic teeth that
hold the cone were broken.  I'll have the dealer look at this too.  I
wonder if it was like this when I got it?

Other than these relatively minor things, I'm loving my Boxster!
