  Subject: Is the Boxster really worth $57,000????

  Team,
  Do you think the Boxster is worth $57,000 taxes, license included
  out the
  door??? does this thing draw enough stares, or drive like so great
  to justify
  this cost... what do you say?  Or is it just hype??  The Boxster I
  am
  thinking of picking up for this price is a  Boxster arctic
  silver/red,
  tiptronic, sport package, mats,
  painted crests on wheels.  I think the Boxster looks great but what
  makes
  this thing worth so much????  Boxster owners?????

  Thanks,
  All opinions welcome...

Hi,

I think that, for some strange reason, it is worth it. BTW, I just went
to the Porsche dealership in Ottawa, to buy a Boxster, and I was told
that there is a 6
month waiting list. Any thoughts on that? I was told that no matter
where I go,
I would still have to wait that long to pick one up. Does anyone have
any creative ideas on where I can get one right away?
Do you honestly think that tiptronic, would be better than standard? I
am asking because I can't really make up my mind!

Thanks.
