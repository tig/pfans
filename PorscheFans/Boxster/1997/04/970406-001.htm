Last week my wife and I ordered a 1998 Boxster at our favorite local
dealership.  We requested delivery no earlier than 2/1/98.  It will be
interesting to see how the dealership arranges and schedules this. 

The funniest part of ordering was the assumptive tone of the salesperson
on the first attempt:  "We can deliver your 1997 Boxster in November of
1997."  My first thoughts:  Great, then I can put it right into storage.
We live in the upper midwest.

After test driving the Boxster it seemed that a few more horsepower and
much more torque would make the car fit my tastes better, but since this
configuration is what the Porsche engineers saw fit to put together for a
first shot, I figured, what the heck, try the recommended setup.  Also,
the car will be driven more by my wife than myself.  Political correctness
aside, she should be more comfortable in a car with a less aggressive
torque curve.  We added the traction control and the non-sporting sports
package (P63). 

In talking with the dealer re. the rumored bigger displacement "S" model,
his first question to me was "do you really want to spend $10,000 for more
power?"  I suspect his question was based on prior experience with the
Porsche line, and I accept his prescience.  After careful study of the
shocking pp. 4-10 of the dealer options list, it looks like the profit
enhancing options are made available for those of us wanting to pay *any*
price to be different.  

Pretty strange stuff.  Has anyone else really read everything in those
options pages?  Does any of it look worth the price?  She went for the
Boxster Red interior.  I was tempted on the $1255 X26 "Airbag Steering
wheel complete interior color leather", but she talked me out of it.  I
was also tempted on the XLA "Exhaust pipe (Boxster optics, larger cross
section, chrome oval pipe in the middle)" just because it sounded
technoidal, but I talked myself out of that one.  Why are there so many
strange little leather covered options on this car?  Is this normal
Porsche technique?
