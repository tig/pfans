Just a quick update.  Driving along minding my own business at around 70 when
the check engine light came on.  No change in performance, just that little
light.  I pulled over, read the manual which basically said, don't worry
immediately, but take it to a dealer as soon as possible.  Turning the car off
and on again twice or three times in fairly quick succession did not change
anything.  I stopped for over one half hour and when I returned the light was
out.

The dealership down loaded the fault to find one of the O2 sensors before the
cat had reported a fault.  Their advice was to see if it happened again and they
would replace the parts.  Said it was not specifically Boxster related, but in
the emissions system.

FYI
