I think you have the 'complete' list.
My list shows P17 is the code for manual trans, and P18 as the code for Tiptronic, otherwise the 
same package. BTW, I believe these have been renumbered P43/P44. The "Technic Sport 
package" (P38) is the tuned springs, shocks, sway bars, traction control and 17" Boxster-style 
wheels/tires. Be aware of the P16 "Sport Package" which has only the wheels, none of the other 
suspension bits (lots of other stuff though).

Dealer here has no official info on the "S". He has been told no planned changes (price/spec) for 
MY1998 Boxsters, but that doesn't proclude a 'new model' does it?

My salesman is leasing himself a Boxster. Placed his order (after me), for exactly what he wanted. 
I better get mine, before he gets his! ;-) He tells me leasing played no role in the order process.

I'm told that MY1997 Boxsters will be built into July. Production resumes in Sept, as MY1998.

Remember, they're worth, exactly, what you paid me for them!
