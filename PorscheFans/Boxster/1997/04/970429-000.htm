I am eagerly awaiting news on the arrival of my Boxster.  It apparently did
not make the  ship departing Homburg on 3 April.  I have not yet gone to my
local library to get port news from the Charleston, SC paper, but I'm almost
ready.  Has anyone heard from their dealer when the subsequent
 departure/arrival dates were/are?  I have the VIN for my car, so I feel
confident that arrival is imminent-perhaps within two weeks-but I just wish
there was a better system for us to track the progress of our orders.
          
     On another issue, Robin at Automotion assures me that they are now
producing covers for the Boxster(without any tell-tale markings).  I still
wonder about lambskins?
     With regard to the interior, I am pleased to have ordered my car with
the Boxster Red leather interior.  I was reluctant to do so when I saw some
of the initial photos of the car in magazines, but was happily pleased with
what I saw  in Los Angeles at the Auto Show.  Pictures just don't do it
justice.  I hope anyone ordering a car has the opportunity to see the various
interior options prior to placing their final selection, because it really
made a difference in my choice.
