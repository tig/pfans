The Boxster board has been dead fo the last few days. Where is everyone?

Question for you all you current Boxster owners. What has been your
impression of the quality of the interior especially the Grey dash? I
have only seen the black interior and have not been impressed. It seemed
to be of cheaper/less quality than my BMW 318.

Note: Today was to be the completion  of manufacture of my boxster.  I
can still refuse the car, and am concidering reordering a car with a all
leather interior. Any comments? Is the Boxster Red interior much better
then the standard interior?  Has Anyone seen the Nephrite Green?  What
exterior color would one combine with Nephrite Green? 

Thanks for the comments and opinions!!

JOHN FELKRE
