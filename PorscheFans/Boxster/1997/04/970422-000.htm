You've thinking about buying the exact car that I have and I think it's
worth every penny of the $57,130 I paid for it. It is an awesome
machine. I never realized that an automatic transmission could be so
much fun, and so much convenience when I need it. I was originally going
to go for the Savannah Beige interior but now that I've got the Boxster
Red leather, I think it is just beautiful.

The car does attract a lot of attention from people of all ages and all
walks of life. All seem to agree that it's a beautiful automobile. I
think the quality of workmanship is up to Porsche's traditional
excellent standards.  Overall, I think this is the best deal out there.
This is leading edge stuff. Next year, the 911-series cars are going to
look just like the Boxster from the front and they're going to have the
water-cooled engine. This is my first BRAND NEW Porsche and I'm loving
it. My recommendation to you is not to dally too long making your
decision. These babies are hard to come by. And I think they're going to
get harder. I just heard a rumor that Porsche is pushing out delivery
for cars manufactured in July and August until the first of the year.
