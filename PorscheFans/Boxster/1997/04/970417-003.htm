Because you have to drive it five days a week in heavy
commuter traffic?

Most of us can't afford a fun "Sunday Boxster" as well as a
"daily driver" automobile.  The tiptronic is a good
compromise when the car is also used for required & tedious
0-25-0-25 mph city driving.

I'm just upset that the "smart transmission" is so
expensive!
