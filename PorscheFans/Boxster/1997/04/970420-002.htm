I sent you a response regarding your Tiptronic S (I can't believe you said 
what you said about Women and Porsches-if I were you I'd avoid any rallys for 
awhile-Ha!) concerns but in seeing it in print my answer seemed garbled and in 
numbered paragraphs.  So I'll repeat my observations here.  As I said I 
currently drive an M-3 coupe.  It is really a dream car in many ways. Fast, 
fun to drive (I have a 5speed) great around town and very comfortable on long 
trips.  No maintenace costs in first 18,000  miles, no complaints.  However, 
I'm a car nut (34 cars since 1960) so I'm always searching.  

BMW stopped importing the M-3 coupe with a the 5 speed automatic and I was 
tried of shifting and my wife does not know how to use a stick and didn't want 
to learn.  The porsche seemed a viable alternative.  So, I spent about 40 
minutes in a Boxster T-S and I'll tell you it is a terrific car to drive.  Not 
only is it fast (of course nothing is fast enough) but the smart transmission 
programs itself to a drivers driving style when in the Auto mode.  For 
example, three or four firm blips on the gas in neutral puts the tranny in 
race mode which keeps you in gear to a higher rev limit than normal.  It's 
really to much to go into here but suffice to say the difference in 0-60 time 
for the Tiptronic in manual mode over the stick is less than the human eye can 
detect (7/10th of a second) and besides who's drag racing these days in a $50K 
car?  One dislike is the fact that the Tiptronic defaults to 2nd gear in 
either mode when coming to a stop.  If in auto mode you have to live with that 
because there is not specific gear selection. In manual mode you can use the 
steering wheel button to drop into 1st before starting out.  All in all not 
much to worry about.  Have fun... MDM from BH
