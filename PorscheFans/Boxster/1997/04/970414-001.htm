I am still trying to get some infornation on wheather or not a dealer
allocation order can be tracked.  I am hearing about many of you that
have
recieved your cars, yet who have not had a deposit on them as long as I
have.
 I happy that you all are enjoying you Boxsters.  However, I just want
to
find out if my dealer is giving me the run around.  My deposit was made
in
Dec. of 1995, and I was told that I would recieve my car in Jan/Feb 1997
time
frame.  Just last week I recieved a fax from the dealer showing that my
car
had just been ordered.  It gave a dealer req.# and a allocation date of
july.
  Anyone have any ideas???  And once the order is in, can it be
tracked???
 Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Hello, Hayward,

Sounds like you may very well be getting screwed by your dealer (or
they're just grossly inept!). If you placed your deposit December of
'95, you should have been really early on the list for ordering. I can't
imagine there would have been too many deposits before you at that time.

From what I understand, the Jan/Feb allocations were cars that were
shipped to the dealers unspecified (i.e. dealers got whatever Porsche
decided to ship to them) and they should have gone down the list of
customers w/ deposits asking them if they wanted such-and-such a car.
After that, custom orders should have started with March delivery,on a
first-deposited-first-served basis. By that standpoint, if you were one
of the first ones on the list, you should have been asked to order in
December '96 or so, given the options list, etc., and your order should
have gone through then.

There have been plenty of delays slowing down delivery after the order
placement, (latest of which, according to my dealer, is that cars with
full leather or X/Y options will now officially be delayed) but I can't
imagine why your order would pe placed so late. The only two things I
can think of that would legitimately delay your order placement would
be: a) There just happened to be a lot of early deposits placed before
yours at your dealer, and/or b) your dealership had a really low car
allocation due to being a low volume dealer (?) or being in Porsche's
bad books.

The two things you should find out from your dealer should be: how many
people put down deposits before you, and how many cars have been
delivered so far? Unless there's some specific problem with the
configuration of your car which the dealer should be able to tell you
about, if those numbers don't add up, something's fishy.

This is what my experience has been: put a deposit down July '96 and was
told I was #26 on the list at that time. At the time I was told they
were expecting an allocation of 10 cars/month. I don't know how that
measures up nationwide, but since this is a pretty big dealer in San
Diego (Porsches everywhere) I assume that's pretty good. In November I
was told what cars were coming in the early allocation, and asked if I
was interested (wasn't). I'm assuming some people dropped out, and I
might have climbed up the list. In mid-January I was asked to order my
car for a Feb/March build date and given the options list. I ordered my
car, and the order went through that month. 

The dealer gets a printout every Saturday from the computer at PAG that
gives them the status of the order. First your order number should show
up, then your build month (?) then a VIN # and completion date. If your
order is on it, at that point it's out of the dealer's hands. I check it
every second week and my order is on it. I was told to expect delivery
4-6 weeks after the completion date.  By the end of February, they
informed me that their allocations were lower than expected, and they've
only been receiving 5-6 cars/month. So far I've only gotten official
word that my car will be built in April, rather than Feb/March. Haven't
seen a completion date yet, or a VIN#. I checked with the dealer and
they've only delivered about 16 cars so far, and seem to be just as
anxious to sell it to me as I am to buy it.

Hope this helps, and good luck!!
