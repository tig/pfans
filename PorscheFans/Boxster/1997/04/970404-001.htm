Bruce,

I think these two emails (Jim's and mine) are fairly intelligent.  Jim
chose his subject poorly but these are not the ravings of overly religious
men. I was trying to suggest that: 

1. All Porsches are Porsches.
2. What truly represents "Porsche" to one person may not to another.
3. The 996 is not even close to a traditional 911.

I was not saying item 2 is a bad thing, just a true statement. Even if we
did this when the 911 came out, that was over 30 years ago.

Finally, I don't see how my email could start a religious war...
