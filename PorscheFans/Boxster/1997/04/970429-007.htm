Reading the postings for 4/28, I have the following comments.  

I have a silver and Boxster red car.  The leather dash is really well done,
though proves difficult to clean with vinyl protectant for the vinyl bits and
Lexol for the leather.  Needs some patience.  Zymol is my wax of choice.  Very
good stuff.  1600 miles on the car and no problems but an O2 sensor that went a
bit haywire.  Changed the oil at 750 miles during a PCA tech session and found
some little metal pieces.  Dealer said they would change at 2500 for free.  I
will be with the car when that happens and see if any more metal appear.  It
seemed nothing out of the ordinary for a new engine.  Mobil 1 of course.

I have visited the Techart web page as suggested by someone.  Great page.  I
e-mailed them and received indication overnight that their catalog is being
translated into English and will be available in about 3 weeks.  Suggest
everyone vist www.techart.de/homee.htm and take a look at the Boxster stuff.

On a more serious note, the issue of running the Boxster at PCA sanctioned
events looks problematic.  My region, Potomac, will address each Boxster on an
individual basis looking to see that driver's head with helmet is below both the
A pillar and roll bar.  Seems that there is a move afoot to required ADDITIONAL
roll protection.  Has anyone heard of a removable roll bar?  Has anyone had
experience in PCA sanctioned events where they were allowed or refused the
opportunity to run?  When I last brought this up, I got a reply from someone who
ran at Robeling Road.  Any others out there who believe the car is right for
track use as is?
