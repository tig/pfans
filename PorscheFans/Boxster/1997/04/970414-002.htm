Did you order any funky options?  Most of the early cars allocated for the
US came w/ Sport Package, floor mats, and that's it.  If you ordered
something else, it may take longer.  Check some of the invoice pages
(Berkeley has some and so does the www.scottsdalejag.com site - they
specify "if you order this, you'll wait an additional 3-6 months" or
whatever.

Subject:  Tracking an Order




I am still trying to get some infornation on wheather or not a dealer
allocation order can be tracked.  I am hearing about many of you that have
recieved your cars, yet who have not had a deposit on them as long as I
have.
 I happy that you all are enjoying you Boxsters.  However, I just want to
find out if my dealer is giving me the run around.  My deposit was made in
Dec. of 1995, and I was told that I would recieve my car in Jan/Feb 1997
time frame.  Just last week I recieved a fax from the dealer showing that
my car had just been ordered.  It gave a dealer req.# and a allocation date
of july.
  Anyone have any ideas???  And once the order is in, can it be tracked???
 Any information would be greatly appreciated.
                                          hayward
