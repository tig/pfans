     Hi PorscheFans,
     
     I'm in the June build allocation for a P64 Boxster, and as a 
     soon-to-be first time Porsche owner, I'm a little worried about the 
     rumors of Porsches being notoriously expensive to maintain/repair.
     There is no doubt that the car is beautiful and drives great, but if I 
     have to spend $1000 for a tuneup, it would be a drag.  People I talk 
     to also like to cast "doom and gloom" about how buying a first-year 
     car, about how the Boxster will be a temperamental little convertible 
     like an old MG, or expensive to maintain like their friend's 944.
     
     To all you current Boxster and other Porsche owners out there, what is 
     the real story on the affordability of Boxster or other Porsches' 
     maintenance and upkeep?
     
     Some questions:
     
     1) Isn't the 2-year warranty kind of short?  BMW has a 5 yr/50K one.
     2) Should we really believe that plugs last 30K or 60K?
     3) Should we really believe that the coolant never needs replacing?
     4) How often should one really change the oil and filter?
     5) What about changing oil immediately upon delivery or after 1K       
        miles?
     
     As a reality check, what are current Boxster owners paying for routine 
     maintenance?
     
     Thanks for any info,
