I am still trying to get some infornation on wheather or not a dealer
allocation order can be tracked.  I am hearing about many of you that have
recieved your cars, yet who have not had a deposit on them as long as I have.
 I happy that you all are enjoying you Boxsters.  However, I just want to
find out if my dealer is giving me the run around.  My deposit was made in
Dec. of 1995, and I was told that I would recieve my car in Jan/Feb 1997 time
frame.  Just last week I recieved a fax from the dealer showing that my car
had just been ordered.  It gave a dealer req.# and a allocation date of july.
  Anyone have any ideas???  And once the order is in, can it be tracked???
 Any information would be greatly appreciated.
