In response to Steve's comments below..

Yes, it is a 911, and I am assuming that the logic in the Boxster is 
similar but with 5 ratios instead of four.

In second gear on the 911 Tiptronic, there IS what you have called a 
"pause", and the explanation is that up to about 2500 RPM the transmission 
uses a fluid coupling, and then "locks" the gear ratio.  It almost feels 
like an extra gear change at that point.  Just prior to this shift, the 
engine is revving slightly above the speed that it does at the same road 
speed when "locked".  So you will observe a drop in engine speed at this 
moment, with a slight "surge" as the extra energy in the engine is 
translated to vehicle acceleration.

I feel the same thing sometimes in 3rd, but it is less obvious in the 
higher gear.  It may even do the same in 4th, but I have not bothered to 
concentrate enough to observe the effect.  It is not so obvious in auto 
mode, so the algorithm may be different.

I regard this behaviour as a GOOD thing, since it gives the needed 
compliance at low revs, and then acts like a manual above this threshold, 
presumably with greater efficiency.

I have two friends with Tiptronic 911s who have recommended the Tiptronic 
and one other who owns a manual but also recommended Tiptronic.  I do not 
know of any reliability problems, and I am keeping my fingers crossed.  I 
have also chosen to protect the car with a Porsche extended warranty.  
Mine has only done 10,000 km (6000 miles).

 I assume the tiptronic you have is on a 911.  I drove one today and never
expected to drive an automatic like that-amazing.

The one I drove, a demo with about 900 miles was VERY impressive.  The
saleman said it was normal after shifting accelerating into second and 
only
second for her to briefly pause.  Not very noticable but definately there 
on
that car.  

Do you know other people who have tiptronic?  Do they find them reliable?
 Can anyone tell me if the dealer in West Palm Beach Florida is well 
thought
of.  Thanks for reading this-any comments and thoughts would be most
appreciated.  steve
