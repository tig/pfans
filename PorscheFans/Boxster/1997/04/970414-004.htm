I don't know where you live, but of the bay area dealers I've used, there is a consistent picture: they can all show you a printout from Porsche NA that comes from a computerised system at Porsche AG.  The printout is updated each Saturday.  Your order number, your name and eventually your vehicle's VIN does not change throughout the manufacture and delivery process.  It's also possible to decipher the order information to confirm that your vehicle is exactly as you specified the order (colour, transmission, accessories.)  I ordered a Boxster in September and followed its progress week to week until it showed up, exactly as expected, the second week of January.  Even though the Boxster was a new proposition and there were trucking delays as the vehicles moved from East to West coast across North America, the process is visible from week to week.  I suggest you shake your dealer and contact Porsche NA directly if your dealer fails to show you the weekly printout.
