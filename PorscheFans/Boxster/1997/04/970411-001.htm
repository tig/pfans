Garry Hollett asked 
 
>> I also was told European delievery is out of the question. My question to
 you folks is:
 1. Is European delievery available starting September 1st?
 
Just within the past month, Porsche announced that Boxster European delivery
will be available beginning July 1. 

>>2. Dose it save you any money?

It used to. Not any more. Same price, I understand. You get to pick your car
up at the factory, maybe if you're lucky get factory tour, eat factory food,
drink factory beer, see factory museum, drive around Europe in your own car
instead of a superexpensive rental. For me, this would be a good deal even
for a week, maybe for a weekend. Last month, I asked a dealer about whether
you get a better price, he paused for a moment and said "We'll make you the
same deal for European delivery as for a car delivered here at the showroom."
(Read between the lines  -- "we'll make you a deal..." but that doesn't apply
to Boxsters yet, I suppose). 

>>3. Do floor mats really cost$261.00 a pair??? Don't they come with the car?

Well, you don't get a bare metal floor. Those are just added-on mats over the
regular carpet.

>>4. I ordered the exterior black, code A1, is this a clear coat? My dealer
 can't even answer this question.

It's not something he's lost any sleep over. Don't know if it's clear coat or
not. 

Berkeley Johnston also posted some good replies to the same questions. The
Grand Tour is a pretty good deal, and it doesn't get the publicity it
deserves. Dealers have no incentive to push it, since they sell the car
either way. Also it used to be that Euro delivery cars did not count toward a
dealer's allocation. Now they do, so they don't care where you pick it up. In
the old days, any car sold as Euro delivery was in addition to their
stateside allotment. The price was lower but then, even the smaller profit on
Euro delivery was pure gravy and didn't take away from anticipated stateside
deliveries. Now, they do, so dealers don't push Euro delivery.
