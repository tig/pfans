I have been trying to answer the same question.  Considering that $57K
will buy you some very nice cars.  Hell, you can buy a loaded BMW M3 for
$45K.
I've driven the Boxster several times and as much as I really love the
way the car looks, it feels under-powered, the pedal is always on the
floorboard.  Also, it bothers me that the interior is so poorly
finished.  Looking at the dealer demo car the flip lids on the vanity
mirrors had already broken.  The door pockets look REALLY CHEAP, I've
seen nicer interiors in the Honda Accord.  In terms of performance, I
can't help but think that the M3 out does the Boxter.  I welcome other
views, but I feel silly paying 57K for a car that looks cute but at the
margin under delivers and looks mangy inside.  I'm leaning towards
waiting to drive the new version (speculated to have a 3 liter engine)
before I commit.
