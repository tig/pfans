Troy Daniels wrote about his experience with the dealer insisting on adding a
thousand-dollar wax job to a Boxster. 

We all know you don't need anything like that. It's all just pure profit for
the dealer. They might as well sell the things with little $1000
evergreen-shaped vampire repellent hanging from the inside mirror ("they must
work, none of our customers have ever been bitten...")

I wrote a piece for the San Diego PCA magazine about how to negotiate with a
dealer on the car (basically, do your homework, look in Edmunds and find out
what he is really paying for the car, figure in the holdback, buy at the end
of a month or better yet a quarter or even between Christmas and New Year
when they might be desperate to make one last sale to meet quota.) One dealer
didn't like that article at all. His quote was "there's entirely too much
information on the Internet." (OK, we'll pass a law that if you know too
much, you can't buy a car, just as you can't serve on a jury.)

Anyway, Troy, try a different dealer. Try Anderson-Behel in San Jose. I've
heard good things about them. 

Also you might consider European delivery of the car. As of July 1 you can
pick up your Boxster there. Maybe that way the car won't be subjected to
"PermaScam" or whatever. I don't know if the cars are then shipped to the
selling dealer of whether you can pick them up elsewhere, Charleston SC
perhaps. Maybe the dealer will forget the Permaplate thing if you get Euro
delivery.
