Boxster Fans,

Reality check for me.... the Boxster looks real good but..... my Toyota Camry
has the same horsepower (-5 bhp) and is about the same weight (2800 lbs) as
the Boxster with tiptronic.  I love my Camry for getting from A to B in as
smooth a ride as most luxury cars... and in fact since acceleration is a
function of hpXweight or f=ma for you physicists, I can't see why people
think the Boxster is at all peppy... I think the Camry with the v6 is peppy
but I expect more from the Boxster....yes I know the Boxster outhandles the
Camry by alot!!!!  But how about the interior.... I dislike the
grainy/pebbley  vinyl so if I were to order I would get the full leather
interior but that costs $2000 more!  To be honest I've seen much better
appointed interiors in cars that cost much less... I know you pay for the
looks and handling.....

I've heard great reviews about the Boxster but I also hear, watch out for
first year Porsche production, you can get some great other cars for
$57,0000, my Boxster get outgunned by Mustangs, etc.... I know the Boxster is
a sports car, if I wanted to get a muscle car go elsewhere... but but... I do
want a muscular Boxster......that handles...

I think the Boxster has great potential, it certainly is great eye candy but
it needs a more powerful engine and I wish they would give us better
interiors w/o jacking the price up so much... I guess thats the price you pay
for a beautiful , great handling car... I bet the Boxster RS next year is at
least $5000 or more!!  So next year to pick up a RS but spend over $60,000
out the door????  Thats a close one to call.

Anybody agree, all opinions welcome....
Thanks....
