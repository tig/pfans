I just got (last week) my new Boxster. It came with the P63 Sport
package which, of course, has the in-dash CD player. I like to listen to
audio books during my commute, so I want to install the AM/FM Cassette
Radio and the CDR-3 changer. OK, now I've got the Becker changer and I
got the Becker AM/FM Cassette Radio. What I need to know is:

1) Is the harness pre-wired for the changer regardless of what options
were delivered?

2) Does everything just plug in and work or is there something else that
must be done?

3) What other hardware parts are required to effect the changeover?

If anyone could shed some light on how to do this, I sure be grateful.
Also, I'll soon have a nice Becker CDR-21 in-dash CD player for sale if
anyone is interested.
