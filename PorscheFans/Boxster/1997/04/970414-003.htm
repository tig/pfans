This past weekend I was in negotiations for a '97 Boxster. I contacted Sonnen
dealership in Marin county, San Rafael, Ca., and was told by the Sales
Manager that he had two slots for '97 Boxsters, one to be delivered in early
August (June production car) and the other in late August (July production
car). I told him what I had ordered for my November deposits, and he said I
could order that car with him. My order is the base car, 5 speed, sport
package, traction, hardtop, leather package, aluminum dials, alarm, etc...
grand total is the '97 MSRP of $50,367. (Dealer cost $43,485 and basically a
$7000 profit) Which is cool by me, the car is great and rare. He also wanted
to add Permaplate for another $1495... Well, I checked around, and a local
body shop would permaplate a new vehicle inside and outside for $300. I asked
not to except the permaplate and would pay full sticker at MSRP. He said "no
deal"...I then offered $1000.00 over MSRP without the permaplate...and his
reply was "Permaplate or nothing!".
I put together all my options on the car without any assistance from the
dealer, and basically wanted to pay full sticker for the car, plus $1000 over
MSRP. The Dealership would have made a $8000 PROFIT!! for the pre-written
order which they did not even write up or have to provide me with test drive
of the car. It's OUTRAGEOUS to make that much profit, wanting more money,
based on the rarity of production, turning the whole thing into a bidding
war.

It left a very bad impression about the "wheeling and dealing" for this car.
 I flew down to L.A. to the premiere. I've done my homework and research on
the car. It's disheartening that Porsche advertises this car as a "entry
level Porsche" and is aiming to attract new buyers, but doing just the
opposite at the dealerships...
I have two deposits at two alternate local Dealerships for a '98 Boxster due
to be delivered in late November '97. I decided to wait for those cars in
November and also gather more info on the 3.0 liter version that has begin to
leak out...

Down, but not out!
