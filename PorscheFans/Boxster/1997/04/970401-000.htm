>     NEW YORK CITY, March 26 /PRNewswire/ -- Porsche Cars North America, Inc.
> today presented to the U.S. market a line of child seats which will
> deactivate
> passenger side air bags on its 1997 and later model year sports cars
> including
> the complete 911 series and the new Boxster.
>           Created to address the concerns of child air bag safety in two-seat
> vehicles like the Boxster, the new Porsche child seats will both mechanically
> and electronically deactivate the passenger side air bag when properly
> installed on the front passenger seat.  The installation procedure involves
> the mounting of a special cross bar assembly to the front seat rail attaching
> bolts.  Included in this assembly are a cross bar buckle and two-pin
> connector.  The passenger side air bag is deactivated when the connector is
> plugged into the lead for the air bag control unit located under the
> passenger
> seat, and the child seat belt is inserted into the cross bar buckle.  When
> this process is completed, the system readiness is indicated to the driver
> via
> the blinking air bag warning lamp which blinks for 10 seconds after the
> ignition is turned on.
>           The new Porsche child seat line features three different seats
> designed
> for three occupant sizes based on body weight:  up to 22 lbs., 20 to 40 lbs.,
> and 37 to 100 lbs.  Each seat is equipped with its own safety belt system
> including the adapter which inserts into the cross bar buckle common to all
> three.
>           U.S. Porsche dealers will be selling and installing the new Porsche
> child
> seats beginning in May of this year.  While not yet finalized, pricing is
> expected to be competitive with premium seats currently being offered in the
> market.
