Jim,

As I have said before, all Porsches are "real" Porsches. The question is
what model or models say "Porsche" to you. For me, the 911 ('65 to '97) is
the model that gets me excited. The Boxter is just to new. I am not used
to it yet but it is a real Porsche!

The 996 will be a real Porsche as well. However, I think I will have a
hard time saying it is a real "911". There will too many things that are
different. The engine will be water-cooled and the body will be completely
different (no more classic 911 shape). From the latest pictures I have
seen, I will have no problem with the car from a asthetic point. In fact,
I will probably buy a 996 in 1999 or 2000 (that felt weird).
