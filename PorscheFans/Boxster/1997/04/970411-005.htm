Hey PoscheFans...

Porsche had some really cool reprints of old 550RS and 718 victory posters
(from Targa Florio, Mille Miliglia, etc.) hanging up in their display at
the LA Auto Show in January. Really nice old 50's illustration. I'm sure
someone out there must be putting out reprints of those. Anyone seen
anything like that out there? I've scoured the automobilia sites and turned
up nothing. Would look mighty fine in the living room (at my better half's
suggestion!! My GOD I'm a lucky man.)

We're in the process of 'decorating' (read cleaning up garage) in
anticipation of the new addition to the family (Silver/Red Boxster, Sport
Technic Pkg.) My February allocation has turned into an April build date,
thanks to the oft-discussed problems between PCNA and PAG. Looks like I'll
be waiting 'till June now for delivery. My dealer (Pioneer in San Diego)
has been strictly MSRP from the beginning, thank god, but they've had their
allocations cut from 10 to 5-6 a month nevertheless. I put my deposit down
last July, ordered early January, but the printouts still don't show a
completion date, which is a little worrying, despite the assurance that it
WILL be built this month. Any other San Diego people on this site have
exerience with Pioneer?

In any case, there are a few driving around my area already, and I am
JONESing everytime I see one on the road. I almost would rather not at this
point, it's driving me crazy! I've become addicted to this list, happy just
living vicariously through the daily scraps of second-hand experiences I
get from those lucky enough to have passed on to a higher plane... :^)

Okay, enough. I'll leave the pining for the Boxsterholics Anonymous
website. (Please don't send me requests for the URL!!)

---

Old business I never got a response to, in case there's any new information:

1) Does ANYONE know the model designation for the legendary SONY 6-CD
changer that's supposed to fit in the Boxster?

2) Has anyone been able to select the brand of tire shipped on their car?
If so, is there any concensus as to which is preferable?

In any case, thanks to the pioneers (Jim Dempsey, Andrew Potts, Paul
Schiemer et al...) for being the guinea pigs (Tough job, but somebody's
gotta...). Informed by their experiences, I feel much more prepared for
owning a first model year car.


Phil.
