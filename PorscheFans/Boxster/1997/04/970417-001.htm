Oh please.

Let's just give "Poor MonWong" a break and assume that his wife _prefers_
an automatic whereas he would prefer the stick, and leave it at that.

Subject:  MonWong, sexism in the 21st Century and Tiptronic




Judging by the straightforward responses to the Tiptronic part of the
question, no one else seems to have noticed the subtle sexism in
MonWong's question of 4.16 (...because I'm buying this car for my wife).
 Poor MonWong, the world is changing faster than he has seemed to
notice.  The 21st century is right around the corner and the latter half
of the 20th has been right interesting as well.
Considering that part of Porsche's target market for the Boxster are
women, I would assume that we will be seeing more and more of the poor
things trying to handle this manly automobile.  I'm assuming that this
will raise the question of whether a Boxster is a "real Porsche" when
its driven by a woman.

Regarding MonWong's Tiptronic question, let me repeat a thought sent to
this list some time ago:
"It strikes me as strange as to why one would want to pay a significant
quantity of hard earned for one of the most responsive and direct sports
cars in the world, then add such a complex set of directives from a
piece of equipment that is designed to emulate the effects you get
without buying it."
