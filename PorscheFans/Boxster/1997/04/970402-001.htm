Hey folks -

Test drove my first Boxster yesterday and I'm in love.  I'm kinda big for
the current generation of roadster (6' 2", 220#) so I wasn't expecting
comfort, but found the Boxster to be on par with its rivals, the Z3 and
SLK.  Found the response a little sluggish at low RPM but once in the power
band it performed nicely.

OK - enough of my (completely unqualified) opinions.  I'm just joining the
list so please forgive me if I ask a few dumb questions.  I looked back
through the archive, but couldn't find any answers, so here goes:

1.  Where can I look for a COMPLETE LIST of available options for the
Boxster?  I've got the 16-page dealers marketing guide, but what I'm
looking for is something that gives a little more detail about the
differences between the P17 and P18 packages, and what the hell is a Teknik
Sport Package?

I saw a partial list in this forum back in December 1996 (yes I looked back
that far), but I really need an up-to-date list, preferably with info on
proposed equipment and pricing changes for 1998 models, including the "S"
model.  I really think the Boxster would benefit from a slight boost in the
engine room, and the "S" spex I've seen so far look like just the thing -
what's it gonna cost me?

2.  Has anyone had any luck in LEASING a Boxster?  I'd be interested in
your experiences vis-a-vis the waiting period and whether you got exactly
what you wanted or had to settle.

3.  My dealer is telling me that the 1998 models will be delivered in
August.  I'm pretty sure this is BS.  Please advise as to turnaround time
should I place my order today.

Thanks in advance for your donations of expert knowledge.

Regards,

Brian M. Long
