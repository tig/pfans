Hi,

I heard from a few people who saw a boxster at an autocross
that it exhibited some weird behavior. They said that
coming off the start line from stopped with full throttle on
soft compound tires, the car shuddered and the
windshield and doors could be seen to flex a LOT -
like inches. I thought that the boxster platform was
supposed to be very stiff. Even my ancient flexi 911S
targa does not cause the doors to flex like that.

Anyone else notice this sort of behavior?

I know the car magazines tested these at the drag strips,
but it seems they don't release bad points about new cars.
I remember nearly buying a new Fiero 4 banger when all the
magazines raved on about them when they came out... (Hi Pete  ;-)   )

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S
