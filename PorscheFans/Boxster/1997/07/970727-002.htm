It's a Saturday morning, I'm driving along the main N/S drag in town.
At a traffic light I spy a silver Boxster coming toward me in the opposite
lanes.
[This is the second time in six months of ownership I have seen another
Boxster on the road.]
I flash my lights, nothing.
I wave, he looks, nothing - not even a smile.

Geeeeze....  what a snob, I think.

About a mile down the road I turn off into a neighborhood where my mothers'
house is.  I pull into her driveway and prepare to put the top up.
Then the guy in the silver car drives right by, coming from the opposite
direction.
I wave, he slows, I smile, he just stares, then drives away.

Hell yeah, he is a snob.

Of course, I'm a little weary of talking to strangers about my Boxster (it
NEVER fails you get conversations going almost everywhere), but this has to
be a new car (paper tag), and the guy could have at least waved.
I mean, he went to the trouble of turning around and tried to intersect my
path...

We had a big 'Ride & Drive' event at the local dealership one weekend, well
over a hundred attended.  
Local PCA chapter helped out.  Giveaways and such, even a cookout!  Loads of
fun.
I really enjoyed speaking with the two or three other folks who own Boxsters
though.  
That's what this whole thing is about, exchange.  You learn a lot, even if
it's obscure stuff like why they made the purchase in the first place. 
Although, I agree, not everyone has to subscribe or join just because they
own one.
The least you can do is wave or flash the lights...  don't you think??
[Or is that something just for 356 owners??]
