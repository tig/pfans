My dealer here in Charlotte is claiming 4 - 6 months for a tiptronic, 6
- 8 months for an manual.  Dale says the factory is placing the dealers
on a "option" allotment, and that he has to order a certain number of
cars with the tip, a certain amount with traction control, etc.  Keeping
his list straight has been tough.  Because of the option requirements,
he is having to skip over people on "the list" because they want certain
options, (or more accurately, because they don't want certain options).
Someone on this list suggested checking with your dealer to find out
what options they are being forced to take, and then place an order the
takes advantage of the current pressures from the factory.

Cheers, RC
