Hi everybody,
I still think that you should change the oil after the break-in, no matter
what the maual says.  You are going to get debris/metal  in the beginning
so you should change the oil, unles you want these particles.
Even if newer engines claim that they get rid of these, it doesn't hurt,
right?  why risk it? No?

Alberto.

PS. what's up with the recent message bombarding?  this guy is so rude he
doesn't even apologize.
