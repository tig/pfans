First of all, let me contribute a status report from another early
Boxster owner.  After two months of driving the car (2500 miles) I am
totally pleased and satisfied.  What an incredible car!  T

The car is silver with the red leather interior, CD changer, and sport
package with 17-in wheels.  Handling is superb, I can't imagine
wanting a stiffer ride except for the track.  The only problem I've
had is a broken cable from the driver's side inside door handle to the
lock and the dealer took car of that right away, so no big deal.  The
other thing is that even at my moderate 5'11" height I find that my
right leg is always resting up against the center console; it seems
that Porsche could have avoided this by simply moving the pedals to
the left a bit, but I find that I'm starting to get used to that and
don't notice it for more than an instant any more.  

One of the things I admire most is that there are tons of electronic
gadgets on this car, but they are so well integrated that they aren't
the center of attention, they're merely useful and no more.  The
cooling and heating system is very effective.  The sound from the
stereo system is great, even at high speeds with the top down.  The
quiet water-cooled engine is a real change after years of listening to
the air-cooled engine in my 912 (almost too quiet!).  I love the color
combination and receive an unending stream of admiring comments about
the car and the color scheme.

Which brings me to my question.

What is "paint preservative"???  On page 117 of the Driver's manual
Porsche writes the following:

	The paintwork contains certain oils which maintain its high
	luster and prevent it from becoming brittle.  Climatic
	influences can remove these oils from the paintwork.  This
	should be counteracted by applying a paint preservative early
	enough to restore the oils preserving the high luster ....

"Oils", in the paint?  This is the first time I've ever heard of paint
being described in this way.  And instead of wax, it is suggested that
"paint preservative" be used to "restore the oils".  What's the deal?
Is this some type of new wonder-paint that needs all new treatment, or
is "paint preservative" just a fancy name for wax?
