     Has anyone thought about trying to put a lightweight hitch 
     on a Boxster?  I would like to do so, in order to be able to 
     tow a tire trailer for AutoX events.
     
     I have contacted Da'Lan Hitches, and also Hitchmasters.  
     Hitchmasters would use Da'Lan they told me.  I currently 
     have a date to drop the Boxster off and have one fitted.
     
     It is a challenge.  There isn't much in the way of structure 
     back there, and right under the rear trunk is the exhaust.  
     The pipes come out in the center, right where you would 
     expect a receiver.
     
     Da'Lan is confident that they can do a custom hitch (which 
     will also be available to others after I have paid the 
     development fee) which should be invisible if not in use, 
     and adequate to tow a 750# trailer with about 100# tongue 
     weight (good for carrying bicycles, too).  Might have to use 
     asbestos gloves to install/detach if the muffler is hot, but 
     they seem to know what they are doing.
     
     I certainly would like to hear from anyone who has done any 
     thinking or research on this subject.
