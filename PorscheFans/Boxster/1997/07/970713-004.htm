     BPFans:
     
     Just heard from my PDealer that my Boxster Lies Over the Ocean, left 
     Europe on July 3.  Due in the first week in August, only 9 months from 
     placing the order.
     
     Now to get ready, I need to know some more about boomerangs.  I recall 
     reading about them protecting some sensitive areas of the front.  What 
     does it protect? How much are they? and who carries them?  How about 
     bras.
     
     Speaking of accessories, has anyone heard of the mythical cartop 
     carrier?  Has it gone the way of special colors?  Is there a third 
     party supplier someplace (I assume the receivers for the carrier are 
     still incorporated into the body.
     
     TIA
