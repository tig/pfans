Guten tag from Deutschland!  This is my first posting to PorscheFans. 
I'm fortunate enough to be stationed with the US Air Force in Germany,
but even around here Boxsters are still a relative rarity.  This was not
the case on a recent trip to see the factory in Stuttgart, however.  But
while there, I was told by a dealer that the long-rumored Boxster S will
ABSOLUTELY not be produced as a '98 model, and quite possibly not even
as a '99 model.  Has anyone else received any definitive word on this? 
This is straight from one of the largest dealerships in Stuttgart, and
I'm not even a potential customer of theirs (hence no incentive for them
to mislead me into signing up for a Boxster now rather than waiting), as
I'll be placing my order through an American agent who deals with the US
military here.  I've kinda decided I don't need a Boxster S, but thought
the rest of you might want to know.  Or maybe you all know this already
from prior discussions in this forum . . . .

Thought I'd also ask if anyone has seen a Boxster with both a red
leather interior AND exterior -- seems to me that would be just a little
too much red, but I'd be interested to know if anyone's actually seen
such a combo, and what they thought of it.  I definitely plan to get a
Boxster red interior, but haven't yet decided on an exterior color. 
Silver of course looks great, but then that's what almost everyone seems
to be getting, and Guards Red looks really good too.  Any advice?

Eric Nelson
