NOTE: The following story contains my own impressions
      of an incident which occurred yesterday at
      Michael Porsche of Fresno.  Others may have a
      different impression of these events, but I 
      believe that my perception and memory are 
      accurate.  All quotes are approximate, giving
      my impression of conveyed meaning, but not
      necessarily exact verbiage.  Judge the story 
      for yourself.


(Please pardon the rambling narrative.  I'm irritated and
writing fast.)

So, on Friday, my friend is informed about a car available 
at Michael Porsche of Fresno.  He calls down there, and 
talks about the car with them.  He asks about the color, the 
price, whether it has a hardtop or the sport package, etc., 
and they tell him, and he also explicitly asks if he's 
paying retail, to which the dealer's response is something 
like "Well, we'll have to check on the options, but yes." 
(This should have been our first clue, but we didn't pick 
up on it, my friend assuming that they were referring to the
fact that options would up the price of the car over base.) 
so he decides to go down and buy the car.  

Sooo, we drive down from San Francisco to Fresno, and when
we get there the car looks great, but it has a hardtop, 
contrary to what the dealer had said on the phone, and which 
my friend doesn't want, but it's ok, because they say they've 
already sold the hardtop to someone else, so he couldn't have 
it anyway.  He of course says "So, this needs to be removed 
from the price then." or something similar, to which the 
salesman replies, yes, of course. 

So, he drives the car, comes back, and starts filling out the
paperwork.  Nearing the end of the paperwork, he looks at the 
price, and realizes the hardtop hasn't been subtracted from 
the sticker price, even though he has already signed a due 
bill which says the hardtop is being removed, and $2240 removed 
from the price.  So he says, "Hey, wait, the hardtop is still 
in here, this needs to be corrected." and the salesman replies, 
"Oh no, you're paying that over MSRP."  which is not what he'd 
said only a few minutes earlier.  Now the fun begins.  My
friend says "Hey, I asked explicitly about this on the phone, 
and you didn't say I was paying over retail, and PCNA would not
be happy to hear that you are charing over MSRP for the cars." 
and the salesman says something like "Well, we're just charging 
what the market will bear, I quoted you the price for the car 
on the phone."  My friend replies with something like, "Well, 
you know, I asked explicitly if I was paying retail on the phone, 
and you didn't say that.  Now, if you'd told me before I drove 
four hours to get down here, then I would have considered it, 
and might have bought the car.  But now I feel I've been misled, 
and can't buy the car from you."  

At this point, the gears in my brain are turning fast, and I 
realize that what they are doing is taking the hardtop off the 
car, and selling it, and then selling the stripped car for the 
original price, for the specific reason that it does not appear 
that they are selling the car for over sticker, and that PCNA 
will then not treat them as a price gouger.  It also occurs to 
me that my friend had explicitly asked if that was going to be 
removed from the price when he walked in, and they replied that 
it was, and then tried to slip it in on the sales sheet without 
him noticing.  So my friend says this is unacceptable, and we 
prepare to leave, and at this point the manager starts talking, 
and my friend says it is not acceptable for you to be charging 
me for a parts I'm not getting, and the manager replies with 
something like "No, you're not paying for the hardtop you're 
not getting, you're just paying four thousand over MSRP."  
(Which didn't make sense, even in context - the hardtop was
only $2240, so I was wondering whether he was making a mistake
or if they might have slipped in something else.)

We then start to walk out, and the manager says, "Ok, wait,
I understand how you're feeling, ... <snip out assorted bs> ...
we'll give you the car for MSRP."  My friend considers this, 
but he had told me before we walked in not to let him buy
the car if it's not just right, so I tell him "No, these people 
have already behaved in a dishonest, deceptive, and underhanded 
manner, and once someone has @!#$ed you, you can't trust them 
not to do it again, and by going ahead with the deal anyway, 
you also encourage them to continue these practices."  

So we leave, and then at the gas station we realize we don't 
want them having signed paperwork, so we go back, and ask for 
the paperwork back.  They are now acting very nervous,
obviously aware of the potential problem they have created.
They say they don't want us feeling bad or angry leaving the
dealership, that they don't want any bad word on the street 
about them, etc., and ask him whether he will consider paying
MSRP for the car, or what it would take to get him to take
the car.  (At this point, they are clearly upset, and it occurs
to me that they might even take _under_ MSRP for the car, just
to get him to take it and not tell his story to PCNA, other
dealers in the area, and everyone else he knows.)  They are
trying hard to get him to take it, but he won't, and I wouldn't
have let let him even if he were willing, and we get all the 
paperwork voided, and leave for good.


I personally feel that the implications of this story are:

1. They misled us into coming there but not answering
   honestly when he asked on the phone before coming if he 
   would be paying a premium.

2. They tried to slip in the price of the hardtop without
   him noticing, after he had explicitly asked if it would 
   be removed, and the salesman had replied that it would.

   This is like reading your bill at a restaurant and 
   finding out they triend to charge you double for your 
   meal.  I don't want to have to check my my bill with
   a fine toothed comb to make sure the dealer isn't trying
   to overcharge me without me noticing!

3. The dealer is removing and selling options from cars, (or
   at least hardtops) and then selling the cars for the 
   original sticker, with the effect of appearing to sell 
   cars for MSRP, when they are really extracting a premium.  
   They are doing this in a way which conceals the fact from 
   both PCNA and customers who don't notice.

In sum, my impression is that Michael Porsche in Fresno is
using very deceptive sales practices, and I would warn you to
watch out before doing business with them.
