Greg And Janice,

I had similar problems when I got my car, it took two people pulling on
the handle slots to get the top engaged, what I did was left it up for a
while, including a week where I was out of the country and now (two
months later) it closes no problem, you still can't reach up and flip
the latch forward what I do is put the hook into it's hole with by thumb
and then flip the latch forward and it all works great!

As for the gutter problem I also had this one and the dealer "adjusted"
the roof and it now works fine, I quote the adjusted because what it
involved was wacking the bar with a hammer and a soft faced striker to
bend it in. Now it works just great! 

I love the car! But one question for the rest of you, has anyone figured
out where the Performance Floor mats are supposed to clip in?

Subject: Rag top closing problems

Hi all,    (RE: Rag top clsing problems)
I've seen the posts over the past couple months re: various rag top
closing prolems, I have it, and thought I'ld see if there's any common
thread on these. 
The probem I have is the one where in the last 3-4 seconds of the close
the bottom edge of the top does not fall into the side gutter but rather
falls on the inside of the gutter(above & behind each side window)
The car came w/the Hard Top and had numerous 'X' options. That plus an
couple extra weeks @ PDI/Charleston meant the Rag Top was'nt put up to 
stretch & break-in until at least 2-3 months after construction.
When I picked it up we couldn't even get it stretched forward far enough
to engage the latch.
 
So, for those of you that have experienced this problem, does any of
this sound familiar? (ie. any relationship bet. gutter probs.& cars
shipped w/hard tops, delays, etc). Thanks in advance for your input.    
                                       Gregg
