A different twist on this issue.  I've been talking to my local dealer
about the status of the 996.  This past weekend he confirmed that
Porsche will produce about 3 months worth of '98 993's at the current
price tag this fall. (So much for those who bought a '97 thinking it was
the last of the breed).  The 996 will start in 2nd qtr '97, with coupes
and cabs coming next year, and turbos and targas coming as 2000 ('00?)
models. (Does this mesh with info others have, I thought the turbos and
targas were just a year behind, which would badge them as '99?) He said
he expects a minor price increase for the 996.  Anyway, when asked about
the deposit list and waiting time for '996, he said he has three
deposits for the '98s, two coupes and a cab, and three for the '00
Turbos.  If the wait for the Boxster S goes long and the bonus gods are
kind this January, I may take a look at a 996 cab.  Does anybody have
access to any interior photos of the 996, all I have seen are the
external spy shots and an offical exterior shot of the coupe that my
dealer received from Prosche last week.

Cheers, RC
