At the recent DE held by Wild Rose (a tiny little region in Canada), I bring 2 perspectives. I was the organizer 
and the only Boxster owner. After consultation with the professional driving school I hired, we allowed 
Speedsters, Targas, Cabs and the Boxster as is. Maybe our DE is more sedate than other regions (we have 
lots of newbies), but we only had 2 spins, and nothing resembling an 'incident'.
