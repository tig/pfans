With regards to the guy who didn't flash his lights, a friend of mine
used to say "never attribute to malice what can be adequetely ascribed
to stupidity or ignorance."

My guess is that the guy doesn't know the "secret code" of flashing
lights at each other. Usually when someone flashes their lights at you
it is to:
	o warn you of a speed trap
	o let you know something is wrong with your vehicle
	o alternative to honking the horn
	o indicate you forgot where your wiper switch was ;-)

My guess is the guy wasn't a snob, he just didn't know. That's
probably why he turned around. He thought he must have not realized
who it was flashing at him and tried to be nice and come back to see
if it was someone he knew. He probably thought you were trying to pick
him up ;-)
