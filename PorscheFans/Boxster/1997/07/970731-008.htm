Here's some information that may be usefull to anyone interested in changing
the factory sound systems in all the 96, 97, porsche models, here's what I
discovered, I have a 96, 911 with the factory in dash cassette player and the
remote CD player, and I wanted to replace the cassette player with an in dash
CD player, so I checked out the dealer price for the factory Becker unit and
It was extremely high, so I decided not to change it, untill I came across an
advertisment in EXCELLENCE magazine for a company selling the same Becker
part no. as the factory unit at 1/2 the price!!, so needless to say I bought
it and just plugged it in, no hassle no fuss, this co. offers all the same
factory units, CD changers included. The only difference is there is a Becker
logo on the face instead of Porsche, which is hardly a compromise to original
equipment, even to an originality wennie like me. sorry I don't have all the
information on the co. with me now but the name is SW stereo, somwhere back
East .please E me and I will send  you the phone no.as soon as I
can...........Jump2xs@aol.com
