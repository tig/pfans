Hello Porsche Fans.

I am the new editor of Car Audio and Electronics, worldwide, the number 1
magazine covering mobile electronics.  

Each month we feature four to five audio installations and in both our July
issue (currently on newsstands) and in August, we have multi-page color photo
features on systems installed in 911s.  Both really stretch the audio
envelope.

Although I realize that these modifications are not really everyone's cup of
tea, they are very innovative.  In the feature coming up in our August issue,
the owner/installer relocated the clutch pedal to accomodate a 10-inch
mid-woofer in the driver's footwell.  It is a 1974 911 Carrera with more than
100,000 miles on the clock and is powered by a 300 HP RUF-modified engine.

If you own a vehicle (and non-Porsches submissions are welcome) with an
interesting audio system, please feel free to contact me.  At CA&E, we are
always looking for noteworthy vehicles.  As editor, I like to give preference
to vehicles that are daily drivers that exhibit innovation and attention to
detail in their installations.  I am looking right now for someone who has
done or is planning a high-end system in the Boxster.

Look forward to hearing from many of you and hope that this message is not
considered spam.
