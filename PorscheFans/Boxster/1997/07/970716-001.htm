I have a similar problem.  I park in a NY City garage and bought the
cover to protect the car form the dust but more importantly, to ensure
the attendants do not more the car from where I park it.  I bought a car
cover from the dealership when I picked up the car for $190.  Supposed
to be made for the Boxster and it has the Porsche Logo on the front.
The "ears" fit nicely on the side view mirrors.  Quite happy, but the
cover is not fully lined in the inside with "soft" material - so there
may be some better covers out there for more $$$. Has anyone bought this
cover - is it a good one?  (it's my first one).

I ordered the steel sill plates but then accepted delivery of someone
else's car that did not include them.  I considered adding them as a
dealer installed option but they wanted a full 24 hrs to install them,
and I didn't like the idea of waiting another day.  Since them I have
been too busy, but have noticed that it is quite easy to scuff the paint
on the door sills with one's shoes getting in and out of the car (also
the trunk and bonnet release levers have taken a beating).  Assuming
they can be removed without damaging the paint in the future, I think
they make sense and will probably end up having them installed.  My bias
is towards the steel rather than the carbon.
