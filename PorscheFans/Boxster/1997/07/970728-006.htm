While we do business all over the country, we're based in Fresno, CA.  As
such your note on the local Fresno Porsche dealership really caught our eye.

We have a good working relationship with the factory, and have the
opportunity to speak directly with senior management on various issues.
Your situation certainly sounds like something that should be pursued.
However, in order to do this we need a couple of things from you.

1.  The names of the salesperson and the manager you referred to.
2.  The name of the friend you were at the dealership with.
3.  Does your friend still want the car?  Is he turned off Porsches or just
Porsches sold by Michael?
4.  Some way to contact you other than email.  I suspect the factory might
want to talk to your friend directly as well.  If you like, skip this and
we'll ask you for it directly once an inquiry gets to that stage.

If privacy is an issue for you, respond to me directly by phone or email
(although that would cut the P-Fans out of the loop.  After that godawful
GPR business everyone is probably looking for a new topic to chew on).
