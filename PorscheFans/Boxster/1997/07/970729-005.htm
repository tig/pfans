P-Fans and Mark,


    I have notices many  people are ordering options that are available
as accessories, e.g the XLA tail pipe, floor mats, Shifter/Brake, CD
changer, and entry gaurds (sills).  Are they aware of the acutal price
they are paying for these options?  They are all available for much less
($395 factory vs  $290 mail order for the XLA) than the factory via mail
oreder!! . Additional price differences comes for the 8%  Luxury Tax,
and depending on the state, the Sale Tax and licencing fees. Also,
options  increase the value of the car for the Tax assessor, therefore
you pay each year for them!!!  Why pay so much more for the same thing?

My recommendation to those of you ordering cars, look at all the
available accessories, see what you can get and order it  not from the
factory, but get it from a dealer via mail order. I have a few dealers
that I have dealt with that I would be glad to recommend in private
e-mail.

All but the Shifter and Brake handle are easily installed!  No unusual
tools are required!
