As someone who details their car after evey drive, I've finally  become
proficient at cleaning the rear window - but it took several months to get it
right. 

First, the wax.  After using several products I feel the best is "Plexus" (it
was originally used on aircraft windshields).  It can be ordered through
Proformanace Products 1 800 423-3173.

Second, the cloth.  I only use Gerber diapers on my car (over my wife's and
nine-month-old's objections).   I later learned that many of the best
detailers use the same.

Third, techinque.  Spray the diaper, not the plastic windshield and do NOT
let dry.  Work in the wax while going in one direction (up and down or
sideways).   The problem, as many of you already know, is streaking - no
matter how carfully you rub. The key is using a clean cloth, only wiping
once.  If you go over a clean section with a cloth with wax on it , it will
simply streak up again.   I will sometimes use ten diapers (that's 20 fresh
sides)  to get the window clean.   But when I'm done, it's better than
showroom condition - not a streak, not a spot, not a mark. 

The time?  Allow a good 15 to 20 minutes.

If anyone has found any easier or shorter ways to keep the window in mint
condition let us know...
