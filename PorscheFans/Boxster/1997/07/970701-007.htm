Glad to see someone enjoying autocrossing their Boxster! I autocrossed
mine for the first time at the Porsche Parade in San Antonio last month
and believe it will be a very competitive car right out of the "box" so
to speak. Concerning the wheel and tire combination IMHO unless you will
be running very tight courses where you need to keep the RPM up in the
powerband (smaller wheel/tires act like a final "lower gear") the only
advantage might be lower pricing - for the wheels and tires. If you
evolve to running faster driver education and time trial events that
many PCA regions host you're going to want the larger wheel tire combo.
The R1's are a good choice - I'd stick with the racing compound vs
autocross compound unless you get very competive. 

Technic Sport Pkg. - My car is so equipped, but I would not recommend it
unless you're a serious "trackie". After purchasing my car I had the
pleasure of driving it 1600 miles home in a 3 day period and found
myself praying for smooth interstate! This isn't whining from being use
to driving a "soft car", my regular "rides" are a Jeep Cherokee with
beefed up suspension and a 944 Turbo that has been set up for the track
(lowered and stiffer springs, Koni sport adj shocks, bigger sway bars,
hard busings, etc). However, since then I seem not to notice it as much
- the roads are better and it seems the dealer may have inflated the
tires too much because after changing tires and rims to set up my track
tires and reinstalling the street tires with the recommended pressures I
haven't noticed it as much (but then I haven't been in it for 8 hours at
a time on bad roads either). Still I stick to my initial opinion - and
then "serious trackies" will end up "improving " on Porsche's bits with
dedicated aftermarket pieces anyway (I' ve already got an order in for
new springs to lower it 1.5". 
Have fun.
