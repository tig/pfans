Hi everyone,

I'm interested in ordering a new Boxster (who isn't?), however I had some=
 basic questions since no one in my immediate area has one.

I understand the Boxster has fairly decent leg room, but I was curious how=
 comfortable the car is in general. Now to put this in perspective...  The=
 Miata is uncomfortable, but the Z3 is not.  I currently have a 96 Mustang=
 Cobra which beyond lack of leg room is plenty spacious.  I realize this is=
 a small car, but they don't detail interior dimensions at all in the=
 Boxster brochure or other documentation.  Is it comfortable or do you sit=
 in one position, and that one position alone?

Although I plan on at least sitting in one before I put anything down on an=
 order, I wanted to find out what others thought before I wasted anymore=
 time on it.

Thanks in advance for any feedback.
