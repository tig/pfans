i. STEREO

I listened to the upgraded system and it is good-very good.  Bass is a tad
muddy and high end nice but not very crisp. The Becker unit seemed to user
unfriendly although I assume with time it would be OK. I originally ordered
the 6 speaker upgrade with in-dash CD but have deleted it. 

I will have a local place (Boca Raton) that has already worked on
approximately 8 Boxsters install a fine sytem for $700-1000.  Basically we're
talking in-dash CD, power amp, replace dash speakers, but woofer or
mid-woofers in doors, and a subwoofer in passenger door.  They can install a
CD changer for much less than Porsche charges.  Several companies are coming
out with units or cables that can mate with the Becker in-dash cassette.

ii.  ABD

I live in Florida --a good deal of rain; obviously no snow--and am wondering
whether the active brake differential is necessary and/or worth $1000.  I've
been driving without it for years.  What is your, the Boxster owners',
opinions?  

Thanks,  

Jim         {black/black, sport classic wheels, due... Oct (?)}
