Thanks to all who e-mailed and posted on the subject of "how long to wait"
for delivery once my dealer informed me that my car was at PDI as of July
9th.

The responses ranged (the seven I have gotten in the past 24hrs) from seven
days to two weeks insofar as people's actual experiences.  One West Coast car
was at PDI on June 25th and delivered to the other side of the country by
July 2.  Impressive!

As impressive was the terrific response I received - some loaded with
additional info.
Porschefiles are indeed special.

One additional request; I want to buy a car cover for the Boxster to use in
the garage.  The garage gets a good deal of dust from a source I am not sure
of and I would like to protect the car as best as possible.  Have ordered a
catalog from Automation in Sunnyvale, CA, but if there are any other
suggestions, they would be appreciated.

My sincere thanks!
