Hi, Bob,

If you read the latest Excellence (October 1997), there is an article about
the Boxster on the track at Sears Point.

The author (David Colman) made the following comment:

"Only the height of the rollbar provided by Porsche is problematic. If
you're under 5'9" tall, as I am, then you'll
be able to position the driver's seat low enough to sit under the rollbar by
half-an-inch when you've got your
helmet on. That clearance wa enough for the tech folks at Golden Gate to
give their blessing to the integral Boxster rollbar,
especially since the stock unit is made of stainless steel and tied into the
perimeter frame of the survival cell
with hefty fore and aft braces. But anyone with an extended upper torso, or
height greater than 5'9", will have a
tough time convincing tech inspectors to let them onto a track when they're
sitting higher than the roll hoop"

Personally, I have not seen a picture of a Boxster without the driver's head
extended above the roll hoop.

My vote is for safety, and requiring a real rollbar that extends at least
two inches above both the driver's helmet
and the passenger's helmet.

I also happen to have been the instigator of this particular requirement in
Zone 1.

Subject: Boxter at DEW



Our group, Rennsport Region, part of zone 1 is having a lively debate
about making the stock Boxter elegible for DEW.  Apparently Zone 4
allows them as does NER.

At the moment Zone 1 does not allow them without an aftermarket
roll bar.

Given the success of the Boxter there is a lot of pressure from
owners to attend DEW and few opf them are prepared to install an
additional roll bar. I can't blame them, the aftermarket bars are
really ugly and the car is ill designed to have one fitted. Besides,
Porsche built the car with roll bars at the factory!

The concerns expressed are two:

1) Is the factory roll bar system strong enough to withstand a high
speed roll-over?

2) The factory bars are relatively low. What happend to a helmeted
driver of 6 foot or more whose helmet is higher than the factory bar?

I recognize that PCA tends to err on the conservative side. I also
suspect that PCA does not take the factory's advice on such matters
too seriously, witness the requirement for the 993 Targa to have a
bar initially an then allowed without one.

Having attended the Exec. meeting of the Rennsport Region, I promised
to use the power of the list to seek an answer.

Thos in favor of allowing stock Boxters say:

    Meets German roll over standards which are much more rigorous
than DOT.

    Boxters drive on the Autobahn at high speeds and must resist a
high speed roll-over.



    NER has investigated and are satisfied.

Those against say:

    We don't know that the boxter is safe in a high speed roll over.
The 993 Cab is not.

    We are concerned because taller people end up with their helmet
above the roll bar, this assumed to have nasty consequences if the
car rolls.

Guys, Bruce, Pete A, does anyone have some (hopefully) factory
supported facts to inject into this lively argument which seems
largely based on hearsay?

I hope this will be resolved in favor of the Boxter because to
maintain our growth, PCA needs those guys out on the track.

Bob

(who does not own a boxter, rather a pair of 993 coupes)
