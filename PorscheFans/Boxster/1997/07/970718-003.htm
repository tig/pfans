Well, I was worried about this special color
problem, since the Boxster I ordered was Speed
Yellow, not only that, it has a painted instrument =

panel as well.  With this in mind, I marched over to =

my dealer to get a status report.  =


Surprise!!! My car was shipped on the 14th of July and I =

expect to have it in my eager little hands two weeks after =

that.

Conclusion: I don't know what the rumors about a =

discontinuation of special colors is about, but my =

dealer says  if the order was accepted by PAG
it should be filled, and mine is on the way to prove it!!!

Saludos,
Carlos
