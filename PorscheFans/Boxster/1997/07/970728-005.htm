I'm going to jump in to the fray because the Suncoast (Florida) region is
currently going through the same discussion. My wife is the DE registrar,
so I get to handle and negotiate many of these types of problems.

Before Parade, I asked our Zone rep to raise this issue at the national
board meeting. She did, and the reply was that it was going to have to be
handled on a region by region basis.

The Safety chairman and Chief Track Instructor have decided to allow them
to run in Suncoast DE events. Our rationale is that we let 914's and
Targa's run, and the roll over protection in those cars is not as good as
the Boxster (it may be higher, but not stronger). Furthermore, we have
allowed structurally sound bars that do not cover the top of the helmet in
Cabs for some time.

Club racing is a different issue altogether, and anyone that intends to
race a Boxster should probably get a full cage anyway.

I do think it would be a good idea if someone from each region that
conducts DE events would respond to this string and let everyone know what
their region is going to do with this issue, along with your rationale.
Maybe we can get a consensus.

Mike
