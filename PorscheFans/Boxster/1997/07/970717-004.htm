Caught a small piece of wood (form a gardener's truck) on the freeway.  It
really screwed up the underside of my front bumper.  No other damamge, thank
g-d.   I didn't realize how close to the ground the thing is. 
 
Bumper cover... $526.25

Paint, removal, and put-back ....$675

Time in shop - 3 to 4 days.

The really stuipd part is that I had checked out that boomerang thing that's
been mentioned on the list.  I figured it was B.S. - a waste of 300 bucks.  I
described the thing to the body shop and they said it probably would have
avoided most of the damage.  Stupid me.  I just ordered one to put on my new
bumper.
  
By the way, the bumper is really flimsy - you can even bend it with your
hand.  I'm thinking the reason is weight...
