i'm not sure how many of you have seen my page regarding pag's decision 
to no longer offer the special order colors for the boxster.  if you 
haven't, the gist of it is this: if you don't have your speed yellow, 
forest green, polar silver, or ocean jade boxster (there're some others 
as well) in your driveway today, you're not going to.  that is, unless 
we can rally and show pag/pcna that these are viable options that people 
want.  i realize that not everybody wants a special color (probably in 
no small part due the the fact it's a little spendy) but i know there 
are people out there ordering these colors besides me.  part of the 
problem (according to our dealer) is that orders aren't placed with pag 
except on a quarterly basis, so they don't see anything except one 
quarter's worth of special options/colors.  and to date people have been 
ordering examples of cars they've seen, which have all been the standard 
colors.  so, while there might be plenty of people branching out (as 
boxsters become more readily available) and ordering special colors in 
downstream allotment quarters (e.g. those of us expecting a car late 
'97, early '98 and beyond), they (pag) haven't yet seen these requests.  
and they haven't seen enough special color orders to date to warrant 
continuation of production (so as it stands sterling has quite the rare 
boxster :-)  so while any of the colors are fairly unique today (given 
that there are so few boxsters on the roads) any color boxster looks 
great today (at least to me :-).  however, eventually the "common" 
colors are going to become ubiquitous because they're the only choices 
we'll have.  it'd be nice to make sure we have choices moving forward.  

and don't forget - pag will listen if we make our voices heard (it 
wasn't too long ago you a single top color and no beige interior...)
