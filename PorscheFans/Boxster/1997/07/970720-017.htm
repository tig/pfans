RE: Where to get boomerang, Sarah 7/20
             Ogner Porsche 818-884-4411 or at least I think so, thats the 
# in some archives, its in their any number of times, don't have my file 
here.
RE: Porsche please another 1/2", Barry.  I've lowered mine back to approx 
euro height (down 1-1 1/2) and not hitting anything.  Got to use some 
care, that nose is way out there, take any dip down or up at the most 
angle you can. That soft material the nose is made of is excellent for 
withstanding stones w/o chips but gets ground up fast in the pavement. I 
hope my stainless boomerang never hits the street but if it does I'ld 
expect it would provide a small amount of skid action and save some 
chewed up plastic, structurally it's not fastened to anything (but the 
ABS) and if you took a real big hit under there, it may not save you, 
then again it would spread force over a wider area. Your big ticket stuff 
(the radiators) are immeadiately above left and right corners. Use some 
care, brake well before you hit the dip(so your nose isn't diving from 
braking) and some dips can't even be negotiated with a severe angle, I 
back up now and the and go another way. It's a small price to pay for 
having such a beatiful car, right?     Gregg  84 944
