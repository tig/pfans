The July 11 Boxster list contained some information about the 996 which seems
to conflict with what Fred Schwab, PCNA CEO, said at the Porsche Parade. Mr.
Schwab spoke at the National Board Meeting (as he always does) and was asked
when we would see the 996. He said that he was not permitted to answer
questions about the car just yet. But, he said that air-cooled production
would cease on December 1, 1997. He said that one could logically answer the
question from that info. He also said that recent spy shots in the various
magazines were "very accurate."  Additionally, he said that there would be a
run of 993's, really '97's to be called '98's, to fill in the gap before the
new car starts production. He did not say that there would be a 6 month gap
in "911" production and it doesn't make much sense when you think about it.
Not every Porsche customer wants a Boxster, after all.  Other sources have
said that Cab production starts in the spring with the Turbo to follow in
1999, perhaps as a '00 model. Targas, of course, are history.

At the Boxster tech session held later in the week, I took the opportunity to
corner him privately and do some complaining about the lack of choice in
interior colors. I told him that I thought the tan interior was particularly
disgusting. He freely agreed and compared the color to a substance that I
shall not mention here. He said that interior colors are controlled by a Frau
somebody-or-other and that he could make no headway changing anything. I
suggested that perhaps Porsche might send all their cars across town to
Sindelfingen for interior installation where a little more variety is
available. Not to mention higher quality at a lower price. As an example, I
paid $1600 for a full leather interior including door panels and the backs of
the seats in my C280.

For some more photos of the 996 including one of the dashboard ( very
Boxsterish) taken through the right door, check out the June 13 issue of Auto
Motor und Sport. It also shows a side view comparison of the dimensions of
the Boxster, 993, and 996.
