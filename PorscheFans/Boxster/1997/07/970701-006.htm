Guys,

Don't have it yet, but my P38 equipped Boxster was at PDI as of last week,
so I'm expecting it within the next two. I'll give you a report then. Had
the same concerns as you when ordering, but I figured California roads were
forgiving enough, and sacrificing a little comfort for performance didn't
seem a bad tradeoff. Drove a basic (16" equipped) car before ordering in
January (for the 'how long?' thread, you can calculate out my $0.02 on that
subject) and it seemed plenty stiff, but was comfortable enough that it
could give up a little ride without becoming punishing. The aesthetic value
of it being lowered 10mm can't hurt either, though I'll be looking hard at
that 'Boomerang'.

-Phil.
