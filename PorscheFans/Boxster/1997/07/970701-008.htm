Just my $0.02. 

I have a silver boxster, manual, with the sports
suspension, 17in wheels. I have only spent a day or two in the
normally suspended boxster. The sports suspension definitely
makes the car tighter and a good degree stiffer. I have just 
finished a trip from Vancouver to San Francisco. I went down
the I5 and back up the 101. A total of approx. 2000 miles. I find
that the suspension helps at speed as well as in the corners. I
spent the majority of the time on the I5 at speeds in excess of 120mph
with the top down. The car could not be upset by imperfections in the
Interstate. Through the mountain passes in southern Oregon I had
the opportunity to try the car in some high speed sweepers. I am still
in awe. I ran out of confidence long before the car began to complain.
The brakes were nothing less than supernatural. We arrived in San Fran
a little burned, wind blown, and with a huge grin, in 11 hours. The way
back up the 101 is a traditional winding coast highway. Again the car
was having a ball of a time and so was I. All I can say is the stiff
suspension has its draw backs. I am sure that my car will exhibit rattles
sooner and I am still wondering if it will affect the top at all. But if
you live in an area that has decent roads and you want to use this
car as it was intended you won't be sorry by ordering the sports suspension.
It represents a very small degradation in day to day driving comfort and
only on the
worst of roads does it feel like a compromise.

I have had my car for 1 month. I have put 8000km (in think that's about
4500 mi?)
of happy, safe, fast mileage on the car. This is the most fun I have ever
had in a
car and the sports suspension is a part of the fun. Why brake, just crank
the wheel
and have a ball!

I am off to drive the Sea to Sky.. for those of you in the Northwest I'll
see you
there.

Scott.
