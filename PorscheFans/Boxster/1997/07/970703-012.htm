I got my 986 on May 29 (dealer would have broken my neck if I hadn't
beat the end of month thing) <<with>> the p38. NO complaints on our
lousy Pennsylvania roads. It's definitely NOT too stiff. As others have
said, in a city like NYC, the potholes would jar you but on average
roads, the improved handling is worth it imho.

Has anybody suffered from the airbag warning light staying on? My dealer
says it is usually caused by dirt on the contact in the seat belt
receptor. They hooked it up to the computer and the light when off. Go
figure.  After a mere 1,000 miles the car is almost as good as S.X.

Although not currently discussed (probably due to the weather, the
hardtop is a beautiful addition. If anyone is considering 4 season
usage, I commend it. Also full leather option is a handsome addition if
cost is acceptable.

A final disconnected comment, has anyone noticed the airstop is
ineffective? Maybe my height takes me aboe the windshield but what
little hair I have left gets awfully tussled.

Have a great 4th and drive.
