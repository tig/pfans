     Pfans,
     
        As I recall, in an early issue of Psychology Today (early to mid 
     70s) there was a report on a study done at a California University on 
     the tendency for certain car colors to attract law enforcement 
     attention.   A red and other colored (I believe blue) VW beetle were 
     driven around predefined routes by a set of students.  (Routes cars 
     and students were all switched around in a systematic fashion).  The 
     results were that the red bugs were stopped and sited significantly 
     more times than the other colored bugs.  (I seem to recall that it 
     might have been twice as often).  
     
        So . . ..   Despite the protestations from a trooper in a recent 
     Excellence article, that they don't go after any colors more than 
     others, it seems that at least red is not a very good color for those 
     who don't want to attract too much unwanted attention.
