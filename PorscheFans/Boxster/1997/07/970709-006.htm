Hello All.

Not a busy morning so thought I'd weigh in on this whole red/yellow thing,
since like everyone else I wasted some time in undergrad psyche classes and
now feel qualified to make judgements on this kind of thing <g>:

Red I understand.  Blood is red.  Red is therefore a very important color
and the when the eye picks it up, very primitive parts of the brain pay a
great deal of attention to it, in a "fight or flight" reaction.  Hence the
choice of the color red for stop lights, fire trucks, and certain women's
dresses.

Bright yellow, on the other hand, is just an odd color that doesn't occur
naturally very often and therefore attracts attention in a "wow, what's
that?" kinda way.  Bright (neon) Greens, Purples, Blues and Pinks work this
way, too.

Subject: Red/yellow and Porsche yellows

Speed yellow is darker or brighter than pastel yellow.  It is costs extra.
 Pastel yellow is a standard color at no extra charge.

I recall from my neurophysiology lectures that the eye is most sensitive to
perceiving yellow and then red.   This research may be supported by or
coincidental with the fact that fire trucks are red or yellow.   Anyway,
cops are more likely to notice these colors....

However, I do believe this is secondary to choosing a color.   I'd just get
the color that you love the most. Period.
