Hey Tanda,

When the top is closed, if you run your hand along the inside edge above
the window, there is a rubber/ cloth strap which appears to attach the top
to the frame.  A couple times I have noticed this getting caught as the top
closes, so the rubber actually sticks outside the frame on the outside of
the car.  Today after putting the top back up, the strap has completely
ripped off at the rubber base.

My March delivered car has started to do the same thing, causing wind noise
at speed. It hasn't ripped the strap or rubber off yet though I wondered if
that would be a fix. Seen any down-side of it being gone? I thought about
either removing it or trying to glue it into a position that wouldn't allow
it to hang in the frame. Has anyone talked to Porsche about this?
BTW got my 2nd letter and airbag stickers from PCNA  today. How  did they
know I didn't put them on the first time?!
