Mark, have PAG also dropped the 'colour to sample' option? Maybe they have decided that anybody who 
REALLY wants a non-standard colour will pay for that option. Also, are we really the target buyer? When the 
Boxster was being first discussed, it was the younger buyer (they like the gloss black buttons right?) and 
women they were after (Please, no flames. I'm trying to paraphrase them. My SO likes BRG/Tan XKE 
Drop-heads!) I'm more 'traditional' and happen to love the look of a BRG/Tan Miata! Or Red/Black or 
Orange/black, etc.
