     I am interested in knowing what you did, and how well it 
     worked out.

I have used it to tow to Sebring this past month and it worked fine.  I am
towing a small trailer I built that holds 4 tires and  large box  to hold the
tools and jack. (42"x42") The trailer does not weigh over 150 pounds with
every thing on it.  Remove the rubber bumpers, 2 allen bolts, and the hitch
attaches to the aluminum supports.  It uses the existing holes and requires
an additional hole to be drilled in the vertical face the aluminum support on
each side. (not seen when the bumpers are put back on.  
The lighting connections are standard hock up.  Although Porsche says you can
not connect any more consumables to the electrical system, I called them and
they said they saw no reason why it would not work.  The hitch takes all of 5
minutes to install or remove.  It weighs about 3 pounds without the ball. 
I have had this trailer for some time towing behind my 911. It is the only
way to travel to a track event.   I could make you one if u are interested.
