I have two comments on this topic.  Firstly, I often drive my 
bright red Nissan NX2000 at fairly high speeds while commuting, 
and have not received a ticket (or even been pulled over) in 
over six years.  (Knock gently on wood.)  Ditto my bright red 
VFR750.  Of course, neither of these is a Porsche, which may
attract more attention, but I honestly believe that if you 
drive very quickly, rather than just a little over the limit, 
you are much harder to ticket, because it's very obvious when 
someone is following or catching up to you, and you can slow 
down.  (Of course, I'm also always on the lookout for police, 
and always drive with a Valentine One.)

Secondly, I once asked a highway patrolman if he wrote more
tickets to red cars, or if they were more noticable, and he
replied that in fact the opposite was true.  I guess people
with red cars are more sensitive to the presence of police
or something, because he didn't say why, but said that he
didn't need to pull bright red sports cars over very often.
They're probably usually smart enough to slow down for 
police...
