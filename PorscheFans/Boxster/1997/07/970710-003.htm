that's a good point - i, too, have heard rumors that the wait could be 
extended 3-6 months for a special color.  i still hope that people who 
have ordered special colors will respond.  

from a personal standpoint, while i could understand not offering viola 
metallic, as popular as dark green is for sports cars (miatas, z3's, and 
corvettes all spring to mind) i am a little surprised that porsche isn't 
going to offer this color.
