I'm 6'1" also and haven't had any problems with the manual although my
right leg does tend to rest against the console.

I have the wind deflector in my car and have heard others say it does
little good. I plan to take it out and see what kind of difference there
is.  With it in there does seem to be quite a bit of buffeting.  If there=

isn't any difference I'm going to leave it out.

Is the top closing problem something that is evident in the beginning or
does the problem develop with time?  I took delivery of my Boxster a week=

ago and haven't had a problem....yet.

I haven't had a chance to jack up and crawl under the car yet.  Does anyo=
ne
know how accessible the oil filter is?  Anything special in this car abou=
t
changing/draining oil?
