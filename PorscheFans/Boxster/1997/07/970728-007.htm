> Re: My Experience at Michael Porsche of Fresno

You are not alone.  I have been dealing with 5 different dealers in
Washington and Oregon to help my chances of getting the car I want.  Most of
the dealers have been really honest and true to me - they are the ones who
will get my sale and return business.  One or two of the Porsche dealers have
just been over-paid used car sales people - anything for a buck.  I really
don't know how these places stay in business, but people just seem to keep
coming in and buying cars.  Some of my bad experiences have been...

I've been lied to numerous times and led to believe things that weren't true.
 I've been told that I could have cars that were already sold, or that didn't
even exist.  I've been promised dates that were 9 months off, just so I would
join their list and give them a deposit.

Some of the dealers constantly bad-mouth the other dealers and even other
sales people at their own dealership.  I actually had two sales people argue
right in front of me for 5 minutes as to which one of them saw me first. 
They finally agreed to split their commission for me - now neither one of
them is interested in even talking to me.

A couple dealers often sell top positions on their lists for $500 to $2000. 
Some of the sales people have actually buddied up with me and admitted it,
like I'm supposed to think that is cool that my slot just fell one position. 
Other dealers have denied it, but then I get calls from car brokers who tell
me they just bought a top position from the dealer and they are ready to
place an order for a delivery date that is just a couple months away.

One of the dealers purposely buy cars under false names (or real people who
don't want a car).  When the car comes in, they call me with this story about
how someone couldn't afford it, and it is for immediate sell for $10k over
MSRP.  When I say "Isn't that against Porsche policy to mark up the price?",
they claim it is not because it was an abandoned sale and the dealer is free
to charge whatever they want.  At first I brushed it off as no big deal, but
I now realize that they are doing this 1 to 2 times a month.

Not all dealers have been this bad.  I have found a few I like and I am
sticking with them.  I am really glad I decided to work with more than one
dealer from the start.  I can play them against each other, and I don't have
to take crap from any of them.  The dealer who I trusted most at first turned
out to be the biggest fraud in the end - too bad they are the one closest to
me.  With the demand for a Boxster being so high, many of the dealers are
abusing that demand because they know the customers will always be there,
even if they screw over a few of them.

This is my first Porsche, and I really expected more respect from someone who
I am about to give $60k of my money.  I'm sure this mail can be countered
with thousands of happy customer experience mails, but people should look out
for who they are dealing with and always question the dealer's intentions.
