I originally posted this question to readers about 6 weeks ago. I am now
happy to report I took delivery of my boxster on Thursday, July 24th. I
placed my order on January 6th.

My only gripe was a "dealer prep" charge of $900! When I asked why this was
so high I was told "that what we are charging on boxster, end of story".

Just curious if others had the same experience.

Also, on the sports package option, I specified chrome wheels. I was rather
surprised that this was a $2400 option! The last two cars I purchased
(Mercedes & Range Rover), the option was only $600.

Think they are ripping me off?
