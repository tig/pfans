Hey Steve-

Thought I'd pitch in my $0.02.

I was seriously considering the P38 option too, but then I read something
that turned me off.  I don't remember where I read this, but I do remember
reading that the Technic package is _mighty_stiff_, and that unless you're
a serious lateral-g-force fanatic, you really don't want this option.

I've driven the regular-suspension version and it was pretty taught.  On
the city streets here in Manhattan I could definitely feel the texture of
the pavement.  I'm guessing that the P38 option, if used for everyday
driving on city streets, will rattle your fillings loose.  If you're
looking for a rally car, OTTH, it might be just the thing.

Anyone out there got a P38 they would like to talk about with us?

Regards,
-bml

Subject: How stiff is the Technic package?

I am looking at ordering the 17" wheels (M396) and the traction control
(P37).  I can save $400 if I just buy Technic Sport package (P38) which
includes the 17" wheels and traction control.  My only concern is how the
tighter suspension that comes with P38 will effect the car.  Is it to stiff
for everyday driving?  From my test drives, it seems that the stock
suspension is firm enough for most people.
