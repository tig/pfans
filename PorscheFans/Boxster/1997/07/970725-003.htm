OK, folks. Here's the definitive word on what exactly is required to
install a hardop onto a car that didn't come with one. After searching
around, I finally had an already painted hardtop shipped to me from the
same dealership where I bought my car (Walter's Porsche in Riverside,
CA). It seems one of their owners didn't want the hardtop that came with
his Arctic Silver Boxster so I was the big winner. It arrived in great
shape. This is when I discovered the truth about installing a hardtop.

In addition to the hardtop, you're going to need 4 additional parts. The
reason you can't get them from the original owner of the top will become
clear as you read on. The parts are:

1 ea 986-563-713-02   Left-side bayonet insert
1 ea 986-563-714-02   Right-side bayonet insert
2 ea 999-219-041-00   Allen-head bolts

The parts will run you between $50 and $75 bucks depending on who you're
dealing with. Why there's is such a variation in price is anybody's
guess. I sure don't know. I guess some dealers mark up their parts more
than others.

Once you've got the parts in hand, you're either going to have to put it
in the shop or prepare to tread onto dangerous ground. 

The installation of the inserts is simple enough. You simply remove the
plastic inserts that are in the tube where the hardtop attaches and
insert the new bayonet inserts. It's really important that you align
them properly ensuring that you have the left insert on the left side
and the right insert on the right side. In addition, there apparently is
a way they must be aligned in the tube. The longtitudinal axis of the
slot must run parallel with the longtitudinal axis of the car, that is,
the slot must run front-to-back. In addition, the insert must be
positioned in such a way as to allow the bolt to clear when it's put in
to secure the insert.
 
You're now ready to install the bolts. NOW, you've got the problem
which, heretofore, has not been fully explained.
There is almost zero clearance between the place where the bolt goes and
the convertible top mechanism. As a result, there is absolutely NO WAY
to get the bolt into where it needs to go to secure the bayonet inserts
unless you disassemble the convertible top mechanism. And this, my
friends, is where the alleged 4 hours of labor comes in. I tried
installing the bolts with the top up, with the top down, and all points
in between. The pivot point for the top is immediately adjacent to where
the
bolt has to go. Unless I remove it, I'm not going to be able to get the
bolts in. 

Frankly, this is not a job I'm willing to undertake at this point, so
I'm going to have it done at my local dealership when I have my 7500
mile service.  And because getting them out of a car that had a hardtop
that the owner no longer wants requires the same 4 hours of labor, I'd
strongly suggest just ordering the parts and leaving the topless owner
with his old, useless inserts.

Anyway, that is the whole story of what has to happen.
