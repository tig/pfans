I have my boxster for a week, and here are my observations.  I invite
comment or feedback from all:
P38 Technic suspension offers me no ride problems or comprimises on even
rough pavement.
Top: I have same problems as others who have posted here, with the top
not seating in the channel when raised w/o maunual assistance. Comparing
tops with another boxster of feb build (mine is may), I find different
teathering in the offending area.  Anybody know why Porsche made this
change?  Can anyone post a suscinct solution?

Front end is too low.  Scraped that underpan-bumber first time I went up
my driveway.  Now I go up at an angle to avoid problem.  Porsche: Please
give us an extra 1/2 inch clearance here.  Will Boomerrang help this?

Ordered "Boxster"=A0mats (w/proper code), received "Porsche".  No big
deal, but why not what I ordered?

Alarm and central locking instructions needlessly complex and include
features a sportcar owner does not need (I think!).

Driver's side defrost vent always discharges air (never closed, even
when system is "off".) 
Result:=A0In high humidity, condensation forms on outside of windshield
on driver's side, necessitating use of wipers!  Is this normal?  Anyone
else experience this??

any otyer comments/communication appreciated.

Barry
