     Hi all,
     
     My Ocean Blue Boxster is also at PDI and I am awaiting the trucking 
     schedule for delivery out to Palo Alto, California.
     
     Now that there's more people receiving their Boxsters in recent weeks 
     and months, what's the current popular thinking on buying an extended 
     warranty?  I know this issue was discussed on this list some months 
     back, but I haven't seen anyone write about it recently.
     
     Carlsen Porsche in Palo Alto is offering the following extended 
     warranty:
     
     Offered by Ordesco, Inc., which is a member of the Old Republic 
     Insurance Group.
     
     5 years/75,000 miles
     $50 deductible
     Bumper-to-bumper plan
     Simultaneous with factory warranty
     Transferable
     $50 if vehicle requires towing due to failure of covered part
     $40/day rental car
     $50/day for three days-meals & lodging if more than 100 mi from home
     
     Exceptions:
     Adj. & cleaning, battery & cables, belts & hoses, brakes,
     exhaust system (incl. cat. conv), filters, fluids (some exceptions),
     lights (bulbs, sealed beam & lenses), lubricants, manual clutch disc,
     shock absorbers, spark plugs & wires, squeaks & rattles, tries,
     tune-ups, wheel balancing & alignment, wiper blades, coolant, wheel 
     studs, door & window handles, recommended maintenance services, 
     components & equipment not installed by manufacturer.
     
     
     $1236.00 (at time of car purchase)
     
     
     What do y'all think?  Is it a good deal?  What have others gotten?
     
     Thanks,
     
     Andrew
