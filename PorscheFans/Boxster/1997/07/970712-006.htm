Mark and P-Fans,

I also noted the 986/996 on the blue covers for the front of the cars as
they go down the assembly line. Of even further note is that almost all
the parts in the front of the Boxster have part numbers on them begining
with "996"!  I still beleive the Boxster is a derivative of the 996, i.e
the 996 was designed FIRST, and the Boxster taken from it. It makes good
marketing sence to introduce the lower prices product (986) before the
more expensive one (996). I case you are wondering about the number 986
being before 996 and thus "should" have been first, remember, the 928
was far into developement before the 924 was EVER proposed!

Also the post by Perci on the "decoding" of the VIN is wrong. He has the
right data but has mismatched the "value" the corresponding letter of
number. The only difference in the Valmet and the Stuttgart car's VIN
will be the Letter "S" after ...980VS..  That is the production site,
i.e. Stuttgart!

My VIN is: WPOCA2980VS622933

WPO  THe world manufacturer's code for Porsche
C: USA code for body
A: USA code for engine type
2: USA code for restraint type
98: in combination with the 12th digit for model, i.e. "986"
0: USA number code
V: model year
S: Production site, Stuttgart (will change for the Valmet cars)
6: In combination with 7th and 8th digit "986"
22933:  serial number, (first digit =>code for the body)
.
