While I have been reading the list, I have not contributed.  Some thougths on my
car now that it is 4 months old.

I have had only one recurring problem with a balky oxygen sensor.  Both sensors
for banks 4-6 have been replaced and that seems to have solved the problem.  The
check engine light would come on after a couple of hours at relatively sane
highway speeds.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?  

Two weekends ago, I did a one day drivers ed at Summit Point near DC.  After
some tentative laps, I got down to business.  Places that I could not put my 944
Turbo were easily had in the Boxster.  Used stock brake pads that coated the
rotors.  Does anyone have opinions about after market pads for this car.  Cool
carbons, performance friction, what?  There is part of the track that was very
scary in my turbo, off camber down the chute to a hard left hander.  The
instructor had me going down to that corner, flat out.  Thecar is neutral, quick
and the brakes are phenomenal.  I am still trying to get the turbo lag out of my
right foot.  Got to drive this car differently.  I would like to hear what folks
have to say about running with and without traction control.  At one point on
the track, it was clear that the car was being slowed by the electronic brain,
but that brain was helpful in other areas.

The looks even get stares here in jaded DC.
