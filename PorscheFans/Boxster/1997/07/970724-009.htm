In my last message I reported on a potenitally serious noise in my new Boxster
engine.  My assumption was a lifter problem.  The dealership changed the oil and
filter to be sure that is wasn't an oiling problem, but the noise persisted.  I
spoke with the dealer today to learn that Porsche will not allow any dealers to
make significant repairs to the internal workings of the engine.  Looks like a
new engine will be ordered and installed.  The dealer has said that Porsche
wants to tear the engines down in Germany to look at the problems and see if any
fixes need to be engineered.

I am concerned about matching the new engine number with the cardex numbers
listed for my car.  Seems like Porshce needs to make accommodation for
maintaining the integrity of the serial number issued from the factory.

Will keep all of you posted.
