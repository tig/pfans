My $00.02....

I drove tip and manual.  The manual was a lot of fun.  The tip is
entertaining and great when you pull up to a light and just stop and relax
without having to shift into neutral.  I heard the tip adjusts to your
driving style and can be "pseudo-programmed" by depressing the throttle 3x
before you pull away for a more aggressive driving style.  I think there may
be a learning curve to get the most out of the tip.  People who have it seem
to love it.  I have ordered the manual because I enjoy working the car a
little more.  Check back in a few months after commuting in the car and we'll
see if I eat those last words.

Sport package: Don't know about the Boxster but the 993 4S was stiffer than
the 993.  The Boxsters I drove were fine.

Leg room: I'm 6'2" and leg room is tolerable but not great. Headroom is
great...especially with the top down.

Wheels: I ordered the sport classic 17" which look like the 18" sport classic
II available for the 993 but without the bolts on the periphery of the rims.

Finnish vs German:  Who knows about any difference in quality.  I guess a
German car might have higher resale value for reasons that may not be sound
but will nevertheless exist.  Finnish production is said to start in Feb.  I
will take that as meaning March-April.

Black/black, wheels as above, windstop, manual...aftermarket stereo to follow
Car due ....around 3-5 months
