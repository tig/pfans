RE: Eds post on topclosing, oil/filter location

    Top closing: My guess, and from all the feedback I've gotten,
is                  that if you didn't have the problem from the get-go,
                 you won't see it, and if you did, it may go away by
                 itself over time.
    Oil/Oil filter: Don't know how you're going to do it w/a jack Ed,
                 not to say it isn't possible. I've lowered my car
and                  everything is pretty cozy under there. Drain plug
is
                 dead center under block and is a recessed aluminum
                 allen wrench jobee, looking very much like screws
                 from up-top the 944 engine. Look under car and
site                  across from front edge of rear wheel arches, thats
it.                  Filter, which is just an element (like the old
days),                   sits in a plastic-like can and screws up (w/new
O ring)                  just behind and to the left of the drain plug.
Torque                  wrench w/Porsche rec. tightness should be
                 used for both but common sence might be substituted.
                 (oh yeh, the hot 9 qts comes out pretty fast)
