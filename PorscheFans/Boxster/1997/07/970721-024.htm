What a fantastic two weeks! I took delivery of my 986 on July 4 after an
extensive tour of both Weissach and Zuffenhausen. All of the 14
participants were picking up Boxsters... and all silver but one. My wife
and I spent two weeks on both big and little roads all over Germany,
Austria, and Switzerland.

I've got a big load of info in this head-thing of mine that I'm dying to
upload to the collective Boxster mind. I'm tired from the trip and from
my first day back at work, though. So I'll be brief and hope some of the
info will generate discussion.

Boxster "S" - Saw a prototype on the test track at Weissach. Same body,
different engine. Lots of instrumentation wires in the cockpit. Porsche
is still testing the proposed changes, so nothing is set in stone.

996 - Identical front-end and doors as the 986. Different top and rear.
Just a few were driving around Zuffenhausen when we arrived (saw two or
three and got some pictures). MANY were visible two weeks later. It
seemed like every other car out of the factory (and into the streets of
Stuttgart for initial road testing) was a 996. Saw a right-hand-drive
blacked-out 996 on the autobahn... catching him was hopeless.

Valmut Boxsters - Cars are already coming out of Valmut to Stuttgart for
final production testing. Identical parts (all from Zuffenhausen), only
assembled in Finland. Valmut production will last only until
Zuffenhausen can meet the demand (about two years). Real production
begins after the August break. There is no way to predict or to choose
which car will be delivered to you. It sounds like most, but not all,
Valmut cars will go to the U.S.

No problems with the top. Up and down many times per day for two weeks.

The alarm system *description* is complex, the option itself is cool.
Forget the alarm... it's the key-button locking/unlocking feature that's
so sweet.

The Wind Deflector totally works. We tried with and without. I'm 5'10'',
my wife is 5'2" (eyes of blue). "Don't go over 200 kph without it."

Ice-cream in the front, pizza (not white Mosel wine) in the rear.

German boarder guards are a little up-tight. Front and rear trunk
carpets ripped out and mostly put back.

Break-in period - U.S. manual says 1000 miles, German manual says 1000
kilometers. You pick. The official answer to the break-in question was,
"Follow the instructions exactly." then the unofficial answer was (1)
make sure you have oil and that (2) the engine is warmed up. Keep the
engine under load, but vary the engine speed. Red-line is OK, but vary
the engine speed.

German 911 drivers never acknowledge the Boxster. Other Boxster owners
are excited to see another Boxster.

Technic Suspension package is great, especially at speed (I topped out
at 151 mph from Trier to Koblenz). My wife thought it was a little
stiff, but we were in the car a lot... over 2100 miles. Shorter
distances would not be a problem. Slightly stiffer than my Mercury Sable
Wagon.

Hair get tangled at over 200 kph.

More later.
