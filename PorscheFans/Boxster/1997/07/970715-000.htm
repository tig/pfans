     I am afraid to get too excited, but my dealer in VA has told me that 
     my Boxster (Silver/Black) has arrived in Charleston at the "PDI"  on 
     July 9th.
     
     He says "about two weeks" delivery and Porsche says "2 to 4 weeks" 
     from arrival at "PDI".  Can anyone share their experience - insofar as 
     time you waited - once the car hits this stage of the delivery cycle?
