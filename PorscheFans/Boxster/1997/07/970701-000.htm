Hi all!  I'm new to the list as of just now.  Today I ordered a
Boxster at Anderson-Behel Imports in San Jose, with a $1000 deposit.
The wait is a year, but I figure it's worth it, and they actually
had a car for me to test drive.  (A friend of mine ordered his
without even _sitting_ in one.  I couldn't believe it.) The car I
ordered is Arena Red Metallic with:

    Black Full Leather Interior
    Sport Touring Package
    Soft Look (supple) leather seats
    Tiptronic
    Traction Control
    Power Seats
    Heated Seats
    Active Carbon Air Filter
    Parking Assist
    and the neat little Porsche crest wheel center covers.

I have a few question about things I didn't order though, and was
hoping some list members might have the answers.

  Do the "Special Leather" packages cover more surfaces in leather
  than the regular full leather option?  The pictures of the special
  red in the brochure seem to have more leather than the one I drove,
  which had the graphite grey full leather.  Also, on the subject of
  the leather, the interior I saw had noticable white stiching in the
  door, which does not appear in the "special" leather model in the
  brochure.  Is this a difference, or does the special leather have
  seams which were airbrushed out of the pictures?  Does anyone have
  a black leather interior, and if so, do they use black thread in
  the seams?

  Do the stiffer springs/shocks and thicker roll bars of the Sport
  Technic package significantly affect handling (positively), or ride
  quality (negatively)?  This is especially to anyone who has ridden
  in cars with both.  I was going to order this package, and piecemeal
  together the components of the Sport Touring package, but the salesman

  told me he'd driven both, and that the Sport Technic package wasn't
  really necessary or worth it.  (I then asked about Autocross, and he
  said, well, yes, if you're going to autocross the car then it's not a
  bad idea, but even then not really necessary.)

  Has anyone driven both a Tiptronic and a manual, and have any comments

  on the difference?

  Does anyone know what the Parking Assist option actually does?  I was
  assuming it beeps when you're a certain distance from the curb, or
some
  such thing?

  Do people assign any weight to the idea that a Finnish built car will
  be worth less than a German built one?

TIA, and I look forward to hearing from everyone about their experiences

with this amazing automobile, a new beginning for our favorite marque!

                                                       Jim
