     I know that all of you other Boxster owners have had the 
     experience of all of the stares, smiles and "thumbs up" when 
     passing people on the highway.
     
     Today I took a friend in my Boxster to take delivery of his 
     new Boxster.  Both are artic silver with Boxster Red leather 
     interior.  After he got his car, we drove down Route 128 
     (we're from the Boston area) following each other at times, 
     and at other times, side by side.  
     
     People always think its a treat to see one Boxster.  This 
     trip really grabbed a lot of attention.
     
     In addition, I got a chance to again see how nice the car 
     looks going down the highway.  Boy, I love that car!!
