at our dealer you can't really "sell" your position (i don't know if 
that's what you're interested in doing) - if you decide not to buy then 
either somebody else moves into that quarter's allotment and gets a car 
a little earlier, or else, if the car's been built, the car will be 
offered to each person on the current waiting list until somebody buys 
it.  imho, the reputable dealers will try to prevent people from taking 
advantage of the boxster's popularity and making money on the car.  i'm 
guessing you could make more if you take delivery of the car then turn 
around and sell it (based on the markup at a dealer in texas i saw).
