Okay people...

Hate too bring up this subject again, but I'm rapidly approaching my
break-in point (surpassed it if you go by the german manual - see Berkley's
post 7/21).

What is the popular wisdom on changing oil after 1000 mile break-in?
Originally I had heared that it was to clear any metal shavings that may
have been in the engine block. However, the Boxster engine is somewhat
unique in having the oil channels cast into the engine, rather than
machined out. Would that suggest that  machining debris is no longer an
issue, hence Porsche's claim that no oil change is necessary after break-in?

Don't want to initiate the great oil change debate again, but would like
your opinions.
