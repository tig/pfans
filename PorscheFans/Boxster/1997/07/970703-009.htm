My God.

I just sat in my car at the dealership. Still has to go through dealer
prep, detailing etc.(interior was pretty dirty) so I'll be picking it up
tomorrow, just in time for the long weekend. Oh, heavens, I'm not going to
sleep a wink tonight.

Going to give it the full once-over and test drive before I plunk down my
life savings :-) Anyone have any suggestions of what I should look out for?
It's silver, Boxster red, P38 w/alu shifter/brake, alarm and windstop. So
far all I've seen at a cursory glance is a nasty leather blemish (sort of
like a pucker) on the driver's side door. Time to put the warranty to work!
If anyone can share things they wish they'd noticed before leaving the
dealership, I'd appreciate it.

P.S. It may be ridiculously expensive, but I highly recommend the
aluminum/leather brake & shifter option (Y06)- feels great, and makes the
interior look amazing. Sacrificed the CD player to fit it in my budget, but
definitely no regrets. (My professional recommendation as an (ex) auto
designer ;-)

Sleepless in San Diego,
-Phil.
