So I've had it for three days now (Zenith blue/blk/17"/hardtop/TC). Its
reallyan impressive machine. Like everyone else, its been worth the wait. The
top thing hasn't happened despite being shipped with hardtop. It was a little
tough to latch the top the first few times, but that seems to be resolving
already. Its been fun exploring the car and finding out a lot of its little
"secrets"--storage places, displays etc. I didn't get the computer but I must
admit it looks preety cool in the handbook. Only glitch: driver side window
inoperable with top down. 

Highs: fit and finish inclding luster of paint; engine sound and response;
stereo; fun factor; ease of operation of top; waterproofing of top when
washed (totally dry in 10 sec with towel)

Lows: window; every fingerprint shows with this color; incredible amount of
breakdust; draws guys like flys;waiting for break-in period to exceed 4000
rpm.

I haven't calculated gas consumption yet, but seems thirsty esp with AC on.
What is experience? Can't wait to drive to work tomorrow.
