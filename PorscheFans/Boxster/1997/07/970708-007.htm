PorscheFans...

Picked up my car at 3:30pm on the fourth of July, just in time for a great
long weekend. Unfortunately had a convention to go to on saturday, so
really didn't have any cartime until sunday, when my girlfriend & I took it
up to Julian. After hitting my first 280 miles, I am happy to report the
car is PERFECT (though would I be considered ungrateful for hoping for a
little more low-end torque, say between 2500-3500 rpm? Plan on downshifting
to pass before the double yellow...).

Highland Valley Road is one of the best driving roads in the San Diego
area, a 20+ mile stretch of narrow winding hilly switchbacks through
farmland from the I15 to Ramona, well maintained with beautiful fresh
blacktop, with narry a cop in sight. At Nissan Design it was our favorite
road to try out all the new test cars, and I'm sure the residents are
desensitized by this point to the sight of exotic cars (& bikes - total of
four Ducatis among the designers & engineers) speeding past their homes.
Didn't really push it as I was trying to remain faithful to the break-in
period (well okay, maybe a couple of times...but it was a MOTORHOME!!! What
was I to do? :-) but did put the car through it's cornering paces. I am
ashamed to admit I was unable to get even a chirp out of the Pirelli
P-zeros with the P38 package. It's going to take awhile, I think, for me to
work up to the limits of this car. I am humbled. My carpool buddy nearly
blacked out when I took the 270=B0 onramp from La Jolla Village to 805N at a
conservative 65mph (hmm. still no chirping...)

Very pleased to report also that there really isn't a tremendous loss of
ride comfort with the P38 package. Even driving Miramar road (for those who
know the area, no need to explain, for the rest, picture a main
thoroughfare in Beirut. Finish construction, begin again at the other
end...) the ride is not terribly punishing. Certainly not as bad as an RX-7
R1. Highly recommended.

The sound, of course, sends chills down my spine. Friday was like beginning
a diet:"I think I'll start breaking it in tomorrow...", just to be able to
hear that 5000rpm growl.

Only problem so far, the ubiquitous 'top seal not seating in the
window-frame gutter' problem. Only happening on the driver's side, but
already after maybe a half-dozen closings the rubber bead on the edge of
the canvas has worn through the seal to the metal where it crosses over.
It's easy to push into place from the inside when closing, but not
something I want to deal with every time. In to the shop...

Planning on keeping it under 4200rpm to 1000 miles, despite the Porsche
service techs' adamant claims that the engine is 'broken in at the
factory'. Don't they read the owner's manual? Still skeptical about the
15000 mile oil changes also.

Looking forward to the real test - driving up the coast in august to the
Monterey Historics when it's broken in.

Wishing speedy delivery to all those waiting still,

Phil.
