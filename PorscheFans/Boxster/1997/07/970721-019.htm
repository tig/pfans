     I have had my Boxster into my dealer several times to have 
     the blinking coolant warning light looked at.  He claims the 
     reason I have to add coolant is because the heater coils are 
     higher than the filler, so there is air trapped which needs 
     to be bled.  I will talk to him about this.  BTW, he claims 
     to have been in touch with PNA service to understand my 
     complaint, and of course, they have heard nothing about such 
     a problem.
     
     Yes, I do believe that you should use only the Porsche 
     coolant, or water.

The San Diego Region "Windblown Witness" reports coolant leakage from a 
rubber T-fitting on the lower right side of the engine.  The report says 
that Porsche is aware of the problem and is under warranty replacing the 
T-fitting with an improved part.
     
Also a warning not to add any coolant to the Boxster except the type 
available only at ---you guessed it--- the dealer.  Says so in the manual.
