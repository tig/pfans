John et al,

I was going to get the Sport Package which includes the in-dash CD player,
but was hoping to have Porsche upgrade that to the CD changer so I could
play both CDs and tapes. However, the dealer says they can't make
substitutions like that in the packages. This makes your advice about
accessories very interesting.

Does anyone know if it is possible to save another $600 or so and attach
a CD changer aftermarket without the 490 sound system? Also, for the
people who are lucky enough to have listened to one, is the enhanced
sound system worth the extra money?

Also, I'm wondering exactly which options are also available as accessories
in addition to the ones John listed in his original mail. Anyone have a
list?

Thanks.

To John: Please e-mail me your list of recommended dealers.
