     Great to see activity again on the List .
     
     There were a few interesting remarks and questions on the last list .
     
     there were some interesting questions regarding legroom and 
     similarities or not between a mustang ...
     
     There Is a lot less room inside a boxster . Very little will fit 
     behind your head on the shelf and it takes two average sized people .
     I am 5.11" and there is plenty of room left for taller people.
     If you are looking at comparing it with a mustang ? That's a hard one. 
     If you can appreciate the fine engineering and tuning that goes into a 
     Porsche car with only a 2.5 Litre engine , the handling in incredible.
     the quality of the car is fantastic . there are No Tacky buttons or 
     plasticy knobs in most German Cars .
     It is possible to Purchase many American cars that will go as fast if 
     not faster (in a straight line)for cheaper but not many that are built 
     as well , hold its value as well and are as much fun as this .
     
     Floor Mats Issue ..
     This has came up a few times on the list .My Boxster mats have the 
     Performance straps to hold them in place . There is a plastic shield 
     that goes over the Rails of the seats ,unfortunately the shields have 
     to be removed by pulling them towards the nose of the car to install 
     the mats . They can not be made to fit back over the rails with the 
     mats in place. but you can not see the rails with the mats in place. 
     No big deal .
     
     The only wish I have about My Boxster is that I could Take it Back 
     home to Scotland where the country roads are empty (apart from the 
     Sheep) , the Police are less aggressive towards speeding and the 
     Drivers know how to pull over into a slower lane to let others pass .
     But I don't miss the Rain. Nor do I miss the Price 50,000 dollar 
     equivalent and the Top would not be down as often .
     Regards Mark Stocker
