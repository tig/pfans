Same thing happened to me!

First weekend I have my car, I'm driving up the I-5 toward Del Mar, and up
ahead I see a silver Boxster identical to mine in the slow lane. Amazing
coincidence, I think, since I rarely see them even around La Jolla. Tops
are down on both cars, and I pass a couple of lanes over, as he is slowing
to get off this exit. I honk and get the driver's attention, wave, but am
greeted by nothing but a blank stare. Whether shocked at discovering he
didn't have the only such car in town, or above acnowledging such unseemly
displays of fraternization, I don't know. Either way, I'd just gotten my
car, it was a gorgeous day and I was too jazzed to let it bug me. Oddly
enough, I haven't encountered any other Boxsters since.

Phil.
