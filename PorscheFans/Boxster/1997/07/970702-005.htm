I am 5'11" as well, so that pretty much answers my question...

Well, I wasn't really comparing the two cars.  I only mentioned the Mustang=
 simply to give spatial measurements for those of us who have seen one=
 (which let's face it the entire planet has).

Again, to compare a Mustang Cobra (pony car at best) and the Porsche=
 Boxster (assuming we would call it a sports car here) is ludicrous.  I=
 never intended to get into a discussion about hp/handling or fit and=
 finish between the two cars.

Agreed, and this has nothing to do with my query.
