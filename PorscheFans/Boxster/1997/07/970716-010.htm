I have a Ultralon cover for my Boxster that I got from Automotion for
$170 or thereabouts.

It is a very lightweight cover that rolls up so that it doesn't take
up very much of the rear trunk.

I read a lot about covers before purchasing this.  The best
information was in the archives of the Miata mailing list which can be
found at http://www.miata.net/archives.shtml.  

The basic thinking was that if you wanted a cover because you wanted
full protection (perhaps because you didn't have a garage), or you
wanted some small amount of  parking lot ding protection, and you
didn't mind the bulk, get a cover made with Evolution 3 fabric.

If you wanted something lighter and weren't going to keep your car
outside all the time, get Ultralon.

I have the Ultralon and I mainly use it while I'm at work to keep the
sun and birds off the car.  It has served me well so far and is easier
to use than I thought it would be.

Both covers breathe well and that is supposed to be very important so
that moisture doesn't get trapped inside.

One nice thing about the Boxster -- the rear trunk gets pretty warm
and can dry a damp cover pretty quickly.
