I received my Silver with Red leather Boxster late April.  Had it a week
went on holidays for 2 weeks.  Picked it up on my return to Perth Australia
and 6 days later did a 180 on a wet corner in a suburban street, jumping
the kerb with back left hand drivers side wheel wrecking a bizzo in the
back tyre assembly, cost $2,000 AUD.  got it back for 8 days when 3
aboriginal youths in a shitbox car swiped my front right hand fender as we
headed around a corner together.  They took off through the city, I
followed at speed, with front bumper hanging off and dent in right hand
quarter panel.  They escaped, AUD $5,000 damage.  I had the thing back 11
days when some kid drops a fruit crate, metal handle flies over 7 foot
fence, chips bonnet in 3 places.

I love the car, I just don't believe how much bad luck it has attracted,
not as much bad luck as smiling grins of acknowledgement.  

People in Perth are in awe of it.  I get lots of comments and looks, but
put my wife behind the wheel and have her take it on her own and everyone
says something.  She'll park it in abusy city street and then spend 10
minutes fielding questions from passers by.  

I agree with most, low end torque is lousy, 4 -6,000 revs fantastic.  I am
now much calmer around corners having spun the thing in the wet.  I don't
think the wind deflector does too much.  I didn't get it, thought it a rip
off to be frank.  The red leather interior is a real winner, thing very
little of the grey interior, quite bland.  
I'm 6 foot 1 and could not contemplate the manual, my legs would be baning
the steering wheel perpetually, the tip is a buzz.  Best time 0-100kmh
8.5ish.  It's done 3,500kms however I believe the engine loosens up and
develops a bit more kick as it matures.

You gotta love the car don't ya?
