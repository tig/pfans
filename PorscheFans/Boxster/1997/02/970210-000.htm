Martin,

I find myself in the same situation.  Dealer sold their red demo, but
want to insure that they always have one on the floor to show people. 
Mine, (white, tiptronic, sport pkg, red leather) is due in within the
week, but they are going to hold it on the floor till the next one comes
in (about 3 weeks later)  No demo drives, just for folks to lust after. 
I figure after all this wait, what's a few more weeks.  Besides, by
then, the weather will be great.

cheers,RC
