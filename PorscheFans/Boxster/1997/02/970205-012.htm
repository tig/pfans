Update on Boxsters from Finland. Feb. 5, -97.

German politicians & unions opposite Porsche's decision
to move part of Boxster production to Finland.
Wendelin Wiedeking from Prosche defend their decision 
by stating that production in Finland is the best solution.
Germans claim that their competitiveness will suffer
and also that the unemployment is in record numbers 
after war. There is also car manufacturing plants in Germany
witch arent utilizing their capacity fully.
Porsche had checked the German factories, but Finland won.
Lower salary cost had no significant meaning, but the    
flexibility of the Finnish factory had. Finnish factory will 
produce yearly 5 000 Boxsters, and production will start 
this year.
Wendeling Wiedeking state also, economy was not crucial. 
Quality is high and production can start quickly, within 
half year.

Wiedeking do not believe that the "Finnish Porsche" will
be resisted like 924. He continue that this model was 
produced by VW daughter company Audi and Porsche 
customers never accepted it. 

No flames regarding this, please, I'm just translating the news.
I translated this from Finnish, so this is as close I could
get it in English. No flames about torturing English,pls.

This clip is from KL Berlin, appeared in a Finnish paper 
February 5, 1997.

An other brief comment.
Valmet said the deal would hardly affect earnings for Valmet Oy
because the Automotive unit accounted for only about 4pct of 
group net sales, witch reached FIM 7,36 billion between 
Jan - Aug last year. 
But it would raise the car builders profile, Automitives CEO 
and president, Juhani Riutta, said 
There couldnt be a better reference than Porsche 
he added. 

I believe I already mentioned that the price for Boxster in 
Finland would about 500 000,-FIM. 
One USD equal about 4,6 FIM, if interested.

Gosh, this makes me proud, Finns making Porsche, yes!
Check from your map how high we are on the globe, 
Uusikaupunki is on the west coast, about 70km north from Turku.
