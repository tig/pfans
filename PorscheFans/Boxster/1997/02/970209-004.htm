I am currently planning to pick up a silver boxster with the sport pkg
next wk and am curious what others think about the resale value of the
different colors. The dealer indicated that silver was likely to be the
most popular color and thus the easiest to resell. He noted that it is
descended from the spyder and that it was only made in silver. I was
originally looking a guards red, but can't really find one anytime soon
and the silver looks very nice.

Another opinion, I drove the car and have a deposit down on it, but
can't pick it up because it is in an auto show all of next weekend--it
seems a bit crazy to have a buyer with cash, but an auto show comes
first. Their only other car is the red demo that they of course want to
keep on the lot for test drives. I am concerned with people at the auto
show somehow damaging the car. Should I demand some concession on the
car as a result?

They are in a strong position as of course there are a bunch of people
that will take it immediately if I don't.

BTW, the dealer has been very nice and has indicated that he will call
right away if he gets in any other cars and can let me have mine. I
believe they are being honorable, just trying to juggle priorities. BTW
the car is in Riverside, CA and will be in the Orange County auto show
this weekend.
