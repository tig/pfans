***TOP***
Sitting in the shop at my dealership is a blue Boxster with the same problem
you described with the top, the passenger side (in this case) material does
not slip back into place beneath the trim piece.

I've seen what it takes to dig around inside there, in an attempt to correct
the problem-  just hope it doesn't happen to you.  Their book does not cover
the top dynamics, so they are just shooting in the dark.  Boxster tops are
decidedly different than anything Porsche has made thus far.
The car sits, partially apart, awaiting the fix.

COLORs
Mine is white, and the dealership has delivered two silvers, mine, and a
black.  All cars, including the red display car, have black interior, except
the black which has gray.
I was told when I ordered mine that any diversion from these four colors
would delay delivery.
I'm completely satisfied with the white, it's lovely.
****
P16 option package includes:
the windscreen thing- a squeaker, I've taken it out, and the mesh plastic
things behind the seats in the roll bar, also out.
keyless remote.
17" wheels (not the parallel spoke type seen in Scottsdale).
in dash CD with special amp in the trunk.
zippered storage area under top and behind roll bar (neat)

No help on the center console matter.  My console is naked.
I just got a zippered nylon CD case where I keep thirty or forty CDs, either
stuffed under my seat or in the zippered 'caddy' behind me.
[and everybody knows about "CDPockits" don't they?  Neat envelope containers
that get rid of the stupid jewel cases.  See them at
http://users.aol.com/cdpockits/  ]

Haven't seen the Automotion mats, but the factory items are nice.  I had a
set, then they went away (long story, not to bother).  I'm getting a new set
in a couple of days, they look great.
****
Has anyone suffered the shake problem at 70 mph?
Any insights?
****
The front trunk is already pre-wired for the CD changer.  The head end
(Becker/Sony) can control a Sony 6 CD changer.  There are a few of these
changers still on the market, in case you are looking.  Sony has changed
their units to a ten CD changer, and likewise the protocols for communication
with the unit.  Get out to your best aftermarket car audio store and buy one
now, they'll probably go away.  Should be $499.00 installed.

Later,
Paul
