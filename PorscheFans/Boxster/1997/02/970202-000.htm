Like the famous 100,000 mile
tuneup from Cadillac, BMW, and who knows who else. ("Well, it's 100,000
miles, you need spark plugs, wires, and by the way, a cylinder head job...")

This is not a correction, but rather an "FYI".  You've correctly id'd what
the OEMs are doing w/ this extended service nonsense, but there's one point
not mentioned.  The stated time between "tune-ups" doesn't include factory
recommended oil changes.  It's based on inervals of several items including
changing of spark plugs, points, and valve adjustment.  It's really
ludicrous, since nearly all new cars have no points, hydraulic valve lifters,
and the replacement of plugs has very little to do w/ the design of the
engine.  Plugs last a lot longer due to improved plugs and ignition systems.
 At any rate, Ford and Cadillac seem to be the big promoters of "100,000
miles between tune-ups", and for the reasons you indicated.  The other reason
is that marketing execs have to do something to look like they're earning
their bonuses!
