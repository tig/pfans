In terms of color popularity, I think red is the most "popular" for
Porsches and sports cars in general.  Some love it; some hate it.  Seems
most Porsches I see are either red, black, or white.  In my opinion, get
the color you really want, even if you have to wait a while for it.  You
will be reminded of it every time you're in the car.

They probably will not give you any kind of deal due to the show.
Hopefully the car will be locked at the show, so Bubba and his huge key
ring can't sit in your pristine leather seats.  Just go over the car with a
fine-toothed comb before you lay your money down, and whatever you do,
don't drive it home before any damages (scratches, dings, etc.) are
repaired to *your* satisfaction.  If you note any damages, I'd give them an
extra deposit to hold the car (to show your good faith) until repairs are
complete.  Then do the deal.

If the car isn't what you want and in the condition you want, let someone
else have it.  There will be others.  No doubt you will be very emotional
at this point, and may not be critical enough.  If you can, take a friend
with you who is more subjective.  Be prepared to leave without the car if
necessary.  If you settle due to dealer pressure, you will regret it later.

Maybe I'm jaded, but don't trust them.  Good luck!
