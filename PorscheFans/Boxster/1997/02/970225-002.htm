Hello BoxsterFans:  My local Porsche dealer has a Boxster delivered 
today 2/25/97 that the "buyer" walked away from.  Seems buyer was 
employee of dealership and decided not to take car.  Boxster in 
turquoise blue with gray interior, hard top (so much for no hard 
tops), sports package.  This is a very attractive car if this is the 
color for you.  I'm sure it won't last long as every dealership seems 
to have a long waiting list.  If you are interested, call Ira Porsche 
in Danvers, MA and ask for Ed Lannon (508) 750-7100.  I have 
absolutely no connection with this dealership except I have purchased 
two Porsches from them, including my Boxster.  Here's one with no 
waiting.
     Got a great book in the mail from Vasek Polak parts department 
today:  Boxster by Porsche (authors Becker, Lewandowski and Volker) . 
 This book is a definite buy - great text on Boxster development and 
lots and lots of pictures.  Also got the Boxster, Service Information 
Technik book.  This is one from the more mechanically inclined and 
sort of a techinal service manual introduction to the car.  Worth the 
$25.   Have also located a very limited supply of the Aluminum door 
sills with the Boxster script at Champion Porsche in Pompano Beach, 
FL.  These are $360 a set, attach with adhesive tape so there is no 
drilling required.
    Oh, about the Hard Top.  I think it looks great and is very 
nicely done on the interior.  Hope to see my donor car (with unwanted 
Hard Top) with next two weeks.  
     My car now has 1,250 miles and needs its first quart of oil.  
Otherwise, car is a great pleasure to drive (after you get used to 
all the rubberneckers).  Regards, William Harris
