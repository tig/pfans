Received my set of Porsche issue mats yesterday, the ones with the handy
clips that snap into the eyelet in the end of the seat rails.
Nice stuff, looks real good, fits perfectly.
(cannot say anything about aftermarket mats, haven't seen any.)

Did I say this before;  pizza in the back, ice cream up front.

Haven't lost any more coolant since the hose was replaced.
[Book says it is a lifetime install, never needing replacement or refreshing.
 I have two friends who have Boxsters and they've both had to top off the
coolant.  Interesting, very interesting...]

Have 1,700+ miles on it thus far.  I'm putting it away soon (as hard to put
down as it is).  I swear I will.

Have put one quart of Mobil 1 in since I got it.  It is now reading full and
stays that way.  

Still have that shake thing between 70 and 75 mph.  It's not the wheels or
tires, it's something else.
I think it's the entire drive train, somehow undampened for the specific
oscillations that occur at that speed.
Something is not right.
Anybody else out there get the 'shake'?

Outboard adjustable vents are both broken.  Came that way.

Car goes in for attention to a short list of things needing correction.
I'll let y'all know what transpires.

Also, getting a little weary of talking to strangers about it.
Never, EVER, fails that -at a light, in a parking lot, even when I'm not in
the car but nearby- someone wants to ask questions.
It's all well intended, but I never signed on as an ambassador for Porsche
(guess it comes with the territory).
I'm a pretty good natured bloke, so I take it in stride.
EVERYONE is very positive about it.  They all appreciate the look, most
assuredly.  Great comments (I'll make a list!)

I still get offers to sell it (and it is most tempting!)  

If you are thinking of getting one, do.  It's great fun.
Get the 17" wheels.  [Or, get the 16" stock wheels and invest in some nice
18" wheels, probably 9.5 & 8.5 combo, they fit with no restrictions or
rubbing.]  
The 'Technic' suspension is nice but only if you are going for autocross
performance.  The ride is nice, but nothing substantially better than mine
without  it.  The TCS is useless, don't bother unless conditions persist
requiring it.
Key less remote with infrared security is nice to have.
Get the door sill covers (not the carbon fiber @$400!!) but the rubber ones.
 That expanse of sill is sufficient to get ugly scrapes from shoes, not to
mention the little rise where the storage release levers are (they get pretty
nicked up to, but no fix from Porsche is known -by me).  Be mindful of these
two areas when you get in and out of the cars, either side. The CD upgrade is
good.  The car is then prewired for the CD changer up front, and there is a
Sony 6 disc changer available that costs $499.00 installed by any car stereo
place.  The upgrade also gets you some nice speakers and an amplifier.

That's all for now.  Hope this answers those questions some of you inquired
about.
Later, Paul.

*Speaking of performance...  Florida Citrus Region is sponsoring a PCA
Drivers' Ed event at Roebling Road this weekend.  I happen to have it on good
authority a tricked out Boxster, complete with P38 suspension package, wider
wheels and sticky tires, will be in attendance there.
Hopefully that list member will give us a full report afterward!
