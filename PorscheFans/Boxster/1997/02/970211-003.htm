 As a further note on the two posts below, I was at the dealer doing some
final negotiations on a 97 911 Coupe (giving up my year long deposit on a
Boxster for "True Love" or "Erring (or Airing?) Judgement" depending on your
view) and a couple in their late 60's got out of a Jeep Grand Cherokee and
came into the showroom to look at the new MB SLK (Silver, presold).  Woman
put her purse on the rear deck and "dragged" her substantial behind over the
doorsill into the seats while complaining "doesn't have much room" and her
husband, complete with imitation Championship Rodeo belt buckle leaned over
the other closed passenger door (what was that scraping sound?...).  Mrs
Klutz actually got out and "repositioned" her mega-pound purse on the car
several times.
 
 They were also moving the "obligatory" Red Boxster (also presold) out of the
showroom for what I thought was a test drive.  When I asked our salesman, he
commented "the car got a couple of dents in the right front door".
 Apparently, a couple of "Generation X" (not even "Yuppie Wannabe Scums")
decided the best way to close the door was with their knees!  The hope was
that paintless dent removal would be able to remove the dents without
bodywork and repainting.
 
 If the dealer choses to display your car in the showroom, I would insist on
some "advertising" recompensation, including that 1): they lock the doors and
mark "Sold" on the windshield; 2:)agree that any cosmetic imperfections are
corrected prior to delivery; and 3:) for your courtesy and understanding they
give you at least a quality "gift" (car cover, etc or something of equivalent
value).
 
 The Auto Show display car is tougher since you know that if unlocked (as
many are) people will be constantly sliding in and out of the car, scuffing
the leather and sills (you've probably already noticed that they usually
beforehand remove the shift knob and anything else easily pulled).   First,
I'd insist that the car be locked and at least surrounded by those ropes to
keep people at arms length.  Second, if there is any question remaining about
the car being unlocked and people being allowed inside, suggest to the dealer
that you will in fact take delivery of this "display" model on a "temporary"
basis, while they order you a replacement car (recognizing this make take
12-18 months at the current presold level).  On your delivery order indicate
that you will pay a "nominal fair wear and tear" usage fee of $25-50 per
month until delivery of your new vehicle (the fee should depend on how much
you might have to repay for Sales Tax) while awaiting arrival of your "new"
car.  If the Sales Tax is exhorbitant, suggest  that instead of registering
the car in your name, your total purchase price will be placed in escrow
pending delivery and your will accept the "display" model temporarily using
one of their dealer plates as a "courtesy car" (just like a loaner) until
your vehicle arrives.  In this case your "loaner usage fee" may be higher
($100 per month or so depending on type of insurance coverage).
 
 Give these a try, at least you'll get their attention...

  Martin,
  
  I find myself in the same situation.  Dealer sold their red demo, but
  want to insure that they always have one on the floor to show people. 
  Mine, (white, tiptronic, sport pkg, red leather) is due in within the
  week, but they are going to hold it on the floor till the next one comes
  in (about 3 weeks later)  No demo drives, just for folks to lust after. 
  I figure after all this wait, what's a few more weeks.  Besides, by
  then, the weather will be great.
  
  cheers,RC >>
