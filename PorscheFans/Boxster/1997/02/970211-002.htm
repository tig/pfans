       You can see a list of all the Boxster options on the Kelley blue
  book web site at 'www.kbb.com/cgi-bin/cgi.exe?kbb+nc+ncfrm:02377'.  As
  far as your other questions yes your package will have the "turbo twist"
  style wheels from the advertisements. I believe the other wheels are 16"
  base wheels. At least that's what is on my dealer's demo. As for the
  console I have the same question. The base demo I have seen and driven
  had a console but with two large holes - shelves really. In looking at
  the sticker this console was included at no extra cost. Maybe the various
  consoles offered (options 424, XMF, X21, XMN, XMM, XME, XMG) refer to
  special appearance, i.e. leather, painted, etc. I just can't justify the
  $261 for floor mats, even those from the factory. They probably buy them
  from an after-market supplier and you should too. Automotion is probably
  good but I'm getting mine from another company. I can get the boxster
  script embroidered on them in any color for around $160. The company name
  escapes me right now and the catalog is at home :( . I think it was
  something "motorsports". Anyway I'll post it when my memory returns.
  Whatever you do just be sure that the mats are specifically fitted to the
  Boxster and not to a 911 or some other car (oh sure it vill fit, rally it
  vill. Trust Guido. Now give me your moneey...). You might also want to
  make sure that the mats have some kind of fastening device or anti-skid
  so that they don't wind up in a ball under your brake pedal.
       The other note that mentioned the 70MPH vibration was very
  interesting. As a Miata owner and club member I have read about and
  experienced a dreaded high-speed (well, OK, only 65MPH) vibration. It has
  been traced to a wheel balance problem. The car is very sensitive to any
  imbalance. All wheels must be dynamically (spun) as opposed to statically
  balanced. Most places I've seen perform static balancing. This is fine
  for a family minivan but not for sports cars like the Boxster or Miata. I
  would check for the problem in this fashion: wheel balance first; tire
  "roundness" (flat spotted) second; wheel "roundness" (bent) third;
  4-wheel alignment fourth; check suspension components last. Good luck and
  please post what the problem turned out to be, if you find it. By the
  way, how bad is the vibration?

  See ya!
