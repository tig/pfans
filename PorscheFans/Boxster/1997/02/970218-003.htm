Greetings BoxsterFans:  My Boxster was seen for its third service 
visit today at Pass & Weisz Porsche in Burlington, MA.  This visit 
was to correct the persistent Check Engine light (on for over 500 
miles now).  The problem was corrected and this is the story given by 
the service Department and supposedly based on info supplied by PCNA: 
 when certain (some?) Boxster reached the port of entry they were 
determined to have weak batteries.  This checks with the first error 
code pulled - low battery at 250 miles.  Supposedly, there is a 
alternator problem in correcting (charging) the weak battery because 
the alternator wants to put out full voltage as soon as the cars is 
cranked up.  Supposedly, this is a problem for the OBDII computer, so 
the port of entry "adjusts" the alternator so that its voltage output 
is more gradual so as not to upset OBDII.  However, in doing this fix 
PCNA has learned that a vacuum line adjacent to the alternator 
sometimes is dislodged.  So, Reno tells the service department to 
check the vacuum line near the alternator.  Guess what, it is off.  
Put vacuum line back on, and everything is now OK.
    Also have been running down the story about Hard Tops.  Lots of 
contradictory information out there.  Paul Householder at Champion 
Porsche ( this guy sells more Porsches than anyone in the world)(yes, 
I know he is number 4 on PCNA's list, but the top 3 are all sales 
managers, not salesmen) has a number on cars coming in with hardtops. 
 He confirmed that they are being delivered with the Hard Tops.  What 
Lenny at Vasek Polak told me was correct IF you order the Hard Top 
after the sale - i.e. not available until Sept. 97 and then delivered 
unpainted.  However, believe I have arranged to buy a hard top to 
match my car at Ira Porsche because they have a car in bound with a 
hard top and the buyer doesn't want it.  IT MUST BE IN THE BOOK.  
     I have also just ordered the Boxster Book from Vasek Polak.  
Will let the list know what I think of it when it comes in.  Would 
recommend the Heritage Series of 1:43 scale models to the list, the 
series includes a very nicely done Boxster.  Should easily pass 1,000 
miles this week.  Regards, William Harris
