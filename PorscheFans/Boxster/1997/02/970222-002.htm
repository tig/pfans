Hello BoxstersFans:  well, more than a few list members have written 
me to question my assertion that I won't trade the Boxster for my 
previous C4S or 993 (C2).  Allow me to explain.
     1.  I can't afford to keep both.  If I could, I would gladly 
have one of everything.  Don't get me wrong.  The C4S is a wonderful 
car.  I put over 17,000 miles on mine in 13 months.  But, I have 
always been a roadster fan.
     2.  The two cars are very different.  I think the C4S is the 
ultimate expression of the normally aspirated 911 concept.  But, 
everyone should acknowledge that all 911s have that rear 
engine/oversteer handling that we learn to live with and love.  I 
enjoyed every day I drove the C4S.  But the C4S could not deliver 
what I enjoyed today.  Here North of Boston it was 74 and beautiful 
today.  I enjoyed a day of top down motoring.  To me there is nothing 
as exciting and free as the top down.  Only thing that compares is on 
a motorcycle.
     3.  I was concerned, especially after 2+ years in 993s, that the 
Boxster would be a let down.  Never happened.  First of all, its an 
emotional, sensual style thing.  If a roadster isn't IT for you, you 
just won't get it.  But if it is, then that cut down windshield, the 
kinda retro-funky instruments, the great supportive seats, and the 
sleek lines of the Boxster just put you there.  I will add to that 
the great handling.  I've done a few Driver's Ed events and plenty of 
street miles.  This Boxster just has nimble, agile and predictable 
handling.  I was throwing it into corners and curves all day long.  
Sure, its not as fast or as powerful as the 911/993.  I for one don't 
need to have the biggest and baddest car to enjoy driving.  The Boxster has 
more fun per cubic inch than any car I have owned.  Porsche may say 
entry level, I say world class. 
    4.  I've sampled and enjoyed a large number of sports cars:  
TR-6, 1966 small block roadster Corvette, 1966 427/425 hp Two Top 
Corvette Roadster, 1967 small block Air Coupe Corvette, 1990 ZR-1,
 1993 Two Top Corvette roadster, 1994 Twin Turbo RX-7,
 and the 993 and C4S.  
Obviously, the Porsches far exceed the others in build quality and 
focus on pure sports car.  Of all of them, since I can only afford 
one at a time, for my money, until Porsche develops something better 
(the Boxster S perhaps)  the Boxster is the most fun.  No flame wars 
please, just my humble opinion.  Regards, William Harris
