The coolant runs low, a warning light flashes on the dash, the owners manual
says don't drive it & contact the service center.
I contact the service center.
The coolant is some exotic concoction, made only one place in the universe,
and available only through Porsche.
The stuff is in Reno, but can only be sent via ground (evidently so volatile
it cannot be sent via air).
We've found a work around to get the car back on the road.
But, what causes the loss of coolant??
***
The R&L air ducts in the passenger compartment are cheezy and virtually
nonfunctional.  They pivot left and right, but do not tilt up and down.  The
bar that attaches them is disconnected, and, even if it were connected, it
wouldn't work for long.
I can only imagine Porsche will have a recall to install a working vent
control.
***
The car suffers from a miserable case of 'zoom-swerve'.
It's mine own term, allow me to describe:
While driving along in your own lane, minding  your business, a car in an
adjoining lane will zoom up beside you and swerve toward you to get a better
look or yell something unintelligible through a window.
I've seen people actually change directions on the highway and rush up from
behind to see the car close up!
This condition keeps you on your toes or on back roads.

Errata:  Previously reported by me, and mistakes they were-  
*no oil pressure, only a temp indicator gauge.
*the left l.e.d. below the m.p.h. indicator is the odometer.
   it changes after every start, not an accumulation until reset.
   there's a button to reset on the dash.
*there are no knobs in the car.  
   the two round switches above the cluster are for dimming dash lights
   and adjusting the clock.  Each has other purposes as well.  Fancy stuff.
*the main light switch is pulled to get to the fogs, not twisted.
*not 9.8 cubic feet of storage in the trunks, it's 9.1.
*texture on the dash is standard issue stuff, not carbon fiber as I said.
   that's what you get without the contacts in.
*the radio is a Becker (sic SONY).  car is pre wired for CD changer up front.
   there is only one SONY 6 CD changer that works.  Requires a rewire from 
   the head to the changer.  About $499 aftermarket, installed.
   it's a GREAT radio too!  
*oil level can be read from behind the wheel.
   at running temp it takes a few seconds with key on but engine off.
   it is said to indicate a 1.5 liter range, which doesn't quite jive with
the real dip stick.
***
There is no point in taking the car over 6K rpm, unless the moment demands
it.  Peak h.p. and torque are at around that number.  And DANG, if this thing
doesn't shift like silk!!
The car still is a great ride, and then some.  It continues to impress
favorably.

If you are ordering one, be sure to get a good long look at the complete
options list.  Study it well, and pick whatever you can imagine as useful or
important to you.  It's the only shot you get.
   Unfortunately PCNA forced us early buyers into a narrow window of
available options and colors.
   This sucks, but, to get the car where the slot was placed- you had to put
up with it.
   A car delivered yesterday, to a friend who was actually further up on the
order list, has the suspension package I would have wanted, plus an optional
interior color that wasn't available to me.
The car in normal configuration handles just great, so I doubt I'll miss the
optional susp. pack., but I would have liked the opportunity to buy what I
wanted.
It is my understanding you can get anything you want (at Alice's Restaurant)
now.

Ordering a Boxster now is a little like the roulette.  Place a deposit now,
they'll tell you it'll be six to eight months out before you get to pick your
options, a year to get your car.  Somebody who put a deposit down six months
ago decides not to follow through, or speculate as the case may be, and
-suddenly- you get a call and you've moved up thirty or forty places.  Check
with your local dealer.

A prudent buyer can find the base model red Boxster at MSRP ($39,900.00 USD),
for a little while.  
I find it so odd that excited messages abound with these 'find' deals on the
car, as though a conspiracy exists otherwise.  
Sure, some dealers are gouging with incentives and premiums, and a few
speculators have gambled to make some money on the limited availability--- so
what?  It's the American way.
If a person wants it enough to pay extra, more power to them.  If the sharp
buyer gets a discount, good for them.
It's that 'chicken little' guy in the middle that I find so curious.
