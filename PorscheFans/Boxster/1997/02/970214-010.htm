Hi Mark:  thanks for the note.  Well your experience is certainly 
different from mine.  Started out with Customer Commitment in Reno 
who put me in touch with Ben DeWitt the Regional Sales Manager for NE 
Region.  Mr. DeWitt also advised me that no Hard Tops were being 
delivered to ultimate customers.  I know they are in country because 
the sales guys who went to Arizona saw them there.  Would you use 
one?  I would because here north of Boston I drive my Porsche every 
day.  I just don't get into putting them away for the winter.  Got my 
car with a second set of 16 inch wheels with snow tires mounted.  The 
great thing about the Hard Top is the heated back glass which allows 
me to blast the snow and ice off.  With the soft top and plastic rear 
window it takes about 20 - 30 minutes to melt it off and get a good 
view.  Yeah, I know, I'm nuts but you never know when you'll go and I 
have a motto:  No wasted days.  Will let the list know when I can get 
a hard top.  Thanks for writing.  William Harris
