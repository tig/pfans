Here's a rather pricey Boxster (long story-Boxster price towards end.)

      Associated Press Writer
      SINGAPORE (AP) -- In other big Asian cities, growing wealth has
unleashed a flood of cars, trucks and buses that foul the air with
exhaust and snarl the streets with traffic jams that can stretch
for miles.
      Yet even as Singapore has matched their growth, it has escaped
the curse of their traffic congestion. Its air is clean. A cab ride
to the airport from downtown takes 15 minutes.
      This happy situation is no accident. It is the work of a
traffic-control program that fights smog and snarled traffic by
making this Southeast Asian island nation one of the costliest
places in the world to drive.
      At the heart of the system lies an unusual tool that has become
a badge of middle-class success: a permit to own a car.
      Sold at monthly auctions in limited numbers, the 10-year
licenses command prices of up to $75,000. Add sales tax and import
duty totaling 195 percent of a car's value, and a buyer can spend
the equivalent of $200,000 before hitting Singapore's tidy,
pothole-free streets.
      On top of that, Singapore charges drivers to enter downtown on
weekdays and is getting ready to impose tolls on all major roads.
Heavily taxed gasoline is kept expensive to discourage driving.
      Other Asian governments are studying the program, and a few have
plans to try using tolls to reduce traffic on key roads.
      But Singapore's approach can't be easily reproduced. The
governing party has been firmly in power since 1965 and is so sure
of its control that it can ignore resistance that might make other
governments back down.
      It helps, too, that a car isn't a necessity in a country so
small that a bicyclist can pedal from one end to the other before
lunch. Buses and taxis are plentiful. A mass-transit railway covers
much of the 25-mile-long island.
      The system has spared Singapore the traffic ordeals of cities
like Bangkok, the Thai capital whose noxious air was blamed in the
1995 death of a policeman who collapsed on the job. Or Jakarta,
Indonesia, where police carry oxygen bottles for bad air days.
      ``If that's the price we have to pay to keep from becoming like
Bangkok, then, well, I guess we have to pay it,'' said Tan Puay
Chin, a computer company employee who shares a Toyota sedan with
her brother.
      The Tans paid $53,000 for their Corolla and its permit in 1992.
They already are shopping for a replacement because prices are
rising so fast that the same model with permit now costs $100,000.
      ``If we wait any longer, we won't be able to afford a car at
all,'' Tan said.
      That would suit Singapore's leaders, who have kept this nation
of 3 million people clean and green while presiding over its rise
as a port and center for banking and electronics manufacturing.
      The government created the permits in 1991 in an attempt to slow
the growth of car ownership.
      Despite the cost, there is no shortage of bidders for the 3,000
to 3,500 permits issued each month. Most are sold to car dealers,
who sell them with new cars and pass on the cost to buyers, sparing
them the effort of acquiring their own permits.
      The result is there are 350,000 cars on Singapore, or one for
every eight people. The government says it will let that rise to
540,000 cars by 2010.
      Economists blame the free spending on cars for a steep slump
afflicting the Singapore retail industry. They say consumers have
so much money tied up in cars that they have little left to spend
on anything else.
      Cost has made the permit system such a sensitive issue that few
will discuss it publicly. Officials who control the permits, the
industry group of car dealers and the Singapore Automobile
Association all declined requests for interviews.
      The permits and their fluctuating prices, which are reported by
TV news and fuel cocktail party chatter, are just the start of the
system.
      Police use closed-circuit television to coordinate stop lights
and manage traffic flows. Stores, churches and other owners of
public parking spaces are taxed for each space to discourage them
from offering free parking.
      Heavily taxed gasoline costs the equivalent of $4.46 a gallon,
compared to $1.69 in neighboring Malaysia. To prevent drivers from
heading across the causeway just to fill up, cars are barred from
leaving Singapore with fuel tanks less than half full.
      To fight inner-city congestion, drivers are charged $1.40 to
enter downtown on weekdays. Plans call for tolls on every major
road by the end of 1997, using electronic sensors to bill passing
cars automatically.
      But if Singapore has any lesson to teach, it is that high cost
alone cannot cool the public's love affair with the automobile. It
may even fuel the snob appeal of the Rolls-Royces, Mercedes Benzes
and other luxury models that fill Singapore's streets.
      Mercedes has been the top seller for three years, with more than
4,000 cars sold in 1996. One dealership has 21 orders for the new
Porsche Boxster sports car priced at $235,000 that begins arriving
in February.
      With incomes rising rapidly, no one is forecasting an end to
demand by Singaporeans for cars and their expensive permits.
      ``Most people who have had a car, or just feel peer pressure,
still want a car,'' said Chye Kit Soon, a lawyer who writes for
Drive, a Singapore car magazine.
