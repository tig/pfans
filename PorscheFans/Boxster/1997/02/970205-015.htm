....yep, sitting in the drive outside is a piece of shit econobox Porsche has
'lent' me while the Boxster sits on a rack at the local dealership.
The car sits on the rack because my coolant leak is coming from a very poorly
designed "T" hose just past the water pump.  Not burst yet, but looking like
it will.
There are no parts at the dealership to replace the piece.
P.C.N.A. Reno has yet to respond about the part availability there (sic;
stateside).

Let me tell what a crappy piece of work that hose is;  I've seen it before on
my 6 series BMW [probably the same source.]  It's a fused/vulcanized
junction, as opposed to doing it the right way (a "T" fitting, then hoses
clamped to that.)  
I've heard about leaks in test cars, in some of the cars at the Scottsdale
presentation, and even with end users now.
It's the same lousy part failure, I'll wager.

Worst of all, to me, is the sick feeling I've bought into another 'hanger
queen' Porsche debacle.
I figured there'd be a little Guinea pig to owning the first one, but I don't
want to inherit their bad planning at this kind of expense.  If the car is
shelved more than driven, it goes back.  For good.

The hose is on Porsches' suggested parts list for dealers, whereas a dealer
can elect to stock it or not.
Most figure what the heck goes wrong with hoses in the first year or two??
Why bother?

My car has slightly over 500 miles.
Of the nine days I've had it, the Boxster has been undriveable for two.
 [First the leak itself with accompanying warning light, the question of what
coolant to use to top off.  Now this.]

Go ahead, ask me my impressions!  (said in my best Clint Eastwood
impersonation.)
