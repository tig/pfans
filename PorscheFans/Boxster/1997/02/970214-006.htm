Picked up my Boxster 2 weeks ago.  At 250 miles the check engine 
light came on and stayed on.  1st visit was to dealership where I 
purchased the car.  There I discovered that the Boxster specific 
diagnostic computer was still in the shipping box in their parts 
department.  Once the computer was unpacked, the service tech 
discovered that the computer must be powered up for 24 hours before 
it could be used.  So, off to the next closest dealer.  Luckily in 
the Boston area there are 5 dealers within a 30-45 minute ride.  So, 
on to Dealer 2.  After about an hour the service department tells me 
the problem is fixed.  Claims the OBDII computer had stored an old 
error code for a weak battery prior to delivery.  So, off I go.  At 
350 miles, the next day, the check engine light comes on again.  Back 
to Dealer 2.  They check the car again and pull up at least four 
different error codes - secondary air pump, various emission sensors 
out of spec, etc.  Problem is (after several calls to PCNA) that 
they have no service procedure available to address this problem.  
Two days later (2/13/97) they call me to say that PCNA has given them 
additional guidance and to bring the car in 2/18/97.  The service 
manager tells me that right now the Porsche service manual on our 
cars are virtually non-existent.
     By the way, despite this minor glitch, I love the Boxster.  
Previously owned 1995 C2 and 1996 C4S.  Wouldn't trade the Boxster 
for either of them.
     Have also learned that Hard Top is not presently available 
because Porsche would not accept them from supplier because of poor 
fit.  Talked to Lenny in the Parts Dept at Vasek Polak regarding 
future availability.  Vasek Polak is trying to get Porsche to paint 
the Hard Tops at the factory and to deliver them in a special 
shipping container.  Right now (according to Lenny) Porsche is 
contemplating delivering the Hard Tops unpainted.  I suggest those on 
the list who want a Hard Top write to PCNA and lobby for painted Hard 
Tops and special shipping containers.  Can't wait for parts to be 
available for special orders.  After 2 weeks my car has seen 850 
miles and I can't stop smiling.  Can't wait for warmer weather and 
top down driving.
