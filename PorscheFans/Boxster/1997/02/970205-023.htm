Has anyone placed a order for a Boxster, requesting specific optional
equipment?  Going through the price list on the Web page for Kelly Blue
Books (www.kbb.com) the option list has so many bits and pieces for
leather trim, parts for the Air Vents, Console, Door sill, with the prices 
(to me) being outragously expensive.  What is the explanation for the 
$7,000 sport package, $5,000 aerokit, $3000 for metallic paint, the 
price list goes on and on. 

I saw two Boxster's at a brokers showroom the other week.  They were the
early build cars, where you took what the dealer received if you wanted a car.
Looking at them, they had basic equipment and some options, 17" wheels, 
one had the red/orange leather interior.  I do not know what the cars cost, or 
what the broker is asking, but looking at the price list on the web, you can 
easily have a $50,000 to $55,000 Boxster if I am reading it right.

Not that I have any plans to purchase a Boxster (a new one anyway), just
suprised at the multitude of options and the prices associated with them.
