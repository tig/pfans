I obviously missed this problem description, can somebody e-mail me a description?

Dealer here has a Silver and Zenith Blue, on site, a Silver and Turquoise due in a week, and a 
Black and Metallic Black on order. No mention of colour being a problem unless you get into the

Good to know as I didn't get the CD changer. I think the pre-wire comes with the upgraded sound 
system , but isn't difficult to install later without the sound package.
