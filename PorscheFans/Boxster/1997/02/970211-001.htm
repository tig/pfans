It was my assumption, upon seeing cars with the sport package in
pictures and on last week's Motorweek, that the cool wheels that you
see in all the brochures that sort of look like 911 Twin Turbo wheels
are the Boxster wheels.  I'm not sure what the spoked wheels are, but
I agree they are ugly.  My car has the 16" wheels which are quite
nice, but not as nice as the sport package wheels.  Surprisingly,
there is only one picture of the 16" wheels in the brochures, and you
have to look very closely to find them.

As for floormats, I was about to order some from Automotion.  Has
anyone actually received Boxster mats from Automotion?  How are they?

Since I suspect no one has them yet, I'll also ask has anyone ordered
floormats for a different Porsche from Automotion and been satisfied?
I think the automotion mats are about half the price of the Porsche
mats on the price list.
