 I contact the service center.
 The coolant is some exotic concoction, made only one place in the universe,
 and available only through Porsche.
 The stuff is in Reno, but can only be sent via ground (evidently so volatile
 it cannot be sent via air).
 We've found a work around to get the car back on the road.
 But, what causes the loss of coolant??

Ayup. My test car had 400 miles on it too, and it also lit up the coolant
light. I didn't want to do anything myself, but i pointed out the light to
the outfit that handles the cars for Porsche when they came to pick it up,
and they asked if I had some water. Sure. I let them add it. I didn't check
the manual so I didn't know about the exotic coolant but now I guess I'm glad


I didn't add it on my own initiative.


>> The car suffers from a miserable case of 'zoom-swerve'.
 It's mine own term, allow me to describe:
 While driving along in your own lane, minding  your business, a car in an
 adjoining lane will zoom up beside you and swerve toward you to get a better
 look or yell something unintelligible through a window.
 I've seen people actually change directions on the highway and rush up from
 behind to see the car close up!
 This condition keeps you on your toes or on back roads.


Thankfully it's not as strong a butthead magnet as the GM EV-1 electric car.
Buttheads admire them, buttheads (with Birkenstocks) buy them.

 
>>the main light switch is pulled to get to the fogs, not twisted.

Mercedes has been doing that for a while, now others do it too.


>>texture on the dash is standard issue stuff, not carbon fiber as I said.
    that's what you get without the contacts in.

Pretty hideous IMHO. Wonder how many baby basketballs were skinned to cover
the dash and door panels? I would go for the leather if it covers these with
something else. 

 
>> There is no point in taking the car over 6K rpm, unless the moment demands
 it.  Peak h.p. and torque are at around that number.  And DANG, if this
thing
 doesn't shift like silk!!
 
Isn't that amazing? With the trans way back there, and A CABLE SHIFTER no
less? 914 people would be amazed...


>> If you are ordering one, be sure to get a good long look at the complete
 options list.  Study it well, and pick whatever you can imagine as useful or
 important to you.  It's the only shot you get.

Strongly recommend the P38 handling package (not to be confused with the P38
twin-engined fork-tailed devil package). 
 
>>A prudent buyer can find the base model red Boxster at MSRP ($39,900.00
USD), for a little while.  I find it so odd that excited messages abound with
these 'find' deals on the car, as though a conspiracy exists otherwise.  
 Sure, some dealers are gouging with incentives and premiums, and a few
 speculators have gambled to make some money on the limited availability---
so
 what?  It's the American way. If a person wants it enough to pay extra, more
power to them.  If the sharp buyer gets a discount, good for them.
 It's that 'chicken little' guy in the middle that I find so curious.
  
If anybody wants to know what the real invoice prices are (not counting
dealer incentives and holdbacks, of which there probably are none at this
time) you can check out the Edmund's web site at 
http://www.enews.com/magazines/edmunds/
This will tell you what the dealer really paid for the car. My personal rule
of thumb for buying a non-high-demand car is 5% over invoice. I can usually
do that too, for dispos-a-cars like Toyotas and the like. More difficult when
a car is hot on the market, but I'll bet I could do that now with the 993.
Someday you will be able to do that with the Boxster too. I use the original
Miata as an example of how the feeding frenzy for a new model manages to part
fools and their money; there were people paying $6000 over sticker for the
things, and that lasted for all of 6 months. So these fools were paying $1000
a month just to be seen in the things. 

>>Is there going to be a boxster@porschefans.com??
 
There is. (Duh, dat's wear dis was posted, boss...) See the web page at
http://www. porschefans.com to sign up online.
