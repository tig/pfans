In a message dated 12/24/97 4:11:48 AM, someone wrote (about Barrier):

<<Bud has implemented a recommendation for his customers to run regular oil
for 3-5K miles, and then switch back to Mobil 1.  Why?  So the rings will seat
more quickly and the engine will stop burning (as much) oil>>

So Bud, the SALES GUY, dictates to the Service Department a plan in DIAMETRIC
OPPOSITION to what is RECOMMENDED in the OWNERS MANUAL (as written by the
manufacturer).
What the Service Rep meant to say, in suggesting you speak to Bud in Sales,
was "Hey, I'm just a delbert, let me send you to the real bull shit artist,
he'll hoodwink you like I can't."

Fer one;  the oil burning issue should be a burning issue with any owner (or
dealer) dumping regular or synthetic at that rate (every 500 miles!)
Something is WRONG with an engine that devours that much oil.
Fer two;  if the engine is truly burning oil at that rate it will only be less
expensive with regular oil, and rings will seat just the same- burning
synthetic or regular.  
Fer three;  rings don't take 3-5K miles to seat!!  [incomprehensible load of
drivel!!]
Fer four;  I've got some FL swamp land prime for sale to folks who believe
this line of crap. (I really do!)

My Boxster, with 15,000 miles, burned one quart of Mobil 1 within the first
1,250 miles or so.  
To date, it hasn't lost a drop.  (as a matter of fact, that dang little car
has taken only a pint of coolant and a quart of oil in all those miles.
Wonder what the genius "Bud" would have to say about that?  I know, "Your
rings were pre-seated at the factory with special voo doo.")
