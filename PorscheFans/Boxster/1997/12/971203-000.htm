a) the M3 Convertible WON'T be available in the USA... I got this info from
Prestige BMW in NJ
   the #4 BMW Dealership in the USA when I went w/ my friend to help him buy
one... BMW  
   states..."it is a purpose-built vehicle" the purpose is to have a EUROPEAN
exclusive model.
   great car ...one I would love to play w/ myself but have to go across the
pond to do so.
   I think I'll stay here and bask in the glory of my lovely thrill machine...
I love my 
   Boxster.

b) The "surcharge" as you called it is part of a package... where Porsche will
set you up w/ 
   insurance and plates for while you are in europe... as well as meals and
sites... while you 
   pick up your car... considering that 1100bux for 3 days plus the licensing
and insuring is 
   quite a bargain.

c) The SLK's top is not that extroardinary... The Boxster's folding top is the
real 
   innovation... its like no other convertible on earth... not just because its
made of 
   magnesium... but its design... and if your hell bent on having a hardtop
convertible...
   get yourself a MITSUBISHI 3000GT Spyder... which brings me to ...

d) Japanese cars... better than German cars? or european cars in general for
that matter?
   what toxic substances are you addicted to?

e) Before you make a choice... go drive the boxster... you'll love it... have a
test drive...
   after one you'll want more... then try the other cars in your list... your
choice will 
   become clear.
