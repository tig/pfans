Having just returned from Germany after taking Euro delivery of my
Black/Red 98, I thought I'd pass along some insight.

The blue top looks great.  No dealer in my area had a sample before I
ordered, so I passed.  But the silver w/ blue top looks good and Ocean
Blue w/ blue top also looks good.

The assembly line is one of the most impressive manufacturing processes
I've ever witnessed.  I was amazed that 993, 996, 986 are produced on
the same line in random order (70 Boxsters, 35 993, 35 996 per day).

The facility in Finland builds and paints the body then sends it to
Germany for insertion on the assembly line.

Boxster S has no current plan for production.  They can't keep up with
demand for the current products, will wait until demand falls to intro a
new product.

The recomendation is to put the top up at night, prolonged periods w/
the top down can cause problems like the ones we've seen on this list.

The Tourist Delivery experience is highly recommended, even if you don't
take delivery there, the plant tour is a must do if your in the area.
