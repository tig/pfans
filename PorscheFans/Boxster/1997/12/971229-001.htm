Just received a new pair of visors for my Boxster without the Damn
Airbag Stickers!!  They look wonderful.  While in England earlier this
year I noticed that Boxsters there don't have the Damn Airbag
Stickers, so I asked a dealer in London if he could order a pair for
me.  It took him a long time to find the correct part number (the
first time he ordered a pair, they came *with* the Damn ...).  After
many phone calls to Germany he found out the magic part number and I
now have a pair of nice looking visors!

Here are the magic part numbers for Boxster sun visors *without* the
Damn Airbag Stickers:

	986.731.031.08 EBY
	986.731.032.08 EBY

(One number is for the left visor, and the other number is for the
right visor.  The "EBY" parts of these parts numbers are the magic
elements.)


Now that we have the magic part numbers, I would expect any dealer in
the US to be able to order them as well, but if you want a pair and
can't get a US dealer to order them for you, let me know, I've got the
name and number of the dealer I went to in London and another one in
Munich.
