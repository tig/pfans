The Boxster let us down once again on the way from Jim Ellis's (Atlanta),
where it had been trucked for repair.  Apparently they had not discovered
that the alternator was not charging, but thought the battery was at fault.
If they had listened to the customer's description of the symptoms it should
have been obvious that there is nothing wrong with a battery that runs a car
all weekend but then gives out Monday morning.  They are supposed to fix it
and truck it back to me in Athens GA today.  We will see.  The electrical
power went out last night about 1 1/2 hours from Jim Ellis' lot;  I assume
that is about what can be expected from a newly charged battery that is not
being recharged when driving with lights on.
