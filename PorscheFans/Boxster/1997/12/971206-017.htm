Brian,

	Jason's explanation was technically correct, but somewhat 
incomplete.  Larger wheels don't necessarily give you a larger outer tire 
diameter.  They are more typically used to give you a lower aspect ratio. 
 (That's the 50 in 205/50 x 17).  A lower aspect ratio means less of the 
total diameter of the wheel is sidewall (and more is rim).  In addition 
to the added stiffness, and quicker turn in, in a hard corner, there is 
less tendancy for the tire to roll over onto its sidewall, so more of the 
tread stays in contact with the pavement.  You can also reduce rollover 
by increasing tire pressure, but this has the undesired effect of 
creating an uneven contact pressure (and smaller contact patch), which 
can actually reduce traction (there is an optimum pressure that is 
sometimes tricky to find).  An additional benefit of larger rims, is that 
they will accomodate larger brake rotors, which are more efficient, don't 
heat up as fast and are generally better (but these do not automatically 
come with the 17" wheel packages from Porsche, and must be added 
seperately.

I hope this helps, and is not much more than you wanted to know.
