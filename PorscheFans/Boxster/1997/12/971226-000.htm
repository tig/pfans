I was curious what your opinion (or anyone else's) is on Malm's
products.  I've used their products (Polishing cleaner and Carnuba wax)
for a few years and have been quite happy with the results, but having
never used Mequiars or Zymol products, I have nothing to compare it to.
Thanks,

<<I know that Porsche also specifies a maximum oil consumption for their 
cars of 1 liter every 600 miles.>>

This 'hedge factor' covers their ass when there is a problem with design,
implementation, or workmanship.  That's a lot of oil, in any book.  If you
have that kind of consumption there is something wrong with the engine.
If they put in the book this obscene rate of consumption is okay, then, when
your crumby engine finally succumbs to whatever is wrong, you can't sue them.

Viscosity is viscosity by any other name, synthetic or standard issue.  
If you are using the same weight oil of either type it is functionally the
same inside the engine- standard oil leaves no more deposits than synthetic,
and synthetic flows no more/less easily than regular stuff.

My observation comes from NOT looking at drips on the garage floor but on the
hanger floor.
An oil leak is a very serious matter when it develops at altitude, like
between 5,000 and 10,000 feet in the air.
Synthetic oils have been approved for use in aviation for ten years (turbine)
and five years (recips).  Aircraft engines (and most specifically the recips
in rotor aircraft) get rebuilt regularly on pre defined schedules.  
Synthetic oil does not eat seals, nor does it 'seek' gaps, openings, or other
imperfections in seated surfaces.

Synthetic is superior because its' viscosity does NOT break down as
temperature increases, like standard oil.  The exorbitant cost of synthetic is
debatable though.
Accepting oil loss at a rate of one liter every 600 miles is not appropriate.
My car consumed one quart (almost exactly one quart) in the first 1,250+/-
miles, and has not sucked another drop since (car now shows 15,000 miles).
The rings seated during the 'break in' period, and now continue to do their
job (imagine that?!).

Know what this reminds me of?  The famous re-ringing of the vaunted 924's when
they first came out.
Anybody remember that fiasco??  You'd think they'd learn a lesson!
