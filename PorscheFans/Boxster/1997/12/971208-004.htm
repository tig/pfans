Hi everybody,

I have been enjoying the Boxster way too much....  
On Saturday, I went out to a party and got to meet a few people.  
On the way out, I saw that 4 of the people I met drove Porsches...
A 911 Turbo, a 911 and a 911 cabrio (all 993's).  All silver too.  And
my silver Boxster....
Let me tell you, what a beauty....  We all got excited and decided to
SLIGHTLY exceed the posted speed limit.  This car revs beautifully.
Well, after about 30 min. of "racing", we came to our destination and I
later found out that one of the guys works for Porsche(as a test
driver/representative) and that he had recently been to Stuttgart for 5
weeks.  He got to race there and told me he came in second after a RS,
and behind him was a couple of 911 Turbos, Carreras...  Seems like the
Boxster outhandles them quite noticeably.

But here is the good news.  I asked him about the "S" version and he
told me it's definetely going to be built.  Probably not until beginning
of 99 though... 

He definetely recommended removing the hard top and putting the top up
for those with hartops in the winter.  He is trying to put together some
kind of event for the Boston area, so we'll see....

Be patient "S" orderers...

Alberto.
