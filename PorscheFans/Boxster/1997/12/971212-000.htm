Martin.....

I have a few answers for some of those nagging problems with the Boxster
The round circles on the rear window I believe are due to heat from the engine leaking through
When the top is folded down. It seems to clear with cleaning.
The air bag light is due to a problem with the seat belt buckles and is the subject of 
A service bulletin and a fix by Porsche.
The passenger door lock buzz is due to a bad or slipping gear in the lock mechanism ( mine was fixed under warranty)

Good luck

Bill

I am on my fourth engine main seal.  I most notice the leak after a 2-3 hour
drive on the interstate, at a constant 3000 rpm range.  I park the car and the
next morning, there is a noticeable puddle of oil under the car. 
The round circles appearing are a result of the plastic laying against the
black round fastners visible on the bottom of the top compartment.  My circles
finally disappeared after 6-7 months.  I believe it to be caused by the heat
reacting with the plastic.  Solution, lay a rag over the black fastners and
that should stop it.
The aribag light will continue to come on if not fixed.  The solution is to
replace the seat belt anchor as the contacts are bad.   
>>* the top latch has to be "double clutched" to get it to close, i.e.
when closing it, the final position is just an inch or so short--can
operate the latch a couple of times and it pulls it into position<<<
The top latch problem is that there is a broken part in the latch.  The latch
continues to work some how.  Ask the tech to take a look at the inside of the
latch.  My latch was working fine, but every time I hit a bump, it sounded
like the car had a loose top.  Investigation showed the broken internal parts
in the latch.

We need more input on problems.  How about it gang ?????
