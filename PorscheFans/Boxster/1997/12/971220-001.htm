This person sends out these poorly disguised advertisments for his zymol
page from time to time. He sends them to Porsche Pete's Boxster Board as

i have tried using zymol polish, kind i found at k-mart and it works pretty
well and its expensive, abour 20 bucks.  however then i heard that thats not
real zymol.  i searched the internet for days and found real zymol its very
expensive.  i found one site thats cheap, its at
>http://pages.nyu.edu/~kql2938/
>but i dont know if its worth paying this much for a real wax or just
sticking to the kmart zymol liquid polish.  what is everyone recommending
and are you all really buying polish costing over 100 bucks?
