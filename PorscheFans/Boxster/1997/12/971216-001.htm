I took delivery on my Boxster last Thursday.  Friday night the 'check
engine' light came on with no change in driveability.  I drove it through
the weekend.  Monday morning on the way out to work other lights appeared,
first the battery, then the airbags and some others.  I stopped at the end
of our road to see if restarting the engine would reprogram the thing, but
then it wouldnt crank.  I pushed it off the road, jogged the two miles back
to my house and took the trusty Ford Ranger to work.  The BMW dealer lives
up the road; if he saw it before it was towed off, I'll never hear the end
of it!  Pat Collins, my 356 man in Atlanta says it was the alternator, which
sounds plausible.  Jim Ellis PA was supposed to finish it today and call me,
but never did.  The roadside service is fairly prompt in towing dead cars
away, now we'll see about the efficacy of the repair system, hopefully
tomorrow.  I have two Porsches in the shop in Atlanta right now, and
tomorrow is the only hope for a ride for my wife and me before Christmas.  A
logistical nightmare!  This breakdown makes me think Jaguar and Lucas--I
hope not!  I've driven a 356 daily for 25 years and it did let me down once.
It broke a crankshaft one block from my house.  So far I think the 356 is
ahead, though the Boxster is more fun to drive and sounds soo nice!!  Scott
