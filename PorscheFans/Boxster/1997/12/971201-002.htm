Each car is fine in it's own right.  Follow your heart and testosterone.
 Some are more practical or more powerful than others.  

The SLK is not as sporty, too small, and ugly IMHO.  The NSX has lost a bit
of its shock appeal and looks like it wants to be from Italy.  It is a
phenomenal automobile though the Boxster has more interior and storage space
and better looks.  M3 cabrio will outdo the Boxster in utility and perhaps
perfomance; styling is an obvious point of loss to the Porsche.  The Porsche
is a marquis, fun, and sexy.  A no brainer  from my point of view.  

The only other cars I considered were the C5 'Vette.  It's looks and engine
song are not as seductive and I'm skeptical about Chevy quality (is that an
oxymoron).  Also, the Ferrari 1988-89 328GTS with killer looks, manual
steering, and the best engine song on the road for a V-8 but too impractical
and with wallet-sucking maintenance not tolerated at this time of my life.
   

Remember, it is not a decision for life. Get a car and if you feel you've
made a mistake, turn itaround and sell at a loss of money but a gain in
experience.

I use the Boxster as an almost daily driver (3-4 days per week, 50 mi round
trip) and have no problems albeit I only have 2300 mi on the car. It is not
tiring to drive even with my 6' 2" frame.  (BTW, headroom is great with the
softtop and dramatically less with the optional hardtop which I did not get.)
The car gets much attention on the road.
