I have had my silver boxster since 2/97 and have put 12k miles on it.
Has been a blast and I love it, but has definitely had its share of
problems. I post mine just out of curiosity to see if others have had
similar problems and could comment.
The ones I have heard of from others:
* oil leak around the transmission--a few days in shop with the
transmission out
* check engine light on several times--never sure what caused it--engine
was not effected in terms of performance
* round circles imprinted on the back plastic window in the lower
corners about 4-5" in diameter--appears to be rubbing on something--not
yet looked at by service dept
* air bag light on repeatedly--supposedly fixed by cleaning the seat
belt contacts has worked for about 3 months, but is now back on again

New ones:
* drivers seat moves up on its own--from the bottom to the top in about
2 days--not a big deal, had it "corrected" once, but is back doing it
again just as before
* passenger side door lock emits a loud buzzing sound when the door is
unlocked--the lock has worked fine, but there is definitely some problem

* the top latch has to be "double clutched" to get it to close, i.e.
when closing it, the final position is just an inch or so short--can
operate the latch a couple of times and it pulls it into position

Any feedback on solutions for these problems is appreciated
