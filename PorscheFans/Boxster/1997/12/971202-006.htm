Buying a Porsche is, for all the expense involved, not a practical
decision.  When I saw the R&T article in early '93, showing the Boxster,
SLK & Z3 concept cars, I feel in love and vowed that if Porsche ever
produced the Boxster I would own one.  I took delivery of my Zenith
Blue/Graphite Gray Boxster on August 14th and have loved every minute
behind the wheel.  I thought the car would attract attention from sports
car afficianados but I am truly amazed how much this car turns heads
every time I drive it.  Almost every car that passes me on the freeway
is filled with people with their heads on a swivel.

I didn't consider any other car, but I have a few impressions.  The
Corvette - have owned 2, last one an '85.  Biggest pieces of junk I've
ever owned - NEVER AGAIN!!  Yes, "Chevrolet quality" IS an oxymoron.

Z3 - finally drove one last month, a 2.8.  I was very impressed with the
power and torque.  Throws you back into the seat when you mash the
pedal, unlike the Boxster's smooth rush of power.  Good handling, Miata
like interior - not as polished as the Porsche.  Leather seats look
awful, in my opinion.

SLK - haven't driven one.  Neat top.  Good ladies car.  Don't care much
for the interior.  Can't get a manual and from what I read the automatic
is terrible.  Either looks like a baby SL or a giant Hot Wheels car,
depending on your preference - I vote for the latter.

M3 - super car!!  Much more practical than the others, but I don't think
you can go wrong with it.  I'd love to have a M3 sedan parked in the
garage next to the Boxster (but I'll have to settle for a 626).

Conclusion:  If you have another car, or can get by without the back
seat, go for the 2-seater that fills you with passion.  With these cars
forget practicality and have fun!
