Ok... for the last couple of days I have been witness first hand to one of the
Boxster's would-be flaws... and want to bring it to the attn of my fellow
owners on the list so hopefully they wont have to learn about it like I did -
the hard way.

This problem pertains to the dilemma of what to do when the battery of your
baby dies and you can't open the front truck lock to jump the battery because
the lock is electric and you have no juice.  The severity of this problem is
for most that they have been handed bum info on the proposed solution... I've
heard of jumping the fuse... and some other false solutions... I'll tell you
what I was told from my Service guy at my dealer... This is a relevant issue by
Porsche's people because as he told me it was even one of the questions on the
qualification exam for the Boxster certification...

The solution is (AS PORSCHE WOULD HAVE) is to get at the emergency front trunk
release... as I was told it is hidden behind the DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT
HEADLIGHT... taped to it as I was told... I don't know the particulars of how
to get at it...but from my investigating my car to find this switch/lever I
realized the wheel housing (don't know clinical name... its the effective
interior mudgaurd/ instrument conceiler for the headlamp... big plastic piece
that covers the areas behind the front tire) must be removed or moved to get at
this and as I was told then there is some other thing to move... and then and I
quote "taped" to the headlamp housing is this switch/lever... actuate it and
pop goes the front trunk...

This is "not recommended" to be done by inexperienced personnel... My service
guy told me to call roadside assistance and have them tow the car to him and he
will do it for me.. I will see if I can get to watch the process... I want to
know how its done for future reference myself...

On a similar note... if you need emergency access to your gas tank look in the
manual for the emergency release on that...

Back to the story... Here's what causes the problem ... and here's how to avoid
it...
The problem is caused by the Immobilizer factory alarm system... if you didn't
get it, its possible you will never have such problems... but I can't confirm
this... 
The situation is as follows if you leave your car for a few weeks w/o driving
it or warming it up every couple of days... the Immobilizer (which is always
working) will slowly but surely eat at your battery) until the battery is
completely dead.  When the battery dies the Central Locking system cannot open
your front trunk so you have no direct access to the battery to remedy the
problem.  This leaves you in the shits.  How do you avoid this you ask? 
Especially important to those of you putting your little Sex Machine away for
the winter.... I in no way represent Porsche or their products here... I'm just
a frustrated owner who wants to keep more people from going thru this as
well... The solution to keeping your battery from dying is getting Porsche's
battery trickle charger... it plugs into your lighter outlet and the other end
into the wall outlet in your garage... and will keep your battery from dying...
its about I believe 78 - 82 dollars from the prices I've seen... and it works
to keep that battery ticking...

But if you are in the predicament I'm in.. you either get the directions from
your service guy as to how to get at the emergency release.. or buy the service
manuals to learn how to do it... or get Roadside Assistance to tow your car to
your dealer to have them do it...
