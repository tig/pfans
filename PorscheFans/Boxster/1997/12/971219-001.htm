The final diagnosis of our troubles is that the 'post' on the alternator,
presumably the electrical contact from which current is transmitted from the
alternator to the battery, failed.  Pat Collins tells me that if this is
improperly connected it will quickly fry, as it can carry some 90 amps.
Intermittent charging apparently prevented the fault from showing up on the
diagnostic computer.  God forbid that a 'technician' should look inside an
engine compartment.  For my money I prefer red blooded mechanics to
technicians. One downside to warranties is that we have to rely on
technicians.  Pat will have my car while I am on holiday, and I am confident
that with his help I will have as many years of happy motoring as I have had
in the 356.  Unfortunately I have missed a week of beautiful weather for
open air driving.  Perhaps January will offer us Georgians more such
weather.  Scott
