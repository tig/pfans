To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere=85),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had to=
ns
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too=85 after all, the way the police is checking now a days it'=
s
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny =96
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones eith=
er
(look mom, no hands=85 look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can g=
et
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with o=
ur
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know=85

I currently own 96 328 I conv and 91 300 ZX and find my 98 Boxster is an
extension (considerable) of the finer qualities of both cars.  More refined
than the ZX, more fun than the 328i, also, smaller, sportier, and really new!
It has its own design (which I also like about the ZX).
Decision has to come from the heart, not the checkbook.  It's like sailing, it
always costs money, you can't look at the cost per day of use!  Its not the
destination but the drive there that counts.
The more recent ads from Nissan tried to convey that story (too bad they ran
those ads AFTER cancelling production of ZX)
