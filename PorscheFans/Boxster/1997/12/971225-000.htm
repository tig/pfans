I'll pass on the swamp land, thank you.

However, there may be some truth about getting rings to seat correctly.  
I do not know about all 911 series engines, but Bruce Anderson did 
mention in a recent article of Excellence [February, 1988, pp. 82] that 
some of the 993 engine rings refused to seat properly.  Perhaps, if Mr. 
Anderson is reading the mail, he could elaborate.  The mystery is why, 
then, does Porsche ship their new cars with synthetic if it is better to 
use standard oil initially?

I know that Porsche also specifies a maximum oil consumption for their 
cars of 1 liter every 600 miles.  That seems excessive, and neither of my 
older Porsches use that much oil, but that is what Porsche specifies.

Merry Christmas!
