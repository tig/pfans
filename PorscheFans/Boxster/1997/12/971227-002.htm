That someone was me and I can only guess why Porsche specifies such a 
high consumption number, but I will not.

I can direct the readres to a paper written by Ed Hacket 
(edh@maxey.unr.edu) on this subject which was written specifically for 
our subject titled "More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About Motor Oil".

Hacket addresses issues of oil deposits (among others) or the ash content 
(% sulfated ash) in every motor oil that is directly responsible for the 
sludge and other gunk known to lurk in the innards of our motors.  The 
lower ash content the better.  

Some examples would be with Amsoil, Castrol and Valvoline oils.

@ 15W-40W
Amsoil => 0.5%
Castrol Standard => 1.3%
Valvaline Turbo => 0.99%
@ 10W-30W
Amsoil => < 0.5%
GTX => .85%
Valvoline Turbo => 0.99%

As you can see the ash content is superior with Amsoil oils.  This helps 
explain why they feel they need to charge their high price.  I do not 
have data for Mobil 1, but they offer a phone number for customers (800 
9MOBILE1).

There has been an artical in Excellence magazine about oil
