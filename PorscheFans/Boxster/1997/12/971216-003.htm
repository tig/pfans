Steve,

He's not exactily right but has the right idea. European radio stations
broadcast on the even tenths of a MHz and American stations broadcast on the
odd tenths of a MHz. If it was a European radio with a digital tuner you
might only be able to tune to 98.2, 98.4, 98.6, etc but Porsche wouldn't put
that type of radio in a car destined for the US. Does this make any sense?

Actually the surface has to be somewhere between mirror smooth and slightly
rough.
Too smooth and the seal has nothing to 'bite', too rough and the seal is not
made.  One bit either way and you get a leak.
Seal has to have some texture to get a bite.

I'm doing my 15K oil change Wednesday nite, mighty interested in what I find
under the skirt when I open it up.
