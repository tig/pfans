I've had my Boxster since the August, and I've always noticed that the
radio's reception seemed quite poor - much poorer than my stock Explorer and
Corolla stereos.  Even when I'm within a mile or two of a radio tower, the
reception for that station is still a bit staticy.  I was in a stereo store
the other day and brought it up to the salesman.  He *seemed* to know a lot
about Beckers and said that in Germany the radio stations are located at
0.05 MHz off from the stations in the United States.  Meaning that when I
tune to something like 99.9, the Becker really tunes to 99.95 (just enough
to make it a little staticy).  I'm thinking that Porsche and Becker would be
smarter than this.  Does anyone know if this is true?
