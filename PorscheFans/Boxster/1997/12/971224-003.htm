I heard a similar story about Mobile 1, or any synthetic for that matter, 
and not using it for the initial break in period.

Besides the requirement to allow for the rings to seat in, the other 
important point was concerning oil seals and gaskets.  It seams that 
synthetic will leak like a fountain when introduced into an engine 
running conventional oils for long periods.

Once the rings have seated, switching to synthetic is fine.  However, for 
older engines, weak links in the seals and gaskets seem to provide 
avenues of escape using synthetic.

Our local mechanic thought that deposits laid down by conventional oils 
are scrubbed away by the synthetic oils.  For older engines that rely on 
these deposits to fill tiny voids in gaskets and seals, it quickly spells 
trouble.  I can attest to this personally as both of my vehicles had 
minor leaks that became quite a bit worse after introduction to Mobile 1.

Since that time I replaced all of the offending gaskets and seals in my 
Turbo (the normally aspirated car is next) and Mobile 1 has not leaked at 
all.

I prefer Mobile 1 in Turbos due to the higher heat produced by the motor, 
but I am unconvinced of any benefit for a standard motor, as of yet.  Of 
course, if you run any motor in a rough duty environment such as racing, 
I would run synthetic and fix any leaks as they appear.

>> The service tech screwed up by not offering me the choice and by not

>> 
>> So, contrary to the thread going around, Barrier will install Mobil 1,
