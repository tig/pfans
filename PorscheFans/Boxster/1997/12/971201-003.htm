I too am on the list, nearing the day I must elect.  I have also taken
a second look, mainly at the Jag convertible.  I am also taking
European delivery and noticed the different treatment between BMW and
Porsche's programs.  However, the Porsche $1150 includes insurance for
two weeks of driving pleasure in Europe and additional converage can
be obtained through Porsche for nominal amounts.  I do not know if BMW
is offering insurance AND a ten percent discount.  For all my soul
searching, I am still bonded to the Boxster.  I really do like its
appearance.  I join others that wish it had more power but I now see
that I can buy a turbo kit for my 89 Miata ($2375) which boosts the
116 hp basic engine to 175 hp.  Perhaps this same add on will soon be
available for the Boxster.
