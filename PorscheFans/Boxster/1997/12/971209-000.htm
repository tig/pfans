The Imperial Palace is taking our reservations for April 17 & 18. Please
don't procrastinate - early birds get the rooms! ($79 + 9% room tax).
Questions on room facilities/cancellation should be asked when you
reserve. Call 1-800-634-6441 - ask for Reservation Agent Blue; refer to
Boxster Gathering, Porsche Club. You are responsible for all
room/incidental charges you incur. You can come early and get the same
rate; you can reserve just Friday, April 17, BUT YOU CANNOT reserve just
Saturday, April 18.

Some of you sent info about yourselves. A short bio from the rest of you
would be welcome (car specs, hometown, occupation and interests). 

We can get golf shirts (much better quality than T-shirts) with a very
special logo for this Boxster Event (kindly volunteered by one of us)
done for ~$20 if there is enough interest. Please send a yea (quantity,
size S, M, L, XL, XXL) or nay to Mark Lysinger (with your bio?). Payment
would have to be in advance; no refunds. When we order the setup, we're
committed!

For anybody wondering WHAT event, please check top of Boxster.org page,
Porsche Pete's site ("The Boxsters Have Landed - A Gathering" appears
randomly), or Berkeley Johnston's site. If you'll have your Boxster by
mid April and can make it to Las Vegas, e-mail Mark Lysinger -
mlys@cyberramp.net - and join this group!
