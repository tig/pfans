Hi, David,

Here in PCA Zone 1, we have decided that the Boxster must have a SCCA
approved rollbar or a PCA Club Racing approved rollbar which extends
above the top of the driver and passenger helmets by 2 inches.

Keep in mind that each region of PCA sets its own rules and regulations
for their own driver ed and time trial events. There may be some regions
out there that may allow Boxsters to run without additional protection
for its occupants, but those regions will probably be the ones that are
disbanded when the first rollover occurs in one of their events and 
the occupant is injured...

Rollovers do occur, and that is why cabriolets and speedsters require
rollbars.  In the case of the boxster, additional rollbar height is 
what it's going to take to make it acceptable to the people who run
the driver ed events.

The short answer is, if you don't have an approved rollbar in your Boxster,
don't waste your time or money applying to our events, because you will
not be allowed to run.

George Beuselinck
Registrar, Zone 1 48 Hours at Watkins Glen
