I received my Boxster mats from Automotion today.  They appear to be
of very high quality, have deep pile and nice embroidery for the
script logo "Boxster".  Mine are black with red script.  They are
obviously made custom for the Boxster, although I can't tell how well
they fit because my Boxster is in storage about 100mi from here for
another week or so.  They have a fastening system to keep them from
moving around on the floor, in addition to a rubberized backing to
minimize motion.  They seem very stiff, although perhaps that is a
good thing.  I paid something like $109, I think-- about half the
Porsche price.  I'll let you know if they don't fit well when I get
them in the Boxster.

The box says "Manufactured by Lloyd Design Corp., under license from
Porsche Cars North America".

Jim says: thumbs up.

I also got an automotion Boxster ultralon cover which I'll try in a
couple weeks too.
