Mr. Harris is very happy with his door sills.  As I recall, his car is
silver so the metal sills probably blend in with the silver color of
the car very will.

My car is Guards red.  I'm worried that the silver door sills will
look a little strange against the red paint -- as if they are a cheap
aftermarket part.  Does anyone have the metal door sills on a
non-silver car?  Do they look "right"?  Worth getting?

Thanks for any advice.

I got an unexpected FedEx package from Porsche yesterday.  It included
a short videotape on how to use some of the features of the Boxster as
well as Patrick Stewart (Jean-Luc Picard) telling me how smart and
unique I am to have purchased a Porsche.  There was also a key fob you
can put on your keyring so that Porsche will pay for return postage if
your keys ever get lost.  Cute.  They also included a full-line
brochure in the hopes that it will make me run out and buy a 911 Turbo
in addition to my Boxster...
