My Dad tells me that he was *just* about to buy either a Cadillac
Eldorado or a Lincoln Continental when he saw (a light shines down from
heaven and the angels begin to sing) the 1969 911T Targa (tangerine) on
the Porsche lot (in Pasadena... Rusnak?). All three cars cost about the
same... $8,500 to $9,000. In today's dollars (using the price of CA
homes as a gauge) that's about $40,000. So the Boxster is about where
the early 911's were in price. The 911's have doubled.

My Mom was dead against the Porsche, but now agrees that it was the best
purchase they ever made. He has driven the 71 911T Targa to work every
day (the '69 was stolen from LAX) and has had hardly a problem. We were
recently discussing my Boxster purchase and he said, "You're not buying
a car, this is a life-experience." What a great father!
