Folks,

I am not sure where this all started. But the Boxter is a real Porsche. So
is the 911, 914, 924, 944, 968, and 928. The only question left to ask is
whether or not any one of these models is a Porsche that floats your boat. 
I personally like the 911 and 928. Does that mean I think the other models
are not Porsches? Of course not. This is really a semantics thing. When
most people say a particular model is not a real Porsche, I would guess
they really mean it is not the model that says "PORSCHE" to them.

Another thread to kill....

> On the subject of a Boxster either being or not being a real Porsche, I humbly submit, does it matter?  Do those of you who own Boxsters care what the rest of the world does or doesn't think?  I think it would be unfortunate if people bought the car on the hopes to create a desired impression on the rest of the world.  I have driven (a few times), the Boxster, park next to one about every day, and I find it's a great, beautiful car (and no, I don't own one).  It is a Porsche, for whatever that means to each individual; however, it is neither a 924 nor a 959, it is unique in its own right.  Certainly one rational argument for worrying if the Boxster will be "accepted" as a real Porsche centers around resale value, and from what I have seen and read, that shouldn't be a problem for the next few years.  Until time determines Boxster's place in automotive history, a few lucky guys I know are content to drive 'em and have a lot of fun.
