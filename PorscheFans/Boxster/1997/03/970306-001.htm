I have had a Boxster (P-16,P-38) for one month. I am sorry I have not joined
in on the Boxster chat. Please forgive me!! 
I have over 2500 miles on it and 3 days of track time at Roebling Road in
Savannah, GA.   I have R-1s installed on 7.5 inch and 9 inch aftermarket
wheels.  Fit is good.  Car has a great tendency to under steer on the track
with R-1s. Only correction was with tire pressures.  Final pressures were  24
psi front cold, 30psi rear, cold. This helped the under steer.  My times were
the same as my 83 911, modified. Not too bad the first time out.  R-1s were
excellent. Played with traction control ON and OFF and did not get light to
come on.  Does that mean there is more to be had of this car?
Problems so far, replaced rear tail light assembly on inside of car, bad
circuit.
Broke one of the tabs holding the plexiglass windscreen on.  No oil added so
far.
Beware, as I was putting up the top (live in FL) I noticed that the latching
handle was very hard to work.  
Cause, the fabric as it fits in the plastic channel over the window was
hanging out over the plastic. Fix, inside the car, there is a small  black
elastic strip sewed on one end and a plastic pin on the other end. The
plastic end snaps into a female holder.  This pin had come out of the holder.
 Its purpose is to pull the fabric into the channel above the window.  It has
happened twice.  The elastic will not last one summer here in FL. It will
lose its elasticity and the top will not work.  I promise to chat more.
