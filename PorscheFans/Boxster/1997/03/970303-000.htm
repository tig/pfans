Hello, Porschefans!!

After a recent visit to my dealership, I discovered that Porsche is
shipping the Boxster 17" wheels with three different tires! They had three
new Boxsters in for delivery, all three with the sport package incl. the
17's, and one was wearing Michelins, one Pirellis and one sporting
Bridgestones!

According to the sales manager, Porsche has three different contracts for
the bigger rubber (on top of the Conti's for the stock 16s), and it's
really a crapshoot which one you'll end up with. They don't seem to be able
to specify to PCNA or the factory what to put on the car.

Nevertheless, I can't help wanting to know which is preferable. The
Bridgestones had the most impressively aggressive tread pattern by far and
looked like show-car tires, but how do all these tires figure in the
grip/wear equation? Does anyone know more about them (beyond simply brand
preference)? Also didn't think to jot down the model designation of each,
if anyone has that handy.

Also: Does anyone have the model number for the Sony 6-CD changer that's
supposed to be compatible with the stock Boxster stereo? Has anyone out
there tried to have it installed without the pre-wiring from the upgraded
sound system? Any problems?

Thanks!
Phil. (Late March delivery, barring delays! :^>  )
