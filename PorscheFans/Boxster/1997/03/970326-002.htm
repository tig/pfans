Dear Perci Hala:

In regards to your comment:=20

"Thanks, but no thanks!  I subscribe to all (I think) of the lists in =
digest, but only the Boxster list in detail because I want to hear what =
other BOXSTER owners are experiencing,and share info with them. With the =
exception of model years and a few suspension components, what =
experiences could I share with 993s?  Maybe a Newcar' list would fit =
your needs better?"

It is unfortunate that your view is so narrow.  I think there is more in =
common than you might think, as they are new cars, and hence many of the =
questions concerning them are of a new car nature.  If there were a =
"NewCar@ProscheFans.com," then yes, that would probably fit many of the =
993 owners' needs just great; however, last time I looked, there wasn't. =
 The Boxster list is as close as it comes, and I share much more in =
common with Boxsters than I do with owners of  914's, 924's, 944's, =
911's and so on.  I guess I have a different view--had you told me you =
wanted to participate in a 993 list, I'd have said "great, new view =
point, and who knows what the possibilities could be."
