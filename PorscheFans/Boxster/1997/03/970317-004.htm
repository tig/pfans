Hello List:  a recent post sought advise concerning the hardtop 
purchase.  I definitely think it is worth the $2,200 price.  First of 
all with regard to soft top "storage" during the winter months.  You 
must make absolutely sure it is completely dry before it is put down. 
I also have previously placed very soft cotton towels between the 
folds of plastic windows to cushion them during this process.  Even 
when down there is some movement and because of the method of the 
fold, in the middle of the window, the window can rub against itself. 
 These swirls can be polished out, but the towels do work to cushion 
the window and prevent rubbing.  Once the hard top is on the soft top 
is completely protected from the elements.  I say buy it.  My car 
came without a hardtop and I will buy the first old available either 
thru parts or from a supposed donor car.  Seems donor car may not 
arrive due to allocation reductions.  Oh well, got to be spring some 
time up here north of Boston.  Regards, William Harris
