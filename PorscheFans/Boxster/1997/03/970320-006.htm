I tend to disagree with the assessment that the boxster is not a real porsche 
because it doesn't have a blindingly fast 0-60 time...there are many cars 
that are quick off the line (the Z28 or corvette come to mind) that are 
nothing more to me than an engine bolted onto a cheaply built car. People 
shouldn't buy porsches for the image, they should buy them because they love 
to drive them. I have not personally drove a boxster, but from what I have 
read it is a superb car, especially in the realm of handling and fun to 
drive. A car is good not just because of its performance but also what the 
car's "personality" is like...a 911SC is not a blindingly fast car yet it is 
still a lot of fun to drive.
