I've owned my silver/black tiptronic since early Jan  (one of the first, if
not the first, Boxster delivered in U.S.)  It has been a sheer pleasure to
drive... with not one problem to date - except for the throngs of people who
want drool all over it whenever it's parked.

Anyway. I'd like some advice.   I love the look of the 40-bolt turbo style
wheel that was on the Boxster prototype (they were 18" speedlines).
  Speedline now has 8X17"  three-piece wheels supposedly fitted for the
Boxster (even though the standard wheel is 7X17").   Gemballa and Tech Art
also have 17" wheels that are made for the Boxster.
   
I am aware of Porsche's warning against using any wheel but their own. What
do you think?  Could it harm the car?  Suspension?  Anyone hear of Porsche
coming out with a 40 bolt wheel?

Also, several dealers  around the country are modifing Boxster mufflers to
increase sound (the one offered in LA inceases backpressure by 17%).  It
sounds great but... good idea or back idea ? (All of the work is behind the
CAT).

Thanks for your help.  To those of you waiting - you won't be let down.  As a
previous owner of a BMW 2002, GTO, 914-6, and M3 I can assure you this car is
extraordinary.
