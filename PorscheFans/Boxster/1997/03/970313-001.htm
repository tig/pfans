....Whelp, that little tickle of the latch switch for the top was a bust after
all.
The top is still nonfunctional.  Runs, stops, runs, stops, waits, runs.  Then
stops for good, half way up.
Making an appointment with the shop to leave it there for a day.  

Has anyone got these kind of annoyances from their top?
**********
Raining like heck today in Central Florida.  The car is amazing in these
conditions, just as sure footed as one could want.  
Buckets of rain in standing pools on the roadway, mixed in with leaves, makes
for slippery going.  
Carving a turn like I would in the dry (away from traffic mind you) the car
sticks very well, surprisingly well.
Yeah sure, it breaks loose, but all within tolerance- very manageable.

Although NOSUBT2 here may have input otherwise (he got the P38 package), I
cannot but wonder aloud why anyone would want the traction control option.  
But, in having read the Service Information Technik book on the subject, I
realize it is a very, very sophisticated application of the science.  
My naive thinking is, once you get the car that far to the edge, it's going
to go over anyway, traction control or not.
