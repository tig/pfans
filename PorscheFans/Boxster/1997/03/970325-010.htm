Having just purchased a 993 C4S, I can testify that 993 coupes are
selling, but 911 cab sales are languishing a bit compared to forecast.
The dealer I worked with in CA attributes this to the Boxter.  I'm sure
he'll order fewer 993 (or 996) cabs in the future once the split between
Boxter/993 cab is better understood.

If you want to deal on a 993 cab vs. a boxter, I'm sure many dealers
would be willing to go under MSRP by a significant amount (talk with
Simon at Beverly Hills Porsche) on the cab.

	Sluggish 993 Sales? I don't think so.

	The Boxsters went on sale in mid-January and they are already
outselling the
	911 model. The February 1997 sales show an increase of 105% over
February
	1996 and the combined Boxster 911 sales are up 148% year to date
over the
	1996 sales. Total sales were 1051 Porsches for February 1997 as
compared to
	511 Porsches in February 1996. The total sales year to day for
both the
	Boxster and the 911 were  2329 Porsches year to date for 1997
compared to 941
	year to date for 1996. They have sold 1016 Boxsters year to date
and 1310
	911s year to date as compared to 938 total Porsches year to date
for 1996.
