   OK, I need some help from the group. My dealer here in Denver claims that
   I won't see my Boxster until probably late August. Keep in mind that I
   put my deposit down January 20th of this year and was put on the list at
   #39. At that time I was told that it would be delivered in late
   spring/early summer. When I've asked him in the past how I've moved up on
   the list he can't seem to give me a definite answer. From what I can tell
   this dealer has only delivered 2-4 cars since January while across town a
   rival dealer tells me they've delivered about 10 cars. What gives? I
   don't mind waiting as long as I know how long the wait is. Any advice?
   I'm about to tell them to shove it! In fact the dealer can't even tell me
   if I'll be pushed to the 1998 model year and the inevitable price
   increase. He keeps speaking in glittering generalities ("let's get over
   the spring hump"..."I don't THINK you'll be looking at a '98"...).

Your dealer may be correct.  I got on my dealer's list as of June 1996.  Mine
is position #27 out of 75.  My delivery will probably be May (of this year).
 Although my  dealer's allocation is 75 units its expectation is that only 60
units will arrive in model year 1997.  #39 at my dealer would be about a July
delivery. If your dealer's allocation is less than 75 units then your
delivery would be even later, more than 75 units then probably earlier.  If
you want to check out the competition look at the ads in AutoWeek.  I believe
I saw at least one promoting availability (when?) of Boxsters.  BTW  I rather
experience a delay than take delivery of a vehicle that might not measure up
to my expectations of a Porsche.  If  Mr. P. needs a bit more time to get it
right then so be it.
