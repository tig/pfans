Hello Boxster List:  Just learned that PCNA reports their best sales 
since July 1988 as a result of the Boxster release.  Seems that US 
Boxsters delivered totaled over 660 units during January.  It is 
already apparant to everyone that Boxster is a major success for 
Porsche AND it has definitely cut into 993 sales.
     Got my Boxster Aluminum door sills from Champion Porsche Monday 
and installed them immediately.  Cost $378 including everything.  
This is definitely an item the car should have as standard equipment. 
 You see these door sills in most of the ads and the Boxster booklet. 
 They are in very limited supply, so if you want them order now.
   Two sites to recommend:  Scottsdale Porsche has a large number of 
good Boxster options with pictures taken from the Arizona launch:  
http://www.scottsdalejag.com/boxster.html.  Also, this British owner 
has some interesting observations of his Boxster vs. 993:

     Hey, what's with the other 400 people on this list?  Maybe Jim 
and I should just phone each other?  Anyway, my car will easily pass 
2,000 miles this week.  Added 1 quart of oil and washed it for the 
first time this weekend.  Here's a suggestion, don't use a chammy 
(chamois) ? on the soft top.  Mine is real leather and it left a 
terrible fuzz until the next couple of days rain washed it off.  
Also, cleaning the inside of the plastic window is very tough to 
reach and the damn thing will scratch with any roughness.  I used a 
damp cotton baby diaper (got a 11 month old) and it still left some 
faint swirl marks.  I noticed in the Technique manual that the rear 
window alone can NOT be renewed.  What the hell, when it goes we have 
to replace the whole soft top.  Regards, William Harris
