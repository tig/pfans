Just received word from a friend who ordered his Boxster 3 years ago. It
finally arrived at the dealer's and, during prep, had an electrical fire in
the wiring harness between the dash and the door. Fortunately he had not paid
for it yet. So instead of the smell of new leather there is the odor of burnt
wiring, and of course there is no replacement part available for the
partially melted harness, nor is there a mechanic (excuse me; technician) who
has ever done this job before on a Boxster. I think he's going to tell the
dealer to sell it to someone else.
Has anyone out there had or heard of electrical problems in the Boxster?
