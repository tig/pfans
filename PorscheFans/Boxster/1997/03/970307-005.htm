Random Thoughts:

1.  Got the stainless steel thresholds with Boxster logo today from
Champion Porsche, delivered 3 days after I faxed them order request and
payment instructions.  I now have Jesse from parts on my autodialer,
along with his fax number.  Have a feeling I'll be talking to him again.
Thanks William H for the tip! 

2. I also received my mats today from automation.  Black with red
boxster script.  Took 2 weeks from order to delivery, looks great, fits
like they were made for the car (surprise!)  They have hooks that fasten
to the front holes of the seat rails to keep them from moving.  First
class, and less than half the offical porsche price.  Nice work
Automation.

3.  Based on William's comments, I've ordered the Service Technique
manuel.  I also found ads in this months issue of Excellence for the
full service set, 10 volumes, $530+.  Anybody seen these, have any idea
of their value?

4. Had a problem with the top yesterday, top retracted but warning light
never went out.  Tried cycling the system several times, light went out
when fully up, but not when retracted.  Swung by the dealer on the way
home, the service team came out to take a look. First the team debated
if the light was supposed to go out when the top was down, (I finally
pulled out the owners manual and showed them the answer to that
question), finally admitted they hadn't seen this problem, and were not
quite sure what to do, but said the would give it a look.  Finally
played with the retaining sockets, which fixed the problem and got the
rear deck to lay down evenly, without a gap ->NOW it looks like the
brochure!  

5. Anybody know what is required to take out the front storage console? 
I'm talking about the small storage console that sits in front of the
shifter and fills the gap between the dash and the floor?  I want to
open the car up a little and give myself a little more leg room.  Dealer
is not sure about the connection, but is willing to give it a try.  I
want to make sure I don't tear up the inside or leave big holes in the
dash/carpet.

This car is great.  I get a lot of questions, asking what is, how fast,
etc.  It was worth the wait.  Dealer says rumors of turbo version can
not be confirmed, but indicated that he thought s model would be
released this time next year.  At any rate, it's a winner.

Cheers, RC
