Sluggish 993 Sales? I don't think so.

The Boxsters went on sale in mid-January and they are already outselling the
911 model. The February 1997 sales show an increase of 105% over February
1996 and the combined Boxster 911 sales are up 148% year to date over the
1996 sales. Total sales were 1051 Porsches for February 1997 as compared to
511 Porsches in February 1996. The total sales year to day for both the
Boxster and the 911 were  2329 Porsches year to date for 1997 compared to 941
year to date for 1996. They have sold 1016 Boxsters year to date and 1310
911s year to date as compared to 938 total Porsches year to date for 1996.
