I have been reading this page for about two months.  I took delivery of my
silver and red Boxster last Sat.  I sold my 86 944T for it.  I must admit to
having a lot of difficulty with that decision.  Now that it is made, it is
clearly the right one.  The Boxster is the most fun I have had with my clothes
on.  Tenacious grip, sophisticated design and drive train.  I have only 200
miles and have some of the problems that have been described by some of you.
The trunk light remains on until I drive some distance and last night in a
fairly heavy rain, I had a leak at the joint between the top and body which came
down the window.  I'll have it looked at and report back.

But to the reason for the e-mail. I am looking for someone who took delivery of
an arctic silver with hard top who does not want the top. I will pay your list
price.  Contact me at 10727,1337@compuserve.com.
