  Thank you for your views on the 993 vs. the Boxster. I'm sorry if I came
  across in a "flippant" way. That wasn't my intent. And I apologize for
  posting to 911/Boxster instead of the Tavern list. I guess you learn by
  doing. My questions were valid though. I really do want to get both sides
  of the equation. This will be our first Porsche and as a "car guy" who
  used to race with the SCCA in showroom stock C for four seasons yes I
  have done some "personal homework". I just haven't spoken to any actual
  owners. I look at the postings here on PorscheFans but really haven't
  been able to glean very much. As far as my supercharging the ti if BMW
  made them with a six I would have had the six! Unfortunately too many
  people with six cylinder cars see modified fours and then get all riled
  up. I see this in BMWCCA all the time. I happen to prefer the hatchback
  body style and the 300 pounds lighter weight. The M3 is awesome. But so
  is a modified ti. And no I didn't put the "M" badge on it. That comment
  was rather insulting to me. I happen to police that "M" badge all the
  time. You do need to be careful though. For example a blue ti turned up
  at work with an "M" badge on it. I found the owner and gently inquired
  about the badge. I was told that the car was purchased in Germany (this
  was verified, she had just been reassigned in my company from Dusseldorf
  and her husband is in the USAF) and that the dealer over there installed
  an M-technic suspension. This is an option similar in the US to the
  sport/club-sport ti. So the "M" was valid. What I don't like are the body
  parts with "M" painted on them. In fact I am thinking of getting the
  factory rear wing, which is unpainted but has an "M" badge on it, and
  painting over the logo. I just don't deserve to have it on my car and I
  know it.  So now you know something about me and that your impressions
  were completely wrong. Since you offered it in your post, your apology is
  accepted.

  See ya,

  Bob H.
