Greetings all,

In my efforts to replace my white tiptronic with a silver non-tip, I've
talked to lots of dealers and brokers around the country.  Many claim
that they have seen a relaxation of the allocation squeeze they were
feeling just 30 day ago, however my local dealer continues to have  a
different story. 

I've also been surprised at the number of people I've talked to that
have gone ahead and put 18 inch wheels on the car, the factory warning
not withstanding.  Most have told me that Porsche always warns against
aftermarket parts that Porsche is not yet producing (sound kits are
another often sited example of this fact).  Can any of our long term
Porschefans confirm this?  Those who have 18" wheels claim the car takes
on a whole new look, and that once you've seen one you'll never go back.

I've also noticed that broker prices appear to be dropping.  Some of the
folks I talked to who a month ago would consider nothing less than 5k
over MSRP are now asking 3k and when pushed, two said they'd take 2k. 
What is everyone else seeing?

On a more mundane note, like other's on the list I'm trying to find the
elusive sony 6disc CD changer that interfaces with the Becker/Sony
single CD dash unit.  The local car audio dealer tried to help, but we
could not find the tools to remove the unit from the dash.  The manual
says they are shipped with the car, but I've turned the car upside down
and could not find them, and my local Porsche dealer is closed.  Anybody
have any idea where those things are stored, as well as any model
numbers on the correct sony unit?
