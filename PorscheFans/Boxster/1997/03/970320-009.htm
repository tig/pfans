Every Boxster is equiped with wiring for the air bag cut off on the passenger
side.   The system requires an adaptor (which is fitted under the seat) and
the child seat itself which will be offered in three sizes (infant, toddler,
booster).  The dealers will be offically informed of the offering in approx 8
weeks.  The dealers are in the dark because Prosche did not want to announce
their system until all Government regulations were met.  Also, Prosche will
be selling the system at close to cost because of their commitment to child
safety.

As to the argument about real what constitutes a real prosche - all I know
it's the best looking, best handling, most affordable and most fun car this
great company has ever produced.  No matter, I am still willing to accept the
911 as a real Porsche too.
