     OK, I need some help from the group. My dealer here in Denver claims 
     that I won't see my Boxster until probably late August. Keep in mind 
     that I put my deposit down January 20th of this year and was put on 
     the list at #39. At that time I was told that it would be delivered in 
     late spring/early summer. When I've asked him in the past how I've 
     moved up on the list he can't seem to give me a definite answer. From 
     what I can tell this dealer has only delivered 2-4 cars since January 
     while across town a rival dealer tells me they've delivered about 10 
     cars. What gives? I don't mind waiting as long as I know how long the 
     wait is. Any advice? I'm about to tell them to shove it! In fact the 
     dealer can't even tell me if I'll be pushed to the 1998 model year and 
     the inevitable price increase. He keeps speaking in glittering 
     generalities ("let's get over the spring hump"..."I don't THINK you'll 
     be looking at a '98"...).

     Dealers that sold a lot of Porsche Cars last year get an increased 
     amount of Boxsters ..
     My dealer in Mass was origionally allocated 15 boxsters for 97 as they 
     sold a lot of 911's last year .
     
     If the dealer manages to sell off Extra 911's in 97 he gets allocated 
     more boxster spots ...as 911's are not selling as easilly now the 
     Boxster is out ..
     
     I would definetly speak to a few dealers before you tell them to shove 
     it ..
     I overheard my salesman telling a customer if he puts a deposit down 
     today it he will probably drive away in august with the car ..
     
     My dealership mainly deals in Porsches and My local porsche dealership 
     i was not impressed with ...I'll tell you why ..
     
     They already sold the Red demo model ...This tells you the dealership 
     is out for the Quick buck ...and has no model other than customer cars 
     to let possible customers drive ....I hope it wouldnt be my new 
     boxster joe shmo is getting to demo ...
     
     they mainly cell Chevys and hondas ...
     
     Nice mix ??? 
     
     Call around you may be able to get it from a dealer quicker than you 
     think .. 
     I got bumped to the top of the list as most people in front of me were 
     not Financially ready for delivery so soon .
     
     Good luck ..
