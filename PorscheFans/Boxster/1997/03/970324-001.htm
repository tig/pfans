The techical Info bulletin I have says nothing about the above question.
 However, it does state "Use of aftermarket wheels or wheel
accessories(spacers etc.) or non-OEM wheel bolts on Boxster vehicles is not
approved."
"Only the standard wheel bolts can be used to securely mount the wheels to
the vehicle. "  I take it to mean that whatever wheel you use, it must use
the standard bolt.  I and the service manager of the dealer examined the
radius of the Boxster bolt and the radius of the 911 nut and where they meet
the wheel they appear to be the same diameter and radius.  I used the Boxster
bolts on the after market wheels.
 Q.  Furthermore, Porsche says that if you put on aftermarket wheels and
bolts you may cause serious harm to the car.   Keep in mind they're referring
to both 18" and 17" wheels. 
Again, quote from Porsche " Eighteen inch wheels are not approved for use on
the Boxsters."  I would not use the 18inch as it has been known to bend the
steering rack on 911s.  I would use the Boxster bolts on 17 inch aftermarket
wheels and do not use any larger tire.  Good luck and let me know the
outcome.
