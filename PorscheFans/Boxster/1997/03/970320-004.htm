I was at Barrier Motors in Bellevue, WA yesterday. According to them,
the current crop of Boxsters do not have the infant seat capability
yet... it's coming soon. And there is no other switch to disable the
air-bag. I wouldn't be surprised, though, if the wiring was there.

As for US Govt. approval? There's a new F150 here at work with a
dash-board mounted key disable switch, so maybe the hold up is at
Porsche's end. Or the Govt. is approving each car (or class of auto)
independently.

Incidentally, it is incredible how many Boxsters are being sold up in
rainy Washington. Mostly Microsoft guys, they said. Still they are
moving five times more than here on the sunny Central Coast in San Luis
Obispo and Santa Barbara. Of course, they're all equipped with hard
tops.
