What fun! Had a Miata before and this is definitely a qauntum leap up.
Took it to a PCA driving school last weekend and had a blast. The only
Boxster there so it got a lot of attention and all of the instructors
wanted to ride with me and then drive it. I was quite gracious and let
several of them give it a run--they were all impressed with how well it
handled--very neutral and with the power--most had the impression that
it was underpowered from reading mags, but changed their mind after
driving. I got to drive a 944 set up for autocrossing and a 911 SC also
heavy into autocrossing just to see the difference. The Boxster is much
smoother in all respects and definitely holds the road better. I
probably left about 2k miles of tire on the parking lot of Jack Murphy
stadium in San Diego, but it was well worth it. What you realize from a
school like this is just how much further the limits are than you
realize driving it on the streets. The instructors were also blown away
by the stopping power and the control under ABS braking. They had an
accident avoidance exercise where you jam the breaks to avoid cones and
then turn out at the last minute--it was awesome.

As others have mentioned, you gets lots of looks and lots of questions
and people in minivans seem compelled to go exceedingly fast whenever
you are around them on the freeway!

I would also recommend the tech book--lots of detail and interesting
even for someone like myself who is not necessarily very mechanically
inclined. You learn things like--the A/c compressor turns off
automatically under hard acceleration--pretty exciting huh?

Problems so far:
1. check engine light came on for a couple of days then went off--the
computer registered a couple of engine misfires, that were not repeated
and did not appear to cause a problem--they just reset it. The engine
has always run flawlessly and I did not feel any engine misfiring when
they happened--of course the computer knows exactly when and how fast
you were going when it happened--I hope the police don't get hold of
these things.
2. air bag light is now on. Took it in yesterday and the fault was at
the belt buckle though there is not an apparent problem. They reset it
and it came on again before I got around the block. They have a call
into Porsche to try to figure it out. Other than that, all is well--I
did have to put 1 qt of oil in it at about 1500 miles. It set for a few
days while I was out of town and when I came back and started it--big
puff of smoke out the exhaust that nearly choked me before I got out of
the garage, but it does not do that routinely.
