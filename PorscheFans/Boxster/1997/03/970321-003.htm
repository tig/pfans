I can't believe this question of "is it a REAL Porsche".  Horsepower alone
doesn't make spit.  My '65 356 SC Coupe would have a hard time beating most
new cars off the line, but it IS a REAL Porsche, and I have an awful lot of
fun with it on the country roads of NC.  My first Porsche was a '63
normal-only 60hp-but handled like a dream, for that time period.  I'm an
over 50 dinosaur, and may be in the market for a Boxster in the future.
Right now I'm watching, listening, & reading all the info passed in this
venue.  The discussion is interesting.  As far as the reason for the lower
cost on the Boxster:  there was an article in Autoweek, that also appeared
in some non-automotive publications, regarding Porsche's use of Japanese
experts to re-vamp their production processes, inventory control, etc.
Can't give dates, but you might investigate. The article was an eye-opener.
