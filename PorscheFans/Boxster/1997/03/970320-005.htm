Well,
To the risk of sounding very "clich=E9" like, the "real" Porsches are 911=
's.
I was visiting the factory last year on November 11 and was talking to on=
e
of the company managers. He told me that it was not expected to find a 91=
1
driver going to a Boxster for many reasons:
European 911 drivers' profiles are very stereotyped:
Early 40s, the 911 is their daily driver but they usually also have a
sedan (BMW or Mercedes...) and a third city car, they are demanding about
themselves and others, have a family, are not ready to compromise about
much, and pay their cars cash!!! REMEMBER IT'S A STEREOTYPE
(FYI I'm 27 and had to get a loan to buy my car....)
Boxster drivers are younger (early 30s), need to get a loan to buy their
cars, are more preoccupied with the look than anything else, and are
single yuppies.
This already ought to tell you enough about the different driving
experiences ....

For my perception, the boxster is supposed to be the milking cow and the
911 (996 now), the "real thing".

My daily driver is an Alfa Rom=E9o 155 and when I take the C4 out for the
week-end or to go on a track, I'm looking for something "mean" yet "easy"
to drive and of superior quality. The boxster cannot offer that: There's
only half a second difference from 0 to 60 mph between the Boxster and th=
e
Alfa and all other performance figures are in the same range: That just
doesn't sound like a "real" Porsche to me, and although the sound of the
Boxster between 4500 and 5500 RPM is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, you don't get
the kick in the a.. that the Carrera gives you. The inside quality of a
Boxtsre is not even comparable to a Boxster. The car that I tried
yesterday had 10000 miles on the clock and the inside door panels already
looked worn out (now in all fairness it's been driven by many people but
still, it's only 6 months old!). The handling of the Boxster is also
better than that of the Alfa, but with the 17"s in the wet, only just!!!!
There just isnt' enough difference between the Boxster's performance and =
a
"normal" european car.
To the 911's favor is also the fact that it has 2 spare seats. Believe it
or not, My girlfriend and I took the car to Monaco last year with 2 big
Samsonite suitcases at the back of the car. No chance to do that with a
Boxster!!!!
In my very humble opinion, there is just no comparison between the cars.
If I had to make  a choice between a RECENT 911 (max 5 years old) and a
Boxster, I would not hesitate at all, it would be the 911. Do keep in min=
d
however that the resale value of the Boxster might be really good for the
coming 2 years and the 993s will go down because the 996 is coming out in
September!!!!
Let me know what you decide to do.
A last thought: don't make your decision without having tried both and
decided what you really like (The 911 will cost significantly more in
maintenance and insurance... but no water pump to change....)
