Thank goodness the Boxster isn't the same as a 911!

It is my opinion the only persons qualified to comment on the differences or
comparisons between the 911 and Boxster (986) are those of us who have owned
both.  
Merely having a perception of the two doesn't cut it.  I'd rather hear warts
and all, not tops only.

A drive around the block, down the street, or for a whole day in a Boxster
does not impart what ownership is about.  Not by any stretch, okay?
Even mine, at 3,000 miles, is delivering new input to the quotient.  [Each
and every day it gets better to me, as a car, and better than my 911 ever
was.]

If someone wants to split hairs between the 993 & 911 they have every reason
to, the 993 is very different than the older 911.  A better topic for
discussion, the subtle and not so subtle differences between those two;  they
do share major design characteristics.  But it doesn't belong here.

Maybe it was missed somewhere along the way;  the Boxster engine is in the
middle, not the back and it's half as much money to buy.  It's a ROADSTER;
 an open automobile having a single seat in the front for two or three people
and a luggage compartment in the back.
It's not a GTP tube car with 700 h.p., nor airplane without wings.  But then,
neither is a 911 or 993 (is it?)

In considering my purchase I'll admit to NOT having thought about changing
the water pump.  
How could I have been so foolish?!
**************
On another note;  I have it upon good authority Porsche is going to have
future Boxsters assembled in Finland.  As many as 5,000 units per year,
perhaps more.  Anyone else hear this yet?
What's that going to do for values of these (German built) we have now?
What about the finish of a Finnish car?  Are there any Finnish cars??
