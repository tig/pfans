  OK, I need some help from the group. My dealer here in Denver claims that
  I won't see my Boxster until probably late August. Keep in mind that I
  put my deposit down January 20th of this year and was put on the list at
  #39. At that time I was told that it would be delivered in late
  spring/early summer. When I've asked him in the past how I've moved up on
  the list he can't seem to give me a definite answer. From what I can tell
  this dealer has only delivered 2-4 cars since January while across town a
  rival dealer tells me they've delivered about 10 cars. What gives? I
  don't mind waiting as long as I know how long the wait is. Any advice?
  I'm about to tell them to shove it! In fact the dealer can't even tell me
  if I'll be pushed to the 1998 model year and the inevitable price
  increase. He keeps speaking in glittering generalities ("let's get over
  the spring hump"..."I don't THINK you'll be looking at a '98"...).
