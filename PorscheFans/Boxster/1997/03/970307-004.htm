<<Got my Boxster Aluminum door sills from Champion Porsche Monday 
 and installed them immediately.  Cost $378 including everything.  
 This is definitely an item the car should have as standard equipment. 
  You see these door sills in most of the ads and the Boxster booklet. 
  They are in very limited supply, so if you want them order now.>>

Boxster Booklet - Are you talking about the 84 page sales brochure? The one
that features the silver & red Boxster?  Also, are the aluminum door sills
the same as option X70 Stainless steel door entrance with the logo "Boxster"
 (as per the option list dated 14Sep 96)?

<<Hey, what's with the other 400 people on this list?  Maybe Jim 
 and I should just phone each other?  Anyway, my car will easily pass 
 2,000 miles this week.>>

We're still waiting for ours!!!!!!!  #37 (June/July del.) It's hard to keep
repeating "Its coming, its coming I think - Is it coming from Finland !

 <<I noticed in the Technique manual that the rear 
 window alone can NOT be renewed.  What the hell, when it goes we have 
 to replace the whole soft top.  
 >>

I was afraid of that.
