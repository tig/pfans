Pardon my ignorance, but you lowered the front tire pressure to lessen the
understeering effect?? I'd think lowering front tire pressure would have the
opposite effect, i.e. increase understeering.

I have been running higher front tire pressure and lower rear pressure to
lessen the understeering effect in my cars.

Inquiring minds want to know....You were at Roebling road, did you see Steve
Pantieri in his Giulietta, he was one of the instructors?
