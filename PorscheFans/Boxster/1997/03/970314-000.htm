  OK everyone, here's the deal. I want each side of the Boxster/911 debate
  to try and convince me to come over to their camp. I am on the list for a
  Boxster which may (or may not) be delivered in August. I've driven the
  car both at night and in the day, top up and top down (did you know they
  drive differently at night vs. the day? :-) ). Anyway another (better!)
  dealer across town has a '95 993 Carrera with LSD, gorgeous white paint,
  wheels to match and is just basically a nice looking car with about 6500
  miles on it. They are asking 57K. They also have a red '93 RS America in
  really nice shape, 35K miles which I drove and liked. They're asking 42K
  for that one but I bet they could be negotiated into the 30's. The only
  problem with the RSA is that my wife could never handle the 17" wheels
  without power steering. I really had to muscle it in the parking lot (I
  know, what a wimp ;-) ). So here it is. Here is your chance. I'll check
  the archives on Monday morning for your replies. I really want to know
  your thoughts on each car, said in a totally biased way. What are your
  long-term experiences (hard to say for the Boxster crowd). What do you
  think the future holds for each model, from a value standpoint. Please
  let me know...I'm all ears!!
