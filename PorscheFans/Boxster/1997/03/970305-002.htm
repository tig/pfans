> On another note- You Boxster fans, notice the amount of dirt and
> debris the rear tires is kicking up from under the bottom of your rear
> bumper? keep an eye on it before the underside becomes sand blasted.
> As a solution I'm using Stoneguard a product from 3M, it's a 5mm thin
> transparent plastic that you find on a 911 flare rear fenders. I'll
> keep you posted.
