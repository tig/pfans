Hello List:  Noted the recent posts about problems and/or delays with 
deliveries.  This confirms the information I have received from 2 
Boston area dealers and my friend at Champion Porsche in Pompano 
Beach FL (the Worldest Largest = the largest US allocation)  Within 
the last week all US dealers have been advised that the 1997 
allocation will be reduced.  Smaller dealers are hit the hardest.  My 
selling dealer went from 18 Boxsters to 11 Boxsters in 1997 
production.  The sales manager tells me that Boxster demand in Europe 
is so strong that Porsche has decided to sell more cars in Europe (at 
a much higher profit margin) and thus deliver fewer cars to US.  By 
the way, saw a piece in Car and Driver (I think, Or Automobile) that 
Porsche is contracting out 5,000 Boxsters per year to be built in 
Finland.  Seems Zuffenhausen is already at full capacity between 
Boxster and the 993.  For those of you waiting, keep the faith -its 
worth the wait.  You may remember I traded my C4S for the Boxster and 
have never had a second thought.
     On another note, my car is now at 2,000+ miles and over 1 month 
old, so in the truest Porsche tradition I have taken the gloves off 
and decided to drive the car harder.  Wow, keep the revs over 4,000 
rpm and this car really screams.  I love all the wild engine noises 
and the sharp exhaust bark.  Handling is very precise.  Haven't yet 
gotten quite used to the very soft suspensions setting compared to the 
sports chassis in the C4S.  Have observed much higher corner speeds 
and haven't yet approached to point to provoking oversteer.  Hope to 
start the driver's ed and autocross events soon.  Regards, William 
Harris
