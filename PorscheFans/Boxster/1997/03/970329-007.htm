Just saw a color combination that I thought looked sensational -  black
exterior with red interior (and 17" chrome wheels). 

I never would have guessed this particluar combination would appeal to me -
but it did.  It's both unusual and very cool.  The black offers the perfect
contrast with the Boxster red.  Much better, in my opinion, than the
silver/red.  Has anyone else seen or had the confidence to order this color
combo?  

How about the white with red?  Has anyone seen this yet?   The one interior
I'm dying to see is the green.  What color exterior would go with that? Beats
me. 

Also... the May issue of Road and Track reports that the Boxster S will not
be arriving until mid/late '98.  In addition, they say that it will offer a
3.0 liter engine at 245bhp.  If spy photos hold true, it will have a larger
front intake and an "ugly" fixed rear spoiler.  I'll pass, thank you.
