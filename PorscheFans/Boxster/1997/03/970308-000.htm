Had my Boxster on the track yesterday. I'm a member of the Viper Club and
they rented the track at Morossa in Palm Beach. I took the Boxster instead.
Had a great time. The car handled like an NSX on the track. The balance was
great.

I also got the sills and they look great. I'm waiting for the aluminum pedals
to come in. So far about 3600 miles. Added my first quart of oil at 3000
miles. When are you guys going in for your first oil change? I'm not waiting
15000 miles.

Also the book 84 page book says they don't use a standard oil filter, just
change the element. They said this helps save money. The service writer at
Champion was't aware of this. I hope the parts department is.

Dealers should have all service advisers read the 84 page book and get
familiar witrh the car.
