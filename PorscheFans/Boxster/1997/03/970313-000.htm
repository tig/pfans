<<The trunk light remains on until I drive some distance>>
The Owners Manual (a good read, BTW) states the spoiler light on the dash
(not a 'trunk light') stays on until the car has been driven a few feet.  
The spoiler is deployed when the car is at speed, it stands to reason part of
it's circuit check completes when input from the wheel sensor comes in
(probably after a complete revolution).
*******
Top wouldn't go down.  It's an annoying intermittent hair puller, been going
on for a few weeks.
Took it into the shop for repair.  They replaced the dash switch.  Top worked
great, four or five times, then would either stop part way up, down, or not
move at all.  Same problem as before.
Scratching of heads, all around.  [It's a learning curve, we are ALL on it.]
I take the car anyway, figuring to bring it back when I can leave it for a
day.

Last night, stopping for poker, I couldn't get it to go up (!)  I did a lot
of combinations (engine on/off, tug on parking brake, switch ignition on then
gently depress up button, patted head three times, swore) then it finally
went up -with two or three hesitations, but up none-the-less.
'Okay fine, be that way, you go in the shop tomorrow!'
I get out and push the keyless remote button to lock and arm the car.  The
lights flash twice, as per norm, but then the alarm horn gives me a short
beep- indicating a fault in the circuit, a door is open, a window is open, or
the top is down....  hey, wait a minute, the damn top is up (finally), why do
I get the fault???
I do the stupid thing, get back in the car and put the top down.  It
hesitates a few times in the cycle, as per usual.
I then stick my finger in the opening where the latch is, where a switch
resides, and juke it a few times.
The top then goes up and down like greased snot.
It's that damn switch hanging up!!

This little gem might save follicles, for those challenged or not.

Porsche Boxster Tech Information #9701 4407 4  [quoted without permission]
"Use of aftermarket wheels or wheel accessories (spacers etc.) or non-OEM
wheel bolts on Boxster vehicles is not approved."
"Only the standard wheel bolts can be used to securely mount the wheels to
the vehicle.  Boxster wheel bolts with rotating spherical collars are a
special design and made form a correspondingly selected alloy for
compatibility with standard wheels."
"Endurance tests have shown that conventional, commercially available non-OEM
bolts can loosen when the car is driven, even if they were installed and
tightened to the specified torque."
"Eighteen inch wheels are not approved for use on Boxsters.  Use of eighteen
inch wheels on Boxsters under severe conditions may result in structural
failures of the body and/or suspension."
