I had a long talk with a Porsche engineer in Reno - here's the scoop on
aftermarket wheels... 

Forget it.

The reason: the wheel bolts have a patented  rotating spherical collar that
will not fit non-Porsche Boxster wheels.  Speedline, Tech Art, Gemballa  all
claim to have  wheels for the Boxster ... but in truth, I'm told, none of
these have been specifically designed to accept these unique bolts.   They
may seem to fit, but  over time could loosen.  Very risky.  Very expensive.

The aftermarket people will tell you that this info  is BS - just a marketing
ploy to make us buy Porsche wheels only.  After researching the subject, I
don't think so.   Over time Porsche should be offering wheel options
themselves.  Or maybe the aftermarket people will eventually offer wheels
that are truly designed for the unique Boxster collars and state so in
writing.

As to modified muflers... increasing  backpressure may throw the on board
computer and may effect the engine.  Porsche will offer it's own sound
package in the near future.
