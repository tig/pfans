<< One of
 my business associates has also ordered a Boxster but has since been told by
 a local independent dealer that there is no "real" shortage of these
vehicles
 in our area (Virginia),  but instead that dealers are deliberately limiting
 the delivery if cars in order to incrrease the price and demand.  The dealer
 has the  car on hand which seems to back up his claim.  I wonder if there is
 any other information available to confirm or refute this possibility?
         Thanks,  Jcksnb.

Sales and customer deliveries across the product line are one of the "points"
affecting dealer allocations.  A dealer holding deliveries would receive
reduced allocations and PCNA has also informed them against the practice of
artificial price escalation which could further affect future allocations.
 So, I'd subscribe the allegation noted to "myth" or just poor business
practice of the local dealer.

As to availability, Porsche has increased production capacity by outsourcing
to a supplemental production facility (Valmet Automotive, Inc) in Finland
with delivery capability of 5000 cars per year starting in the autumn of
1997.  Porsche further announced it's investigating estabilishing a
production facility in the United States, it's largest export market.

Any "limited availability" of Boxsters is likely to be as short-term as is
paying in excess of MSRP...
