I was fortunate enough to drive the Boxster at the Scottsdale Arizona 
launch in September, 1996.  After spending a couple of hours in both a 
5-speed and a Tiptronic S, I became a Tiptronic convert.  During the 
Boxster preview, we got the chance to meet with an engineer to discuss 
the Tiptronic S transmission.  He let me in on a few secrets that really 
helped me use the Tiptronic to it's fullest.

First - The transmission selects the shift program based entirely upon 
the way the accelerator is used.  If you make nice gentle starts, it will 
use a program designed for fuel economy and shift into the highest gear 
possible as quickly as it can.  If you jump on the accelerator quickly, 
it will shift to a lower gear depending on how quickly you depress the 
pedal. The transmission has a total of 5 different shift programs 
available (one is the manual mode you enter by putting the shift lever in 
the manual position and using the buttons on the wheel).  

The most interesting mode to me, (and the one we drove in most of the 
time) is the "Race Track" shift program. To enter this mode, you must 
fully depress and release the accelerator several times in a few seconds 
(I seem to remember 2 or 3 blips in 10 seconds).  I don't believe the car 
has to be moving, so you can do it while sitting at a traffic light.  
Once in "Race Track" mode, the transmission will only shift up at red 
line, and will automatically downshift as required -- but it will always 
try to maintain the lowest gear possible.  Gee -- this is exactly how I 
drive a manual transmission at the track, and in practice it feels very 
much like a well-shifted manual transmission!

Now I've also read some negative comments (by David Coleman, in 
Excellance Magazine) about the manual mode and the steering-wheel 
buttons.  It seems Mr. Coleman didn't like the fact that the Tiptronic 
didn't remember his how many times he pressed the shift-down button 
entering a corner.  As I remember, it doesn't actually respond to the 
button press, but just checks to see if the button is pressed.  This 
means that to downshift to the lowest gear for a particular corner, you 
just hold the button down while braking, and when you release it you'll 
be in the lowest possible gear (this is what automatic "Race Track" mode 
will do for you!)  I believe his complaints were just a result of not 
understanding how the transmission was supposed to work.

Anyway, I had a blast driving the car with both manual buttons and in 
pure auto mode.  I suspect that it will take a while as we all discover 
the tricks of getting the most out of our Tiptronics.  Car magazines do 
not always know everything about the cars -- keep the faith.
