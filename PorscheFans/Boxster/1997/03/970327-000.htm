I have been reading with much interest the chat regarding this great car.  Seems
there are those who are not convinced of its heritage.  Must not have driven the
car.  Once that is done, it is clear that it is a thoroughbred.  Evolutionary.  

Remember, all 993 drivers, the Boxster engine architecture, water cooled flat
six is the basis for the new 993.  The front and rear light assemblies seen on
the Boxster are destined for that car as well.

Rumor has it that the wizard who brought the first aftermarket chips is busy at
work on one for the Boxster.  Based on what is known about Porsche engine
development, much is left in this beast to harness.

On to more important things. My local PCA chapter, is thinking, leaning to not
allowing the Boxster on the track for driver's ed due to the height of the roll
bar.  I have seen e-mail from those of you who have tracked the car at Robeling
Road and possibly other tracks.  What did your PCA group say?  Did they have
direction from PCA national?  Any information would be helpful.

So the sun is out, 75 degrees.  Gotta go.

Silver and Red 986
