While away on a ski trip I left the Boxster at the shop to attend to some
small, niggling things...  well, some weren't so small.

The 'howl' or 'whistle' I was experiencing above 50 mph was found to be a
small adjustment of the front hood.  Air was coming in under the lip.
Noise is now gone (thank goodness!)

The 'chatter' at full lock is because the engine rpm drops below the idle
speed.  This causes the power steering pump to labor.  Suggested correction
is keep engine speed up.  (duh).

Top was adjusted slightly for right skew upon closing.

Speedo was measured to be exact. [So the guy who laid the rally route -herr
rallymeister-  has the inaccurate gauge, not me.  He's got a Mercedes!  -but
meisters are never wrong.]

Interior side vents were replaced with working units.

****
MOST IMPORTANTLY
Getting back into this fine roadster is most rewarding.
After driving an econo box rental in the mountains, but of course.

What a FUN car the Boxster is!  Would have liked it on those Colorado
mountain roads (in the summer without the mud and snow.)
****
Important TIP:
Practice safe door opening.
Pull handle, wait for window to dip those few millimeters, then open door.
Seems the pull-handle-open-door routine might be causing some wear on the
'drain' lip on the roof.
I've heard of a number of cars needing repair at that spot.
****
Still getting serious offers to sell it at a premium.  
I'm liking it so much, I've stopped being tempted.
****
Waiting for the report from NOSUBT2 about his run at Roebling Road last
weekend.
Inquiring minds want to know;  how'd that P38 and trick tire/wheel set up run
out??
