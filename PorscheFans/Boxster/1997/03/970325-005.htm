  OK guys (and gals) here is a little bit of interesting news to digest...

       My (former) dealer here in Denver told me that he has received
  approval from PCNA to charge $5000 over MSRP for anyone entering their
  list after March 31. This, I am told, is PCNA's way of saying "were
  sorry" for diverting allocations away from the US to Europe where the
  margins are larger. Of course since we got on the list in January we
  would not be subject to this "market adjustment". We told him to return
  our $1000 deposit. There is NO WAY that this dealer can deliver to us the
  1997 car we contracted for (though he still will not admit it). What
  started my confrontation of the dealer was what I had read on the
  PorscheFans listserv concerning allocations. Without this ammunition he
  wouldn't have checked into the situation. In fact he called me and stated
  "well, what you have been reading on the internet about allocations is
  correct..."(duh) ).
        We were over there yesterday and a sales manager tried to sell us
  their red base demo car (with appropriately torn-up driver's seat) at
  MSRP. "Let us keep your deposit a few more weeks and you can PROBABLY buy
  this car right here". "We'll go down the list and I will try and persuade
  the people above you not to buy the car...". When I inquired about the
  luxury tax I was told that since the car had never been registered I
  would have to pay it. He also told me that they wouldn't fix the seat nor
  reduce the price at all. Gee, what a priviledge it is to buy a Boxster
  from this dealer. So there again we're being jerked around.
       I swear, anyone who defends dealers in this forum should wake up and
  remove their heads from under the sand.
       We're off the list (just as well). We're NOT getting a Boxster (just
  as well). And we're taking our $40,000+ and playing elsewhere (like
  investing or touring the world). When the Boxster is a good used car buy,
  maybe we'll look at it again.

  See ya!
