<<Had a problem with the top yesterday, top retracted but warning light
never went out>>

This and other comments about the Boxster top prompt me to post this message.
FIRST, don't be like the owner who let his teenager take the car for a parade
lap at a sporting event, attractive queen waving to the crowds from her perch
between the seats, and ON TOP of the top and its' cover.
I hear the car is still in the shop, top still nonfunctional!
My top started to go 'intermittent' when being put down.  It would go up like
a champ, even with its' slight rightward skew.  Going down it would stop
midway, almost all the way down, or in between somewhere.  It may be caused
by the button itself.  I checked fuses, of course, but it was more like a
current problem than a complete failure.  There has been trouble in the past
with the 993  cabrio switches (not common, but failures none-the-less).
It happened three times in one day, then twice the next.  Drove to the
dealership, and, you guessed it of course, it worked just fine!  [And that
was the first time I got to see the top cycle from outside the car.  Neat!]
To reproduce the sequence prior to the problem I seem to remember my reaching
over with the other hand [just after starting the top on its' way] to flick
the windows down (one touch), or turning off the air conditioner, the top
would stop.  Then, not touching anything else (you idiot) it would take five
to ten minutes to get the thing to finish the cycle with trying and retrying
the button.
Maybe it's part of the protection circuitry?  Which brings up the warning
light on the dash;  the various motors, detents, sensors, and switches
involved in the top cycle use that light to display faults.  I hear it is
possible the light will go off even while the car is being driven!  
Saw another Boxster in the shop with the driver side outer trim piece (dare
it be called a rain gutter?) pulled off.
I venture it's pulling the door open in one fell swoop that may cause the
damage.  As you know the window dips a few millimeters as you pull the handle
out, clearing the trim piece.  If you yank the door open like on the Ford, it
tugs on the trim.
Like I said once before, practice good door opening- pull handle part way,
window dips, pull handle all the way, open door and jump on in.

Further:
1.)  Anyone out there see their oil level gauge come on while driving the
car?
Inexplicably, cruising on the highway, it displays!  Weird.
