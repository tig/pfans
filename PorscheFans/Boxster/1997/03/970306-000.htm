To William and  others on the Boxster list:

I'll try to keep all up to date on my Boxster happenings also.
I have 1300 mi. and no significant problems. no oil added.
However I did have to add water ( a few oz. ) as did several others
on the list. So far tha level hasn't dropped since, therefore the
reason water was needed isn't clear...leak, air bubble, ???

My dealer says that the rear window is made to be " easily
replacable " however looking at it it should take some
sewing.

You can see pictures of my Boxster, hear the engine and horn
on my new homepage

For those of you who have to drool in anticipation, now
you can do it in multimedia. If you're waiting for a Boxster
rest assured it is " all that and more "

Enjoy

Bill
