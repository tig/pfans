Dave,

Perci just has a different "view" than you do. That does not necessarily
make it narrow.

The bottomline is that the only things you have in common with the Boxter
group is that your car and the Boxter are new. It is these new car
questions that create the bond you desire to make more concrete. 

The 993 has a hell of lot more in common with the 964 than with the
Boxter. The engine is pretty damn near the same. The front suspension is
similar. The transmissions are similar. Many of the parts are the same.

The 993 and the Boxter have very little in common. The engine is way
different. The front and rear suspensions aren't even close. The chassis
layout is not the same. Nor are the handling characteristics. The price of
the vehicles is different and so is the intended market. 

It looks like Perci is right. You want a "newcars" list. Well, ask the
listmeister for that. But don't try and separate the 993 from the 911 list
just because your needs are not being met on the 911 list and some of them
are on the Boxter list. It would appear that your view is the narrow one.

Can we let this thread die now? Please....

I subscribe to all (I think) of the lists in digest, but only the Boxster list in detail because I want to hear what other BOXSTER owners are experiencing,and share info with them. With the exception of model years and a few suspension components, what experiences could I share with 993s?  Maybe a Newcar' list would fit your needs better?"

If there were a "NewCar@ProscheFans.com," then yes, that would probably fit many of the 993 owners' needs just great; however, last time I looked, there wasn't.  The Boxster list is as close as it comes, and I share much more in common with Boxsters than I do with owners of  914's, 924's, 944's, 911's and so on.  I guess I have a different view--had you told me you wanted to participate in a 993 list, I'd have said "great, new view point, and who knows what the possibilities could be."
