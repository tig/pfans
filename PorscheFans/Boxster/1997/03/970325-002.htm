Before taking anything that the UK magazine Performance Car has to say
too seriously, bear in mind the peculiar mindset of British car fans.

As I recall the same article said that no one in their offices was
anxious to own a Boxster.  Clearly, this puts them at odds with much of
the rest of the world.

This is the same country that brought us the XJS as the height of Jaguar
styling and engineering, and then had the temerity to produce the ugly
thing for many years.

The same article also noted several other current British roadster
offerings as superior to the Boxster in many respects.  Dredge the
magazine back up and look at the lines of these cars.  Clearly, there
seems to be an idiosyncratic (perhaps even ethnocentric) outlook at work
here.

However, irrespective of their particular views, it does strike me as
strange as to why one would want to pay a significant quantity of hard
earned for one of the most responsive and direct sports cars in the
world, then add such a complex set of directives from a piece of
equipment that is designed to emulate the effects you get without buying
it.
