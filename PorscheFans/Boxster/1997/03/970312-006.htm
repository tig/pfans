Hi Bob. The story here in the Great White North (it's snowing today :-P ) is similar. The dealer has 
been informed that he will receive an allocation of 2 cars/month for the next 3 months, then that will 
be the end of the 1997 production. He will have received more cars than PCNA promised based 
on last year's sales, but a lot of them have had restrictions (you vill move zees Tiptronics, ya!). 
This puts him in the position of having people with deposits, who may not get cars until the 
fall/winter, even though they put money down before others who already have taken delivery!

FWIW

May97 986/P38 (#6, March production order in, now if I just had a production date...)
