I'm on the waiting list for my Boxster at my local dealership and it is
supposed to come in some time in the August time frame.  I've been
thinking about the options list the dealer gave, specifically the
accessory hardtop.  I plan on keeping my Boxster as long as possible, and
I was thinking that buying the hardtop would help prolong the life of the
soft top.  I've never owned a convertible Porsche, and I was wondering if
storing the top in the down position for the entire winter would destroy
it rather than preserve it, since it'd be folded for a couple of months
and there would be the possiblity that it might mold from moisture. Plus,
I've read some of the comments on this list about creases in the rear
window forming, and the ease/difficulty it can be replaced with.  Does
anyone have a Boxster with the hardtop?  I test drove the dealer's demo
car, and attempted to put the top down, but they told me that Porsche
doesn't recommend operating the top in sub-50 degree conditions since it
might crack the rear window.  So, I'm curious if the hardtop would be
worth the money, or not.
