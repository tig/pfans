My business partner just bought a 993 C2 a couple of months back.  I =
told him about this PorscheFans site.  He subscribes to the 911/993 list =
and is always interested in what is going on in the Boxster list.  We =
were talking and came to the conclusion the newer 993 owners are more =
like Boxster owners than older 911 owners.  He was telling that the bulk =
of the mail on the service he belongs to pertains to working on the car. =
 My partner is much more interested in how to care for the car and what =
kind of accessories are available than how to swap out the engine in a =
930.   I wonder how many 993 owners belong to the Boxster list?
Just turned 700 miles on the Boxster, I enjoy it more every time I drive =
it.  I have the 16" wheels and Bridgestones.  Want to go up to 17".  Any =
recommendations on wheels?  I think I will stay with the Bridgestones, =
the Boxster sticks to the road like a slot car.
