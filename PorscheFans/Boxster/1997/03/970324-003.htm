	Yes. Yes. Yes. While we're on the subject of "real Porsches",
	consider this (especially if there are some of you who think
	the 911 is the *only* real Porsche); Porsches are expensive.
	911 models are, and pretty much always have been, the most
	expensive models. This leads to some owner's of these cars
	looking down on the "other" Porsche models as a fake Porsches
	simply because they're not 911s i.e., they're not as expensive.
	Sad and ugly, but true. Now, there are plenty of people with
	both the funds and the passion to collectivly own a few 917s, some
	962's, a 935 here and there, etc. Would it be fair for them
	to look down on 911 owners as not owning a "real" Porsche?
	Of course not. But that's the same thing those (hopefully rare) 
	911 people are doing when they look at the 986, the 914, the 944,
	and claiming that those are not real Porsches.

	A Porsche is a Porsche if it has the Porsche logo on it and
	it doesn't matter if it came from VW, Audi, Finland, or Mars.
