Visited the dealer today to find out the latest on the 97 allocation
story.  He recently received his 3 month allocation schedule for
boxsters.  Instead of the 27 cars he expected to delivery in the April -
June Qtr, he get's 10.  (This after getting only 3 cars in March rather
than the 5 he expected).  His understanding is that the factory is
working at full speed.  I asked him about the rumour that cars are being
diverted to other markets where the margins are higher, his only
response was "yeah, I've heard that."  

Anyway, it's now clear that my second boxster will be a '98, and may not
be delivered this calender year, so... I had him move my name and
deposit to the "S" list.  I'm number 5 on that list, expect delivery
somewhere in the 12 - 20 month time frame.  Dealer only had second hand
info, but expects 3.0L, 250+hp, upgraded interior, etc, etc.  Will watch
the market for information.

In the meantime, I continue to add miles to the '97 with tiptronic. 
With the tip, rather than a fuel shutoff at the rev limit, it simply
upshifts to the next gear.  William is right, once it gets above 4k RPM,
it becomes a different beast.  I took it to the NC mountains this week,
it handles great, very progressive reaction.  

Continue to get lots of questions about the car.  At the conference I
attended this week, someone came into the session and wanted to know who
had the new white ferrari in the parking lot!  I guess the Porsche hood
and wheel crests are too subtle, and the only boxster the guy knew about
was the boxer!
