James J Dempsey asked about the metal sills on a non silver car.  My car
is white, added the sills yesterday (with install help from W.H.) and
they look great.  Echo comments from others who think this should be
standard stuff.

Following all the comments about the plastic window, I went to the new
911 sales brochure.  Page 45, on the cabriolet, says that the rear
window on that car is bonded, rather than stitched, for "easy and quick
replacment . . . if necessary."  Do not know why they did not follow the
same process on the boxster.  Even with care, after just 1 week it's
clear mine is not going to last for a long time.  I love the way the top
works, but folding that window in the middle seems like madness to me.  

On the topic of Zymol, I found the stuff (creme, for light colored cars)
for $18.00 for 8oz in my local Western Auto store.  All the ads and
catalogs I get show a price of at least double that. The packaging seems
to match the pictures in the catalogs, and contains a bunch of marketing
materals.  I was prepared to order a jar of the expense stuff and see if
I was getting the same wax.  Anybody else seen this stuff in local
stores so cheap?

Is anybody else having trouble getting the digest version of this list?
I only get it about every 4 or 5 days, I've been having to go to the web
site to retrieve the missing issues.  I have confirmed my address on the
list is correct, even tried removing and re-adding my address, that
process went well (got all the confirm messages), but since then have
only received the March 1 and  March 8 digests.

Cheers, RC
