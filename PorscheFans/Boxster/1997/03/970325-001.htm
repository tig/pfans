<<been told by a local independent dealer that there is no "real" shortage of
these vehicles>>

A dealer makes a living by selling cars, not artificially driving the price
of cars up.  To them a month is based simply on units sold, not characters
tempted by vapor inventory.
An independent dealer probably doesn't have the unit in the first place and,
to keep you on the telephone, will say anything.  

Porsche has experienced a delivery problem of units in port, but not enough
trucks to move them to the dealers.  There is no shortage of orders on hand
for the units, purportedly hundreds at some dealers.  By in large authorized
dealers are selling them for MSRP.  No 'sticker plus' haggling, straight
retail.
It'd be a nice thing to know you have a certain volume of business for the
coming months, especially when looking at floor plan interest on the
sluggishly selling 993.  Playing games with price and availability is not in
the picture, I suspect.

I do agree some things are not 'right' about the manner in which the Boxster
was presented to early buyers, but attribute that to PCNA directly.  They
forced a certain "P16" option on the first cars, limited the color selection
(actually made only three available), and limited additional options to a
very few (if you wanted  your car delivered in the first few batches).
This may have been 'start up' nuances we, as users, could not comprehend from
a manufacturing standpoint.

I do know there is a pretty Boxster sitting in my garage, for which I waited
patiently THREE years.  For those that have an eight to ten month wait now,
consider it a luxury.  From what I hear you can order it any way you want, in
any color, with all manner of gizmos and gadgets- even Euro delivery.
I've heard there is a price increase coming, and the build volume will be
supplemented in Finland.  Those are more worrisome than gouging.

A day does not go by without a serious offer from someone who wants my car.
 They are willing to pay, at least, what I have in it.  Some are offering up
to $6K to $10K more, although I've never seen the actual money.
It's the American way.  If I can drive my car for a year and sell it for what
I have in it, great.
