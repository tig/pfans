     Pfans,
     
        As many of you reported earlier on, my convertible to has been 
     missing the grove on the passenger side (misses to the inside).  I 
     recall that eventually, this can lead to a torn rubber strip 
     surrounding the edge wire.  I also recall that one of you had this 
     fixed by the dealer, I have an appointment for the Wed. with the 
     dealer (having the oil changed after 2K mi.).  What was the fix?  
     There is a strap w/ Velcro just inside the area that misses the track, 
     it seems to catch on the wrong part of the bar it surrounds, could 
     this be the source of the problem?
     
        For those of you whose top edges tore, did the dealer repair the 
     tear or replace the top under warranty?
     
     TIA
