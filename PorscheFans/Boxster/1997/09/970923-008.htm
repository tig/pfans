Thanks to several helpful responses, I have collected a bit more
knowledge about Tourist delivery.

Tourist delivery is ordered like any other option at the time the car
itself is ordered.  Apparently there are two types of tourist delivery
-- The Grand Tour and the unwashed tour. =20

Barbara Phelps at PNA in Reno told me about the Grand Tour which is
sponsored by Porche.  In fact, Ms. Phelps is leading such a group this
week and is planning another for next Spring, probably late May to
early June.  Everyone arrives in Germany own their own and meets on
Thursday at a hotel where Porche makes the reservation, but with the
tourist covering his own hotel expense.  There, paperwork for the car
is signed followed by drinks and dinner, courtesy of Porche.  On
=46riday morning early, a bus ride takes the tourists to Zuffenhausen
for a factory tour and lunch with the Porche workers in their company
cafeteria.  This is followed by another bus trip to Weisen (sp?) where
a Porche engineer will take the tourist for a ride on the test track
in a Porche factory car, not your car.  Then, its back to the hotel
for more food and drink.  About 11:00 on Saturday the Boxster is
picked up and you are on your own.  There are two spots to drop off
the Porche for delivery to the U.S.  One is Stuttgart and I do not
recall the other.

Porche charges $1150 U.S. for the Grand Tour and this includes the
insurance on the Boxster for two weeks.  The $1150 is payable to the
dealer just as any other option.  For an additional sum, which Ms.
Phelps describes as nominal for the Boxster, insurance for four weeks
can be arranged by Porche. =20

After my discussion with Ms. Phelps, I called my dealer to discuss
getting on the Spring 98 Grand Tour or maybe the unwashed version.
With the latter, I understand you are on your own all the way,
including arranging for automobile insurance in Europe, not an easy
task as those of you who have tried are aware.  (Marketing
opportunity, Herr Allstate?)  My dealer says that Porche charges $1150
for any Tourist delivery, whether or not one goes on the Grand Tour or
on their own.   Ms. Phelps did not mention the unwashed tour.

My dealer (not Ms. Phelps) also said that I would have to do several
things financial.  The first was to pay or make arrangements for
payment of the car in full to the dealer no less than 30 days in
advance of the Grand Tour.  This is the case regardless of how you
intend to satisfy the MSRP invoice.   Thjis point was interesting.  I
received an e-mail from a French citizen living in the U.S. that was
leaving from the US this week to pick up his Boxster.  He was under
the impression that because he was not a US citizen, he was required
to pay in advance.  According to my dealer, this policy is applicable
to everyone.

The second condition was a shocker.  My dealer also said that PNA will
require me to post a refundable deposit of $10,000 in escrow with PNA
30 days before the Grand Tour, explaining that the Boxster sells for
more money in Europe than in the USA.  The dealer says some Americans
were trekking to Zuffenhausen, picking up their Boxster and
immediately selling the Boxster on the European market.  This, says
she,  apparently caused the European dealers to flame the Tourist
Delivery program, prompting Porche to insist on the refundable escrow
deposit which, she continues, bears interest at US prime.   Continues
the dealer, when the car arrives in the U.S. port, PNA refunds the
$10K with interest earned. =20

This latter point was really puzzling.  Two people that had
participated in the Tourist program wrote me about their experience.
Neither mentioned having to post a refundable $10K cash escrow deposit
with PNA.  Neither did Ms. Phelps with PNA. =20

=46inally, someone wrote that if you have 5000 or more miles on the
Boxster when it enters the US, then there is some sort of price break
in the tax scheme somewhere.  I asked the dealer about this and she
said this used to be true because the car with 5000 miles could be
treated as a demo which received more favorable tax treatment.  Now,
she says, this is no longer true and all cars pay the same tax.
(Sorry lady but I somehow doubt that a 1967 Citroen pays the same tax
at Port of Houston as the new Boxster.)

Bottom line:  It seems to me that a company doing business on at least
two continents would publish something  about their program so dealers
and consumers alike could readily know what is and is not required. =20

While there used to be a price break for Tourist delivery, that is no
longer true.  Tourist delivery cars come out of the dealer allocation
and Ms. Phelps says you must bargain with your dealer.
