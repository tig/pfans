I have been enquiring of others about their speedo problems, if any.  As
suggested, it is hard to get a reading if both speedo and odo are off.  
Intererstingly, they are not off the same percentage.  Is there a consensus
on this list regarding speedo error.  If it is just my car and a few
others, then that is one type of issue, if it is most of the cars with 17's
then maybe we can get PGA to listen to a group.  Advice will be
appreciated.  As noted previously the car is getting its new engine and
this strikes me as the time to deal with this issue.

Thanks for any help
