Thanks to all who took the time to give me their insight into the
value of Porche Techequipment.  I agree that the company is mighty
proud of their options.  Too proud in my humble opinion but if I want
those damned heated seats and headlight washers, I will just have to
pay, I guess.

  I did find it interesting that so many asked whether resale value
was a consideration in my decision to buy a Boxster.  To this
greatgrandson of Scotland, the question answers itself.  It has been
part and parcel of almost every decision I have ever made, especially
when buying something that I know going in is a depreciating asset
being purchased with discretionary funds.  Fifty K invested in the
Vanguard 500 Index fund would be a lot better financial investment but
would not return nearly as much in the quality of life index.

=46rom my perspective, (and in this forum it may be heresy) I am a
little taken back that someone would buy one of these wonderful
machines and then put it at risk on a race track where, I suspect,
Allstate et al have built many policy exclusions into their collison
coverage.  I liken that to putting $50K down on a crap table.  But
then, I am not an experienced race driver with a bullet proof
mentality.  I am not criticizing those that do race their cars; they
obviously find the risk worth the enjoyment.  I just can't afford the
risk.
