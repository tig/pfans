I'm a happy tiptronic owner.  I test drove both and wanted the 5-speed, but
ended up buying a nearly-new Boxster that just happened to have a tip.  To be
honest, I had some regrets for about the first week, but now I absolutely
love it.  It is a blast to drive - by no means is it just an "automatic". 
You really do get to run through the gears just like any 5 speed.

In my opinion, the tip can shift faster than most humans can shift the
manual, and it also keeps power to the wheels through the shift.  On the
other hand, the 5 speed yields a faster 0-60 time.  I think this is caused by
two things - slightly different gearing and the fact that the tip
automatically shifts as soon as you hit red line, whereas a manual driver
could push the engine a tiny bit further.  The tip also automatically
downshifts when you hit around 800 RPM.

I love my tip, but wouldn't try to talk someone out of the manual.  It
depends a lot on where and how you plan to drive it.  I had this vision on
being on country roads all the time, but in reality I find myself in traffic
quite a bit.  As for those winding coastal roads, I don't feel like I have
sacrificed anything.  The tip is very exhilarating as well - Both hands tight
on the wheel, tap or double tap down into a good curve, and tap back up
coming out of the turn and into the straight.
