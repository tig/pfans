Just this last Saturday, I took my new silver/green Boxster on the Southern
California Dream Drive, from San Diego to Laguna Beach and back on Pacific
Coast Highway all the way (except for that stretch on I-5 through Camp
Pendleton).  The sun was going down in the Pacific as I pulled into the San
Clemente scenic point on the way back. It really can't get much better than
that.

Anyway, I noticed when switching among radio stations and CDs that there
are certain songs that really sound great in a Boxster cruising along with
the top down at a speed that's just a teensy bit illegal.  Since I have
access to a CD press that can make audio CDs, I was thinking of collecting
the best choices - in fact I was thinking of making two - one for the
top-down high speed daylight runs, and another for the late night tuxedo
cruise with the top up and a gorgeous woman in the passenger seat.

Here's some of what I chose - no doubt they reflect my musical tastes,
although I must say that I haven't listened to these in a while.  Anyone
else have any candidates?

CD1 - Boxster by Day:

1) "Barracuda" Heart
2) "Who Are You" Who
3) "The Brazilian" Genesis
4) "Live and Let Die" Wings
5) "Danger Zone" Kenny Loggins
6) "To Live and Die in L.A." Wang Chung

CD2 - Boxster by Night:

1) "Aldeberan" Enya
2) "Love Theme from Bladerunner" Vangelis
3) "Memories of Green" Vangelis
4) "In the Air Tonight" Phil Collins
5) "Holding on to Yesterday" Ambrosia
6) "Requiem" Bestor/Cardon
