Steve,

You know the old joke, if it hurts when you do that, don't do that.
Seriously, my old 911 buddies claim they can spot the new Porsche owners
because they are the ones who think the crest is there to keep
finger/palm prints off the paint when they  close the hood.  The
old-timers suggest two palms, one to either  side of the crest to
execute the final latching pressure.  Stay off the crest.  The paint
crack is a new one on me, usually the symptoms are a broken crest.

Cheers, RC
