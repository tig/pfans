Chris,

The picture in the promo book shows a European version -> at least for
the '97 model the console was an option in Europe.  If you take a closer
look under the console, you'll find a number of electronic boxes and
wiring connectors for such things as the airbags.  To duplicate the
European look, you'd need to relocate all of that stuff, not just
stretch a piece of red carpet across the tunnel.  (Unless of course you
like the bumpy look.)  

Perhaps the designers of our much beloved boomerang could build a
stainless steel plate that would fit over all the electronic boxes and
such when you removed the console.  That console is not really very
sturdy, my guess is an object hitting it at high speed would destroy it
and cause significant damage to the electronics stored underneath.  A
stainless steel plate would provide much better protection.  Let's face
it, a broken arm or leg will heal with time, but do you have any idea
how much money Porsche wants for some of those electronic boxes?  OUCH,
now that's pain!

Cheers, RC
