Jim wrote regarding the acceptability of the sports suspension for a 50
mile commute.

Jim I have had a sports suspension equipped Boxster since March and found
it to be very comfortable and easy to live with both commuting and in the
country. I use it in Australia where the roads aren't quite as good as
yours, but have found the suspension miles more comfortable than my 86
944Turbo (in back to back comparisons) and decades in front of my 76
Carrera.  It's not quite as comfy as my 75 Caddilac Eldorado though!

I have driven both sport and non sport equipped, and while I beleive the
car handles fantastically as either, it's a bit crisper with the sport and
you don't lose too much in the ride. Be a devil Jim, order the sport
suspension, you will love it on Sundays.
