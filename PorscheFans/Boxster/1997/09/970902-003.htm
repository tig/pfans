Steve,

I've only operated the spoiler manually a couple of times, (to clean
around it), no problems to date.  As for radar detectors, I've used the
Valentine 1 for years.  It's expensive and ugly, but it tells you how
many radar signals it's tracking and their relative location, a very
helpful feature.  Once you get to know a route, seeing an extra signal
show up keeps you from running past a radar trap at speed because you
thought he signal was just the usual noise.   

I changed the oil around 5,000 miles.  Wanted to make sure any nasty
bits from the break in phase get flushed out.  I'll likely continue to
change the oil often, I keep the revs high (you have to in this car) and
oil and filter changes on a regular basis can't do any harm.  

Cheers, RC
