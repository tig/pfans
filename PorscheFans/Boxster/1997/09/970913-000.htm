Harry:
I own a May delivery Arctic Silver 986 with black leather interior.  I
looked into several extened warranties: Warranty Gold; Automotive
Preferred Care Q2 (CNA) and the General Electric warranty. I purchased
my car from one dealer and live 70 miles away. Our local dealer will
only accept the insurance they sell which is GE. Otherwise, they said I
am on my own meaning I will pay them in cash and have to apply for
reimbursement from the insurance carrier. Living with the HMO system and
health care collection headaches, I opted to pay $1,987 plus sales tax
for a "bumper to bumper", $50 deductible, 72 month or 60,000 mile
contract.  I NEVER purchased insurance on car repairs before believing
the odds of the house are against you. Porsche does not offer direct
insurance and GE is in business to make money. I guess I felt that a
brand new car with extensive electronics needed special consideration. I
have NO ability to repair the 986 and need to rely on others. With the
expense experience of owning Audis and Peugeots I opted for the GE
policy. There are cheaper policies but it depends how much tenacity you
have to pursue reimbursements. Supposedly, the GE policy comes with a
"plasic card" that can travel with you.  Fortunately or unfortunately I
haven't had to use it yet so the "house" continues to win.
