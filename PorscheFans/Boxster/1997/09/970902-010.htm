I just picked up my 986 (Artic Silver/ Boxster Red like the pictures. Main
Options P63 Sports Package, Computer) last week from Heishman's in Arlington,
Va.  Had on order for over 2 years.  This is my 13th Porsche and I hope it's
not unlucky.  So far is is the most fun Porsche to drive even thought it
doesn't have the power of my last Porsche (91 C4) or the 914-6.  I've read
last months messages and would like to pass on my 2cs.  
	(1) My Salesman, Chick Stanton from Heishman's handles this sale in the same
professional manner as he has in the past.  Today I even got a tin of cookies
with a thank you note.  I don't see any "take the customer for granted"
attitude here as some of you found at other dealerships.  
	(2)  I removed the air bag sticker with finger nail polish remover.  It came
off very quickly.  I removed the sunvisors from the car and did the work in
the house, but I just happened to have the right goofy sockets from my
computer toolbox.
	 (3)  I have 17" wheels with Michelins
	(4)  My speedo error is 10% and I'm very upset about it because everything
else is perfect, just ask Manuell.  Does anyone know of a fix?
	(5)  My 986 shifts quick & smooth and it's better than my C4.  Maybe this is
a car specific issue.  Throw is long, I grant you, but still quick.
	(6)  I didn't get the Sports Touring Package because I don't like the silver
guages, etc. but I miss a CD changer.  I got the CD radio which is a Becker.
 Does anyone recommend an after market CD changer that will snap into the
clips in front or should I just get the Becker changer from Porsche?
	(7) I plan to hook up the second rear fog light if it's just a plug in in
the rear trunk.  I'll let you know how that goes later.
	(8)  I drove over 1,000 miles last week with my wife in the 986.  We had
room for all our clothes, tent, sleeping bags, thermarests, pillows, cameras,
etc.  It was very comfortable and we drove with the top down or up without
having to get out to store the roof or sun roof.  A great car for 2  (or 1)
people! !  No back broblems or discomfort althought I agree that the center
console does intrude into my right leg space but I'll get used to it.  I am
6'2" and 220#s. 
	(9)  The Boxster Red interior ($2,324) seems more expensive than Optional
Leather($1,951), but it includes leather dash top & bottom, top of
instruments, center console, roll bar  and door panels which look like they
should be covered.  I saw one at my dealers with everthing leather and it
looked like too much and was very expensive.
