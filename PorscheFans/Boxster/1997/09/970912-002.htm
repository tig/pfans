Jiffy Lube sucks:

Of course the Porsche dealer is always going to charge more for
changing oil than the Jiffy Lube place.  On the other hand, I would
never take my Boxster (or my Volkswagen) to Jiffy Lube -- too many
horror stories about leaving the oil cover off or the nut loose.

Lots of oil:

One thing people need to realize is that most cars take between 4 and
5 quarts of oil while the Boxster takes something like 8 or 9.  (I
don't have the manual in front of me.)  9 quarts of Mobil 1 at $4 each
is just about the $40 John spends for the entire oil change on his
Volvo and that doesn't even include the price of the filter or labor.
$100 is a lot of money (to me) and it may well behoove you to learn to
do it yourself in the interest of saving money, but with $40 for oil
and (say) $20 for a filter, $100 doesn't sound to me like the dealer
is screwing anyone.  

Rich people:

$160 is another matter.  That's highway robbery.  Of course, there are
people (maybe on this list) to whom this distinction means little.
They are probably the same people who buy the top-of-the-line Zymol
wax I saw in their catalog this week at $1500 for 12oz.
