Been following the list religiously and sorry to hear that some of you
folks are having some problems.  We just got back to NYC from a weekend
trip to Cape Cod and rolled over 4300 miles.  Great fun and still
nothing to complain about.  Looking forward to getting te car into the
dealership though for a quick oil change (1st one) and a once over to
check for problems.

Have collected the MPG data for the last 1000 miles and will post
resluts when I remember to bring my notes inside.  As noted by others
the car gets a LOT of stares and comments.  My biggest concern is side
by side parking in lots.  I dread the day I will return to find a BIG
chip of paint missing from the middle of on of the doors.  Knock on
wood.  While on the Cape I saw only one other 986.  It was navy with
grey interior, sports package, aluminum brake handle and shift knob
(VERY cool) and a sticker on the wind stop that read "Brooklyn Law
School"  If the owner subscribes - let me know :-).  

I ordered the color catalogue from Automotion in CA and was disappointed
to find very little in terms of accessories for the Boxster - I guess it
is still too early.  I think I will order a set of "floor mats" for the
two trunks in order to keep the material looking like new.  Also, I am
toying with the idea of installing the aluminum gauges and the shift and
brake handle.  They latter two looked great in the car I saw at the
Cape.  I think it will look especially cool on my car since it is silver
with black interior (some aluminum/silver in the interior to match the
exterior) and break up the existing set up which is ALL black.  
Now some questions for the gang:
Any thoughts on the add-ins; good idea or keep it simple?
What are the choices for sourcing these items (ie. porsche or third
party)?
Where would I get the best value on these components?
Can I install them myself?
Is the shifter knob (the one I saw was more rounded than the basic 986
knob, which is sort of shaped like a mushroom) similar, or identical to
the one in the 993s?
One final thought... The other option I am considering is the hard top -
Northeastern winter around the corner... If you had to two choices 1)
gagues, shifter and brake handel or 2) hard top   what to do?

Happy motoring...

PS I bought the Valentine One based on the advice I recieved on the list
and am happy to report no tickets since then.  Thanks to all who
responded on that one!
