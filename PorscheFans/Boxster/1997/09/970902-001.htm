Had occasion to push the button to raise the spoiler yesterday, it sure
went up, but the button sure went in....All the way through the side of
the car. I could just touch it with my little finger, then the switch
seemed to drop down even further, and boy, am I going to love spending
an hour + of my time going to the dealer to get the darn thing fished
out.  Just a warning for others...be careful!  

Put the top up yesterday for the first time. Got a loud clang at about
half staff, but couldn't see anything gone wrong. Continued to the end
of the cycle, and all was OK (I hope). Fished around on both sides in
the inards behind the seats and found are two elastic thingies sewn on a
sort of shroud that have a clasp at the end.  Anyone know how to
refasten these, and what their purpose are?  Not sure what that noise
was, but it could have been these clasps coming off their fastening
points.

Thanks to Glen concerning the lit displays. I was wondering also...

Noticed Bernadines' comment that the oil was going to be changed after
some 4500 miles.  I am wondering why? All boxsters come with Mobil 1,
synthetic, and should be good for a longer period.  Is there a good
reason for changing oil so early.  I'd love to see some discussion on
this subject.  I change my Dino oil (not synthetic) every six months, or
about every 400 miles, but that's an old car, and not driven much.  What
about the Boxster guys and girls?

Anybody got good ideas for a radar detector, what works best etc.? I'm
in South Carolina.

Yep, haven't sold mine, so I am getting ready to drive. Got 140 miles
now!

Steve
