     As the owner of a roof rack, I thought I'd add that whilst you can 
     have it on with roof up or down, you can't raise or lower the roof 
     with it actually on.
     
     Mine came a couple of weeks after the car did in a large cardboard 
     box. Including aluminium parts and a selection of nuts and bolts. 
     Conveniently the instructions were only in German (not even Japanese). 
     Even more conveniently those instructions only describe how to fit the 
     completed roof rack to the car, not how to build the thing.
     
     However, it was actually quite easy to assemble and it is beautifully 
     constructed - but it should be its not exactly cheap!
     
     I haven't had cause to use it yet, I ordered it since I intend to take 
     the car up to the Japan Alps to go skiing this winter. (Rude not to 
     since the Olympics are here this winter). The brochure showed skis and 
     surf boards on the rack so I'm assuming my friendly Porsche dealer 
     will be able to supply suitable attachments - no doubt at significant 
     extra cost :).
     
     The Porsche dealer I used in Tokyo was actually very helpful, but they 
     have made a significant effort to tempt me into ordering a new 996 
     type 911 (can you blame them for trying!?). Having read the reviews in 
     Autocar recently I must admit I mighty tempted. Official orders in 
     Japan start on 1st October for Summer 98 delivery. Main pity is its 
     50% more than the Boxster, and for that money I could buy a year old 
     F355 here.
     
     Anyone considering shelling out all the extra cash for a 996?
     
     Dan.
