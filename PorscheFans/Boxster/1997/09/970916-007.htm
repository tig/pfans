I was an instructor at the drivers school to which you are referring.  I didn't see the incident but I can give you a partial explanation, which
is important for all Boxster owners to understand.
 
Cars handle differently depending on the engine/transmission/drive wheel
configuration, and these handling differences are fairly predictable.
Front engine front wheel drive cars tend to understeer under almost
all conditions including changing throttle position.
Front engine rear wheel drive cars tend to understeer but can be 
induced to rotate (oversteer) some much more easily than others, depending
on driver inputs including steering, throttle lift, and trail braking.
Porsche 944 series cars are front engine, rear transaxle cars which have
a high polar moment of intertia, and tend to be quite stable and difficult
to spin.
All rear engine cars have rear transaxles and either rear wheel drive
or four wheel drive.  911's come in both varieties.  The typical 911
tends toward oversteer because of the long distance between the steering
axis (front axle) and center of gravity (near the back).  Any small
input of steering is magnified by the "pendulum" effect of the mass
of engine and transmission at the back of the car.  Therefore it is
very easy to get the rear of the car sliding sideways (oversteer)
but it also tends to be rather controllable and in fact is the
preferred driving style for the quickest lap times at the track.
You will confirm this by noting the different lines that 911 drivers
run compared to other types of cars, and by riding with an experienced
911 pilot.
 
Now, the Boxster.  Like the 914, it has a mid-engine and rear 
transaxle.  It therefore has a low polar moment of inertia, mid-car
center of gravity, and the steering center and weight centers of
the car are fairly close.  This combination of engineering features
produces a car that feels very responsive and rotates easily.  
However, once the car starts rotating excessively (spinning), it
may do so too quickly for the driver to catch.  This produces the
"spinning top" phenomenon that you noticed on the Boxster.
As for it not having any potential as a race car, don't bet on it.
Take a look at the 911 GT1 - same drivetrain layout as the Boxster.
 
Hope this clarifies your observations.  Enjoy your car!
