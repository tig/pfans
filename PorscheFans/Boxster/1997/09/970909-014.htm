TC doesnt hurt in the fall and winter months that is if you intend to drive it
then...
as for Full Leather... go for it you owe it to yourself to bathe yourself in
leather its quite
overwealming when you first sit in all that leather it blows your mind...

if you are riding the fence whether to get it now or later as I was... be
warned to what
most dealers will say is possible... but after I got my car I had to call PCNA
and they told me "NO" it isn't planned as an aftermarket product.

I was thouroughly pissed... hopefully the situation will change later.

I have Carbon fiber accents in my car... my steering wheel is carbon fiber w/
leather (boxster red) and it looks even better than the catalogue picture it
has to be seen to be apreciated...
http://www.scottsdalejag.com/box/bxcwheel.jpg

also I ordered the carbon fiber shifters for my tiptronic baby... but they are
currently conflicting... my car came w/ the leather/aluminum shifter/brake from
my Sports Touring pkg. the shifter will definitely go in favor of the carbon
beauty but the handbrake I'm gonna leave and leave my self the option of
playing w/ the carbon one later as ill be keeping the parts...

also the carbon strip that is in the picture is only available to my knowledge
w/ the two-toned dash... its a great look when you hook it up right... here's
an url or 3 of 2-toned dashes that will make you wanna look into interior
options...

this is the most striking... I would get this If I hadn't fallen in love w/
Boxster Red.

Oh, the big regret in my Boxster-buying experience is that I was not informed
of Tourist Delivery which I found out about after I got my car... this is a
different way of getting your car delivered... instead of getting it at your
dealer... you go to Stuttgart and pick it up... 
the whole trip... airfare, hotels, the delivery itself could run about
2500-3000 but I think it would be worth it... do look into it... I wish I knew
about it I would have went...
