Finally!

I picked up my Boxster last night.  It's been about 4 since I put a
deposit down in a couple of dealers for a cancel, not a specific order.
After a few unsuccesful deals(wrong color, wrong options, lying
salespeople, delays...) I finally picked up the car available at Ira in
Danvers.

Silver/Red, 5-speed, hard-top, Sport Touring Package, heated seats, and a
few other interior touches(alum/leather etc...)
It was a little pricey($55,329) but I couldn't go through more
delays/unsuccesful deals.  Plus the dealer gave me what I thought was a
good deal for my trade in(Volvo 850Turbo) and gave me a free hardtop
carriage/holder and car cover.  

Car is beautiful!  What can I say.  Everyone of you know already.

Haven't driven too much but I can already tell that the car is probably
the best handling car I have driven.
Haven't been able to fully test the engine out because of the break-in and
the fact that my license situation doesn't permit me to do so....

One major point;

The car thad the hardtop on, and it seemed like it made a lot wind noise
from right around the edges of the roll bar.  Like too much wind was
slipping in through...  could it be that the hardtop was not
sealed/installed properly and there was a leak??  Or is this normal with
hartops?
This was happening from both sides, passenger and driver...
Any ideas?

Alberto.
