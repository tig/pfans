First a little background information. Finland is a country in scandinavi=
a between Sweden and Russia. In here lives 5 million finns and 5 billion =
trees. There is one car plant in the country. It's located in Uusikaupunk=
i at the shore of gulf of Bothnia and called Valmet Automotive. In the =
past they have made several models of Saabs, Talbots and Opel Calibra. =
Saab is likely familiar name. Talbot was french manufacturer once owned =
by Chrysler. Opel is GMs European badge and Calibra it's "sport" coupe =
ala Ford Probe. Plants current products are Saab 900 cabriolet and Samara=
.. More or less every 900 cab has been made in that plant. Samara is russi=
an FWD sedan that was partly designed by Porsche. From now on there will =
be third car in production.

Now what all that has got to do with Porsche? To the horror of many of =
you I'm sure, that third car is Boxster. Apparently Porsche searched for =
more capasity and lower costs. Production has aready started and first =
car goes to Porsche GEO. Yearly production plan is more than 5000 cars. =
Most of these will go to US. Quality of these cars should be equal to one=
s made in Germany. More supply will probably lower resale value of used =
ones. How all this will affect status of Porsche remains to be seen. More=
