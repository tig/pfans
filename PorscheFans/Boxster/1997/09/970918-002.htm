PFans,

        Sorry about the repost, but this message was inadvertently
attached to another, and I wanted to post it with the correct subject.

        I just received my Becker Silverstone 2660 6CD changer directly
from Becker (Saddlebrook NJ) for $400 (half dealer cost)-- this is the
identical unit that Porsche puts in the Boxster (different label).
Well-- one difference is the mount, (the Porsche mount for $25 does not
require drilling in the trunk, the Becker mount, that comes with the unit
requires drilling).

        To install the unit, you will need the radio removal keys from
Becker (and you will have to reenter the radio code after reinstalling
the radio).  I tried the CD changer (not fully installed yet) and it
works fine.

        PROBLEM -- I don't know how to route the cable from the radio to
the trunk.  I called PCNA for help, and they just called my dealer's
service department (of the $140 oil change) who gave me a call and said
they would be back to me, that was four days ago, I'm not holding my
breath.  Sooooo -- has anyone out there done this installation?  If so,
how?  [Preferably without any drilling].  TIA.
