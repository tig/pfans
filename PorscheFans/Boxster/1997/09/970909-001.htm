Adam, I fully agree with your comments!
I was really surprised to see that they tested the Boxster without the
Sport Package. They actually say in the article that the results would
have been different if the Boxster had the Sport Package option! 

Anyway, that article didn't change my mind on the Boxster. I've driven
it in France and I still believe it is a fabulous car. I can't wait to
get mine (should be here early October).

Cheers!

Subject: Re: The Car & Driver review

I've read that C&D review and uncovered contradiction and little clarity
in
their observations.  It was a fluff piece, an opportunity to put the
most
popular cars together to sell an otherwise empty edition.  C&D exposed
itself, once again, as a light weight rag.  They failed to make
legitimate
observations of the Boxster, the picked the hairdresser edition of the
911
and they let the world know they don't have what it takes to steer a
Ferrari around a track.  F'rinstance:

The shopping cart/off road suspension in the Boxster.
Why put the performance suspension on the 'vette and deprive the Boxster
of
the same option?  Even with this extraordinary advantage, the 'vette put
in
a disappointing show and the Boxster hardly failed, but it left one
frustrated at simply not having the 'real' car in the test.

Show boat Carrera S.
Of course taking the Turbo S to the comparison would have made for a
no-contest event, but not take a stock Carrera, without the excessive
rear
traction (for aesthetics only, in my opinion) of the Carrera S.  Each
criticism C&D made of the 911 pertained to having too much stick in the
rear.

Unknown drivers and inconsistent testing.
Unlike traditional performance and handling tests, where the objective
is
to remove the driver from the equation, C&D used different drivers in
cars
doing the same test, resulting in 'driver x made car x fly through the
cones, while driver y made car y look like a slug, thus we conclude that
car y is a slug' but strangely C&D did not give the credentials of their
drivers (again, unlike the Euro mags which routinely give a bio of each
driver assuming the driver doesn't go without introduction -- like using
world champion touring car drivers.)

Nevertheless, I agree that the 'real' M3 (not the underpowered US
version)
is arguably one of the finest handling cars in history, but it's just
not a
fair comparison, leading to a predictable outcome.  Is an M3 close to as
good as a Boxster with the same horses?  Is an M3 even in the same
paddock
as a Turbo or a Turbo S?  Why the hell is a Supra even in this comparo?

FWIW, since the early nineties and the 348tb/ts, Ferrari reliability has
been excellent and it's a common preference for Ferrari (and Porsche)
owners to pay extra for temperament -- that's why I drive a 964.

Cheers

Adam
