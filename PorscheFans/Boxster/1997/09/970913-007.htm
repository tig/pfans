A friend of mine, who doesn't have email, but does have a new Boxster
(300 miles), were out tonight, and his yellow "check" engine light
started flashing, for about 10 seconds, then stayed on. The manual says
"if it flashes continuously go immediately to a service station", then
continues to say "if it stays on (which, after ten seconds or
thereabouts it did for the next 3.1 miles, until it was safely home in
his garage), you can drive, but you should go to a service station and
have it checked."  

The question is, has anyone else experienced this little feat?  What was
the outcome or diagnosis? What kind of repairs, if any were needed? Is
it emmision? The trouble here in Charleston there are only about three
on the road, and the Porsche dealer mechanic is away at school right
now, and we'd love to have some interim diagnosis's!  Only other thing
that highlighted our evening, is upon startup we got a huge bellow of
blue smoke, and just before the "check" light came on, some ten minutes
later, we heard a rather loud pop, but thought we had run over a tin can
(?). After putting it to bed, we notice that the smell of the thing was
quite like something burning on a hot stove....

Let's see what the digest can come up with on this one!
