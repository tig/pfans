Greetings from Oregon,
      Perhaps we've had an inordinately beautiful rain-free summer here in
the Pacific Northwest, or perhaps our various parking facilities here are
terribly poor in asphalt/concrete hygiene,  but  I have been amazed at the
amount of dust my Boxster kicks up upon entering or leaving some parking
spaces.  I  wonder whether any of the rest of you have experienced this
phenomena?  I almost wish I could override the fan operation when
approaching/departing a parking space. Occasionally this can be quite an
annoyance when the top (as it almost always is) is stowed.  I like to keep my
car clean, inside and out, but I don't believe I'm neuroticly fastidious.
     Perhaps Porsche can design a filter so that we can use our cars to
vacuum our parking lots as we enter and leave  ;-) ?  Or perhaps we could use
the suction on track days to counter aerodynamic (body) lift ?     Any
thoughts or comments?
