Adam Green-- You said:
<<Nevertheless, I agree that the 'real' M3 (not the underpowered US version)
is arguably one of the finest handling cars in history, but it's just not a
fair comparison, leading to a predictable outcome.  Is an M3 close to as
good as a Boxster with the same horses?  Is an M3 even in the same paddock
as a Turbo or a Turbo S?  Why the hell is a Supra even in this comparo?>>

Just for some background, I have owned a '93 RS America for almost five
years, and instruct in the Chicago region PCA.  My car has been modified
quite extensively, and I have spent quite a bit of time at Road America,
Blackhawk, and Gingerman Raceways, in addition to autocrossing.  

I also own a new E36 M3 too, for a year.  I've bought three cars (2 Porsches,
and the M3) from the same dealer, Bill Jacobs Motorsports in Naperville,
Illinois who sponsors the Club Race here on Labor Day.  As such, I have had
the honor of driving  the Boxster, and the Z3 2.8 for moderate periods of
time.

We have a Boxster who autocrossed with R1s and HR lowering springs with a
good driver Shaun Young (since sold the car), and we've had a couple run at
Blackhawk and Road America. 

Now for my personal observations and experiences:

1) The "fake" US M3 has the same handling characteristics as the Euro model,
the obvious differences are the engine  and the sequential tranny.  Because
of the lower final drive gearing, higher torque below 3000 rpm, and $2000.00
of mods you can bolt on from catalogs, you can narrow the acceleration
difference 0-100 mph between the US and Euro versions to less than a second.
 With those mods its a $41,000 car new, but used ones can be had for
$28k-$32k.

2) The Fixed caliper brakes of the Boxster are far superior to the M3s
floating design which is street oriented, and will fade or warp rotors at the
track fairly easily.  Fade and modulation aside, they stop about the same.

3) The Boxster is a sexy sports car.  The M3 is a sedan and more luxurious

4)The M3, all things equal, on an autocross layout not even flaunting
horsepower, will still equal the Boxster at 9/10s talent driving.  In the
hands of someone who really knows what they are doing, at 10/10ths the
Boxster can be made to do more.  The hacks from car and driver were probably
more at ease in the M3 because of that 944-style balance which allows you to
go quite fast very quickly with minimal seat time.  

5) A Boxster with R1s, H&R springs, corner balancing and competition
alignment, and exhaust is a great performer.
