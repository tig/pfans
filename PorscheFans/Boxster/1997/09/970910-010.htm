Just thought I'd pass along experience in this last weekend's SCCA
autocross. On my second run after downshifting from third to first for a
tight 180 deg turn I went to shift to second on exiting the turn and
discovered a shift lever that was no longer connected to the
transmission! Pulled back into the paddock area to investigate. This had
happened to me before during a time trial in my 944 Turbo. In the 944
the shift lever is connected to the linkage with a pin and bushing
through the lever held in place with a "C" clip. The bushing had worn
allowing the pin to move around enough till eventually the "C" clip came
off and the pin fell out and no more shift lever connection. This was on
a car with 120,000 miles on it at the time. Boxster with 3300 miles on
it suddenly had that same loose lever feel. Pulling up the shift lever
boot skirt reveled the problem. The Boxster's lever is connected at the
bottom with a ball and cup arrangement. The end of the lever is the ball
with the linkage connected by a pressed on cup that appeared to be some
composite (not metal) material. Apparently in my exuberance I pushed the
lever forward a little too hard and "popped" the ball out of the cup. I
was able to "pop" it back together again by removing the ash tray then
the assembly that holds the ashtray and the window switches and sliding
an offset boxwrench through this opening and under the cup and push it
back on the ball. Back on the track I made sure I wasn't so
unnecessarily forceful on the shifts. After another six runs (lots of
"fun runs" ) I had no more problems - still don't think it's the best
way for this critical link to be connected!
Putting the Eibach springs on the car tonight (lowering it ~1" - 1.5")
and a K&N filter preping for this weekends PCA time trial. Anyone have
recommendations on track alignment specs for a lowered car? Would be
appreciative - the car is scheduled for realignment at the dealer Friday
a.m.. FYI I got the springs and K&N filter from Paragon Products last
week and he had plenty in stock if anyone else is looking. I'll comment
on the diff between the stock Sport Technic pkg and after its lowered
following this weekends event. In the mean time ----- Easy on the
shifter!
