     For the record, I never got anything from Porsche concerning 
     confirmation, so that is not any indicator.
     
     My car was a February build, which the dealer could confirm, 
     but it didn't arrive till early April.  So there is a 4 to 8 
     week difference between build and availability at the 
     dealer, at least based on my experience.
     
     But it is all worth it.  Car has 9400 miles on it now, and I 
     continue to love driving it.

It seems to me that the dealer is being overly optimistic. I ordered my 
boxster last feb. Before I placed the order, I was told it would be here 
June. Right after I placed the order, they said august to october. It's 
september right now, and it's still not here yet.
     
Just my experience ...
