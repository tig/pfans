PFans,

	Just to shed a bit more light on what is involved in changing the 
oil on the boxster.  I had mine on a lift last week for a pre-track tech 
inspection.  There is a single oil drain plug, and the filter hangs down 
at the bottom.  There are not covers or access panels to remove.

	Its similar to my Saturn, for which the dealer charges $26 for a 
routine oil change.  Allowing for more, higher priced Mobil 1, about $60 
to $75 sounds like a fair price (a subscriber to this list reported a 
price of about $60 from a Boston area dealer.

	Just cause I like Porsches, doesn't mean I have a lot of excess 
cash I want to contribute to the dealer.  Just my $.02 (maybe $.07 by 
now).

PFans,

	I just received my Becker Silverstone 2660 6CD changer directly 
from Becker (Saddlebrook NJ) for $400 (half dealer cost)-- this is the 
identical unit that Porsche puts in the Boxster (different label).  
Well-- one difference is the mount, (the Porsche mount for $25 does not 
require drilling in the trunk, the Becker mount, that comes with the unit 
requires drilling).

	To install the unit, you will need the radio removal keys from 
Becker (and you will have to reenter the radio code after reinstalling 
the radio).  I tried the CD changer (not fully installed yet) and it 
works fine.

	PROBLEM -- I don't know how to route the cable from the radio to 
the trunk.  I called PCNA for help, and they just called my dealer's 
service department (of the $140 oil change) who gave me a call and said 
they would be back to me, that was four days ago, I'm not holding my 
breath.  Sooooo -- has anyone out there done this installation?  If so, 
how?
