In response to Steve Hubbard's inquiry about experience with the check engine
light, here is our story (tried to transmit this last Friday to you all, but
the "Webmaster" wouldn't accept it because I used my office email address
which is not registered for this site):

We picked up our arctic silver/black Boxster on August 28.  When I turned on
the engine the first time, the "check engine" light stayed on.  I asked the
salesman to have a technician check it, which he did.  He couldn't find
anyting wrong, so he turned it off and sent me on my way.  Drove it home;
upon starting it about 6 hours later, the light came on and stayed on again.
 We drove it about 30 miles and noticed that it surged at idle and smoke was
coming out of the exhaust.  We called the dealer first thing the next
morning--they said to bring it in--but that we had to wait until after the
Labor Day weekend because they had no technicians due to vacations!
Thus, very limited driving over the weekend--no trips as we had planned.  We
experienced more surging, smoke, rough idle, and strong exhaust odors (mostly
"rotten egg"/hydrogen sulfide odors).  Also, noticed that gas consumption was
very
high!  Took it on the Tuesday after Labor Day and the dealership had the car
for 8 days--trying everything to determine the cause of the problem.  Fouled
plugs, too rich fuel mixture, bad O2 sensors--all were symptoms of a problem.
 Finally, with the help of a Porsche America specialist, they determined that
a low voltage connector for the O2 sensors was to blame.  Once that was
addressed, new plugs and O2 sensors were installed, the car ran fine.  We
took it on a 250 mile day trip yesterday and it was sweet!  We hope the worst
is over--it was terribly frustrating to have the car and not be able to drive
it, and then to not have it for 8 days was even worse!  

p.s. With regard to the earlier discussion of the best complement to a
Boxster, we are happy with our "fleet" configuration.  The 7 series BMW is
wonderful--my wife wants to "keep it forever", and the Jeep gets us through
the ice and snow (which is not severe in DC most years!).
