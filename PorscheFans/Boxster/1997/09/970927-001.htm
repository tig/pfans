<<The boomerang conspiracy>>

AOL addresses are easy to come by.  It does not, necessarily, mean someone
would stoop so low to get a three to five dollar sign 'em up bonus and
pollute this message area with thinly veiled, shill like 'boomerangs are
great', 'where do I get one?', 'what was that tel. no. again?' notes.

Some of you may think our resident boomerang evangelist is getting a kickback
for every one sold via his marketing, but it is actually more sinister than
that.
Each boomerang is embedded with a micro chip which, upon a signal, causes the
cars to turn purple, tires turn into cheap Nikes, and then join the mother
ship streaking along behind a comet.
One day you boomerang owners will wake up with the car gone!
Or, worse yet, you are in the car at the moment the signal is given!!

I agree there may be something rotten in Denmark I also know, for certain,
there is a lurker amongst us who will soon slam the gavel and stop all this
'boomerung' nonsense.
Why not agree to leave the subject alone?  Let's move on....
