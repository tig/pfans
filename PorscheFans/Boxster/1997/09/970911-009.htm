Was this recent?  My dealer, (and from the postings on this list most
dealers) have been instructed by Porsche to ship the engine/transmission
back to Porsche and put in an entire new powerplant rather than do
anything locally to solve engine/transmission issues or leaks.  My
dealer wanted to do replace the seal of a friends boxster about 2 months
ago, Porsche said no, send it to them.  (I hope Porsche's version of
Plug-and-Play works better than Uncle Bills).

Cheers,  RC
