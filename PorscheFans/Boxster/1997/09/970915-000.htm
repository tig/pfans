I was at a Driver=92s Education this past weekend.  On the first session =
of the
day (Saturday morning) I was following this Black Boxster and in turn 4 o=
f
the fourth lap he spun.  It whipped around so fast that it seemed to spin
like a toy top whereas a 911 comes around much slower.  And then when he =
hit
the dirt it was like he created a tornado effect - for two more laps the =
dirt
was swirling around.  Spoke to him after the incident - He had the TC
(traction control) on.   I would think this would have helped prevent the
spin or at least the speed it twirled around in.  He even knocked a tire =
off
one of the rear rims.

Maybe this is why I have read that Porsche AG does not want to Boxster ra=
ced
- keep it a commuter car.

Anyone see or have any similar experience/comment to share.=20
