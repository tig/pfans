     My Silver/Red/17" etc car arrived last Wednesday. At last after 
     ordering in January.
     
     Not much to add to the forum after just 300km, my general opinion is 
     its great and I can't wait till "1000km" are up to get some serious 
     RPM going! I haven't got lost yet in Tokyo, but did manage to find a 
     traffic jam in a half mile long tunnel on my first roof down trip - I 
     was very glad of the speedy top up facilty. In the '74 MGB I had at 
     university I would have had to suffocate for 20mins in car fumes!
     
     On the speedo front (apologies if someone else has already posted this 
     info...) Autocar just did a comparison test of Z3 2.8 vs the Boxster 
     (which of course the Boxster wins!), and they included some gear 
     ratios / mph per rpm numbers so I thought they might be useful. 
     
     (Not sure formatting will work here.....)
     
                Ratio   Mph / 1000      Mph at 3000
     1st        3.50    5.4             16.2
     2nd        2.12    8.9             26.7
     3rd        1.43    13.3            39.9
     4th        1.03    18.4            55.2
     5th        0.79    24.0            72.0
     Final Drv  3.88            
     
     Hope this helps those speed demons out there... Anyone seen an 
     indicated 150mph yet???? I've seen 165 but that was only Kmh and I'm 
     limited by my RPM cap whilst running in.
     
     Cheers
