have to be an expert mechanic to do this or is it easy enough for me to do
this at home?>>
Changing oil in the car is very simple.  Jack the car as high as is safe or
put it on a lift. You will need a container that holds at least 10 quarts.
 On the bottom of the engine, centered, is a recessed 8 mm allen bolt. This
is the drain plug. The oil filter in on the left side back of the engine
under the car.  It takes a end cap wrench (every parts store will carry this)
that will measure 74 mm across the flat part. It will take 9 quarts. The
filter housing is made of plastic. How long will that take the heat???
Unscrew the oil filter housing and throw away the inside filter and replace
with a new one. The filter comes with a sealing ring.  The filter and the crus
h ring for the drain plug cost $17 at the dealer. Good luck.
