Pfans,

	I took my P38 equipped Boxster to Limerock today for its first 
driver's ed track event & boy did it make me a proud papa (even on the 
factory-stock SO2s.  Mostly it just stuck to the track, steering 
absolutely predictable and precise.  On a couple of the straights, in 
some of the early laps, a turbo blew by me on the straights, but in the 
twisties, the Boxster absolutely ruled (another 50 or so horsepower would 
be dandy though, 100 would make it awsome).  I was passing almost 
everything, and very little was passing me (even lapped a few cars in 30 
min session).

Re: spinning, it started to come around to a couple of times at the end 
of the front straight (where I didn't slow down quite enough at the end 
of the straight, and had to "trail brake" a little excessively.  A timely 
straightening of the wheel brought it right back into trim.  At times 
when I was committed to a turn and had to get off the throttle a bit, (to 
avoid mating with the Porsches in front) there was no hint of rotation.  
Turn ins were instantaneous, and precise.  

I am not that skilled or experienced a drover, so the Boxster helped me a 
lot with its forgiving manners, properly prepared (read more power) this 
will be an awsome race car (maybe Porsche wants to race it first -- as I 
recall, the 914 wasn't supposed to be a race car either).

Re: spinning like a top, if you're going to spin out of control does it 
make any difference how fast you spin?  A few fractions of a second more 
to catch a car that is rotating may be nice, but you should be 
straigtening the wheel as you GENTLY lift the throttle, or caress the 
brake before you start to spin -- no matter what you drive.  (BTW my 
Satrun SC2 with front wheel drive oversteers at the limit in moderate 
speed turns, things like tire pressure also contribute to handling 
characteristics).

Today it was one of the slower spinning 911s that got the acrobatic 
kudos.  Coming out of West Bend (a high speed right hander leading into a 
downhill shoot) this red 911 did a pirouette and cartwheel down the hill 
and off the tire wall.  Thankfully only one car invovled and the driver 
wasn't seriously hurt, but the car was totalled, every surface and window 
was smashed (makes a broken radiator and toasted wheel sound pretty 
good).  However, kudos to the strength of the 911 coupe that protected 
its driver.

That's all for now.
