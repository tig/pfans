Yesterday, on a morning drive through commuters I was spied by a black
Boxster (while I talked on the phone, unaware of him on my bumper then on my
right flank).
We got to ride together for a few miles, trading places, admiring each
others' cars.  
It's really something special to see a Boxster on the road, what a GREAT
looking car!

It's like asking the question of a Boxster owner, "Have you ever seen the top
cycle up & down?"  Almost never, we're always inside it!!  We rarely get the
chance to see one on the road either.

In the evening, returning from a car inspection on the coast (two hour drive)
I spied a silver Boxster with hardtop ahead.  It took ten miles to catch up
to it, in heavy traffic.  A great looking car too (of course, they all are).
We road together for a few miles, but then I spooled up to cruise (80+ mph)
so I didn't see them much after that.  Definitely lost them in the rain.  [He
put the USAC sticker on his rear 'bumper' (!)]

Cannot stress enough, at 11,700 miles, my Boxster gets better and better.
 It's great FUN, all the time.  I gotta tell you, it's a fabulous car.

Stiffer springs, more horsepower, special exhaust, chips, GT racing stripes-
whatever suits your fancy I suppose.  Box stock is still capital F - U - N.  
For what I do with it most of the time, just driving enthusiastically, it's
fine.  
Modifying it to meet a spec intended for competition or high performance, how
much use would I get out of that investment?  Pretty near nil.
The road from my house to wherever I'm going is populated by traffic signals,
poor drivers, and pot holes.  I can make a game out of it, pretending one or
the other, or all, are components of a would be race track, but it's still
just regular driving 99% of the time the ignition is on.

If you don't have a Boxster, get one.  If you have one, enjoy it.  
Don't leave it holed up in the closet, take it out and have FUN.
