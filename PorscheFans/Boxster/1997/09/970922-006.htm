RE: Snow Tires

 16" or 17"?  Use the same wheels?  The manual recomends a 16" tire for
snow.  I'm sure a good 17 would also be just fine. Porsche's European
publication, Christophorus, usually does a winter tire review in the
late fall (as they did in the spring).  I'll keep my eye open for it.

The downside of remounting different rubber twice/yr on same rims is
that w/mounting, rebalancing, handling, eventually they'll get dinged
up. I have good Fikse's on now & will start shopping soon for winter
rubber to go on the Porsche 17's.  On my 911 I go from 18s to 17s in the
winter & like the Pirelli 210's as a very good winter tire (here in
Wisconsin). Maybe I'll find something better than the 210s now?

Speaking of SNOW, I too was not following the roof rack thread closely,
can the rack hold ski's?  and go over the hardtop?  is there a pic
anywhere that someones aware of?     Thanks    Gregg
