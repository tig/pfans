     What parts of the country are we talking about.  Here in New 
     England you need a car capable of dealing with the winters, 
     with packed snow, ice, deep snow over non-level terrain.
     
     My last BMW sedan was a 735i, and it was downright dangerous 
     in the winter.  In fact, I ended up refusing to drive it in 
     bad (including wet) weather.
     
     Are the new 7 series better, with improved traction control, 
     etc. so that they are truly a winter car?
     
     TIA for your response.

WDB,
     
Interesting choice for a second car, but would not be my choice. 
According to the official stats, the '97 850 takes 6.6 seconds 0 - 60, 
(vs. the boxster 6.7), and has trunk space of 9.5 cubic feet (vs. the 
boxster's 9.1)  You can count on an early 90's 850 to be slower.  They 
occupy the same relative space, except the boxster is more fun and the 
styling is much more effective.   If you are looking for a coupe, get an 
early 993.  It too has a useless rear seat, but it is substantially 
faster than the 850, and is a lot cheaper to maintain than the 12 
cylinder.  .  
     
I'm in the process of trading out my 94 540i for a 96 or 97 7 series, if 
I can find a low mileage 750il I'm going to take it.  It's fast, 
comfortable, room for 5 big adults, and a trunk that works.  That 
combination (Boxster and 750il)  works, at least for me.
