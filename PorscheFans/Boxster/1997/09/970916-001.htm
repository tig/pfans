While a governer like TC can aid in mollifying abhorrent road conditions I
sincerely doubt it was intended to 'prevent' spins from forceable
overextension.

There is a window of performance for a car, commonly called 'the envelop',
with clearly defined limits.  Pushing a car up to, and sometimes beyond, that
edge is what high performance driving is all about.
Hence our fabulous driving school program.
You take the driver's school to learn where that fine line is, just in case
-during normal day-to-day commuting- you need to call on those
characteristics of performance to avoid collisions or mishaps.

TC uses the wheel sensors to calculate inequitable wheel spin.  An affect of
TC is to limit power through modulated acceleration, either in modifying fuel
flow or actual misfiring the distributor (like the rev limiter does when
over-revving the engine).
Once in a spin, TC is pretty much useless.  It's 'both feet in' and nothing
else.
About a quarter turn into the spin described it becomes a matter of kissing
your ass goodbye, not pulling out of the spin and continuing the circuit.  
Fighting the forces at work can often worsen the result.
Heroes don't commiserate through bandages over burgers in the pits.

I've owned three cars with TC, and drove all three at the track during events
like this.  All three were rear wheel drive cars.  I never believed in the
higher Zen of TC, unless the track was wet.
Only in those instances did the TC shine;  I could pick any line, push to the
limiter, then back off a hair.  In this fashion I knew I was driving right to
the edge.
I could always wait until I was alone on a section, then push beyond the
envelop to see what would occur.
If I did slide or spin, I -most assuredly- wouldn't expect the TC to slow or
stop the event.  A lost cause is still a lost cause.
