well, at some considerable risk of thread creation, i put forth the following
thoughts on the indicated subject:

after spending a number of years in the advertising agency account service
business, about 12 years ago i resigned the vice presidency and opened my
first quick lube....it is not a jiffy lube.......but it's concept mirrors
their service list...quick service .....  routine checks of powertrain
components and  an overall under hood check.  price for such service runs in
the mid twenty dollar range and is usually completed in a few minutes....lots
of discussion concerning what prices are charged for the boxster oil filter
change and a most recent comment indicating no need to be a phd to change the
oil and filter.....simple drain plug replacement and add correct amount of
replacement oil and  replace filter  and your outta there.........let me
offer this insight.........knowing more than i ever wanted to know about my
business.........if you cannot find a quick lube where there is active
management [read owner there several times a week] you better either do it
yourself or pay the dealer the  hundred or so bucks!   You 're welcome to
visit any of my centers and relax in air conditioned comfort reading the
latest copies of R/T -car and driver-excellence-wallstreet
journal-autoweek-pano or the other 20 or so current publications while we
concern ourselves with making sure the correct oil type and quantity is
installed after using the proper sized tool to remove and replace the drain
plug with correct gasket.  same goes for the insert oil filter assy. and
associated o ring gasket........... including proper sized tool for it's
removal.....all the time being careful to make sure all checked items are
returned to their orginial untouched condition.  remember all those
undertrays that obstruct access to various undervehicle  items must be
removed and reinstalled with fasteners..........no grease on the fenders or
mats or steering wheel.....correct air pressures checked at each corner and a
neat and readable reciept with any additional service recommendations.......
let me tell you......i cannot get techs, who can perform the simple items we
all know are important but relatively easy to perform time after time day
after day, and pay them macdonald's wages...how do i get them?  i pay them a
decent wage and  hold them accountable......where do i get the cash to pay
them this wage....why from you the customer  that's where......so the moral
to this story is......never take any vehicle to a quick lube and go sit in
the waiting room ........why  because they don't pay their techs a living
wage and the turnover is unbelievable....the tech working on your $55,000
porsche is probably "learning on your car"  and was painting houses last week
 and was all beered up until 4 30 am ........last night...... "ahh this size
is close enuff and the heck with putting all the screws back on this
undertray.. it sure don't need twelve of these when 4 will hold it
up........"  now, as i said before, you can visit any of my centers and relax
 but in any of the big national, well known centers,  you pays your money and
you gets your service.......so when you go in to the place for the service
because they are the cheapest with this coupon...think about it  for a few
minutes....the cheapest is sometimes the most expensive.......just my $.05
 worth  and by the way, this is only a tinny tinny bit of the whole inside
view.....i could write a 300 page book on this and you would not believe it!
