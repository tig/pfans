I drive a 1995 M3 and I couldn't agree more with your statement.  It doesn't
get the looks that the porsches get.  I also drive all kinds of porsches, and
no matter what porsche I drive it always gets more attention then the "320i
on steriods"...... ?????, that part I disagree with......maybe a 328iS on
steriods.   The M3 is a joy to drive!   Is attention is what driving is all
about?  I don't think so.  The M3 is more civilized for everyday use then any
of my porsches.  Although, I don't have a boxster yet.  But, it doen't have a
back seat either.   Here's an change-of-subject for you...... The new 911,  I
don't like it.  To me it looks like everything else out there.  Do you think
it will turn heads?   Time will tell.

Sincerely,  Matt Groner
