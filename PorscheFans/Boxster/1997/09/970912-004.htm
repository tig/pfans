Changing the springs on the Boxster is not as easy as on many cars. The
dealer shows 8 hrs on the book. With expert help at home the job was
completed in 8.5 hours (12.5 man hours, 2 people the last 4 hours).
Regarding the comment concerning how do I know the Eibach springs are
stiffer than the factory Sport Technic springs ----- I don't and would
appreciate any data on the factory springs, I haven't been able to
locate it yet. I do know that the height to the top of the fender lip
dropped from 26 7/8" to 25 5/8" with the spring change and the short (15
mile) "settling trip" to the dealer this a.m. for the alignment.
The Eibach springs are progressive (as the factory springs also appear
to be) with rates of 105 - 195 for the front and 125 - 205 in the rear.
They don't "feel" softer from my short ride. The autocross school on
saturday and time trial on sunday should help sort out my feelings on
the change. In regards to alignment I received no rec's on this from the
list, but here's what I went with for the few that may be interested:
Front - 45" (3/4 deg) negative camber
Rear - 2 deg negative. Factory rec's are US Front @ + 5", ROW Sport @
-15" +_ 30"; Rear - 1 1/2 deg negative.  
Drop the top and enjoy the weekend!
