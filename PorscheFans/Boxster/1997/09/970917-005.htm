After a meeting downtown, dinner and drinks, I drive the 20 miles North home.

I'm passed at a pretty good clip on a six lane wide thoroughfare, doing an
indicated 47 mph, he's doing probably 65 mph in his 5.0 '97 Mustang.
We go underneath the overpass to the connector road to the Interstate, he
cuts across all three lanes in front of me to catch the egress entry.
I figure, what the hay, let's see what that little ol' Mustang can do.

I drop in behind, accelerating (of course), picking the nicest turn in (lots
of practice).
He brakes a bit, and definitely slows down.
I've got a whole lot of kinetic energy built up, and I'm still accelerating,
and bundle up his rear bumper quickly.  He picks the high line, I dive in low
(it's a beautiful banked turn), and pass on the inside (of a one lane
road.... there is NO inside lane!)  Probably passing him at twice his speed.

All that energy and still lots of room to accelerate, I apply copious
throttle just to show how nicely this Boxster of mine handles (even against th
at torquey V-8).
I leave him in the dust, and don't back off until I hit an even hundred along
the crest and down the slope to the traffic light.

He rolls down the window, not smiling.
I look over to tell him his fog lights are on (on a perfectly clear night)
and see he's a local policeman, just getting off duty....
He's a little pissed (and I didn't even get the fog light thing out of the
mouth), gets out of the car and asks me, "You a resident of this city?"
"Well, no sir, I'm not."
"Wasn't that move a little unacceptable??"  Demanding I give him full
attention and an appropriately subordinate answer.
"But of course," I answer with a deliberate pause, "but it was a clean pass."

He radios in my particulars (the light is green by now) and lets me go on my
way.
Dodged a bullet, I think.
By my estimation, about $6,000.00 worth.

Lesson;  don't be too stoopid.
It's a fun car, not ROOD!
