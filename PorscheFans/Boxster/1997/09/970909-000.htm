Interesting to note the C&D article (it hasn't yet come out in Australia)
rated the 911 better than the 986 for handling. I seem to remember Walter
Rohrl (Past World Rally champion, Porsche test pilot and in house living
legend) who has driven every porsche racing or otherwise produced in the
last 30 years stating in Christophorus that when the road gets tight the
Boxster wins and when the 911 can use its superior power it wins. Period. I
think I'll take the word of the factory test driver with no axe to grind
and long term knowledge of the cars over the word of some journo's who had
the cars for a few days. 

While not being able to drive as well or quantify the differences as well
as Mr Rohrl or the journo's, I would be surprised if any one could come to
appreciate the limits of a 911 in a short acquaintance. Having owned one
for 13 years it took more than a few days to find the limits. Maybe these
guys never did find the limits? You need a lot of brave pills to. The
Boxster is much, much more user friendly and for my money a better handler.
That doesn't mean i can't get a 911 around some corners quicker, because if
it was a short straight before hand I would be entering faster, and after
the apex accelerating harder due to the superior power. But just because I
went around the corner quicker does not make the car a better handler or as
much fun.
  
Sorry to take up so much bandwidth, just my 2 cents with a different
perspective
