Being of Scottish heritage, the zipper on my purse is short and tight.
The prospect of paying $100 for an oil change bothers me.  Oil is oil
and it all comes from the ground.  Okay, maybe the synthetic stuff
doesn't exactly qualify and with R&D and marketing expense, Mobil et.
al. have the opportunity to charge more for a better product.  I have
my 95-850 Turbo Volvo serviced every 3,000 miles at the dealership and
they use synthetic Valvoline.  Cost for oil change, labor, filter, and
O-ring is $40.00.  I suspect Jiffy Lube prices are comparable.  One
does not have to be a factory trained technician to unscrew a pan plug
and filter.  So I see no justification for these $100 to $160 oil
change costs.  As a matter of curiosity, I intend on calling our two
local Porche dealers to learn the price of an oil/filter change.
