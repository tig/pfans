<< Now since I paid a premium for genuine Porsche aftermarket 
      accessories, and used on genuine Porsche provided tools for the 
      express purpose for which they were intended, why should I be saddled 
      with an extra $60 for the dealer to correct a problem caused by 
      either, a poor quality Porsche supplied tool, screws that were 
      installed to tight at the factory, or frozen in place by the paint, or 
      that were too soft to begin with, or a poorly designed after-market 
      Porsche product.  It's not like I sullied my Porsche with something 
      other than a genuine Porsche after market accessory (which in 
      retrospect I wish I had done. >>

Bob:

I doubt that there is a single person who has owned (and loved) Porsches for
many years who hasn't broken fasteners, head studs, questioned valve
adjustment clearance, etc and cursed the "GD German design philosophy or
assembly execution".  The pleasure of owning and driving these machines
usually (but not always) compensates for their always inherent "flaws".

Every "new series" production Porsche ever built has had some initial
"teething" problems.   While most of these are corrected in early serial
production, some design deficiencies will "linger" far beyond what should
reasonably be expected for a highly competent engineering organization.  In
earlier 911s,weight and balance solutions, use of Alusil cases, chain
tensioner design, etc, etc, etc, are all examples of reluctance to change
what were perceived as innovative or "acceptable" design practices flawed
with longer than expected continued serial production .  There remains
(varying over the years ) always a degree of "Arrogance was Expected" or "Vee
know what is best for you" in  German design and production philosophy (MB
and BMW also exhibit) which sometimes requires a "rude awakening" brought
about by competition or market realities. 

By all accounts, including those on this list, the Boxster's "teething
problems" seem far less than the early 356, 911, 924/44, 928 serial
production and reflects a positive indication of "lessons learned" and vastly
improved production processes over the years.  I suspect the "ill-fitting top
down latching" problems reported here will be corrected relatively early on
while the "debris protection of critical components- et al Boomerang
solution" will likely remain for an extended period with internal arguments
on redesign likely already occurring within Porsche AG .

Your indication of the frustration of encountering overly tight fasteners and
perhaps an inadequate "factory approved" tool for removal as being a "major
displeaser" might indicate a level of expectation which could affect your
long term satisfaction with Porsche ownership.  I would suggest you enjoy the
car for what it is; a unique driving machine fully in the Porsche tradition
soundly a step above it's current competition (got to be careful here, these
were the same thoughts on the 944 in it's first couple of years) and offered
at a "relatively" bargain price.
