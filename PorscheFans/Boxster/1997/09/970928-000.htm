     My car did have two stickers, both on the Driver's side sun visor - 
     written in Japanese. I removed them with some trepidation after the 
     stories in the forum about marks.
     
     But both stickers came off no problem leaving no marks behind. I guess 
     that Porsche delivers them to Japan without the sticker and the 
     dealers add the Japanese stickers which are less vicious than in other 
     markets (?).
     
     Surely some Porsche distributor somewhere must be able to get you one 
     without a sticker....

     some serious top down motoring.

Dan,
     
Since your Boxster was delivered to Japan, do the sun visors have the 
same ugly yellow air-bag-warning decals that we in the US got?
     
I removed the decals from my sun visors, but the results are far from 
satisfactory, so I'm looking for a new set of visors without decals.
     
I stopped at a Porsche dealer in London two weeks ago and found that 
the Boxster's in their showroom did not have the decals.  Joy! So I 
tried to buy a set of visors there, but when we opened up the boxes we 
found that the new replacement visors in the UK all have the decal!
