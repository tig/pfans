I was two days off on the child seats.  Thursday your dealer should have the
parts numbers on his/her computer.  PCNA has over a thousand seats in stock
(three sizes will be offered).

Also, in late October, Porsche will be putting out a catalogue on Boxster and
911 accessories.  There will be hundreds of items (both large and small)
ready for the Christmas rush.  I've been told al bunch of new, really cool
stuff will be listed.  I guess Porsche finally realized there's gold to be
mined out there in aftermarket land...

One last thing.  I just upgraded my upgraded upgrade.  I went with the
Kenwood PS907 receiver (still with the stealth face plate) instead of the KDC
9007.  This uint has an eight volt preamp built in.  Put on the Vaughn
Brothers "Family Style" CD track 3.  Blew my socks off!!!!  Rodeo Audio says
no problem putting in rear speakers behind the seats.  It just takes - you
guessed it - money!
