those pictures appear to be stills from when the boxster was still being shown
but not sold...
its most likely an early version...becuz when the mags were first getting info
on the boxster and their first test drives the car didnt have cup holders AT
ALL... but the cup holders were promised to be standard by the time the car
came out jan 3 1997. they most likey arent available ANYWHERE...

I have a full boxster red interior w/ carbon fiber on the heating and stero
controls as well as my steering wheel and shifters... also trying to get the
trim strip and the guage housing...
the carbon fiber accents look fabulous... but dont come cheap.. the shifters
stereo/heater and steering wheel came to about 3grand...
but it looks to fabulous to turn down... I figure this baby is mine till the
day they pry her from my cold dead hands... I'm worth it... and so is the cost.
60k for a boxster is hard to pull off unless you go SUPER crazy and get
everything under the sun... I believe if you get EVERYTHING literally it will
cap out at about 65-68k.
