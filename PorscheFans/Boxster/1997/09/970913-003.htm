Picked up my Black on Black Boxster yesterday.  Love the car and so apparently 
 does everyone who drives by me on the San Diego Fwy.  In LA one has to be 
careful about the various signals one gives or receives but my sense is that 
fingers in the air are bad opposing thumbs in the air are good.   Have seen 
lots of the latter.  

Not to spoil the party but how come everything in the automotive world has 
changed over the past twenty years except "old" Porsche drivers?  Whats with 
all the chat about changing the oil on the Boxster?  These cars just don't 
require the maintenance you all seem to think they do.  Read the 
manual...unless your are racing, autocrossing or the like once a year or 15k 
miles and that's it.  I'll bet you oil changers are all still using fountain 
pens.  Am I right???

Thanks to all of you who provided me all of the valuable info over the past 
few months.  Especially K16K16@aol.com  thanks for the aftermarket and parts 
location addresses...

I'm off to Malibu for a little lunch and a run up the coast.  In the mean time 
all your oil changes be sure to catch that 1750 mile change and don't spill 
any F-1 on the rugs in the trunk.
