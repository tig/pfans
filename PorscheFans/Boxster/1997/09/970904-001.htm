John,

>Question 1:  Is everyone in the U.S. either  paying a premium over 
>sticker to get their Boxster or waiting until the following year?  

People who pay over sticker are usually buying used cars or working 
through unethical dealers.  Any dealer who charges you more than sticker 
price for a new Boxster should be reported to PCNA.  These dealers are 
having their allotments cut back.  Of course, when it comes to used 
Boxsters, the price is whatever the market will bear.

>Question 2:  I read something about an S Model that will have a 250 >HP 
engine.  Is this reality and if so, is it worth waiting for?

The Boxster S is rumored - development of a performance-enhanced Boxster 
is underway (Berkeley spoke to the engineers when he was in Stuttgart), 
but details haven't been made official.  Best guess is the first models 
won't appear until '99 models at the earliest (meaning a year from now).  
Price will probably be $5-10k more than current.

Mark
