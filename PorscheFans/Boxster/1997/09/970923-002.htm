As some of you may recall, I've gone through the drill of getting my
hard top after I bought my Silver/Red Boxster. I ordered the parts that
must be installed before the hard top can go on and decided to wait
until my 7500 mile service get them installed. Fearing as much as a 4
hour labor charge (according to some member of this list), I was
pleasantly surprised when Barrier Motors (Bellevue, WA) apparently
installed the parts in under an hour. The total cost of installation was
$56.00. Not bad at all. And to make things even better, I was not gouged
on the 7500 mile service as some people have been. They charged me a
total of $72.00 which included, among other things, an oil disposal fee.

Needless to say, I was a very happy camper. They even fixed the
recurring problem with the passenger-side soft-top no going into the
groove on top up. Kudos to Barrier's service department.
