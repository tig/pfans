Heck.  So the Perfect Porsche has a closet spin-dry cycle, eh?
Well, at least sending a US$40K Boxster into the Armco is less painfull
than an AUD$110K equivalent.
For the life of me, I couldn't get anything but a smooth release of a
Boxster on the 17" (much to the amazement of the dealer who, in January,
assured me "it just holds on no matter what") so it's now strangely
intriguing to get a Boxster with slicks on the track (with good run off
areas.)
Perhaps this is why Porsche is (disgustingly) shy of the track with the
Boxster?
As someone mentioned today, "race what you sell"!
Suddenly, the car has more appeal -- I guess I still need my 911.
