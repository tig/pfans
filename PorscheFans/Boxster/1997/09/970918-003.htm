A few days someone wrote asking if anyone considered the XK8 before buying
the Boxster.  As a former owner of 2 Jags, including an E type, I did, and
these were my conclusions:
1)  An automatic is not a sports car, sorry, but tradition and fun prevails
here.  XK8 only comes with automatic.
2)  Price, $20,000 difference
3)  Styling:  Always a subjective issue, I like the front and profile of the
XK8 but the stern looks like every other contemporary car.  To suggest the
stern of the two are similar goes beyond subjective reasoning, they are
definately different.  The Boxster stern was designed as part of the car, not
as an afterthought, ie. "since we just ran out of space"!  It has tail lights
that are designed and unique, not something to cover a trunk lid and comply
with laws.
4)  Sad to say, the XK8 is another boulevard/highway cruiser, more sporty
than the L series, but nonetheless, not a true sports car.
It pained me, because I do lover Jaguars.
