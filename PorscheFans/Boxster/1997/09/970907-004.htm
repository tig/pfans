Well, I knew I should have kept my mouth (keyboard) shut.  You may
recall I posted last week saying all was fine... Well, although it's
nothing major, I thought I'd share the pain.  While getting my car hand
washed at the local car wash, on of the guys drying it accidentally got
the towel caught on the right edge of the "Boxster" badge on the rear
trunk and broke off the "r" revealing the black foam adhesive tape
underneath.  I recovered the piece and am debating what to do about it.
1.  I can glue it back (the piece fits well) - any suggestions on glue,
etc.

2.  I can order a new badge and have it put on at the dealership (seems
too neorotic!)

3.  I can take the rest of it off and leave it clean as some others on
the list have (this is also a N/C option from the factory) - Not sure I
think it would look pretty cool, but the S.O. likes it as it was.

4.  Leave it as is... (I like this option the least)  :-(

This seems like it could happen to anyone not very careful while drying
the car.  I myself have come close a couple of times.  Any of you done
the same?  Oh well, such is life.  By the way, I am intrigued by the
speedo variance from actual and curious about my own car.  Any place I
can get it checked for free in the NYC area?  Thanks!
