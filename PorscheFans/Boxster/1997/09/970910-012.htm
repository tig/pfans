I hear good things from long time Andersen Behel customers if you're that
far South.
I would imagine that Stead in Walnut Creek could do a good job because
their facilities 'look' good, but I have not imperical data.
I would imagine that Carlsen run a premium on their work, but that
shouldn't effect your warrant and they do seem to run a big operation.
There's a small Porsche dealer off 101 and Broadway that carriers a
reasonable stock of 993s so they could well have service facilities to
match their showrooms, but their salesman no nothing (or close to it) about
the Boxster and I've _never_ seen them with one (despite shopping for six
months at every dealer in the Bay Area.)
I've had nothing but trouble with Negherbon and I've not found anyone to
defend them in the year or so that I've suffered their existence --
personal opinion only, your mileage may vary.
Let's see, that leaves Sonnen in Mill Valley, they seem pretty second hand
and carry a junkyard of cars and they're willing to have very second rate
cars in their yard without attempting to bring those cars up to snuff.
I can't imagine you meant Sacramento, so that excludes Nielo, but they're
apparently good and carry a sizeable inventory -- you can see I use
turnover as a gauge of their percentage (COGS) for investment in a service
department.
And there's Claridges in Fremont (or thereabouts) which is a huge
dealership with a small inventory of Porsche, but they do carry just about
every volume prestige marque except Ferrari (BMW, Porsche, Audi, Mercedes)
and their standards seem high (they just don't carry anything older than a
pristine 964.)  Assuming you judge the standards of salesman on dollar
value, not the real inate value of a given vehicle.

So for a warrant job, eat from the top of the menu and go to Carlsen or
Claridges.  I guess.  If you're South, I trust Andersen Behel and if you're
North, well, travel South.

What's the leak and the 'minor items'?

Cheers

Adam
