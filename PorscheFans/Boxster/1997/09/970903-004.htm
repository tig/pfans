     Pfans,
     
     Some random answers to question posted, plus some $.02.
     
     My gas mileage has ranged between 22 and 28 MPG over 2K miles.  (28 
     MPG at highway speeds of 70-75 MPH according to the speedo).
     
     My odometer reads about 3% high, and the speedo reads between 6 - 8% 
     high (dividing timed distance over measured mile at about 75MPH) with 
     17 inch wheels.
     
     Re: the spoiler, I've raised and lowered mine without the switch 
     migrating.  If you want to try to resurrect it yourself, without major 
     surgery or fishing, the cover surrounding the switch pops off easily 
     (it's the fuse panel cover, check your manual).
     
     Re: M3 handling vs Boxster w/ tech sport package.  If you want to 
     steer the Boxster rear end, try turning of the traction control.  BTW, 
     the Active Brake Differential (ABD) will brake the spinning wheel, so 
     instead of losing the rear due to loss of acceleration, you can keep 
     it under control, even when you unweight the inside wheel.  Re: the 
     numeric advantage of the M3, I'm personally more interested in the 
     lateral and stopping numbers than acceleration (0-60 in 6.0 and 150 
     top is fast enough for me).  Re: the lateral acceleration, given any 
     decent suspension this is determined much more by tires than the car 
     itself.  However, some of the more smile producing aspects of handling 
     don't come through the numbers, like speed and crispness of turn in 
     and track out, or responsiveness (determined in part by horizontal 
     polar moment, which is minimized in the mid-engine configuration).  
     Minimal roll is another pleaser, besides heavy sway bars, springs and 
     shocks (which impair rough road comfort) roll is reduced with a low 
     center of gravity.  It helps to have a flat engine mounted at the very 
     bottom of the body.  The third handling pleaser for me is steering 
     precision.  In the twisties, its a downright pleasure for me to set 
     the wheel at the beginning of a turn, squeeze on the throttle through 
     the turn, and not have to keep fiddling with the wheel to stay in 
     lane, while I come out of the turn at outrageous speeds.  I don't have 
     the numbers to compare these characteristics of the Boxster with those 
     of the M3, but I suspect, in balance, the Boxster comes out ahead.  I 
     will admit that only two seats is a drawback when my SO wants, us to 
     take my Mother-in-law someplace, I guess its not only the children who 
     suffer.
     
     (Well maybe that was $.03).
     
     Thanks for the bandwidth, I feel much better NOW.
