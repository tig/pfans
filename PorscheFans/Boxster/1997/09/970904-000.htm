Andrew,

I don't know about longer tire life, but higher, and more balanced tire
pressure does help performance.  In one of the recent corvette Vs
boxster tests,  (Autoweek or Car and Driver, I forget?), the vette (with
sport suspension) was run against a stock boxster with 16" wheels. Lots
of complaints about how imprecise the boxster felt.  The Porsche guys
took the car away, and returned it the next day with the tire pressure
increased, (as I recall to 44 PSI front and back).  The impact on the
car was dramatic, with much improved handling reported and most of  the
complaints of the previous day discarded.  

I'd be interested in hearing what experience folks have had at drivers
education events with the boxster, and if they  played with the pressure
and to what effect.  I was unable to run mine at  the Rockingham event
due to height issues (me too tall, roll bar too short).

Cheers, RC
