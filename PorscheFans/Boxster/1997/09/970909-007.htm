  Will try this again since it appears that only the first sentence of my
last post was transmitted.

On Sept 6 and Sept. 7 I had the opportunity to drive my Silver/Black Boxster
as the Pace Car for the Las Vegas PCA Club Race.  What a wonderful
experience. On the track, the Boxster handled like a dream.  I never stop
being amazed at the ease in handling the Boxster. 

Incidently there was a Silver/Black Boxster which was fully race prepared.
 It is being developed as a "Arrive and Drive" race car by Kelly Moss
Motorsports of Madison, WI.  The car was very well-prepared and David Stone,
the brains behind the concept has many more interesting improvements he wants
to make to make the Boxster fully track legal for everyone. 

For you So. California Boxster owners, if you are interested in driving your
car in a Autocross, there is one in San Bernadino on Sept 20.  For more
information call Frank @ (909)592-2849..or leave me e-mail and I will be more
than happy to give you exact starting time and place.
