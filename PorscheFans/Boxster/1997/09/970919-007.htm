Oooo! Now HERE's a thread of debate I can sink my teeth into! The infamous
WHAT'S A PORSCHE FOR debate. Let's face it. The Germans have been pulling
the wool over our eyes with this 'Form Follows Function' manifesto since
before Dieter Rahms (sp?) picked up his first crayon. If form really only
followed function, Porsches would be styled by engineers, they'd be
hideously clumsy looking, and those of us who have devoted some part of our
lives to designing cars would be looking for work in the garment industry.
The fact is, people look to Porsches for many things: performance,
heritage, ergonomics, beauty, [insert your own preference here]...all of
which Porsches excel at.

Let me ask you a question  - what does color have to do with performance or
comfort? Yet anyone who claims they don't care what color their Porsche is
is a liar. Now I'll be the first to want to call out the Design Police
whenever I see a beautiful design bastardised with body kits, basket-handle
spoilers and inappropriate wheels. I believe in honoring the intent and
vision of the designer, and keeping a car as stock as possible. Still, if
it makes people feel better about their cars, what the hell? Let them look
silly to the purist elite and be happy with themselves.

Porsche has some of the best designers in the world, designers with taste
and sensitivity and a sense of restraint. How else could the Boxster have
such voluptuous forms and yet be so taught and controlled, while every
other attempt just looks over-inflated? These guys are also designing the
factory accessories, of which most are pretty nice. While I may think the
carbon-fiber trim bits look pretty gaudy, the aluminum-accented break and
shifter, in my personal (and, I suppose, professional, FWIW) opinion,
really improve the detailing of the interior and feel better in the hand
than the stock ones. What's more, I got to order my car the way I think it
looks best, and to me it's perfect!

Forgive me if I spend as much time staring at my car as I do driving it
like a madman through the winding twisties (that's what the P38 is for).
The thing that I don't understand is, what are you guys doing spending so
much of your time at purchase thinking about selling your car? Are you
going to pick the color you think will bring the best resale in five years,
or the one you'll enjoy most until then? This is like choosing a mate based
on how you'll do in the divorce settlement. For god sakes, I hope I never
have to sell my car!! This thing's going to be a classic.

-whew- thanks for the outlet, guys. We now resume our normal programming.
