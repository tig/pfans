In response to Michael D. Moore's inquiry:

L.A. is the Mecca of aftermarket goodies for the Boxster:

CEC (Claus Ettesnberger Corporation): They sport a large selection of Boxster
wheels, bodykits, suspension upgrades and are an official rep for TechArt
(the  respected German tuner).  CEC, in Century City, has a posh showroom
complete with the cleanest service bays I've ever seen!  In addition, they
 have an excellent reputation here and around the country.  Ask for Barry or
Claus (both good people) ... 1 310 203-3900 or 
1 800 766-0064

Ogner Porsche/Ferrari (Woodland Hills):  The most innovative Porsche
dealership around when it comes to Boxster stuff.  This is because of Jeff
Korda - a Porsche mechanic with a ton of experience - a brilliant designer
and problem solver and John Eschelman (the parts manager) who has a great
overview of the marketplace.  Jeff is the one who developed the boomerang
(yes, the one subject to much heated discussion), the first out of the gate
to offer modified Boxster exhausts, a Boxster hardtop stand and lift,
 colored Boxster dials, custom Boxster calipers,  Boxster aluminum racing
pedals, Speedline Boxster wheels, and has lots of Boxster items  in the
pipeline.  If you ever run into a Boxster problem you or your mechanic or the
techs in Reno can't solve... he's the guy.    1 818 884-4411 or 1 888
693-3772.


Performance Products:  Located here in the valley, this is one of the largest
Porsche mail order houses in the country.  Although their prices are
sometimes high, they offer a great selection of Porsche products and their
Boxster list is growing.  In an upcoming issue of "Motor Trend" their
modified Boxster is called one of the best handling cars ever tested!  And
yes, Michael I do believe they offer a plug-in dash light.

Gemballa:  This German tuner has it's North American headquaters in Mailbu
(that's where I'd put my headquaters too!).    In addition to Boxster wheels,
Boxster interior leather packages, and Boxster suspension kits they will be
offering a turbo for the Boxster in the near future... 1 310 - 457-1709.

Rodeo Audio:  The first time I visited they were putting in a $20,000 sound
sysem in a Ford Expedition!  But don't let that scare you off.  They have
more hands-on experience with Boxster audio upgrades than anyone else in the
U.S.  Offering several systems, I put in one that required no modifications
to my car.  You have to hear it to believe the difference. (And it did fit
within my bugdet)   Ask for Larry... 
1 818 888-5000.

Wheel Enhancement (Culver City):  Robert Wood has more  experience with
concours winning Porsches than any other wheel guy.   Period.   They now have
a big selection of Boxster aftermarket wheels.  1 310 836-8924.

North Hollywood Speedometer:  If you're thinking about changing the dials on
you Boxster, this is the place.  Forty years of Prosche service.  A great
little shop with a huge rep... 818 761-5136


I'm sure there are lots of other good aftermarket Boxster resources around.
 But with so many concentrated here in L.A.,  I don't have time to look!
