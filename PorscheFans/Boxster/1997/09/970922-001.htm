Stop the presses (and put down those wrenches).  I was able to find and
access a wiring plug without removing the battery.  There is a plastic
shield on the drivers side of the front trunk.  Remove the half dozen or
so screws that hold it in place, and then you will access to the front
of the firewall.  In the firewall you will find a rubberized wiring plug
which provides a space to into the drivers footwell above the brake
pedal.  

Now my car is an early production model, (delivered 2/97).  Is it
possible that the location of the plug has changed?
