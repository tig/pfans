I was just browsing through the Scottsdale webpage(awesome Boxsters pics.)
and noticed what could be a custom cupholder in one of the interior
pictures(http://www.scottsdalejag.com/box/bxcarbon.jpg)

There is a coke bottle on the edge of the passenger seat floor.  Does
anybody know what this is?  Is it just a coke bottle standing on its own?

I wonder what the cost for the boxsters with those interiors cost.  Does
anybody know?  They have some outrageous interiors...  Now I know why all
those uncountable Y options in the options list...
Has anybody paid $60,000 for a boxster?  I paid about $15,000 and change
just for options on my Boxster and I thought that I spent way too much but
I guess there are people out there making use of every option.

About the new BMW 7-Series;

We have a 97 BMW 740iL in our family and this is a great car indeed.
Probably one of the best handling luxury sedans out there(I have yet to
try out the new Audi A8).  Compared to any of the Benz, it handles much
sportier.  I have to admit theat they are not the best handling cars out
there in the snow but traction control seems to help a little.  I haven't
had major problems in the snow but if you want to be safe I guess I would
recommend the Audi A8 quattro.  But the BMW is definetely a winner!
