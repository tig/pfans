     My opinion for what its worth is:
     
     Manual is better, definitely. I drove both when choosing mine. If you 
     like Autos the tiptronic is definitely an improvement on the normal 
     slushmatics. Certainly miles better than the last auto I drove which 
     was a Sebring (on holiday touring the Napa valley). But that whole car 
     was rather akin to what I imagine a canal boat would handle like if 
     placed on the road :)
     
     However it is most definitely not an semi-automatic manual like 
     Ferrari's new 355 F1. Its drawbacks are the same as with a normal auto 
     - torque conversion etc. It is definitely more sluggish than the 
     manual away from a standing start (but still fast enough for most 
     purposes).
     
     Personally I did not find the way it changed gears satisfying, but I'm 
     not an auto fan. Anyone out there who bought the Tiptronic want to 
     leap to its defence....
     
     Japan Boxster Update.....
     
     Just been up to Hakone (mountainous region 100km south of Tokyo). 
     Great drive along streaming wet hairpin mountain roads, I really love 
     this car. But it was extra frustrating not being able to use full rpm 
     whilst I'm only at 600km.
     
     Highlight of the day - visit to the Porsche museum in Hakone. A 
     collection of cars on 3 floors (!) including:
     356s (Carrera 2, Speedster etc) 550 and 550a spyders.
     a 959
     911/935s (R, RS, RSR plus various nutter turbo and racing versions - 
     Kramer etc)
     various 914/6s
     prototype 944, ex le mans 924 GTR
     Lots of racers 904, 908, 917, 956, 962. Plus the Porsche F1 car (or 
     was it F2? - anyway the single seater from the 60s).
     Plus lots of memorabilia - signed overalls and the like.
     
     Just as I was about to get back into my boxster, a guy pulled off the 
     road into the car park in a Silver Merc SLK. He had a good look at my 
     car, smiled and waved and then drove off! This car definitely attracts 
     a lot of admiring attention.
     
     More stories later...
     
     Cheers
