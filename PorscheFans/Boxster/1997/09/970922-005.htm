In response to John C's < I am a little taken back that someone would buy one
of these wonderful machines and then put it at risk on a race track >,  When
we first got our Boxster, I vowed that it would never be put on a
track..After experiencing the ease of handling and the pure pleasure of
really driving the car, my mind has changed.  In fact the SO and I are trying
to figure out how we can get another one to replace the tired 914 for
time-trailing

This last week-end in San Bernardino my Boxster hit the track racing for the
first time.   This was suppose to be an autocross but was on a wonderful
track. It was wonderful.  Made me remember why I love Porsches.

I encourage everyone with a Boxster, even the cautious, to at least take it
to a driver's education and learn how to really drive the car and what it and
you can do together. Actually it will make you a much better and safer
driver.
