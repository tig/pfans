I took delivery of my car august 12th or something to that effect... the car
was completed in germany july 14th... from there theres the 2 weeks it takes to
get to PDI... and then the week or so till your dealer has it in the lot... it
takes about 3-4 weeks from time of completion to time of arival... the car
takes about 14 days to build...

your dealer should have updates on his computer as to...
a) beginning of building
b) completion of car
c) arrival in PDI
d) arrival in lot...

one thing that does bear mention is that various options that you may have on
order can hinder the completion and inevitably the arrival of your car... some
things the set back can be days... others it can be months...
also if you order tiptronic you have a harder time getting a spot on the
line... and other times the opposite is true...

just hound your dealer a bit for updated info...

also if you don't know about TOURIST DELIVERY ask your dealer.
