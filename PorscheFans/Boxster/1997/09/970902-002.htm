It's stunningly sharp humor like this that makes me dream of a moderated
mailing list.  The harley digest is run by a crotchety old fart who
would have cut off the boomerang thread long before now, and banished
for life the writer (?) of  the attached.  I join the chorus of voices
crying "enough".  Back to the car if you please.

Cheers, RC
