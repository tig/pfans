I still think the Boxster can't be compared to any of these cars.  Let's 
take them one by one:

*The 911:  I should hope that the 911 still handles better.
*The Supra:  You're trying to compare a GT to a sports car.
*The Viper:  I won't even touch that one--it's as American as you can 
get, in evey respect.
*The M3:  A wonderful sport sedan--pure and simple.  Maybe the best, 
second only to the now-defunct M5 or 190E 2.3-16.
*The 'Vette: Again, a GT car with 145 more horses.
*The NSX:  A *wonderful* Japanese appliance.
*The Ferarri:  A great car if reliability and temperment aren't important 
to you.

I everyone is missing the point.  I said it before, I'll say it again:  
Just because the magazines are trying to foist on you their opinion of 
what a sports car should be, doesn't mean you have to take it.

All the reviews that I read which properly place the Boxster in a test 
with the SLK and Z3, put the Boxster far ahead of the other two.  I would 
lose sleep over the fact that magazines don't know how to categorize the 
cars.  If price is their criterion, why not compare the Boxster to a Land 
Rover Discovery SE?
