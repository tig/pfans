Answer me this: "Where can I buy a new 986 at MSRP without delay?"

I'm currently 'helping' two friends buy their Boxsters and I myself am
agonising over a 993 (having become disillusioned with the appearance and
now the reviews of the 996.)  This means I've had the various experience of
talking with all the dealerships (with one deliberate exception, Negherbon)
in the SF Bay Area.  Each salesman said much the same thing about the
Boxster, "selling like hot cakes, 18 month waiting list, put your name on
the list and maybe pick up on a drop out."  Strangely, the sales
performance information
(http://www.infoseek.com/Content?arn=PR3908-19970903&qt=Porsche+classifieds&
lk=noframes&col=NX&svx=lhsnx) from Porsche Cars North America, Inc.
suggests that there is a dealership stock (unallocated Boxsters) to the
tune of 244 cars and the "sorry, just can't get you one even if you counted
out the cash in C notes right now" Turbo and Turbo S models are languishing
in dealerships in the number of 14 or so.

Not bad, just a few million dollars in stock that PCNA want to move, but
dealers don't want to sell.  Explanation?
