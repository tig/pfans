John Cochran asked whether anyone had a crystal ball projecting the
recoverability of Tequipment costs when it comes time to sell.
I don't have a crystal ball, but the Kelly Blue Book people
(www.kbb.com) have few opinions to offer.
Running a '94 Carrera  with 20k miles through their wholesale value
projection indicates that you will recover at least some of your
investment in 'functional' options such as CD players, premium wheels,
Tiptronic transmission (yes, it's worth about $1,500 more with the
'slushbox', according to Kelly), and the like.  
With the exception of leather interior, styling options probably won't add
anything to the resale value of the vehicle, and may in fact make the car
a little harder to sell, since personal taste comes more heavily into play. 
Paying a bunch of money for carbon fibre trim is perhaps a good
example.  It's all the styling rage today, but 5 years from now it will
probably just look dated, and the cost will not be recoverable.
