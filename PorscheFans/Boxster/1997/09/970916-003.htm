received last month my silver/red leather interior boxter; with hard

top, p38 package, upgradeded cd-stereo,headlite washers and wood pkg.



only problems so far top would get off track on closeing, spoiler has  

stuck in up position several times, and no place to fasten porche

floor mats.



extremely happy with the car; not to mention the amount of attention

received while driveing or when the 986 is parked.



paid sticker price for car no hidden charges, it took 7 months

from order placement to delivery. I have placed order for the new

improved

model whenever it comes out.



95 toyota forerunner

95 Defender 90

96 XJ12

76 harley super glide--my first harley

87 sportster

95 fat boy

96 road king

73 mustang convert.

79 triumph spitfire



have a nice day         jtb
