Welp, I've got a horror story for you:
Had a routine oil change accomplished at a Porsche dealership (on my 1988
Carrera), made it all the way home, ten miles, when the oil light came on.
That's odd, I thought.  Went back to the dip stick to find ZERO oil in the
car.
Looked under the car and oil was dripping from everywhere.
It seems they didn't tighten the drain plug, it worked loose (fell off), and
I was lucky enough to make it home.

You know what's really funny?  They expected me to pay for the replacement
drain plug!  ISYN!  

So much for slamming the five minute wonders in favor of the factory trained,
eh?
