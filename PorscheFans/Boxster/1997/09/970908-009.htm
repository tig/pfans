I think it's a matter of relative performance -- the normal ride height,
spring rates and damper settings are a marketing compromise.  Indeed the
car is reviewed to have superb manners (faint praise, really) in normal
configuration, but the real dynamics of the car are subdued in this guise.
With the stiffer and more purposefull configuration of the sport suspension
option, the car takes on a new quality with less initial movement in the
body and sharper response to the wheel.  With another fifty horses to
exercise the dynamics of the car, the Boxster could be one of the finest
cars imagineable.  I only thing I can think of is Porsche needs to attend
to the weight distribution issues.  Roll on the S.

I suppose that if you brought a late model 944 Turbo up to its peak it
would potentially be a car equal to or better than the M3, but the
potential of the Boxster surely exceeds the 944.
