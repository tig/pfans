It's a beautiful day in the Inland Northwest, and a friend just called with
a serious problem.  Seems he drove his Boxster yesterday and all was well.
Returning home he turned the car off but left the key in the ignition for a
"short while" to continue listening to a new CD.  This morning he goes out
to the garage, and the car she won't start.  He tries the radio and the
lights and they work fine, but that's it!  He then locks the car with his
key to set the alarm, then unlocks it and gets it to try again, still no go.
What to do now?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  

TIA
