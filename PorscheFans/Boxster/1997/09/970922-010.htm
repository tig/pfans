Hey Everybody!
Well, I am well past the break in period on my Arctic Silver/Boxster Red 
986, and I am LOVING it!! I've only gotten it up to 120mph so far, but 
damn is it fun to drive. And I can't believe how many looks it gets!! I 
guess I'll have to stop picking my nose while I'm driving, 'cuz everytime 
I turn my head, someone is checking out my car.

First of all, I just finished working on a music video for En Vogue that 
features a Boxster prominently in one of the setups. It is a beautiful 
Black on Black with a guy stepping out of it, and one of the women 
singing around him. I scolded the director for not putting the top down, 
and he turned to the producer and said, "Why didn't you tell me it was a 
convertible?" (!) So, keep on the lookout for "So Gone, So Long" playing 
on MTV any day now.

Secondly, I've been really keen on trying to remove the center console 
from beneath the radio. It really gets in the way of my long legs, and I 
think the picture on pg. 66/67 of the Boxster promo book looks very 
stylish without it. So, I called my local Porsche dealer (Pasadena) and 
they seemed a bit confused about it. I called Porsche, and they said that 
that picture is of a pre-production model, and that they don't offer it 
without the console. I kinda pulled it apart to take a look at it (the 
two carpet segments just pull out from each side, and the leather sides 
just pop off and then go forward) and it seems like it would be no big 
deal to fashion some sort of carpet piece that would fit in there like 
the picture in the book. So, my question is, is there someplace in the 
L.A. area that would be able to do something like this? (Without having 
to replace the whole front carpet) Is there someplace that specializes in 
Porsche interiors?

Okay, my next question is, where can I go in the L.A. area for all the 
spiffy cleaning products you guys are talking about (Lexol Leather 
Conditioner, Meguirs window cleaners, etc.)? Also, does anyone know of 
any really excellent hand-carwashes in, say, Burbank/Glendale/Pasadena 
area? (I know, I know, I'm supposed to wax it with a diaper, and all 
that, but I just don't have that kinda time these days, you know) I've 
been going to Antique Car Wash in Glendale. They are all hand washed with 
no machines or brushes ever touching the car. They do a real nice job, 
but I just thought someone might know of a REALLY great place.

Also, are ALL of the red trim pieces of the Boxster Red Leather interior 
leather? Some parts, like the dash, seem sort of thin and untextured for 
leather. Also, has anyone ordered the leather sun visors with the 
electric lights? Do they come with the god-foresaken airbag warning 
stickers plastered all over them? (I don't want to go through that Hell 
again. Mine still have a shiny glow where the old stickers were. I just 
can't seem to get the damn glue goo off!!)

Well, I guess that's it for now!
Thanks,
Chris
