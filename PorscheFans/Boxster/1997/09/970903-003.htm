Am I hearing someone volunteer to be moderator of this group?  :-)

The cool thing about un-moderated groups is that it is the poster, and
not some "crotchety old fart" who decides what gets seen and what
doesn't.  IMHO, moderated lists are an infringement upon the 1st
amendment.  The list is fully capable of policing itself through censure
and direct e-mail to those found to be overly offensive.

Then again, a moderated list might not allow itself to become a
direct-marketing arena for a product like the boomerthingy, but through
the posts of many here among us, I'm pretty sure that everyone has made
up their minds about this particular product and thus further discussion
will be unnecessary.  New inquiries may be directed to the archives.
