1.  The badge was damaged when my car was delivered.  The dealership took
it off and asked me if I liked it with or without.  I decided to leave it
off.  Makes it a real stealth car.  The philistines that don't know what it
is are perplexed.

2. Saw the posting on the heat shield.  I am getting my new engine
installed and have asked the dealer to provide the heat shield and they are
not sure what it is.  Could someone provide a part number?

3. Gotta second the opinion on CEC.  Very cool showroom and lots of good
stuff.  Barry seems to know what he is talking about when it comes to his
aftermarket offerings.

4.  Could someone clarify the Ogner guy's skills?  Is he the one who
developed the so called Porsche Extreme exhaust that uses the factory core,
but gets reworked?  If so, does Ogner sell it.  

5.  Can anyone tell me what speed the car should run at 3000 in 5th?  Would
be a good way to check the speedo.

Thanks
