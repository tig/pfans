My arena/gray Boxster was ordered without ever seeing an example in that
color combination.  I'm expecting the car in 2-3 weeks (it should be on the
boat).
This past weekend we were staying in The Sea Ranch, CA for my mother's 80th
birthday party and decided to take her to Pt Arena Lighthouse.  Just north or
Gualala I spotted an Arena red/gray Boxster parked in front of the Company
Store Cafe just off Rte 1.  I brought our rental Intrepid into the next
turnout and sped back to the Cafe.  And there it sat, top down, my next car
(almost).  My family (all three generations, my mom and my daughter) know me
so well they just took it all in stride.  I did resist going into the cafe
looking for the owner.  I was content seeing it in the pigment and being
driven (it was dust covered from use!  Yes, a real owner).
Actually, it was very ironic since I had been saying for the past three days
that this route 1 was the place to be driving our Bimmer or the soon to
arrive Boxster.  My wife was about to gag me.
So, whom ever you are, thank you.  I envy your access to route 1.  I took
great delight in having the visual preview.
