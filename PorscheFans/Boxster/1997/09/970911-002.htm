When changing my own oil, I noticed that there was a small drop of oil on the
very bottom tip of the engine.  I had never seen any oil on the floor of the
garage. Investigation revealed that it was coming from the bell housing.
 Dealer pulled the tranny and replaced the engine main seal.  Third car to
need this at this dealer. Also had a major rattle on a rough road coming from
inside the car.  The latching mechanism worked fine , but there were broken
parts inside the latch. Dealer fixed, works fine
