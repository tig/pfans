To whom it may concern:

I placed my Boxster order in July of 1993 and received the car at the end of
May, 1997!  Guards red, black leather, 5 speed, heated seats, 17" wheels,
sound package [cass. + cd chgr], leather roll bar, alarm, keyless entry,
painted crests, misc. interior trim upgrades, etc. and now have a whopping
1500 miles on the car!

Only one problem to date of any significance:  When warm, the car was
miserable to start.  It would fire right up cold, but then require 3-4-5
cranks to produce a hesitant re-start after it had been running!  I had
suspected a fuel pump/line related problem and this proved to be the
case--new dealer installed fuel pump took care of it!  They also r/r'd a
rattle from the instrument pod and realigned my headlamps and top.

To the boxster pilot who wants a factory hardtop as an afterthought:  Real
simple.   Go to your friendly neighborhood Porsche dealer with your check in
the amount of the hardtop from the equipment spec list.  98's are identical
to 97's as of this date.  They'll be glad to order one of their incoming cars
in your color w/the top, knowing the owner won't want it, passing it on to
you, and everyone's happy.  [It's what I did just 'cuz it looks cool.
 Practicality wise, it'll sit in the basement alongside my Alfa
Quadrifoglio's!]

As far as speedo/odo error, it never dawned upon me until reading some of
your concerned comments.  Another  relatively simple solution:  I went and
visisted a cop friend, and next week he'll zap me with radar and we'll
communicate each others' speed readings via handhelds.  Of course, driving
alongside a patrol car (with it's calibrated speedo) and doing the mutual
'thumbs up' at, say 10 mph increments, with the officer's cooperation, will
set your concerns aside.  But this comes at a small cost:  They'll invariably
ask to go for a spin!
