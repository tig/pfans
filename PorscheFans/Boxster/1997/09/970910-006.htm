     I actually paid more at 7500 miles.  I got charged for the 
     15000 mile service, which is what they did, not just oil 
     change.  What exactly is included, I don't know, but besides 
     the 8 (give or take) quarts of Mobil 1, the filter, I got 
     hit with 2 hours of labor at $65/hour.
     
     Not complaining, but I am thinking about how to cut the 
     costs down.  I am planning to change every 7500 miles 
     because I run the engine at high revs (many more revs/mile 
     than I would assume the market-driven 15,000 mile oil change 
     interval is contemplating), and I am doing auto-x.  My 
     thought is that the (even-if-expensive) prevention is worth 
     it.
     
     Any one else's thoughts on this??
     
     Jon

How much are people getting charged for Oil and Filter changes?  I hope 
$160 is not the standard.  Even my BMW 7-series isn't that expensive.
     
And how easy is it to change the oil/filter?
     
Could someone post a "how to change the oil/filter in a Boxster?".  Do you 
have to be an expert mechanic to do this or is it easy enough for me to do 
this at home?
     
Thanks,
     
Alberto.
