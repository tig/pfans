Brian, Pfans,

	Thanks to Brian, and a lead to an independent installer in 
Fairfield Ct.  I learned the secret to routing cables from the radio to 
the CD changer in the front trunk.   The secret lies in removing the 
battery, behind which is a 3" round wiring plug (through which one cuts a 
hole, or an X) and then passes the cable through.  BTW it is also 
necessary to first remove the plug, and cut a hole in the padding 
underneath it (this creates a passage about 3" to the right of the brake 
pedal linkage, just above the throttle peddle).  The job took about 45 
minutes.  The CD changer works flawlessly, no hops skips or jumps, & for 
MUCH less than what the dealer wanted.

PCNA gave me some advice which I tried to follow, but was either 
misinformation, or was given to me in a way I didn't understand (I think 
the former).  If anyone needs more details, send me some bytes.
