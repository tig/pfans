A tyre came off the rim?  It's hard to say if this was a result (effect) or
cause of the spin.
I've 'tried' to spin the Boxster, at anything less than 65mph, it's nearly
impossible.
Conversely, I can hold my '94 911 in oversteer until the tyres are worn
down to the rim and it's a matter of lift off oversteer or power-on, either
way.
