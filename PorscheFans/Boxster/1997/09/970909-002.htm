I am taking European delivery in Nov.  Was no trouble for my dealer. 
But I did have another dealer tell me that Euro delivery of a Boxster
was impossible, which was a good sign for me to avoid that dealership.  
It seems each dealer gets one Euro delivery per year that is outside of
their allotments.  It is really handled differently than a normal sell,
so you need to find someone who knows how to do the paper work.

Each car delivered through the tourist delivery program is manufactured
in Zuffenhausen, so the Finland issue should not be a factor.

> possible.  Would the decision to manufacture in Finland have anything
> to do with this?
