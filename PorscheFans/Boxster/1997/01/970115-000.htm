Just thought I'd let those in the Seattle area know that Barrier Porsche
in Bellevue got their first Boxster today.  It's essentially a basic car
with no options.  Color is red.  Of course it has already been sold, but
the dealership won't let the new owner take delivery until another comes
in... so test drives are available...  appointment only.

My first impression of the car is that it is much *better* looking in
person than on paper.  From the rear quarter it has a very muscular look
and it seems much wider than it probably is.

The car sits very low to the ground.  The front valance doesn't have much
more than 3 inches of clearance.  The overall shape is quite nice.

Engine sounds at idle or revving in neutral are very 911ish sounding in
the exhaust note.  The new owner, having just returned from his test
drive, reported that it sounded great in the upper rev band, and that
normal conversation was no problem on the road.

Interior head room is surprisingly large.  I'm over six feet and there =
was
lots of headroom left.  The leather steering wheel was a bit of a
disappointment... looked and felt more like vinyl.

Operation of the top was slick and very fast.  However, there is one flaw
in the design that would drive me nuts, at least in the 40 degree weather
we had today.  When the top folds, so does the rear window, right down =
the
middle.  The top was in the folded position for no more than 15 minutes,
yet when it was put up again, the rear window had a nice big "crumple" in
it... which is directly dead center in the rear view mirror.  This car
really needs a folding glass window... or maybe it will be fine in normal
temperatures.  Anyway, the operation was fast and neat.

I have to say I like this car a lot.  I guess I should make an =
appointment
to drive one, even though I'm not in the market.  Should be fun!  With =
the
optional 17" wheels and bigger rubber it would look fantastic.
