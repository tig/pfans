Hey guys,

Went to the Vancouver Pacific Auto Show last night to see the new Boxster.
I really hope that Porsche one day wakes up and cancels MCL's Porsche
franchise.  They did the most pathetic job of displaying the car;  the
car actually did not look very nice.  It wasn't the car's fault, it
was the people that displayed it.  The car firstly was black, the hardest
color to show the wicked lines of this car, second, the car was literally
crammed into a corner, and thirdly, THE TOP WAS UP.  Why would any
convertible car be displayed with the top up?  I think even worse than
all of that was the ya-hoo that was standing by the car answering questions,
there were actually two there, one was good, the other wouldn't know a Porsche
from a Corvette.

Speaking of Corvette, they had this horrible Corvette display there with
people singing live, it was a nightmare.

Anyhow, I'll have to wait for a red, silver or yellow one to really 
appreciate the car and hopefully with the top down this time.

Farzaan.
