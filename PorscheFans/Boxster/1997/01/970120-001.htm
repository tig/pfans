Regarding your note of the broad markings on the Boxster speedo, it also has
a digital speedo (standard) which reads in 1 mph increments.  Just my .02
after driving one.

For what it's worth, I wouldn't sweat the "first run quality" issue.  What
about the quality on a Gmund 356?  Wouldn't mind having on of those!

One last comment, after test driving Boxster.  The car doesn't have a
dipstick!  The dipstick is an electronic dipstick on the instrument panel.
 It has graduated readings of the "dipstick" and even a timer to tell how
long you need to wait for an accurate reading.  (That was the only thing I
didn't like on the car.  It seemed a bit "Japaneseesque").  No offense
intended to Japanese car enthusiasts.
