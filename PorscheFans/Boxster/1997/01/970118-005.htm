Hi Jim. There are a couple of things that may affect your questions. The hardtop has a rear 
window defroster built in, that plugs info a socket on the car.  It may not be in a car, not built with the 
option. The windblock changes the way the space is configured behind the seats (shelf replaces 
luggage net), so there may be more to the windblock than meets the eye.

I have a Boxster ordered for March production, so obviously I'm not worried about build quality. 
Afterall, aren't they being built on the same line as the 993s?

From what I've heard, you want to look at the car before taking a 'no frills' version. Tell the dealer, 
yes, but make it conditional on seeing it first?   ;-)
