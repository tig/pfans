And you trust idiot gauges??? wow, maybe I have been driving eye-talian cars
for too long :-}

Regarding recommended oils, can you say marketing? I am certain Mobil paid
dearly for those stickers on the Turbos. Why do you think they kept using
those "state of the art" P7 tires well into the 80's? 

When I lived in D-land, the exclusive oil recommended for 911s was Shell
TMO, stickers everywhere; but interestingly enough, I got a list of approved
oil brands for their flugzeug motor and it included just about every major
brand on it.

I think any oil that meet their recommended SAE standard is legally OK,
warranty wise; it would be hard for anyone to convince me not to use Mobil-1
from the price/performance standpoint.

Semi-synthetics are lame, because you have no idea what the mixture is, it
is not necessary 50/50, and considering how difficult it is to change the
oil in that Boxster, I'd want the thing to have the longest lasting oil
possible. The savings on oil is not going to enhance your children's
inheritance that much, I say, let them suffer :-)
