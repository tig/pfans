I felt similarly about the sport suspension when I bought my 993 a few 
years ago, and European Car endorsed it by saying "honest, you don't need 
it with this great suspension" (or something quite similar).  I loved the 
way the car handled.  It was my 7th 911 over 25 years and far and away the 
best handling.  And then my wife bought a 993.  Sport suspension, sport 
seats, etc. (both cars are '95s w/ 17" wheels).  Now I'm sorry I didn't 
decide otherwise.  Her car is noticably better.  A bit firmer, yes.  But 
there's no denying that it performs better and the suspension upgrade is 
well worth the extra cost.  I prefer her sport seats too (over my plush 
leather, fully electric ones).  Much better support and fit (for my body 
anyway).  We don't race either car, but do drive spiritedly.  This 
comparison is obviously not about Boxsters, but I suspect there is a good 
parallel.

Re 17" wheels: get them.  Bad option to scrimp over.  Forget the stereo.  
Pot hole damage?  That's a new one.  8^)   BTW, 17" wheels won't 
necessarily be better on the track.  Most 911's are better at autocrossing 
with 15" wheels (due to gearing and the ability to run at higher RPM and a 
lower gear for autoX speeds).  Width is more of a factor.

I'd pass on the ABD unless you will be driving a lot on slippery surfaces.  
A LSD would be nice, though.

Certainly, Boxsters will be more than welcome at PCA events!
