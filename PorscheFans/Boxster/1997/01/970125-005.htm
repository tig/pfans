The (standard) CR-31 cassette unit in my Boxster is made by Becker.
The little case that the removable front fits in says "Becker" on it.
Since the styling of the CDR-21 in-dash CD is identical, it must be
Becker as well.  I don't know anything about the cd-changer.

I don't have the Audio upgrade with the door woofers.  The stock
speakers are just in the dash and seem a bit weak, especially on bass.
But, as I mentioned in my previous message, the cockpit is loud enough
to make me not want to spend a lot on a stereo anyway.  I do like the
feature where the stereo gets lounds and softer automatically
depending on the ambient noise in the cockpit.

As to whether aftermarket car audio can be done well, the answer is
yes.  Go to a reputable outfit that has done Porsches before and you
shouldn't have a problem (except with your wallet).

Good luck,
