From following PCNA's postings on the Boxster I flew down to L. A. this
weekend to see the car, at long last!  First, Boxsters should be arriving as
soon as today at dealers' showrooms. It seems several red/black models are on
the way. Due to vandalism of the cars by the public, the Boxsters on display
were all locked, with the tops up.  The lighting in the display area was
beautiful, but did not afford a good inspection of the interior.  The texture
of the leatherette used on the dash for the standard interiors has a
"stippled" appearance-perhaps like a football or basketball-
and the photos of the Boxster Red leather interiors don't do it justice!  As
a result, I think I will opt for the leather interior.  The antenna pictured
in the press literature is apparently for cellular telephone-the radio
antenna is in the windshield.  All Boxsters have two small openings in the
nose for installing license plates, but it seems there is a provision to plug
them with caps painted body color. I was not able to view a car with the
trunk mounted CD changer so its anyone's guess just yet how it's mounted.
All the cars looked great but I must say the Zenith Blue Metallic is
wonderful!  The wheel options available include the now familiar
"technology"-style wheel well as a 16-inch wheel that looks like a 5-pointed
star with twin spokes at each point-I was told these would be available
standard.  Hope this is accurate info and useful to others.
