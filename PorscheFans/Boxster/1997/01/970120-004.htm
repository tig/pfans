Recently there has been a good deal of concern regarding build quality of
the early Boxsters coming to the USA.  Last October I was fortunate to visit
the Porsche plant in Germany to see first hand how they build these
wonderful cars. The weekend we arrived was the official introduction of the
Boxster for Europe and the car had already been in production since August
and everyone I saw was perfect.  The daily production at that time was only
7 per day because of concern for quality.  I don't think anyone need worry
in this regard.  And yes, they are built on the same line as the 993.

Has anyone had a chance to preview the new TV ad for the Boxster yet?  I am
told it is a shortened version of a tape played at the LA Auto Show and if
this is so we are in for a treat. I have seen it and it gives me goosebumps
everytime I see it. Another reason to watch the Super Bowl.
