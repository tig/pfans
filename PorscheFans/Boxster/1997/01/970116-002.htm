Just dought I'd let dose in de Seattle area know dat Barria' Po'sche in
Bellevue gots deir fust Boxsta' today. Slap mah fro!  It's essentially
some basic car wid no opshuns.  Colo' be red.  Of course it gots'ta
already been sold,  but de dealership won't let da damn new owna'  snatch
delivery until anoda'  comes in. 'S coo', bruh... so's test rolls are
available. What it is, Mama!..   appointment only. Slap mah fro!

My fust impression uh de wheels is dat it be much *better* peepin' in
sucka' dan on sheet.  From de rear quarta' it gots'ta some very muscular
peep and it seems much wida' dan it probably is.

De wheels sits real low t'de ground.  De front valance duzn't gots' much
mo'e dan 3 inches uh clearance. What it is, Mama!  De overall shape be
quite supa' fine.

Engine sounds at idle o' revvin' in neutral are real 911ish soundin' in =
de
'eshaust note. What it is, Mama!  De new owner, havin' plum returned  fum
his test roll, repo'ted dat it sounded great in de uppuh' rev band, and
dat no'mal conversashun wuz no problem on de road.

Interio' 'haid room be surprisin'ly large. What it is, Mama!  I'm ova' =
six
feet and dere wuz lots uh 'haidroom left.  De leada' steerin' wheel wuz
some bit uh a disappointment... peeped and felt mo'e likes vinyl.

Opuh'shun uh de top wuz slick and real fast.  However, dere be one flaw =
in
de design dat would roll me nuts, at least in de 40 degree weader we had
today. Slap mah fro!  When de top folds, so's duz de rear window,  right
waaay down de middle. What it is, Mama!  De top wuz in de folded posishun
fo' no mo'e  dan 15 minutes, yet when it wuz put down again, de rear
window had some supa' fine big-ass  "crumple" in it... which be directly
wasted centa' in de rear view mirro'.  Dis car really needs some foldin'
glass window... o' maybe it gots'ta be fine in  no'mal tempuh'tures.
Anyway, de opuh'shun wuz fast and neat.

I gots'ta say ah' likes dis wheels a lot.  ah' guess ah' should make an
appointment to roll one, even dough I'm not in de market.  Should be fun!
Wid de opshunal 17" wheels and bigga' rubba' it would peep fantastic.
