Who knows?  Seriously, I don't think past poor price performance on 924s,
944s, or 928s, is an indication of how the Boxster will fare.  I think =
the
introduction of the new 911 (996) will help the Boxster because it will
have a very similar engine, i.e., a water pumper.  Eventually, the "911
crowd" may actually see that there are some benefits to water cooling.

The resale value will be determined in the marketplace.  If lots of =
people
start selling their Boxsters soon, the value will fall.  If not many are
for sale, they will hold their value.  It's just supply and demand.

Probably, just like in the computer world.  The thinking here is about =
the
same too.  You can wait forever until the model of your dreams comes out,
or you can buy one that you like today.  Those that wait may get a nicer
car (faster)... but they also don't get to drive a Boxster now.

Maybe.  It depends on your confidence in the factory.  If you think they
can iron out production problems quickly, and I'm sure there will be =
some,
then it is probably not much of an issue.  If you think they will be like
VW's first years of production at their Mexican plants, which were
horrible, then you might be concerned.  Since the Boxster is being built
along 993s (from what I've heard), I wouldn't be overly concerned, but I
wouldn't ignore it either.

I don't think you can judge the production quality by the look of the =
demo
cars at the dealer showrooms today.  I'm sure Porsche did everything they
could to make darn sure these cars look perfect.

>All input gratefully appreciated. This is just something to occupy
>my mind while I await my Boxster.

While you are waiting you can think of all the other fine cars you could
buy for this amount of money... an '89 944 Turbo PLUS a new '97 GTI =
VR6...
a '92 NSX, a 928 GTS AND a cruise around the world... the list goes on.

I'm sure the new Boxster will be a fine car.  For a new Porsche, it is
reasonably priced.  That doesn't make it inexpensive.  It is still a huge
amount of money for most people.

Have fun with yours!
