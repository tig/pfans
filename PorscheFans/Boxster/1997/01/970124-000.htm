Byron,

Thank you for the note.

<< 
 Geez, I forgot...
 
 I got a call from the fella' that sold me my 944S2 this morning.  He has 
 a brand new Boxster in stock, which the deal fell through on.  (The 
 potential owner decided he wanted yellow instead of red, so he 
 re-ordered.)  It's a base car, Guards Red, black top and interior, 
 $39980 + freight total $40,745.  
 
 The dealership is Autowerks in Love's Park Illinois, just northwest of 
 Chicago.  The salesman's name is John Ray 1-800-747-2880.  Speaking from 
 experience, you can trust John enough to make a deal over the phone.  
 He'll even pick you up at the bus station if you like (I took a bus from 
 Chicago Midway to Love's Park.)

I think this one made it to the Boxster mailing list already!

I think it's one of the base cars that each dealer gets, I'm surprised
they don't keep it for a demo. They will sell it fast!

My sponsor Danbury Porsche had a Boxster introduction champagne
party tonight and Matt Murray came up to drool too (got his 968 serviced
too). The boxster looks better in person, can fit almost anyone
well. One problem could be the tecnic sport option comes with
traction control that is probably not defeatable... does anyone
know if this is a problem in autocrossing (maybe same as 993)?
