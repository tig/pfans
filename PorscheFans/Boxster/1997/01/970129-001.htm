I hate to admit this publicly, but maybe someone will get a laugh-

I bought a new BMW 325i in May of '95. I ordered one w/the sports pkg
-bigger wheels,tires, stiffer springs, after driving the std one. When it
came in, it was so rough riding, I cringed whenever I hit a bump. I checked
tire inflation, etc. and just kicked myself for not driving one first.
After a couple thousand miles (incl road trip to 356 registry holiday in
ohio) I heard a noise in rear. Took it in to the dealer, where they removed
the SPRING SPACERS! They left the damn shipping spacers in that prevented
90% of the spring from compressing. Rides great now; MUCH better than a
stock 325i.

TWO dealers missed this - Athens, Georgia and Columbia, SC. And BMW NA
didn't really give a rats ass that I was upset.

But I'm not bitter. :)
