Does anyone know if the windblock can be added to a car that didn't
originally come with it?  How about the hardtop?

The reason I ask is that my dealer called today and offered me the
first Boxster that they received.  It is guards red and has no
options.  I was seventh in line, but no one on the list above me wants
a red car with no options.

Should I be worried about build quality a car from the first
production run?

I went down and took a look at it.  It was very nice.  I think the
styling works very well.  The car looks very good in Guards Red and
the leatherette interior is very good looking.  This leatherette looks
better than the leather in some lesser cars. My only complaints about
the car are the dead spots on the center console that look like
switches but aren't and the fact that the small speedometer has very
sparse markings: 25mph, 50, 75, 100...  These are pretty minor
complaints.  I didn't drive the car.

Another question: When I was looking at the option list, I noticed
that the Technic option package includes the ABD traction control, 17"
wheels and a stiffer suspension for $1901.  Later, I realized that I
wasn't sure whether it actually included ABD and the wheels or whether
it required that you purchase them as well.  The wheels alone are
$1450 and the ABD is $847.

Thanks for any input.
