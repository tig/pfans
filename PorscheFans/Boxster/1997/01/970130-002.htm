  Hi Bill!
       I have an order in for a Boxster which is expected sometime in late
  spring/early summer (perfect time for a break-in road trip). My wife and
  I are going to be brave and get it in Pastel Yellow with black interior
  and top (hey, the yellow is a classic 356 color...). I have raced in SCCA
  showroom stock C for 4 years and have owned several sports cars (some
  from new). I'll use that experience to try and answer your questions.
       1. "Lugging" isn't determined so much by the engine RPM but rather
  by the gear you are in AND the RPM. So 1500 RPM in 1st is OK, 1500 RPM in
  4th is not. The car will sound bad and run rough. It may even stall.
  "Lugging" is bad on the engine (crankshaft, etc.) and the transmission.

       2. 4200 does sound low but if that's what the factory says... I
  would amend that to say you should not exceed 4200 regularly during the
  first 1000 miles. An occasional burst is OK but I would try and stay away
  from redline. Notice I said "occasional". Don't run the thing at 6500 RPM
  for 2 hours. Vary your road speed and engine speed during the 1000 miles.
  Yes, Porsche does run the engine hard mainly to get an initial seating
  and to ensure that it runs well at all speeds. It is not a wear-in
  running. They leave that fun task to us for the 1st 1000 miles... :) One
  other thing that I do after the first 1000 miles or so is an oil change
  and differential/gearbox oil change. This way any metal shavings that are
  dislodged during the break-in period will not remain in the engine and
  transmission to do any harm. I use Valvoline synthetic engine oil and
  Redline gear oils. Remember that you are breaking-in the transmission as
  well as the engine.

       3. The only thing I can think of that they might be talking about is
  MTBE. It is an additive to fuel in high-pollution areas. We have it here
  in Denver from November through March. This is the "oxygenated fuels" you
  may have read about. We also have ethanol which I run and have had no
  problems with. Of course you're not supposed to have problems with MTBE
  either but last year the percentage was raised to 15% which I feel can
  clog fuel injectors. In fact BMW used to use the stuff for testing its
  injectors to see when they would clog. Anyway I think that the ethanol
  blends are better. Does anyone else out there have other experiences?  Is
  this what Porsche is talking about with the MMT? Or am I just full of
  it?...

       4. I haven't heard this one, at least as it pertains to car engines.
  Maybe horses...break 'em in fast and they will retain that wild spark and
  be fast runners too? I don't know. I'd follow #2. I would break in the
  engine quickly in a few days on a 1000-plus mile trip just so that I
  could enjoy the higher RPMs and road speed without having to wait months
  for it. But not because it would mean that the car will be faster than
  every other Boxster. That's what chips and intakes and exhausts are for.
  :).

  See ya!

  Bob.
