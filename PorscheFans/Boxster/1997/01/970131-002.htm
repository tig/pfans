Jim Dempsey asks 

>>However, the dealer
was adamant that no service was necessary on the Boxster until 15K and
I was starting to believe them.

>>What is the general concensus?  Change oils in new cars at 1K or wait
until factory recommended 15K?  (The car comes with Mobil-1 synthetic
in the engine.)

Oil changing is the cheapest engine insurance you can buy. Oil is cheap. The
15K (or other high mileage) number is something done by many manufacturers
partly to claim how low-maintenance their car is. It is also reflected in
those consumer buying guides and the like where they calculate cost of
ownership based on scheduled maintenance. If the manufacturer schedules no
maintenance, the car runs for free, right? Like the famous 100,000 mile
tuneup from Cadillac, BMW, and who knows who else. ("Well, it's 100,000
miles, you need spark plugs, wires, and by the way, a cylinder head job...")
