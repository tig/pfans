My Boxster doesn't have ABD, doesn't have 17" wheels and doesn't have
sport suspension.

In driving on everyday streets, I find the grip tenacious and the
suspension surprisingly firm.  I've convinced myself that I wouldn't
want the sport suspension (which I haven't driven) because it must be
too punishing and I wouldn't want the 17" wheels because (A) the 16"
wheels have plenty of grip and (B) the 17" wheels (with their
40-series rear tires) are likely to be more easily damaged in Boston
area potholes.

Now, you can say to yourself "he's convinced himself he doesn't need
this because he doesn't have it" and you may be partly correct, but I
am extremely happy with the handling characteristics of my Boxster the
way it is.

I don't have anything to say about ABD except it might be good on
slippery roads and possibly on the track.  I probably would have
ordered it if I had infinite money.

Now if I were going on the track, 17" wheels would be the ticket.  But
perhaps you want a separate set of wheels for the track.

Will Boxsters be welcome at PCA club track events?
