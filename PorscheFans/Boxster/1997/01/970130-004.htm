  Yeah, I'm sure the dealer is just repeating what was told to him, and
  maybe, just maybe Porsche knows what it is talking about...:) If they run
  the engine at the factory and then replace the oil, I MIGHT be able to
  overlook the 1,000 mile change. But never would I let it run to 15,000
  miles. I would definitely change the gearbox at 1,000 miles. Besides, I
  want Redline in my transmission. Really good stuff. As far as Mobil 1
  goes I'm sorry to hear that they are using that C**P at the factory. I
  will never touch the stuff again. I had an engine that needed a valve job
  because the oil turned to glue and gummed up the valves. Now granted that
  was under racing conditions but still... The oil was changed every second
  race or so. I have never had any problem with Valvoline. I think the
  faster I can get that Mobil 1 out of my Boxster and replace it with
  Valvoline the better. Also a note on dealers. They should not be
  considered as the final authority on a car. Maybe Porsche dealers are
  better but still... I keep remembering the problem that I had in the
  mid-80's when a certain car that I had (which will remain nameless due to
  my own embarassment)  which wore larger tires in the back was brought
  into the dealer for service. When I came in to pick the car up the dealer
  had rotated the larger tires to the front!!! This was on a mid-engined
  car with rear-wheel drive!!! So anyway when working with a dealer, just
  be wary of what they say. In fact once my Boxster is out of warranty I
  will more than likely take it to a reputable private garage. This is a
  formula that I have used for more than 10 years that seems to really
  work.


  Bob.
