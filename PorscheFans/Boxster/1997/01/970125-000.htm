I picked up my Boxster on Friday.  So far, I'm very impressed.

I've never owned a rear or mid engined car before, so the handling is
very different for me.  It is very quick to turn in and easy to
control.  It feels strange when I hit a bump in (even a low speed turn)
and I feel the weight in the rear -- I'm going to have to get used to
that.

I haven't gone past 4200rpm (as the manual recommends during break-in)
so I don't have much to say about quickness, except that it feels adequate.

It is a little louder inside at highway speeds than I thought it would
be, but oh, what a sound!  The engine sounds magical just behind your
head.  Good thing I didn't spend those extra bucks on a real stereo
system.   (I wouldn't mind a CD player though -- anyone have a CDR-21
for sale trade?)

It looks absolutely great.  One of my favorite views is of the rear
fenders as seen through the rear view mirrors.  Very sensous curves!
It is a little embarrasing driving a car that everyone stares at,
though.  Perhaps that will change as they become more common.

There was one problem when I picked up the car.  Of the three keys
that came with the car, one of them wouldn't start the car.  It turned
the ignition and the dash lights came on, but it wouldn't start.  It
turns out that there is a transponder in the key that talks to the
car.  If an "unauthorized" key with the wrong "signature" is used, the
car won't start.  There is a procedure to authorize new keys (or to
disable stolen ones).  Unfortunately, the dealer couldn't figure out
how to do it!

Does anyone know where you can get floor mats for the Boxster?  I sent


automotion email, but they didn't respond about whether they are
available yet.  How about custom car covers?

My wife said I didn't seem very excited.  Boy was she wrong!
