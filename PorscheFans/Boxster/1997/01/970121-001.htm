The first Boxster has arrived in Calgary. It's a silver/black partial leather, with a seemingly packed 
option list.

From a styling standpoint, I think the nose is much better looking in real than the photos, much 
narrower. The rear of the car looks heavier, below the bumper line. 

From the front and back the hardtop looks good (The car was waiting to be washed when I saw it, 
in a narrow wash bay) on the car. Adding/removing the hardtop was easy for 2 people. One note 
for 'tall' people. There is more room with the hardtop the the soft. I'm guessing that somebody 
6'3-6'4 would still fit, but hey, who's going to use the softtop?

I couldn't drive it (there is solid ice on the road, and it is snowing), but it sounded nice inside when 
you 'blip' the throttle!

May 97 986/P38 anticipated now, more than ever!
