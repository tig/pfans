To order or not to order...

Does anyone have any details on the hi-fi sound package (option #490) for
the Boxster? My dealer hasn't gotten any specs on it besides 'I think it's
the one they use in Mercedes', and for lack of info I ordered my car
without it. I'm having second thoughts though, as images pass through my
head of some guy working for minimum wage pulling off my dashboard and
cutting holes in the door to install something aftermarket, not to mention
'test driving' (flashback to Ferris Bueller's Day Off) to see if it sounds
good at speed.

The impression I got was that it adds two Bass reflex speakers in the doors
and a four-channel amp. Since it's a prerequisite for the 6-CD changer I
suspect that it also might add pre-wiring to the trunk (?) (which if
compatible with other maker's CD changers, would be ideal, since Porsche's,
at $815, seems exceedingly expensive.)

The questions are:

(1) Who makes it? I've heard everything from Alpine to Clarion to Becker(?)
("Don't worry, whatever it is, it's German, they make the best!")

(2) Any stats (wattage output? Signal-to-noise ratio? Speakers - paper
cones or polypropylene? etc..) for comparison.

(3) Whether it will indeed allow me to put in a CD changer myself without
having anyone tear up my car to do it, or having to replace the
cassette/receiver as well.

Also if anyone has experience with having a stereo system put in
aftermarket, perhaps you can alay my fears or tell me what to look out for.

Thanks, Phil.
