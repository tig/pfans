These first cars were specc'ed by Porsche, not PCNA nor the dealers, for
first delivery to the US dealership market.  They are all essentially
the same, i.e., basic red Boxster, very few if any options, and plain
jane interiors.  Porsche AG would prefer that dealers utilize these cars
as viewing cars and not for sale until late February/early March, when
volume builds.

Also, no X or Y optioned cars are being accepted for build at this time,
and the Savannah beige interior is on indefinite hold for ordering due
to glare problems that PCNA is addressing through legal channels.

Finally, regarding the plastic window...having been at the Boxster
Premiere in Scottsdale and driving and viewing the cars which had been
there and driven for the last several weeks, I noticed not a single car
who exhibited a problem with the plastic window.  It will be fine.
