All -

Carlsen Porsche-Audi in Palo Alto, California had a very nice unveiling of
the new Boxster on Thursday night.  Very well put together and well
attended by many of those with orders at Carlsen including the very first
order from 1993.  His car is expected to be delivered this coming week. 
Plenty of great food was continuously available as well as Boxster sales
brochures and boutique items.  People from PCNA were also present as well
as most of the dealerships staff, all dressed in black tuxedo's.  Well
done. 

Carlsen had three Boxsters on display.  One outside (it was dry that
evening) and two inside in the showroom.  All three cars were silver
metallic ($700 extra) and one of the inside cars had the hard top ($2200
extra).  The hard top car also had the red (muted anyway) interior while
the other two were black.  One of the cars had all leather while the
others had the partial leather treatment.  One of the cars was tiptronic. 
Prices ranged from $44K to $50K for the hard top with full leather. 

The car definetly looks better in person than any picture.  The lone tail 
pipe out the back brings back some early exhaust memories and the front 
intakes don't look that bad unless you look at them from an askew angle.

I asked about the side intake vent and why they were moved up so high.  
Seems early cars had problems with sucking in the wrong ingrediants; the 
drivers side is for air to the intake system while the passenger side is 
used for cooling the enigne.  Most of the bottom of the car is open for 
easy access up on a hoist.  A compartment located behind the drivers seat 
allows fan belt replacement, but most work will be done from below.

I also found out the workings of the rear extendable tail.  Seems the 
tail goes up at about 70-75 mph and retracts at about 50mph.  Isn't this 
gonna be a big giveaway for the police to spot and see that you had been 
over the speed limit unless you are on I-5 or somewhere else that allow 
over 70mph?  I like the idea on the previous 911's that allows the user 
to manually raise and lower the tail to avoid this confusion.  There is 
no manual control on this car.

There is plenty of room inside the car and the storage space is 
gracious.  Most necessary filling areas and battery are easily located and 
accessible.  The bottom half of the dash lights remain lit for a few 
minutes after you turn the key off (I didn't time them for how long).  
Guess they want to remind you how long and how far you have been driving 
when you get out!

I understand 18 inch wheels will not be available for this car.  Something
about overheating the brakes and Porsche has already sent out a memo to
various tire companies about this problem to preclude them from plans on
making 18 inch tires necessary for this car.  Maybe somebody out there can
elaborate further on this subject. 

From a few conversations I had with various people, it seems that the 
tiptronic might be the way to go.  Seems that 20% of production will be 
tiptronic and if you want a Boxster, ordering the tiptronic might get you 
moved ahead of a few others in line for a manual since they should be 
more readily available.

Again, excellent presentation/display by Carlsen and beautiful car by 
Porsche.
