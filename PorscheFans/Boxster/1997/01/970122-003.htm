My dealer got it's first Boxster, (not mine I'm later on the list). This guy
ordered his car in 1994! It is black on black. The exterior black looks good,
I thought the interior was grey but the sales guy says it's black. It's
really a charcoal color. The car has the "sports pkg". They wouldn't let me
drive it but, the tech who prepped it said the car really pulls from 2800 rpm
to 5500 rpm and handles great.
I'm 6'4" and with the top up the headroom is pretty good, like a 944. The
steering wheel seems a bit large and low (it does telescope but not much),
detracting from my legroom but I don't think it will be a problem-it's alot
like the room in my 944S2. Everything else is just like the magazine
pictures.
Hope mine gets here soon!
