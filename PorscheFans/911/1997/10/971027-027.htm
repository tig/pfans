Dear Fans,

I did it!  After several false starts in the past few years when I allowed my
brain to overule my heart I finally took delivery of an 81SC a couple of weeks
ago.  My thanks to Porschefans for showing me all the things to look for,
allowing me to use some of them as weapons to beat the dealer into whimpering
submission!

I love the car...no I mean I LOVE the car.  Yes the synchros need a little
work and no it doesn't have 4wd or ABS, but when the sweat bark of that engine
around 4000rpm hits my ears and the car takes off in a manner that screams
only PORSCHE!! I have to slap myself to take the grin off my face.

Just a quick question though.  I saw a thread on the list about engines idling
fast but didn't see a definitive answer.  My car when it warms up idles at
1100-1200, sometimes a little more.  Blipping the engine makes no difference. 
From cold I normally get 5-10 minutes of normal idle at 900 before it creeps
up.

I'm about to put it into my mechanic for a service but would like to know what
the problem is so I don't sound too innocent (read gullible).

Thanks again Porschefans.

Vaughan Woods

911 81 SC (and still grinning!)
