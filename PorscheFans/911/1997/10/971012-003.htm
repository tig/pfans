Dan:
I have not heard nor seen that claim; and certainly hope that it is not
valid;
But, I don't have the answer.

I can say, however, that I have just installed a superchip from
Superchips Inc. in my 88' 911 Carerra and have been very pleased with
the results so far.

Add to this a B&B Tri-Free-Flow exhaust, a Billet adjustable fuel
regulator and a K&N cone filter as you have done; and you're in
business.

'88 911 Carerra
You'll have a new experience from an already lively car.

Subject: Superchip

I had a Superchip installed in my 88 911 when I bought the car recently.
 Since then, I've had someone tell me that high performance chips should
be avoided as they compromise engine life.  Specifically, I was told
that driving the car at around 100mph for 20 minutes would overheat the
heads and burn up piston/valves etc...

While I don't often run 100mph for 20 minutes at a time (or at least not
I admit to it publicly ;-)) my concern is what does that mean if you
drive at 80mph for 40 minutes....  I recently drove it on the (back)
road at speeds such as we are discussing and engine temp gauge was right
where I expected although I have been told oil temp is not a good
indicator of head temp.

So, what can you experienced Pfans tell me about this topic?  Safe or
not?  I still have the original chip and would rather have that put back
in instead of sacrificing engine life.  Car has 93K miles and is
otherwise in excellent mechanical condition.  Only other mod is a KN
filter, all rest is stock.

Thanks to all.
