Hello Porsceh Fans-

I am considering replacing the driver seat in my 1983 911SC. Currently I
have the standard seats that came with the car, and they just do not get
the job done on the track, HOWEVER they are very confortable on the long
haul. I would like to buy only ONE race seat, and just swap it from side to
side as I need it. Let me explain, I live in Vermont, but will be doing
driver ed events all over the north east, and many of the tracks are a good
distance from home. My thinking was to have the stock seat on the drivers
side for the long drive, then I arive at the track, I put the stock seat on
the passenger side, and put the race seat on the driver side, that way I
have the best of both worlds.

My question, is Will this be allowed? The rules say equal "restraints" for
driver and passenger, and I read that to mean equal belts. am I mistaken?
Will I be given a hard time by the organizers? Just trying to keep my costs
down is all. I plan of course to put full 6 point harnesses on both sides,
but if I can save $600 by buying one less seat, THAT would be very nice.

Thanks for your time.
