Hello Pfans -

Does anybody have experience with the QuickRack steering
rack that Automotion has in their catalog - it says it reduces
steering rotation, AND effort, which seems to go against my
knowledge of gear geometry - 

If you replace a smaller gear with a larger one, for a higher
gear-ratio change, you have to increase the torque required
to turn this larger gear..., no?

Anyway, that aside, has anyone used this rack?  I have an 
'89 3.2, and my steering effort is very high, much higher than
my buddies 77 911...  I experienced some drop in effort when
I got my new dunlop dm40's (even though they were one size
wider than my old goodyears!)

Since I was planning on rebuilding the rack, I'm considering this
one instead - why spend $200, when you can get more-fun for $1000 -
do we all have this idiotic mentality?!?

I also am planning on replacing my ball joints, and maybe the
a-arm bushings - I have this annoying squeak in the left side
front suspension when I go over bumps, and it may be related?

As usual, any advice or comments are fully appreciated...
