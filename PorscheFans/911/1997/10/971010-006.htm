Collyer:

There are two problems with mounting a camcorder; both relate to the 
fact that you don't have a rollcage in your car.

First, the camcorder's tripod mount is pretty feeble... While it'll 
hold the camera forever if your car remains stationary, it'll have a 
hard time restraining the camera in the unlikely event that you crash 
into something solid during one of those driver's-ed events.  You 
have a cabriolet, so a flying camcorder may also pose a hazard to 
other cars on the track.

Rollcages generally provide a more-secure mount (usually with a 
redundant restraint strap or something, too) that's more-or-less 
guaranteed to keep the camcorder from flying around or out of your 
car in the event of a crash.

Second, even if the camera DOES stay in place, it may pose a hazard 
to you in a crash or a spin... Camcorders have hard, sharp edges, and 
you don't want to bang your head or arm against them.  Again, a 
rollcage could help here, since it might allow you to mount the thing 
far enough away from the driver's seat that you wouldn't have to 
worry about hitting it.

I don't know how you could securely mount a camera in a stock 911, 
especially if -- as I assume from the fact that you don't have a cage 
-- you want to do it in a completely-reversible way that doesn't 
require drilling holes in your car.  Whatever you do, though, 
please keep the above two points in mind.
