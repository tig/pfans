Bob,

We have been powder coating 911 fans for many years without any
difficulties. This is an attractive alternative to the stock fan and
have done them in red, white, gold, yellow, blue, etc. They seem to hold
up very well over time.
I have tried epoxy painting the fans (with 2 part epoxy paint) but the
leading edge of the fan eventually wears through the paint and distracts
the good looks you have created.
While powdercoating the fan housing is acceptable, it is not necessary
to go to the added expense. Generally we paint those as well as the
engine sheetmetal with a high quality enamel paint with the hardner
added. Ditzler makes some good enamels that hold up to the wear and tear
on the engine compartment.
Regards,
Terry
