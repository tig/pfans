Just to add to the "which gas is best" chaos...

I've taken some auto-mechanics classes in the past at a local community
college.  My teacher, who loved to tell stories (most of them were
believeable!), told us about his brother, who drove a Texaco fuel truck.  One
night, while visiting his brother, my teacher went along with his brother on
his fuel-delivery route.

He said their first stop was the "fuel depot".  My teacher thought, "OK, we're
going to the Texaco depot," but his brother just kept referring to it as THE
depot.  When they got there, and pulled in, there were Exxon, Chevron, BP, etc.
trucks all filling up, out of the same tank!

My teacher's brother explained that all the gas in a particular locality came
from the same place.  They each just had a bucket o' "stuff" that they dumped
into their trucks after filling up at the depot.  The "stuff" was supposedly
mostly coloring, plus a few additives.

He went on to explain that the "discount" gas places, whose prices are always
10 or 20 cents less than the name brands, fill up there too.  Only, they wait
until the depot's tanks are nearly empty.  The gas at the bottom has a greater
chance of having contaminates and water from leakage into the tanks.  Thus, the
depot sells it cheaper, and the discount gas stations can pass on the
savings...

Anyway, like I said, it's just a story, and I don't know how true it is.  But,
it IS interesting...
