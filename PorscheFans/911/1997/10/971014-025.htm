> I think my timing chain is going on my '68 911T, facing the engine,
> the left hand side is making a noise sounding like a chain rattling. I
> don't know what type of timing chain is in the car, this has also led
> to a noise which sounds like it is coming form the carbs but good be
> further back in the engine a slight tapping noise. The car is in
> general making a whining noise almost as if something is rubbing, the
> noise changes when the clutch is depressed. The car drives OK (I had
> to get home) I kept the revs low but it was not misfiring and the
> power still seemed to be there. 
> 
> Does any one have any ideas before I take it to the shop? I want to
> ask a few intelligent questions when I go. If it is the timing chain
> is this the bit that should be replaced by the carrera tensioners? How
> should the shop go about looking for the fault, is this one of these
> cases where the partially strip the engine and then tell me what is
> wrong, if I fix it there, no problem otherwise they charge to put the
> engine back to together?
