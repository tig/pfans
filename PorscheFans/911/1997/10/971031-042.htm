Hopefully the group can help me solve this starting problem. ( Car is an
86 911) Several days ago, I hopped into my car and turned the key.  I
got only a "click".  I tried several times, and got more clicks.  Then,
a faint turn of the engine, more like a little growl. Then clicks, and I
almost walked away, searching for a jumper battery.  Tried once more, a
little longer turn of the engine.  Next try, it fired up.  Drove it
home, and parked in garage, turned it off, and then restarted
perfectly.  Problem was there again the next morning.  After starting on
eighth try, I drove to see my mechanic.  He agreed to do a quick check,
and found the battery (which is only 3 mos old) was in great shape, at
about 14+ volts, and seemed to stay same at 3-4000 revs.

Car is now in garage, and will not start normally, but I am sure will if
I am patient.  My garage gave me a device to plug into the back of the
ignition switch, and I can plug it in when the problem occurs, and see
if I can isolate this to the switch.  I will try this in the am if
problem returns.

Next steps include tracing all wiring for a short, and checking critical
connections such as as the starter which is probably the culprit.

Any suggestions from the group?  I'd like to do the starter myself if
possible, but hate to spend the time and $ if I cannot definitively
isolate that as the probem.  As I am working on it over the weekend,
please send replies directly, plus post to board.

Thanks
