I didn't get much feedback regarding the magnetic replacement for ignition 
points sold by Automotion.  Since points problems contributed to my being left by the side of the road recently, I hoped I could find a modern fix.
I ordered the Petronix ignitor from Automotion, but when it came the instructions were not written for my application -- l975 911S, which has
a Permatune CD box.  I asked my local P-wrench to install it, figuring he'd know how.  Long story; bottom line is that Automotion ended up sending three units, none of which worked!  I got to pay for 1.25 hours of shop time for each attempted installation.  :(   

The customer service guy at Automotion said they actually  get more
returns on the Allison-Crane pointless ignition procuct that they sell.

Guess I'll have to learn how to live with the points.  Sure wish somebody made a modern-type distributor that would just bolt in!  Anybody have any ideas?  I mean besides buying a newer car!
