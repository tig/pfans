Well, it sounds like you managed to get a really good deal.  When I
bought my '72 911T, I wound up having to put a couple thousand into it
right off the bat to make sure everything was up to snuff (it hadn't been
driven in a while, and the FI system still isn't what it should be).  
I think that the average experience of someone buying a '66-'73 911 does
include some initial repairs.  The cars are 25-30 years old and usually
you can find a couple of things that need work, and Porsche parts aren't
cheap.  

Having said that, the other reason I recommened a non-S model is that the
S models seem to go for somewhere between $2000 and $6000 more than the
non-S models.
