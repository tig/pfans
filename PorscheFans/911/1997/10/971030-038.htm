I have been rather curious about seeing the same fuel distribution company's 
trucks (Kenan) at various different brands of Big Name gas stations. So I have 
recently asked the drivers of several fuel delivery tankers about gasoline 
quality/differences. I have now been told three different times by different 
drivers that the fuel itself is the same, that it often even comes form the 
same tanks (?!?), but that it is only fuel's additives make all the 
difference. 
Apparently Chevron is definitely the most concerned about the precise 
proportion of their additive products to their gas. Amoco comes in second, and 
most of the rest of the companies don't seem to care much at all... Also, for 
the record, the mid grade variety is simply a mix of premium and regular, and 
the mix is often not too carefully done, the truck drivers say. Just thought 
y'all might want to know, as we are all Enquiring Minds, right? This data 
casually gathered in the Southeast. I am interested as my car gags on anything 
with less than 92 Octane.     Warren.
