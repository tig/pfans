Folks,
 
>>      The brake pedal remained firm the entire weekend
>>      which is very nice.  However, braking hard was uncomfortable.  The car
>>      has street tires on it which may have contributed to this.  But, when
>>      braking hard, I couldn't feel the car tip much nor could I feel the
>>      car get a firm grip on the road.  It was as if when braking the car
>>      had less grip than other times.  Strange.

One caution: BFGs are so very stiff that chalk/shoe-polish techniques
can be considered nearly useless.  The tires will simply not roll over
very much, no matter how much air you let out.  Not disputing that
you found a better pressure.
