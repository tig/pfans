This is a resend of a message sent on 10/16/97. I apologize for the
taking the bandwidth but the 10/16 archive did not make the general
list...

Over the last 10 months of reading and collecting articles from this
e-mail list, I have developed a crude (and I do mean crude) PERL program
that can sort messages into different subject files.  I've tried it on
the last 10 months of archives with some success but there are issues
with this type of access:

1. Ten months of archive is a bunch of text.  I keep the original
archives in a compressed lzh archive and it still consumes 5+Mbytes of
space! The expanded text is about 14Mbytes. Currently, this PERL program
creates one html index of all the subjects found in the archive and
hot-links each subject to the file of related notes.  Even with my
mighty 133 MHz pentium it takes minutes to load this rather large html
index.  I doubt this index is practical for a web site.

2. As a e-mail list group, we do a pretty good job of keeping the
subject field the same when responding to a topic.  However, there are
several subjects where the subject field meanders in messages and the
PERL program looses discussion continuity.  For example, someone sends a
message with the subject "'83 idle problem" and someone else responds
with "idle problem" or "'83 idle".  It is minor but it is beyond this
PERL script to relate the responses to the original message.

While the messages are sorted, the program can remove topics like "GPR
LOST MY.." and "Mid-Ohio...". This does save some space.  It is nice to
be able to do a keyword search in the index and jump to thread of one or
more notes about that subject.  I'm open to suggestions on how to share
this information with everyone. Ideas?
