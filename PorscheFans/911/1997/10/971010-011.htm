Hi,

Recently, I posted asking questions about things to look for in an '87 Carrera,
and that I was in the market for such a car...  Thank you all for your advice
and input!

Anyway, yesterday I was finally able to get in touch with a guy selling an '87
Carrera Coupe.  Found out he had decided to sell it on consignment, and it was
at a local high-end European used-car dealer.  Of course, the dealer had to up
the price a couple thousand (in order to make a profit off of the consignment),
but the owner had given them my name, and they said they would still honor the
EXCELLENT asking price that the owner had given me.

So, I went to check it out.  I was a little leary, since the owner had
described the color as "mauve".  But as soon as I saw it, it was like, "Wow,
That's a beautiful car!"  (Even a friend, who went with me, and had said he'd
make fun of me for driving a "pink Porsche" ate his words, and said, "I was
wrong.  That's a beautiful car!")  Cosmetically, the car seems to be almost
perfect, with the only flaw being the plastic "knob" on the A/C fan switch
broken off.  (No biggie.)

The test drive.  It ran great -- no valve chatter, and no smoke, so no INITIAL
signs that the valve guides were worn.  My 5-minute test drive quickly turned
into a 30-minute trip, until I popped back into reality, and remembered, "Hey,
this isn't my car!  I HAVE to take it back!"

As great as it was, two things bothered me about this car.  I have never driven
an '87.  (Have driven an '83, an '84, and an '86.)  I had decided I wanted an
'87 b/c of the updated transmission and clutch.  I assumed it would be much
easier to shift than the earlier cars.  But in fact, this car was a little
HARDER to shift than the '86 that I test-drove a month ago.  My friend had a
few minutes to scan through the service records -- the car had a new clutch at
55k miles (currently has 67k miles).  ...Could this be a sign of transmission
trouble?  Any ideas?

Secondly, the car was much harder to steer than the '86 I drove last month.  I
know these cars don't have power steering - I know it takes a little effort to
drive them (& a little effort is certainly rewarded!).  But the steering was
really "heavy".  It also seemed to pull to the right, more so than just from
the crown of the road.  Possibly needs an alignment?  ...I noticed all 4 tires
(all were Dunlop D40 M2 - fronts were 205/55-16 I think) were getting really
worn -- could this have something to do with the "pulling"?  (On my current car
- VW Jetta VR6 - I had a set of Dunlops which, when they got really worn, made
the car feel totally out of alignment.  A new set of tires solved that!)

Again, I appreciate your time!

BTW:  Anybody know the "official" name of the mauve color that was offered in
'87?
