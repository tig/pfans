Todd:

There are a couple of other potential downsides:

    1.  As I understand your idea, you're putting 1/4"-thick washers
        (essentially) between the floor and the seat rails.  If
        that's true, you may be weakening the seat-mounting system,
        since the seat will be supported only on those small-diameter
        washers and the rails won't be bearing against the floor
        along their entire length.

    2.  Additionally, any large (i.e., crash-induced) decelerative
        forces will be acting through a moment arm (albiet a small
        1/4"-long one) that will tend to TWIST the seat up off the
        floor.  This is probably a non-issue, but it IS a different
        force than that for which the seat-rail/floor interface 
        was probably designed.

    3.  You not only lose 1/4" of headroom, you also move a
        couple-hundred pounds or so up 1/4".  Again, not a big
        issue; if you wanted a car that was affected by tiny changes
        in its center-of-gravity, you'd have bought a single-seat
        racer or something.

All in all, it sounds like a good idea... Just make sure that the
sub straps are protected from abrasion against the seat rails.
