airbox

To Derick Behrends:  I notice you got your answer about the year of your
car--it's a '75, the year of the Silver Anniversary Edition.  I
think--*think*--there were 400 made--at least that's the figure that
sticks in my mind.  The "Driving In Its Purest Form, 1949-1974" sticker
that you have was indeed standard equipment on the '75 911--it was
mounted on the right rear quarter window.

An acquaintance with a concours '75 Carrera paid $75 at a swapmeet for a
replacement for that sticker!!!  Mine had been deteriorating for quite a
while, and just for drill I called Stoddard--they *had it*, long after
Automotion and Tweeks had dropped it.  It's repro'd by a company called
NLA--how convenient.  I bought a couple at what was a ridiculously cheap
price by comparison--under 5 bucks I'm sure.  I used one on my car and
am keeping the other for a spare.

Steve Gilbert

P.S.  I don't know for sure, but I might be the only lister who's the
original owner of a '75 (with--knock wood--original paint, but numerous
upgrades inside and underneath).  I've been through it all with the
supposedly dreaded 2.7 and it's still a good car--albeit with total
rebuild, new case, faster engine fan, and a few other things I daren't
mention.  And I don't look or act that old :).

Subject: Rear Seat Pad

Fans,

How does the 911's rear seat attach to the car?  I've pulled one of the
pads up and it would appear that it is just glued down? ... This couldn't
be Porsche's style, I would figure that they would at least have the need
to use some sort of mechanical fastener for the seat pad?

Subject: ignition timing

I still have the question about ignition timing.  My experience with
experimenting with ignition timing prompted me to ask the question.  In
the past I have had some success in improving high end response (and
side benefit - fuel economy) with over advancing the timing.  The
downside was a slight loss on the low end and less tolerance to lower
octane fuel. What I did in the past was to advance to the point where I
started to experience detonation and then back off the timing.  Since my
car is Euro it has a higher compression, so it would seem to be more
susceptible to detonation.  Is there a problem with cylinder head
temperature with more advance?  

What is the problem with over-advance before I start to experiment?

Thanks,
Alan

Subject: heater blower

Last year someone posted information on an alternative source for the
engine compartment heater blower.  Mine, 83SC, makes a horific racket
when running and seems to have about a half inch of end play.  The
discussion mentioned other blower motors adapted to the housing.  80K
miles is not much longevity for a heater blower.

Thanks,

The URL for the German magazine Autobild article changed to an archive. 
Its new URL is:

997%2f09%2f36.

The PCNA site (http://www.porsche-usa.com/home.html) also has a lot of
information on the 996.

Subject: Carrera Intake Whistle

Mystery Solved !!

In March, I solicited the P-phans help in resolving a whistle in my intake
system that occured when the throttle was just opened a little. The whistle
seemed to appear right after I installed a K & N Air filter. A few others
commented that they had the same condition, but it didn't seem too serious.

After reading the recent discussion about K & N filters, I decided to put the
stock filter back in, and save the K & N for track use. When I opened up the
air box, the were 3 bolts resting at the bottom of the box!!  The airbox had
come loose from the fuel injection intake mating surface - the resulting
joint leakage was the source of the whistle.

There isn't much danger of the engine swallowing the bolts, but I'll
certainly check them at filter change time in the future.
