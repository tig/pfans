I'm pretty sure the 911T came with 185/70-15s on 6x15" rims.  I'm running
225/50-15s on 7x15" BBS rims on my '72T.  I have no problems in front and
occasional rubbing in the rear when I go over a bump.  I don't have as
much camber in the rear of the car as I'd like and my mechanic thinks
that would take care of most of the rubbing.  As far as I know, the 7x15"
rims I am using have the standard 911 offset, not the magical mystical
911R offset.  I sincerely doubt you're going to be able to get an 8" rim
under the stock fender, even with the fender lip rolled.  Since you're
planning on autocrossing, you should see what your local rules specify
about increasing wheel sizes beyond stock (and what they define as
stock).  Otherwise, you may find yourself classed with cars that much
more seriously modified and prepared than you may be ready for right now.

As for swaybars, again you should check the rules to see what is allowed
in the class you're interested in.  I have a Charlie bar in the back
(1 3/4"??) and it does wonders for eliminating understeer.
