    Interesting, Dave...  I'm willing to believe that explanation,
    especially now that Bruce Anderson has shot down my "maybe it's
    the straight-cut transmission gears" idea by patiently explaining
    to me that the GT1 doesn't HAVE straight-cut gears.

    Sigh... I HATE being wrong about something so easily researched.
