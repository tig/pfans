I've been happy with Pagid Orange on my '86. The rears
lasted the equivalent of 14 Driver Ed events and
the fronts still have some to go. I have heard of
people having a problem with pad material being deposited 
on the rotors but I haven't experienced this.
They stop well on the street and don't make a lot of 
dust or noise.

I agree, they do look cool. However, for safety 
reasons, non-factory drilled rotors are not allowed for 
Driver Ed events in some Regions (see below). 
BTW: I think you'll find it difficult to do an "occasional" 
Driver's Ed event - they're _very_ addictive. <g>

[Excerpt from something Stan wrote on Porschephiles]
"But here's the other half: for real racing applications, you use 
rotors with holes cast into the rotors. If you drill the rotors you
break the crystalline structure of the metal and induce stress risers; 
if you cast the holes in, you get the lighter rotors, same cooling
function, and all that jazz.  So if you are in the racing biz, you
probably already know this, if you aren't you don't need the holed
rotors anyway. Needless to say, the drilled rotors are unsafe,
will *break* and can hurt you as a result."
