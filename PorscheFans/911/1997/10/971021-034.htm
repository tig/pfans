I noticed some discussion here recently about a new spark plug in 
Eurpose.  I ran across this while browsing this weekend at this web 
page: http://www.rallying.co.uk/manufact/bosc0001.htm. Below are the 
words, and there are some graphs at that web page. Also, after 
this, is the response from Bosch US when asked if they are bringing 
them to the US.

Bosch Super Four Spark Plugs are the result of revolutionary new 
technology from Bosch - Europes largest spark plug manufacturer.

Producing spark plugs with the performance of Bosch Super Four has
been achieved through significant research and development. Bosch
Super Four will improve the performance of your car in a way totally
unmatched by any conventional spark plug.

Before bringing this plug onto the market place extensive tests were
carried out on the Super Four to compare its performance to that of
conventional spark plugs.

Bosch Super Four is 60 percent more efficient than conventional spark
plugs, which equates to a better spark and enhanced engine
performance.

Bosch Super Four provides a significant increase in acceleration
compared with conventional spark plugs, equivalent to an extra safety
margin of 13.5 metres at 70 mph.

Bosch Super Four cold start performance is 200 percent better than
conventional plugs, which makes it far more reliable in all weather
conditions.

Bosch Super Four ignition performance is 200 percent better than
conventional plugs, which means your engine runs more smoothly and
ensures the catalytic converter is better protected

I wrote to Bosch to ask if they are bringing them to the US, and got 
this response:

Hello Bill:

Thanks for contacting Bosch.

Bosch Super 4 spark plugs are not currently marketed in the US, and
there are no plans to market them in the future.  Should you visit a
country that does market them, the equivalent is W56.

Regards,
Robert Bosch Corp.
USA

Oh well......
