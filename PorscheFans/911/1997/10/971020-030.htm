I asked this list(s) and did lots of Usenet research on my recent tire search
and got lots of useful feedback.  I have an '87 Carrera with (factory upgraded)
stock 16" wheels (6" front, 7" rear) with 205/55-16 and 225/50-16 tire sizes.

In the end, I picked the Firestone Firehawk SZ50.  The closest contender was
the Dunlop D40M2, highly recommended by many Porsche owners but with a few
question marks brought up, including handling in wet conditions and simply old
technology (15 years?).  The Dunlops are definitely less expensive and based on
the responses would qualify for the best price/perf ratio available.

The SZ50 initial impressions are: they are *astounding* tires.  Caveats apply:
I have relatively limited experience with Pcar tires.  The previous ones on the
car were Michelin XGT-Z's and I must say overall those were not very good for
either handling or comfort and from the PO's records, quite expensive as well. 
I have no experience with any other tire on a 911.  Therefore I can't compare
among reasonably equivalent Pcar candidates such as the Dunlop SP8000 which
also comes highly recommended and virtually the same price as the Firestone.

Differences I noticed immediately from the XGT-Z:

	- significantly less steering effort (which got me worried:
	why is there less traction, I wondered????)

	- on my typical commute drive :-) I am going about 10% faster
	around turns with, so far, not a squeal, meaning there is
	headroom to go.  Not sure I feel like finding the limits on
	my commute, but will need to sign up for a drivers' ed event ASAP.

	- a *much* more precise steering feel

	- overall more accurate feedback -- less "busy-ness" of feedback

	- numerous alignment "problems" I had been wondering how to fix
	disappeared (slight pull; "floating" feeling); I had achieved
	essentially a perfect corner balance, toe, camber and was wondering
	what I had missed (??)

These aren't subtle differences, they are striking, like driving an entirely
different 911 from before.

Anyway, I cast a big "yes" vote in the SZ50 camp.

The SZ50 is a relatively new tire, maybe about a year old?  It is apparently
(?) designed by the designer of the Bridgestone S-02 (Bridgestone owns
Firestone), uses most or all of the same rubber compounds, made in the same
factory, etc.  The people who related hands-on experience with the SZ50 were
Mustang and Corvette owners (why no imports?) and were 100% exuberantly
positive in their impressions of the tire in a track use context, much more so
than I've seen with any other tire.  This more than any other factor led me to
pick the SZ50.  Of the roughly 10 people I heard from with direct experience,
there wasn't a single negative.  The negatives I did get were general reactions
to Firestone ("never seen a good Firestone", typically) but who hadn't heard
about the SZ50 specifically.
