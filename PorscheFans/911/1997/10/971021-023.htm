The pinging makes it seem like a lean condition.  If the O2 sensor is a
disconnected "open circuit" or the controller fails, you will probably end
up "too lean" since the frequency valve really has the ability only to
enrichen the mixture, by lowering the control pressure slightly on the CIS
system, so the CIS is actually mechanically set lean by default and is
enrichened up to the point of stochiometric by the controller.

Here are a couple of steps to take:
1.  Check the voltage coming from the O2 sensor with a voltmeter while
running. It should be 200-700mV.  
2.  Make sure that your control system is actually working by listening for
the buzzing frequency valve in the engine compartment. ( after the car has
been running and is normal temp, turn it off, then turn the key to ON
without actually cranking it ).
3.  If the controller is not working, it could be a fuse, wire, or the box
itself, which is under the seat.
Good Luck!
