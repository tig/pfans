I went  away for a couple of months and came back to found out my
battery had died.  When I finally got  it started I found a little patch
of oil lying on the rear right end of the car.

Sent the car to the mechanic and was charged close to $400 for a battery
replacement & to repair a "R & R Power Steer Pump Drive and repalce cam
seal and power steering belt.

So, I would like to find out if

1.  Is $100  reasonable for a battery change. If there is any battery I
should be getting cause mine was an original  PORSCHE battery -  I never
got this back. And if there was a some sort of trade in I can get with
it.

2.  If the Power Steering leak was a common problem with the car.  (C2
1992 Coupe)

Appreciate any views that you folks can share..

Happy Halloween !!!
