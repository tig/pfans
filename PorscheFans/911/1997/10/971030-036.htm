This is very timely because I just have had the experience of putting
unleaded (aka regular or standard) in my '79 911 SC 3.0 litre for the
first time.

It happened because my fuel gauge broke - probably over the past 2-3
days.

I always put SUPER in my car because it goes better ("the salesman told
me") but with the fuel gauge problem I got home yesterday and pulled up
at the front gate, got out to open it, heard a buzzing noise from the
front of the car, didn't relate that to a fuel pump sucking air, drove
the car to it's usual spot under the house, switched off.

Then, later, I went to go out and the car wouldn't start.  

In a flash I put it together and used some unleaded I usually put in my
4-stroke lawn mower (about one litre, if that) and drove like a maniac
down to the local BP (about 1.5 kms or i mile away) and put SUPER in.

No probs at all.  No more buzzing from the front either.

Does anyone know why the fuel gauge would be "stuck" on just a little
above empty - say, about 50 kms (30 miles) before the red low fuel
warning light would come on.  Could it just be a fuse?  I'll get on my
knees on the weekend and take a look at the fuse.
