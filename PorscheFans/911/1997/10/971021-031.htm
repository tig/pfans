I'm considering painting the Porsche crest on the center caps on my
(black) Fuchs alloy wheels. Any tips on methods/materials? Any
experience with durability?

My 10 year old daughter Emily wanted a role in the restoration of my 1970
911T.  I gave her the job of painting the center caps.  We purchase a fine
camel-hair brush from the art supply store.  I prepared the caps by sanding
them under running water with 600 grit wet sandpaper.  This removed the
oxide layer and minor scratches.

We matched colors using the hood badge as a guide.  The art store had a
good selection of paint rated for outdoor exposure.  I am not sure of the
paint chemistry, but it is some sort of laquer.  Getting red, black, and
gold paint matching the hood seal was no problem.  She did a beautiful job
duplicating the hood badge on the center crest.  Small hands and good motor
control are needed here.  We did spend some time scraping off excess paint,
and touching up here and there.  In the end, the horse, and the laurels
were sharp and clear, almost as good as the hood badge on close inspection.
 From any distance, they look perfect.

I finished the job by lightly sanding the surface with 1000 grit wet
sandpaper under running water.  This leaves a near-polished surface.  I
then sprayed MinWax Polyurethane Clear Spar Varnish, which ACE hardware
carries.  I have had very good luck using this product to clearcoat
Mercedes wheels after repainting.  Protects the wheels, is quite durable,
and sheds brake dust very easily.  Overall result is excellent.  I will
need to refinish the wheels now to match.

Would I have done this myself just to dress up the car?  I doubt it.  You
can buy hand-painted center caps from Automotion and others.  Now that I
have done it once, I found it was quite easy to get good results.  How long
did it take?  I expected to keep Emily busy for days.  She had done all 5
caps very nicely is about one hour!
