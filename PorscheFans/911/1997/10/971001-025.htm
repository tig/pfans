Joe wrote about wanting to install a MOMO wheel - here's my experince:

My wheel (83 911 SC) broke at one of the welds so I was faced with getting
a
new Porsche  wheel or something aftermarket.  I liked the looks and prices
of the MOMO wheels and decided on the "Sport" which has a small flat
section at the bottom and thus gives you a tiny bit more leg clearance.

You do need the MOMO hub/adapter.  It will space the wheel about 1/2 inch
closer to you than stock, which I happen to like because it gives your
hands more clearance from the dash and stalks.  I can still use the stalks
without taking my hands off of the wheel.

The MOMO is thicker which feels better to me and the diameter is about an
inch smaller which gives you a little different feel.  One drawback is that
this means the view of the speedo is partially blocked by the wheel.

Installation was simple, just unbolt/remove the old wheel and bolt on the
new adapter and wheel, then reconnect the horn wire.  Instructions were
minimal but it was really easy to figure out.

Price was $159 for wheel and adapter (on sale) a couple of months
ago from www.speedsiteusa.com.  It looks like they have the MOMO
"Monte Carlo" on sale this month for $159...
