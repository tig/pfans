It stands for the Taurus Super High Output model. First built in '89, it
is a 220hp DOHC 3.0 24 valve V6 built by Yamaha. '89 thru '92 only had a
5-speed, an auto trans was added in '93-'95. In '96, with the change in
the Taurus body, the engine became a 3.4 V8, with heads by Yamaha, in an
auto trans only. 
The enthusiasts are mainly involved with the '89-'95. There is a national
Registry, plus local club events and a national Convention held annually.
As the cars get older, many more people are modifying both the engines
and suspensions, as the car is a decent handling automobile in stock
form. The 220 HP motor is good for 140 mph from the factory.

For those of us who need a decent-sized 4-door sedan while we save our
pennies for a 540i 6-speed, it fits the bill well. My wife drives a Del
Sol and with the 911, we need at least one vehicle with room for 4
adults. I have owned mine since new, I have 152K miles on it, and it
still runs great while getting 28-29 mpg @ 80 mph on the highway.
