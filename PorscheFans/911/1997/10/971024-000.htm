Hello P-fans

Winter is arriving in Sweden and the period of Porsche driving is sadly
fading out. Porsche life is not over though, now comes the time of 
maintenance (about 6 months long).

I have two questions regarding this winters updates that I hope you are able to
answer.

First: I have two Weber IDT's that I plan to install. They have been updated
according to Bruce Anderson's advice in the Performance Handbook and
reconditioned with new
parts. I know that some Webers have a strange idle circuits. Do the IDT
carburetors have this.
If they do, how do I correct it?

Second: I am planning to update the suspension on my 911. 
Up front I plan to replace the torsion-bars with coil-over springs. Does anyone
know the equivalent spring rates for coil-overs compared to the 19, 21 and 22
mm front torsion bars? I noticed in Exellence that the front spring rate (coil
over) for the Jaegermeister RSR was 250 lbs. Is it a
fair guess that this would be like using 22 mm torsion bars?

Apart from this I will remove the engine and gearbox and do the usual check and
clean treat to the car.

Any information on the subjects would be appreciated. Since I have problems
receiving the list, mailing directly to me may be the best?

Best Regards Bjorn,     Porsche 911-77 & 944-82
