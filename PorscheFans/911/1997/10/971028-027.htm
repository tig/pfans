Warren,

As Porschefans is an International list, one might equally argue that
the colonial spelling is the incorrect one.

Let's not degenerate into spelling flames, please.

My owner's manual ('90 C2) specifies t{i,y}re pressures of 36/44 front/rear.
This sounded pretty high to me but I was assured it's correct. I haven't yet
tracked the car and haven't had it long enough to check for much wear, but
the rears were 50% gone when I got the car and wear is dead even. I'm
satisfied so far!

Cheers,

Ross
