I just installed a Blaupunkt Toronto in my 86 911 Targa.  It fits great and was
an easy installation, except for one thing.  I want to use the fader in the cd
player and not the factory fade control in the center console.  I would use the
factory fade control except that the speakers I have are 4 ohm and the Blau
wants 8 ohm if you are hooking more than 2 speakers to the front or rear
outputs (speaker level; I'm using the built in 35x4 amp for now).  So I need to
get access to the wires connected to the factory fade control in the center
console.

I've removed the four black screws and have taken the back part off, but
underneath that was another black plastic cover, which doesn't appear to have
any screws.  Is there any easy way to get access to the wiring for the center
console?

Thanks in advance.  I don't have the workshop manuals and the Haynes doesn't
show anything about the console...so any advice would be appreciated.
