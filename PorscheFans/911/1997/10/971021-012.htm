Hi all,

I posted a couple of weeks ago, about an '87 Carrera I was thinking about
buying.  Turns out it had been wrecked, plus, it doesn't track straight.  With
you guys' advice, I realized the weld-lines in the engine bay indicated an
accident more severe than a parking-lot mishap.  So, I walked away, somewhat
put off by the owner's and seller's lack of willingness to be completely open
with me.

This past weekend, I had a test drive in a different car (another '87 coupe).
 Drove several hours to the guy's place of business (an individual selling the
car, not a dealer).  It was a totally different experience - this guy was a
true enthusiast, a lover of Porsches, who was getting ready to part with his
baby, a Lagoon-Green '87 Carrera.  I gave it the visual once-over, as he was
telling me about how he got the car (he's a wholesaler, who bought it at an
auction).  Been his daily driver for 4 years.  Before, he had a '73(?) of the
same color...  Before I even noticed, he pointed out where the front fender and
door had been painted (like that when he got it), but there were no weld lines.
 In his honesty, he pointed out that it may have been in an accident, because
the windshield-washer-reservoir leaked, which may have been a result of it.  I
asked him if there was anything else wrong with it, and he pointed out that it
needed a new clutch, and an A/C hose had a leak, so the A/C wouldn't stay
charged more than a couple of days, and the hood-shocks would no longer hold
the hood up.  He even pointed out every little ding or chip in the paint!

The test drive - the whole time, he was talking about how to shift like a
gentleman, how to steer in the turns, how to adjust valves, how to avoid the
cops, ...  When he let me drive it, he congratulated me on "proper" shifting,
and prodded me to keep speeding up, until we had more than doubled the speed
limit on I-95, and I began to get a little nervous.

The car tracked straight and true, with only a slight wobble in the steering
wheel (tires need balancing?) at speeds above 80mph.  This car felt MUCH more
powerful than the last one I looked at (further evidence that the last one had
some demons...).  Plus, it had the sport-seats, which is a must-have, now that
I've sat in them.

The car was great!  Only 48k miles.  The price was reasonable, but still just a
tad more than I can spend right now.  (Especially since it needs a new clutch.)
 We parted with me saying that he may hear back from me.  He said, "If I do,
then great;  if not, then we had some great Porsche conversation!"

Sorry for the bandwith - I just wanted to let everyone know my faith in the
integrity and love of a TRUE Porsche-owner for his/her car is restored!  THIS
is the kinda of person that I want to buy from!  Someone who knows every nuance
of the car, does his own maintenance, etc...  You could tell, just by the tone
in this guy's voice, that he loved this car.  (Oh, BTW:  The original owner of
the car was from Pennsylvania, and the records showed that he had taken
delivery of the car straight from the factory in Stuttgart.  ...The current
owner is originally from Holland, I believe, and had the car there for 2 years.
 Said he regularly drove on the autobahn...)

Thanks for listening!

Dave

BTW:  Speaking of price:  Am I way off-base?  I'm looking for an '87 (or maybe
'86) Carrera (coupe), fairly low miles (80k or less), in good repair, to be my
daily driver for the next year or so.  Unfortunately, I'm limited to a price of
about $21k.  Is this unreasonable?  I see a fair number of cars in this price
range, but so far, most of them have substantial defects, or need a few costly
repairs initially. ...Options I want or 16" Fuchs, and hopefully sport seats.
 Beyond that, I don't care.  (I'd actually prefer NOT having a sunroof, for the
extra headroom...)
