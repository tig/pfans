All your top gasoline producers include detergents in their gasoline. Techron
is purely marketing like SU2000 was for Shell some years back. I don't know
where the legislation sits now but for a long time any gas station could and
would be able to buy gas from any supplier. You could pull into a Shell and
actually be pumping gas produced by Chevron. My only recommendations are as
follows:

1. Don't buy gas from a station that has just had it's tanks filled up
because there are contaminates collecting in the underground storage tanks
that get stirred up. My local stations all seem to refill on Sunday so I try
to schedule my gas purchases Tuesday to Friday.

2. Only buy Premium.

3. Only buy from quality stations (this is obviously subjective but there are
those stations that do not take sufficient care of their pumps and tanks and
are therefore more susceptible to having water and contaminates in their
tanks. Of course here in CA most stations have new tanks better technology
systems and tanks installed now).
