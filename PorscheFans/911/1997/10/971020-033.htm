    I am sure that this question has been asked many times, but will someone
please tell me the names of various books that discuss the 1987-1996 911's.
I am particularly interested in information that will help me in educating
myself so that I am aware of all problems that these various cars have.
Books that inform the reader of such problems as bad valve guides in 3.2
models and defective flywheels and gaskets  in C2/C4 models are examples of
problems that I would like the books to have.  I  have yet to find a book on
911's that mentions anything from the C2/C4 to the present in great detail
as to repair problems.  Any recommendations would be quite helpful.  Thank
you for your help.
