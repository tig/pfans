To Derick Behrends:  I notice you got your answer about the year of your
car--it's a '75, the year of the Silver Anniversary Edition.  I
think--*think*--there were 400 made--at least that's the figure that
sticks in my mind.  The "Driving In Its Purest Form, 1949-1974" sticker
that you have was indeed standard equipment on the '75 911--it was
mounted on the right rear quarter window.

An acquaintance with a concours '75 Carrera paid $75 at a swapmeet for a
replacement for that sticker!!!  Mine had been deteriorating for quite a
while, and just for drill I called Stoddard--they *had it*, long after
Automotion and Tweeks had dropped it.  It's repro'd by a company called
NLA--how convenient.  I bought a couple at what was a ridiculously cheap
price by comparison--under 5 bucks I'm sure.  I used one on my car and
am keeping the other for a spare.

P.S.  I don't know for sure, but I might be the only lister who's the
original owner of a '75 (with--knock wood--original paint, but numerous
upgrades inside and underneath).  I've been through it all with the
supposedly dreaded 2.7 and it's still a good car--albeit with total
rebuild, new case, faster engine fan, and a few other things I daren't
mention.  And I don't look or act that old :).
