In a message dated 97-10-22 08:51:09 EDT, you write:

<< I have a book called "Porsche 911:  Forever Young" (or something like
that) by
 Tobias Aichele.  It's been a while since I've read it, but I *think* I
remember
 reading that "SC" stood for "Standard Car".  Of course, this doesn't agree
with
 what the Porsche Customer Relations guy said (ie., that it has little
meaning).
  (But it DOES make sense - the SC was the standard car of the time!)
 
 I'll try to remember to look through the book tonight, and see if I can find
 the reference I'm talking about.  (Does anybody else have this book, and
 remember reading anything like that?)

In fact, Aichele's book indicates "These are the 911SC, whose letters are a
combination of the previous year's S, with it's "Super" equipment, and the C
representing the more powerful Carrera engine."

From the postings, it would appear Aichele is just perpetuating the
widely-held "myth" on what SC stands for.  If you read the introductory
publications of the time (1977-78), I agree with the school of thought that
it really means "nothing" unlike the 356C and 356SC (of which neither Lothar
Boschen or Jurgen Barth found the need to comment on the obvious "Super"
 engine variant of the 356C in their 1977 book "The Porsche Book, a
Definitive illustrated History")   It is just a way to distinguish the 1978
models from the previous 1977 911S without particular inference to "comfort"
or engine.

Soo...anybody's opinion is as good as the next!
