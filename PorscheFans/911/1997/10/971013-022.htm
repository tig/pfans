A couple of Pfans have asked how you get CIS injectors out.  First, they
do not screw in.  Instead, they are held into a plastic holder by a rubber
O ring which fits into a suitable groove in the injector.  This is the O ring
which can harden/shrink after long service, and needs at some point to
be replaced.  Second, injectors are removed by unscrewing the fuel line
from the injector (one wrench on injector to hold it, one wrench on the
metal nut on the end of the line to the injector.  Once that is completed,
the injector is just pulled out.  If it is baulky, some ingenuity may be called
for.

The plastic holder into which the injector is inserted is held onto the head
by staking the aluminum of the head so it can't come out.  I don't think it is
a separate part, at least one does not hear of them having to be
replaced.  While it stands to reason that if this plastic holder part feels
loose, air can sneak in around it into the intake port, which would
generally be bad, or water from the car wash might migrate in past it,
etc., my cars seem to have run just fine despite apparently loose
holders, which tells me there is something here I don't understand.

As to cleaning and testing, Dave Ferguson says he got a lot of bad stuff
out of his injectors by putting them in a cleaning solution in a small
ultrasonic cleaner before flushing them out.  I have used compressor air
to blow gasoline through, but the wisdom of vaporizing any gasoline
other than confined or about to be confined in a combustion chamber can
be doubted, and the Bosch manual cautions against doing this.  

The Bosh manual shows some sort of small hand pressure pump, which
allows one to pump cleaning fluid backwards through the injector so the
gunk is flushed back out of the screen in the injector and out the
relatively large entry hole.  The same pump, when hooked up to the
injector, can be used for checking the spray pattern.  As I recall, what
you are mainly looking for in the spray pattern is symetry of distribution,
and a distributed spray and not just a straight stream.  Plus, maybe the
pump can be used to check the opening pressure of the injectors.   

If anyone has figured out what to use as a hand pressure pump under
such cirmumstances, I bet a lot of us would like to know.  Start with a
grease gun, maybe?
