I sent this to the 993 list; thought the Porsche list might be interested, as
well.

  Bob, I have been driving 911s since 1976, accumulated a total of approx. 
  250,000 miles in them - street, track and autocrossing.  I'm not bragging,
  I am not claiming to be an expert driver, but this is what I have noted
with
  the 993 vs. my previous 911s.
  
  With the power steering, I was initially overcompensating to correct the
(very
  rare) oversteer condition I got myself into.  This led to several cases of
tail
  wiggle (fishtails?), fortunately never to the point of losing it.  I have
noticed 
  that the rear suspension seems to try to correct almost immediately;
whether
  this is due to the fancy limited slip or the suspension geometry, I don't
know.
  Generally what I do in a oversteering situation, is only turn the wheel
slightly
  (1/8 turn or so); car then will stabilize.  At the same time I apply
neutral 
  throttle (no more or less gas).  Initially, I was applying more steering
and
  overcompensating.   Haven't had a problem in approx. 10 autocrosses and 
  >10 track events since learning the car.
  
  Does your region put on any general high-speed autocrosses where you can 
  do some practicing on oversteer correction?  By "high speed", I mean well 
  up in second gear, possibly third, and open enough where if you spin
  you won't hit anything?
  
  My 2 cents, for what it's worth.

   What is the opinion out there on recovering a 911 (or more specifically a 
   993 with the new rear suspension) from a drop-throttle-induced oversteer 
   like Eliot experienced below?
   
   Last Sunday I spun on Turn 6 at Thunderhill, when I dropped the hammer too

   quickly right before the apex, overloaded the rear tires (which were 
   already operating at large slip angles at that point), got wheelspin, and 
   the tail came around.  I applied opposite lock, with neutral throttle (not

   lifting but not applying more gas either), and slid sideways into the dirt

   on the inside of the turn.  No damage, but got the car all dirty.
   
   Back at the paddock some of the guys said I should have applied even more 
   throttle when the rear started to go, in order to put more weight on the 
   rear tires and regain traction.  I don't understand this method, since it 
   was too much gas that caused the wheelspin and loss of traction in the 
   first place.  Wouldn't more gas only exacerbate the situation?
   
   I do understand that if you caused the rear to slide from lifting or 
   cornering too fast, then to you do have to apply throttle to xfer weight
to 
   the rear in order to recover.  If the rear wheels are already in wheelspin

   like above, however, how can more gas help?
   
   TIA,
   Bob
