This discussion is a great one and one that I thing I can add to. I have
a '68 Targa and am restoring it and have learned some tricks about
sealing it up.

First, if you need to replace the seals REPLACE THEM with good
originals. Don't try to fix or rig them up.

Second, after the seals are replaced or if if they are ok find out where
the leak is.
    There are two good ways to do this the first will work well if you
have a '69 or newer. make a liquid soap and water solution   (A squirt
bottle of water and a squeeze of dish soap will work). Close the windows
with the targa top on and turn the fan on high. From the outside with
the car buttoned up spray the solution around the window-to-car,
window-to-top and fixed window (Get all the cracks that air could
escape). You should see bubbles start to form in the area of your leak
(Like finding a leak on a tire). be generous with the solution as it
makes the leak more apparent and it will clean your window when you wipe
it off. The bubbles are the indicator of where your leak is.

    If you don't have a fan as in the '68 and older (like mine) you can
use the dollar bill trick. Take a 100 dollar bill or a smaller bill will
work and open the door with the window up, place the opened bill between
the window and body, top or roll bar and shut the door. Pull the bill
out from the outside and you should feel resistance. If you don't feel
resistance you have found your leak  If there is resistance open the
door and move the bill over and over with the same technique until you
find the leak

Third, if you can't find the leak using either of the two methods, STOP
and seek a body man.

Fourth, if you find the leak, you can adjust the window by removing the
inner door panel. Locate the window frame adjustment screws usually at
the bottom and or top of the frame. Adjust the in or out to tighten up
the leaky spot. (some older models use washers as an adjustment by
adding or removing washers behind the frame bolt you can "tilt" the
window closer to the top or away). Recheck the leak as well as the rest
of the window to assure it is leak free. Lastly once the job is complete
reassemble the door panel and you have a nice quiet experience.

I would like to here from others with Targa experiences for any other
tips.
