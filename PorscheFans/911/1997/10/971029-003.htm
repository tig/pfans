What is the opinion out there on recovering a 911 (or more specifically a 
993 with the new rear suspension) from a drop-throttle-induced oversteer 
like Eliot experienced below?

Last Sunday I spun on Turn 6 at Thunderhill, when I dropped the hammer too 
quickly right before the apex, overloaded the rear tires (which were 
already operating at large slip angles at that point), got wheelspin, and 
the tail came around.  I applied opposite lock, with neutral throttle (not 
lifting but not applying more gas either), and slid sideways into the dirt 
on the inside of the turn.  No damage, but got the car all dirty.

Back at the paddock some of the guys said I should have applied even more 
throttle when the rear started to go, in order to put more weight on the 
rear tires and regain traction.  I don't understand this method, since it 
was too much gas that caused the wheelspin and loss of traction in the 
first place.  Wouldn't more gas only exacerbate the situation?

I do understand that if you caused the rear to slide from lifting or 
cornering too fast, then to you do have to apply throttle to xfer weight to 
the rear in order to recover.  If the rear wheels are already in wheelspin 
like above, however, how can more gas help?

TIA,
Bob

(snip)

i've put another 100 miles on it in one night, all under a heavy
downpour.  those 3 speed wipers are terrific, there was not a single
drop of water that made it in (this is the new targa) and the new rear
end and ABD/DDD has already saved me from an embarassing potential
spin... (too much gas coming out of a turn in 1st gear)

the tail stepped out and being the 911 novice i lifted... and ..
it did not bite back, it simply collected itself and proceeded.
i then went on and got it to step out a second time later... not
bad, but not entirely predictable in gushing rain.. the thing's
a beast alright... :)
