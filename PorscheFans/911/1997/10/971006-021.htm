I have an '87 Carrera with a stock G50 Tranny. I've always though the
gearing was too tall on my car, but this fix sounds too easy.

Has any one tried running 50 series tires on 15 inch rims with a G50.
Obviously, the speedo will be off and it will wind a little high on the
freeway, but how much? It should make the car a lot punchier out of the
hole and around tight corners not to mention lowering it a bit.

Math? What is the diameter of 15"-60s versus 15"-50s. Can I simply apply
this ratio to my rpm at a given speed to determine the new speed at this
rpm as I saw in Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Hanbook. What is the
differential ratio and transmission ratio of a stock 87 911? Is there
more math I should do?

Other issues - It appears  that this is ok for zone7 AutoX - true or
false?
Do I need/want a wider size to compensate for the shorter sidewall - I'm
running 205 front and 225 rear?
