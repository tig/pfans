I need to replace the rear tires on my 911SC. I am presently using
Michelin XGT-V 225-50 VR's front and back.

The Tire Rack is quoting $186+8 shipping each--this seems a bit high,
but I could be wrong. They also recommend the Pilot SX-GT ($160+8) as a
replacement. 

Out local Price/Costco club offers what appears to be the XGT
replacement (I can't remember the exact model) for $150+tax.

Does anybody have any suggestions for either a cheaper source for XGT's
or a recommended alternate.

FYI, I have gotten 25,400 miles on the rears. The fronts are in good
shape and look like they will last another 25,000. I also notice that
the RR tire has worn faster than the LR. My mechanic says that this is
because I don't have a limited slip differential.

Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.
