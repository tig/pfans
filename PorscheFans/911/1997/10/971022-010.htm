I have a book called "Porsche 911:  Forever Young" (or something like that) by
Tobias Aichele.  It's been a while since I've read it, but I *think* I remember
reading that "SC" stood for "Standard Car".  Of course, this doesn't agree with
what the Porsche Customer Relations guy said (ie., that it has little meaning).
 (But it DOES make sense - the SC was the standard car of the time!)

I'll try to remember to look through the book tonight, and see if I can find
the reference I'm talking about.  (Does anybody else have this book, and
remember reading anything like that?)

Dave
