Hi folks,
Couldn't help adding my $.02  Although chips will increase the BMEP and
internal stress on the engine, this is exactly what any "bolt on"
modification will do if it increases HP.  I don't believe the safety
margin on the 911 engine is so narrow that the slight increase from a
chip will compromise it.  In fact Porsche resorted to remapping the DME
for more power in the 80's.  I whole heartedly agree the concerns with
chips lie in extending the redline (with excessive use) and the
potential for detonation given the wrong octane fuel.  To me this comes
under the heading of responsible use.
My personal experience with chips in an '88 951 (large S turbo) and 91
C4 have been generally positive.  The chips made the cars more
streetable; better part throttle response, and mid range torque plus
better top end on the track.   A normally aspirated motor doesn't
benefit as much as a turbo motor from a chip only upgrade. In the 964,
the engine needs better breathing (exhaust and intake) along with a
remapping to increase the power.  This is essentially (although not
only) what Porsche did with the 993 engine.  I didn't find any
maintenance issues with the 951 and have had no problems other than a
idle stabilization issue with the C4. It comes down to personal choice,
and your need for power versus risk avoidance.  IMHO, the risk is
minimal and the benefits worth it. :^)
