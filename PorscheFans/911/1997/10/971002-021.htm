Yesterday I had the local Porsche dealer perform a 4 wheel alignment.
The printout had a few items that
appeared out of spec.  The dealer says the
differences were minute and nothing to worry about, but hey, this is
Porsche.

The car handles great but appears to wander to the right.  The roads are
so uneven in North Texas it is
difficult to tell if this is due to the
road surface or the crown in the road.  When I drive it down the middle
it seems to go strait - most of
the time.  When I am able to drive on the
left lane of a 2 lane road (unoccupied residential at night) it appears
to drift left!

The car is a 1984 Euro Targa DOT'd for the US.  The left front caster is
5.2 degrees and the right front
caster is 6.2 degrees which gives a caster
difference of 1 degree.  This seems excessive.

Could you folks help me understand if the dealer's shop is avoiding
having to re-do the work or if things
are OK from a practical standpoint?
