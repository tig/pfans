Greetings - 

I called Chevron once and finally got ahold of a Chevron engineer to and
asked him about the Techron issue.  He said all grades of their gas had
about the same amount of Techron and to use the lowest octane suitable
for my car.  He recommended using a bottle of their concentrate once or
twice a year.  I also found the 20oz bottles at Pap Geon in Houston
selling for $4.50 each, the catelogs sell it for about $9.00.  Probably
mismarked, but I bought a couple.   We've got a couple of folks on the
list who work for Chevron, maybe they can enlighten us more.

 >>    I saw your post about Chevron gasoline on the 911 list.  I have a
few
     questions about it.  I also heard from my mechanic that there was a
     service bulletin that recommended Chevron gas.  I can't remember
what
     specifically about Chevron's gas that made it better but Techron
     sounds about right.  I currently put 92 on my car.  But if it makes
     little or no difference between 92 or 89, then, at ~20 gals/fill,
I'd
     choose 89.

     a)  Doesn't Chevron put Techron on all their gas grades?
     b)  Does 92 gas have other cleaners/additives (aside from Techron)
     that the other grades don't have? (This leads to next question)
     c)  Assuming both 92 & 89 have the same amount of Techron, does 92
gas
     have any advantage over 89 on CIS cars?
