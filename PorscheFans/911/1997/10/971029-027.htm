	Sounds like a fair price, Saqib, just get it checked by a good P. mechanic. 
Maybe seller will take $11K?  Minor oil leaks are very common on many 911's,  
and valve cover gasket is one of those places... not too worry too much. Use 
it to bargain. Also, the oil tubes leak chronically on some cars. I seem to be 
lucky with oil leaks (unusual), my motor is pretty dry so far. Bet she will 
leak now, having said that...
	On a Targa, make sure the roof and its seals are in good shape, as many leak, 
I am afraid, and this can be hard to stop. Soak it and look for water entry; 
sit in it and have someone spray a hose all over the roof seals. If it leaks, 
look for rust.
	Make sure the car has not been in a serious wreck. Many 911's are wrecked by 
novice drivers with more cents than sense. I myself almost crashed the second 
week I had my car, I was very lucky indeed. And yes, I had read about Trailing 
Throttle Oversteer....  
	Good Luck, when you have had her for a week or two, come back and tell us how 
you feel about it... I have never regretted my purchase. By the way, SC's are 
an excellent value for the money these days. You get a pretty modern car 
overall, as 911's have not changed that much, and the 3 liter is a good motor 
with enough torque for easy around town driving.  Welcome to the List!    
Enjoy! Warren.

Thanks a lot for your advice. I am very interested in this car. It is in
Kansas City, in very good condition with 77k and the person is asking
$12,500, which seems pretty good for me. The only thing I found in the
car that bothers me is an oil leak from the rear valve cover, but he
said it is not a serious issue.
Anyway, thanks for making me feel welcome on the 911 list.
