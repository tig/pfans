Sam,

Jacobs must now have a system for older 911s and 930s.  Check out the
Performance Catalog #42A, Fall '97.  Page 15 shows a Jacobs system.  I
was hoping to find someone with experience with a system like this.  Is
it hype or HP?  My current stock system works fine and the only reason
to change it would be for upgrading...
