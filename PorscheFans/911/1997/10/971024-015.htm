I make heavy use of my Targa top, and due to the presence of a harness bar in
the back I can no longer just slide the unfolded top behind my seats. I
specifically bought a Targa for the roof-off-but-not-a-cab deal, the car is
not a garage queen and I live in Seattle, so if I take the roof off, leaving
it at home is kind of foolhardy. With the constant folding and unfolding the
material is starting to tear, and I'm starting to get some(more) leaks.

So, I'm thinking a recover is in order, but I'm also thinking that the current
covering could probably be improved on(i.e., some material that doesn't
suffer from the plastic deformation degradation). The requirements:
1: Waterproof(I've already got something that isn't)
2: Windproof(I've seen Targa tops that leaked air due to a tear at the
front... the inflatible roof can't be good for the lifespan of the roof, and
it looks waaaaaaay to silly to cope with).
3: Can handle a winter of near constant rain and snow without mildewing or 
molding.
4: Won't tear if I use it like it's supposed to be used.

Has anyone out there tried alternative materials with any success(or failure
even)? Any suggestions? I was thinking heavy canvas sailcloth might work. But
then again, I don't know if mold or mildew will be a problem with sailcloth.
