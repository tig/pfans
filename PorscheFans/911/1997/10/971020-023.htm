I promised to do more research on this after the many comments about my
first note.
1)It is definitely clear that nitrogen diffuses more slowly through tire
rubber than oxygen. This is confirmed by consulting polymer handbooks and
by talking to engineers at Goodyear,including the race people. This could
be important in passenger cars and is certainly so in large tires on earth
moving equipment. Air also leads to component separation and corrosion of
steel belts. Some day perhaps, we'll all be using nitrogenin our passenger
vehicles.
2)There is definitely  fire hazard with air in the large  tires used in
earth moving equipment...spontaneous combustion because they get VERY
hot,This is not an important factor in racing.
3)nitrogen has low moisture content because of the way its produced and the
way its bottled. With air you have to be more careful, with filters etc,
so, yes those of you who wrote are right..in our level of rACING WITH THE
CRUDE AIR FACILITIES NITROGEN IS BETTER. IN NASCAR RACING , PRACTICE AND
QUALIFYING IS GENERALLY DONE WITH AIR. Sopme teams then bleed this and use
nitrogen in the race, but not all.  In F-1 racing air supplies are
generally used, although nitrogen is available should problems arise with
the air.
This summarizes what I learned.
