It has been awhile, but I'm virtually certain that the KE-Jetronic brain
(on 80-83 SCs) commands "full rich" if it does not see a valid impedance
at the O2 sensor.  This is mentioned in the Bosch literature, and I've
seen it on my own car.  (All assuming, of course, that the warmup cycle
is complete, Idle or WOT switches are not active, etc.)  I've always
wondered why they chose this default state... it is probably safer for
the engine than "full lean", but why not "halfway in between"?

Functioning of the KE controller is easy to check with a dwell meter on
the frequency valve... your mechanic should know how to do this, and
also how to check that the Control Pressure is within spec.  I wouldn't
have thought that the KE closed-loop system had enough adjustment range
to put soot on the plugs, but I've never tried it.  Why not replace
and/or re-connect the O2 sensor?  Do you possibly have other CIS
problems, such as a leaky cold start injector, sticky airflow flapper,
or broken fuel distributor?
