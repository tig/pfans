     Terry,
     
     I saw your post about Chevron gasoline on the 911 list.  I have a few 
     questions about it.  I also heard from my mechanic that there was a 
     service bulletin that recommended Chevron gas.  I can't remember what 
     specifically about Chevron's gas that made it better but Techron 
     sounds about right.  I currently put 92 on my car.  But if it makes 
     little or no difference between 92 or 89, then, at ~20 gals/fill, I'd 
     choose 89.
     
     a)  Doesn't Chevron put Techron on all their gas grades?
     b)  Does 92 gas have other cleaners/additives (aside from Techron) 
     that the other grades don't have? (This leads to next question)
     c)  Assuming both 92 & 89 have the same amount of Techron, does 92 gas 
     have any advantage over 89 on CIS cars?
     
     Your 2 cents are appreciated, but never required.  I value your 
     opinion.
     
     best regards,
     
     Ed Ho
