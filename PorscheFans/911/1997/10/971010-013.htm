Interesting topic.  My 2c worth is that for long down grades, you will heat
your brakes if you use them to maintain speed.  The best advise I got was
to always used the same gear going down hill as you would going up the same
hill.  As far a shifting through the gears at every stop: it is a lot of
work, and lot of wear and tear on the clutch and synchros.  It will not
save a great deal on brake wear either.  However, we all drive these cars
for fun, and spend a lot of money on them.  Why not enjoy the drive?  If
you shift carefully, and avoid abusing the clutch, you will still get
100,000 or more miles out of the clutch and transmission.  If you drive in
competition, or use that style over the road, you need to understand that
maintenance and repair cost increase accordingly.
