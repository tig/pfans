Here are the responses I received.  Thanks to Mike and David.

I rebuilt both of my mirrors for my '82 SC in about 3 hours.  I have 
power
mirrors and the worst part was having to cut the wires to get the 
entire
mirror off the door.  Just make sure that you write down which wires go
where if they are not color coded.  Of course, taking the mirror off 
was
easy because I already had all of the door panels off, etc.. 

What has happened is the 'bolt' has loosened and no longer compresses a
spring within the mirror assembly.  This spring allows the mirror to 
rotate
on the post if it gets hit while also keeping the mirror stable for 
regular
driving.  Unfortunately, the wires run through a hole in the middle of 
this
'bolt' which is also where the allen wrench goes to tighten it.  In 
effect,
you have to take the whole mirror apart to tighten it.

The first thing you have to do is gently pry your mirror glass off of 
it's
mounting plate so you can unscrew the power mirror motor from the cast 
body
part.  Once you take out the motor and wires you can disassemble and 
clean
the 'bolt', spring, and any nylon parts that may or may not have been 
there.
I used a good spray of WD40 to get all the grime off and then wiped
aggressively with a rag.

When you are ready to put the whole thing back together put some all 
purpose
grease in it so it can rotate freely.

It is also good to have two new mirror to door seals on hand in case 
the old
ones are crap.  In my case, both had been cut so the car could be 
painted
and they did not fit well or provide a good seal.  You might also think
about replacing the allen bolt used to secure the mirror to the door if 
it
has gotten a little rusty.

I did the job on an '82 Targa.  
#1 The mirror glass its' self kinda prys off of the mirror glass base. 
 The 
back of the mirror glass has 3 prongs that press into three plastic 
sleeves in 
the mirror glass base.  Carefully pry the glass away from the base. 
 It's 
kinda scary at first but once you see it move it goes pretty easily. 
 Once 
it's loose unplug the heated mirror element from the mirror.

#2 There are 3 hex screws that you can see through the mirror base 
holding the 
base, motor,  and wiring into the mirror housing.  Remove these screws. 
 That 
allows you to pull the "works" out so you can get to everything.  Keep 
a towel 
handy in case you have to leave everything hanging against the car. 
 Towel 
goes between everything you leave hanging and expensive paint.

#3  Now the hard part.  This is where I got stuck the first time.  I 
couldn't 
figure out how to separate the wires from their connector which you 
need to do 
so you can slip the wires through the housing to get at the nut that 
tightens 
the mirror.  Automotion helped by selling me the tool.  It seems like 
the tool 
was $40.  The tool works great.  It is basically a hollow tube with a 
plunger 
that slides through the tube and pushes the wires out of the connector. 
 If 
you buy the little Automotion tool it also comes with instructions

#4  If you figure out a way to get the wires out of the connector make 
sure 
you mark them so they can be reinstalled in the same location in the 
connector.  Now loosen the 4mm allen head bolt in the mirror housing up 
next 
to the door.  it may have a little plastic plug in it.  Be careful to 
only 
loosen it enough to get the mirror housing to come loose from the car, 
otherwise you might drop the nut on the back down into the door.  

#5  Once you have the mirror housing loose from the car it takes,  I 
think,  
an 8 or 9 mm allen wrench to separate the swivel part from the 
stationary 
part.  This is the bolt that is causing the mirror wobble.  Loosen the 
above 
allen head bolt, (it's the hollow one that the wires ran through) clean 
it up, 
and loctite it back on with blue loctite.  

#6  Reverse all the above procedures.
