Dennie:

The whole idea, basically, is to think about what sorts of failures
can suddenly and completely disable your car, then prepare only for
the ones which can be fixed with a minimum of tools and supplies.

For example, it's pointless to carry a case of oil; small oil leaks
are non-disabling -- you can just top off the tank every time you
stop for gas -- and BIG oil leaks generally need a whole lot more
than 12 quarts of oil to "repair".

It's the same with most electrical components... I carried a spare
wiring harness in my trunk for years, until I realized that if
anything failed so severely as to melt my existing harness,
replacing it with a new one wouldn't fix the problem (fuses are the
same, but I carry a spare set, anyway, since they don't take up any
space in the glove box).

On the other hand, it makes a lot of sense to carry a spare fan
belt; it takes up essentially no space in the trunk, and if your fan
belt breaks, replacing it is all that's (generally) needed to get
you moving again.

My feelings about on-the-road do-it-yourself repairs has changed a
LOT over the years... I've traveled cross-country in the Porsche
about a dozen times, and my "emergency spares and tools" list has
gotten smaller each time.  On my first trip, I practically FILLED the
car with tools -- I even carried jack stands -- but on my last trip,
I didn't even carry a spare tire (which, by the way, I don't
recommend).

Since your car's "in great shape", you probably don't need more than
the following:

    A good spare tire and a jack and lug wrench (and, if you have
    wheel locks, the key or socket or whatever for them), or, if
    you're as brave/stupid as I am, you can just carry a can of
    Fix-A-Flat and/or a tire repair kit,

    a tire gauge (NEVER trust the gauges on gas-station
    compressors),

    a spare fan belt,

    a spare ignition key (in your wallet, tied to your shoelace, or
    concealed securely somewhere on the exterior of your car),

    a cellular phone,

    the March issue of Porsche Panorama (which contains the names,
    addresses, and phone numbers of all the PCA regional officers),

    a AAA card (sign up for their "Plus" membership; it only costs a
    few dollars more, but -- among other things -- it increases the
    free towing distance from seven miles to 100 miles),

    a Swiss Army knife or Leatherman tool,

    a credit card,

    condoms (as George Carlin says, "Just the stuff you HOPE you'll
    need"),

    and $100 or so in cash.

If you really want to, you can carry a few wrenches and screwdrivers
(and shop rags, work gloves, etc.), but with the cell phone, AAA
membership, PCA directory, and credit card, you should be able to
quickly get someone ELSE to fix any mechanical breakdown no matter
where you are.

If your trip will take you into the mountains, you may want to carry
a can or two of octane-booster for the descent back to lower
altitudes, since the pump gas you'll get at the higher elevations
won't exceed 91 octane.

You also might want to put a bra on the car and carry a spray-bottle 
of window cleaner (I like Clear-Vue) and some towels.

Make sure you inspect the car before the trip... Check the tires,
replace the windshield wipers and make sure you have
windshield-washer fluid, change the oil, etc.

I never travel without a fire extinguisher and a few flares... Since
you'll be driving in the winter, you should also pack tire chains, a
heavy coat and gloves, and an ice scraper for the windshield (which
you may not be able to buy in your home town; pick one up at the
first gas station that offers them for sale).

Have fun on your trip...
