Brian,
      can I offer you a suggestion with your right hand drive
conversion. I don't know how capable you are as far working with cars
but having been through all this just recently I suggest you give your
car to someone to do the entire conversion. Someone reputable of course.

A friend of mine and myself bought back two 930's last year and thought
we would do it ourselves bar the panel changes in the trunk. Well one
year and one week later (but who is counting) my car is on the road. My
mates car is still some 6 weeks away which will take it to 18months by
the time it is finished. It would have to be one of the most traumatic
experiences I have had and swear I will never do it like that again.
Anyway enough heart ache.
If you give me your e-mail address I will explain the sagas to you and
who to buy the stuff from.
