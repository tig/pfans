William Cline - you want an opinion on an SC clutch?  Happy to oblige
with mine - as long as you don't replace with rubber center (fat chance
of that), doesn't matter.  OEM/aftermarket OEM replacement (Sachs is
OEM, I think) will work just fine.  At least if you are not a drag racer.  the
clutch does not seem to be a weak point on our cars (rubber centers
excepted).  I have some sort of OEM replacement I use with  my race
engines (2 engines, one clutch - it gets swapped), which I hope make
more ponies than an SC.  It works as well as a nice segmented, brass
flecked friction material "racing" disk I used one year and gave to a guy
who had let me borrow an RSR PP, flywheel, and ring gear.   Plus the
ordinary disk in my SC street/racer has lasted a long time - I think I got it
about 10 years ago.

Now if you are talking a 400+ HP turbo, maybe you need something more.
And if someone out there makes some junk disks, and they find their way
to us via Automotion, or NAPA, or some distribution channel, maybe the
List can illuminate us.  I've never heard of a bad, el cheapo brand of
clutches for our cars, but you never know, and others have their ear
closer to the markets than I.
