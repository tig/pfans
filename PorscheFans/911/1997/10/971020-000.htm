  Alan:

  IMHO, setting your timing on a 911 by listening for detonation shares
a few things with playing with blasting caps. You could be in for an
expensive surprise :^) . The margin of detonation in a 911 engine is
determined by many factors, fuel quality, cylinder head temperature,
ambient air temperature, to name a few. This is why the factory's all
went to adaptive ignitions with knock sensors. A 911 engine is noisy
enough that you cannot hear a phenomena called sub-audible detonation
which is just as destructive as the louder kind that you can hear.
Unless you are planning to use a fuel with sufficient octane to maintain
a wider margin such as unleaded racing gasoline, you might consider to
remain within the stock timing specifications.
 The most important timing setting is at 6000 RPM. Set the timing to no
more than 35-36 degrees at 6K, and you will have no problems. Failure to
do so can cost you some pistons and cylinders. Check the prices of those
items along with the labor to change them before you get adventurous
with your timing numbers.

If you need more performance, and who doesn't :^), there are other
things that are far safer........

Hope this helps shed some light here....
