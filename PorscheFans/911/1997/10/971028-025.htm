In reponse to Richard Shearer's question about wind noise on his 88 Targa, 
I have the same problem on my 87 Targa once I had the top reskinned.  My 
problem stems from one of the four front clips periodically popping loose.  
I posted a question last month asking for suggestions but got no reponses.  
Are there larger clips out there?

As an aside, after 28 years of marriage and owning my Targa since new (87), 
I finally am taking a dream Porsche vacation (alone).  Started just west of 
Kansas City, to Denver, to Publeo (left the Interstate at this point) over 
the mountains through Gunnison, CO to Durango, to Mesa Verde (the trip from 
Gunnison to Mesa Verde is great), to the Grand Canyon, through Sedona to 
Phoenix (finally rejoined the Interstate) to Tucson to Dallas via 180 ( a 
great road accross New Mexico and Texas).  Unfortunately I now have head 
home via Interstate.  Car ran great (turned 95,000 today) other than the 
top clip popping about once a day.
