Robert,

The tumbler mechanism is hard to replace because of the steering wheel
interlock.  Two (or three?) screws hold the electrical switch part of the
ignition switch to the back of the tumbler mechanism.  You can see them if
you look up under the dash.  Remove the wires, remove the screws, replace
the electrical switch, replace the screws, replace the wires and you are
back in business.  That is the good news.......The bad news is you need a
size verrrrrry small hand to get the screws in and out.  My big ham fists
wouldn't fit so I had to cajole my bride of 37 years into doing the job.  It
took her all of 10 minutes.  That is the good news.........The bad news is
it cost me a dinner, a night on the town and a new outfit to convince her
she should waste her time with "that old thing in the garage that you are
always twiddling with...".

 I have a 79 911SC that has a broken ignition switch. How involved is it
to replace this? The car starts and runs but when I turn the key to the
off position the engine keeps running. Can you rebuild the switch or do
I need a new one? Where can I get the right price for this part? Thanks
for any suggestions.RE

I bought a black and a red spare key from the automotion catalog.  I assumed
that both blanks would be identical but  that is not the case.  Maybe one key
is for the ignition and one is for the doors?  Presently I only have one
orginal key that fits both the ignition and doors.  Can anyone help?

I posted a message on the Porschefans website a couple of months ago about a
911 purchase.  After about 6 months of searching I ended up buying a red/blk
-84 targa.  I was trying to find a newer car but this one was too good to let
pass!  The 911 has 60k miles, sport seats, 16" wheels, alpine cd, service
recs, one owner.  Also, I saved ~ $10k over a decent -88 to -91 model.  I also
joined the Carolinas region PCA  without delay.
