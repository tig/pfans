	Well last Friday I took delivery of my new 1998 911 C2S
	from Beverly Hills Porsche, having flown down that morning
	from the Bay Area.

	I had just left the dealership and was heading down 
	Wiltshire Blvd, when not 5 minutes after I had taken
	delivery of the car, some assh*le in a Merc behind me
	decided to leave the traffic lights we were both waiting
	at faster than I, result, my rear bumper is damaged,
	the impact absorbers have collapsed and the heat shield
	is bent ... a cool $2500 worth of repairs ...

	What's worse is that the guy only gave me his card & driving
	license (I know ... I know, I screwed up) ... and he has'nt
	returned my calls all this week (his message service is 
	getting sick of me leaving calls for him).

	So, looks like I'll be fixing this one out of my own pocket!

	Sigh ... not the best way to start my Porsche experience!

	Anyone any advice on how to proceed with a claim against
	such an apparently illusive character?

	- Larry.
