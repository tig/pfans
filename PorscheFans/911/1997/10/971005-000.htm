My question is: Is a 911 driveable (safely) in snow with winter tires or
should I buy another car? (I have no experience with winter tires,
therefore the dumb-sounding question). 

....I had the same problem/question a few years ago, when I was using a 
1992 964 as my daily driver here in Vienna, where what you said about 
Munich winters also applies.....

Using summer tires (factory Brigestones) , I often could not even get the 
car out of the parking space. 

Putting on winter tires (narrow 205/50/16 _on all 4 wheels_ with the ugly 
stock 964 wheels that nobody wants, so I got them real cheap) transformed 
the car like you would not believe. I could drive when everybody else was 
stuck in the snow, reminded me of the old VW beetles that I drove back 
when I was a student. 

The RS may be a bit low though.


.........Which makes of winter tires work
best with a 911?.......

I believe it does not make such a big difference, as long as you use 
winter tires at all. You wont believe the difference.

btw, is "Slalom" the same as "autocross"? 

Gute Fahrt
