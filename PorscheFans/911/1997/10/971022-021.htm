Well, if you consider broken rings and melted pistons as "damage" rather
than "wear", I guess you can claim it is "ridiculous" to worry about
engine wear caused by aftermarket chips.  But the very re-mapping of
ignition and fuel flow that Mr. Buxton mentions does two things: 1)
increases cylinder pressure (technically, BMEP), producing more power
but also more wear, and 2) reduces factory-designed margins against
knocking and detonation, which have a well documented history of
breaking rings and melting pistons in 911 engines.  There ain't no free
lunch.

That said, let me also say that I agree with Mr. Buxton that if you use
a reputable chip, use the required grade of gas (premium in every case
I've heard of), and drive your car with a sensitive ear (or have your
mechanic take it for a blast if you're not sure what knocking sounds
like)... you're highly unlikely to have a problem.  I'd leave the chip
in there.  Your engine has plenty of stress margin for a few percent
more power, and as long as you can get good gas a reputable chip
shouldn't knock.  Your engine is *strong*... that's one of the reasons
you bought the car, right?.... change the oil often, warm it up
considerately, and DRIVE IT LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE DRIVEN... HARD! 
You have a glorious machine back there, let it do its thing... don't
condemn it to a life of half throttle and 3k rpm shifts...
