The car that lost power over bumps and then refused to start is
now running. I don't know why. The only 'repairs' I made were:
a) replaced sections of the small wires from the coil (called the
'1' and '15' wires I believe) which had brittle and cracking insulation.
b) There is a wire enterning from the left floor of the engine
compartment that is not in a wiring harness and ends in a plug
like unto a cigarette lighter plug. I assumed it had been knocked
loose while wrestling the air blower out of the car so reconnected
it in the general vicinity of the CD ignition module. What is this wire?

Would either of these 'fixes' address the symptoms I saw? Should
I now trust the car to be well? I am pleased to have it running but
somewhat annoyed not to be able to troubleshoot a problem that
is no longer there.

After hearing that the fuel flow at the injectors is supposed to just
dribble, I was all set to have the car towed to the shop. I was putting
back all the removed pieces and thought I'd give the car one last
chance to come to life. Am I a great mechanic or what?

Opinions are solicited.
