Hi all!

I'm new to the list. ...Been in the market for a '911 for ... several years
now!  I keep coming up with one reason or another not to buy one.  But now,
I've finally decided that, while I'm still young, I deserve this!

Specifically, I'm looking for an '87 Carrera.  I definitely want an '84 or
later, since most all of the problems that the earlier cars had were taken care
of by then.  I'd prefer an '87 because of the newer tranmission.

Anyway, I'm wondering if there are any problems specific to this year that I
should be aware of.  I've done a lot of research, and am familiar with the
valve-guide-wear problem of the 3.2's, and also the smaller head studs that
could sometimes fail...  Are there any other things I could be overlooking?
 This car will be my daily driver for at least a year, before I make it a
weekender, so I want to make sure I check everything out!

Any ideas?

BTW:  I've been on auto-related mailing lists before, and I know it can get
tiring listening to newcomers ask their "what should I look for" questions!
 Sorry - bear with me!  But at least in my case, I've done some research on my
own before I've asked for everyone else's assistance! ...For whatever that's
worth! ....
