Yahooo! So far the list seems to be working again…

Hmmmm… just installed a new (used) airflow meter on my '87 3.2. I thought
this would get rid of a small stutter that occurred between 2500 and 2700
rpm under low throttle and I also hoped this would solve the idle trouble
(when the engine is nice and warm for about 30 mins. it idles at 1100 rpm
after releasing throttle. After a shorth blip on the gas or pulling the
gaspedal back will bring the idle back at 700 or 800 again). The throttle
response has improved noticably, but it didn't solve the problems (the
stutter or high idle when warm), so I guess that it's not the source of the
problem. Except for this the engine runs perfectly. Any of you listies have
any suggestions about what COULD be causing the stutter/high idle?
TIA
