Symptoms recapped:
First noticed Thursday morning. Temperature 75, steady drizzle.
Car started normally, ran normally...until I would hit a bump
in the road at which time I would lose engine power for about as long as
it would take my shocks to rebound. As if ignition was cutting out
temporarily. Radio and lights seemed unaffected...
Now, the engine will kick on readily but immediately die.

Suggestions received:
Mike suggested I make sure my coil is not loose and grounding out.
Hank hunched it would be a bad engine/body ground strap.
Walt suggested I "check the big boot connecting the air cleaner/air
measuring side of the CIS on the right with the throttle body on the
left. I had one tear once on me, which let air leak in, messing up the
measuring function. Temporary repair with duct tape worked for a 1000
mile trip. They can also work loose where the two large hose clamps hold
them on."
John "suspects that a bump in the road causing problems, may be a fuel
distribution related issues. Maybe a bad mechanical fuel pump , starving
the engine of fuel with the bump. Also check air valve, or sensors."
Thank you very much for the suggestions. It provides confidence to begin
a task when there is some idea of where the problem may lie. My Haynes
manual is much dirtier now and I've learned a lot about how my car is put
together. The electrical system seems functional and the problem in this
case appears to be in the fuel system. All I get are dribbles at the tubing

connection to the injectors. The car runs well on canned starting fluid.

Further primary questions about fuel system:
I haven't found my fuel pump yet (I understand it is below gas tank) but
I disconnected the tubing to the fuel accumulator and am getting flow.
How do I qualify the flow? Can I just measure flowrate or do I need to hook
up a pressure gauge in some way? How much is enough? Fuel pump is
$200 so I'd like to narrow the diagnosis before replacement. If I remove
it, can I test it off the car easily?

My engine bay gas filter was replaced 6000 miles ago.
Should I suspect it? Will it get clogged enough to acutely restrict flow?

My air flow sensor moves smoothly by hand. What else do I check on this?

The fuel distributor itself is not suspect...or is it?

Any advice is most welcome!

Secondary questions:
I noticed my fuel injector seemed to spin easily as I turned it by hand
after
unhooking the small tubing to it. Is this normal? Unscrewing it didn't seem

to back it out of the engine. Am I missing something? Is the injector just
screwed in like a spark plug until it seats?

While I have my air blower out, I plan to replace the injector seal gaskets
to try to alleviate high speed pinging I suspect to be air leakage. This
looks to be a straightforward job if I can remove the injectors. I plan to
vacuum around the injectors before removing them and soak the injectors
in Techron after removing. Is there anything else I should do while here?
Is anti-sieze acceptable on injector threads and fuel tubing connections?

Thanks,

Andy
