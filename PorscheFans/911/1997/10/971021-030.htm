Dear 911ers

I got no response from the Racing list, but maybe someone on this list
knows:

My Mocal oil thermostat came with instructions which told you how to
figure out which end was up, so to speak, as there are no helpful
arrows or labels cast into the piece, just the name Mocal.  The end with
the heads of the 4 small bolts nearest it was the "from the engine to the
oil cooler" side, and the end with the nuts for these bolts nearest it was
the "from the oil cooler to the tank" side.  Problem was, my thermostat
doesn't have any nuts - the allen style bolts engage threads cut into the
casting down where the nuts otherwise might be.  I assumed that the
bolt head end was the bolt head end, despite lack of nuts on other end. 
Anyone know for sure if that is correct?

market stuff, having problems with heat despite apparent ample
capacity)
