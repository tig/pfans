Chris, from what I have been told (including B. F. Goodrich), the old theory
of center wear meaning high tire pressure is no longer valid with modern 
low aspect ratio tires (60 series or smaller, ;i.e., 50, 45, 40, 35 etc.
series).
Now, apparently what happens on really wide tires is that if the pressure is
too
low, the tire flexes too much and the center is forced out by centrifugal
force,
therefore wears faster.  So, surprisingly, underinflation and overinflation
might
both result in center wear.

Recommendations I have heard is to go with the car manuf. values; I think
Porsche still has values for "high speed" use?

This is the worst possible advice.Tyres wear in the centre due to _too much_
pressure.If you deliberately over inflate a tyre,and put a straight edge
across
the width of the tread,you will see the tyre has expanded more in the centre
than near the sidewalls.Reducing pressure will help prevent excess centre
tread
wear.it _may_ however,alter handling in a manner you may not desire.

44 PSI sounds a hell of a lot for any road car tyre,used _on the road_.

The end result may be that given your car and geometry and tyre
combination,it
is just "one of those things" in that you accept uneven wear,or compromise
the
handling traits you desire...
