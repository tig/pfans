Hi everyone,

I have recently fitted a Pioneer KEH-8200RDS tape/radio into my C2 Tip
(91) and am experiencing a strange buzzing (which is related to engine
speed) when playing tapes. I don't have a power amp fitted (yet :) ) and
the speakers are the original Blaupukts that came (I assume) with the
car.

Has anyone else experienced similar noises - can I fit a supressor to
the alternator or radio feed to stop it?? Will this affect anything
else??? Where, incidentally IS the alternator????

This is my first Porsche and I have only owned it for 3 weeks so I am
unexperienced with the electrics in the car and don't want to cause any
damage to any of the other components such as the computer.

Every experience I have had with the car in these first 3 weeks has been
wonderful, terriffic (not to mention occasionally terrifying :) ) and
despite monsterous petrol prices in the UK and damn traffic everywhere
you go, I have no regrets at all!


Many thanks in advance.
