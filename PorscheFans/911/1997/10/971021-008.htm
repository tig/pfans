Andy -

I have two sony amps under the passenger seat of my '89 911 -
My seat came off simply by unscrewing the allen screws  - they
have these 1" x 2" metal blocks under the rails, and they're tapped
to accept the screws - if you just let them fall, they're easy to recover
from under the rails with a magnetic grabber...

My bolts (did I call them screws? - shame!) were torqued like hell,
so be careful you dont wallow out the heads - I did, and had to drill one
of 'em out...

the seats have a electrical plug to give 'em power to move, it just pops
off once you have the bolts off, and the seat tilted back...

My car had a puny factory amp there already, so it had a terminal for
direct battery power - otherwise I ran all new wires up to the stereo...


Hope this helps - you can email me direct if you have mo questions...
