Hi! P-fans
  I have come by a '74 911 Targa that has been in storage for the last 11
years, and I am now trying to get it up and running.
  After changing oil, gas, replacing gas lines, and other things I can get
it to run OK but it is very hard to start.
  It will fire off on the first crank and runs about 10 to 15 seconds then
dies; after repeated start tries it will fire off again (with the hand
throttle all the way out) but revs to 3,500 and then comes down to the
2,000 after 20 seconds or so. Seems this high rpms is bad on the engine,
but if I close the hand trottle a bit it will not run; after the problem
start and one or two munites warm up, it seems to run great, not much
smoke.  The Oil Level gauge goes up to normal for a while then pegs,(oil
pressure is around 20 to 60) I have changed oil now two times thinking I
put too much oil in but the same thing. When checking the oil by dip stick
it is OK so maybe the gauge is off, I have seen e-mail on this and not
conserned with this right now.
  The car has 124,000 miles on it and now after meany runs around the
neighborhoods, and getting the oil up to about 180=B0, the oil leaks have
almost stopped.
  I have a problem getting it regersterd, NO title, NO smog, been waiting 7
weeks for DMV to send a new title.
  It has been hot 250=B0 when I took it out for a long run after first
getting it to run; but on that run I was stopped by a Sheriff (the car was
smoking a lot), he let me go,:-) but now I will wait till it has tags
before the next longer run.

My real consern is; are there adjustments I can do to stop this hard
starting or do I take it to the Porsche shop?
