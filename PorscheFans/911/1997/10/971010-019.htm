The whale tail alters the airflow (increases the pressure at the air
intake point) and DOES increase airflow and thus engine cooling a bit. 
However your engine/car is designed to stay cool WITHOUT the tail, and
by '87 they actually had a design that worked under nearly all
conditions... so reverting to the stock aerodynamics shouldn't cause any
significant temperature problems.  It's been awhile since I removed, and
later re-installed, the factory spoiler on my '83, but I seem to
remember a 10-20 F increase in cylinder head temp without it... about
the same as you get operating the car at 3-4000 foot altitudes, and
presumably well within the normal operating envelope for the engine.

An EVEN MORE IMPORTANT thing to worry about if you remove the rear
spoiler, is to remove the extra rubber lip from the front air dam, or
change it to whatever was stock for the 87's.  The aerodynamics have to
be balanced front and rear... I assume by now that your uncle knows that
he has a car that is rather sensitive to front/rear balance.  If you
don't change the front too, the rear of the car will be light and loose
at high speeds (like above an air speed of, say, 90 mph).  Not at all
what one wants when showing friends how fast one's new toy will go...
