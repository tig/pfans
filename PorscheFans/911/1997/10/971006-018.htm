You guys, except for Rob, have to leave your email addresses when you want a 
reply or else we have to post (like this) for all to see.   


Anyways, to answer you inquiries in reference to the 1974 911s for sale, the 
car is located in New Jersey currently.  It will also be (with me) at the PCA 
club outing at Watkins Glen, NY on October 17,18.

The color is Kelly Green.

The car is a turn  key reliable track fun car.    The car, since I've been 
running it (after the upgrades and full rebuild) has never broken down.   It 
could run G well in PCA club racing, or perhaps F against the SC's.   The 
weight is low, so the power-to-weight distribution is pretty efficient.  The 
car weighs 2340 and has no fiberglass, so it could be a heck of a lot lighter, 
but I think that's close to the limit for the minimum weights, but not sure.  
It seems to change more often than I can keep up with.

It's a car that could really be taken in many directions, street, autocrosser, 
driver's ed, time trials, etc.


Please reply if still interested.

Regards, and thanks for the interest.   -Mike
