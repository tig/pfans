"How difficult is it to put an '85 911 turbo suspension on a std. '72 911?

Jon Kretzschmar"

Jon - It looks like a pretty big deal.  You need to relocate the semi-trailing
arm inner mount.  

In front, you need (if you really want a turbo suspension) to cut and
relocate some sheet metal and the mounts for the suspension
crossmember so it is a bit higher up in the car, and then space down the
front A arm mount (that part is easy) - this was the anti-dive built into the
turbos.  At least this is what I remember from many readings of Bruce
A's book, which has some information on this.  the factory Turbo
workshop manual has dimensions for moving things around in the front.  I
suspect if you ignored the anti-dive and just installed the turbo struts and
hubs and brakes in front, that would be pretty easy.

Turbo Cvs are different also, so you'd need those (they are a larger
diameter with corresponding different bolt circle, no?  all I know is they
cost a lot more).  One would hope that the axles are the same so you
could just add the outer Cvs from the turbo, and leave your inners alone. 
Otherwise, you need axles and compatible tranny output flanges.  Or
you have to make some kind of adapter, as I think that the stub axle from
a regular 911 won't fit the turbo with its stronger bearings placed more
outboard.

But pay heed to whatever other advice you get from the list.  Maybe it is
a piece of cake  - I've never seriously tried to do this, as it always
seemed likely to be less expensive to purchase a turbo, even if it needed
some fixing, than to make one up more or less from scratch.   What good
is the suspension if you don't add the front and rear flares to take
advantage of the track and tire size potential?  Etc.  Then you find your
car is slower (because of the wider body) unless you compensate with
a turbo engine.  And so on.
