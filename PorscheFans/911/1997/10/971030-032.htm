They're not the same.

Over in North America, at least, they were produced a year apart. The 1988
was the "Special Commemorative Edition" commemorating the 250,000th 911 to
roll off the production line. The 1989 was the 25th Anniversary model.

The 250,000th had the FP signature seats, and was available in only a couple
of colours, notably Diamond Blue metallic, and I believe also a pearl white
metallic though my memory is hazy here. Wheel centers were in body colour.
The interior colour was also a special colour - "Silver Blue".

The 25th anniversary model did not have the FP seats as far as I know, but
had a plaque on the dash, and was available only in black (metallic?), silver
and I believe white as well.

Many books identify the 250,000th commemorative edition car as a "25th
Anniversary" car. This is incorrect according to the people I have spoken
with at Porsche when I was researching one of these cars...

I'm afraid I have no idea what differences there would be for a Finnish
car!

Look at the following web page for a brief description of the 250,000th 
edition car:

http://www.olemiss.edu/~waletail/1988silv.htm

The same site also has a brief page on the 25th anniversary edition, but
it includes the same picture (of a 250,000th edition car) with no real
description.

Cheers,

Ross
