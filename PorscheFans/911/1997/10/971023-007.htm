Group:
To continue the debate on this weighty topic...

Despite Mr. Jurgen's "suggestion" that SC means nothing at all, as
reported by Steve Boorman, and despite Jurgen's acknowledged fame...I
believe he is wrong.  (and you will note from Steve's posting that
Jurgen did not state his opinion as the definitive answer...or base it
upon some clear documentation from the factory.)

Where Jurgen goes astray is failure to recognize that the S designation
is not  performance related .  A review of prior Porsche nomenclature
shows that the S was used in prior models to designate a level of trim,
creature comforts, etc., and not necessarily more ponies behind one's
bottom.  No one will deny that the SC had a high level of trim (some say
too much) compared to the base car.  That is just what was going on in
the'60s with the S model of the early 911, it was the more opulent car
compared to the base 911. 
Thus, the S designation makes sense from the trim level and the C from
the fact that this car carried the 3.0 liter engine from the Carrera
(discontinued).

Until Paul Frere tells me I am wrong, or someone comes up with a factory
source, I will continue to hold to my analysis, and that of others, that
the SC letters come from the earlier models of the S and Carrera...and
the history of the S, from the 356, means "Super".
