Does anyone know of the percentage of 911 SC's that were produced with the 
Full Leather interior? By this I mean the dash is covered in leather, the door 
panels, the console has leather trim, door pockets rimmed in leather, rear 
package shelf,  etc. Some cars have some leather on the seats but not 
elsewhere, I notice; I don't mean this type of interior. It seems that many 
SC's have fabric or vinyl seating. 
	I have personally guessed that the full leather cars number substantially 
less than a fifth of those I have seen over the years, but this is a most 
informally researched figure. Anyone have actual data on this? Later 911's 
seem to have had a higher percentage of leather covered cars as the prices 
have risen on the line overall. 
	Does anyone besides me remember when a 911 was a great, fairly affordable 
sports car rather than a snob appeal item? 81 SC with full leather interior, 
in pretty nice shape..  thanks     Warren.
