Ok, flame on!  (For those of you old enough to remember the Fantastic
4.)
I saw a Boxster, silver, in my neighborhood the other day at a filling
station.  I honked at the man and waved at him, then pulled over in my
951 and started to talk to him.  I said things like nice car, how do you
like it, I might want one, how is maintenance?  He treated me like a
bug, snobbily told me the car needed no work except at 15k mile
intervals and pulled away.  There was a clue;  He said he had owned a
911 before.
Now, please tell me if I'm wrong, but 911 drivers seem to have this
built-in snobbiness about them, and I am wondering if this is spreading
like some crawling disease to those who own Boxsters.  Not very good
magazine reviews of late for Boxsters, unfortunately, hmm?  Heaven help
us when a Corvette can beat a Porsche at anything...
I am sick of 911 drivers!  This doesn't seem to be a 356 owner problem,
or a 928 problem, or a 924 problem, Mustang owners are nice, Firebird
owners, Camaro owners all wave if you say hi, but not the owners of
super-modified Beetles.   I wonder why.  
If you see someone in a 944 or 924 or 928 flash his headlights at you or
wave at you or tell you you have a nice car, do us the honor of saying
hello.  Since most of us can blow the doors off of anything you have or
at least out-handle your cars stock/stock you should at least be
polite.  Remember, Generation Next won't be able to tell an air-cooled
Porsche from a lamppost.

Flame Off!

PS:  I could be wrong about Porsche scrapping air-cooled cars of
course.  With the teething problems of the Boxster, maybe Porsche will
continue to make 911s for a few more years.
PPS:  If the Boxster gentleman, who was seen at 46th and College in
Indianapolis, is on this list your car needed serious detailing.  I note
that your wheels were very dirty.
