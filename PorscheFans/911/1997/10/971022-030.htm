I have no idea who started everyone worrying about extra wear being put on a
car by changing the computer chip, but it's ridiculous.  In no way does a
computer chip put any more strain on your engine.  All they do is re-map the
timing, fuel injector flow and rpm limiter.  If you buy a quality chip from
the likes of AutoThority they come with a money back satisfaction guaranteed
warranty fo at least one year.  Plus, they've been extensively tested before
being sold to the public.  I have both AutoThority chips in my 87 928S4 and
couldn't be happier.  Don't succumb to old wive's tales.  Buy a chip, drive
fast (but safely), enjoy life.

Au contraire, Bon Ami.  The chips may be safe now, but early Autothority
Chips were apparently slightly misprogrammed.  Instead of running the
mixture to full rich when the rev limiter was encountered, the mixture
was set to full lean.  Doesn't take much imagination to understand that
this small error could have some truly major effects.  There were some 
interesting discussions between some people I know and that company 
about replacing some 3.2L motors.  You can also well imagine that
Autothority didn't graciously ship out a check for $6000 in the next
FedEx shipment.  

There are also some reasonable concerns that the safety margin the
factory provides between redline as delivered and what the stock
rods & rod bolts will tolerate for long periods of time is not sufficiently
great to be worth risking increasing the redline by very much.  Most of
the people I know who want extra rpms without increasing risk of
engine problems go through the drill of replacing at least the rod bolts.
Of course, this is a lot tougher than just slipping a little chip into the
car.

Bottom line: probably most of the bugs are out of most of the chips
by now and probably the increased risks of rod or rod bolt failure won't
be evident on most motors.  Whether or not that is acceptable to 
a given car owner is a matter of choice.
