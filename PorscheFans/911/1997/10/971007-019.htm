Hi, Pfans - 

     While trying to get my 76 911 CIS running, I came across a 
     question I can't answer.  While debugging a stuck fast 
     idle/failure to cold start, I follow the trouble shooting tree in 
     my CIS fault manual to "Test Auxiliary Air Valve".  Now this is 
     on odd device that looks like a flying saucer with 2 pipes coming 
     out of it.  It is plumbed in parallel with the "Auxiliary Air 
     Regulator", which looks like the traditional CIS fast idle device 
     I have seen on Audis and VWs.  The Auxiliary Air Valve, however, 
     in the cutaway drawing looks like a vacuum operated diaphragm 
     which shuts itself off in the presence of manifold vacuum.  In 
     fact, the test called out for it says to take the hoses off and 
     blow through it.  It must be open with the engine off.  And, one 
     would presume, closed with the engine on.  Which suggests to me 
     that it could be replaced with a plug.  
     
     So, what does this thing do?  Can I simply delete it?
     
     Thanks, Maureen
