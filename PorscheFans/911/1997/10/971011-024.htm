This question has probably been asked a thousand times...I know I've got a
years worth of PFANs messages I've already searched through.  I'm looking to
get the paint freshened or a complete Re-paint on my 82 SC.  The problem
that I'm running into is this: 

I've stopped into a couple of paint/auto body shops in my area (Woodstock
Illinois) and received a couple of different answers with regard to Chips
and problem areas (light rust beginning to form under front left headlight)
and received a few different suggestions.  Ranging from you could get it
touched up to you need a complete repaint. 

The best advice I think I received was from a local body shop who suggested
I find some one who "loves" Porsches and have them do the work.

Most of the messages I reviewed from here have originated in the coastal
areas and though they have been somewhat helpful I would like to know if
anyone has experience with some of the body shops in my area.  I phoned a
company in Barrington called BodyWerks who gave me an over the phone quote
of 6k to repaint the car.  I asked if that included removal of the old paint
and the gentleman on the other end said "no" he would be most likely
painting over the existing paint.  

I thought this was a bit steep for that kind of painting...but another shop
said no that might be the best way to go since removal of the old paint
could also remove the galvanising Porsche did to the car.  

I really don't want to have to sink more than 3-3500 into a complete paint
since  I don't feel the car is worth that type of investment....I could sell
it in as is condition and go purchase an 87.  

Anyone have a suggestion or path I might be able to take?  What kind of
costs am I looking at?
