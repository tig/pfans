What I found when I did this to my '84 Carrera:

1) much easier to adjust valves
2) slightly louder (more throaty) exhaust sound
3) probably reduced heat buildup in left rear of engine, saving exhaust
guides
4) test pipe is lighter than cat
5) don't have to worry about getting stranded somewhere due to cat getting
clogged (happened to a friend of mine - couldn't even get car up driveway, it
clogged the exhaust so bad)

As far as performance, in timed measured runs in third gear from 3000 - 6000
RPM acceleration, can't say I found an improvement.

(reply to:)

Getting ready to do my first valve adjustment. Two questions:
  1.) I have two notches on the rear half of my crankshaft pulley (78 3.0).
My guess is they're Z1 and 5 deg BTDC, with Z1 being the one on the left
(have to use a mirror to see the markings). When I position the pulley at the
Z1 mark, my rotor does not point at the mark on the distributor for number 1,
it's several degrees off. Would this be because the timing is not to specs?
Should I ignore that mark and just use Z1?
  2.) Having removed my catalytic converter for access to the left-side
exhaust valves, I'm tempted to not put it back on (some of us live where the
nearest neighbor has a different zip code). Although there are increased
horsepower claims in some of the ads in Excellence and Panorama if one
installs a test pipe, I seem to remember Bruce Anderson saying that there are
no benefits to removing the cat. Perhaps the only possible benefit would be
reduced weight and saving your catalytic converter for when you move to the
city. So..the question..does anyone feel removal is a plus?
