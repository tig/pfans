Hi all,

I'm wondering if the following is normal for a 1990 C2?

Transitioning from a completely-shut throttle to an open throttle seems
to involve a brief (1/10th second? less? more?) hesitation. There is a
microswitch on the throttle arm which I assume is emissions-related - I
suspect it shuts off fuel supply under certain conditions with a closed
throttle... this is noticeable when going down a hill with the throttle
closed - just touching the accelerator pedal will have a very noticeable
effect. I believe this microswitch and/or associated circuitry is responsible
for the hesitation.

The hesitation is a pain as it affects downshifting - if I double-clutch
and let the throttle close completely during the shift out of the higher
gear, it takes an extra heartbeat to bring the revs up while in neutral.

The accelerator seems to be adjusted properly - no free play that I can
find at all in the linkage - the throttle arm in the engine bay moves
instantly as soon as the pedal is touched.

Any thoughts?

Cheers!

Ross

(P.S. On the plus side, I found the secret to heel/toe for me at least...
 adjusting the seat as far DOWN as it will go made things MUCH easier!!!)
