Mike,
 Someone also posted this solution and I responded (offline)
with this caution: 
"Be careful. If you adjust the gas pedal to have more travel
and don't adjust the throttle linkage you may bend the 
throttle linkage when you floor it.  Then when you release the pedal
it stays bent of course and the throttle may not close. _That_ can
be exciting I bet! <g>"
