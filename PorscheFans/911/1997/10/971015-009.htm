You really, really, really need to have an experienced mechanic look at
this car for you. I found a 911 on my search that was "love at first sight"
and I almost made the drastic error of buying it. Fortunately, I had the
sense to have a mechanic look at it. It 5 minutes he was pointing out flaws
that I would not have seen for weeks after the sale! I was stunned and
relieved. The 911 I finally bought has been my joy and everything I had
hoped for.

It turned out that the one I bought was far more "ragged" cosmetically than
the one I had "almost" bought, but near mechanically perfect because the PO
had been fanatic about having maintenance done at the dealer. The cosmetics
were cheap and easy to fix (targa top, mirror control and heater buttons,
floor mats, etc.). The car now looks like a million dollars and I know the
body, frame, motor, etc. are in good shape.
