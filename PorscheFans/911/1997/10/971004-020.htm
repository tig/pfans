Hi P-Fans, Mike Klein, and Alan Olson:

Re: Recent thread on tires.

 I am also close to needing tires, and I've considered the same tires Mike
Klein and Alan Olson have mentioned. However, there is a twist to my
situation, and I'm asking for advice.  My back tires are shot, and need
replacement. The PO left me with front tires that are Goodyear NCT's ( OEM, I
believe). The rears are Dunlop D40M2's. ( 205/55-16 front and 225/50-16
rears). I would like to buy rear tires by Goodyear to match the brand name of
the fronts. NCT's are not available. Personal experience with Goodyear GT+4's
on a Talon have been very favorable ( in both U and H speed rating). I
noticed that GT+4's are available in a V speed rating, sized for the Porsche
rears, that are about the same cost as Dunlop D40's. I'm thinking that not
only do they match the brand name of the fronts, but that the "open" tread
may be more suitable to match the tread design of the front's. I'm thinking
that front/rear balance ( tire characteristic-wise) is more important than
ultimate grip in the rear. With my limited slip differential and heavy
understeering characteristic on on-ramps,  I  think I don't need an "ultimate
grip" tire for the rear, as would be the case with SP8000's, FZ50's or D40's.
Thoughts?
