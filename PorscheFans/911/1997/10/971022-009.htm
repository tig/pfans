Hello PorscheFans

I have had the fuel system overhauled and some of the parts replaced and
all was well for about 8 months.  The engine used to "hunt" when warming
up, i.e. it would gently rev up and down until it was warm before the
fuel system was overhauled (for about $350).  I originally thought it
was an impressive feature of the onboard computer and I thought it
sounded elitist but someone set me straight and said "the way to warm up
an engine is with a constant RPM setting not a fluctuating one".  I took
that on board since that's how I warm up an aeroplane before I fly it. 
The same person also said "that car does not have an onboard computer".

The problem is that the engine backfires if the power is applied
anything other than calmly/gently/cautiously for about the first mile. 
I have a Viper alarm on the car with a remote start so every now and
then I remote start it from upstairs and then when I'm ready to go the
car has a warm engine and a cool cabin (I live in the tropics) but I
can't do that after work because the Car Park is away from my office.  A
way to get around the problem is to run it with an idle of around
900-1,000 rpm with air con ON.  This is OK but when it heats up you're
dealing with a tiger and it's not so comfortable pulling up at the
lights with the motor over-revving.

The local dealer said it's OK to get backfires when the engine is cold
but I think there may be another OK to achieve which is no backfires.

Does anyone know anything about this problem.  It's a 3.0 litre '79
motor and I run it on Super (fully leaded).

Thanks
Paul
