Hello all,
    Well....I have been doing my homework on the 911's for some time
now, and I do have a pretty good idea of what I will be looking for when
purchase time comes.  I am probably going to be looking for a circa 1980
911SC...I am probably going to be looking to spend about 13,5k or less. 
I have seen some decent ones out there for as low as around 11k, and
some that are geniunly nice for my price range.  I have access to a
pretty skilled painter, so color isn't going to be the least of an
issue.  Now that I have figured out pretty much of the body/hardware,
most of my concerns are about the interior.
    I haven't gotten too many good looks at the insides of 911SC's, my
questions are, how nice, by any modern standards, is the interior of
these cars.  I know it isn't going to have the insides of a new car, so
I do plan on at least some touching up.  (new seats, etc.)  The seats
and headliner, and other such parts are no trouble at all...a close
friend of the family has an upholstry business so I have good advice on
some such things.  My real questions pertain to the dash, and doors,
etc.  How hard is it to do anything to update the dash, and also fairly
important, how expensive.  I am unsure of the doors as well.  I would
assume that some of it would be relativly simple leather/vinyl work. 
Any pointers for updating the interior would be really appriciated.  
    One other concern I have, is simple curiousity about the best things
to do to beef up the engine.  I know the SSI heat enchangers and a
better exhaust is good for a good bit...everyone say that.  I haven't
heard anyone mention a better intake system as of yet though.  What's
the best one of these cars?
    Well....thanks all for reading.  Hope there are some good answers
out there.

Jeremy
