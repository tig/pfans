    Troy:

    From your description, it sounds as though the car is just
    drifting away from the crown of the road... Perfectly normal
    behavior.

    It isn't... A one-degree difference in caster probably isn't
    even perceptible on the street.

    I don't know your car's factory alignment specs offhand, but I
    suspect that the caster is specified to a tolerance of at least
    +/- half a degree or more... I'd say that things are "OK from a
    practical standpoint".
