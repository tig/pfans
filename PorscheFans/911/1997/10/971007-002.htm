William Cline asked about removing his engine...

Will (I presume)

I removed the engine in my '89 911 to replace the same 
pesky clutch - the process is described nicely in the porsche
manuals - If you can't get a copy, send me an email, and I'll
describe it...

What I did was to fabricate an engine plate to fit snugly to the
bottom of the engine, using 3/4" plywood, about 8" x 16", and 
built up areas to fit onto bottom of the engine block.  

Next, I put the front of the car on ramps, and, using hi-lift jacks,
raised the rear of the car, and supported it on stands.  Then I
used the jacks to lower the engine - Its suprisingly easy 
compared to a front engine/ trans removal - the entire engine-
trans-exhaust stays together!

What simplified my job was to sandwich a dolly between the jack
and the engine plate I made, so that as I lowered the engine, I
could put 4x4's under the dolly wheels, and remove the jack.
Now you're left with an engine sitting on 4x4's - all you do is 
insert a 2x4 *crowbar" under the dolly, and replace the 4x4's 
with 2x4's, and *rock* then dolly down to garage floor level.

At this point, you've got your engine on a dolly, and you can
wheel it around the garage - very handy.  I had to remove the 
rear valance panel to allow the engine to slide under, but that's
all!  It took me and a buddy about 12 beers to complete the 
entire removal.

One more tip - remember to clean out the center of the cv-joint
allan bolts before you remove them, so that the wrench fits 
all the way to the bottom - you don't want to round these out!

I don't think you want to wait for it to explode (and it will...) I did,
on a full throttle upshift from first to second, and I think it caused
undue trauma on the trans...

hope this helps...
