Congratulations on your purchase! 3.2s are amazing automobiles!

I'll answer your 2nd question first: This "noise" is normal just as the
dealer said. Every 911 I've driven does it. After you've owned your 911
a while you'll learn how to avoid making it happen.

Now for your 1st question about valve guide wear:

You know what valves are right? They sit at the top of the cylinder head
and either let fuel/air in or exhaust out. On most engines, including
the 911 engines, the valves are shaped something like a bar stool...a
long thin stem with a round disc on one end. The disc fills in a hole at
the top of the cylinder head, sealing it off. The camshaft, being driven
by the timing chains, has lobes on it (cams) which smack the end of the
valve stem at the right time during engine rotation, causing the disc to
move into the cylinder. This allows either fuel/air or exhaust to
enter/exit the cylinder (because the disc is no longer sealing the
hole).

The valves sit within tubes which on most engines (including ours) have
some sort of a lining that reduces friction and wear. Normally the valve
stems fit perfectly in the guides so that there is no lateral movement.
They can slide in and out as the cams smack them, but not side to side.
Valve guide wear means that this lining (or in some extreme cases the
valve stems themselves!) has worn and the stems are allowed to move side
to side. 

A car with worn valve guides will make obvious "ticking" noises that
increase in frequency with an increase in RPMs. The ticking is the sound
of the stems hitting the walls of the valve guides. As you can imagine,
once it starts it continues to get worse and worse over time (the more
play there is, the harder the stems hit, and the harder they hit the
more wear they cause). Eventually you can break a valve stem which
generally causes a catestrophic engine failure. Short term you'll get a
little performance decrease and and increase in oil consumption.

All valve guides wear over time. My research on the topic indicates that
wear bad enough to cause "ticks" that occurs under 100K miles or so is
abnormal.

Note that just because your car "ticks" does not mean you have worn
valve guides. It could be that your valves are just misadjusted and you
need a valve adjustment. When the wrench is doing the valve adjustment
he can tell pretty easily if there is a wear problem...he simply tries
to get the valves to move side to side with his fingers.

How do I know this? Sigh. I was fortunate enough to find an '88 Carrera
with 8600 miles on it this spring. Unfortunately, for no apparent
reason, this car has *very* abnormal valve guide wear even though it has
less than 10K miles on it. I discovered this after having the dealer
perform 2 valve adjustments to get rid of the "tick". During the 2nd
adjustment they found that several of my valves were loose in their
guides. It will cost roughly $3500 to fix. Painful.

There have been many stories, including reports from Bruce Anderson the
famous magazine writer, of 3.2 Carreras with premature valve guide wear.
He's never personally seen one with less than 30000 miles on it, so I
think I've set a record. My correspondence with Porsche on the subject
has been inconclusive about whether they consider it to be a
design/manufacturing defect or not (although I have worked out a deal
with my dealer and Porsche so that a not-insignificant part of repair
will be covered by them, you can read into this whatever you want).
