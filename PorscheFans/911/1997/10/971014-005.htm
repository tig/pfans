Pfans
I belive my starter has decided to take the dirt nap.  For the last couple
of weeks it's been making death rattles when I start the car - sounds like
it's shearing teeth.  Finally it refused to even turn and I had to push
start it.  There's plenty of electrical power and once started it runs like
a champ, so I figured it was just gone.  After two days of push starts it
decided to turn, again with the death-rattle sound - like there's only a
couple of teeth left.  I was convinced that it was the starter until it
started to turn again.  Could it be that it's getting intermittent power,
causing the noisy symptoms I described, or is it a little of both?
Something else I noticed was what sounded like a relay going nuts under the
dash on the passenger side.

Anyone have any advice?  I'm planning on tackling this myself, but it looks
like changing the starter is a drop-the-engine job which has me a little
nervous, and the fact that it's now turning again (albeit noisily) has me
doubting my diagnosis.

TIA
Mark
