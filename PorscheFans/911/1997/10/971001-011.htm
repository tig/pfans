I'm trying to post this again - for some reason it didn't take
it when I used my groupwise mailer.  So this one's from a
standard UNIX mailer.

Well apparently there are a few other people with SCs that have
this problem!  I received plenty of email about my post
regarding a brake warning light that is always on.  Several
people asked for a summary to the list.  Here is a summary of
the suggestions I received:

1) Momentarily disconnect the ground to the battery and then reconnect.

2) Reset switch on master cylinder (apparently accessed with
some difficulty from beneath the car).  Here is a description
from John Kolego, sig line said 76 911S and 87 Carrera so may
or may not apply to SC:

     >"If you crank your wheels to the right and flash a light along the axle
     >(where the shroud protecting the steering stuff is) there is a space where
     >you can see the MC. If you look closely you will see a clear nylon
     >nipple, about the size of a ballpoint pens tip, sticking out of a nylon
     >plastic cap." 
     >
     >"Use a flat blade screwdriver or other blunt reach extender, and push
     >that puppy in."

3) Could be related to oil pressure switch problem.

Seeking the easy fix first I disconnected the battery ground
and reconnected it.  If you decide to try this you may want to
cover the bullhorn for your alarm before reconnecting, or at
least move your head a few inches away from it.  That did the
trick!  I have driven it for three days now w/o recurrence.  I
didn't get a chance to look into 2) or 3) so am not sure if
they work or not.  2) was a very popular response.

Several people reported problems with this light if their
master cylinder reservoir got low but not empty, even just half
full.  Mine did get down to about half full during bleeding so
this may have been the cause.  Others reported a recurrence of
the problem at later times even after resetting the switch or
disconnecting the battery ground.

Thanks to Terry Shugart, David Ferguson, Tom Smith, David
Buhain, Bill, Ed Yourkovich, Brad Maker, John Kolego, Ray
Calvo, and Ed Mellinger for their responses.
