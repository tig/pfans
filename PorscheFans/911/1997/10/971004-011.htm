For Henry Watts of Sunnyvale (whose e-mail address I regret I didn't save) or 
anyone else with views on this subject...
Henry, you commented in a recent piece on your 2.4S' engine lubrication that 
you used AN-16 fittings "where turns needed to be made to get to the front oil 
cooler."  I'm researching the installation of a cooler on my perfectly stock 73.5 
CIS which has an annoying tendency to register 250° during slaloms/drivers ed 
events. 
Bruce Anderson says to be sure that the oil lines to the cooler are "big enough." 
Presumeably "big enough" has a lot to do with the car, where it is used, and its 
state of tune. But I gather you think that using fittings as large as AN-16 (and 
probably the hose size that goes with them) is important for adequate flow? Did 
you do this all the way through the car or just at some difficult bends? If the 
fitting sizes on the coolers themselves are any indication, most manufacturers 
seem to think AN 8-12 fittings are adequate. I'd be interested in your views. Jim 
Taylor,  73.5
