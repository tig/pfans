Howard - the widest wheels that will fit on a 1970 911
are 7X15.  I have seen cars that were able to use the
sevens on both front and rear, which is nice for tire
rotation.  There are other factors which will affect
this.  They are ride height, suspension stiffness, 
camber setting, and tire size.  Lower ride height may
make it difficult to fit the wider wheels.  Stiffer
suspension will be better.  More negative camber is
better.  You may be able to fit 205's without rubbing
but not 225's.  The best setup that I've seen with the
stock fenders is 7X15 wheels all around, 225 width tires,
lowered, with stiff torsion bars, and at least 1 degree of
negative camber.  You will get incredible handling with
this setup.  Hope this helps!
