Hello P-Fans,

I'm looking at seats to put in my 911 to help out when I do
driver ed programs. I want a seat that has shoulder harness
slots and still is fully reclining ( I still use the car on
the street and want access to the rear for items such as
coolers and children :-) So far I have found the Recaro
SRD, the Sparco Supersport, and the Cobeau GT7. I would
like to hear from people about their experience with these
seats - are they comfortable, do they hold you, what is the
quality like, etc. I know Recaro and Sparco are good brands
but are they twice as good as the Cobeau's since they cost
twice as much? Any opinions or advice welcome.


PS - If you have any for sale drop me a note as well.

Thanks
Todd Meisner
