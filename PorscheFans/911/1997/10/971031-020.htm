My experience with both front and rear windows is that the leaks occur 
when the windshield is not installed with the butyleen-sealer(I was told  
the Porsche -factory uses a lot when installing it in a brand new car),
or the metal strip in the rubber came loose(in a corner or so).
I had a water-leak on the front windshield in the left corner and the 
rear-windshield on both left and right corners.
It appeared that the front windshield was replaced and installed without 
enough sealer,and on the rear the metal-strip(black trim often 
called)was the problem.
Took both windshields out,used 3Msealer(autoglass sealer 3830E,here 
in Holland) and reinstalled them.
Caution:if you remove the metal strip of the rubber(like I did),you have 
to reinstall the window!I tried to put it back in but didn't work.
If you have a small leak I would suggest to lift the rubber a little and put 
as much of that butyleen-sealer underneath it as you can.
If it doesn't solve the water leak,you have at least one day of work 
ahead of you,but that's the fun of a 911,can't get angry on the thing!!!
