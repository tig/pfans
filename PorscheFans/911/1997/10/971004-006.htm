I was there in July, and yes there is a Museum at the factory in 
Stuttgart, it is just off one of the U-Bhan exits, very handy.  It has 
some great cars in it but they are crammed into a very small space.  
There are factory tours available, but only for groups, and they have 
to be arranged well in advance.  They have a video tape that they run
but it was not working when we were there. There is no charge to get 
into the museum, and it is located where customers taking factory 
delivery pick up their new cars, so the machinery in the parking lot 
alone makes it worth the trip!  The is a number listed in the phone 
book for them I think, and all the museums run abbreviatted hours
during the off season, so I would call first. 

The Mercedes museum is in Stuttgart as well, and worth a look,
even if, like me, you aren't a big fan of the marque.  It is huge, and 
has more cars, some dating back 100 yrs!  It is free as well, but 
best reached by bus or taxi. 

If you are in Munich, check out the BMW museum, it has some 
great stuff too.  They normally have factory tours for the public, but 
in July they were retrofitting or something so they weren;t doing 
them then.  It cost ~5 marks ($3) to get into the museum, but worth 
it if you appreciate fine cars/bikes.  It is easy to find, kiddie corner
from the olympic park.  

I don't know of any other Porsche related stuff, but enjoy the food 
and drink, it is incredible!
