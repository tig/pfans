I need a little help on my 1981 SC Coupe.  I have what would be 
descrobed as the standard Hot statrting problem with the the CIS car. 
I ran the complete fuel system pressure check and determined that 
everything was in spec except for the rest pressure which goes to 
zero in less than 30 seconds.  I have replaced the fuel pump and 
check valve with no improvment in rest pressure situation.  To get 
around the problem fro the time being, I have disconnected the air 
flow sensor switch so that the fuel pump starts when I turn on the 
ignition.  This makes for much quicker starting in most conditions.  
I will continue to chase the rest pressure problem.  

Even with the fuel pump on with the ingnition, the starting is very 
slow when the air temperatue is hot especially when the P car is 
parked in a sunny spot even after 3 or 4 hours of not running.  Is 
there something I should be looking at?  Seems like a temperature 
sensing problem.

My mechanic suggests that I repalace the fuel accumulator next, but 
that was qualified with "because that is the cheaper part"

When I say hoat weather, I am talking upper 80s to lower 90s.  This 
is northern New Jersey summer weather.  My P car sat for two years 
unused prior to my purchase in Jan 97.  It had 33k mi on it then.  It 
now has 45k
