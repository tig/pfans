I agree. The real point is that the early 911's are very different from the SC's,
Carrera's, 964, 993 cars and shouldn't be considered as a 'cheap' version of the 
newer ones. Heating, AC, power, noise, seats, bla, bla, bla are rather crude by 
today's standards and if the goal is to have a 993 Turbo, an early 911 will  be a 
major disappointment.

I agree again. My *other* car is a Volvo 240. Combining that with the 911 as a
'hobby' car cut my tag to $20/year and insurance to about $40/month. But it still
needs to be maintained so you are paying to keep up two cars, maybe not twice
as much as one really nice one but it is a real expense to plan for. 

Thanks for the feedback
