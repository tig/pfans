in response to leaky windows...I just had my windows redone today

due to water in my rubber seals....I was getting glass fog  (smokey film) in

window laminate...the glass shop said the cheap fix would be to fill the area

with sealer,,,the proper way would be to remove the rubber and reseal....this

is what I opted to do since I was concerned bout corrrosion in the frame...

luckily there was none and we resealed with new rubber as mine is 10 yrs. old

and lacked resiliency..which I think caused the problem in the first place...
cost just under 500.00 bucks but it gave me peace of mind..(no rust and did not
want the smokey film to spread)... if you elect to go the whole route make sure
you use genuine porsche rubber as I've heard that after market seals don't
fit as well...

mine  also has the antenna inthe windshield ,,did not want the wires to corrode.

it's your call which way to go but in anycase stopthe seepage of water
which can't be good for glass or metal or interiors for that matter...and
they are supposed to use a sealer also,,my shop did under the rubber and on
the outside seam...also did the rear glass as the plasic frame in the
rubber was getting warped do to age.....

hope this helps...aloha,,,,merlin   87'  930
