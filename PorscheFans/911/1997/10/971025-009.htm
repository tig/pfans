Hi Gabriel, and fellow pfans!  Disconnecting the oxy sensor?  One major
effect of disconnecting your oxy sensor is horrendous gas  consumption and a
"plugged up" cat.  I can suck through a half tank in 50 miles if I forget to
re-connect my sensor after a day at the track.  My '87 had the automotion
"stage 1" chip (more on this in a minute), no cat (straight pipe) and the
SSI exhaust system from the headers on back.  Obviously, this is basically a
track car that sees street driving only to and from the track...  At the
track, I'd play around with disconnecting the sensor which essentially dumps
gas into the system.  If I'm driving really hard, it seemed to help a tiny
bit.  (This at BIR where really hard is *really* foot to the floor stuff.)
Or, it may be one of those "voodoo" things that really has no effect beyond
the psychological one.  Word from one of my favorite wrenches was that with
the chip and the straight pipe, I *might* feel some gain if I'd disconnect.
But, to remain legal in Club Racing, the automotion chip was removed, and my
sense was, with the stock chip, no gain with the sensor disconnect.  All I
saw was that fuel gage needle heading south!  (And to add "fuel" to the chip
fire:  I saw little if any benefit to the chip.  Shoved my rev limiter up a
notch, but no real gain beyond being able to keep my foot in it just a tick
longer.  For the cost, which the PO paid, I'd put my money into *driver*
improvements!)  teresa.
