Thank you to everyone who responded to my post concerning timing.  I
must say that the answers varied considerably.  Some answers indicated
that since the factory had experimented with ignition timing as much as
+/- 5 degrees that some leeway was acceptable given that total advance
at 6000RPM did not exceed 38 degrees.  One person suggested that this
type of experimenting was akin to Russian roullette with hand grenades.
After further consideration, I believe that an accurate assesment.  I
experimented with timing on a vehicle that I turbocharged, but in that
case there was no giant engine fan to mask the barely audible
detonation.  Before I abandoned this 911 timing experiment, I did find
significantly more performance with 28 degrees BTDC @ 4000RPM with no
noticeable ill effects.  What I can't notice worries me, so the car is
set at 25 degrees BTDC.

Lately I have seen a thread about ARCO.  In my area SUNOCO 94 is
available, which is what I use unless I don't plan well and have to use
93.  My 83 Euro SC has 9.8:1 compression (the reason for my caution with
ignition timing).  What is the WEB Wisdom on fuel choice?

For anyone who is interested, I put together a compilation of everything
I was sent on valve adjustment as well as my experiences.  If anyone is
interested it is in a Word document, so you should request it directly.

Thanks again for the help.
