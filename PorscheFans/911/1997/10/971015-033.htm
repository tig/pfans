Bill Favors restored his engine and tranny in a 69E, and has an oil leak
(drip on floor type) at the flywheel end of engine which he says is from
the valve covers (otherwise unspecified).

Bill - you say you replaced your valve covers with "new style" covers. 
If they were not actually new as in unused, I suggest you take off all the
covers you think are leaking, and see how true the mating surfaces are. 
Ham handed ignoramuses like me over the years have typically tried to
stop leaks by tightening the nuts more.  This warps the covers.  Even the
"turbo" covers are not immune.  Put them on a true flat surface (or
reasonable approximation thereof) and see if they rock.  Usually the
ends are turned up a bit.  A machine or woodworking shop with a big
belt sander they are willing to use on mag/alu can true them up, and I
suppose they could be dusted in a mill.

I like to use the blue Hypalon gasket dressing if I am reusing old gaskets
which look a bit compressed (I'm cheap), as it seems to fill small
irregularities just fine, and doesn't harden, so you can get it off when
you want to do that, or smear it around on reuse, etc.  But you shouldn't
have to use anything if the surfaces are true and the gaskets are new
(or new enough), and if they are much out of true, nothing you'd really
want to use is apt to help.  But maybe someone will chime in with
something which has worked fine for them.

  I asked an IMSA racing buddy why he was not using the turbo covers
on his potent engine in his really tricked out car, and he said the old mag
covers were lighter (certainly true, though not a whole lot), and worked
just fine if you treated them right.  

You should know Bruce A cautions against using any dressing goop on
gaskets, especially these, as it can lubricate and allow the gasket to
squish out from its intended position, making things much worse than
they otherwise might be.  this, however, has not happened to me despite
my occasional disobedience of the commandments.  I think the valve
cover gaskets are stiff enough and secured enough by the studs that
they resist this kind of movement.  Double gasketing is what the
356/914/4 crowd sometimes have to do, because those seals are really
poorly designed.  Not a 911 trick - the gaskets are too thin and
incompressible to "fix" a warped valve cover, it seems to me, and
slipping or getting sucked out of place (leading to biiig leaks) doesn't
happen to us lucky 911 owners, despite the leaks we do have.

While you have the covers off, check the rocker shafts where you think
the leaks are to see if they are the culprits.  I've now forgotten to tighten
a shaft twice over my years of messing with these - some distraction
comes up.  Oil is the first sign before they work so loose that you have
noise or damage.  If they are tight and just leaking anyway, one wrench
friend uses gasgacinch:  pull the shaft out and clean all oil off shaft and
holes, put back in part way, put the goop (not much needed) on the end
of the shaft sticking out from the groove out.  Daub some into the open
hole, push shaft into final position, and tighten.  that way you will (may?)
get some of this good stuff in where you need it, and you will not get any
in by the rocker arm, where you don't want it.  He swears by it, and all I
will say is that I have used it and not messed anything up - shafts are
easy enough to remove again, haven't screwed up rocker oiling, etc. 
You can do this with engine in car with some ingenuity and patience.  
One of the machine shops which advertises in Pano a year or so ago
recommended upping the torque on well used cam holders with holes
slightly buggered up to get the seal.  But this can lead to permanent
expansion of the shaft ends, which means they scrape a bit when
pushed through the rocker arm bushing, which isn't good either.
