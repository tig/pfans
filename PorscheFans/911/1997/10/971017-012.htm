After a long absence I thought that I would post my experiences with my search 
and potential purchase of a 911.  I apologize for taking up the time and 
space, however, some people on this list had requested that I let them know 
how my search for a 911 ended.    
I went to the dealer with every intention of buying my dream car after a 6 
month search.  My dream car, a silver 1988 coupe with a blue interior and no 
whale tail, was finally discovered.  The car had only 44K miles on it and was 
in perfect condition.  The dealer is a reputable used car dealer for Porsche's 
and Ferrari's and has a good reputation.  He basically buys cars from original 
owners by low-balling them when they offer their cars for sale and then sells 
them at his dealership.  
When I arrived at the dealership and started the car it smoked A LOT when I 
first started it.  The car smoked (white smoke, not blue) for about two or 
three minutes and then stopped.  The dealer claimed that the smoke was due to 
the fact that he moves the cars around the lot frequently without driving them 
much.  The dealer claimed to be unaware of any valve guide problems with the 
3.2 which I was considering to be the source of the smoke.  After driving the 
car I found it to be rather slow and performing poorly.  I drove other 911's 
on the lot that same day and they all seemed to be considerably faster than 
the car I wanted.  The dealer told me to take the car out for as long as I 
wanted and I did.  After a nice 30 minute drive through a twisty country road 
I returned to the dealer and told him to hold the car so that I could arrange 
for a mechanic to inspect the car.  
As I drove home from the dealer I started to think (a bad thing to do) about 
my potential major purchase and I started to worry.  First, I was worried 
about spending about 5K more than I really planned on spending.  I felt better 
knowing that I as going to get a rather high trade-in value on my 1992 BMW and 
that the dealer was charging a "fair" $28,500 for the Porsche.  Secondly, I 
was worried about maintenance; specifically the cost of it.  The dealer 
claimed that a well maintained 3.2 911 for the most part needs only oil and 
that the car can easily go 250K miles, however, my BMW dealer said the same 
thing about my car and I average 1K-2K a year in repair bills.  After  a long 
night contemplating my purchase I chickened out.  Worried that I was possibly 
getting myself into a potential money pit with buying a used car, and that my 
wife's college loans really should get my extra money, I called the dealer 
early the next morning and informed him that I would pass on the car.  Oh 
well, at least I have my BMW.  Sorry again about taking up the space on the 
forum.
