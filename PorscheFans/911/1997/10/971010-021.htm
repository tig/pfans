Every once in a while the alarm system in my '91 C2 goes off 
unexpectedly.  What I have recently discovered is that since I have 
owned the car I'm not sure that it has ever armed properly.  Can one of 
you 964 (993) owners confirm the correct flashing of the alarm 
indicator for me?  When I lock a door with the key after about 10 
seconds and the LED goes into a "double flash" mode (dot-dot-dash).  
From reading the owner's manual this indicates the alarm system is not 
armed properly.  Can someone describe to me how the alarm indicators 
flash when the system is properly armed?

I've gone through the trunk, engine compartment and glove box switches 
and they seem OK.  Haven't felt like tackling the CD player switches 
yet.  It is interesting to note that even though the alarm indicates it 
is not properly armed it is still functioning.  I taped over the hood 
switch, armed the system and then removed the tape.  The alarm went off.

The alarm system is a diagnosable component so presumably the fault 
code is stored in the alarm/central locking control unit.  Oh, for want 
of a Hammer...
