Hi Jeff -

Mine's definitely factory... there's an option code for it on the build
plate in the front trunk.  One of the 911 books (Frere?  Anderson?)
lists all the codes though not necessarily by year.   

Mine is the "Turbo" tail, the second one they put on the Turbo as I
understand, when they needed to make room for the intercooler.  Also
called the "tea tray", it is large, the upper surface is flat and
parallel to the ground, and the rubber lip has a pronounced vertical
"fence" on the sides and rear.   This is different than the >84 Carerra
tail, which was a little closer to the original "whale tail" styling.  I
recall reading (Frere again, I think) that the Tea Tray is the most
effective of the 911 spoilers (at least until the 3.6 RSR came along),
and actually generates a little downforce at very high speeds (most of
'em just kill the upforce).  I don't know if other spoilers were
available as factory options on the SCs.

Don't know if you are after looks or performance.  Performance-wise, I
can't give you lap times, but I find that you begin to feel aero effects
anywhere above 60 mph, especially if there are crosswinds.  The spoiler
moves the center of pressure back closer to the center of gravity, which
increases the aerodynamic stability, which makes the car feel like it is
"arrowing" down the road, with less of the dancing around that
un-spoilered 911s do at speed in a straight line.  You can feel this
above 60, and it is a very nice thing indeed above 90 or 100.  On the
down side, the thing weighs 50 pounds or so, and it is Out Back and Up
High, which you may have heard me rant about previously.   It exacts a
significant penalty at second gear, auto-x type speeds where aero
doesn't count and polar moment does.  So the benefit depends on your
application.  I'm lucky enough to have a commute where I can routinely
cruise at 75, and blast up to 120 a couple times a week when the road is
empty... and there's usually a 15-25 mph direct crosswind... so I put my
spoilers back on, despite objections from the better half ("that thing
looks like a cat in heat!").
