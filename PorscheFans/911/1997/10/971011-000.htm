I talked to a Director of the GGR PCA recently about this subject, and she 
said mounting lap or sub belt to the original, factory lap belt anchor 
points is not allowed, at least in GGR Time Trials.  Something about all 
harness mounting points have to anchor directly to the body of the car, and 
that the original lap belt mounted to the seat frame or seat rail, which is 
not considered the same as "directly to the body" of the car.  At least 
this applied to her '92 C2, in which she said she had to drill directly in 
the floor for the lap and sub belts!

It sounds like the legality of any "non-drill" anchoring idea ultimately 
depends on the opinion of the particular sanctioning body's safety person. 
 Speaking of which, who is the GGR's final word on legality of safety 
equipment, anyway?  I don't want to invest in creative non-drilling 
alternatives only to be barred from running at GGR events.  Myself, I'm 
leaning toward a six-point harness where you can sit on the two sub-belts 
which are anchored to the original lap belt mounting points, assuming this 
is allowed in GGR.

TIA,
Bob

Subject: 	Sub strap idea - feedback please

Re-post due to list not sent Oct 7,8
Hello,

A little while ago there was a thread about harness hookup
in cars. Generally it seemed that the shoulder harness and
lap belts were no problem but the sub strap was more
difficult. I felt nobody came up with a really good way to
fasten the sub straps without drilling a hole in the car
floor. I've been thinking about this and have come up with
an idea that I would like some feedback on. Here it goes
.......

1/ remove the seat rails

2/ replace the rails with 1/4 " spacers under them. Use
appropriately  longer grade 8.8 bolts.

3/ use a sub strap with two try down points

4/ pass a try down point through the 1/4" space under the
seat rails

5/ connect the harness to the same points as the lap belts

To my way of thinking this should even meet SCCA rules and
yet require no holes to be drilled. The only downside is
that you loose a 1/4" of head room. What's the consensus ?
