James, you wrote

.... But I gather you think that using fittings as large as
AN-16 (and 
probably the hose size that goes with them) is important
for adequate flow? Did 
you do this all the way through the car or just at some
difficult bends? If the 
fitting sizes on the coolers themselves are any indication,
most manufacturers 
seem to think AN 8-12 fittings are adequate

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

911 need AN16 fittings and 3/4 " ID lines throughout the
system. Remember that 911 engines are oil cooled once the
air cooling woun't keep up. We flow much more oil than any
non air/oil cooled engine. That's also part of why we have
10 -12 liters of oil. If you used smaller lines than this
you would basically create a restriction in the oil system
and reduce much needed oil flow to the cooler.
