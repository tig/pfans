A nice post, and well thought-out, but there are a couple of points in here I
disagree with.

> 1) What is a car in excellent condition worth, use the "Excellence" prices 
> as a guide find the  years/models that the 'good' to 'excellent' cars are 
> in your price range. 

First point of disagreement... I think the Excellence prices aren't entirely
accurate. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, Bruce Anderson also thinks so, since
he's soliciting reports of recent purchases and their prices. A better,
albiet more specialized/pricey source of data is Phil Van BusKirk's Porsche
Market Letter. Unfortunately, the early model 911 newsletter went by a couple
of months ago, but maybe you can get a back copy from someone. Regardless,
it's got a *lot* of listings for most every model Porsche, and you can get a
fair idea of the price spread. Word of warning though, the listings seem to
be West Coast-centric, and particularly heavily weighted to the California
market.

Thought number 2 on this issue. There really are at least two levels of 911
pricing in my experience. You've got the low milage, garage queen, potential
concours car. This car will cost. Lots. And if you plan to actually drive it,
it's wasted money. If you look long enough though, you can luck into the
cosmetically imperfect, high-milage-but-well-kept daily driver type car. If
it really has been well looked after, and you are willing to overlook some
minor dents you can pick up a really fun car for a fair price. I wanted a
semi-daily driver/autocross car, and I looked at a lot of $25-30K low-milage
mid-80s Carreras. A *lot* of them. I finally found a 115K mile '87 Targa for
$20K. A minor dent in the hood, and it needed about $1000 of "new owner" work
to get it satisfactory, but it's been running great ever since(except for the
*&$! starter solenoid... but that's in the past now).

> (9k is going to be late 60's or early 70's T or E). Do you really want a car 
>older than you are?

For a well maintained vehicle, age itself doesn't have to be a bad thing. Just
keep in mind that he chances of recouping the repair costs is a lot smaller
on the older cars. And *do* find out what shape the car is in now *BEFORE*
you buy it.
 
> If it is a project car you will need  two cars, one to fix and one to use. 
> Can you afford BOTH cars insurance, tags, oil changes, etc?

Here's another spot where I'll disagree. If you can swing it, buy a second
car regardless. Preferably cheap and reliable. Why? Because you can save cash
on your insurance this way. My wife is insured as a primary driver on our 944
turbo(the *other* 944), and I'm insured as the primary on our 911 and our
142. Splitting the duty between the 911 and the 142 saves me several hundred
a year on a car that only costs me ~$50/year to register. Sure, driving the
car costs, but it's cheaper by the mile than the miles I *don't* drive in the
911 as a result. But buy a second car that sits well... because you probably 
won't drive it much. :)
