    Warren:

    In my defense, I DID preface my recommendation with "if you're as
    brave/stupid as I am"... And I recommended a tire repair kit
    (reamer, hook, rubber plugs, and glue) as an alternative.

    I've only used the stuff once (actually, it WAS during a
    snowstorm), and it didn't cause any permanent balance problems,
    but you're right... It's not the best solution by any means. 

    The tire repair kits work better and are nearly as fast... The
    only problem is that you need a source of air to inflate the
    tire after you've repaired it.

    The BIG danger with Fix-A-Flat type products is that when they
    were originally introduced, they used an explosive gas that could
    injure someone trying to patch the tire... If sparks were
    generated when the guy reamed out the hole in a steel-belted
    tire, the gas would explode.

    The Fix-A-Flat formulations were changed after the first reports
    of injuries, but if you have a really old can of the stuff lying
    around, you might want to read the label and make sure that it
    specifically says that it's non-explosive.
