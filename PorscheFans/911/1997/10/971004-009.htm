Red Line 75W90, 75W90 NS, 80W140 and 75W140 NS are all rated GL 5+ which is
required in 911's. From Red Line literature:

"MTL can be used in most manual transmissions and transaxles for both street
and racing use unless the manufacturer reqwuires the additional protection
of an SAE 90 or the extreme-pressure protection of a GL-5. In those
situations the MT 90 (GL-4) or 75W90NS (GL-5) will provide good shiftability
and synchro compatibility and extra gear protection."


and...

"Red Line 75W90 Gear Oil provides excellent protection in nearly all
differentials, conventional and limited slip, in both racing and street use.
75W90NS and 75W140NS can be used inn certain limited-slip units in racing to
lock-up the differential. 80W140 should be used in commercial hauling ,
problem limited slip units, racing applications which see tremendous torque
at low speeds, and where noise deadening is desired."

Red Line 75W90NS will work with a limited slip (clutch type) unit. The
reason Red Line doesn't steer you in that direction is that use of this oil
may produce some Limited Slip "Chatter". The "Chatter" is caused by the
clutch type limited slip grabbing. Many racers will put up with the noise to
get better limited slip action. The friction modifier, whether the GM
additive or the Red Line 75W90 that also contains a friciton modifier, makes
the gear oil more slippery and therefore eliminates the grabbing that
casuses the "chatter". With transaxles we really have a tough job for a gear
oils. For best synchro engagement we want something not too slippery. The
differential wants something real slippery. Sooooo.....for non-limited slip
cars I'd use the 75W90NS...good synchro engagementand we don't have to worry
about "chatter"." On limited slip cars it's up to you, if you want the best
lock up of your limited slip on the track and can live with some potential
"chatter" go with the 75W90NS. On strictly street cars equipped with limited
slip I'd go with the 75W90.
