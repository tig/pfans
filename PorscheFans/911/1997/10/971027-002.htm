The original leather dash in my '81 SC is still ok, however,  it exhibits some 
shrinkage tension, and although the stitches are pulling a bit, they are still 
holding. The car has the full leather interior with leather pretty much 
everywhere. However, the driver's seat is showing its age, and has a little 
wear from my big butt...
	 I have owned the car for 13 years and have put leather 
protectant/moisturizer on it at least four times a year. In fact I should do 
it again about now... I am a strong believer in a goopy, oderiferous product 
made by Connolly Leather in the UK, called Hide Food. It looks like lard, and 
is made from "natural animal oils" (sorry all you vegans). After cleaning the 
leather with a damp sponge, I carefully smear a light coat of this stinky slop 
on the whole interior about twice a year (sounds like fun, huh?) and just use 
regular old Armorall a couple of other times. I occasionally have used saddle 
soap on the car as well. This plan seems to do the trick, despite the fact 
that the car has been in FL all its life, baking in the sun and mouldering in 
the humidity. I get compliments on the interior regularly, and it still has a 
leather-y smell, which I attribute to the Hide Food. The HF costs about $18 a 
jar, and I find a jar lasts me about two years. I also have another car with 
leather seats (but not dash!). Oh yes, and did I mention the garage? yeah, I 
do keep it in there. That makes all the difference in the world, I think. 
	By the way, does anyone know what percentage of SC's were made with this full 
leather interior treatment?  I have no idea, but have not seen too many SC's 
with it. 
No, kids, I have nothing to do with promoting use of Hide Food! (But they 
should send me five bucks for the plug, right?)      Warren C.
