I agree with the sentiment that drilled (rather than cast) rotors (fronts,
anyway) are not a good deal.  If you get a year or so of driver's ed out
of them without cracking enough that they have to be replaced, you are
doing well.  after second set I gave up. Drilled rears on same street race
car, however, are doing fine - I think I put them on in 88 or 89.  They look
like they will wear out before they crack.  

However, it seems a bit much to say that drilled rotors per se are a
safety hazard.  I usually discovered my cracks at tech inspection a week
 and a half before a DE event (as we do it in these parts so we have
some time to fix things), or just while putting the track tires on.  Once,
when I decided cracks weren't that bad and ran anyway,  they got
worse at the event, but announced themselves with a thumping under
braking which couldn't be ignored by anyone, even me, long before they
cracked so far that they were in danger of braking off large parts and
locking up a wheel.  Of course, I had a spare to hand.  

Cracking can easily enough occur on non-drilled plain rotors.  A friend
borrowed my spare rotor just this last weekend because that happened
to him, and then had to scrounge another one because he found the
other side was worse - crack went from outer rotor rim all the way to
the edge of the hat in one place, and on both sides.  From this I conclude
that safety lies in looking at ALL rotors for cracks (especially in hopped
up cars), and just giving special attention to drilled ones, maybe taking off
the wheel at tech.  When the hairline incipient cracks start joining up,
connecting the dots, it's probably time for a change.

Good to know that some region or regions maybe go a bit overboard in
this area, though.  One more thing to ask about if visiting someone else's
venue.  Easy to fix, because it is shortsighted if running drilled rotors not
to have some plain ones along as spares.  They will  eventually crack in
the front if driven on the track, that much is certain.

To bad the cast hole rotors are so expensive.
