....This will be lengthy, but Walt Fricke sent me a personal email that I
thought the list might find informative:

For valve adjustment use the Z1 mark (but check it out carefully by
cleaning the pulley if needed, use a small mirror, whatever).  Your fan
housing strap may have a decal on it indicating what is what. 

However, you should use a belt and suspenders method.  All you need
to adjust any valve is to be sure that the rocker arm is bearing on the
cam base circle and not on any part of the ramp/lobe.  The base circle
covers quite a bit of the cam, so you don't have to be at any exact place
on it for any given valve.  So, look in at the cam - good light and again
maybe a mirror (I have gotten spoiled with racing engines I have out so
often I usually do this stuff on an engine stand) and rotate the crank
observing what is and is not the base circle - the part where the valve is
fully closed.  Think of it:  both valves are closed through most of the
compression stroke and most of the power stroke (which means it
doesn't really matter if your second mark is ATDC or BTDC by 5 or 10
degrees).  In addition, this is the part where you can wiggle the lifter,
though that alone is too risky a test, because you might just be starting or
ending up on the lobe part.  Anyway, get both covers off on one side
(perhaps the left if yo have air), set to Z1 or what you think is Z1, and
see if you can wiggle both rockers on the #1 cylinder.  If so, you are at
Z1 or close enough.  If you can't  wiggle either (or only one), I think you
are at Z1 for #4 (on the other bank), where you will be able to wiggle
both.  If you have all 4 covers off, check to see if both on #4 will wiggle. 
You can use the distributor mark in this way also - when the rotor is
near the mark, #1 should have both valves fully closed.  

Bottom line - positioning the crank for valve adjustment is not something
which has to be done with the sort of precision needed to set the ignition
timing (or worse, the cam timing, which you will not need to do unless
rebuilding the engine).  You need to get it right, but it is easy to do so
because you have a broad window.

Once you have identified a close enough TDC for #1 (or #4, for that
matter), then you can just use the pulley marks for the rest, with just the
wiggle test for confirmation.  the other 2 marks, spaced out 120 degrees
apart, on the pulley, have no ambiguity.  If you had a way of measuring
this spacing, that would be another empirical way of telling Z1 from the
spark timing mark near it.  I have this stuff memorized for my 2.7 and
earlier pulleys, but can't remember if the 3.0s (one of which I have but
have not had to work this seriously on) have the timing mark to the right
of Z1 or vice versa.

Also, if you are going to be doing your own tune-ups, invest in one of the
little spec books.  Automotion and others list these in their catalogs, and
you can get the one for your engine - $8-10 each.  Compact and gives
lots of useful stuff, along with stuff (like exact bearing journal
dimensions on the crank) you probably won't have much use for. 
Because it is specific for your car (I think there is one for 78-9 Scs,
another for 80-83s), it is probably more trustworthy than Haynes.

Good luck, and don't be intimidated by the task.  It's pretty simple, but
enough work that you won't be doing it every other weekend just for the
fun of it.  More like every few oil changes if you are diligent, I'd wager.

My answer....

....thanks for the info. With all that I have read on valve adjustments
(Haynes, Clymer, Panorama's Upfixin series, PorscheFans postings) you
provided some unique words. I have now finished my adjusting (just yesterday,
glad it's raining cuz my car has been on jackstands for quite awhile now) and
am thinking I might not ever do it again. I now know why they send extra
blades with the feeler gauge. Thirty years of adjusting air cooled
Volkswagens wasn't much help, except for the theory of it. I removed
absolutely everything (catalytic converter, smog pump, heater fan) and still
had difficulty knowing when the gauge was lined up with the gap. I did,
finally, succeed in slipping a tight .004 through all twelve...which left me
a bit nervous. Have you ever done an adjustment where none of the valves
needed changing? I used to have that circumstance with VW's, but there were
only eight valves and I adjusted every 3000 miles.
....trouble is, with everything apart and the wheels off, I'm tempted to just
keep fixin' stuff.

Sorry for so many words PFans, but I have often wished the knowledgeable ones
that answer queries would answer them so that we all could benefit. I have
found this list to be a big plus to the care and feeding of my 911.
