Dennie, after putting 135,000 miles on my '84, I would say if car is in sound
condition I wouldn't worry about a lot of parts.  Would recommend a few cans
of your favorite oil, a selection of fuses (getting harder to find the older
ceramic
style, esp. in non-VW Bug sizes).  Would make sure that rear tires are fresh
and include probably a can or two of flat-repair; I used them once or twice
on 
non-track driven tires with no problems.  Have the A/C checked; the South 
can still get hot & muggy. If the battery is several years old, have it 
checked/replaced  (had one go stone dead in my Audi with no notice).  Oh 
yeah, a bucket &  sponge to wash off the bugs each night.

Enjoy the trip!

Next week I am driving my 1987 911 Coupe from Oak Harbor, WA to
Jacksonville, FL via Jefferson City, MO.  I'm looking for any advice on
spare parts to bring along/lessons learned from past experiences.  My
car has 50K on it and is in great shape.  I have already purchased a
spare DME relay and Cylinder temp relay.  Any insight is appreciated.
