Subject: Electronic ignition conversion/"Ignitor" module

The pointless ignition system you saw in Automotion's catalog is a unit made
by Allison/Crane Engineering. I installed a unit in my '69 T and it works
well.  I replaced my Marelli with a Bosch unit (for quicker ignition advance)
so I purchased a version for the Bosch. I think they also have a version for
the Marelli. Installation was fairly easy but the parts were a tight fit
inside the cap. I would suggest carrying the old contact points, condenser,
etc. in your toolbox for a backup, just in case you're cruising around in the
toolies.

BTW, I bought mine from J.C. Whitney, the ultimate source for Porsche parts.
You might want to look at one of their catalogs. If you get on their mailing
list they'll send you a fresh catalog just as you finish going through their
last one. I have a nifty collection of J.C. Whitney catalogs. Their prices
are better but no cash refunds, just credit (caveat emptor). The unit comes
with a factory limited lifetime warranty and is CARB certified.

The other pointless unit is one called Pertronix. I don't have any info. on
this one. Maybe one of our readers can chime in. The Pertronix costs less
than the Allison/Crane unit ($100 vs. $65). I hope these suggestions aren't
"pointless."
