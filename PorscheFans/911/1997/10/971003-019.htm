> What kind of prices should I expect for a top-end rebuild/valve job on

I did most of the work myself (1983 3.0) and this is what it took:

parts (all genuine Porsche):
~$150 - top end gasket set
~$600 - 6 new exhaust valves
~$150 - 12 new valve guides
~$50  - various fasteners and washers - exhaust studs/nuts, head nuts,
        etc.
~$50  - oil, filter, assembly lube, silicone paste for o-rings, etc.

labor:
1/2 day - remove engine
1 day   - engine disassembly to remove heads and clean things up, repaint
          engine sheet metal
~$700   - machine shop labor to install valve guides, install new exhaust
          valves, regrind all valves, remove 1 broken spark plug and
          install a timesert, remove 1 broken exhaust stud and install
          a timesert
1/2 day - remove cylinders, check ring gaps, clean carbon from pistons,
          install pressure-fed cam chanin tensioners and new chain ramps.
1 day   - engine re-assembly, valve adjustment, engine re-installation


My "days" above are approximately 6-8 hours of my time, doing things
slowly and carefully.  Given the $1700 or so I spent and looking at
all of the labor I put in maybe the price you got was not too far off.
Did the price include new exhaust valves?  Rings?  (my rings were
still within specs.)  I did not break open the bottom end as it is
an SC with "only" 110K miles and I've heard the bottome end should not
need attention that early.  My head studs were fine but your
mechanic may be adding the cost of replacing the head studs knowing
that they often need replacment on the older engines.

The machine shop guy had done many 911 heads in the past, his labor
may have been a bit high but he did an excellent job.  He knew how
to do the guides correctly and how to set the valve heights when
done, not sure if a normal shop would do a great job with this.

I enjoyed doing the work myself and found everthing I needed to know
in either the Haynes manual or Bruce's book.  I have done stuff like
this in the past so had all of the tools and basic knowledge.  The
advantage to doing it yourself is that you can take the extra time
to clean everything up to your satisfaction and get to know how
everything works.

BTW, runs great now and no oil leaks after 10K miles (knock on wood...)

Hope that helps,
