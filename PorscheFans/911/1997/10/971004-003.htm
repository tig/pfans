Joe Crick inquired about removing his Catalytic Converter.
Joe,  The PO removed the converter and air pump on my 78 911 Targa for =
20,000 miles.  Of course, it failed the two-year required emissions test =
in Virginia.  Air quality may not be your primary concern, but without =
the converter, HydroCarbons were 578 with the standard being 400.  With =
the converter and air pump reinstalled, HC fell to 35 and Carbon =
Monoxide to zero.  An astounding difference. =20
My biggest gain for removing the converter is the sweet low rumble of =
the engine.  This, I miss.  Oh sure, I also got a few more horses, but I =
have plenty.  Putting it back is a snap if you install good bolts. =20

Contrary to opinions about reducing weight, I recommend you never remove =
the Exhaust Air Pump if you think it may ever go back.  It simply =
injects air into the exhaust so the converter can burn emissions.  If =
you ever put it back, it can be a real puzzle with two unexpected =
obstacles.  First, getting to the sixth air injector may require =
dropping the left heat exchanger and demands the very difficult task of =
removing rusted hex bolts with no room.  [I was not successful in doing =
this so I had to tap and thread a bolt into the sixth injector supply - =
5 work as well as 6.]  Second, when the injectors were removed and the =
holes pluged with caps, heavy exhaust carbon built up in the remaining =
manifold threads and had to be thoroughly removed before reinstalling =
the air injectors. [A modified tiny wire brush from a Dremel Tool worked =
for this.] =20

Hope this helps. =20
