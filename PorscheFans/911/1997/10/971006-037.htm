Andy, I think I can help with your questions.  I have an
86 911 Coupe which should be identical... Look closely
after removing the black cover.  There should be another
small screw on one side (or both -- working from memory).
Remove these screws and you'll be able to pivot the entire
fader and a/c control assembly down in the console.

To access the wiring and the connectors, you'll need 
to remove the plywood "subfloor" underneath the
carpeting and look under the carpet at the back of the
console.  You may also need to loosen the console
from its mounts on the tunnel.  Look for screws underneath
the carpeting along side the console.  There should be one
on each side of the console and one under the parking
break lever.  Kind of a pain but everything is accessible.

Keep smiling,
