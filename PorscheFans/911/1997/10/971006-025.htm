Christian-- I have been pretty happy with my stock '81 SC Coupe for over 12 
years now. The car runs great overall, I have been pretty lucky so far and 
have not needed any really major repairs, but then I do have low miles on my 
car. Newer cars are faster and have a few convenience improvements, but an SC 
is a nice easy to drive 911( decent engine torque for city driving). My main 
gripe is the perenially lame A/C. When it is working properly (rare) it is not 
very satisfactory ( I live in Florida), and it is quite leaky and usually in 
need of Freon. R12 is now very expensive so I am thinking of changing to new 
R134, but many say that will cool even less efficiently than Freon, so I am at 
a loss as to what to do.I spend several hundred bucks a year on A/C repairs. 
	Generally, however, the car really runs pretty well, and with the exceptions 
of a clutch and alternator, brakes and tires, and some little electrical 
switches and relays, no horrible problems to report (I hope the car did not 
overhear that..). My SC has been a pleasure to own and drive for many years, 
and no, she is not for sale! She is indeed like a member of my family to me.
	So I guess I can endorse a well kept SC as a good car to get.I have a friend 
who has 145,000 miles on his '80 without a motor rebuild yet, and he likes his 
too. But SC's are far from perfect, and they are all fifteen+ years old, so be 
careful and choose wisely... get some more advice.The pre '80 models have smog 
pumps, which are not the greatest thing to have. Other people do report 
trouble with timing chain tensioners and clutches going bad (mine just wore 
out).    
	re: color-- The old German Auto Union race cars of the thirtees were often 
silver in color, and I have seen silver racing Mercedes from the fiftees.   
Good luck, RWC.
