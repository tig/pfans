Pfans,

I have an 84 Carrera with about 90k miles on it. I have had it for about =
a month.

1)  The car runs a little rough when it is cold. When I start it the =
idle cycles between about1100 and 900 for 2 cycles, then steadies out =
around 1000 (once the car warms up I think the idle is around 800). For =
about the first 5 minutes of a drive it runs a little rough ( I keep the =
revs below 4k). I am curious is this is normal. Every other car (non =
P-car) I have owned with fuel injection runs very smoothly cold, warm, =
low rpms, high rpms.=20

2)  There is another condition where the car runs a bit rough... when I =
am on one of the small local streets and are trying to keep within 30-40 =
mph speed limits, the car seems to run a little rough between 2800 and =
3000 rpm (this is with a warmed up engine). You don't notice any =
roughness or hesitation when accelerating through the range, just when =
you are trying to keep a consistent slow speed. This is much more subtle =
than the cold roughness.


I have noticed recent posts mentioning warm up regulators, and cleaning =
injectors. Are one of these my problem ? Do I have a problem or is this =
normal? Is this something I can repair myself (limited auto/mechanical =
skills) ?=20

TIA,

Vann Knight
84 Targa
