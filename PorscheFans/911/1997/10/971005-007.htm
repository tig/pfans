Thanks to all who responded to my post a few months ago about front suspension
pan replacement on a 911. Got my car back yesterday and it looks/drives GREAT!
Many places I took the car acted like I was asking for the impossible. With
most "body" shops (yeah right..) I might as well have been asking for them to
find the Holy Grail! Well, thanks to some good friends (Thanks Garner Porsche
Team!) I was able to get the job done for $684 labor. I had originally
received quotes from $2-3,000. When a REAL body shop was located the car was
finished within 24 hours and now it's back home. The shop had done this type
repair
to 911's before.
Looking back it seems that all the high quotes and "Holy-Grail" responses came
from shops that had never done anything remotely similar before.
Moral of the story: Sometimes (emphasis: SOMETIMES) the shop that can do the
best job will also be the shop that can do the job for less...
