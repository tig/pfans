probably the turbo waste gate, letting go of the over pressure.

This sound also intrigued my friend and I at Sebring. This sound comes
only under braking and not specifically under deceleration. On all the
GT1's I could get close enough to the brake rotors have three slots
about a quarter inch wide and quite deep (well over an eighth) about a
quarter inch apart. The first is about an inch long the second three
quarters and the last about a half inch. They run directly across the
diamiter (not like gas slots). I think they act as gas slots and are
responsible for the whistles, maybe even a warning about excessive 
rotor wear. But this is just a guess!
