I just test drove an '86 911 Targa and I have a few questions that if =
anyone could provide some opinions on I would appreciate it.

The car has 86,000 miles and appears to be in excellent condition. No =
dings, or dents. Appears to be original paint. Band new P700 tires. The =
interior had no cracks, or wear marks. The inside liner on the Targa top =
was loose and tore a little bit on the out side edges. The engine =
compartment was clean.

When I started the engine, it started instantly. (The engine was cold.) =
During warm up it ran very smooth at ~900 RPM. Once the engine warmed up =
the RPMs dropped to about 800 and there was a slight burble to the =
exhaust note. Oil pressure was 4-5 bar.

During the test drive, the car felt very solid. The test drive was on a =
two lane country road. The only thing that I did not expect was that =
over slightly uneven pavement on straight or slightly curving road, the =
steering wheel seemed to jiggle back and forth slightly. More than I =
would expect for normal road feed back. In a hard turn or on smooth =
pavement it felt solid. There were three people in the car at the time =
(my wife, the sales guy and myself). Could the extra weight of the guy =
in the back seat cause the twitchiness of the steering wheel or could it =
be a worn steering component, or is this normal for the car.

The dealer is asking $ 25,900 for the car. Kelly Blue book retail is =
29,250 and wholesale is $19,950. What is a fair price for the car?

I am looking for any comments on the car. Is '86 a good year? Is a year =
earlier or later have any significant advantages as in model features?

The car is bright red. Has anyone found a correlation between the color =
of the car and the frequency of being pulled over by the highway patrol? =
Is a silver or white car less apt to be pulled over? This assumes the =
driver is not driving like an idiot.

Thanks for any comments,
Dieter Schulze
