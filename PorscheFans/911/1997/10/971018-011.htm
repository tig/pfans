Hi All, 

I am new to this list and also new to being a Porsche owner.  I recently
bought a 1975 911s and have fallen in love with the car.  I have done a
little searching but have not been able to find the exact number of
silver anniversary Porshes built that year.  I have found it difficult
to find detailed information about the 1975 silver edition Porsche  in
books or on users web pages.   
The actually sticker in the window of the car says 1949 - 1974 Driving
in its purest form. 
The car was built in sept.  1974, but the model year and owners manual
that I recieved say it is a 1975.  Is the car considered a 1974 or 1975
as far as statistics are concerned and anybody know the number built by
chance?  

Thanks,   

Derick  
75 911s
