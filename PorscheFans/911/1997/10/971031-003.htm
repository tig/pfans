Hi - I have a 1970 911 coupe with a 2.7 engine, Webers, headers,
and 915 transmission.  The engine was built to one of the formulas
in Bruce Anderson's book (Euro RS pistons, E cams) and is rated 
at 210 HP.  The oil cooler setup includes the stock cooler on
the engine, plus a thermostat, oil lines and trombone front cooler
from a later car.  The oil lines from the thermostat to the trombone
are the original type metal lines.  The lines from the engine to
the thermostat don't look OEM.
   The oil temp runs about 180 on the street and I did see 250
when I had the car at the track on a hot (90 degree) day.  The car
is basically a track car and driven very little on the street.
My questions are:
1.  Do I need to improve the oil cooling because of the high
oil temperature when I ran the car at the track?  Would just
using synthetic oil be good enough?
2.  The current oil lines look like kind of a Rube Goldberg
setup to me.  Could I simplify things by just running a large
diameter line directly from the engine to a front oil cooler,
and then back to the oil tank?
3.  Is the thermostat absolutely necessary or can it be
eliminated?
 
Thanks for any advice you can offer!
 
Larry Correnti
