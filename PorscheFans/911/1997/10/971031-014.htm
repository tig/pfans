My friend has a 90 C2 and would like to lower the car. He wanted me to post
this question to all that have experienced this process.  I have told him of
the wealth of information I have gotten on my ill 72T.   He would like to know
of the proper way to lower the C2 and what parts are needed.  Also he read
that Porsche sells a lowering kit, has any one had experience with this kit?
One other question about the C2,  What are some opinions of the B & B exhaust
systems?  And one final question, (for my car) does anyone know of any
books/publications about the Bosche Mech. Injection.  I've looked all over and
cant seem to find any info. about it any where. Is this a well kept Porsche
secret that that Dr. Ferdinand has taken to the grave???
thanks in advance.

86 volvo wagon
