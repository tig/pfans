Troy,

Some passenger cars have specs that give more negative camber to one side
of the car than the other. I am told this is to help the car track straight
on crowned roads. Porsche specs call for the same camber left and right,
which is appropriate for the highest performance cornering on the road, but
it does mean the car may want to drive off of a crowned road. To see if
this is the case with your car, try driving on the WRONG side of the road,
and see if it now pulls to the left.

Of course, other suspension settings may be affecting this too. I'm not a
suspension set-up expert.
