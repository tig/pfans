> Starter Problems
> 
> I remember when I first bought my 74 911, it would fail to start on
> occasion. For example I could be on a long trip and stop for gas or
> something, only to find the starter was dead when I was ready to go
> again. Everything else worked fine, horn lights, etc. It was
> embarrassing to have to ask for a push, especially since the car
> usually attracted attention. The problem would then disappear for a
> while, then when you least expected it, WHAM, it would die again. I
> tried replacing relays and fuses etc, I even considered buying a new
> starter.
> 
> After a year or so of this foolishness, I finally simply removed and
> cleaned the flat braided ground strap that goes from the transmission
> to the body and my problem has not reoccurred since, and it has been
> well over 5 years now.
> 
> This would be worth a try and best of all... ITS FREE!!
