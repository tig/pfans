If it really is fully restored, it's an OK price.  But different people have
different ideas about what fully restored is.  Here's a point on the
curve.

I just sold my 1972 911E Targa for $10,500.  I set the price based on
Bruce Anderson's price guide to used 911's, the one that appeared
recently in Excellence, and on local ads.   This price is a bit below
Anderson's figure for that car in 'excellent' condition, and a bit higher
than most, but not all, local ads.  (I wasn't interested in making money,
but simply in recouping my dollar --not time--costs.)

Mine was fully restored.  Complete engine overhaul including valves,
rings, bearings, timing chains, rails, and so on.  Stripped to bare metal
paint job.  No rust. Not even around the battery boxes.  I know.  I've been
into every part of it.   Almost all new rubber seals, including the targa
seals, new Bilstein shocks, completely rebuilt brake system, new
carpets, clutch, tires, hoses, ignition stuff, targa skin and headliner, etc.
You name it, it was done.  Everything worked, and everything was
original, except the color. (See below.)

The buyer got what was basically a brand new car.  That's the
difference between a full restoration and say just an engine overhaul,
or paint job, or even both.  Every part had been removed, cleaned,
inspected, rebuilt or replaced.

It did have a few 'faults'.  Some would consider the color change a fault.
I don't. I just couldn't live with the original light blue.  I repainted it
a very
slightly off-white.  It had an occasional drip of oil from the lower
valve covers,  but it is a Porsche, after all...  I suppose the other 'fault'
is that I did the restoration myself,  and there are assuredly aspects of it
that would be better had they been done by a professional who does it
for a living, day in and day out, rather than by someone like me who
has far less experience.

Check.  It may not have them.  Mine didn't. There were plenty of E's
sold without the hydropneumatic struts.  I wouldn't be surprised if
more were sold without them than with them.

Good luck!
