Robert,
I don't know where you live, but I take my car to Gary Auberlen, at Paul's
Speedometer in Redondo Beach, 529 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach,
90277
His phone number is (310) 374-3017, I am sure you can UPS it to him if you are
not local.
Typical charge to repair a speedo is about $85.  You can easily remove the
speedo with a screwdriver wrapped with masking tape.

<<The car has a Autothority chip which I want to replace with the original

due to my concerns about additional wear.>>

I have no idea who started everyone worrying about extra wear being put on a
car by changing the computer chip, but it's ridiculous.  In no way does a
computer chip put any more strain on your engine.  All they do is re-map the
timing, fuel injector flow and rpm limiter.  If you buy a quality chip from
the likes of AutoThority they come with a money back satisfaction guaranteed
warranty fo at least one year.  Plus, they've been extensively tested before
being sold to the public.  I have both AutoThority chips in my 87 928S4 and
couldn't be happier.  Don't succumb to old wive's tales.  Buy a chip, drive
fast (but safely), enjoy life.
=)

P.S.  I just picked up a diamond blue/maroon leather 1987 928S4 auto that is
in beautiful shape.  Had it checked out by my mechanic alrerady.  The car is
here in Evansville IN and ready for sale.  Get in touch with me.

I'd say that a great price on that car, if it's a coupe or targa, would be
around $20K.
