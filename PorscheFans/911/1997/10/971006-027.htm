Ok, as a result of the never ending quest to get more and more out of
Our cars. I have some great used parts that were replaced due to upgrades.....
(some of these may make some minds start to work as to what the hell did he replace it with....)

1 Distributor w/cap & rotor (Used, working fine rotor and cap are  less than a year old)
1 (set) Of tie-rods (Used,  nothing wrong with them. Boots in good shape too)
1 K&N Air Filter (New in box, direct replace of Factory filter)
1 (set) original on car Fuch wheels 7&8 x 15 ( I will recheck they are 7&8 's if anyone is interested. I pretty sure 
but..I reserve the right to be wrong since I really never had the wheels on the car a long time.
They are 15's and I'm fairly sure they are 7&8..but....) Even comes with a set of Potenza's
That have only about 7k of use so tires are still great for street (I'll throw tires in for free
if you want them other wise I'll have them pulled off the rims. Rims are in very good shape.
Have all of the centers caps (they are even hand painted crest).

1 (entire) exhaust system...Muffler, cat all pipes...(99% of straps and assorted hardware)
	In fact you won't even have to assemble it. It is all connected and ready to bolt in. All Original Factory Porsche
	Stuff. Worked fine when I took it off 4 years ago.

Most of this is due to SSI's, Twin-plugging, Turbo-Tie-rods, new Koni Sports(old shocks not worth keeping, 
even to give away) And 17' wheels. However, since all of this talk about the "knock-off" wheels cracking 
under track conditions. I am In the process of going to a real 17' track safe wheel..(the real also stands for "real 
expensive")..thus the sale. Also need the space. Make me an honest offer and pay shipping and it yours.

ALL OF THE ABOVE IS OFF OF AN 1988 911 TARGA 3.2 U.S car made in October of 1987
(if any of that makes a diff to you.) Not too bad for an Octoberfest car.....!!!!!
