Eli: Its more like a booklet. And, of course over-priced.

It does have lots of nuggets of useful info. Does a very good job of
pointing out a number of things to watch for in the 911s of past years.

I have mixed feeling about the book. My prefererence, nonetheless, is to
have more info on the 911 rather than less.

Consider purchasing. Prerfromance products of California has it. 
Also EWA. Bothe of these are listed in "Porsche Platz Accessories" 
on the INTERNET.

Subject: Book:  The Used 911 Story

I just read the post mentioning the book "The Used 911 Story."  A few
questions:

1)  How useful a book is this?  I'm hoping to buy an old targa in a year
    or so, but I'm starting my research now.  I already have Anderson's 
    "911 Performance Handbook" and the Haynes guide but I'm always
looking
    for new resources.  Do I need this book?

2)  This book is out of print.  Anyone know where I can get a copy?

3)  If no, does anyone have an old copy they wouldn't mind selling?

Please send replies to eli.leland@trilogy.com

Thanks,
Eli Leland
