Greetings - 

As I understand, points on a P_car with CDS carry very little voltage,
don't wear out very quickly and essentially only act as a switch for the
CDS, therefore dwell is not an issue, etc.  Therefore, I don't see that
the expense of the "ignitors" optical triggers is worth the $$. 
Certainly, an early model 911 w/o CDS could benefit.  Any other thoughts
or opinions?

I have a Marelli SX112 distributor with rotor and tall cap for sale for
any of those purists interested.  Was working when removed.

Yes, this is the Pertronix "Ignitor". I just put one in my '70 911T
on the advise of my local P-shop. So far so good. I'm pretty
impressed with the product. An elegant solution to the problem of
points. It was a little more difficult to install than "changing a
set of points" but not much. Just make sure that you have a
compatible distributor. BTW, the Tweeks price is very good.
