Does anyone have any advice/ideas about my problem?

Car:
82 911SC, 89K miles, owned for 6 months, 7K trouble-free miles,
daily driver.

Symptoms:
First noticed yesterday morning. Temperature 75, steady drizzle.
Car started normally, ran normally...until I would hit a bump
in the road at which time I would lose engine power for about as long as
it would take my shocks to rebound. As if ignition was cutting out
temporarily. Radio and lights seemed unaffected. I drove about 50 miles
on fairly smooth highway (70 to 120 mph) and the engine ran strong
except for the 3 or 4 power loss incidents.
The car sat idle for 2 hours. Then started normally. Drove about 10
miles. Car sat idle for 45 minutes. Car started normally again. Drove
another 50 miles home. Confirmed the power losses at road bumpettes or
potholes. Once back home with car at idle I checked engine area
superficially for loose wires or anything else unusual at the front of
the engine. No strange noises.
Car sat for about an hour. Then had trouble starting. Engine would kick on
but idle was irregularly low and car tended to die without accelerator
pressure. At this point I decided my road testing was over and got the
car back into my garage. My Pcar Mech has no time free until Monday.
This morning, the engine would kick on readily but immediately die.

I'd love to troubleshoot this problem and fix it myself (hopefully with
some good advice from the list; my honda experience doesn't seem to do
me much good so far with this Porsche). I've got a big garage, a Haynes
manual, a Saturday free, but no clear concept of where to start. I
suspect electrical problems, do you agree? What/how should I check? At
least I'd like to get the car running well enough to drive it the 20
miles to the Pcar shop. It pains me to see a 911 moving not under its
own power.

Your assistance is appreciated. Would you mind copying me directly on
any reply? Thank you.
