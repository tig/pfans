I received several "me too" replies to my post describing my inability to
post to this mailing list from my account at work.  Thinking that there may
be many more of you out there, I figured I'd post how my solution to this
problem.  It probably won't work for everyone, but it's worth a try.

The key to this my posting problem lay in the fact that the porschefans
list will only accept a post from an account whose email address is
*identical* to the address provided when that account subscribed.  For
examlple, I originally subscribed as eli.leland@trilogy.com, but our email
system at work automatically identifies my outgoing messages as coming from
Eli_Leland@trilogy.com.  Had I been more observant, I might have noticed
that it was the latter address which was identified in the replies I
received telling me my posts had bounced.  E.g.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Eli_Leland@trilogy.com is not allowed...(etc.)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:  I unsubscribed eli.leland@trilogy.com, resubscribed as
Eli_Leland@trilogy.com, and now I can post.

Thanks to Eduardo Ho for the enlightenment.
