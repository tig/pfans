Hi Gregg

Tyres are like fruit it seems - some years some are more in vogue than
others.  It also depends on who won what race wearing which rubber, etc,
etc.  And on the marketing skills of the person running the ad
campaigns, etc, etc ,etc.

I have a '79 911 SC and I have Pirelli P5000s all round.

I reckon that car manufacturers strike a deal with suppliers - give some
input into a "special run" - produce a number of batches of product -
then use that product, and tyres would be treated in the same way.

I got the Pirellis because when I was looking for a new set I read a
magazine article that compared about 12 different name brands which said
Pirellis are the best in the wet.  That was the deciding factor for me. 
(Michelin came out on top in that article but I had Michelin ZX's on a
car when I was 17 and they slipped all over the place!!)

I can put my 911 around a corner/bend in the road/whatever and I don't
even squeal the tyres even though I am travelling at a speed probably
faster than nearly anyone would go around the same bend.  It's that
squeal that I listen for - similar to a stall warning in a light
aircraft which comes on at about 15 miles per hour above stall speed. 
No squeal - no risk of losing it, I think.

I trust the Pirellis.  I rely on them to keep me on the road and on
course which are the 2 most desirable items at the time of high-speed
cornering.

So I use them.  

I don't sell them - I work with computer software.
