My '79 911SC has a heater control mounted between the front seats and
the dial has broken away from the insides of the device even though the
whole unit is still in one piece.  So, you can turn the dial round and
it doesn't do anything.  I have disconnected the lever with the
orange/red end on it from the short black stub/arm.  The short black
stub/arm is at the top of the opening and the lever with the red end of
it is at the bottom of the opening.

The problem is that I get hot air coming into the cabin from behind my
head.  It's a right-hand drive being in Australia.  I've had the local
Porsche dealer try and find where the heat is coming from but the can't
find anything.  We've had the car up on a lift and looked at the 2 vents
and they're in the right position they say.

Does anyone have any ideas?
