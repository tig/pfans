I had the unique and wonderful experience of attending my first Club Race at 
Heartland Park this past weekend.  Racing is something I had always wanted to 
try but never had.  I watched the club race at my home track, Texas World 
Speedway and knew I didn't want to be too old to race some day and wish I had 
done this in my life so I set up my daily driver 911 and entered a race.  
There are so many emotions involved in a first race weekend that it makes me 
weary just to think about it this soon.  Since things are still fresh in my 
mind and I want to try to share some of the experience with others... well 
here goes.

The first day was a Driver Education day on Friday.  This was not an emotional 
experience since I had been instructing for about 3 years at TWS and Hallett.  
I tried to learn the track where I had never been as quickly as possible so I 
could concentrate on racing the next 2 days.  The cars for the DE day were 
divided into 4 run groups, a DE only group and the 3 race groups.  We would 
stay in our race groups all weekend.  Race groups are a grouping of several 
race classes of cars with similar performance potential.  My class, class F ( 
I have a stock 84 3.2 Carrera) was set up in group 2.  Class F was the slowest 
class of the lettered cars in the group which also included GT 4&5 S  and some 
GT-X cars.  The X cars are 2 driver cars being driven out of class.  The day 
was normal DE except that cars were much closer than "normal" DE on the track 
at least in my group.  

Friday evening I attended a mandatory meeting for rookie candidate drivers.  
The meeting covered track etiquette, safety, passing and several stern 
warnings about over aggression.

Saturday morning brought nerves, BIG time.  Today I would drive for the first 
time with up to 42 cars on the track and, as the Race Steward put it, every 
square inch of the track would be up for contention.  Lots of experienced 
folks came by wishing me well and telling me I would be fine.  The race 
community is extremely friendly and helpful. Any time I asked for help or 
advice all weekend it was graciously given.   As I strapped in on the grid for 
my first practice session I had to concentrate very hard to control my 
breathing.  I knew my track experience should prepare me for what I was about 
to do but it was still the great unknown.  

Finally we were waved onto the track.  As I cleared the pit wall and put the 
pedal down the Porsche seemed to jump ahead.  I swear it seemed to be saying 
to me " Don't worry. I know what to do.  I was born for this ".  The first lap 
was under yellow.  Every on was warming their tires and brakes.  Then the 
green was out and away we went.  

The first time I was passed was at the apex of turn 5 on the first green lap.  
I knew the other car was there and saw him duck inside for an early apex so I 
slowed a little more took a wider line and gave him room then pulled in right 
behind him at the track out.  Hey that wasn't so bad.  

OOPS!  Trouble ahead.  I was catching another car.  What to do?  I followed a 
little and realized.  I didn't have the horsepower to pass on the straight.  
So I backed off just a little then moved up on him at my pace during a series 
of turns, took a very late apex coming onto the straight a made an easy pass 
coming out of the last turn.  Hey, something sunk in during all those DE 
sessions.  

I made a bunch more passes and was passed a zillion time during the three 
practice sessions and it became familiar. I learned that I needed a new type 
of pass in my bag of tricks,  the brake pass.

Next came practice starts.  In this exercise we would form up in to 2 abreast 
rows just like the NASCAR boys and practice rolling starts.  After the third 
start we would continue for a 5 lap race.  This scared the hell out of me.  I 
could imagine 40 cars thundering down the front straight then a fighting for 
the narrow line into turn 1 which is a second gear turn.  This image was both 
true and not true.  I was surprised that our speed was not high as we 
approached the starter.  About mid way up in second I think.  The green came 
out on my first start and there was definitely thunder.  More than 40 of 
Porsche's finest 6's in race trim all at full throttle do make a noise.  The 
steward had cautioned us at the rookie school to watch the tack because we 
would not be able to hear our engines.  I remembered this just after my car 
started learching against the rev-limiter.    Coming up on turn 1.  What's 
this?  Everyone is slowing early.  I can see that heads are turning and eyes 
are darting every which way.  Not one car is out of control.  Everyone is 
actually being careful.  No fighting.  This is gentlemen's racing.   No 
problem.  Our speed was relatively low and stayed that way as long as we were  
2 abreast.  

By the third practice start I was comfortable and we went racing.  I made it 
past  a couple of cars and got passed a couple of times by those darn brake 
passes.   The last 3 laps I spent right on a guys bumper that I could catch 
fairly easily but could not get around.  Gotta try a brake pass my self and I 
know just where.  What's this ?  Darn the checkered flag is out.  Well, I 
learned a lot today.

The next day was race day.  One warm up session, qualifying and a 12 lap race. 
 I spent much of the warm up session driving off the normal line because I 
knew by now that the "race line"  is where ever the race takes you.

Qualifying was a lot like a DE day.  Everyone was looking for clear track and 
not much racing was going on.  I qualified with a time that was OK for me and 
my daily driver at 2:09.  This put me 28th on the grid and 11 of 17 in class.

Now it's time to race.  Another drivers meeting where every one was warned 
again to use there head and have FU N.  I watched the start of the group 3 
race then took my time getting into my gear.  On the grid everyone was all 
business.  I noticed grid folks checking everyone's car to make sure we were 
all buttoned up.  I was having to control my breathing again.  Finally the 
pace car pulled out and away we went.  As we cleared the pit wall my nerves 
vanished.  I was actually prepared to do this.  The Porsche Clubs Driver 
Education  and Club Race programs work.  I had a ball.  I started off running 
with another 911 for a couple of laps then I got hung up with a couple of D 
class 993's that had to start at the back because they didn't make weight and 
my 911 guy got a lead then a 944 turbo came up behind and we raced very 
closely for the remainder of the race.  He passed me coming into turn 12 with 
a darned brake pass.  He got a  little squirely from carrying too much speed 
into the corner so I backed out.  I could really push him in the corners and 
he pulled me on the straight just a tad.  I tried a brake pass on him in 15 
but wasn't sure he saw me so I backed out.  He apparently did see me because 
he left me room inside.  This pushed him off line for 16 and he got a little 
sideways.  I saw the opening inside and floored it but because I slowed when 
he got sideways I need 1st gear but was in second.  He pulled me down the 
straight and kept the lead in our little battle.  I new we were getting close 
to the end.  The next lap coming out of 16 I was again within 5 feet of his 
bumper but I could see the checkered flag and knew it was over.  It was a 
blast.   The 944 driver and I congratulated each other as we were held in the 
hot pits.  I looked around and this scene was being reproduced all around.  
Each of the little battles in the race was important and fun.  This is Club 
Racing.  Into the paddock where lots of rehashing of a wonderful afternoon 
took place.  At the awards gathering lots of thanks for all the folks that 
work so hard so we can have fun.  What's this?  They are calling my name.  I 
received the rookie award for the weekend.  All the drivers got a nice mug 
commemorating the event and the winners a bottle of champagne.

I had finished 24th in group and 11th in class.  I could not have felt better 
if I had won.  You know,  I think I did.
