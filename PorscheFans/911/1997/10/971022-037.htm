I am planning to paint a set of cookie cutters.  I was wondering if someone
had any suggestions on the type of paint to use.  I want the centers to be
black and am not sure if this should be a gloss or semi-gloss paint.  Also,
the chrome rim section on a few of the wheels is in such bad shape, I am
considering painting the rims with some sort of metallic paint.  I want the
wheels to look nice but since they're mostly used for the track, I don't want
to spend the money to have them professionally redone.  Any suggestions on
paint materials / techniques would be appreciated.  I have spray equip if
that route would be superior to the old spray can.  TIA for any help.
