Hi,

The mysterious possession of my ventilation fan happened again yesterday,
twice ('90 C2).

After some spirited driving, the fan took on a mind of it's own. First it
started cycling between fan speeds '1' and '2', then '1' and '3', then '1'
and '4', then all over the place.

This is more disconcerting than you might imagine while trying to concentrate
at high velocity!

Turning the car off produces a rapid thunking or clicking noise (perhaps 4
clicks per second) but they sound not exactly like a normal relay. Noise
seems to be coming from the dash. Removing and replacing the fuse (fuse #1)
seems to reset everything.

Question - is there a mechanical relay that controls the fan? I.e. something
I might be able to take apart and look for corrosion, etc? If so, where is it
and how might I reach it?

The fact that this only seems to happen after very spirited driving makes
me believe there's something mechanical involved... OTOH, the problem 'fixes'
itself with a re&re of the fuse, sounding purely electrical in nature...

Thanks!
