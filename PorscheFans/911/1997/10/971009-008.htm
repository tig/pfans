Has anyone tried the Carbrella top for Targas that Performance 
Products.............. 

Andy,
 I've got a top just like a Carbrella top, It looks the same etc.,just 
doesn't have the name printed on the side ( which personally I 
wouldn't want).  Damn, I don't remember the name of the company, just 
that I saw it advertised in Excellence magazine and bought it about 
6-8 yrs ago.
Yes it will fold up, small enought to lay in the back seat luggage 
area. It attaches with suction cups to your side windows (sounds kind 
of chinzy) thats the reason it over hangs the side windows (you can't 
see the s-cups from the outside). But it works. Never had it blow off 
in a big wind storm. It will give some rain protection ( but thats not 
what its made for). And no you can't drive with it on (at least not at 
any great speed or distance, I guess? I've never done it). But its 
great for tooling around, it installs faster than your targa top. And 
99.9% of people don't know its not the real top. I've put it on and 
have gone to malls, baseball games etc. with no problem. Last thing, 
you are right to not fold up your targa top. After R&R the top for a 
third time, the last time I have never folded it up, thats been 6-8 
yr, and it looks new inside and out.
