Bob Williams wonders why one would want to replace the points on a
CD equipped car with a non-point system.  He is right that the low
current through the points means little arcing and long life for the point
surfaces.  However, the rubbing block wears just like it does on any
other points system, so you have to adjust things from time to time.   As I
recall from my 2.7, which was such a car, there is also a dwell angle
(which is a function of the point gap) specified, so if you don't trust your
gapping skills, you can measure the dwell.  Whether or not this justifies
the expense of upgrading to an aftermarket pointless system I don't
know, but I sure wouldn't think of replacing the the pointless system the
factory put in my 81, believing it was a better mousetrap.  It never does
change, so the only time you have to fool with the timing is when you
remove and replace the distributor.

I bought the Allison system through JCWhitney also maybe 8 years ago,
but I think the part that has to be pressed over the cam broke when I tried
to do this, so the whole deal was a fiasco and sits uselessly waiting for
me to throw it out - our street cars don't need it, and the race engines
have an even better mousetrap - crankfire.   I am glad to hear others
have had better luck, as it looked well made.
