        Hi all I have a 68 911T and have just been offered some parts
     from a 70/71 911T !! I was just wondering about the front suspension??
     If I removed the A arms and struts would that work on my body?? 
     I know that some of the 68 stuff is very difficult to find ! 
     Is this possible to do the switch?? I thought that the bodies 
     were wider but I just want to make sure !! Don't want to not pick 
     up the stuff and later regret it!! Also it has a 2.2 will that 
     tranny fit in my car?? Any help would be much appreciated
     
     Thanks 
     Argeo P
