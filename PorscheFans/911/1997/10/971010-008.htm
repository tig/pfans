Re-post due to list not sent Oct 7,8
Hello,

A little while ago there was a thread about harness hookup
in cars. Generally it seemed that the shoulder harness and
lap belts were no problem but the sub strap was more
difficult. I felt nobody came up with a really good way to
fasten the sub straps without drilling a hole in the car
floor. I've been thinking about this and have come up with
an idea that I would like some feedback on. Here it goes
.......

1/ remove the seat rails

2/ replace the rails with 1/4 " spacers under them. Use
appropriately  longer grade 8.8 bolts.

3/ use a sub strap with two try down points

4/ pass a try down point through the 1/4" space under the
seat rails

5/ connect the harness to the same points as the lap belts

To my way of thinking this should even meet SCCA rules and
yet require no holes to be drilled. The only downside is
that you loose a 1/4" of head room. What's the consensus ?
