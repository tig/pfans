Brian:

I just fixed this in my C2(with street BFGs) by dropping the front
(hot)tire pressures about 5 lbs ad the suggestion of a tire engineer. It
was unbelievable how much better the brakes dug in and turn in was also
way better. The car was much more stable in sweepers without loosing
responsiveness. I found that by doing the "chalk test" on the outside
tread blocks you can get a pretty close optimization of inflation
pressures. Expreiment and see for yourself.
