     Brian,
     
     Here are a couple of responses to your questions on the list:
     
     1)  With respect to injection in SC's.  According to the 911FAQ by 
     Wade Guthrie, SC's, even later ones, have k-jetronic (CIS) which is a 
     mechanical fuel injection system. 84+ Carreras have motronic systems.
     
     2)  Most of the window trimming on my car has faded from black to a 
     silvery/pewter tone.  Apparently the factory finish on the these parts 
     was some type of anodizing that eventually fades off.  The PO of my 
     car painted the rear lid badge with a special matte black paint called 
     "trim paint" that one gets at an automotive paints store.  The result 
     is pretty good, but to do the window frames is going to require a lot 
     of prepping/masking.  I have not done this yet.
     
     I hope this helps.
