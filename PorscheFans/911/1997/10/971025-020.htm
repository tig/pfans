William--

I've attached a list I developed a few years ago for a previous Porsche
group.  This is the portion that covers the 9xx model numbers.  This is cars
only; I didn't try to list gearboxes, etc., even though they have some
similar numbers.  The list came from several Porsche-oriented publications.
I hope it's of use.

-----------------

     901  - Prototype 6-cylinder sports car, basis for 911, 1963; 
            changed to 911 for production because of conflict with 
            Peugeot numbering scheme.  6 prototypes built.
     904  - Mid-engine competition GT coupe, with various engines in 
            1963-1964, 100+ built, some for street use. 
     906  - Competition sports coupe (space frame), 1966-1967.
     907  - Sports/racing coupe, various iterations, 1967-1968.
     908  - 3-liter, 8-cylinder competition car, various bodies,
            1968-1970.
     909  - 2-liter hill climb spyder, 1968.
     910  - Sports racing coupe, different configurations, 1966-1968.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the 993.  
            Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Many engine variations have existed through its long life, 
            from the original 2-liter car to the 3.8-liter RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1966 through
            1969; 912E in '76 was a revival with engine from the 914.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6
            was a Porsche-built variant with a two-liter 911 engine
            inserted in place of the four-cylinder engine and other
            refinements.
     916  - Projected 2.4-liter version of 914/6, 1971.  Was apparently
            used in competition by the factory.  Also, a few examples 
            of an 8-cylinder (908-based) version supposedly exist.
     917  - 12-cylinder competition car, famous for Le Mans and CanAm
            victories; various iterations, 1969-1973.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine; updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain;
            has the best aerodynamic shape of any street Porsche.
     928  - The high-end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5-liter
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, sold in 1980-1982.
     934  - Group 4 racing 930 turbo coupe, 1975-1976.
     935  - Group 5 racing 930 turbo coupe, 1976.
     936  - Group 6 turbocharged spyder, 1976.
     937  - 924 Carrera GT.
     939  - 924 Carrera GT Le Mans.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four-cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5-liter displacement, except for a 2.7-liter
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3-liter 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     956  - GT racing car, loosely based on 911; 1982-1983.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative; 2.85-liter, four-valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive; not street-legal in US.
     962  - GT racing car based loosely on 911; used in endurance racing 
            and IMSA GTP; 1984.
     964  - The 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4, introduced in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992 with revised styling.  A 
            noteworthy feature is variable valve timing.
     986  - The Boxster, introduced  in Sept. '96, the newest hope for 
            Porsche's future.
