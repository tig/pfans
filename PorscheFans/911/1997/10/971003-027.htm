Well, today received my first speeding ticket in many years in NY (doing
75 in a 65) while in my 911. I just moved here a few months ago so I
don't really know NY law and what my options are (ie: is it worth
fighting or should I just pay it). I didn't say a single word until
after I received the ticket, at which time I asked to see the radar
reading and caliberation sticker and was refused(this used to work for
getting out of them in GA if they refused). Is there anyone out there
with experience in such matters? Since this probably isn't the
appropriate forum, a private email would be appreciated.

Thanks
