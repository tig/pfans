<<I went to see the Laguna Seca Race on Sunday. And I saw a Porsche sign next
to the main grandstand. I asked the person who was guarding the gate if I
can go in. And he nicely told me that it was PCNA invitational only. I
wondering who get invited.

And what is PCNA? what do they do?
And what is PCA?

Hi Clemson,

PCNA is Porsche Cars North America, Inc., the Porsche AG owned US importer
for Porsches. There area that you saw was where PCNA was entertaining their
dealers at the races. 

PCA is the Porsche Club of America, a club the supports the ownership and
enjoyment of the cars that they buy from PCNA and their dealers.
