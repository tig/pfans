  I never thought it was easy and considered modifying the pedal in some way.
Then I saw a female instructor with tiny little feet wearing those skinny
little 
white Keds sneakers heel-toe in my 911 with no problem. I guess it's
technique.
  From a human factors standpoint, I would think the higher up [further from 
the hinge] on the gas pedal you could press, the more "feel" you would have. 

Moving the gas pedal 3/4" with the side/ball of your foot is lot easier than 
moving the pedal 1/4" with the heel of your foot.
  I must admit, those Sparco pedal sure look neat and I've seen some
of the club racer folks using them.
