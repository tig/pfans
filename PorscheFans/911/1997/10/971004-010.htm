Greetings,

I am in need of advice. . .  Here is my situation.  My '82 SC is my =
daily driver.  Friday coming home from work I am thinking that the car =
had never run better, so I took the really long way home over some back =
roads for a little fun.  Later in the evening, we took it to dinner.

This morning when running errands, everything stated out fine.  However, =
about a mile from home, I noticed a sudden drop in power.  I pulled over =
to the sid to find the idle had dropped from a solid 1K to 750 and =
rough.  I then tried to accelerate, and experienced low power and =
multiple backfires (I do have a pop off valve).  As I continued on, it =
got marginally better, especially as I would get over 50 MPH.  As long =
as the engine was running at this point, it ran ok, but clearly lacking =
bottom end power.  When I parked the car for a couple of hours, it =
restarted fine, but the idle was at 750 and had to idle for several =
minutes to develop enough power to pull away.  Again, multiple =
backfires.  I put fresh gas in it and drove home on the interstate and =
it ran still better until I went a couple of miles of stop and go =
traffic where the idle returned to a very rough 750 RPM. =20

Recently, my P-wrench as cleaned the injectors, put a new warm up =
regulator in and adjusted the mixture.  Any and all ideas on the source =
for this sudden problem are much appreciated.

Hal Michael
