Hi Joe,

I've got a Momo wheel also and like it very much! I got the 'Competition'
wheel, which I prefere  because it is 'thicker' than most other Momo
s.wheels also it doesn't have these extreme 'notches' which dictate you
where to put your hands. It's black perforated leather. Like most Momo
wheels it's 350 mm in diameter. I would not suggest going smaller than
350mm. The 320 mm s.wheels you see a lot, make steering your 911 terribly
heavy (don't ask how I found out, ok…).
I didn't go for the suede s.wheels because there are rumours they'll stain
your hands (you know when the get swetty from nasty cornering (^8).
The wheel is to small to give you a good glance at some of the gauges in
your dash, but this can be solved easily by rotating or twisting the gauges
a bit, so you can see the most important parts of 'em.
You do need a hub, and there also is an extra spacer unit available (which
I don't have). Just check that out, I think it would be nice… but it all
comes down to what you personally prefer.
Don't forget to order a hornpad also, they are available with the Porsche
crest.
You also might wanna check out the Sparco s.wheels.

Well, hope I was of any help…
good luck!
