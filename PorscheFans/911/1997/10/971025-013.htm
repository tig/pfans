All -

The Rohr 911GT1 is there it is just covered up in the back of their pits. 
Guess there was a multiple car incident on Thursday which the Rohr car was
involved in.  Seems one car lost an oil line and left many quarts of oil
on the track.  Along comes a few cars and they are started spinning.  Some
were luckier than others.  But hope is not lost for them.  They have
received the Porsche team car #47 for their use this weekend.  They are
doing very well in the car and even had top time in group for a while on
Friday.  Guess the car has a few items their cars doesn't :-).  Early on
on Friday, Porsche was 1, 2, 3, and I think 8.  At the end of the day,
they were 1, 4 and 6 with a Mercedes sitting in the 2 spot and I'm not
sure what was in 3 and 5 (probably another Mercedes in 3 or 5 since they
had the top two time for most of the morning sessions). 

The WCS cars were turning times about 1.2 seconds faster that the GT1 
cars in the last session on Friday afternoon (1:17.9 versus 1:19.1) with 
Ferarri on top.

It was interesting watching the SCCA GTA (Nascar style) cars run around
the track with the GTS-1/2/3 cars.  Some of the GTA cars did a good job
keeping up with the GTS cars and there were some interesting combinations
driving through turns three and four where I watched this group from.  
The GTA cars basically slide through the corners while the others drive 
through the corner.

Nice day on Friday with only one incident out of turn 10 which didn't 
hurt any cars badly.  Weather was perfect with no fog in the morning and 
the daytime temperature around 75 degrees.

Won't have a chance to go back on Saturday or Sunday, so maybe someone 
else can report some information from those days.
