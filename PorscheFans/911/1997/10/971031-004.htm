Ed says: So, how can I rehearse/practice/train safely to cope with T.O.?  What 
     should I do?  Should I find an empty/secluded parking lot and some 
     cones?
     I appreciate any input and thank you in advance for your cooperation.
     best regards,

I think it's important to realize that these reactions to what the car
does in various situations need to be automatic.  The stuff happens
too quickly to count on being able to think about it and remember
what you read or the advice that someone gave.  Anyone who pushes
their car at all on the street or has spun and isn't sure why should
go to about three drivers schools a year.  That way you can gradually
work up to having automatic and instinctive reactions to the handling
of the car, and feel more confident on the street.  It requires
repetitive practice, lap after lap after lap; at least it did for me
and that's the learning theory that is used at the drivers schools.
Aside from that, you'll have a great time and enjoy your car in
the way that it was meant to be driven!
