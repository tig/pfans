Marc Belanger asked for comments on Bruce Anderson's class.

I have attended the engine overhaul, transmission rebuilding, and major tune up
class offered by Bruce Anderson and Jerry Woods. My experience with them was
excellent, they are very good teachers.  The class was structured in such way that
it is real "hands on" teaching. In addition to building confidence by actually
rebuilding a complete engine and transmission, you also learn many of the "tricks
of the trade".  Bruce and Jerry are keen to share their knowledge that is based
upon decades of experience working on Porsches.  

I am pleased to say that I rebuilt my 3 litre engine and 915 transmission using
the instruction provided by Bruce and Jerry and that the car has seen at least 9
track events since the rebuild. So far so good.

I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who would like to single-handedly
rebuild their engine or transmission.  If Bruce could conceive of a post graduate
course to offer on these or other topics I would sign up without hesitation.
