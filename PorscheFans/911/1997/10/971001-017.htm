I considered a Borla, B&B etc, but was scared off by cost, rumors
of quality issues and too much noise.

I ended up with SSI's, and a debaffled OEM muffler on  my 3.2.

At idle it sounds stock.  On acceleration it's loud (kind of raspy
as opposed to boomy) but not as loud as a Bursch (per seat of pants
noise assessment process).  Cost was OEM muffler plus 150.00 debaffling.
You could use an Ansa or any other OEM alternative to reduce cost.
BTW: Debaffling involves  cutting open the back and welding shut half
of the muffler.

It looks stock unless you have some kind of custom tip welded on.

Should last as long as OEM.

Good luck,
