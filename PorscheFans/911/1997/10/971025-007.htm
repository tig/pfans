This *will* work, however, I'll get this caveat out of the
way right now - each 911 is different - what fits on some
cars may not fit on others.  Your best bet is to find a friend
with the sizes your considering and do some test fitting.
The 7x15s generally work in the rear.  I had to roll my
fender lips, but once this was done, 205/60s and 225/50s
fit without rubbing.  Both of these sizes fit in the front
easily. (in fact I've got 245/45-16s in the front now without
any problems...)

>Some say 8x15 with low profile tires will fit.

I doubt it.  The only way I could see this working is if you
used some special offset 8s.  Basically, you'd need to
put the extra inch of wheel width on the inside.  Having
said that, I would like to see if 245/45-16s on special
8x16s would fit the rear of an early car...

>Others say 7x16 will fit....

Yes, but the same caveats apply as with the 7x15s.  A
205/55 on a 7x16 is alot larger diameter than a 205/60
or 225/50-15, so you sometimes run into problems
with this.  Again, test fitting is in order.

>I would like to know if anyone knows for a fact...

Go back to the above caveat.

>The fenders are all original...
>I'm looking for a set of the wheels that will fit.

Good luck.  I would say that 205/60s or 225/50s on
7x15s all around is about the best you can hope for.
