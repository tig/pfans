Here's an alternative:

Use a window curtain rod, the type which consists of two approximately
C-shaped pieces, one of which slides inside the other. The two are
connected with an adjustable, spring loaded clamp.

Adjust the rod to a length slightly longer than the distance between the
two hinged cross members of the top. When you put the rod between the cross
members, the spring loading helps keep it in place and applies the
appropriate force to the clips.

On my top, this fix significantly reduced the rattling/squeaking between
the top and the body.
