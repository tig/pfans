Only 1/2 of the '72 production year had the forward oil tank?  Your
mention of that is the first I ever heard of that.

I believe the '72 911S did come with the front oil cooler.  On my '72 T,
there's a second hole in the bottom of the oil tank for a line to the oil
cooler.  I believe the other line goes into the assembly where the oil
filter attaches.

For track use, my mechanic has strongly recommended the use of DASH-16(?)
lines since he feels the DASH-12 lines are too restrictive for the amount
of oil that should be moved through the cooler.  This is for a car that
will see lots of track time around the Southwest.

From the descriptions I remember, the assembly where the oil filter
attaches to the car has to be machined to allow a thermostat switch to be
inserted.  The sending line then runs up to the cooler mounted in the
right front corner of the car and then back into the oil tank.  I'm not
sure what you need to protect the oil cooler or how the lines are secured
in place.
