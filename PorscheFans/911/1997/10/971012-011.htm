A harness bar will work and is reversible.  I bought one for about $80
from Automotion http://automotion.com or if you would like a real pretty
one for more bucks, try getting a Brey-Krauss.  One source for a B-K is
Engine Builders in Reno/Sparks, Nevada.  There are others.  See Pano.

Then for your camcorder mount, there are a number of makers.  I have a
IO Port that I bought from Engine Builders.  I can't remember the price
but it was a bit more than the bar.  It comes with a strap to keep it
secured.  Again, B-K makes them too.  I cannot see any issues with this
setup regarding safty.

And I think that my setup has already paid for itself.  At my first
timetrial, Hurley Haywood asked me if he could drive my car and demostrate
how to drive an all wheel drive correctly around Thunder Hill.  I said
noway, nobody drives my car. Yeah right!  He was almost the first driver
to drive my car since I bought it -- only missed by an hour.  And I caught 
HH on video.  It's priceless.
