 Robert;
Had the same thing happen to mine '78SC.
This is a mechanical problem.  There is a small gear that runs the 
odometer, and it's stripped.
I'm from Dallas took it to a local speedo shop, they took it apart and 
fixed and cleaned the speedo. cost $95 as I remember.
I took it out of the dash myself. Its easy, just jiggle and wiggle it 
side to side and it will walk its way out.  Its not mounted with clips 
or screws, just the rubber ring that holds it in place. It might be 
easer to remove the steering wheel to do this. Just pull off the 
center horn pad, there is a large nut that you unscrew, and off it 
comes.  Don't remember the size of the nut, just do what I did, go to 
a Home Depot pull the pad off go inside and buy the socket and take it 
out and try it. I got it right the second try.
In the back of Exellence magazine N. Hollywood Speedo 817-761-5136 
quoted $125 as I remember, but I think any competent speedometer shop 
could do this
