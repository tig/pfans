Hey everybody.  This is my first post to the list and while I don't
currently own a 911, I hope to be looking and buying one in about 1 year
and wanted to learn everything that I could before that time.  My dream car
is a 993 Turbo, but I'd be happy with many of the 911 family.

In response to Jerry's note about Nitrogen in tires, I worked with the PLC
Direct racing team at Elkhart Lake, WI over the CART weekend there and
Goodyear fills their race tires there with air (which two guys on our crew
promptly dumped in front of the Goodyear guys after the tires were mounted)
and then brought the tires down to our spot in the paddock.  There, they
promptly refilled them with nitrogen.  The reasons from them (they have
about 40 years of racing time between them and from what I have heard
elsewhere) nitrogen is better for several reasons.  As mentioned, low
moisture content and because the gas is homogenous and does not vary from
fill to fill or tire to tire, it also makes pyrometer readings more
accurate for checking alignment and how hard the car is working on the
track.  If you watch the CART races, you know that they often talk about
changes of a 1/2  pound PSI to help prevent blistering, etc., and that
small of a change is just not accurate with plain air.  For street driving,
there is probably no real detectable difference if you check them often (if
there is, just stop and wait for the cop to get to you), and there may be
a difference in auto-x, but there are good drivers that can beat a lesser
one using nitrogen in his tires, but I don't know about how the
pro-auto-xcrossers feel about using it in their tires and how many do.

Neat info Jerry.  Goodyear has some really neat tire info to pass on.

Andrew
