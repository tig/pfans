I went to the 911 engine rebuild class about a year ago.  I generally
agree with Terry Williams--it was a worthwhile class and I would go
again.  My only advise is that, if you are planning to rebuild a motor,
plan to take the class just before you start the rebuild process.  This
will help keep the mountain of info fresh as you take on the project. 
In my class, Jerry Woods tore down and rebuilt a motor while the class
of 8 or 9 watched--Jerry explained in great detail what he was doing and
answered all questions in detail.  There was no "hands on" in my class,
however, as it sounds like there may have been for Terry Williams.
