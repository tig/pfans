Hello all,
I hope everyone's morning has been going well.  Mine could have started off
poorly but fortunately for me did not.  I had just pulled onto US 41 S here
in Evansville, IN heading to my office.  The 930 was already warmed up and in
order to merge into the morning traffic it was necessary to accelerate *a
little* more quickly than most other cars would.  So there I am clipping
along at a good 70 in a 45 zone, passing an old lady in a Cadillac and a slow
moving semi when I look over in the N bound lane and see a purple 1998 Camaro
getting on the brakes HARD.  As I pass him he turns around and begins to
accelerate at a very rapid pace as I watch him in my rear view mirror.  I
take my foot off the gas and fight back the instinct to tap my brakes.  I
merge into the right lane and wait.  My radar detector was on the entire time
and never made a sound, so I wasn't too worried.  After it catches up the car
pulls slowly beside me and a uniformed IN state policeman looks over at me.
 I look at my speedo and it says 50 mph.  I see him looking at me out of the
corner of my eye but I don't ever look over.  I see him shake his head in
disgust as I smile and he takes off down the highway.  The rest of the drive
to work was uneventful, but I'm sure the state police will now be on the
lookout for a young blonde guy / menace to society in a black 930.  If they
could only be on top of shootings and bank robberies as soon as they are on
top of me when I exceed the speed limit by .05 mph Evansville would be a lot
safer place.  Oh well.
Have a good day.
Brian Buxton
