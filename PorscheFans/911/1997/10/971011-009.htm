-----------
Scott, about four years ago, somebody introduced such a wheel--primarily
for the hot rod market.

And I figured if they could find folks to pay the $1000-1200 for it, they
would eventually bring the price down and broaden the marketing, but as
near as I can tell, they disappeared.

I suspect it was a combination of lawyers getting in the way and going for
the wrong market.

I'll proablay be going to the SEMA show in November this year, so if I find
someone is offering such a part, Ill report it here.
