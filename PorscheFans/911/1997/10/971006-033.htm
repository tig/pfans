Since oil coolers and sizes are topical, allow me to throw a question
into the fray: what size is the RF fender mounted Terbatrol fittings?
AN-16?  I'm trying to figure out what adapters, reducers etc I need
to mount a front cooler re-using my existing lines.    Anyone BTDT,
what length hoses did you use with what size cooler?   I can get
pre-made stainless double braid hose with end connectors at a
reasonable price but the lengths are fixed at 18", 24", 36" etc.

I'm also looking for at least a 25-row cooler which must be less than
7" inches high (any width)  to fit my front spoiler.   The coolers in the
racing catalogs have the inlet/outlet in the wrong place.   Are the
Rx-7 coolers big enough for track use and are the inlet/outlet on the
side?

Thanks for any input,
