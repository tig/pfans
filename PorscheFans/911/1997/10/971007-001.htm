Hello Brian, I have just completed mine and a friends RHD 911 conversion.
Are you planning to do this all yourself? Not many parts are really needed
if you are good with sheetmetal. Most of the people selling RHD parts in
Australia are extremely expensive and I needed very few parts in the end.
By the way how much did the SC cost you once you got it here? Is it in good
condition? I bought a 76 911s from an importer in Adelaide in January and
am wondering how much you save doing this yourself.
	Regards, Dean.
