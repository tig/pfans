A friend with much better cash flow than I has asked me if $44,000 is a good 
price on a '92  911 Turbo Coupe, in very clean shape with 57,000 miles on her. 
I told him I thought it probably was a decent price, but I thought I should 
consult the Porschefans Oracles on this one. Is the '92 a good year for the 
Turbo.? I have not seen the car myself, so can not tell if car has any 
evidence of bumping into anything etc. or not. But friend says he does not 
think so. Are there any particular weak spots for this model that he should 
check into ? (wish I could buy it myself, alas...)    thanks. RWC.
