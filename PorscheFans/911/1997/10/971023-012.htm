----------------------------------

I'm running 7 X 16s on the front of my 72T. I'm running 205/55 section
tires, In order for them to clear my (lowered) car, I had to roll the front
fender lips. I would not be able to fit 225s on this car.

I have put RS flares on the rear, so I can't help you there.

I am running Fuchs 911 alloys, but there are 944 versions with slightly
different offsets that might fit differently, so you might want to discuss
it with several folks, and test-fit wheels if you can borrow 'em. Porsches
do vary up to 1/4" side to side--especially 25-year old ones.

YMMV
