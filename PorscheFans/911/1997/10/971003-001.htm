Sorry for the late response but I felt this was important
information.

It is easy to install a 5-point harness in a 911, without
drilling, and keep
the 3-point street harness fully functional.  Here's how, for
anyone
interested.
 1. Install a harness bar to anchor the shoulder belts....
*****************************************************************
***************

I had a thread about harness guide bars a while ago dealing with
this very
thing and I also talked to a lot of people, especially tech
chairs for PCA
drivers events. The results are as follows... There is only one
bar that allows
you to attach the belts to the bar, and that is the one sold by
Automotion. It
has a patented attachment system that prevents rotation of the
bar under load.
This turns out to be the key. Even though the Brey-Krause bar
could probably
hold up your car they will tell you not to use there bar for
harness
attachment. All other bars on the market tend to be quite poorly
executed -
most restrict seat movement because they go straight across from
B-pillar to
B-pillar rather than going rearward first.

Note: some regions may give you a hard time if you attach the
harness directly
to an Automotion bar. If they do just remind them that the
manufacturer says to
mount them this way and you'll change them as long as they sign
a form
accepting liability for contriving the manufacturers
instructions. They'll back
off real quick.
