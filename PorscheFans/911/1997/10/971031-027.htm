For the sake of my experience and testimony here, I am going to assume that
your normally asspirated coupe was not an all-wheel-drive (like your turbo)
because other than the power difference I would be surprised in as
significant a difference as you indicate. Having track driven both a stock
993 (rear wheel drive only) and a stock C4S (AWD) I must say these were two
totally different cars.  I have not driven the twin turbo (sad but hopefull)
however I hope these comments purely regarding the differences are usefull
anyway.

I could hustle the 993 around the track but at first felt that when trail
braking and throttle steering it was a little less responsive than previous
911's because this new breed was designed to keep the rear end more in line
than ever. However the limits were definately extended and once I was used to
the rear end correcting (the feel reminded me a little bit like the Mazda GT6
with the rear wheel steering) like it was on rails I just got on the gas a
little earlier, a little harder and stayed in a little longer and suddenly it
all worked really well.

On the other hand the C4S would do everything in its power to fight what I
was trying to do. I could feel the power shifting from back to front when I
would dive into turn 2 at Willow Springs which created a huge shift in the
slip angle from creating a lot more understeer than I wanted. It was fun to
play with and feel all the power transfer happening - quite an engineering
marvel - but I have to say it was not condusive to the fastest lap times. It
is better than the earlier C4's which had in my opinion obscene understeer
but it still fought me all the way around the track. I found myself actually
driving more like a front engined car with an earlier apex - which in my
Carrera would mean revolving a few times.

For driving at the <~85% level I think the Porsche AWD is fantastic and fun.
The turbo must be another leap year in enjoyment and I hope to try one
sometime. But as far as driving at  the limit the available 100% is more
enjoyable for me in the two wheel driven variety. I would love to try a C2S
now!

Congratulations on owning the best car in the world! Hope you are able to
enjoy it to its fullest!
