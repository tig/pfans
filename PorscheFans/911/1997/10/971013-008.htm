Oh great experienced ones... is Slick 50 treatment considered taboo for a 911?

Generally people consider SLick 50 as snake oil and stay away from it.  There
are at least two products though, the Engine treatment, that goes in with the
oil and the fuel treatment.  I used the engine treatment in my Turbo Supra
many years ago and it subsequently began to leak oil, unrelated, perhaps...
but with the 911, I recommend just using a good oil and change it regularly. 
Regarding the fuel treatment, I have used it in my 1980 911 SC with good
results.  It definitely smoothed out the idle and the top end, even my wife
noticed it.  My mileage improved a little also.  My wrench recommended it. 
Since my car is 17 years old, it probably had some "varnishing" on the jets. 
The fuel treatment is designed to clean this out.  Since your car is not as
old, your results may not be as dramatic as mine were.
Incidently I tried it in the 912 and the Explorer also.  I noticed basically
nothing in either of those cars.
Good Luck
