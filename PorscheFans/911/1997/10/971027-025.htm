After returning home (barely getting there in a snow storm) and putting
the studded snow tires on my SC, I looked up a formula for computing
spring rate for torsion bars.  Being unwilling to lie on my wet garage floor
to measure anything, I used some bits and pieces from a 68 front
suspension.  I measured the lever arm of the A arm to be eleven inches. 
I think this dimension has never changed.  I measured the stock front
torsion bar I had saved (aha - it was of some use) from long ago at
22.25 inches between the splines.  I then calculated the following
equivalencies for front torsion bars in millimeters and front coil springs in
pounds per inch:

19 --- 130
20 --- 160
21 --- 195
22 --- 234
23 --- 280
23.66 ---- 310

My 912/911 windshieldless Targa  race car came with 310 coilover
springs on front, and 375s on rear, for what that is worth.  I bought
some stiffer rears  4 years ago, but have never tried them, as this
combination seems to work pretty well.  I get outpowered,
out-aerodynamiced, out-driven, and out-foxed in Club Racing GT4-R, but
never obviously outcornered.  I didn't calculate how to compare rear
torsion bars with rear coil springs (which requires figuring in the
different lever arm).  I didn't figure in the effect of the angle of the coil
springs, although I noted that the cosine of 10 degrees is about .98 or so,
so it may not matter.  Also, if someone tells me I have this all wrong, I
won't feel offended.  I don't often use the 4th power on my calculator,
although I think I got it figured out.  Not every reference gives exactly the
same figure for the modulus or whatever of a steel bar - I used
1,120,000 whatevers in making these calculations.
