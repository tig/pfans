I am hoping some of you more mechanically inclined folks out there can
assist me with a problem I have encountered.

The following occurred to me last Thursday:  While shifting (at 4200)
from second to third I felt a miss in the engine, the yellow check
engine light came on simultaneously, and from the engine compartment I
heard a dull knocking.  I drove the car home, about 1 mile, parked it
and had it hauled away by the dealer the next day. Calling in today to
check, I was told upon the mechanic starting it up on Friday the same
thing happened (the knocking), and the yellow check engine light was
still on (steady, not blinking anymore)and that the diagnosis was a
hydraulic lifter sticking. The mechanic did nothing more it seems on
that day (Friday). Monday they started it again, the light was off, and
the knocking was gone.  Same diagnosis.  I was told that no harm could
have been done, and if the noise or light doesn't come back on that will
be the end of it.

My questions are: 
a. From what I have detailed does the diagnosis sound reasonable? 
b. Have any of you experienced any hydraulic lifter sticking problems?  
c. Should I have accept the premise that after such an occurrence with a
brand new car that "everything is in good order"? This is the second
time that the "check engine light" has come on, and I AM concerned that
I am getting lip service. The dealer is not a huge retailer of Porsches,
and has four other marques that he sells and services. The first time I
was told it was "bad" plugs, they reset the light, and changed the
plugs.
d. If this has happened once, is it likely to happen again, and again?

Any similar occurrences, advice, or what have you would be greatly
appreciated.
