Howard Volin inquired about the size of tires that would fit on stock 
bodied 911's.

I have a 73 911.  It now has 73 Carrera RS flares in rear, but 
originally had the non-flared wheel wells.  I could run 225X50s on 7X15 
rims,  but found that it required upgrades on the torsion bars and 
shocks, and about 2 degrees of negative camber on the rear, before it 
would work.  If you have a concours paint job, stick with 205's.  The 
225's rubbed just enough to bubble the paint in the right rear, and the 
fender lips had to be severely beaten (oops, rolled) before the tires 
wouldn't rub in front.  Still, hard turns such as you would find in a 
parking lot, could induce rubbing in the front.

Hope this helps.
