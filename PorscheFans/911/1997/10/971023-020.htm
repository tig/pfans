You can't at the dealership, but if you go to a Bosch retailer you can buy
the solenoid seperately. Of course, at a Bosch retailer you can buy the exact
same starter(less the Porsche sticker, but it's still OEM) for about 60% of 
what the dealership wants. When I priced them the entire starter was about
twice the cost of the solenoid alone, but since you've got to pull the
starter(and I'd like to slug the dimwit who spec'ed shallow socket recessed
6-point bolts for that app) to replace the solenoid, I figured what the heck
and just replaced the whole thing.
