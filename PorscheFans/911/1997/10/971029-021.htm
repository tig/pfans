I have to say that in my understanding based on quite a few notes I've read,
Warren is quite correct...

As I understand the situation, as the width of the tire increases, the
flexibility of the tread also increases. This can lead to the tire 'ballooning'
at high speeds, leading to excessive centre tread wear. I'm not sure if
sidewall stiffness plays a part as Warren's mechanic suggests...

Increasing the pressure counteracts this tendency.

> 44 PSI sounds a hell of a lot for any road car tyre,used _on the road_.

It's the recommended inflation pressure specified in the owner's manual
for normal street driving in a 1990 911, at least (that's my 1-car control
group ;^). Rear 44, front 36. It sounded like a hell of a lot to me too,
but it is Porsche's recommendation, and my tires so far wear dead straight.
