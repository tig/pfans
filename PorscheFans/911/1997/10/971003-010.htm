First I would like to thank Walt Fricke for his continued dialog on this
subject.

Walt, I tried this by fabricating a system using 1/8" vacuum line and some
plastic vacuum connectors.  It does knock down the pulsations, unfortunately
there isn't enough vacuum to move the vacuum retard mechanism.

I have researched this issue further, and there is a very good description
of how the factory provided vacuum pulses in last months Pano.  If you
closely examine the Weber 40 IDAs there are castings in the carburetor body,
opposite the mixture screws, below the throttle plates, which appear to be
ideal for the vacuum retard.  A good illustration of this is also in last
months Pano.  These "ports" are located on cylinders 1, 3, 4, and 6.  If you
look at an intake timing diagram this would provide almost 360 degree vacuum
pulses.

Now, I ask myself, self? Do I really want to drill and tap my carbs for 5
degrees of vacuum retard?  I don't have a small enough pipe thread tap, the
vacuum barbs, etc., little stuff really.  The carbs are off the car and
completely disassembled sitting on the bench at this time.  I'm cleaning
them for that typical idle pop problem when the idle circuits get dirty.

The bottom line.  I reassembled the carbs put them back on the car and
adjusted them.  I'm very good at this, just ask the neighbors, and look at
my knees... and I set the timing at 5 degrees BTDC so I can obtain 35
degrees advance at 6000, again ask the neighbors.

The moral of the story is that is just to difficult, and that's probably why
PMO tells you to just remove the vacuum retard line.

Again, any other suggestions are welcome.
