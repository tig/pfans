Joe,

I had both a Momo wheel and a Personal wheel in my 911's. Almost all
aftermarket wheels are smaller in diameter than the factory wheel. Measure the
wheel and compare it to the aftermarket ones ( they tend to give there size in
millimeters )
Smaller wheels are nice for quickening up the steering but they do increase
effort ( minimal amount ) and block the gauges. The tack will still be visible
but the speedo and the oil level gauge will be partially obscured. I rotated
the speedo to see the range I was interested in and the oil level gauge is not
used when the car is not idling anyway. The Personal wheel I have now is 350mm
and is about as small as I would suggest in a street car. The Momo wheel I used
was 365mm and this difference is quite noticeable. 

<< I read that the MOMO needs a hub (at an extra cost) that will enable it to
make clearance on the car.

All wheels need a hub. One great benefit of a new wheel is that it will allow
you to pick the clearance from the dash to the back of the wheel. This is done
by picking a wheel with different offset's ( similar to tire wheels ) and
adding spacers. Right now I have 2 1/8". I got this clearance by using a Momo
hub, a Momo to Personal adapter and the Personal wheel. There are many possible
combinations of hubs, adapters, spacers, and wheels to get what you want. Your
best bet is to find a car with one in it as a starting point or call a company
that deals in Porsches and tell them what you want - they should be able to get
you set up. 

Anyway, I think you'll like an aftermarket wheel, the thicker rim is more
comfortable to my hands. I have only one caution - many wheels now have these
'hand shaped' rims. Personally I find them very uncomfortable unless you always
drive around with your hands at 9 and 3 o'clock. Since I drive at 10 and 2
o'clock they were totally unacceptable. They also are much thicker than normal
and do not have a round profile - you should try one before you buy one.
