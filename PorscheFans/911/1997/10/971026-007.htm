Hello P-friends,

Well, friday was D-day, or what they called the October-evolution… The
official presentation of the new 996 at the dealer. So finally we saw the
new car in the 'living flesh'. 
To tell you the truth I wasn't much pleased with the pictures I'd seen so
far on TV, in the press or on the net. Because it's always hard to get a
good impression of a car's look (like it was on the Boxter and the 968) I
just waited patiently until I could really see, touch, feel and breathe the
car. But I still was pretty skeptical about the general impression I got so
far.
Let me first tell you that ever since my dad bought his first (used) 924
about 16 years ago (I was 11 back then and my dad never owned anything else
than a Porsche since) I'm a heart and soul P-fan, and even though I've got
my personal favorites (don't we all), I really like all models (even the
924 with it's 'Audi' engine). I.M.H.O. each model has something special,
that makes 'em deserve a certain amount of respect. I can say I've
(test)driven most models, 924, 924 turbo, 928, 944, 944 turbo, 968, 3.0
carrera, SC , 3.2 carrera (which I own myself) and the 964-C4 (still
waiting for a chance in a 993). But about a year or so I started having my
doubts about the Porsche designers. Personally I found the Boxter somewhat
of a disappointment (from a design point of view - I think technically this
are only getting better every minute the think of something new in
Weisach/Stuttgart). We all know, saw or have the prototype-model of the
Boxter that was presented at the IAA 2 or 3 years ago. I loved it right
away! I found it very up-to-date, really liked the new headlights and front
fenders and I just loved the rear end of the car (which my girlfriend
looked so good from behind…). Actually I thought it would be the perfect
'new 911'. But that was the study-model or prototype. Basically the final
production model didn't change too much from it, but what was a real
disappointment to me where the sides of the car they were just STRAIT
(remember the beautiful curves on the prototype and that great looking
air-intake low in front of the rear wheels). Where were the wide
fenders/wheel wells that give Porsches that great aggressive look? I've had
mixed feelings about the Boxter ever since… The other design mistake (as
far as I'm concerned) was the 993 targa. Like the other models I fell in
love with the 993 right away. The more tilted headlights and the awesome
fenders, this even looked more aggressive than the 'old' turbo. This car is
just screaming muscle all over! But (again I.M.H.O) the targa was strange
concept. It's a great piece of engineering, no doubt, but where did the
targa-bar go? After all those years (and very often copied or imitated by
other manufacturers) they just tossed it out, exit targa hello 'giant
sunroof'. The only thing I like about the new 'targa' is the wheels…
And then friday evening the moment was there to get an honest impression of
the 996, the new 911, the 'October-evolution', ready to take the 911 into
the 21-st century. After a short speech and a video presentation it was
time to remove the covers off of the cars in the show-room (with the
appropriate drum rolls from the drummer of the jazz-band that was playing
there, to build up the suspense). All air-cooled models where there in
silver paint, the 356, and all 911's up to the 993 (an awesome sight, I'll
tell you that!) and then, finally revealed to our small crowd (the
happy-few?) there it was, the brand new 996. There were two cars there, one
in black, with gray leather interior and one in a dark/greenish color with
a tan/gray interior. While everybody was jumping into the car right away, I
took my time to walk around it, taking a good look at it from every
possible angle. The first impression was that it wasn't as bad as the
pictures I'd seen so far, but to tell you the truth I didn't like much of
what I saw… Like you all know, the front of the car is the same as the
Boxter (which isn't necessarily bad, actually I think it's the only good
part of the car). The backside is something I (maybe, very maybe) could get
used to, even though it's HIGH and funny looking (the rear bumper is way
above the ground, somewhere in the middle of the cars overall height). The
thing that really damages the 911 shape is the shape of the roof, it's
weird, so called to give more room to the people in the back seats (which
also look funny). Worse of all (in close competition to the shape of the
roof) is the side of the car. It is even worse than that of the Boxter.
Some how the managed to make it even more strait-looking. The interior
isn't much to brag about either. Very little imagination from the design
department here (again). It's a lot like the Boxter but than again maybe
even more boring and cheap plastic looking (and this car had for about
$25.000,= of extra options & accessories). Well, to keep a (by now very)
long story short, the 996 is a big disappointment (to me at least). I'm
sure the technique used underneath is great (well… a car that has a
tendency to understeer?), the brakes are great and personally I think if
it's better to have an air-cooled engine let it be so, but the overall
looks of the car… Naahhhh. I think it's more for the Mercedes/Lexus crowd
(no offense), nothing much left that reminds of the great Porsche racing
heritage. I guess the only spectacular car on the Porsche list left is the
GT1 8^), better start saving!

Well I've waisted enough band-with by now, so I'm off (in my 'real' 911).
Oh BTW, I'm sure there's a lot of folks who disagree with me, so feel free
to pass me any comments, arguments or flames… (let's have some fun here).

Bye…
