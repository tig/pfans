Ross wrote about his 90 c2: 

Transitioning from a completely-shut throttle to an open throttle seems
to involve a brief (1/10th second? less? more?) hesitation. 

My '89 3.2 does it also, althought I think we have different throttle
bodies - mine flows air top to bottom, and is a simple 4" or so 
throttle plate, with the micro-switch, TPS, and WOT switch.

The factory manuals say that there is a two part throttle linkage,
designed so that the micro switch will open BEFORE the throttle
plate moves - this is a difference of 1mm or so - I have trouble 
believing the engine designers found such a difference with this
setup to warrent its extra complexity...

Anyway, my micro switch does NOT perform like the manual says -
because it's adjusted wrong (I suspect) when my throttle linkage 
moves, the micro switch AND the throttle plate both move at the 
same time, against what the manual says...  I have not had the 
time to adjust it (I plan to remove it from the engine), so I can't 
tell you yet if this fixes the hesitation...

If I just blip the throttle from the engine compartment, theres the 
same 400ms delay (ok, I have not timed it...!) before the engine
RPM's increase - just slightly annoying.

If I compare it to my Honda Interceptor MC (bad idea) the 4cyl
Honda roars off idle as soon as you start to think about touching
the throttle... I want that here also!

Good Luck, and hope this helps!
