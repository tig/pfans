Greetings PFans!

It seemed like an easy job at least in looking at the new parts in the box
from Automotion...  

While doing some brake work recently on my '72T, I noticed that the rubber
"covers" (?) on the tie rod ends and the ball joints were split and in
generally rough shape.  Coincidentally, I noticed that Automotion's Internet
site had the Turbo Tie Rod kit on sale (a great time to upgrade from stock,
right?).  So I ordered the kit and 2 new ball joints.  This past weekend I
set out to install the new goodies.  Needless to say, I ran into a few
problems that I hope someone can help with.

1. The castellated nuts came off the tie rod ends easily enough, but I could
not for the life of me, get the threaded ends to pop out of hole.  What's
the catch?

2. At the other end of the tie rod where a single bolt attaches it to the U
shaped part, I was able to get the bolts out without too much difficulty,
but in looking at the Turbo version, it appears that the U-shaped part needs
to come out as well.  It looks as if it should unscrew.  I tried....  Again,
what's the catch?

3. After failing miserably at the above, I tried unsuccessfully to get the
large nut off the bottom of one of the ball joints.  I saw someone else post
for help on this but don't recall seeing any responses.  I'd rather not
spend ~$50 on the "special" tool; a tool I'll use for a couple of hours and
then not need again for years.  Any suggestions here?

4. I also didn't have any luck getting the small screw thingy out of the top
of the ball joint.  The nut came off easily, but I couldn't get the screw out.

Where am I going wrong?  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
