Hello, you have indeed come to the Right Place, Saqib...
	I have owned my '81 SC for over 12 years. I have been pretty happy overall, 
the main problem is the poor AC system, which has been trouble since I got the 

car, and does not cool very well even when it is supposedly working fine. 
Otherwise, the car has been pretty good to me, but then I am good to her... a 
happy relationship! I have had to do the clutch and alternator (not unusual), 
and several other minor things as well. The '80 and '81 SC's do not have an 
emissions smog recirculating pump like the '78 you mention should have. I 
think the '79 also had the pump. I understand that not having this pump 
results in smoother running in general, with cooler oil temps as well. 
	I figure my very clean original '81 Coupe with 44K miles, two owner car, 
always garaged, with full leather interior, is, realistically speaking, likely 

worth around $16,000. Of course, it is not for sale, and I personally feel it 
ought to be worth at least 20K.....haha!  The '78 you mention, being a little 
older, 
 is probably worth slightly less, even if it is very nice, so $12,500 seems a 
very fair price. Maybe the owner will take $11,000?  11K would be a nice price 
(for you) on it, I think. Have it checked out thoroughly by a Porsche 
mechanic, it is worth the $150 to do this if you are seriously interested. 
	Then again, I know a guy who got pretty lucky, in my opinion; he found a 
pretty 
decent '80 targa for $9500 bucks, and it runs out OK. Could use paint, etc. 
though, 
and has around 130K miles. So maybe I am optimistic about my car's value. 
Check around. But a really nice car that needs nothing should be worth more, 
as it is so very easy to spend $2000 in a hurry on 911 repairs. But I think 
you will like driving the 911 better than one of those big green 
tractors.... (you work at John Deere, right?) Good luck and Happy Porsche-ing. 
Warren. 
	PS-- a 911 is a very different beast than a 928, DO NOT let off the throttle 
in the middle of a fast turn, unless you want the rear to swing around like a 
pendulum... of course, experienced  911 pilots use this to odd little 
characteristic of 911 handling to advantage sometimes. Just remember the 
engine is in the back....
