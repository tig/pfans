Fellow Porschephiles:

Well, I happened to be in London on business during the London Motor
Show,
which happens every two years. Having the evening free, I decided to see
if the
996 was on display, since I missed it in Frankfurt during its unveiling
(my boss
was on the trip..he beat me to the punch).

The show was very large, with for me from North America, lots of new and
interesting
cars. Hell, they were even selling Minis...

Anyway, I digress. Porsche had a nice large booth, and low and behold, 3
996's and
two boxsters! The booth was by invitation only, but I talked my way in
by my PCNA 
membership and having a 911 myself.

Impressions: Well, I really like the boxster nose, and it looks good on
the 996. I am 
not sure about the read quaterpanels. I spend some time just "absorbing"
the car from
different angles, and it started to grow on me. I did look a little
"japanesish" at the
beginning, but then it slowly grew on me, and made sense. Its beautiful!

The engine is unrecognizable underneath (well, at least to me, and my
car is and
old 83SC), but what they did above is interesting. They lowered the
intakes on
the top, and since they did not need the blower, the engine is much
lower. Then
Porsche dropped the back shelf down and opened up more storage space
behind
the back seats. If you drop the back seats down, they are almost flat
with the back shelf.

Anyway, if you think you need rubber arms to work with the engine on the
old 911's, you 
have not seen anything yet! Given the back shelf is lower, and the rear
trunk lid is 
pushed back, all you have access to is the back end of the engine, about
1/2 as 
much as the old 911. This is not a car for a "do it yourselfer"!
However, the Porsche 
reps in the booth assured me that the engine was very low service (along
the lines of 
the boxster), and this was not an issue. Also, everything was supposed
to be accessible 
from the bottom.

The instrument panel, as we all know, is from the boxster. The car feels
much more roomy than
the older 911, and the pedals are centered to the wheel and top hinged.
(Oh well, that's another
unique feature of the 911 that was turfed). Usual fit and finish. The
dash is pushed forward,
and the knee room seems better. However, I am sure the driving
experience is much more
exciting that sitting in it.

They had a very nice video running on a large screen (20 ft x 10 ft)
behind a 996 on a rotating
pedestal.  Narrated by Patrick Stewart of course, and it documented the
path of a young 
boy chasing a dream at working at Porsche. Very nicely done, and it
really makes you proud
to own one, and after that you want to jump into your 911 and drive!

They also had the whole engine/tranny/subframe/suspension out of a car
and mounted on display.
It gives a good view of the technology of the new engine.

Here are some list prices in the UK. Prices include VAT and are the
retail delivered
price:

Boxster : 33,950 Pounds
Boxster Triptronic : 36,550 Pounds
911 Carrera 4 Coupe : 64,450 Pounds
911 Carrera 4 Cabriolet : 70, 645 Pounds
911 Carrera 4S Coupe : 76,450 Pounds
911 Turbo : 97,950 Pounds
996 Carrera Coupe : 64,650 Pounds
996 Carrera Coupe Triptronic : 67,950 Pounds.

This seem to be much more expensive than the prices I have seen here in
Canada.

Cheers,

MIke
83 911SC
