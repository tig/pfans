Christian:

German cars were originally white, although -- so the story goes --
silver was also used after someone at Mercedes realized that they
could save a little weight by leaving their cars unpainted.

This is only a partial list -- I don't know ANYONE who knows them
all -- of National Racing Colors as assigned by FIA about a thousand
years ago:

Argentina       Blue and yellow
Australia       Green and gold
Austria         Blue and white                          
Belgium         Yellow                                  
Brazil          Yellow with green wheels
Bulgaria        Green with white bonnet
Chile           Red and white with blue bonnet
Czechoslovakia  White and red with blue and white bonnet
Egypt           Light purple                             
Estonia         Blue, white and black                   
Finland         Black                                  
France          Blue                                   
Germany         White (or silver)
Great Britain   Green
Holland         Orange
Hungary         White and green with red bonnet
Ireland         Green with orange stripe
Italy           Red          
Japan           White and red
Latvia          Black with white bonnet
Lithuania       Yellow and green
Luxemburg       Light grey           
Poland          White and red        
Portugal        Red and white                  
Romania         Dark blue and red                      
Siam            Blue and yellow with yellow wheels
Spain           Yellow and red
Sweden          Yellow and blue with blue stripes
Switzerland     Red with white bonnet
United States   White and blue

There were lots of variations... Ferraris driven by Americans were
often red with small white and blue stripes, British cars driven by
Australians had a little bit of gold among all the green, etc.

Dan Gurney's cars were blue and white (rather than white and blue) to
distinguish them from McLaren's white-and-blue cars... Later,
McLaren switched to orange for some reason, and shortly thereafter, 
the national colors became sorta pointless as the cars became much 
more closely identified with their sponsors than with their countries 
of origin.
