Hello PorscheFans

I have been looking for the source of the heat coming in to the rear of
the cabin for more than 6 months now (on and off) and on Sunday morning
I asked my friend to drive whilst I was in the back seat (I'm 6'1" tall
so it was a bit of a squeeze).  She said "where will I go" and I said
"go to Nightcliff and back" because it's a straight-ish road and she
could do 80 km/hr safely.

I found that the heat is coming in through the hole/vent/moulding that
holds the rear right-hand seat belt to the bodywork just behind the
passengers right shoulder.

I'd like to stuff the hole up with something but that might cause the
heat to build up somewhere else.

Any comments on this??  Should I clog that hole up?  What else should I
do?

P.S.  It's amazing that the local Porsche dealer and an expert from
Porsche in Melbourne have looked and looked but couldn't find where the
heat was coming from!  If you can't put oil in it or replace it, some of
these mechanics seem to be a bit "lost in space".  Anyone else suffered
the same thing?

P.P.S. I saw a video clip on our Cable TV Music Channel which started
out with 2 black convertibles driving by - one looked like a Boxster on
steriods and the other looked like the most beautiful 356 I've ever
seen.  Does anyone know if those cars were unusual Porsches?
