Hi Paul -

Take your car to a different mechanic!  No wait... first buy the various
Bosch "Technical Instruction" books on the CIS (K-Jetronic) system, and
read 'em, and THEN shop your car around until you get a mechanic who can
talk sense about the system and what needs to be done to make it work
right.  It is kind of a Rube Goldberg system (hmmm, possible Yankee
vernacular... a term for a not-too-elegant system with many more parts
than needed) but is not too hard to understand.  It takes awhile to sort
through the possible causes of cold start problems, but there is no
reason the system can not be made to work *very well*.  Absolutely NO
EXCUSE for backfiring, that is a MAJOR mis-adjustment somewhere!

The list that Terry Shugart sent you (appended below) covers the basic
things to check; if you don't understand them now, you will after you
read the Bosch books.

Let me know if you have further questions...
