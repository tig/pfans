Hello Phans-

I once again come to you seeking your collective knowledge to help solve a
new problem with my 1983 911SC. This past weekend after driving my car for
about an hour I parked the car, and then about 15 minutes later went back
to it to start and move the car, BUT the motor would not turnover. There
was plenty of power from the battery, (all lights worked, and were bright).
When I turned the key to the start position all I got was a "click" and a
hum. I let the car sit for another half hour, and went back to try again,
but I got the same result, no start.  We got the car running by roll
starting it, and I just parked on a hill for the rest of the day, BUT I did
not need to, the next time I went to start the car, she fired right up with
no hint of the previous problem.

I suspect that the starter is on its last legs, seems to me I remember
reading some time ago the it is probably the solenoid on the starter
specifically, is that right? How difficult is it to replace the solenoid,
(If that is indeed the problem)?

Thanks for any and all help you can offer, it is very much appreciated.
