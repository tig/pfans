i have the corse.. it is amazing.... i would not consider it frivolous.. it
is the best wheel out there..
far better then the stock wheel, (on my C4 at least) it really works in the
design of the interior..
i'm an industrial designer by trade and i believe that there are things
that can be improved upon with the porsche...  go for the seude... it needs
a hub to mount to the factory shaft.. it's not an option.. get the
collapsible  one...  it may save your face.... i also purchaced the lonza
F-1 horn button mod... (funny to think of a mod for a mod) it's carbon
(like) and looks real tech....  to install pry off horn button face... get
a massive diameter like 15mm or something wrench an take out bolt.. pretty
straightforward.... do it in a parking lot where you can drive straight for
a bit so you allign the car and the wheel...
