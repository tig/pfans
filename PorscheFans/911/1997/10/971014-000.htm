Well, when this happened to me (in a '74 911 with a 3.0 in it), I
did all the same things. When I finally pulled out the alternator
and took it apart, I found one of the recitifiers fried like a
chicken. So, one test is to look at the rectifiers. They are in
a semicircle connecting two plates on the front (if the fan is
on the back) of the alternator. You may not be able to tell if
one is toasted, but I will bet that is the problem. I just bought
a new alternator of the next amperage size up (I don't recall
the number now), had my fan housing machined (the bigger
alternators are longer, so you need to inset them farther into
the fan housing to get the pulleys to line up) and am now a
happy guy.
