David, not to prlong this discussion any more than it has to be:

Porsche used the initials "SC" to designate "Super Carrera", at least
internally. The "911 Forever Young" book more than implies this is what
the initials stand for. Paul Frere's book, "Porsche 911 Story" makes the
same implication although les substantially. Considering no one on this
list has Factory memos discussing the naming of the car, this is likely to
be as close to "qualified to answer" as you get. Unless Pete knows...

I can dig up page numbers if you really want. Keep in mind that the 911SC
was an evolution of Carrera 3.0.
