Why do you recommend a non-S model?  About 2 years ago, I bought my '71
911S for about $8,750; there was about 63,000 miles on the odometer,
essentially no rust, everything worked but the cigarette lighter and an
inexpensive a/c switch, everything was in good condition except the
easily replaced lower dash "kick" panels and the door pockets.  My son
and I have had a ball driving in about 15-20 autocrosses and time
trials.  After 15,000 miles and two years of street/track use, the only
required repairs have been a leaking tire valve, new front/rear glass
seals and having to rebuild the brake calipers ($200+time).

I knew nothing about working on cars, but this car is amazingly easy to
learn/work on (I have a very helpful Porsche nut for a friend).  I'm so
mechanically inept that I used to be happy of I fixed more than I broke
-- but this car seems almost indestructible, nothing breaks -- most
things are easy to get to and understand.

OK, I've spend a couple of thousand dollars improving the suspension,
but I still race in stock class.  OK its kind of a dog in city driving
below 3,000 rpm's, but there is great pleasure in beating 10-15 year
newer cars with more horsepower (and more weight) when I can stay
between 3,000 and 7,200 rpm's.  OK  interior noise drowns out the
stereo, but the music from behind the rear axles is always sweet and
audible.  OK the ventilation is remarkably poor, but the windows always
roll down.  OK the fun has also cost me about 5 sets of tires, but the
entry fees are usually only $10-$75 for a day/weekend of fun.  OK
maintenance is more expensive than a Honda, but I enjoy tinkering.  

I don't know how you can get more enjoyment for $8,750!  ....and for
some reason, by 18 year old son suddenly wanted to spend time with Dad
on race weekends.  In the absence of a turbo, does it get any better
than an S?
