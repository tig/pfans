I can't talk to Arco, but ever since gas prices went nuts about a year ago, I
have been using rotten robbie and costco gas in 3 Porsches without any ill
effects. This is a total of around 37,000 miles on the 3 cars, (not on each
car). The cars are an 93 RS America, 83SC, and a 74 914 2.0.
-------------------------
    Time for yet another gasoline question... 

    For daily driving around town, I've always put Chevron Supreme in my 
    P-cars due to recommendations from reputable sources (and the 
    inclusion of some amount of Techron in the gas). But lately gas 
    prices here in California have gotten out of hand, and the price 
    differential between Chevron and Arco is now significant enough that 
    I'm considering trying the Arco...their current ad campaign emphasizes 
    that "there's no difference but the price". Anybody have any 
    experience or knowledge of the suitability of Arco 92 in P-cars? *Is* 
    there any qualitative difference between brands?
