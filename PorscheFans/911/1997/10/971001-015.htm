Hey, all,

Well, I finally assembled everything I needed yesterday to change my oil.
Hardest to find was Mobil-1 oil at a sane price - it's scarce around here,
and the dealer wanted over $9.00 per liter (Canadian). Farzaan Kassam
pointed me in the right direction (eventually ;^) as Wal-Mart had it for
$6.47 per liter. Next time I might pop down over the border and pick up
a couple of cases!

Thanks to Jay Brosnan and Dave ??? (DAger15440@aol.com) for the tips. Dave
saved me from a very messy floor by suggesting an oil pan with an open
top rather than a 1 inch hole!

It took me 2.5 hours start to finish, including going out for a boot before
and after to warm the oil and to check that everything was ok afterwards,
and some time with a turkey baster removing about 100ml of overfill.

What I did:

- Used a short piece of a cedar shake held in front of the crankcase oil
  drain to prevent oil from whooshing out on top of the bottom cover
- Drained oil from crankcase... I let it run for over 10 minutes and it was
  still trickling out - I figured it was draining the oil cooler and lines
  and started worrying that I didn't have enough oil on hand if the cooler
  was drained so I buttoned it up at this point (with a new washer, of course)
- Drained oil from oil tank... WHOOOOOSH!!!!! Thank god I hadn't tried my
  old oil pan with the one inch hole!!! I turned the plug out all the way
  with my ratchet so when it was finally free it was caught in the socket...
  no fishing in hot oil for the plug. Replaced plug, new washer.
- Lined area around filter with towels, removed filter. Towels didn't even
  get a drop of oil. The filter is a bastard to manouver out of it's cozy
  little space with the A/C compressor & lines in the way!
- Replaced oil filter, started adding oil. I got as far as 5 liters and
  remembered Jay's note about going slow towards the end, so I started
  going slow... thankfully, as when I was adding the 5th liter I lifted
  the funnel and oil was all the way up the filler neck just waiting to
  spill out.
- Got 6 liters in, ran the engine for 15 seconds (per the owner's manual)...
  VERY disconcerting to see almost no oil pressure for a few seconds on
  startup!!!
- VERY VERY slowly added 3 more liters, making sure it didn't come up the
  filler neck... it really wanted to.. ;^)
- Ran engine for 30 to 40 seconds, no reading on oil gauge, checked level
  with dipstick, about 1/2 inch BELOW the bottom mark. Hmm - the manual lies...
  looks like I'll need that 10th liter.
- Slowly added 10th liter, started it up, ran engine for 30 to 40 seconds,
  got a good reading on the gauge, checked the dipstick and it's about 3/4 inch
  below the top mark. Good.
- Went out for a drive to check that all was ok - got back and checked level
  again... 1/2 inch ABOVE top mark! Damn. A turkey baster works really well
  to remove the excess - don't tell my wife! ;^)

I feel one with my car now.

And I didn't spill a SINGLE drop on the garage floor! The biggest cleanup was
cleaning my ratchet & socket which held the oil tank drain plug when it
was removed...

Thanks to everyone who sent suggestions...

Cheers!

Ross
