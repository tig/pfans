Ross, thank you for your defense of my stance on higher pressure=lower center 
wear. It does seem to be the case with the Goodyear Eagles I have now, which I 
have been running at 44psi, as opposed to the old Pirellis that died too young 
at 36psi. Of course, an old buddy has pointed out that at age 39 I am not as 
aggressive a driver around town as I was several years ago either, which is 
yet a another variable....I fear he is correct, I have indeed mellowed a tad 
in my old age! (maybe I should trade the 911 in on a Lincoln Town Car?   
....Not Bloody Likely!) 
But I really do think the higher pressure works at making for more even wear 
across the whole rear tread, but this is noted after only about 11K miles on 
the Goodyears. (please note I say MORE even, not perfectly even).       
Warren.   PS- max pressure on Goodyears listed as 44 psi on sidewall.
