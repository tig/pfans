Hello to the collective!

     I have been seeing ads for a module that eliminates points and fits in
the stock distributor housing. In fact Automotion has them on sale right
now. It sounds like a good idea but I was wondering if anyone had another
opinion on this or has tried it themselves. Any words of advice would be
appreciated.
     Also my '73 1/2 911T's valves have been making themselves be heard. I
understand that the valve guide sleeves were made of copper and were only
good for 80-100K miles and my car has 115K with no top end overhaul. The
car hasn't exhibited any power loss or burning oil cloud, just valve
ticking. Has the time come for a top-end/valve job? Am I correct in stating
that you should not be able to hear the valves? The car now sounds like a
VW bug (come to think of it most of the really old 911s I see in Denver
sound like VW bugs).

Many automotive thanks,

Bob H.
'73 1/2 911T
