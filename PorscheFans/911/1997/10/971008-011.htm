Since I am new to this group, I don't know whether it is typical that there
are more questions than answers or whether some Porsche guru routinely
answers some of these particular problems.  I am, by no stretch of the
imagination a P-guru, but will attempt some answers to some questions posed
based upon 25+ years of ownership.

Rough idle - One of the most common sources, especially for CIS engines is
the oil filler seal gasket.  This is a common source for air leaks and is
the most commonly worn out or sealed incorrectly.

What should I buy // Should I buy  - The old axiom still applies. Start
with the amount of money you can reasonably afford.  Buy the newest, best
and lowest mileage car that you can for the money.  Porsches improve nearly
every year.   There are major segments.  1976 and later are galvanized.
3.2's seem to last longer and have more refinements than 2.7's.  89's and
later have assisted clutches, etc, etc.  The state of the art is, in fact,
today's Porsche. An older Porsche than a 1998 will give you years and years
of pleasure and joy and if you are lucky light a flame in your heart and
soul.   The true trick to all of this is to get the flame burning before
your wallet empties.  Selling one because you can't afford it or fix it
will break your heart.  Been there, done that, no fun!!

New car // yellow light - Get this car to someone who knows what they are
doing.  Porsche engines generally work or they don't.  Whether it is a
sticking valve or something else, it is not right.  You bought a new car..
no you bought a new Porsche.  It is not supposed to do what it is doing.
Get it fixed.  Worst case call the zone rep.
