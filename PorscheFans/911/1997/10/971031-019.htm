<<I am interested in a 1996 911 twin turbo, what price should I pay for this
car? What should I look for as far as mileage and what condition should the
car be in?>>

I would count on spending at least $110K for an exceptionally nice /decent
mileage car.  Don't even consider any car that doesn't look like it rolled
off the showroom.  Even 1 year shouldn't make a car look like a used car.  As
far as mileage I would take anythingover 12K miles.  There are a huge amount
of nice TT's to choose from, you just have to be patient for the right deal.
 I wouldn't pay more than $115K though.  If you have any further questions or
would like to discuss me finding you a car give me a call.
