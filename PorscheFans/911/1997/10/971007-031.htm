Buying a 1980 911SC Targa was one of the best ideas I've had. Bruce
Anderson has always said to buy the most expensive Porsche you can
afford. What's nice about the SC series is that it is affordable.

At the risk of being obnoxious:

I purchased mine in 1993 for $9,000.
	Car had 151,682 miles and original owner was hearing grinding sounds at
rear of car (very willing to deal). Prepurchase evaluation indicated bad
wheel bearing. I  replaced the clutch; oil return tubes, air box boots,
seals & seats; installed Carrera Tensioners; replaced LR wheel bearing &
installed Weltmeister shift kit. At 159,555 miles, moderate transmission
rebuild(1st & 2nd syncro's) and resealed the crank pully seal. At
198,572	miles, replaced the CV joints. No major problems since then
(other than a A/C rebuild).
	Current milage 207,050
	oil consumption < 1 quart Red Line/3,000 miles
	NO oil leaks
	Average fuel consumption over last 55,000 miles slightly > 21 mpg
	maintainance costs since purchase: $11,855
	my incremental driving cost is $0.073/mile

The Targa is my daily driver (20 miles each way on surface roads/San
Diego Freeway).
	
The Targa has a bit more headroom, especially if you have growing
children as I do.

Junior High School kids still stare as I drive by (the Bursch muffler
helps).

Even though it's a 1980, at least once a month, someone asks me if it's
new.

The performance (acceleration, handling and BRAKING) is beyond anything
you can buy for $15,000!

Treat it right and it will last forever. My 9 year old has told me that
he expects to inherit it when he turns 25.
