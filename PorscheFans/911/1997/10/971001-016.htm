Don't worry about what it's made from.  Worry about the "GL" number! 
This is (in my feeble understanding) a service rating, like the SF-SG-SH
rating on motor oil, and specifies, among other things, the friction
characteristics of the oil.  The friction characteristics have
everything to do with how well the synchros work, and it is not
necessarily a case of "less friction is better"... what you want is the
amount of friction that the guy who designed the synchros had in mind
when he designed them.  So, look in your owner's manual and see what GL
grade (probably GL-4 or GL-5) and viscosity is specified for YOUR car...
and get yourself any major name brand of the same stuff.

By way of a brand endorsement, the 915 box in my '83 SC has always been
happy with the Swepco oil sold by various Pano advertisers (and
recommended by Bruce Anderson).  As happy as any 915 box ever is
anyway... I think that's about as happy as Kurt Cobain... oh well...
