I suspect a knocking sound is coming out of a rather large cylinder mounted in
the right rear wheel well of my '87, above the oil tubes leading to the front
cooler.  I've looked in the Haynes manual and there is no hint of what this
cylinder is.  Before I try removing it, it would be nice to know what it is, I
think.  It is about 2.5 - 3" in diameter, 8-10" long, connects to the front
(toward passenger compartment) of the engine with two hoses, and has what
appears to be a drainage hose coming out of it.

What is this thing?  Is there something in it that could rattle?  How expensive
is it to replace?

Thanks,
		-Mike
