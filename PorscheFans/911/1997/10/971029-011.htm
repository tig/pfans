This didn't happen all of the time though. >All of the other gears seemed

adjustment ?

I doubt that there's anything wrong.  My 79 has the exact same problem
which can be a real pain in an autocross!  ;)  Other SC owners I've talked
to said the same thing -- it just doesn't like going into first when you're
rolling.  Kind of like the stiff first-second shift, it's just something
that these 915s do.  And incidentally, I think mine shifts better than most
and still has these idiot-syncrasies.  I kinda like it because it's not
like driving your basic toaster-on-wheels.  You actually have to pay
attention to what you're doing and *learn* to drive it well.

Hope it's a good car and you make the leap!  There's nothing else even
remotely like a 911.
