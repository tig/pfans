I need a little help from some of the CIS GURU's.......

Now that the weather has turned cool, I am having a problem with my '80
SC warming up. Any help anyone can give me would be appreciated.

Symptoms:
It seems to be a little harder to start, i.e. it cranks a little longer
on cool mornings before firing up.
Once it has started, RPM's are very low, 600 RPM.. barely running
While it is warming up it tends to want to die unless the RPM's are kept
up with the throttle. 
I sometimes notice a little occilation in the RPM's, i.e. if I hold the
RPM's at say 1200 with the throttle, the engine RPM's increase to say
1400 then settles back to 1200, etc.
After it warms up the RPM's increase and stabilize at the normal 1000
and it runs fine.

My initial suspicions are that it has problems getting auxiliary air
supply and the fuel pressure is out of spec???

So far, I have checked the Aux Air Slide valve and found it to be
apparently working OK. I removed the valve and found it was opened about
1/2 way when the engine was cold. I put voltage to the valves coil and
the valve closed after a few minutes. However the book said there should
be 33 ohms resistance and I found no resistance when I checked it with
my multimeter.

Does the lack of resistance mean this valve is not operating properly?
Seems that if this heater coil were broken it would be infinitely
resistive.

My warm up fuel pressure regulator has been modified to be adjustable,
however I am uncertain as to whether the cool temperatures mean I should
enrichen or lean out the mixture. I have also heard that this regulator
can cause the idle to hunt if it is not adjusted properly.

I am no expert, but suspect that I might have two problems that have
compounded to cause the car to be difficult to warm up in the cold
weather.

Any help would be appreciated?

Thanks
