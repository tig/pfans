If all goes well, I'll be buying a '90 C2 from a friend who had it for 2
years previous. While I feel that I am getting a good deal, I would like to
know how good.

1) What is the market price for a Guards Red/Black '90 C2 with 39K miles,
forged wheels, partial leather?

2) The car has a Autothority chip which I want to replace with the original
due to my concerns about additional wear. How much will performance change?
My friend has been told that he can trade-in this chip towards one for his
993.

3) Does anyone have a "bug-list" for these cars? Exploding dual-mass
flywheels and leaky heads come to mind.

4) Does anyone have a list of option codes and and the location of the
option plate on these cars?

Thanks.
