I am planning to paint a set of cookie cutters.  I was wondering if someone
had any suggestions on the type of paint to use.  I want the centers to be
black and am not sure if this should be a gloss or semi-gloss paint.  Also,
the chrome rim section on a few of the wheels is in such bad shape, I am
considering painting the rims with some sort of metallic paint.  I want the
wheels to look nice but since they're mostly used for the track, I don't
want
to spend the money to have them professionally redone.  Any suggestions on
paint materials / techniques would be appreciated.  I have spray equip if
that route would be superior to the old spray can.  TIA for any help.

The Wurth metallic paint gives the correct color.  I find their clearcoat
nearly "wurthless".  The brake dust seem to pit the clear laquer, and
overall the finish is not durable.  I am having excellent luck with a
system suggested by a buddy that keeps old Mercedes:  MinWax Polyurethane
Spar Varnish, which is sold at ACE hardware and similar stores.  Much more
durable, and shed brake dust with standard car wash.  Rustoleum has a flat,
semi-gloss, and gloss black.  The entire wheel will be glossy if you use
the high-gloss clear coat.  I recommend it.  It is easier to keep clean
than a satin finish.  If it is too glossy, just do a poor job washing, and
soon you will have a dulling film which will look about right for the satin
finish.

I have used spray guns and regular car paint on wheels.  Spray cans are
much less work, and are economical for an item as small as a wheel.

Good luck.  Let us know what you do and how it works out for you.
