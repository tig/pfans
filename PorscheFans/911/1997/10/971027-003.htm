Andrew, 
	I was pretty surprised at your recommendation of " Fix a Flat" in your 
generally very sage post re: traveling X- country. I have read, and also been 
told by tire dealers, that this stuff will permanently ruin the balance on a 
tire, and maybe even the rim itself. Apparently it is resinous goop that will 
adhere to the inside of the tire, thus hopefully plugging the leak. But it 
will also unbalance, possibly permanently, the wheel/tire. It is hard to 
remove once it has hardened on the tire casing, they say. I would sure hate to 
have that stuff stuck forever to one of my $230 tires on its $650 rim. Of 
course, sometimes it might well be the lesser of the evils, such as if one has 
a flat during a snowstorm, or has to continue to drive on the flat for some 
reason, etc..  But of course, maybe my info is wrong, I have certainly been 
known to be incorrect before; certainly the tire dealers stand to lose a 
dollar or two on this... Any one else know about Fix a Flat?    Good luck and 
happy Porsche-ing!      Warren C.
