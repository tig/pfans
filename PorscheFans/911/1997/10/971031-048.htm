Thanks, Hank, for the reply.  
	I use Armorall only occasionally and in a very light application. But please 
tell me of its evil qualities, I am ignorant and untutored, I hang my head in 
shame.... ;-)
	I have been using the stuff for years (10?), so far I have not noticed any 
deleterious effects. But perhaps I am not looking in the right place? Only 
trouble I have noticed anywhere at all is that my passenger's seat is drying 
out along one stitched seam and is just beginning to crack despite my best 
efforts. But as this is one bad panel in the whole car, I attribute it to 
possibly poor tanning or to just plain low grade hide in that spot. Strangely, 
the same place on the driver's seat is ok, except for mild surface wear from 
17 years of being sat upon...
	I have always considered the Armorall a back up, or interim augmentation,  to 
the Hide Food treatment, which I try to do at least twice a year. I have never 
thought Armorall was nearly as good, but as I like to keep the leather 
relatively supple and moist, and as the Hide Food application requires a lot 
of time, I use the Armorall when short of time. 	So, what is the specific 
trouble with occasional Armorall use, if you please. I am all ears.I certainly 
don't want to be undoing the good I work so hard to achieve with the Hide 
Food. Thanks muchly, Warren. '81 SC, w/leather everywhere.

Warren,

I like Hide Food a lot, but would really deeply question the use
of ArmorAll on leather.
