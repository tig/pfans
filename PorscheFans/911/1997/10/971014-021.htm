Andy:  I agree, you are a great mechanic. We who fiddle with our cars
salute you.  Results are what counts, not some old theory.  Though I
sense some lack of the full satisfaction of victory over refractory
machinery, and a worry that the gremlins may strike again.

I believe the cigarette lighter plug-like thing you mention is the connection
between the oxygen sensor (a one wire sensor on Scs, didn't go to 3
wire until the Carreras?) and the mini brain.  I think of it as more like a sort
of headset plug.  It isn't like any other inline plug in the car.  It should
disappear through a rubber grommet in the engine side sheet metal, and
if you look under the engine you should see it emerge and go to the
sensor plugged into the exhaust.  The other end ends up in the loom
which goes to the minibrain.  Since the brain has a reserve program to
use to control the frequency valve if the oxygen sensor fails or is
disconnected, its being disconected should really not have anything to do
with your problems.  Now not connecting the brain at all makes for
problems (though I don't recall them to be quite like yours), but lack of the
oxygen sensor connection (or because it has worn out)  just means the
engine isn't quite as efficient, etc. as it could be.  Not really even
noticeable without instruments on the CIS cars.

I gather you don't think the wires with brittle and cracked insulation were
so bad that they were actually shorting to anything?  Did you check them
with an ohmeter to see if they had lost continuity (were broken) or had a
high resistance?  Even one ohm is indicative that the wire has gone bad,
though I'd think it would take quite a bit more than that to cause problems.

Walt Fricke (81 in a 77), responding to following post:

"The car that lost power over bumps and then refused to start is
now running. I don't know why. The only 'repairs' I made were:
a) replaced sections of the small wires from the coil (called the
'1' and '15' wires I believe) which had brittle and cracking insulation.
b) There is a wire enterning from the left floor of the engine
compartment that is not in a wiring harness and ends in a plug
like unto a cigarette lighter plug. I assumed it had been knocked
loose while wrestling the air blower out of the car so reconnected
it in the general vicinity of the CD ignition module. What is this wire?

Would either of these 'fixes' address the symptoms I saw? Should
I now trust the car to be well? I am pleased to have it running but
somewhat annoyed not to be able to troubleshoot a problem that
is no longer there.

After hearing that the fuel flow at the injectors is supposed to just
dribble, I was all set to have the car towed to the shop. I was putting
back all the removed pieces and thought I'd give the car one last
chance to come to life. Am I a great mechanic or what?

Opinions are solicited.

ps:  I'm also sometimes not getting my daily digests, but the list still
accepts my humble offerings, and I can read the digests on the archives,
so it isn't as bad as the days of repeating messages and being kicked
off.
