Weeeelllll, if there are no holes then the next thing to look for are slots on
each side of the unit itself. You may have
to remove the 'cowling' around the unit first to uncover them. If the unit has
slots, then a pair of narrow letter openers
or something similar should work in the same manner as the coat hanger method
works with the holes. If you don't
find slots, then you have the same problem I am currently having trying to get
my Alpine unit out of my Targa! Anyone
knowing about THIS configuration, please post! The bottom line is that there
are tabs on each side of the unit that
engage with a stationary, cage-like frame, which in turn contacts the dash.
These tabs must be pressed inward (in
most cases), to allow you to pull the unit out. Crutchfield probably sells
removal tools for the newer types of units. I
actually saw removal tools for the older 'coat hanger' variety on sale at
SmallMart yesterday!
