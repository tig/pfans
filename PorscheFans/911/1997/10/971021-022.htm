Todd, they were there in my survey but I didn't follow up much; I'll explain
why below.  In fact, I had some comparative experience with them -- from one of
my own posts a few months ago:

(The Tire Rack top choices I mention are the $200+ tires like Bridgestone S-02,
Yoko Nexus, Pilot, etc.)

There were two responses I did get with direct experience with the T/A ZR's
that spoke very highly of them, and one that was real so-so with a Comp T/A
(specifics of whether it was a Z, or ZR, wasn't available).  Neither of the
local performance tire/suspension shops I talked to mentioned Goodrich tires at
all (one's favorite is the Dunlop D40M2 and the other's is the Yoko AVS
Intermediate).  So really the recommendations tend to run all over the map.

The price of the T/A ZR is about $5-$10 less than the SZ50 and the treadwear
rating (220) is identical.  What swayed me on this choice were two things:

	- One response I got mentioned both the T/A ZR *and* the
	SZ50, and he picked the SZ50 based on his research.  I can forward
	that if you're interested.

	- The pretty large number (~6?) of responses/postings I had with
	direct SZ50 experience (although Mustang and Corvette, no Porsche)
	who were so unusually exuberant about them

Sounds like the T/A ZR is a comparable tire, and slightly cheaper, and should
be high on the list of anyone else looking for a good overall street tire.  Had
I gotten more responses with it I probably would have looked at them in more
detail too.

Thanks,
		-Mike
