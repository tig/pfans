     We took the '89 Carrera which burns too much oil to a recent driving 
     school at Texas World Speedway (Lone Star Region PCA).  We had two 
     drivers driving it each day.
     
     The results are that it burned only 3 quarts over the entire weekend.  
     The trip included two 200 mile highway drives and the driving school.  
     This included several tanks of gas.  It may seem silly, but the car 
     seemed to burn less oil per gallon of gas during this trip than before 
     during city/highway use.

Brian, this is my experience as well, although probably not as dramatic.  I'm
keeping careful track of gas and oil mileage since my '87 purchase a little
over a year ago.  One trend is that both gas mileage and oil consumption are
noticeably better on a track weekend.  In my case, I'm running about 600-700
miles per quart in normal driving (commute: 8-10 miles each way, daily).  On
track weekends I am getting around 800-1000 miles per quart.  Not dramatic, but
statistically noticeable.  When the engine feels a little rough, I'll take it
out in the back roads and wind it out.  Seems to help (me *and* the car :-).
