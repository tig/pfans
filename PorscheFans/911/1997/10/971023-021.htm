Hi,

I posted yesterday about a '71 911E for sale near me.  ...It was embedded at
the end of post about what "SC" stands for, and I'm wondering if anybody saw
it.  (Usually, people respond to my questions, but I haven't heard anything
about this one!)

Anyway, I posted b/c I've been looking for an '87 Carrera for a few weeks, but
it's looking like I might not be able to afford what I want.  Well, a high-end
used car dealer has a fully restored '71 911E for sale, asking $10,500.  I've
seen it - haven't yet driven it.  On the outside, it looks beautiful.  This
dealer is also a fairly reputable Porsche mechanic, and he says they rebuilt
the engine and transmission in the car, and that it runs great.  Absolutely no
rust, as well.

I mentioned to him that it would have to be my daily driver for a while, until
I can get a second car.  He swore that it could be my daily driver for a
lifetime, and he was even willing to offer a warranty on it!  (Don't know for
how much, though...)  I'm gonna go give it an inspection tonight.

Anyway, what do you guys think?  The only thing I've heard "bad" about those
911E's were the hydropneumatic front struts.  Hopefully, this one has been
converted to conventional shocks and torsion bars.  ...Is it feasible to have a
'71 as a reliable daily driver, given proper maintenance?

Thanks for any input!
David

BTW:  Ooops!  I just got a response about the '71 E - so maybe some of you did
see it.  So, if this is just a waste-of-bandwidth-repost, please forgive me!
