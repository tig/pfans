Doug,

I have the same noise in the AC fan of my 84 911.  I took my box apart =
to check the fan.  The fan seemed OK, running silently when not weighted =
from the top by the squirel cage.  However, it made the squeeking when i =
replaced the fan cage.  I think I need a new motor.

To remove the fan and motor, I talked to a local Pwrench who told me the =
blower box is held by four clips only.  The in/out refridgerant hoses go =
through a cutout in the box and are sealed with some pliable, rubbery =
sealing stuff.  Carefully peel back the sealing stuff.  Then slide the =
clips off to the side.  I put some string through the clips prior to =
removing them so I wouldn't loose them if my bent nose pliers slipped.  =
Strings also made them easier to reinstall.  After disconnecting the fan =
power cable, taking off the outlet air hose and _carefully_ removing the =
temperature sensor, the top came off.  The fan is bolted into the top of =
the blower box with four bolts.  Remove them and the cage and fan unit =
come out together.  You can remove the cage from the fan shaft with a =
small ??mm allen wrench.  Finally, four spring clips hold the motor in =
the fan bracket.

I do not know what the spare part would be to correct this problem, =
whether it is the whole fan assembly or just the motor.  I expect the =
OEM part to be expensive.

Regards,

Tom Curtis

Hi, Guys
Question on a 78' SC
  My a/c fan makes a rattling, tinkling noise when the fan is on. The=20
fan seems to work ok. Also when the a/c has run a while in a mild=20
climate the fan goes to squeeling (the most god awful noise you ever=20
heard). Is this maybe the coil freezing the lubricant in the fan?
  I see the fan housing under the access door in the luggage boot. I see
the high & low side hoses, and what I think is the expansion valve. It
looks obivious how the fan housing separates. But the hoses and exp.
valve look to be in the way. Please tell me I don't have to have someone
pump down my system, and remove these items, before I can crack the fan
housing.
  Also can the fan be successfully lubricated?  If not what is the most
economical way obtain a replacement fan, and its installation.

Thanks for any ideas!
