Some follow-up thoughts on a couple of recent posts of mine:

Recovering the Targa top:
Nobody came up with an alternative material, but I had a brainstorm of my
own that I thought might be worth discussion(if for no other reason than
having someone tell me I'm an idiot). Why not recover it in the same material
the Cab tops are made out of? It seems to me that the material in question is
probably water and wind proof, and takes folding/unfolding fairly well. So,
Cab owners... how does this stuff stand up to use? And does anyone know what
the material is(since I don't plan on buying a Cab top and cutting it up)?

Headlight switches:
It's been confirmed(thanks!) that the headlights, and particularly the
highbeams are run direct power through the switches. Has anyone out there
spliced a relay into the highbeam system to try and increase the useful
lifespan of the highbeam switch? I'm fine on the theory, but I'm looking for
some thoughts on where in the wiring loom to actually make the cut to insert
the relay....

And sort of related... Driving lights. I'm a maniac for high-power
headlights. Almost running over a cow on I-15 one dark night sort of
installed the theory of brighter/longer throw is better. Since as things
stand I could probably melt the entire dashboard if I were to indulge myself
with upgrading the headlights, I'm thinking that rewiring the fog light
circuit(already relayed!) and replacing the fog lamps with driving lamps
might be a fine way to go. Anybody have any recommendations for a good set of
driving lamps that will fit nicely where the kind of crummy Bosch Pilot
looking type OEM fog lamps go on a 911 Carrera? I'm looking for something
with a tight, focused long throw... It'd be nice if I could use them on the
Interstate without annoying the heck out of any other drivers I may come
across.

Thanks,
Alex
