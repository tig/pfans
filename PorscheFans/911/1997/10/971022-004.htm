RE:     What does 'SC' mean? (lengthy!)

Hello there fellow PFANS....

I am sorry to raise this topic into the limelight once again but some 
of you across the pond might be interested in an article that was in 
the October issue of the Trading Post produced by the Porsche Club 
Great Britain for which I am a member.

I quote a report written by John Pozniak who organizes the 911 SC 
register....

"There is a belief that SC stands for Super Carrera, or possibly 
several other things. I am not certain one way or the other. In order 
to clarify the issue I contacted Porsche Cars at Reading. I quote 
from the letter I received, in reply, from Steve Walker, Customer 
Relations Adviser....

"After some lengthy checking we are able to confirm that in fact the 
letters "SC" have little meaning. In 1977 the two 911 models produced 
at the time (not including the Turbo) were a 911 2.7 and the 911 
Carerra 3.0, these models were discontinued for the 1978 model year 
and replaced by the 911 SC. The only explanation that we can offer is 
an extract from a book called "The Porsche Book - a definitive 
illustrated history." This book is written by Lothar Boschen and 
Jurgen Barth. I enclose a highlighted copy of an excerpt from this 
book."

Except from "The Porsche Book - a definitive history" by Lothar 
Boschen and Jurgen Barth.

"The suffix SC means that the car lies somewhere between the 911S and 
the Carerra".

Lothar Boschen was a former Porsche employee, subsequent author and 
publisher, now deceased. Jurgen Barth will be familiar to many as 
Porsche, Manager Customer Motorsport and liaison with the FIA also as 
a Porsche race driver.

Steve Kevlin at Cornbury House (home of PCGB) has been most helpful. 
he has used his contacts both here and in Germany to help get a 
definitive answer. I quote from a fax received from Steve.

"I have today spoken with Porsche AG's equivalent to 'the horse's 
mouth'. Jurgen Barth confirms that many people do believe that the 
term "SC" is an abbreviation of "Super Carrera". When you consider 
this on a factual basis it is patently nonsense, as even the most 
ardent 911SC fan would never suggest that it was a "Super" version of 
the car it replaced (Carerra 3.0) or the version which pre-dated it 
by 5 years (the 2.7 Carrera).

Jurgen's suggestion is that porsche were simply taking a lead from 
their own history and, when looking for a model identifier, opted for 
the same term used on the 356 model in the years 1963-65.

It is perhaps worth considering that over the years Porsche used 
other model identifiers which defy any logical application of the 
"appropriate" words, eg "A" for 356, "T" for 911. In addition, it is 
also worth stressing that the term 911SC was not new in 1978. The 
official model designation for the 2.7 carrera of 1973 is shown in 
the Porsche spec. books as 911SC, with official engine designation of 
911SC-F.

I believe this supports the view that "SC" does not necessarily mean 
anything in particular. That such an emotive term as "Super Carrera" 
fits the bill is convenient, but is not correct - and that is from 
the horse's mouth!".
