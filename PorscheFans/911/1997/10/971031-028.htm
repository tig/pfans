Be sure the stub axle nut is on tight (250 ft/lbs) and check the bearing. If
these are fine I don't know what else to check other than making sure the
parking brake is not warped (they have been known to rub and generate enough
heat to warp which would certainly cause some vibration). 

I just suffered a catastrophic failure of the stub axle which took out the
entire hub, bearing and parking brake assy requiring complete replacement of
the trailing arm as well. It also cost me a tire but that was trivial
considering the potential damage if the wheel had come off - note: it was
only being held by the rotor being wedged into the brake caliper. We really
don't know what the original cause of this failure was (stub axle corrosion,
loose nut, ???) but I don't ever want it to happen again!

Hope this is of some help to you - good luck,
Ross
