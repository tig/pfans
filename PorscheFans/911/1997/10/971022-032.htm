Hi all,

Earlier, I posted that I *thought* I had read that SC stood for "standard car",
and I *thought* this information came from Aichele's "Porsche 911: Forever
Young".  But, as several of you pointed out, Aichele actually enforces the
belief that it stood for "Super Carrera".

So, where the hell did I get "standard car"? ...I just realied - it came from
the 911 FAQ!  ("SC - This was the standard car.")  Obviously, the FAQ doesn't
say that it STANDS for "standard car".  But, between the time that I read the
FAQ a year or two ago, and now, something happened in the dark recesses of my
head (strange things happen in there!) that made me think "SC" actually stood
for "standard car".

So, I apologize for any confusion.  And, thanks for you all being so kind in
"shooting me down"!  ;->

BTW:  The reason I was referencing the FAQ (and came across my mistake) was
because there's a '71 911E, fully restored, for sale near me, for $10,500.  I
was kinda curious about that model (not as familiar with it as the "T" and "S",
and I'm really not familiar with those early years anyway!).  Anyway, I've been
looking for an '87 for a while... but I _could_ go for one of the early cars.
 Problem is, I need it for my daily driver for about a year.  What are your
thoughts on that?  A '71 "E" as daily driver?  (I've never driven anything but
SC's and '84+ Carrera's.)


Thanks!
David
