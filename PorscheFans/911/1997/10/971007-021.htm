A local p-car wrench, Chris Powell, diagnosed a similar squeak on my car
as the a-arm bushings. These are rubber and deform as they age so that
the torsion bar is no longer centered and rubs inside of the a-arm. The
solution is replacement. I don't know what the cost of replacing with
the stock rubber bushings is because I got a quote on replacing with
poly-graphite bushings.

Bruce Anderson (if I recall correctly from memory) suggested disassembly
of the a-arms and grinding off the casting seam high spots from the
torsion bar bore.
