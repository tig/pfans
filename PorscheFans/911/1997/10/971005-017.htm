Jeff, in all the 911s I've owned ('76, '84 Turbo-Look, and '95 993), have
found 
I had to lower brake pedal to get it at an acceptable height for heel-&-
toe.  On the 993 I adjusted the turnbuckle unit to lower the pedal position.

Agree that you run the risk of running out of travel if you REALLY overheat
the brakes, but then again I'm one of those stupid drivers who will back
off if brakes start becoming a LITTLE spongy.  I guess smarter ones don't 
do this.

When I adjusted the pedal height, I opened the front bleed port on one
caliper
and tromped on brakes to make sure I didn't bottom the pedal.  993 is still 
a little hard to heel-&-toe in mild driving but under heavy track braking
works
just fine.

To those of you who have no difficulty with heel and toe in an 911, do
you drive a C2 or 993 with power brakes? If so, what is your secret?

I didn't notice a problem until I switched to a power-brake equipped C2.
Specifically before I can depress the brake pedal far enough to reach
the gas pedal the headlights are scraping on the ground. These are some
powerful and sensitive brakes! I tried practicing with the car stopped
in the garage and even then could barely manage a good throttle blip
with the brake pedal down as far as I could push. (Imagine what that
would be like while driving.)

Sure, if you overheat your brakes on the track, eventually the pedal
height will fall far enough to allow good heel and toe, but you only
have one or two laps left before they fade completely--guess how I know!

If you shorten the brake pedal rod, you risk running out of travel when
they overheat, so the only safe way is to raise the pedal height (or
wear those 4-in stilleto heels you've been saving for that special
occasion :-) -- Spearco are you listening?).
