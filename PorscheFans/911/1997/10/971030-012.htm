All,

Last weekend I was fortunate enough to take delivery of a 1996 993
twin turbo.  I'm amazed at the differences in driveability from my
1997 Coupe compared to the Turbo (superbike acceleration of the twin
turbo notwithstanding).

I am wondering if there is anyone on the list that can address specific
questions/observations made since I've been behind the wheel of the
vaunted twin turbo.  Questions that I have involve differences in the
'feel' of things like steering, shifting, and ease of engine revs.
It's almost as if these two cars couldn't have been made with just
a one year difference by the craftsmen in Zuffenhausen.

Certainly, I'm trying to find someone who has driving experience with
both n/a and turbo 993 cars.

Please write me off-line at David.Pancerz@MCI.Com so as not to inundate
the PFans site with my arcane issues.

Regards,

David W. Pancerz
Dallas, Texas
