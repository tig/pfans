Hello from Atlanta!

I purchased a strut brace, the kind that fits over the strut, and am
having trouble removing the center retaining nut.  I have applied liquid
wrench -- no help.  There is a notch in the washer beneath the nut and
my service manual mentions a tool that secures the washer when loosening
the nut, but I have been unsuccesssful at keeping the washer from
turning with the nut.  I have called technitions about using their air
tools, but they have warned me against using impact wrenches (they say
it may damage the strut).  Any advice?

My fuel pump runs whenever the ignition switch is on, even when the
engine is not running.  I am guessing it is a fuel pressure regulator in
the engine compartment between the pump and the throttle body (CIS,
Sportomatic).  Has anyone replaced such a unit?  A similar problem is
warm starting problems.  I am hoping fixing problem 1 will fix problem
2.

I have considered replacing my factory lobster 'shag' carpet.  The
seventies really are over, after all.  I experimented with trimming the
fiber, but my beard trimmer just doesn't do the trick.  I have priced
replacement sets, but, as you have probably already guessed, I am on a
limited budjet.  Any leads on low-cost options?
