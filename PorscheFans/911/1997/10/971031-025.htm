Tubro pump in a 2.7?  There are turbo pumps and turbo pumps.  All will fit
the three studs which hold them in, and line up with the intake and outlet
ports in the case, from what I have seen (don't claim to have made an
Andersonian search of them all, but at least through the 3.2s these
spacings appear to be identical - my '65 aluminum case is same as my 77
mag in this regard, and I have a "Carrera" pump in one of my engines). 
However, the really big one is longer than other oil pumps, and as a
result it requires 1) a shorter splined tube shaft to connect it with the
intermediate gears, and 2) some relief of some of the webbing internal to
the case.  My machinist did this for me, but it looks like a person maybe
could do it with a die grinder.  It is pretty obvious when you lay your long
pump in there what has to go.   No, it didn't leave some webbing looking
feak and weeble and ready to collapse.   3) my big turbo pump also had
a screen attached to its curved pickup tube.  this required a different oil
cover plate - a domed plate with no drain plug.  1) and 3) are factory
parts (don't ask me for numbers, though).
