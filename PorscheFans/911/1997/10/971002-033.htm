Joe- 

I was 22 when I decided I was going to buy a 911. I was 2 months shy of 39 when I 
finally got one. College, marriage, house, college again, work, kids, travel, life-in-general 
kept happening in the interim. no complaints though %^)  

I recommend the following:

0) Study everything you can find. figure $200+ in reading material. 

1) What is a car in excellent condition worth, use the "Excellence" prices as a guide 
find the  years/models that the 'good' to 'excellent' cars are in your price range. 
(9k is going to be late 60's or early 70's T or E). Do you really want a car older than you are?

2) Add the costs for 
    a) pre-purchase inspection by the mechanic you are going to use - $100 - 150
    b) tune-up, oil change, valve adjustment, alignment - get a price from your mechanic
    c) can you afford 2b on a regular basis (10-15k miles) without cutting into your project
        money?

3) Start looking. When you find 'the' car:
    a) if it isn't driveable, don't buy it. Starting with a basket-case will burn you out and
        waste your time and money. You won't have much fun just writing large checks
    a) Compare the asking price to the guide price. Is it in the right range?
    b) have mechanic in 2a estimate what the necessary repairs will cost, round up to the 
        next thousand and add that and the costs in 2 to the purchase price.
     c) 3b gives you a rough estimate of the real costs. Is it still in the range for that car
         and under your budget? Don't be mislead into thinking you can make an 'excellent'
         car out of a 'poor' one cheaply and sell the car for the high-end of the price range 
         so use the 'good'  price range as your target.
        
4) Get insurance quote. Is it STILL under your budget? 

5) If this is going to be a regular car don't expect to get a project-car quality baseline
and have it be reliable. Expect to pay more up front. If it is a project car you will need 
two cars, one to fix and one to use. Can you afford BOTH cars insurance, tags, oil 
changes, etc?

6) Be willing to sell the car the INSTANT you know it is going to cost more than the
estimated value of a comparable 'good' quality car. This is an emotional decision if you
are attached to the car but these things can turn into a hole in your garage you throw 
money into if you aren't willing to bail-out. How much can you afford to lose?

7) If it is a project car, be very, very patient. 18 months to 5 years isn't unreasonable
to fixup a nice car given everything else going on in life. Also spreads the costs out 
(somewhat, everything of real consequence on a 911 is $1k or more, rarely less).

8) Prioritize the work and do one thing at a time. Keep it running if you can but don't get 
in a hurry.
 
9) What else do you want to do while you are working on this beastie? School, music,
girls, whatever.

Good hunting.
