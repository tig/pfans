Saw this and just had to respond.

I just replaced my XGT-Zs two weeks ago with the Bridgestone S02s and I
also noticed significantly less steering effort.  At first, I attributed
this to brand-new tires that needed to be scrubbed a bit.  Well, after two
enthusiastic weeks, they are pretty well scrubbed and if anything, it's
even lighter.  Any idea why?  I was also able to squeal the Michelins
easily and it's taking a lot more effort (read: fun) with the S02s.
Overall it's a vast improvement.  Can't wait to give 'em a real track test.
;)

Only nit to pick:  the lighter steering makes the car a little nervous at
highway speeds (80mph +) and requires a little more care at the helm, but
tracks dead straight.  I didn't know about the Firestones, but the next
time I need tires, I'll be sure to check them out.
