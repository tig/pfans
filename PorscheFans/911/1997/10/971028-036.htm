We all benefit even if just lurking, and that way it ends up in the
archives (which maybe we'll be able to search someday).

My 2 cents on Targa sealing:

First, make sure the clips are tight on the top and that when the top is

opened the folding bars are seated in the clips.

Used a good black silicone with a very wet cloth to rebuild the
windshield rubber and the top side seals.  You must be very patient and
let each bead or coat dry the full 24 hrs before applying the next
coat/bead.  Also I very carefully used the wet cloth to shape and smooth

the silicone.

The next trick I employed involved using marine quality rubber-like
weather stripping.  Without removing the paper covering the sticky side
I carefully slid a piece of the appropriate size between the thick seal
at the targa roll bar and back of the door window.  The length and
thickness must be determined by experimentation as it will compress, and

be hidden from view, with use.  I did have to lay a bead of silicone
behind one of the rollbar/window seals to seal and glue.

Tightest Targa in Texas!  No leaks, and the roof darn near pops off with

the windows up while closing the door!
