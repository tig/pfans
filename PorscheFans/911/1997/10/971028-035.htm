Per Mr. Hubbards query:

The SHO stands for Super High Output.  I also had an 89 SHO.  Darth
Vader model, all black with all available options.  Very comfortable,
great AC and auto temp control, JBL sound system w/subwoofer.  The
engine is based on the Yamaha V-max motorcycle engine which pulls 10's
in the 1/4 mile.  Approx. 2 x 2.25" intake systems with the second one
opening up via a butterfly valve at about 3800-4000 rpm.  All hell
breaks loose.  Motor alleged to redline between 10,000 and 12,000 rpm!?!
German 5sp transmission (Ford could not find one of it's own to take the
torque) that was remarkably similiar in feel to my 84 911.  Redline at
7,000 rmp due to Ford driveshaft and differential.    Replaced brakes
every 18 months.  Rattled like, well, like a Ford.  From 45,000 to
60,000 miles it started falling apart-literally-and I traded it due to
annual maintenance costs exceeding that of my Porsche.

Ron Porter (ronporter1@juno.com) talked about his 89 Black SHO. For me,
and for others who are wondering, just what the "H" is a SHO?
