Any Suggestions!!
I have been restoring my 69 911E and finished the engine and tranny, put
it in the car and the valve covers leak. I then replaced the original
covers with new style covers and used a gasket with a bead of sealer on
it - but still oil drips onto the floor, especially when it is cooling
down. It leaks at the back of the engine (towards front of car). Has
anybody had any experience with this. I know it is a common problem but
I have cured all of the other oil leaks and I would like to get this one
stopped. It really is murder on a carpeted garage floor.  Maybe a double
gasket ot using a supplemental gasket sealer. Help!!
