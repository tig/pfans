According to my '97 manual, the LED will double-flash in the first 10 
seconds, as the system does a diagnostic.  If everything is OK, then the 
LED will revert to slow flashes (about 1 sec/flash).  If everything isn't 
OK, like the time I left my trunk ajar, then after 10 seconds the LED stays 
in double-flash mode, and alarm isn't armed.

Subject: 	Alarm system check

Every once in a while the alarm system in my '91 C2 goes off
unexpectedly.  What I have recently discovered is that since I have
owned the car I'm not sure that it has ever armed properly.  Can one of
you 964 (993) owners confirm the correct flashing of the alarm
indicator for me?  When I lock a door with the key after about 10
seconds and the LED goes into a "double flash" mode (dot-dot-dash).
From reading the owner's manual this indicates the alarm system is not
armed properly.  Can someone describe to me how the alarm indicators
flash when the system is properly armed?

I've gone through the trunk, engine compartment and glove box switches
and they seem OK.  Haven't felt like tackling the CD player switches
yet.  It is interesting to note that even though the alarm indicates it
is not properly armed it is still functioning.  I taped over the hood
switch, armed the system and then removed the tape.  The alarm went off.

The alarm system is a diagnosable component so presumably the fault
code is stored in the alarm/central locking control unit.  Oh, for want
of a Hammer...
