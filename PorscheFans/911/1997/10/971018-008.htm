Another 10/16 note with some additions:

Since the car may set in the garage for a few days this winter, I would
like to line up projects to keep busy in anticipation of next spring.
The car is a '79 930 and I would like to do the following:

1. The leather-covered dash has a tear along the stitching.  The board
under the leather is warp and curved enough that it may also need to be
replaced. Any recommendation for restoring the dashboard?

2. I've noticed some of the black (anodized?) frames around the windows
and the "turbo" tag have turned silver.  Is there a way to restore the
black short of replacing the pieces?

3. Wheels are losing the black paint in the center, years of brake dust
and cleaning have worn the paint very thin.  Has anyone used Wheel
Enhancement or the like with good results?

4. Floor mats are looking a little worn, would like to replace at least
the ones in front.  With this car, you take the floor mats out and there
is bare metal.  Is this normal?  Does someone make replacements that
match the factory style?

5. Where is a good place to mount a fire extinguisher for an occasional
Sunday drive :->?

6. Has anyone tried the Jacobson ignition system?  I've read some of his
papers about his work in perfecting ignition systems and I've seen
products based on his work.  I now see that there is a system for older
911s.

Thanks,
Randy Fiscus
