To all you Targa owners I have inadvertently insulted and upset with my 
blanket aspersion that "All Targas over four years old Leak, and old ones are 
extremely leaky," I most humbly apologise. To those of you that wrote  to me, 
Forgive me , I beseech you...;-)
	I actually like Targas very much. I have had a number of convertible cars 
(but no Targa myself) over the years, and I love the sun and wind, there is 
nothing like an open car on a fine day. In fact I find most convertibles leak 
after a couple of years accumulate. I own an older convertible now, and it 
surely leaks... 
	It is just that I have known several Targas of varying vintage, and each and 
every owner has bitched about recurring leaks, ad nauseum. So when one of our 
English P-fan subscribers recently suggested keeping a nice, older, dry state 
Targa outside in the UK, where it does rain a great deal, I felt it was my 
duty to give him my 2 cents worth about leaks on older Targas. Please forgive 
me, I repent my sin (let no man speak evil of a Porsche on the P-fans 
list...), no offence intended... ;-)    Warren, Good luck and Happy Targa-ing.
