Mystery Solved !!

In March, I solicited the P-phans help in resolving a whistle in my intake
system that occured when the throttle was just opened a little. The whistle
seemed to appear right after I installed a K & N Air filter. A few others
commented that they had the same condition, but it didn't seem too serious.

After reading the recent discussion about K & N filters, I decided to put the
stock filter back in, and save the K & N for track use. When I opened up the
air box, the were 3 bolts resting at the bottom of the box!!  The airbox had
come loose from the fuel injection intake mating surface - the resulting
joint leakage was the source of the whistle.

There isn't much danger of the engine swallowing the bolts, but I'll
certainly check them at filter change time in the future.
