Joe Sommer wrote about small suede steering wheels...

Joe, 

I put a small suede dino wheel on my 89 '911 last year -
its a fantastic improvement over the large stock, pointy-edged
wheel.

yes, you need a spacer, and I added an additional 1" spacer,
cut out of hardwood and painted black, to get the wheel 
closer to me.

btw, this is my one major gripe about the 911's - the f**king
controls are un-adjustable, and IN THE WRONG PLACE!
read all over this (and other forums) about how to move the
pedal controls so toe 'n heel'n is possible.  Me, I went down
to our university hospital, and had my ankle bones shaved,
and my tendons relocated, so now my ankle can flex to 70
degrees, and I can toe and heel effortlessly!

likewise, the steering wheel is too far away, and too high for
aggressive driving - am I wrong that all of  us are driving around
with our knees touching the dashboard?

Anyway, here's the two caveats with the small suede wheel:

1. I drive a lot, and the suede gets kinda gummy from all the 
sweat I put on it - I suggest a comfortable pair of driving gloves
(at least for long drives).  I wish I had done this from the beginning.
I periodically remove mine, and scrub it with suede soap, then I
wire brush it - sounds harsh, but it returns it to soft and fuzzy.

2. You lose sight of part of your gauges.  I overcame this by
'spinning' the oil/temp and speedo gauges, so the *useful*
(70-110 MPH) section is now visible clearly.

So overall, I'm very happy with mine...

Hope this helps,
