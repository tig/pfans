I love the way so many of us get rankled at the mention of mini vans and
suv's.  What a fun subject of debate and "disgust".  Where would the smug 911
owner be if instead of the every day comuter vehicle, everyone drove a
Porsche, BMW, or Mercedes to work?  Instead of a Mini van or SUV, everyone
purchased Laforza or Landrover?  It wouldn't be as much fun if you ask me.
 Part of owning a P car, admit it everyone, is the feeling that we are all
smarter than the guy sitting in his Ford.  For those of you that say, "I only
drive a Porsche for the mechanical experience," you are fooling yourself.
 Porsche's are more than fun to drive in all aspects and we need those 93% of
SUV owners to keep their "trucks" on the road so we all have something to
smile at.  By the way, living in the Northwest and being an avid outdoorsman
spending much of the year in the Olympic Mountains, I have yet to see any
Landrover, Hummer, Pathfinder, Trooper, Passport et al, in the woods.  Ever.
 Period.  I have grown up here and what I see in the Mountains, beleive it or
not include all American SUV, trucks, a few fourrunners, old Landcruisers,
and get this, even a Yugo.  Hee Hee.
