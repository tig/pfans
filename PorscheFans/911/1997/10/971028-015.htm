I recently painted the drivers side F & R widow frames because the black
had worn off on my '79. With some very careful masking and some quality
spray paint, it can easily be made to look like new. I did several light
coats, spraying in the garage and rolling it outside to bake in the sun
in between coats. I'm about the worst painter in the world and it 's
still hard to tell it's not original. As far as the durability, I park
the car outside here in upstate NY(w/out a cover) and after 6 mo it
still looks great. The "proper" thing to do would be to remove the trim
and have them anodized(or some other type of finish), but this involves
quite a bit more time and expenese for marginally better results(IMHO).
