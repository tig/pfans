In June I started serioulsy looking for a used 993.    The only real 
difference I found between a '95 and a '96 was the varioram intake system 
which boosts the hp by 12.    I drove many different cars and could not tell 
any difference on the street.   I was also told by my mechanic that the 
varioram system has had its problems.   I ended up buying a very low mileage 
993 that had one devoted owner at a great price.

BTW not all '95's have the basket handle rear light.    Mine, which was made 
in March of 95,  has the same light as the later models.    The basket is 
not necessarily a bad thing.   My integrated light has come loose and 
believe it or not is only expoxied on to the rear glass.   Seems that some 
triple digit speed did it in.   Hopefully it will stay on during driver's 
school.

Another advantage to a '95 is that it comes with an Alpine audio system 
which is superior to the Porsche branded Becker that comes with the '96.

Good luck.
