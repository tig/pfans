I hope some one can clarify these numbers for me.

I was checking out a potential purchase today, a 1980 SC. The VIN for
this car is 91A0131271.  My understanding is that this is a RoW 1980
model.

Where I'm confused is with the engine number. It is 63D0077. The
engine type code is 930/10.

Now now understanding is that the 930/10 is the RoW 3.0L for 
1981-1983. 

Doesn't the D in the engine number refer to 1983?

Or would it be possible that the car was built late 1980 and took 
the 1981 engine and I have the year screwed up?

Maybe the engine has been replaced?

Is there anywhere on the car that matches a VIN number to a 
particular engine number?

Does anyone know if there is someone out there that can give me a
definitive answer on this? Porsche in Germany maybe?

Hope someone can help me out with all these questions

thanks

terry
