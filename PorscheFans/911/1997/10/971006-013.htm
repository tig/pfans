PFolk:

For the gentleman who inquired about owning an SC...they are great cars
with engines known for their durability.  I have had mine for 7+ years
with very little maintenance required.  It still has only about 33K on
the odometer, but I am told that even high mileage examples are still
strong runners.

If I were to replace it now it would be with an 89 Carrera, but I am not
inclined to make the switch just for an easier clutch and some more
ponies.  Its pretty fast in its own right.


To everyone else:
I am contemplating pulling the engine on this car this winter to replace
the rubber centered clutch.
My questions:
1	Is this not better than waiting for it to let go?

2..	Do I really need an engine stand to do this work?

3.	Could someone send me the directions for the engine removal that
I saw posted here some time ago?  It had to do with using a frame of 4x4
and jacking the engine down a bit and then the car up and over it...or
something like that.

Thanks.
