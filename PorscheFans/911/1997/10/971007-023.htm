Not being terribly gifted in the restoration side of life, I had my 87 
Targa top "professionally" reskinned a couple of years ago (note the car is 
in Manhattan, Kansas so there are not a lot of Porsche top specialists 
around.  The guy who did it is good but it could have been a Ford for all 
he cared.)

Here is my problem.  Ever since the reskinning, I have had problems with 
wind noise coming in from the front center area around where the two inner 
clips are.  After months of various frustrations, I have concluded that the 
eight clips that hold the  front and back folding cross members are not 
securing the cross member to the top.  In fact, while driving I have had 
one of the cross members' clips come undone.  Needless-to-say if you are 
going down I-70 in January at a reasonable speed and it is zero outside, 
you realize why you want a good seal.

For the past year or so, I have thought that I just didn't have the right 
clips in the right place (four have spring clips in them, four do not.  I 
have tried the four with the spring clips in front, in the back, two in the 
front, two in the back etc.  Still I have problems.  Other than this issue 
I really have had no problems with the top.

I bought the car new and plan to keep it for a long time so I would like to 
get this fixed.  Any suggestions?  Where are the clips with the "springs" 
in them supposed to be?  I understand there may be some larger clips 
available.  Anyone know a good source.
