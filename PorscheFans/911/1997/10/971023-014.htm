     Few days ago somebody asked how to disassemble sideview mirror. I 
     didn't see any answers.
     
     I have 911SC -80 and need to disassemble drivers side sidewiev mirror. 
     If somebody knows how to do this, could he/she post it on the list.
     
To remove the mirror, you have to remove the little rubber plug located at the
top of the base of the mirrror.  i used a sharp pick.  Inside is an allen
screw that drives a "hook" along that same screw which fastens to a hole in
the door.  Loosen the "hook" just enough to remove the mirror assembly from
the door, but not enough for the hook to come off the screw.    The mirror
assembly should come off.  Electric mirrors will have cables running into the
assembly through the hole.  If your mirror is loose, take a LARGE flat head
screwdriver and tighten the nut underneath the base of the mirror.  (turn
upside down to see)  BE VERY CAREFUL  WITH ELECTRIC MIRRORS NOT TO PINCH THE
WIRES TOO MUCH)  Reattach in reverse. Incidently the left and right are
different size allen screw if I recall correctly.
