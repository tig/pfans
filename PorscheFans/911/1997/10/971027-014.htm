Andy,

It's great to see that the themes on the list follow the weather patterns.
I asked a similar question recently after getting tired of mopping water
off my seat and floor.  Now I find solace in the answer or at least comfort
in having company.  It appears that a few targa owners stay dry and that
the vast majority have a wet leg.

FWIW, my targa leaks precisely where you describe; at the joint just above
the fixed window.  I have looked carefully and on mine, it appears that the
water actually travels along the top of the fixed window frame before
dripping inside the car.  I'm looking a two courses of action.  First
extending the "rain gutter" so that it overlaps with the windshield frame
and doesn't end at the problem area.  Second, I plan on building up the
seal in this area so that the water cannot enter.

Anyone else interested in starting an off-line discussion about reducing
leaks on the targa.
