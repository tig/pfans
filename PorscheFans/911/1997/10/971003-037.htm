Subject: 911 speaker sizes

If your '86 and '83SC are like the front doors of my '69, you might try
installing larger speakers. My speaker openings are 5 1/4" too, but I
installed a 6.5" Infiniti speaker with no problem. The cone size for these
speakers is 5 1/4" and that's what drops into the opening. The speaker flange
mounts on top of the metal door panel. My set were "separates" so I installed
the tweeters in the fabric area above each map pocket (in the footwell). The
crossovers are hidden in a crevice behind the tweeters.

Installing larger speakers should increase the bass/midrange response. I have
a Moch 1 enclosure for the rear speaker shelf (I got used) but try to put
your best speakers in front as this is the best (and most realistic) imaging
direction. The rear speakers should be used to provide rear fill and not be
the primary source. I would invest more money in the front speakers than the
rears.

Audibly yours,
Sherwood
