It's just a guess but when I owned a EURO BMW 325I which had very 
similar DME, it too had what looked like a small potentiometer on the 
PCB. In fact it was a mult-position rotary switch with a small 
screwdriver slot in it.  One position was for leaded fuel and one was 
for unleaded but the other positions - who knows? maybe different 
octane ratings??? I do know that there was a performance degredation 
if you selected the unleaded position.

There must be some members on the list that can give us more 
information on these DME units. For instance does anybody know how to 
hook a PC into its JNAT port!!!!!????
