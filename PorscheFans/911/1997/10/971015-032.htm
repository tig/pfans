I'm coming into this thread a little late, but I thought I would chip
in my '88 Targa pedal-adjustment experience, and pose a question.
Read only if you have lots of time (and possibly an aspirin or two).

I was looking at buying a second accelerator pedal and mounting it on
top of the existing one to bring it more in line with the brake for
heel and toe downshifting.  After reading the thread about adjusting
the brake pedal downward, I tried it.  It was really easy, took about
half an hour to do the adjustment and another hour to clean ten years'
worth of dust and grime out from the pedal assembly. ;)
I had to remove the fast pedal to get the wood (!) floorboard out to
gain space to work.  After that, just adjust the brake linkage and go.
There is a huge range of adjustment, so any other mods should be
unnecessary.   Have the engine running when you test the brake height.

The difference is amazing.  This car is SO easy to heel and toe once
the pedals are lined up.  My old 944 was never easy; it didn't rev so
quickly.

Sort-of related heel-and-toe Question:
Someone wrote last week that the "blip" was more of a stab than a
precise movement, and that's how *I* have always understood it.  To
downshift:
1)Brake
2)Clutch in, shift to neutral
3)Roll onto throttle and BLIP it, the release it. Clutch up and back
down quickly during the blip, still braking,=20
4) Shift into gear, press down on throttle to reach the appropriate
RPM range, clutch out.=20

By this point you may be trail braking, or just back on the gas.  At
any rate, you're in the right gear.  This (I think) should also be
easy on the synchros.

Here is where the confusion comes in.  I just read Bob Bondurant's
book and he does the following:
1)Brake
2)Clutch in, shift to neutral
3)Roll onto throttle and squeeze it down. Clutch up and back down,
still braking.  Throttle is HELD down at the proper rpm level.
4)Shift into gear, clutch out.

This approach changes the "Blip" into a precise rev-matching squeeze
down on the accelerator that you carry through the entire shift.  I've
tried it and found it to be much harder, but something that would be
doable with practice. =20

If anyone's still with me this far, please comment on which is
preferable (both in speed and wear-and-tear) and why. Or does it even
make a difference.

Eagerly awaiting a huge debate,
