Jim,

Well, if you're registering 2500 I'd think we'd better find a solution PDQ
:-))

Absolutely.  Porsche has a long history of fighting with temp, oil flow
and oil pressure.

Yes, but most of those people are designing systems for much more
tolerant environments.

I used solid SC lines (which are bigger inside than AN-12, which should 
be our first clue) as they fit more neatly and dissipate some heat.  It
was relatively easy to get this plumbed in, having to modify a couple
of the engine hoses.  The SC lines terminate in a trombone cooler.
This I gave back to the boneyard.  Found a source for Porsche-AN-16
adaptors (Kevin Buchler, Performance Wholesale, 707-935-5883), 
and used these on the ends of the SC lines.  Then ran AN-16 lines
to the Mazda RX-7 cooler in the front of the car.

Keep in mind that, in a way that is not intuitive, hydralic resistance
has a lot to do with the length of the restriction, not just the
diameter.  (Thanks to Soren La Force who gave me a small
tutorial on this).  So a 3-4 foot run of AN-12 may be a lot worse
than a point restriction that is even smaller.

I'm not saying that what I did can be proven to be necessary.  I was
getting a bit annoyed at pounding out the rod bearings on the car
every year or so and did everything I could think of to get oil flow
(cooling had always been OK).  So far the car is very much happier.
