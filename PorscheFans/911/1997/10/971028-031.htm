Devin plans to install a new tranny and clutch disk this weekend, and
wonders what he should do about his flywheel.  He says he has to have
the car running come time for work Monday, and has the weekend to do
it in. 

Well, resurfacing the flywheel sounds like more than you can bite off in a
weekend on top of R&Ring the engine and tranny.  if your old clutch 
wasn't slipping, shouldn't need it.  If it was, maybe, but probably the
pressure plate is bad also in that case.  You will get a good look at this
when you are in there after you have taken the pressure plate off.  It's
your call on how badly grooved is too bad.  My limited experience says if
clutch wasn't abused, flywheel surface is probably OK.  If you have
some spare time, you might do something like break any glaze with very
fine sandpaper, but this may not be time well spent.   Shops always
want to replace all of this, because they know if something goes wrong
short of another 100,000 miles, they will be blamed.  If we are willing to
spend our weekends being a mechanic on our cars, we can take
calculated risks in this direction.  If our time is worth more than the
commercial repair rates, decisions are easy.  I am in the former group,
alas.

However, the factory procedure calls for replacing the flywheel bolts, so
you'd need nine new ones of those to hand if you do decide to take the
flywheel off.  Very few machine shops are going to be really good at
refacing these flywheels, and are you going to find one which will do it
on Saturday?  Still open by the time you have wrestled the engine out
and removed the flywheel?    the trick is to reface all the way over to the
far outer edge with a nice squarish cut at the edge, so that the pressure
plate will fit down flush with the whole new surface, and not be in
essence shimmed up a bit by an outer ring of uncut old surface.  If your
compliant machinist hasn't done these for 911s, you might want to take
the pressure plate along with you, so he can see how square (nothing is
really square) he needs to make the cut out there - i think there is a little
camfer on the edge of the PP to deal with this.

If you are really worried, why not get a used flywheel ahead of time and
have it ground flat.  Or get one which doesn't need it.  Get a pressure
plate also.  Have both of them balanced and take a chance on the ring
gear - its a pretty symetrical part.  All those guys who put in lightened
flywheels have a perfectly good stock flywheel sitting in their garage
amongst their other treasures, maybe someone would part with one.

Other issue is balance.  I think the cranks are usually zero balanced
(don't depend on flywheel etc for their balance), but it is usual when
changing flywheels to balance the flywheel and ring gear and pressure
plate as a unit.  Maybe if you purchase all these parts (flywheel and PP,
anyway) new the vendor will have balanced it all?  I tend to get used
stuff, which I never trust for balance, and with race engines you get
paranoid, despite fact 911s are pretty well balanced anyway.  My
balancer always finds something to grind or drill as part of his bill to me.  I
prefer to zero balance all of these items separately so one can mix and
match in future at will, but that is probably excessive for a street car.  All
this requires a trip to the balancer.  And one of those guys will be really
hard to find on a weekend, far less give you one hour turnaround.  A
saint you know, maybe?  

So - put your new clutch disc in and be done with it.  If the flywheel (or
the pressure plate, for that matter) looks like hell, you can either resign
yourself to other transport for a couple of weeks while you get things
lined up, or you can put it back together and drive it while you line up
new parts, then spend another weekend (easier the second time) taking
care of this business.

would it, in a DME 3.2, so he's continuing to hoard)
