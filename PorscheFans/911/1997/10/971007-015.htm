To the guy who wants to buy an SC and wants to know
what they are like to live with:

BEWARE::

The cars themselves are fine and a great value: Durable,
reasonably comfortable, retain value well if taken care of, etc.
You will find that the car is one of the most amazing combinations
of art, grace, sophistication, romance, and technical excellence.
You will know why these cars were never intended to be for everyone,
but to be everything to some.

The car will exceed your expectations.

YOU on the other hand are likely to take on the unmistakeable,
and unavoidable characteristics of a <insert heavy organ music of doom>

911 OWNER !!!!!

You will find yourself suddenly above everyone:  brushing
off casual well wishers like Stephen Segal in an ambush.

You will never  wave or flash your lights at any other
person in the automotive food chain.

You will scheme to buy a Boxster as quickly as you can JUST
SO YOU CAN BE RUDE to the first  wanker named DC
who approaches you in a gas station in his 951.

NO act of rudeness or contempt will be beneath you.

Every lane change you make will be perceived by someone
as an incredibly snobbish and selfish move.  God forbid
you should ever need to merge into a tight lane.  Your
every act will be living proof that Porsches and Porcupines
are indeed different.

Face it.  THe mere fact you are *considering* a 911 means you
are already lost forever.  Prepare to say goodbye to all your
previous friends.

Your only hope is to find a GERMAN language chain letter and forward
it to all the CORVETTE and MUSTANG owners you can find.

This may help.  Otherwise, Good luck.
