Were there any other list members at the Daytona HSR this past
weekend?  Because of scheduling, this was the first HSR event I have
been able to attend.  If you love Porsches, this was the place to be.
I was crewing on a car, so I did not get around much until this
afternoon.  Off the top of my head there were 906s, 908s, 910s,914s,
917s, 935s, 962s, and more 911s and 356s than you could count.

I just got back from the track and I am pretty tired.  I'll write more
and hopefully have some pictures to post on my and our regions web
site in a few days.  I would like to hear comments from anyone else
that was there.
