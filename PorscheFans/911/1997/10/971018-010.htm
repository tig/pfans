When I was looking for a replacement for my wrecked '86 911 last year, I
drove several '87s and '88s. They felt flat and lifeless compared to my '86. 

I theorize that the retuning of the '87-89 motors that yielded a few extra HP
came at the expense of low end torque, but am not positive. 

I would up buying a low mileage '85 that exhibited some of the same flatness,
but the rest of the car was in such good condition, I couldn't pass it up. It
turned out that this car had a "homemade" chip in it. I replaced it wiht a
Weltmeister chip from Automotion (it was on sale last fall for ~ $220.)
 which transformed the car. It is far more responsive, and has a LOT of
midrange power at part throttle, which is how one typically drives around
town. I love the "cammy" surge that comes on starting at 3500-4000 rpm. Can't
say that top end power is that much different, but it may be. Only drawback
is that the redline is raised to 7000 - I would have preferred it remain at
6200, as it's pretty easy to hit in first gear.

Smoking at startup of a car that was shuttled around the dealer's lot would
not be surprising. As long as it goes away when the car warms up, it's not a
problem. Mine smokes the next day if I've started it to roll out into the
driveway to wash and then put it away without reaching operating temperature.


Hope this helps.
==============================
Anyone have any comments on my theory about the flatness in the midrange of 
87-89 cars?  Obviously my experience is limited to only a few vehicles.
