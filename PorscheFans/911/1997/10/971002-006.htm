I recently got a XW version of the Third Foot based on the suggestion of 
some others when I had the same problem.    What is not apparent from the 
picture is that it raises the level of the pedal as well as increases the 
area of the pedal for what Vic Elford calls "pedal dancing."

The jury is still out as I try to get used to it.   I find the closer pedal 
annoying since I cannot move the seat back too far and still comfortably 
fully depress the clutch.   I may end up putting a block on the clutch as 
well.   I also have to adapt to using a side to side motion with my foot as 
opposed to using my heel on the brake and my toe on the throttle as I am 
used to on my other car.   You can also use your heel on the throttle and 
your toe on the brake using the third foot but I am trying to get used to 
the side to side motion.

Wing Engineering was very helpful and was prompt in sending the Third Foot.  
 The instructions are not as detailed as I had hoped but the device is easy 
to mount and figure out.
