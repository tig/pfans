Hey fellas:

	I currently own a '78 911SC Targa. I *love* the car, but would 
like to get a Turbo car some day, while keeping my SC Targa. I was 
thinking of buying a motor and rebuilding it over some time and 
eventually putting it in a car to "create" a 911/930 Turbo. This process 
will probably take several years, due to the cost factor and limited 
funds.	
	So, the question is, what makes a turbo car a turbo? Is it the 
standard 3.0l, 3.3l or 3.6l motor with a turbo charger on it? Can you 
convert any motor into a turbo, just by adding on some components? I'm 
guessing not, but I thought someone out there might have some comments 
or suggestions for me. Also, does anyone have any estimates on the cost 
of this possible turbo motor rebuild? How involved is the Porsche motor 
as opposed to another non-Porsche motor? I have been involved in a 
Austin-Healey 948cc rebuild in the past - during my "pre-Porsche" years.
	Any thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated!
