Hello fellow Porsche enthusiasts!

I am currently researching the purchase of a 911.  I think that early spring 
will be a good time to make my purchase.  I can spend about $15,000 and have 
money left over for insurance and any common repairs (timing chain, etc.).  
Upon the advice of Porsche owners, I've purchased some Porsche reading, 
including: Bruce Anderson's "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook."  Also, I've 
been advised that the SC is a particularly desirable model in my price range.  

I would like some anecdotes (from those who have SC experience) about 
ownership and day to day life with an SC.  I mean, isn't Porsche ownership 
like adding a family member?  It would be helpful if you could tell me 
if you would have done anything differently.  For example, would you have 
spent a little more money to get a later 911 model?  Also, how do you feel 
about targa's vs. coupe's vs cabriolet's?  I personally like the classic 
styling of the coupe!

Thank-you,

Christian

PS: can anyone tell me what the German racing color is.  I mean, British is 
Green and Italian is Red, but what is the German color?
