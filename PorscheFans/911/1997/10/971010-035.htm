i had my clock replaced by my mechanic on a 90 C4 as it had a problem (the
internals, not the clock, as it has all the warning systems on it) and was
not letting the alternator fully reach the coil at rpm's below 2k.. odd
that it works that way.... it was resulting in poor throttle response.. i
was wondering, since i have an extra clock now, would it be tough to
convert to a desk clock?? i need the pin-outs of the unit though... it most
likely has something that drops the voltage down to something smaller from
12vdc to ?? for the clock... i could bypass that (are those two big
resistors on the backside for that?? ) maybe run  it off batterys??
-any ideas??? i could do a direct plug in @ 12vdc and not bypass the 12vdc
area and run the lights as well hmm...

-comments??
