<< I am new to this list and also new to being a Porsche owner.  I recently
 bought a 1975 911s and have fallen in love with the car.  I have done a
 little searching but have not been able to find the exact number of
 silver anniversary Porshes built that year.  I have found it difficult
 to find detailed information about the 1975 silver edition Porsche  in
 books or on users web pages.    >>

I owned a 75 Silver Anniversary when new.  Except for the silver and black
cloth seats (which I loved!) and the rear opening quarter windows (an option
still available during the period) there was nothing special about the car,
other than you got the Silver Metallic paint at no extra cost.  The car was
actually priced about the same as the 1975 base 911S and lower priced than
the prior year 1974 911 base model.  About the only option I got was forged
alloys ("cookie cutters" were standard).

Supposedly there were only about 500-750 (#  varies with reference) built for
North America and a similar number for the Rest of the World (ROW).  Nothing
special about the numbered plaque, they were mailed to the dealers and often
to owner's separately and the number you received had nothing to do (usually
with the production sequence of the car (my dealer just mailed them out in
any order to buyers when they came in.)

In spite of the "bad" reputation of the 2.7 litre cars, mine was fine.
 Purchased for $11,700 new and sold for $15,000 thirteen years later still in
like-new condition...not bad, eh, negative depreciation!
