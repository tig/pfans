I have a 72 911T that will be geting a fresh 3.2 .  I will be needing to
install a front auxillary cooler ,but because the car is a T model, there are
no factory lines running to the front.  Also, I am fortunate enough to have
the 1/2 year production that included the oil tank mounted fwd of the right
rear wheel. Can anyone help me with advice on what to do about this situation
? I have the first set of factory manuals, but they conveniently overlook the
72 oil line topic. 

It has been suggested to go with a new oil tank in the commonly installed
(rear) position and then route the lines to this, but this idea seems to come
from those who are unfamiliar with the 72 layout.  I would really like to
keep the original setup because I enjoy explaining why my car has 2 gas
flaps, and I am hoping someone knows how hook this thing up.

Specifically:

Which cooler is best
Where do the in/out lines connect
What type hoses to use and how to route them
Any other misc. details/hints

Many thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out with this problem
