I finally completed a transmission swap on my '71.  Just as I finished
patting myself on the back, I discovered that the car would not start.  I
double checked all of the electrical connections (there aren't many on a '71
with carbs) and determined that there was no spark at the plugs.  My big
question is whether there is supposed to be power at the positive lead (lt
blue with yellow stripe) on the coil when the ignition is on.  I am guessing
there should be.  My test light showed no action when I tried this.  The CD
unit seems to be getting power but the lead going  to the coil is dead.  I am
wondering if I accidentally killed the unit with moisture when I pressure
washed the engine compartment.  I took the CD unit off, opened it and made
sure everything was dry inside.  It had a sticker on the back of it that said
"repaired 7-8-89" which also makes me suspicious.  Any help/ideas would be
much appreciated.  Do people really repair these units or do most people go
aftermarket on CD units?

Thanks,
