Jim:
Mike Willis suggested that you were hearing the turbo wastegate as it
dumped boost... He may be right, but my guess is that you were just
hearing the sound of straight-cut transmission gears being revved up as
the cars were downshifting.


Folks:
That was indeed the wastegate.  We have heard this before on other
racing vehicles that have turbos.  You will always hear it when the
driver is backing off the throttle.

If the gears sounded like this the car would get parked pretty quickly.
