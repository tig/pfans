The 2nd (new) edition of Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook has some
information on the 964 and 993 repair history (actually not much on the
993s since they're pretty new).  Plus a whole lot more.

Hello P-fans

Ok I had the alternator rebuilt & replaced the voltage regulator meter . But
the idiot light is still coming on & my batteries aren't holding a charge.
Batteries check out just fine there is still something not letting the
batteries charge or draining them.When it was hooked up to the voltage meter
it did show a -1.6 at idle.
But everything else was ok. So after checking the batteries out & charging
them I put them back in & went for a spin. All the sudden everything shut down
on me. One of the batteris negative terminal had lodged itself in the little
battery hole & must have shorted something out? I got it jumped & started O.k.
but now the turn signal;s are out of whack & the emergency flashers are out of
whack also. So now where do I begin.
