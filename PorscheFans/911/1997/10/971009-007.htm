Hi all,

I'm new to the list and I am still only a Porsche fan but hopefully
that will change soon.

I took a 84 Carrera over to Height MotorSports in Newport, CA for a
pre-purchase inspection and was treated really nicely.  In fact I
was treated great!  I had a blast talking with the mechanic and roaming
around the place for quite a few hours and inspecting the cars in the
shop and speaking with other clients.  No attitudes here, everyone 
there simply loved Porsches.  Needless to say I found the whole
experience extremely enjoyable.  I am still quite "high" from it.

Unfortunately, the mechanic gave the car a thumbs-down. :(

Simply stated the existing owner's version of the word "pristine" was
a lot different than the mechanic's.  Among the things that I wouldn't
be able to catch (oil leaks, cables, bearings, switches, etc.) he found
dents in the roof, which out of excitement I never saw.

I just wanted to thanks those who advice everyone to take it a mechanic
first.

So in the end, I still don't have a car but soon now.  Real soon now...

Anyone have leads on a guards red coupe (80-85, <$18000) that may be
for sale?

Thanks,
