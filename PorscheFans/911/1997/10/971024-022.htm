I recently finished replacing the fuel pump check valve on my '79 SC and
I thought I'd pass along the experience. It's not quite as easy as I'd
been led to believe, but it's certainly workable. Everybody throws
around the part number for the replacement check valve like it's the
only thing you need, but it's not. On the 77-79 models, the original
check valve is built into the m10 banjo fitting on the fuel line - not
the fuel pump. Unfortunately, all of the check valves in the Porsche
parts bin use a m12 banjo fitting (with a choice of m10 or m12 threads
for the fuel pump end,the 77-79 models use the m12 threads). So, for a
'77-'79, you need the M12x1.5 - M12x1.5 check valve[893 906 093], m12
cap nut[928 110 475 01], and 3 sealing rings[900 123 005 20]. This gets
you everything for the fuel pump, but you still need a new m12 banjo
fitting for the fuel line. The factory method of taking care of this is
replacing the entire fuel line with pn[911 356 066 07] which has the m12
fitting for around $70. I chose a different method. I went to a junk
yard and cut a m12 banjo fitting off of a cis equipped VW (up at the
fuel distributor - verify size of hose barbs). I then cut the old m10
fitting with the check valve off of my car and replaced it with the
new/old m12 banjo and a hose clamp. Total cost was around $30 and fit
and worked perfectly.

I think the '80 and later cis cars already have the m12 banjo, so they
don't need to go through all of this, all they need is the check valve
itself. I think(but don't hold me to this) that the pre '77 cis cars are
in the same boat as the '77-79 models though (check fuel pump threads to
verify which valve you need).

As a sidenote,  pn[911 608 901 00] is a banjo fitting with internal
check valve from the '74 model, but I wasn't able to find out what size
banjo fitting it is. If it is an M10 with the proper size hose barbs, it
may be a simpler fix.

Incidentally, this stopped my fuel pressure from dropping like a rock
after turn off, but my warm start problem remains, so the hunt goes on.
