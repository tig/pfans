Gene Hertel asked about an address for Pertonix.  Gene, you can get this
product from Automotion.  However, I recently had them send me THREE of them, to replace the points in my 1975 911 S Targa, (after being left by the side of the road due in part to contaminated points).  It sounded like a great product, but I found that the included instructions were not written for my application (my car has a Permatune CD box).  I took the car to my local P-wrench, who called Pertonix and supposedly was given specific instructions on how to install it in my car.  Long story -- bottom line  is that I ended up sending all three of the units back to Automotion.  They did give me a refund, but I had to pay my shop for three hours of shop time (one for each attempt at installation of what turned out be defective Pertonix units).  And, I am stuck using my points..
