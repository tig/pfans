I would like to hear from any list members who have replaced the dual mass
flywheels on their  C-2 or C-4s with the single lightweight units available
from the performance market. I have heard stories of unstable idles and
stalling off throttle. Has any one experienced these problems and what was
the cure? Have also heard stories that some of these lightweight single
 flywheels were machined incorrectly and that the sensor pick is in the wrong
place causing some of the problems mentioned above. Could someone shed some
light on this subject.
Thank you
