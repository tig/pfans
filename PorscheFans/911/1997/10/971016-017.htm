Folks,

I have had some limited experience rebuilding my 2.4S motor, 
down to the crank and back.  I do this only under adult supervision,
being allowed, at a certain hourly rate, to work at my mechanic's
shop.  He's a good guy and excellent wrench, so the process hasn't
been too painful.

Hanging around the shop, one of the things I noticed that made him
so good and efficient, is that, for any task on an air-cooled Porsche,
he knew exactly which tools (called, by him, a 'setup', especially if
it involves using more than one tool in combination) were needed.  So
he would get the tools needed, go over to the car and do the procedure.
This is in rather stark contrast to my approach of grabbing a handful
of tools, futzing around and finding that something slightly different was
needed, heading back to the toolbox to get that, etc. etc.

With this in mind, the next to last rebuild (don't ask about the frequency
or reasons, please, I've posted the oil-system story already) I kept a 
fairly exacting log of the steps required for complete disassembly and
reassembly of the motor, ALONG WITH THE EXACT TOOLS NEEDED
FOR EACH TASK.  The last rebuild I verified and tuned this log.

If any of you would be interested, I'll email it to you.  It's currently
in WP5.1 format (don't ask about that either, please), but will be
sent in MS-Word 95 format.  Let me know.
