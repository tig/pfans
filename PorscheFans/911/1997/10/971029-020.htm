This is the worst possible advice.Tyres wear in the centre due to _too much_ 
pressure.If you deliberately over inflate a tyre,and put a straight edge across 
the width of the tread,you will see the tyre has expanded more in the centre 
than near the sidewalls.Reducing pressure will help prevent excess centre tread 
wear.it _may_ however,alter handling in a manner you may not desire.

44 PSI sounds a hell of a lot for any road car tyre,used _on the road_.

The end result may be that given your car and geometry and tyre combination,it 
is just "one of those things" in that you accept uneven wear,or compromise the 
handling traits you desire...
