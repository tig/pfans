 Mark Litherland,  911guy@ideas-inc.org,   Black '79 911SC Coupe,
wonders if he can get his starter out without dropping the engine. 
Answer is yes:  Obviously disconnect battery.  Wires are held to starter
with a 13mm nut and also a push on connector.  Starter is held to tranny
with a 15 or 17mm nut on a 10mm stud.  Starter is held also by one of the
4 bolts which holds the tranny and engine together.  Usually this is a long
10mm allen head bolt (maybe use an 8mm tool?).  Sometimes this is a
stud with a nut.  This is the kind of job where you have to fiddle and
reach and curse a bit and drop dirt into your eyes to pay your dues
(assuming you don't have a lift and can't work in a civilized position like
real mechanics get to do).  Extensions to your sockets will be useful. 
But all in all not a big deal.  

If you are really having trouble, you can gain clearance by putting car on
jack stands, put jack under rear of engine, pull the two rear engine mount
bolts, and lower the engine and tranny as a unit very carefully just a bit
until you see hoses and wires looking like they may soon get taut.  This
will give you more clearance above the tranny (you can usually actually
reach over the tranny anyway).  but you shouldn't need this trick for
what you want to do, so save it for some other operation (like getting at
the oil pressure idiot light sender) when the need arises.

An auto electric shop ought to be able to bench test your starter when
you bring it in your greasy hands to them, plus you can look at its gear
teeth to see if they are messed up badly, and even peer in (maybe with
aid of a mirror) to look at the flywheel ring gear teeth to see if they are
messed up (I'll bet they are just fine because they are tough, which is
good because you do have to pull the engine to get at them).  Starters do
wear out, and my experience with this is usually associated with
everything being hot (as after turning engine off at gas station after
driving long enough to get everything thoroughly warm).  However, read
Paul Margaritis post where his starter problems (symptoms not quite like
yours) were due to an invisible bad connection up at the battery positive
terminal!
