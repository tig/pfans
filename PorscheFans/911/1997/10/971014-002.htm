Hey guys,

....This is my third post about the '87 Carrera that I'm thinking I might buy..
 Sorry for SO MANY posts on the same topic ... please bear with me...  And
again, to everyone who responded to my previous posts, your advice is proving
most valuable!

Anyway, I went for my SECOND test-drive in the Cassis Red coupe last night.
 (Thanks to those of you who told me the official name of the color!)  This
time, I was by myself, without my friend there to keep disrupting me.  I took
30 minutes to go over it with a fine-toothed comb, and another 30 to drive it.

My two concerns before were (1) hard shifting, and (2) pulling to the left on
acceleration.  This time, the shifting felt like I thought it should.  (Again,
my friend wasn't in the passenger seat, jabbering away...)  It still pulled to
the left, but this time I brought my handy-dandy tire guage.  Pressures were:
 30psi on each tire in the front, 36psi right rear, 26psi left rear!  Could the
low pressure in the left rear tire cause the pulling to the left when I hit the
gas?  (Also, what should proper pressures be?  Sizes are 205/55-16 front,
225/50-16 rear.)

This time, I noticed why the car was seemingly underpriced, too.  It's been
wrecked.  It's really an excellent repair job, and I failed to notice it on my
first visit.  (I was kinda disappointed, as much over the fact that it had been
wrecked as I was over the fact that I didn't notice on my first visit!  I take
pride in being able to spot such things....)  Anyway, I noticed the texture or
ripple in the paint inside the fender lip on the left rear didn't quite match
the other fenders.  (You know what I'm talking about - the rippled paint they
use on surfaces that may get beat up my rocks and such.)  It WAS rippled, but
not quite like the others.  The guy selling it 'fessed up to it, and showed me
the welds inside the engine bay where it was repaired as well.

What are you guys' opinion on this?  I've always said I'd NEVER buy one that
had been wrecked.  But, the repair job on this one seems to be perfect!  The
gap between the engine-lid and the repaired fender is as straight and even as
it would've been from the factory!  And the color is a dead-on match.  (There's
absolutely NO difference!)  Plus, it gives me a little more negotiating room in
the price.  ...They guy selling it says he THINKS it was a minor accident, like
somebody had backed into it in a parking lot.

Oh, and looking through the service records, it said, "Replace Clutch/Clutch
Assembly" at 55k miles.  (Currently has 67k miles.)  Cost was like $1600.
 Would that be/include the factory bulletin to replace the release arm and
pivot bearings?

Again, thanks for everyone's help and patience!

Thanks,
David Anderson

BTW:  I've made arrangements (pending my loan approval) to take the car to my
mechanic to have him check it out.  It's a pretty cool situation - my
mechanic's place is about 50 miles away from where the car is being sold, and I
get to do the driving for the inspection!  About 50% interstate / 50% curvy
back roads.  Now THAT'll be a test drive!
