Hi all,

Sorry this is not a go-faster technical question!!  Next after 
go-faster, handle better, stay younger longer, etc.  I need SOUNDS GOOD 
TO ME!

Could do with some advice on radios.  My car has a pretty decent sound 
system in it already, Duh...some kinda Pioneer or whatever, and I'll 
admit I'm not an audiophile at all (so your kids are safe!), but I keep 
thinking BECKER GOOD- need to get one plugged in.  This is sort of 
anectdotal, since I can't really remember what kind I've had in earlier 
cars- probably Blaupunkt, but didn't really even think about it..  Now 
I'm thinking of saving up for the B-thing, and am looking for 
recommendations on era-correct models (where you get?) as well as 
opinions on new ones that will fit snugly in my older P-car without a 
big hassle.  I've scoped out the prices for new base models ($390 odd) 
and that's OK I spose, but I would prefer a re-furb'd 'correct' one.  
Next-  I'll probably switch out the speakers at the same time- (got 4 in 
right now) and dunno what gives with them either but know Becker have 
complimentary sets that look as though they serve little noise to BIG 
NOISE!!  Classic!!

Could probably do with some thoughts on amps as well, but don't think I 
really need extra volume that much.  I'm hoping that there's a well of 
used radios/amps/speakers from sadly crashed P-cars (although this does 
seem mawkish- better in my dash than dead on a shelf!!)  But new would 
be OK too if advice is that old = not useful.

Finally, (sorry 'bout all this guff) what's the deal with the SW 
(shortwave) freq's on Beckers?  Who uses this?  Does someone really 
listen into Radio Hanoi/BBC World Service/VOA-Liberty in their P-car?!!!  
Does it sound decent, reception of SW being a bugger just about 
everywhere?

Have no idea what came as option/standard on the '75-76 year models.  
Need to get smart.

Appreciate any info- as always.

charming stay in Novorossiysk. (You really ought to try it.)
