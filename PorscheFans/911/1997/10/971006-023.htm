Christian:

I bought my 1983 SC in May 1994 and have used it as my "daily driver" 
(barring snow, hail, and heavy rain) since.  The odometer showed 38,000 at 
purchase and now shows 65,000.

I purchased it from a Lexus dealer (to whom it was wholesaled from a 
Mercedes dealer) after a pre-purchase inspection (absolutely necessary) and 
subsequent price reduction due to the work required to rectify some 
deficiencies.  An aside: The day I picked-up the car from the Lexus dealer, 
a couple in their late 40s were in the same area picking-up their new 
Lexus.  The gentleman was listening intently to the salesman, but the lady 
was transfixed staring at my 911.

My mechanic performed the following work;
- installed Carrera chain tensioners,
- installed pop-off valve,
- replaced clutch, resurfaced flywheel, replaced reverse gear,
- replaced alternator, and
- replaced the muffler.

My total investment in both the purchase price and repairs/improvements was 
$18,500.

Since then, I have replaced the tires, had the requisite oil changes and 
valve adjustments performed, had the front wheel bearings replaced, and the 
front brake calipers rebuilt.  I also had a short-shift kit installed and 
replaced the radio and speakers.

I love this car!  Each time I climb in, it brings a smile to my face.  It 
is utterly reliable, only quitting once when the fuel pump fuse corroded.

My situation makes owning this car reasonably practical.  I only live (2) 
miles from work so I don't accrue many miles commuting.  My wife works 
where I do, so we ride in her car when the weather is inclement.  We don't 
have children, so space is not an issue.

That said, I can't imagine spending $20,000 and up for the basic 
transportation that others drive when I can drive the car I have coveted 
since my teen years.

Good Luck,
Steve
