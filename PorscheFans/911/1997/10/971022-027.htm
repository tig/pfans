I previously owned (2) 1986 951's with Authority Stage 2 and cat pipe.
Conservatively about a 60hp upgrade. Both vehicles were street driven only.
Full-throttle hard-driving on highways is easier said that done. I'm sure
that the track is a different world. Rarely exceeded 135mph. Extremely
little time spent at red-line. Regularly exceeded 120mph. I drove one of
them for a year in stock mode. The "seat-of-the pants" sensation of the
upgrade was not that significant. It was on par with the typical difference
you find between different examples of the same car. The biggest change was
that the boost came on without as much throttle, which helped city
driveability.

Granted that those were turbo cars, but my feeling is if that was my
experience with a 30% hp increase, then a 10% hp jump in the C2 will be
imperceptible. So why bother for a chance of additional wear. Opinions?



>Well, if you consider broken rings and melted pistons as "damage" rather

ignition and fuel flow that >Mr. Buxton mentions does two things: 1)

lunch.
