I have been considering a chip for the 911 due to the (my perception)
poor part throttle response and power in the 2-4K range. I have a chip
(plus exhaust and MAF) in the SHO, and I gained top end HP, but the most
pleasant gain was in the around-town driveability. I'm probably spoiled
to the responsiveness of that engine, but the 911 feels pretty soft by
comparison. If a chip can sharpen the throttle response, I don't care
what the claims are for top-end HP.

What matters is the torque curve. If the chip adds torque above 5K to
give a 10% HP increase it's not worth it, but a 10% torque increase
across the usable rpm range (2-6K) would be well worth it.
