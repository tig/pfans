I've recently had the unthinkable happen to my '91 C4. I CRACKED it up!!
 After being sick the entire weekend following "the incident" I had one thing
on my mind, how was I going to do the necessary repairs and would it ever be
the same? Body damage was contained to the front left bumper/hood/fender. The
front axle was untouched, I didn't even break a headlight.

After finding a very reputable body shop, I contacted my Insurance agency
(AAA) so the adjuster could inspect the vehicle at the body shop. 

My problem is that the adjuster/insurance company is insisting on "Quality
Recycled parts" for the fender and hood and bumper as well as some other
parts such as bumper seals,lamps etc. They feel this won't compromise the
repair and don't want to spend money on new factory parts.  

Does anybody have any insight they can offer on what to watch out for. The
body shop also suggested that the entire care may have to be repainted due to
body stress that created a slight crack in several areas, with exception of
the engine lid/fin and rear bumper .  Will sandblasting hurt the rustproofing
done at the factory, or is it better than painting over the existing paint?  

I have alot of confidence in the body shop I've selected, but would
appreciate any confirmation from those of you who live,eat,and breath
Porsche!

Thanks
Not sleeping well lately,
'91 C4 - Forest Green
