Hi,

I posted yesterday about the '71 911E that I was to go test drive last night.
....When I finally got to see the car up close, it wasn't quite what I expected.

The car has been completely redone, by the shop at the dealer who was selling
it.  And this time, I didn't even talk to a salesman - I dealt directly with
the mechanic who did the restoration.  (By the way - the car comes with a
warranty on all the EXTENSIVE work they did!)

At first glance, the car was great!  The paint appeared to be original (on all
but the front left fender), but looked really good, especially for 26-year-old
paint!  (I suppose it could've been painted in the past, but if it was, it was
a perfect job.)  The inside looked great, too, except for a few minor cosmetic
flaws (broken window crank, map pockets coming loose from doors).  Oh, and the
odometer had broken at 93k miles.  (Or 193k miles?...)  ...They had recarpeted
the entire interior, and the mechanic kept stressing to me that the carpet was
German...

A quick check in the engine bay left me a little confused.  The VIN showed the
car to be a '70 (built in November, so I guess it could've been sold as a '71).
 But the engine number began "614...".  (I didn't have my little 911 book by
Zimmerman with me at the time, so I had to remember the number.)  Plus, the
engine didn't look at all like the mechanical fuel-injected engines that I had
seen before.  (But, I'm not really familiar with the early cars...)  The
mechanic explained to me that the engine was a 2.7 from a '77 (he *thought*).
 He talked about how the car would FLY.  So we drove it...

It was quick!  But not as quick as he made it seem.  Also, the throttle seemed
really sensitive - like it was an on/off switch!  You're either coasting, or
pinned to your seat!  ...Anyway, after the test drive, he put it up on the
hoist for me to see underneath.  NICE!  The engine and trans had been
completely rebuilt.  EVERYTHING below looked brand new!  New shocks, sway bar,
steering rack, brake master cylinder, stainless brake lines, rotors, calipers,
pads, CV joints and boots, all the suspension bushings...  It looked like a new
car underneath.  Still, I was a bit dismayed about the engine transplant.

After I left, I got Zimmerman's book, and looked up the engine numbers.
 "614..."  That's the number from a '74 2.7 from a 911 (NOT S and NOT
Carrera!).  So, basically, they swapped for a more "modern" engine with similar
power.  Plus, with the stories I've heard about the 2.7's, I had to say NO.  I
can appreciate performance mods when done right, but I'm also one to appreciate
originality.  In this case, what I wanted was an original 911E.

Anyway, just wanted to share my story!

David
