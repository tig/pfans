Hmmm… ofcourse I don't know exactly what happened or what the car looks
like, but this sounds pretty serious to me, 'body stress' that makes the
paint crack all over the car? I hate to make you feel worse, but this might
indicate that the entire car is twisted (I guess body stress is a too nice
way to put it) or the paint-shop is screwing with your head trying you to
get the entire car repainted...
Did the paintshop check you car on a bench/rigg? This is the ONLY way to
check if the car is still strait, have it done! Same for the suspension
(all four axles!). They might seem ok, but again this is not something you
can check just by looking at it!
My advice is to take your car to an off.P-dealer, let them examine your car
and make up a damage report (what's damaged, costs for labour & parts to
fix it etc.etc.). Rub this under the insurance guy's nose and make sure he
pays (insurance companies have a tendency to screw you for a couple of
bucks and leave you with a lousy car that's undriveable and unsellable).
Now take this money and go to a decent paint/body shop to have the car
fixed (for usually less than at the dealer). Spend the rest of the money on
something nice…
So make sure you don't get ripped of by the insurance company or the
paintshop!

Sorry can't help you on this

Hope I helped, make sure everything is checked and fixed properly or you'll
end up with a no good car, ask around at different bodyshops (go see how
they work).
I know how you are feeling right now… (Someone hit my car the first month I
had it).

Lots of luck!
