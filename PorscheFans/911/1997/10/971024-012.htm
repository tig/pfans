Yes, that's normal. It's a pressurized system, of course, and removing 
the fill cap will result in an RPM drop and rough idle, usually.

Before I bought my SC I took it to a local dealer for a pre-purchase 
inspection. They gave it two thumbs up and I bought the car the same day. 
It seemed, however, that it was idling much less smoothly than it had 
been when I first test drove it. A few days later I discovered that the 
oil fill cap was not in place! I frantically looked all over, and found 
it wedged elsewhere in the engine compartment. Nice. Putting it back 
where it belonged restored the throaty purr I'd remembered.
