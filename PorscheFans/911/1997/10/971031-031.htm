>My problem is that the adjuster/insurance company is insisting on
"Quality
Recycled parts" for the fender and hood and bumper as well as some other
parts such as bumper seals,lamps etc. They feel this won't compromise
the
repair and don't want to spend money on new factory parts.

There was some media going on a few years ago regarding recycled
parts/or other than "oem".  Basically stating that using other than oem
parts my have problems, fit, thickness etc.

You can demand that only oem parts should be used on your car for the
above reasons (if you are forcefull with this, they should/will back
down).  Remember, ALL insurance companies will want to repair your car
for the least amount of money possible, this is how they can make their
undewriting profits.  Is this what you are paying your premiums for??

OTOH, the parts may be great - but that is the unknown....

PS. about sandblasting, I'd stay away from that. this creates much heat
and can warp panels, a media blast with plastic media, walnut shells
etc. operates at much lower temps so less risk of damaging panels
