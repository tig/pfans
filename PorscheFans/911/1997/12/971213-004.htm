Hi P-Fans,

All of my vehicles have the H-4's.  The 911 has the 80/100's (the first set
I bought) and the others have 55/100's.  If the aim is off, you will get
flashed by oncoming traffic, but generally not.  The 911 has had these
lights for 4 years with no wiring problems and no relay.  The only caveat I
have is that vehicle inspections here in NC require that the aim be checked.
You have to find an inspection station with the rolling floor type
adjustment device or install the old headlamps to pass inspection.
