Combating a fast idle problem by changing the timing from factory
specs sounds like something is wrong with your former mechanic.  This
sounds like a aux air regulator or aux air valve problem (if it idles OK
when cold, but idles way too high when warm...).  But anyway, I wouldn't
mess with the mixture unless you have access to a machine that
measures %CO.  I would be tempted to bring the car back to factory
timing (and mixture if necessary) specs and then see what's going on.
It sounds like something is amiss, but your former mechanic was just
trying to attach the symptoms, not the problem...  (of course, I'm spec-
ulating here...)

Good luck,
