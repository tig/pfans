Fred asked about a brake resevoir cap for pressure bleeding.  I made mine
from the cap from a large jar of TUMMS.  Used the valve stem from an old
bike tube, carefully trimmed the tube to fit the inside diameter of the
cap.  Drill a hole in the cap, slip the valve stem through from the inside,
and you've got a rubber seal against the resevoir mouth.  Hank's recommendation
of a tooltruck part would surely be better, but...

Andy asked about a "tuning fork" sound from the front boot as he released
his brakes.  Not sure exactly how the booster system works, but I've measured
the vacuum and it drops quickly when you apply the brakes, then rebuilds
slowly when brakes are released.  The sound could be from air being drawn
out of the booster through its vacuum port.  Mine apparently has some fluid
inside, and for a while made a little gurgle noise.  Anyone know an easy
way to drain the booster, short of removing it completely?

Andrew mentioned a Jackie Stewart quote about learning to master brakes last.
As I read his monolog, a suprising remark by Hurley Haywood at our GGR
Famous Drivers banquet came to mind.  Hurley said that in pro racing, there
is no "driving line".  The line is merely the one you happen to be on as you
pass through the corner, which varies from lap to lap as traffic and conditions
change.  While Andrew's comments about timing and brake points may be
appropriate for Time Trial drivers, I think Hurley opened my eyes a bit to
the greater challenges of professional driving, where Jackie certainly
flourished.

FWIW
