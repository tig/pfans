Well here it is winter, so I am beginning my interior restoration on my 70
91T
Mechanically it is in really good shape,rebuilt engine etc. But the floor
pans leave
 a little bit to be desired.There are a few  wholes in them, but not like
your going to fall through or anything. well I noticed all of this when I
removed the carpet. What is the best way to repair them. Do you patch them or
replace them (wow that seems like a hell of a lot of work). Also there was a
wood template looking thing under the clutch, brake & throttle. I removed it
in a rather rough way. Is that the way they came or did the PO rig that up.
As you guys can tell this is my first porsche.
Also on top of the floor pans there is this dried rubber stuff this is
breaking & flaking off. What is that stuff. It seems to be some kind of
undercoating or something.
Any way I need to get this takemn care of & put new carpet down. Oh yeah
where is the best place to get replacement carpet. 

TIA
