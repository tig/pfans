Hi,
I'm researching an article on Porsche 900-series numbers that are
neither road cars 9911,912,914, etc) nor race cars (935, etc). My
understanding is that a 900-series number is either the term for a car
(road or race) and/or the designation for an internal Porsche
engineering project which may result either a car or a refresh of an
existing car as seen with new part numbers.

Thus the 911 has part numbers beginning 901, 930, 964, 993 and, latterly
996.

I assume Porsche used project numbers in sequence such that the 964
project was started before the 996 project.

If anyone knows of a source text or person for these numbers could they
let me know please?

I'm particularly interested in things like 94-series numbers and
97-series numbers.

I'd like comment on the notions that :-

924 part numbers begin 924-?
The 924 was the 2nd cheap 911 model after the 914 and had 4 cyclinders
hence the 924?
The 928 had a V8 engine hence 928?
The 944 was a more powerful 4-cylinder engine hence 944?
The 968 should have been called the 964 (= more powerful 944 with 4-cyl
engine but the 964 iteration of the 911 got to that number first hence
the 968 term? This could of course be pure baloney.
What do part numbers for the 968 commence with?

Please contact me at the trainspotters anorak meeting or by email!

Regards ... Chris.
