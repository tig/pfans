Quick rehash:  '79 911 SC, symptoms: runs for 1-2 minutes and dies.
While running it is smooth.  Testing so far:  Fuel pressure starts out
around 1 bar and raises to around 2 bar before dying.  Ignition timing
has been played with and it seems to run a bit better while advanced
(0-15 degrees after TDC).
    The glowing middle engine compartment fuse was solved by unplugging
the fan.  Removing all fuses and relays did not have any noticable
effect.  Unplugging the fan kept the fuse from blowing, but did not
otherwise help any.
    Questions:
    1.  Could my fuel/air mixture be really far off and causing this?
    2.  Could it be a crack somewhere it my airbox?  I had some
backfiring, but the airbox/rubber boot seem ok from what I can see/feel.

    Options as I see them:
    1.  Take it to Bosch and have them fix it.  I'm at the only
independent shop in the area (not many over here in Germany, most people
just go to the dealer) and he's out of ideas.  I'm not eager to do this
since he just showed me a bill he'd just gotten from them for about $500
to do 2 hours of diagnostic work on a 944, and that was with him
supplying his own parts, I'd be buying theirs, which are even more
expensive then they are from the dealer in the states).
    2.  Buy a rebuilt CD ignition and swap it with my MSD unit that I
put in when my CD unit blew about a year ago.  This would eliminate the
possibility of a problem with my ignition and would be a necessary
precurser to taking it to Bosch (they freaked when I took it to them
without a Bosch ignition in it and told me the MSD was the problem,
pointing to the scope and saying the spark wasn't powerful enough).
    3.  Replace the whole CIS system.  I can probably do this for
cheaper then taking it to Bosch by buying a used one, probably cost me
around $500.
    I think I'll also lift the car and check valve clearances as a way
of checking cam timing.  I know most people told me this isn't the
problem, but I'm reaching now anyway.
