Hi Kevin.  I've been looking at buying the manuals also.  From what I
understand for my car (86 Targa) I would need to buy the 1965-71 (2 vol),
1972-83 (3 vol), and the 1984-89 (5 vol).  My dealer said the newer manuals
(like the 84-89) are just supplements for the olders manuals, only containing
information that has been updated between the years, so I would have to buy
all 10 volumes.  I notice the Automotion catalog (they are very expensive in
there) has a pretty good description of what volumes you need for a "complete
set" for any particular year.
