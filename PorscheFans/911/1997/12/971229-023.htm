Thanks. I tested my battery and sure enough it is charged so I'm ready to
go.

My battery came with the appropriate mounting bracket. Fits great except the
ground wire is too short to fit to the negative terminal on the Optima. I'm
on my way down to an auto supply store to buy a longer (-) wire. Hopefully
I'll be able to find something that will work 'cause I already have the old
battery out of the car. Looks like the PO replaced the factory battery with
a gigantic battery that is so big the existing mounting hardware did not
fit. The thing was not even bolted down (but it couldn't move around very
much 'cause it was so big). 

Thanks again.

	For Charlie Kindel:
	The battery I got for my SC came charged. Also, AJ-USA in San Diego
	makes a neat installation bracket that eliminates the need to drill
any
	additional holes. It is essentially a piece of aluminum plate,
slightly
	longer than the battery. It bolts to the bottom of the battery, and
in
	turn is held down by the stock battery retention clamp.
