Hi everyone,
   I am new to the list and I am interested in purchasing a 911, but I 
have some questions to bounce off the all the experienced members of the 
porsche list.
   I am currently interested in buying a '89 C4 or 90/91 C2/C4, both 
coupes.  I haven't found the right car yet, but I'm very patient and I 
have a one to two year time frame for purchase anyway.  After purchase, 
I would like to convert the 3.6L coupe to a turbo model.  Ofcourse, 
modifications to the intake, exhaust, and cpu will be performed as well 
along with other non-turbo related components like the suspension, 
brakes, wheels, and tires.
   My questions are:

   What is the avg. maintenance cost (tune-ups, oil changes, etc...) for 
a good condition 3.6L 89-91 911 coupe?
   Are there any common problems I have to look for in regards to the 
3.6L 89-91 coupes?  Engine, body, interior, etc...
   The turbo conversion will be done professionally, but are there still 
any known problems or areas to be concerned about during and/or after 
the conversion?
   Finally, if there are any list members out there who have performed a 
turbo conversion on their 3.6L 911, I would greatly appreciate it if you 
could share with me your experiences with the conversion and how the car 
runs after the conversion.  Specific modifcations, performance, 
maintenance, reliability, etc...

Thanks in advance for everyones time and efforts,
Hung Nguyen
