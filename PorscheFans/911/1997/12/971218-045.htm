Dennis - 

Your finger must have slipped a digit on the keyboard:  These are 10mm
X 1.0 threads.  Which is mighty fine for a 10mm, but I found them in a well
equipped local hardware store, and at an Eagle hardware store too. 
You can just bolt them it, though I too cut off hex heads and sawed a
screwdriver slot into each one.  On my race car mine occasionally fall
out, though.  I use Loctite 504 or whatever that orange case sealer stuff
is, but it is not perfect.  I suppose with some thought I could figure out a
way of safety wiring them.

Automotion used to sell a socket headed set screw of this size, which
should allow you to screw it in a lot tighter and with less fuss.  They quit
because (per the voice on the phone) the EPA got after them.  So
somewhere in this world there is a supplier of a better device.  If anyone
knows just where, let us know.
