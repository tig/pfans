><aloha,,,anyone have info about the 24 hrs. le mans????  
I attended last year and can give you some tips.

Foremost, if you don't have a room, move soon. The LeMans Tourist Board can
set you up with a family in the city. We were less than 1/2 mile from the
entrance. It is very reasonable too! We enjoyed our stay with a local
family as much as the race itself (and we spoke no French, and they no
english). The Tourist Board phone number is 43.28.17.22 (FAX 43.23.37.19)
If you FAX them your requirements including date of arrival and departure
and any other needs they will set you up. Unfortunately they don't respond
unitl May. Last years charge was FF 225 for a double bed and FF 5 each for
breakfast per day.

The official web site is at
www.24h-le-mans.com

Be sure you visit Dave Davies great site "Club Arnage" at
www.cix.co.uk/~davies/index.htm

General admission tickets (Encientes Generales) were FF 320 last year.
Grandstand tickets range from FF 200-500. I didn't see '98 ticket prices on
the official site but they will probably have all the forms available soon.
With the French exchange rate near 5.75, it's a bargain!

There are many other race related events inthe days before the race you can
enjoy. The open pit area on Saturday and the international pagentry in the
hours before the race are both exciting.

If you are flying from the states, you can take the French train (SNCF)
directly to LeMans without going through Paris (but don't skip Paris!) It's
about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Make sure you bring an FM radio to listen to
the all English speaking "Radio LeMans."

I can give you additional information. e-mail me directly. 

GO FOR IT!

Sincerely,

Dave Christiano   -   Springfield, Missouri
