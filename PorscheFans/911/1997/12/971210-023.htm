Hi Bryan:

On your '73  2.7, you would not have the fuel rail's I mentioned in my
earlier response (these are for later F/I..).
Your 2.7 used (I think) in '73 the K-Jetronic fuel injection system.
Here's what you do to remove the K-Jet injectors:

- Unscrew the fuel line nut from the top of the injector

- The injector can then be pulled from the mounting hole - as I
remember, the way I did that was to place a large nut over the end of
the injector (the size of the nut that held the fuel line in place) and
screw it on so that it fully engaged the threads of the injector. I
*carefully* used a small brass pry bar (against the nut you just put) on
to pry the injector straight out. It will come, but work carefully. I've
think I've seen a special tool for this somewhere, but never used one.

- Anyway, there is a rubber O-ring - either still attached to the
injector or still in the injector sleeve - you should probably replace
these if they haven't been yet.

- Also, as I recall, you need to bleed the system if you take out an
injector or put in the cold start valve...  Let me know if you want
directions for doing that....

Best,
