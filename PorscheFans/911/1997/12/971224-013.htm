I have a 1973 911T.  I have purchased a set of new SS heat exchangers (HE)
to replace the original (rusted) steel ones.  I would like some advise from
any of you concerning the removal of the original HE.

You can get the HXs off just as well with the engine in the car.  I would
jack the rear high enough to get some room, and, of course, put a set of
sturdy jack stands in place for safety.

Definitely start with a lot of penetrating oil - a day in advance if
possible.  Heat helps, but it beats me how you are going to get a torch up
there without setting oil, gasoline, or rubber parts on fire.  Perhaps
running the engine briefly would help, but then you will burn your hands. 
Tap each stud gently with a hammer and punch to try to break up the rust
bonds.  I have done the job cold several times, and broken studs only once.

Once you have done all the preparations, you need the courage to turn the
nuts, and pray they loosen rather than break.  Breaking a stud is not the
end of the world, only a little extra work.  You can fix it with the engine
in the car.  However, get the right tools, and do the job professionally. 
The biggest mistake is to try to get the broken stud out using an
"easy-out".  It is anything but easy, and when you break it off, you will
not be able to drill out the hardened steel part stuck in your cylinder
head.  Time to remove the engine and get the head to a machine shop. 
Letting the drill bit wander off-center is also a bad mistake.  The drill
will steer itself towards the softer material, and may break off.  This
will also require engine removal and a trip to the machine shop.

The steel stud can be drilled out using a hand drill.  You must use steel
guide bolted to the remaining stud.  The guide is needed to keep the drill
centered in the broken stud.  A very sharp left-hand drill bit (cutting
direction reversed) is used.  A left-handed drill cuts with the drill in
reverse, so the loose bits of the stud thread themselves out as the cutting
is done.

Install a HeliCoil per their instructions.  Install your new stud,
(Property Class 12.8 required), and you are back in business.  A broken
stud costs an hour of extra work, plus the time to gather the tools and
parts.  If the job is botched, you will need to remove the engine, and
possibly need a new cylinder head.  I wish I knew a bullet-proof way to get
the nuts off.  I think in some cases the stud is too rusted.  There is no
choice but to break it.

Good luck.  Let us know how it goes.
