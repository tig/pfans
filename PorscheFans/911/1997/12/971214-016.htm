---------------------------------

I was able to get two Turbo front fenders  straightened and mounted on my
Carrera convertible, rear Turbo Flares butt welded on, C2 conversion nose,
tail and rockers fitted, and the entire care painted with Glasurit for
$7,000. The result is pictured in the Automotion catalog.

The only reason I got it done so cheap in the high labor environment of El
Lay is that I made the deal for cash and let the (very good) body shop take
8 months to do it.

The paint alone would have been under $3500 under the same circumstances.
