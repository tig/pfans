Permit me to add my $.02 worth on this: I bought a '68 911 about 18 months ago
which had just been totally rebuilt (my main reason for buying). The PO, or his
mechanic had placed a plug in the oil return, and neglected to remove it before
hooking everything back up. This as a tiny plastic plug, about the size of my
little finger tip. It held in place for two or three weeks with no noticeable
effects; no overheating, nothing. (I had not driven the car hard, just to and from
work). One day on the way home I heard a "foomp" and the idiot light went on. I
stopped immediately and had the car towed to Ron Appleton's shop. For only $4,100 I
got the $.01 plug removed from my oil pump. No damage to the pump, bearings, or
anything else. Okay, so all the $4,100 wasn't to remove the plug--I had new cams
installed, the crankshaft retrued, and some other minor stuff done. Still, it was
an expensive lesson.

So, if you use plugs, my advice is to use ones that fit OVER, not inside anything,
or trust that you have perfect enough memory to remove any you placed inside any
orifices. Oil pumps choke on anything but oil.
