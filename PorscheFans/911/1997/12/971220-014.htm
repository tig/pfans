hello everyone,


   I was just wondering if a oil tank from a 1973 or newer 911 will fit
in a 1972 T. If so will it attache to the stock mounting strap and will 
the oil filler tube and filter match up with the hole used for the stock
oil filter on the inner fender?  Thanks for any help someone may be able
to offer!

Second time in so many weeks that I've been winmail.dat'd and had to go to the
archives in order to read the list--what caused and how do we stop this?

My real posting:
My '78 SC fuel pump had been noisy for sometime so one day when my car bucked
its way home I knew what the cause was going to be.  I replaced the pump and
in case any of the pump internals made their way down stream decided to
replace the fuel filter as well.  When I disected the filter I found the paper
had lots of orangish-rust colored debris.  Fearing the worst I checked further
down stream and was relieved to find my fuel injectors flowing well. 
Several weeks after the replacements my fuel pump started getting noisy again;
this time I drained the fuel tank via the large hex head drain plug.  When I
ran my finger up and inside the tank I discovered the orange goo--looks almost
like copper gasket sealant.
My local independant has this once before with a turbo that kept consuming CIS
components.  Does anyone know what the goo is??  Also has anyone had luck
getting the fuel tank cleaned ?? A new tank sells for almost a thousand bucks
and under the circumstances I am reluctant to buy a used fuel tank.
Any help greatly appreciated, 
                               Tony Z
