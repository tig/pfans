I wouldn't suspect the torsion bar (if there was anything "wrong" with
it - you'd have bigger problems than the car pulling).  I also wouldn't
suspect the shock.

What side of the road do you guys drive on?  The left?  My car pulls
to the right alot of the time, but it is because of the "crown" in the
road.  Could this be part of the problem?  If not, could you have a
left front brake dragging?  Maybe a really screwed up corner balance
situation?

Look for the obvious things first (tire pressures, loose suspension
components, etc.) and then if all else fails, give up.  :>))  Just kidding...

Good luck,

I haven't been following this issue very closely but just remembered that my
1992 C2 had a recall for possible engine compartment fires caused by a faulty
relay controlling the same blower.  I assume 1991's would have the same
problem.  You might check with your local Porsche dealer.
