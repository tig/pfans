The rev limiter is incorporated in the rotor.  If you look at it,
you will see how the centrifical force acts upon it.  The easiest way to
see if it is causing your problem is to put another rotor in.  I carry
an old rotor just in case.
   A couple days ago someone wrote about cleaning the gas tank in an
older car.  My '73 911 tank had an incredible amount of scale and
sediment, at least a quart.  I took it to a local shop where they heat
cleaned it.  Even though they were careful not to overheat the tank in
order to preserve the outer coating, they did destroy some
plastic-looking internal baffles.  The interior of the tank was then
coated with some stuff they were real proud of and with which they had
had good experience.  My injectors no longer miss at low revs, and the
fuel filter does not load up.  I do need more than 1/4 tank of gas at
the track because the tank baffles are missing.
