Mark, 

While I have clipped the content of your message, I want to put out my
overall response to the rest of the list.    

You have one of these all to common mechanics who has chosen to 
work around a CIS problem rather than fix it.   This is OFTEN done, by
misadjusting one component to make up for another which is failing, or
to deal with a symptom of unknown (to him) origin.   Sooner or later,
you simply can't get the car to run right any more, and have a real war
with ignition, mixture, idle, and God knows what fighting with each other.

To do it right, you have to have (and use) a CIS gauge, a command of how
this simple system works, and the common sense to use it.   

Dave
