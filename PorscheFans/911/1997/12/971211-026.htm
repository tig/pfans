Someone asked where to go to get a gas heater for his street car with
racing headers. 

If I felt the need to add a gas heater I would call Joe Boerio at
303-660-9032, or write him at 2162 Vinyard, Castle Rock CO 80104.  Joe
rebuilds gas heaters for cars, sells rebuilt units he has in stock, and will
install also.  At least as of 2 years ago he advertised in Dune Buggies
and Hot VWs.  He has a fax, but I don't know the number.  

Webasto (a brand name) gas heaters were an option in 911s,  the guts
of which I think went into the trap door compartment on the passenger
side of the trunk to the rear of the gas tank.  There are or were other
brands (including South Bend, a US company) used in other cars.  The
Nordsterners probably know a lot about this (unless they all put their
Porsches away for the winter to escape all that rock salt). 

Gas heaters involve injecting pressurized gasoline into a combustion
chamber where a spark from a spark plug ignites it, extracting the heat
by blowing cold air with a fan through a heat exchanger in the
combustion chamber, with the now warm air being blown into the
passenger compartment, and exhausting the now colder combustion air
and its gasses you don't want to breath outside of the car (this latter part
being something Joe said he was particularly careful about.  This is
virtually instant heat, and quite a bit of it.  Very useful in, say, an old VW
van (my only warm my hands in front of it personal experience), so I
suppose it works very well in a 911 also.  The Porsche shop manual
devotes some space to this I think.

If you call Joe say hi for me.  We went racing in the Carrera
Panamericana in 1991.  He's a character.

 I notice a good post on electric heat.  I wonder if that alone would be
enough in a really cold climate?  Should be possible to calculate the heat
loss at 0 F at 60 mph from a 70 F passenger compartment, convert that
to watts, and compare that to the advertised output of these electric
heaters (or calculate output from measured current draw).  VW beetle
and van owners have to resort to a lot of tricks for heat.  Some schemes
involved relocating the oil cooler into the passenger compartment!  One
needn't go that far with a 911, thankfully.
