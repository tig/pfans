Thanks to all the 911 P-Fans that replied about my concern for boost on a
930.  I receive a range of
acceptable boost levels  from 1.1 bar to 1.5 bar, all recommending some
engine upgrades to prevent premature
detonation (like better exhaust and intercooler). While I can believe that
running this level of boost
is OK when "merging" with traffic on the interstate or infrequent blasts to
relevant speed limits (of coarse), but
what about autocross or driver education events?  The local PCA drivers ed
event is on a 3.5 mile coarse and most
of the time, the turbo is ON.  I still have a factory oil temp gauge (that
is something to be corrected in 1998)
so it is hard to tell the oil temp under these conditions.  The factory
gauge has never approached the red area,
or even traveled half the range of the gauge.  Are oil temps a good guide
for protecting cylinders from
meltdown? I would like to wait for an engine rebuild after getting into the
low to mid 100,000 mile range
(currently at 52,000 miles).

On another note, I apologize for the poorly formatted notes that I have
sent.  When I compose them with
my e-mailer, they look to fit the screen.  When they appear in the digest,
they look like I haven't found the
enter key on the keyboard and subscribers are left scrolling to the right on
to infinity.  Other than explicitly
inserting the CR (like this message) what else should be configured on my
e-mailer (Netscape 4.04)?

Thanks,
Randy Fiscus

OK, folks, I'm looking for some reasonably-prices factory seat belts
for my 993.  Don't care about comsetics; don't care about belt condition;
all I want is the flat belt-end "tongue" that the lap/shoulder belt fits thru
and that clips into the inboard seat-mounted belt buckle.  Front or rear
tongue OK; don't care.

I know that the 993 belts fit; not sure about earlier cars.  Dimensions
on my belt tongue are:

Outside:  1" wide X approx. 1 1/8" long straight section
Center cutout:  1/2" wide X approx. 1 1/8" long

Let me know what you might want to sell for less than $50.
