Back before I started doing all the heavy work myself, a shop I used left
the tranny in when the engine needed removal.  Careful inquiry revealed
that the flat rate for some work, like replacing a clutch for instance, or
any work at all just on the engine when it has to come out, includes
removing and replacing the engine and transmission as a unit, as
specified by Porsche in its shop manuals.  So this allowed the mechanic
to beat the flat rate.  

Removing only the engine saves quite a bit of time:  you don't have to
unbolt the CVs and the sway bar (the big tickets), nor undo the speedo
connection, grounding strap, and two tranny mount bolts.  Less fiddling
with clutch cable, too.  Plus you don't have to mess with these things
after engine is back in, so you save twice.  And you have a bit less
weight and length to roll around.  And you are spared the temptation to
clean the last little bit of greasy crud off of the transmission which is
sitting on your garage floor.  

Unbolting the tranny from the engine in the car is not a big deal.  The
bottom two nuts are right there.  For the top two (sometimes at least one
of these is a bolt, sometimes one of the nuts is a barrel nut with an
in-hex, it seems to vary), a little ingenuity, some extensions, and faith in
your jack stands when you have an arm up over the tranny will see you
through. The engine balances on the oil sump plate (or where it would be
on newer cars without one, I suppose). 

You do have to be sure to remember to pull the shift coupler off the
tranny shift rod inside the car, since that shift rod is going to assume an
unnatural angle even though the tranny isn't coming out.  I've been
removing the clutch actuating arm so it doesn't rotate and interfere with
the engine case, although I am not sure this is necessary, especially on
the way out.  You have to remember to remove the back up light
connection from the tranny, and the alternator and starter relay
connections at the starter.

You can't pull the engine back far enough to get the studs to clear the
tranny just pulling straight back on the engine, as it will hit the rear
crossmember before you are free.  So you pull back, lower, pull back
some more, repeat until the alternator is under the cross member and it is
free. 

The dirty truth is you can get away with letting the tranny just hang there
on its rubber mounts if the car isn't going to be moved.  I have frequently
seen 911s up on the lift in shops this way.  But propping it up into
something like its normal position seems the workmanlike thing to do, and
will ease the extra strain on the rubber tranny mounts, especially as it is
liable to sit in your garage that way for some weeks.  

These rubber mounts, by the way, are the key to letting the tranny droop
as is needed for this procedure, so with a race car with solid mounts
you can't get the engine out this way without other gyrations, like pulling
the tranny mount bolts and letting the tranny rest on the sway bar, or
reengineering the rear of your car so you can remove the interfering
crossmember and just pull straight back.

If you intend to move the car with tranny in but engine out, it is simple
enough to run a chain or rope or whatever around the tranny and up
over the crossmember right above the tranny and cinch it up to support
that end of the tranny.  There is a fabric covered foam rubber piece
poked in between this crossmember and the rear seat sheet metal, but
you can remove it or get your rope past it.

Yes, mating the engine back with the tranny is harder with it still in the
car, because of the clutch.  My only experience is with 915s.  I line up
the throwout bearing fork with the bearing as best I can, wiggle things
into position, and check frequently how things feel.  You can also use a
flashlight and a mirror and check through the inspection hole to see if the
forks are sliding  into their slot.  Having another person to push and pull
on the engine at this juncture is very helpful.  Yes, I have thought I got
the TOB hooked up by feel and skipping the mirror trick, only to discover
when I stepped on the clutch to be sure that I hadn't.  No, I wasn't
pleasant company for a microsecond or two, but it is possible to recover
from such flotches.  Yes, you have to have faith in your jack at this point
(although you are under the tranny, not the engine), but you can work up
a good worry when under the tranny in a tranny/engine unit replacement
getting the tranny mounts lined up with their bolt holes.

Of course, if you were weaned on VW Type 1s, you may think this is
natural.  But there is certainly nothing "wrong" about taking both out as a
unit.
