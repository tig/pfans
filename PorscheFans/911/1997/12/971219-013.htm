     You may remember that a couple weeks ago I posted a memo looking for
advice on an oil leak in my 73 T.

     For what it is worth, here is what I have found (so far).

     Now that the car is on jack stands for the winter, I removed the MFI
air filter housing and found a good bit of oil on top of the engine.
Poking and probing revealed that the cold start thermo switch had vibrated
loose to only finger tight.  Having applied a bit of thread sealer it is
now securely in place and I am awaiting the spring season to see if that
solves the problem.  Incidentally, I have disconnected the wire because the
car is driven mainly in warm weather and I am apprehensive about the
thought of raw gasoline heading down the stack in the event that a backfire
drives flames up the stack.  Any thoughts from the group on this?

     Unrelated question:  My wife and I are contemplating a trip to
Northern California and Oregon in the fall of 98.   The short term focus is
a two week getaway with the longer term idea of prospecting for a
retirement home.  Would appreciate any travelogue thoughts from those on
the list living in the area.  Looking for interesting driving roads, bed
and breakfasts, overnight stops, small interesting communities,
restaurants.  We are more small town people than big city night life types.
Any and all thoughts greatly appreciated.  I liked the comment from the
Oregon guy on today's digest that said "A/C not required".
