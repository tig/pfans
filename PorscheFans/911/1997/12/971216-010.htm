Pull the cap off of the dist. and twist the rotor.  It should move
several degrees and then snap back when you let go.

Pull the vacuum lines off and hook up a hose with a vacuum gun (or suck
with your mouth on each fitting, one at a time.  The plate in the
distributor should move and then return when the vacuum is released (it
will move in opposite directions, one line will be your vacuum advance,
the other is the vacuum retard.  When applying the vacuum, be sure that
it is held and does not leak down. 

If any test fails, the advance/retard mechanism is defective.  The
vacuum advance control (Bosch PN# 07180) is available as a seperate
part.  It pushes/pulls the distributor plate (depending upon which
fitting you hook up to), and can leak or just be stuck.  The plate
inside the distributor can become fozen, or stiff, but can usually be
cleaned and lubricated.

If the rotor does not twist and then return, the mechanical advance
mechanism is stiking.  Getting the dist apart to repair this can be
tricky and is best left up to a professional mechanic.

Another way to test the distributor is with a good digital timing light
that will give you actual readings.  The advance/retard mechanism can
also be checked this way with the engine running.  If you suck on the
retard line (closest in-should be blue), the timing should retard.
Sucking on the advance line (furthest out line-should be red) should
advance the timing.

The proper way check the centrifugal advance timing on your 81 would be
to disconnect and plug the vacuum lines.  Check your timing.It should be
between 15-20 degrees before TDC at 3000 RPM, and between 19 and 25
degrees at 6000 RPM.

To check vacuum retard, plug in the blue (retard) hose to the closest in
line...the timing at idle should be 3-7 degrees AFTER TDC.

To check for vacuum advance, plug in the BLUE (yes, the blue hose) into
the furthest out line...the advance...adjust idle speed to 950+-50rpm. 
The timing should be 8-12 before TDC.

Note:  the blue line should have vacuum with the engine at idle, the red
line will have vacuum with the engine reved up slightly...if these
conditions are not present...look for a broken or clogged line

To set the timing correctly, disconnect and plug both lines, set the
idle speed to 950+-50 rpm.  The value is 5 degrees before TDC.  Plug
both lines and reset the idle speed to 950+-50 rpm.  Test drive.
