John,

I would guess that the "clumping" sound you hear going over speed bumps
is a worn out shock.

I was examining my front suspension yesterday and I noticed that one of
my
tie rod ends was very loose.  As the car has 154K on it I am going to
assume that my suspension components are fairly worn out.  Should I
replace
my tie rod ends and the ball joints, just the tie rod ends, or just the
ball joints?  Also, has anybody else ever noticed their cars making a
clumping sound when going over a speed bump?  Mine does.  It sounds like
something is loose, but I don't know what it could be.  It is coming
primarily from the right side of my car, whereas the loose tie rod is on
the left side of my car.  What are the typical suspension repairs that
should be made to a car as old as mine in order to restore proper
handling
capabilities?

John,

I replaced most of the components that wear out on my 76 911s.  It took a
while, but I did alot of other stuff also (new gas tank, repainted the trunk,
etc.).  

In the job, I replaced the suspension bushings, tie rods, shocks, and torsion
bars.  I also repainted the arms, installed a bump steer kit and a new master
cylinder.

Tie rod replacement was pretty easy, I upgraded to turbo tie rods and
recommend that others do the same.

I've got a bunch of photos of the project on my web page at:
http://members.aol.com/jhelgesen/johnpage.html

It's been a while since I updated it, but I'm sending it to the paint shop
next month, so I'll be updating it then.  There is also a link to my garage
sale page.

Let me know if I can answer any questions
