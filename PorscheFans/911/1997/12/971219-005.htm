It never ceases to amaze me how brain dead some people can be and still
survive day to day.

Another dumb/not smart thing seen.

On one of my last visits to my wrench ( just a hi how are ya, thank god) He
pulls me to one of the back areas for a you just got to see this one. 
Laying there was a Targa Top that was pretty badly bent up and needed to be
totally replaced to the tune of what $4000.

Seems the owner of this car decided that it was a nice day so he should 
"put the top down".  Unlocked it, pushed it up..all right so far.  Problem
was he neglected to slow down from the 70+ MPH he was traveling at down the
interstate.

Another one that has to hire someone to come in and remind him to breath
when he wakes up in the morning.

MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND MAY NO ONE HAVE ANY THING BREAK THAT CAN'T BE
REPAIRED FOR UNDER 20.00 IN THE COMING YEAR. (One can always dream)
