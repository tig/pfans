Hi John,

The rear suspension bushings on older cars are often collapsed. The rubber
between the suspension links wears away to nothing and you have metal to metal
contact. This is not surprising since they have bearing weight for 25 - 30
years. Yours may not be collapsed, they may just need a good drenching with
some rubber lubricant. There is also a chance a previous owner replaced the
rubber bushings with harder plastic bushings. It is common for these to squeak
..

Contemporary tests of early 911 always complained of wind noise. If a careful
inspection of the windshield gasket, trunk weather stripping and door weather
stripping look normal, then the wind noise is a feature.

Best wishes with your new 911.

Bill
