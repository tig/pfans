Finished rebuilding my top last weekend.  By reading all of the information
available on the P-fans list and on the "Poor Man's Porsche" site I gained
from other's experience.  This information covers the basic topics well and
I won't repeat it here.  Below are some of the new lessons learned in the
order of the process:

	o  Get the skin and headliner from World Upholstery.  Quality seems good,
price is right, and delivery is quick.

	o  Estimate a long time, then double -- I hoped that the inner components
on my top would be in good shape.  Turns out that I had to replace the
burlap and edge material.  Doubled the time.

	o  Tear down was straight forward.  Mark the location of the door seals,
this is a good starting point for reinstallation.

	o  Buy the quart paint can of contact cement.

	o  *** Don't "straighten" the bends in the aluminum panels.  The factory
manual describes fixing leaks by bending the panels.  Chances are that your
panels are bent to the best shape already.  Straightening them creates more
work and creates leaks.

	o  The "tuff" stuff on the ends of the panels is difficult to replace
because it necessitates realigning everything.  Add 2hrs for this.  If you
need to replace it, here are two suggestions for material a)strips of
convertible top material 6" wide x 5' long.  b)polyester, curtain edging
from a fabric store (it stiffens the top of curtains to prevent sagging).

	o  Use 1/8 x 1/8 rivets with the rivet washers.  This is the right size,
and you don't want them too long.  I almost second guessed myself.

	o  Double check the alignment of the aluminum panels.  The front and rear
gaps should be approximately the same.  Match mark everything with chalk or
grease pencil.

	o  Try to find the foam covered burlap.  I replaced this with muslin
canvas, and would have preferred the "soft" feeling of the foam lined
burlap.  Durability should be fine though.

	o   *** Make sure to stretch the skin tight.  Next time, I would mark the
location for the first mounting, then partially collapse the frame, and
mount the skin 5mm short of the initial mark.  On the second side, I would
mount it about 10mm short.  Mine is a little too loose.

	o  Don't mount the head liner until the top fits correctly.  I had to undo
a little to stretch the top front to rear.

After installation, I spent a little more time tweaking things.  Here are a
couple of things that dramatically improved the result:

	o  Adjust the location of the frame clips so that they are centered on the
"frame".  Also adjust them so that they are all meet the frame tightly and
that none is ahead or behind the others.

	o  *** I rebuilt part of my side seals using rubber from a bicycle inner
tube.  I smoothed the areas above the fixed windows and created a tight
seal using the inner tube.  This made for a water-tight installation.

	o  If you have wind noise, note the location and gently bend the aluminum
plates until you have a nice consistent seal.

	o *** Remove the top, fold the top, and enjoy the targa!

terry@rpm.com.au asked :

>> That leaves me with what I believe is an incorrectly weighted car. 
My initial investigation to measure ride heights shows up the 
left front to be higher than the right.

 LF is 26 3/16 (665mm)   RF is 25 13/16 (655mm)
 LR is 25 3/8 (645mm)    RR is 25 3/16 (640mm)

Front shocks are Boge, rear  Bilsten.
Looking at the shocks, I think I've found a problem or two...

....So, it seems to me that I have two different shocks on the front 
of the car, and if the stamping is at a consistent height, the left, 
with the higher ride height, is sitting with the shock more 
compressed. <<

Shocks should not cause pull unless one side is high pressure gas
and the other has no pressure (and even this case would not be bad).

Your ride height differences also have little effect on 
pulling but the front is out of spec. 
Even if ride height is dead-even your corner balancing
could be off by a large margin. A level car can have most if
it's weight carried by 2 diagonal corners if the corner
balances are off a lot, and this WILL cause pull even 
at very low speeds. In the extreme your steering wheel
will turn and turn to one side when you are barely moving.

It's too bad that there is no easy cheap way to check
corner balance easily. Check my alignment article
for some more info about corner balancing.
