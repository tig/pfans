Hey P-fans!

I could use some input / advice.

On Wed. Dec. 24 I was heading home from work in my 72 911T and noticed =
the oil pressure gauge was reading very low.
I immediately stopped and shut the old beast down.  One of the oil lines =
going to the oil tank (oil return?) had cracked and was pouring oil all =
over the place.  I may have driven 2 miles with little or no pressure =
and am concerned about engine damage.  The motor made no unusual sounds =
and had not even gotten to a real operating temperature (less than 150 =
degrees showing on oil temp gauge) , but would that indicate true =
temperature due to the lack of oil??  I waited for a tow truck for 2 =
hours....during this time what appeared to be about 2 quarts of oil was =
under the car in a huge puddle.  I disconnected the coil wire and turned =
the motor over for 3 or 4 seconds to listen for anything unusual but all =
sounded fine.

I plan on replacing the line, changing out filter, etc....and see what =
happens!!  Could someone recommend some things I might check out or look =
for during this process!

Thanks in advance for your responses!!      =20
