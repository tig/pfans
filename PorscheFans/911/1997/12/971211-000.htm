First, three cheers for Ross Parker for his help rescuing the List from 
oblivion!

	~~Some foul scumsucking toad has broken the mast off my electric antenna, 
leaving it dangling on its plastic center core. It was sticking, and did not 
always retract fully, despite my efforts to clean/lube it, so it must have 
presented a tantalizing target to roving troglodytes. 
	I was upset to find that the cost of a replacement antenna is rather steep 
for such a low tech part, as dealer quoted me over $200. Dealer also said you 
can't fix the original unit, but that seems absurd... As of now I have 
installed a tacky $17 universal replacement manual antenna, but this is a 
rather unsatisfactory patch.
	Is there a way to fix the existing oem antenna? The mast is dead meat but the 
motor still works fine. The dealer is lying, right....?? 
	All tips appreciated, Warren, '81 SC.
