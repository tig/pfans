Hi all,

I finally figured out why I thought my 83 SC looked funny... The
headlight trim rings, or whatever it's called, are different on my car
than what I grew up seing in Europe. Or different, period. 
It seems that on the euro picturesI got in my books, the trim ring is
much thinner and part of the headlight glass is apparent at sort of cut
at the top. 

On my US Sc, the trim ring wraps completely around the headlight and
even extends slightly forward of it at the bottom. Hmmmm... I suppose I
have just stumbled on something everybodu knows about, but would someone
confirm/ deny this ? 

Can I get euro style front headlights trim or does it mean replacing all
the headlights ? 
(well, repainting them must be costly, too)... What's the deal ?  ;-) 

TIA for any answer ! 

Greg 


PS: My car is getting raised as we speak, 1/2 way between what it was
and stock settings, the mechanic said stock settings made it look like a
4WD sports ute, so we compromised !
