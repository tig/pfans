Mr. Myler,

I'm sorry for flying off the handle like that. I seem to have gotten a
little upset over nothing. I've read on this listing of people being
very insistent on saying that all pre-996 type 911s have torsion springs
and therefore do not have MacPherson struts. This drives me nuts. You
were indeed not insisting this and I overreacted. It is a common
misconception that MacPherson struts means coil spring over shock. A
MacPherson strut is actually the type of suspension defined by the links
and their configuration, not the strut itself or the strut and the
spring together. I don't have a perfectly accurate picture of a
MacPherson strut type suspension in my head but there are many good
references. Millikan's Race Car Vehicle Dynamics book is very good, but
expensive if you're not used to buying technical books. The Bosch
handbook has it defined as well. This is a great reference for anyone
into cars. Probably all suspension or vehicle dynamics type books will
have the definition of a MacPherson strut suspension as well as other
types of front suspensions. Generally there is only MacPherson strut and
double wishbone. I think. There are many variations of these of course.
That is why I think there is so much confusion. A MacPherson strut
suspension is very common, but they're all different from car to car and
very few adhere to the exact type in the original patent by Mr.
MacPherson. I think this is actually who invented it. Let's all agree
that they have MacPherson struts and I promise not to freak out anymore. 

We should get back to tanks. Wait isn't this about 911s? Actually the
tank thing was interesting anyway. :)
