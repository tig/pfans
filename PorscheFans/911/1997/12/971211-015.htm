Hello,

To those who remember, I have a '79 SC that runs for a minute or two,
then dies.  The suggestions I've gotten were that it could be cam
timing, bad gas, or a clogged muffler.  Several people told me it
probably wasn't cam timing since it runs smooth for the 1-2 minutes that
it does run.  I didn't completely drain the gas tank, but I got it down
to a couple of gallons, then I added 5 gallons of fresh gas with
injector cleaner/water absorbent.  This didn't seem to have much
effect.  Also, it what seems to be normal pressure for exhaust coming
out.  This is of course subjective, especially when I haven't had it
running normally for 8 months.
    However, the one huge clue that came up when I ran it tonight was
that the middle fuse was glowing red (pretty obvious when it's dark out)
and burned out while the engine died.   I accidentally left my wiring
diagrams in the car (not anywhere near me), but I think I've tried to
trace this before because I've replaced this one and the bottom one once
or twice in the past month of troubleshooting the car and I was unable
to find something that would obviously be blowing them.
    The mechanic/shop owner on site went to bed by the time this
happened, so I couldn't ask him about it; but earlier he was telling me
he thinks it is a CIS problem.  He's offered to give me some 40mm Webers
for $400 (minus manifolds), which I figure would be cheaper then taking
it to a dealer, so I may take him up on the offer if all else fails.
