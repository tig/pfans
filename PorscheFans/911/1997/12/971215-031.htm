Greetings all,

I am considering doing major upgrades to the worthless aftermarket AC
system on my 80 Euro 911SC targa.  In addition, I am wondering if I should
switch to the new refrigerant due to the fact that freon-12 is rare and
extremely expensive.  Is the process as simple(?) as switching to a
different compressor?  Does anything else have to be done to the system?
Will the system work as well (thats a subjective term, from what I
understand) with this new compressor and the rest of the older AC parts?

Does anyone know where to obtain such a compressor, or the brand of one
that does the job?  How many hundreds of dollars would this thing cost?

Can I do this work myself?  I suppost that the EPA will jail and arrest me
for releasing the freon in the system to the atmosphere if I bleed the
system and then swap compressors or other AC components.  However, if this
feat is accomplished, what do I do to recharge the new system?  In the past
I have added freon to the existing system by following the procedure on my
old recharge kit - checking the pressure, and while the system is running,
adding freon to the low pressure side.  What is involved in charging up a
completely drained system?  Does it need to be evacualted under pressure
first?  Especially if I am doing the regrigerant swap?  Any info would be
greatly appreciated.  The summers here in Nevada are quite hot, I have
found.....I want to get a jump on the heat while I can!

Thanks to all

Rob
