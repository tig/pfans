Hello

I have a Sportomatic 911 with 145,000 kms on it.  The Sportomatic trans
has just failed.

It needs a new diaphragm.  

The part numbers are:

Original # = 914 116 721 15

Superceded #  = PCG 116 721 05

Exchange # = 905 116 721 X

The reason for the 3 part numbers is that you can get an original one,
or a superceded one from somewhere else or an exchange one where you
send yours in and get someone elses in return.

I can get a used one from a wrecked 911 in Adelaide, South Australia for
a very low price but I'd prefer to get a new one.  Also, I can get a
whole Sporto trans too from someone else but again I'd rather repair my
one - "better the devil you know ... "  I want to stay with the
Sportomatic transmission because they're really easy and comfortable to
drive.  With only 3 gears you simply don't change as often so there's
less changes required.  Makes sense to me.

Does anyone have any ideas or know where I can get a new diaphragm. 
It's a cannister shape and operates the clutch.  My Sportomatic
transmission is a 3-speed.  It has Park, Neutral, Reverse and the 3
forward gears named L, D1 and D2 but I call them 1st, 2nd and 3rd.

If anyone has a NEW whole Sporto trans I'd like to know that as well as
how much, etc.

This problem is the equivalent of the clutch pedal not depressing in a
manual 911.  Same part of the car.
