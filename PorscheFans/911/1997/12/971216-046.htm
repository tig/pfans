they are really bad.... i ordered them thinking that they were actually
aluminium, and they are silver paint on the regular dial..
the paint flowed poorly and the letters/numbers looked bad..  the back
layers which illuminate when they are lit were roughly hand blocked in. the
dies used to cut them out were poorly designed and further modifications to
the dials were needed.  the other colors may be better..

i got charged a 25% restocking fee when i returned them...

esssentially i was taken.
