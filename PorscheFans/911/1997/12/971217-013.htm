     A few days ago there was some discussion on starting our cars with
very low batteries.
     It was suggested by some, that if the battery had enough "juice" to
crank the engine it was OK to start and go.
     I really disagree with this idea, it demostrates the good old "theory
vs reality" syndrome.  To follow this practice regularly, the result will
be postings like "wanted- starter motor, alt, where is the regulator, etc."
     Here are some facts to consider.
 1. Fully charged automotive batteries measure 13.2 volts, not 12     as
was stated. A reading of 12 volts is indicative of a battery     that is
about 60% charged. Lead acid batteries measure 2.2 volts per cell @ full
charge.            
 2. The systems on our cars are designed to work best with     functioning
batteries at near full charge.  The starter and                           
solenoid are built to do their jobs at the designed voltage.
Cranking with low voltage heats, and arcs the solenoid, arcs        
brushes in the starter, creates excessive heat in the starter
(doesn't improve the magnets) and doesn't turn the engine at the designed
speed. There is also the possibility of having the bendix disengage,
damaging the bendix and the ring on the flywheel.
 3.  It is unfair to ask the little alternators to chuff their guts out
trying to be like a big battery charger as we see in service stations. Our
alternators are designed to maintaine the battery voltage, not to bring
them up from near dead.  On newer cars alternators will blow out if you try
to run on a bad, or low battery.
 4.  The ignition system is designed to run on a nearly fully charged
battery.  Run on low voltage and you will have a weak spark, possible
missing and plug fouling.
 5.  Your car will have less power to the ground because of the added power
required by the alternator to charge a low battery.

     In summary, it just doesn't make sense to strain these devices beyond
their design envelope, when all you need to do is put your trickle charger
on the night before. It is a lot more fun buying, and fixing things you
don't need to, than repairing things you broke.     whew!

     Now, we all know that air expands when heated, right?  So what would
be wrong with starting out with our tires somewhat underinflated. After
they get real hot the pressure will increase and all is well, ???

     This message was not designed to offend anyone, I had humour more in
mind!
