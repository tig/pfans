 Daniel van Niekerk reminds us of the necessity of replacing the old style
hard rubber chain ramps.  One has to wonder if any of those are still to
be found in running engines.  I thought Glenn Pratt had an SC or some
such, which came with plastic ramps.  You don't hear of those breaking
(which is good) although I discovered a broken plastic ramp in my race
engine (luckily it hadn't caused any problems, but had me wondering
why it broke).  However, with all respect to Daniel, I don't think you have
to take your engine out to change ramps.  I just changed two ramps
(somehow I had the brown ramp in the wrong place), and while I did
have the engine on a stand (which certainly makes everything you do
much easier), I could have made the change with the engine in the car. 
And it won't affect timing.  The ramps (pre 964/993 style) are not under
any real pressure.  They just keep the chains from bouncing when
running, as far as I can see.  While I admit I have never come closer to
the old hard rubber style than a Bruce Anderson demonstration, they
function the same and are held in and installed the same way, so you 
can get them out and replaced with the engine in the car with little more
effort than it takes to change tensioners (and a lot of care to make sure
one can't fall into the bowels of the case, though even then you'd have a
fighting chance to fish it out).
