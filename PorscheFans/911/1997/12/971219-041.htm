Thom,

Spokane is part of the great Inland Empire Porsche Club.  That chapter
covers a large geographic area and the leadership tends to move from place
to place over the years.  The current president and many of the leaders live
in Spokane and they are a most active, friendly and knowledgeable group. 
You will find everything from first rate Speedster restorations (as in first
time in the rain ever last summer during a club event in the Tri-Cities
about 150 miles south and west of Spokane.) to Boxters and everything in
between.  As I recall there were about 60 Porsches for our last summer
dinner at the Columbia Crest winery at Patterson, WA, about 30+- from
Spokane and a similar number from the Tri-Cities.  There are two road track
facilities and also several crazy formula "V" jocks in Spokane as well.  I
lived there for 19 years and doubt if you will find it as much of a
"paradigm shif" as you might imagine.  Welcome!

Jerry Work
73.5 Targa
Pasco, WA, one of the three "Tri-Cities" and also part of the  Inland Empire
Porsche Club.

    Regarding the thread that included:

The time from throttle-on to throttle-off, on the other hand,
    isn't constant for all corners... It depends, of course, on the
    distance between the corners.

> What does any of this have to do with 911 Porsches??:).

    Good point... I guess the whole thread should really have
    appeared on the "General" sublist.  Sorry.

I think the "Tavern" list might be most appropriate, only because there is no
"Drug User" list.
