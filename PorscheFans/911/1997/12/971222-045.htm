Hi everyone,

Happy holidays and all the best for the new year...

A friend of mine just finished converting an old 74 to a rocket. He put a
3.2 liter engine in place of the 2.7 it had, new suspension, shorter
gears, new sports seats, roll bar, new paint, the works... It really
handles great, looks great, and it seems much faster than my 85, for sure
quicker through 100, I caught up to him but then backed off at 145 because
of a truck in my lane, he kept going through 150something (he claims) but
he was neck to neck with me till I backed off...

We also went up the mountain and he really left me in the dust, then we
changed cars and I did the same to him (driving his car)... Very
predictable oversteer, much quicker pickup, much lighter car... all in all
I found the project a great idea so I want to try it myself... I think
that older Porsches are more spartan and primitive and a good used egine,
good suspension set up, in combination with the light weight they already
have, I think makes for a truly outstanding and fun car to have...

I'd like to hear from someone who's done something of the kind. What year
project cars to stay away from, what engines to look for (3.0 vs 3.2), and
in general any hard learned lessons you can pass along...

It cost my friend $7,000 for the car, the engine had 220,000 miles, he
swaped it for an '87 60,000mile 3.2, it cost him $6,000, plus all the
extras, it came in at just under $17,000 when it was all said and done...

High, low?... I'm not going to do it myself, I don't have the time or the
knowledge to play with my life like that so if you also know of places in
California that can help me with such a thing, that'll be great...

Thanks in advance,

Spiros
