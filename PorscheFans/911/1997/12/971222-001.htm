To Porsche Fans;

After hearing the complaints about the above, I have to put in my =
experiences with Windward.=20

I am probably one of their worst kind of customers, the orders are =
usually small and I want the best price. Over the last three to four =
years that I have done business with them, they have always returned =
calls and parts have been delivered as they have promised.

I realize that in business, especially over the phone, that =
mis-communications happen.=20

Because of these comments about Windward and other companies, I will not =
always take someone else's bad experiences as the way a Company does =
business.

My experiences with Winward convince me that they are ethical business =
people with the Porsche enthusiast at heart.
