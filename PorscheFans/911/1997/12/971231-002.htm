Bob:

  There are some issues to bear in mind about selecting and using your
'favorite fuel'.

First, the EPA does have a list of what cities are mandated to use
oxygenated fuel during the winter months. I wouldn't necessarily depend
upon a pump sticker considering the Porsche's sensitivity to water in
the fuel.

Second, there are two families of oygenates commonly used by the major
oil companies, Ethanol and Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, or MTBE. The
latter is commonly used nationwide due to its octane-enhancing
properties. Both additives are hydroscopic to different degrees. MTBE
has one nasty side effect; it creates major deposits on valve stems and
fuel injector pintles(tips).

Regardless of which fuel runs best in your car, regular use of a quality
fuel additive such as Chevron's Techron or LubroMoly's Jectron/Ventil
Sauber combo will keep the sharp throttle response and smooth idle
characteristics that Porsches are known for.

More fuel-related information is available on our Web site on page:
"Talk".

Hope this helps.....
