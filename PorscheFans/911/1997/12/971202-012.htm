John Richardson <johnr@intellicorp.com> asked :


>> I recently made a transition from a first generation RX-7 to a first
generation 911.  The single best performance enhancement I made to the RX-7
during my seven years of ownership was the addition of a limited slip
rear-end (at a cost of nearly $400).  Is it possible to make a similar
upgrade to the Porsche.  Mine is a 1971 911T and I would like to use
original parts that were optional on the car when new, if possible.  My
goal is to always have a car in near original condition. <<

Very expensive due to delicate aligning of the ring and pinion gears
and for the cost of the factory LSD. 
Probably a $2,000 bill. Luckily for you it's not needed
at all in a 911 with under 200 HP.

Your Mazda had a front engine and very little grip in the 
rear so a LSD really helped. In a 911 you will not get
much single wheel spin as there is an abundance of grip in the
rear. Also a LSD will make your car plow in tight
turns.
