    Thanks, Bill... I'm glad you liked it.

    Yeah, I think the very best racers are just genetically DIFFERENT
    from the rest of us.

    It's the same in all other fields... Chuck Yeager, for example,
    had such extraordinary eyesight that he could see 20mm cannon
    shells in flight and spot enemy planes 50 miles away.

    Anyway, as long as we're talking about Jackie Stewart...

    Mr. Stewart has said that the last skill he mastered was using the
    brakes... Specifically, taking his foot off the brake pedal
    correctly.

    Some people believe that Stewart was talking about trail-braking,
    but that interpretation doesn't let me segue into what I want to
    talk about, so I'm going to take his remark to mean that the
    hardest thing for him to master was the TIMING of the brake
    application/release.

    Ok... If we accept my interpretation as accurate, WHY is
    Stewart's statement true?  That is, what can make it difficult to
    know when to release the brakes?

    Well, let's see... While you're on the brakes just before a
    corner, a lot of things are going on both inside and outside the
    car -- I covered this pretty thoroughly in that last message -- so
    maybe the difficulty comes from the need to spend your attention
    on the information you're getting from your eyes and the seat of
    your pants, trying to decide when to get off the brakes.

    If that's true, the solution is easy:  Just find a reference
    point -- a rock, bush, crack in the pavement, or whatever --
    that tells you when to release the pedal.  Once you have that
    marker, you don't need to spend any attention FEELING what the
    car's doing in order to know when the time is right; you just
    brake till you see the marker, then release.

    This is fine, but you can take it a step further:  Since you
    know that you want to finish downshifting for this corner just
    before you get off the brakes, you don't really NEED a brakes-off
    marker... Downshifting for the corner always takes the same amount
    of time, and if you get into a "rhythm" where you always release
    the brakes at the same point after you complete your last
    downshift, all you really need is a "begin downshifting" marker.

    If you always start downshifting at the same point, you always
    FINISH downshifting at the same point, and since you have that
    rhythm going, the brake-release happens more-or-less automatically
    after you finish downshifting.

    And... As I said in that last message, you can probably arrange
    your shifting speed and cadence (if you row through all the gears
    on the way down) so that you always start downshifting at the same
    point after applying the brakes for a corner.

    If you do that, then you don't even need a "start downshifting"
    marker.  After hitting the brakes, you always wait the same amount
    of time before you start downshifting... So if you have a
    "brakes-on" marker, the "begin downshifting", "end downshifting",
    and "brakes off" points all follow automatically.

    One final step further...

    Since you don't want to spend any time coasting, you make the
    transition from the throttle to the brakes as quickly as you can
    without unduly upsetting the car, right?  Since "as fast as you
    can" is a fixed amount of time, you don't even need the
    "brakes-on" marker... All you REALLY need is a "throttle-off"
    marker.

    So...

    If you choose your throttle-off point properly, downshift
    sequentially through the gears, and get into a rhythm that
    synchronizes the braking with the downshifting, you can do the
    ENTIRE corner-entry sequence -- throttle off, brakes on,
    downshift, downshift, downshift, turn-in, brakes off (or "brakes
    off, turn-in", if you want to be slow) -- without EVER having to
    look for any reference points beyond that "throttle-off" point.

    Pretty cool, huh?

    Of course, this is all a little simplified; I've ignored the
    fact that the car's behavior will change a little from lap to lap,
    as will the track conditions, the traffic situation, etc.

    Still, I'm sure you get the idea, which is:  If you approach a
    problem (like "How do I know when to take my foot off the
    brakes?") by working BACKWARD through all the decisions that
    necessarily must precede it, looking for the first one that's
    independent of the one before it (in this case, looking for the
    first operation whose timing isn't dependent on the one before
    it), you can solve your original problem -- and all the ones
    between that first independent item and it -- simply by making the
    right decision about that first item.

    On the track, you can take your foot off the throttle at the
    appropriate point, then let the rest of the corner-entry
    sequence happen automatically, which unburdens you from the need
    to deal with all the actions in that sequence, so you can
    concentrate on getting your butt around the track faster.

    Remember Parliament and Funkadelic, the bands that George
    Clinton started in the early 70s?  Jackie Stewart, with his
    obvious sense of rhythm, MUST have been a fan.

    George Clinton sang "Free your mind and your ass will follow" in
    1971.  Stewart won his second World Championship the same year.

    Mere coincidence?  You decide.
