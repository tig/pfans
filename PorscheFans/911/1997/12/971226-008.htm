I've had a battery draw down problem which I have traced to the in dash
heater AC unit.
The small fan located at the back of the unit sometimes remains on. If
the number 1 fuse is pulled, the fan a course stops. When the fuse is
reinserted, depending upon the air temperature, the fan will restart or
not restart.  (If it cold the fan stays on. If it is warm weather the
fan will stay off.  Also should the air temperature turn cold the fan
will turn itself  back on) I have had the unit out of the dash and
disconnected the blue and wires which power the small fan. However I
continue to get an electrical draw of  .35 amps as there seems to be a
relay staying closed.  Is there a temperature sensor somewhere which is
staying hot when of course  it should not be powered with the ignition
turned off.  I hope this is not a bad unit as I'm told the unit, even
used, is expensive. I also don't want to buy a unit and find it's not
the unit but instead something in line between the fuse and the unit
itself.
Any ideas.
