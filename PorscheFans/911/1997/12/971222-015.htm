Find out what mods have been done to the car as many of those were extensively
modified, bigger turbo, better cams, adjustable boost gauge, new spedo that
goes past 80mph (in the US), etc.  One good mod (not that the others are not)
is the replacement of the thermal reactors with a nice set of headers
(depending where you live).  The car will run cooler.

Also the cars came with all leather interiors and the dashs have a habit of
shrinking aroung the heat/AC vents and the sport seats tend to wear where the
driver scrapes his/her 'butt' across the high bolster.

Quite a few of these cars are claimed to have low mileage.  Get the car
checked out as it is an expensive car to repair later.  What color is it?  A
number, including the last ones were imported to the US in custom colors.  I
had a beautiful yellow one.
