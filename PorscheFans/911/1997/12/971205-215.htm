Treit -

The duct tape helps keep the weights from falling off when the wheels =
are very hot from the brakes, and the wheel weight adhesive has =
softened. The problem is not so much the weights coming off while at =
speed on the track (since centrifugal force help hold them against the =
rim), but while the car is stopped or moving slowly. I have personally =
been standing next to a car that just came off the track, and hearing a =
'kerplunk' found a wheel weight had just fallen off the wheel. Nobody, =
especially a racer, wants an out of balance wheel while driving at =
speed.
