Hi Bob,

If your clock is similar to mine, the internal components are a wonder of
Swiss movements with all manner of gears, cogs, toggles, and springs. The
electrical connection periodically winds up a spring that drives the clock
like the old wind up wrist watches. These mechanisms are very small,
percision movements that require lightly oiled pivots (Ah, the days before
the LM555 counter/timer chips).  These pivots can become sensitive to
viscosity of the lubricunt such that when they get cold they slow down/stop
the works. This is my hypothesis which, if true, indicates that your clock
needs to be cleaned. I am amazed at the interest in these clocks -- I
assumed that when these old clocks stopped working on the old 911's the
owner didn't care because the upgraded audio gear displayed the time
digitally.

Regards,
Ron.
