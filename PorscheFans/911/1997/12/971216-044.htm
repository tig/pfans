Usually lurking, not contributing, and own a waterpumper to boot, so
take this tip w/ a grain of salt:

	Is it possible for the tank to be developing a "vacuum" such as a
plugged vent hose? My thought was if the advice for the spark and
advance doesn't help, try leaving the gas cap off next time.

Can anyone give me any suggestions on changing the #6 plug?  I am reaching
over the ac compressor, under an oil line or two and then trying to get my
full sized, grown up, adult hand and wrist into a space that isn't big enough!

I use a Sears, locking, 3" extension on my plug socket and then extend that
with a short universal to reach far enough into the valve cover.  I then fight
to get the rachet on and off of the universal as the combination is too long
to get out of the spark plug opening.

Suggestions?  Thanks for any and all advice.
