Michael Jackson of Seattle asks why his car seems to be smoking while
idling at stop lights (and on startup?).  My suggestions to him:

1) keep careful track of oil consumption.  You don't say how long you
have had this car, but I assume for several years without this
phenomenon, which is why the smoke looks ominous?  You do keep
meticulous oil consumption records, don't you?  No?  Turn in your keys at
once.  Well, actually I don't either, except on trips, so I'd be in the same
boat - wouldn't know if it was down from a quart each 1,500 to a quart
each 600 or whatever.  I'd say that anything below a quart each 500
miles is getting to be quite a lot.
2) pull your spark plugs to see if they are all equally black and possibly a
bit oily.  Replace, and pull the replacements after a couple of days.  What
you are doing is checking to see if all cylinders are behaving equally.
3) do a leakdown and compression test (mainly to see if rings have gone
bad).
4) do a valve adjustment, and while you are at it, push on the side of the
tip of each intake valve with a screwdriver to see how much movement
you get. Or just pull the intake covers and do the push test.   Bruce A
describes this in his book, I think.  I can't remember if the recommendation
is with valve partway lifted (so the seat doesn't help keep it in place), or
with the lifter loose (tdc).  The valve shouldn't really move at all in either
position.  

I think both intakes and exhausts can wear, but worn intakes are more
apt to smoke, because of all that vacuum behind them in the intake
manifolding, plus the fact that the intakes point down from a pocket
which holds oil.  Exhausts won't "suck" hardly at all by comparison, and
their spring pockets drain away from the valve stem.  I've known
mechanics who leave the exhaust valve seals off entirely for that
reason.  Anyway, your engine is at its highest intake vacuum level idling,
which might correlate with when  you notice it.  Might be worth it for you
to follow wife around to see when it smokes.  Does it smoke when she
backs of the gas abruptly?  And for sure coming out of the exhaust
tailpipe?  911s can be pretty leaky, and if enough is shaken or falls onto
hot exhaust parts, smoke can result.

Between all of the above you might be able to figure out what is going on
(worn guides seem a pretty logical first guess).  The question is, if this is
smoking more than you can stand (or burning more than 500 miles/quart,
or fouling plugs in a hundred miles), what to do about it.  Unfortunately,
you can't just pull the oil thermostat and adjust the Muckilteo valve hidden
under it and all will be well for one hour of shop time.

The valves have a nylon (?) valve stem seal on each.  These can be
replaced without taking the motor apart (in theory, one might even do this
with the engine in the car, although I wouldn't be willing to try that), but it
is not easy, as it requires removing the valve springs, and that requires
removing the rocker arms, among other things.  And if the guides are
worn, the new seals won't last awfully long.  The only real cure for
guides which are worn beyond putting up with is to pull the engine, take
the heads off, and have a shop replace the guides.  No magic engine
restorers or whatnot.

Walt Fricke (waiting to see how guides are on his 3.0's heads which
didn't smoke, now in hands of machine shop as part of a rebuild
necessitated by 4 broken compression rings)
