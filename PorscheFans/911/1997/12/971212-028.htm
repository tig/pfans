Sure thing.  Before I posted I was looking into 7" front and 8" rear.  I
heard this somewhere but was looking for verification and actual
numbers.  The Performance Handbook has a nice list of offsets on p. 215
and says that 7x16" 911 offset is 23.3mm and 8x16" is 10.6mm.  

Recommended wheels/tires also lists 7.5" and 8.5" wheels with the same
tire size.  What if any advantage would be gained with the extra .5"
rim.  As far as I see it just adds more weight to your wheel....which is
bad for speed.

comments?
