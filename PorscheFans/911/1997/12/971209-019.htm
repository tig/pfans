PFans:

I'll try this again now that I'm "re-memberized"

Hi PFans:

What is the normal "life" for a clutch in an '83 SC?  I had the clutch 
replaced when I bought the car about 30,000 miles ago.  At the time, the 
odometer read about 38,000.

I'm not certain that the clutch is the problem, though I'll defer to the 
aggregate wisdom of the Pfans.  When I start the car, it idles at its usual 
low grumble but there is a higher frequency descant that comes and goes.  
Slightly depressing the clutch pedal causes it to disappear totally.  I 
have no problem selecting gears and there is no appraent slippage.

What other than the clutch or throwout bearing could cause this?  I don't 
think adjusting the clutch would help, but maybe that's my ignorance 
showing.

If the clutch package needs replacing, I would let my mechanic handle the 
job as I have neither the tools nor facilities to undertake this task.  
Have any PFans had this done recently and how many labor hours are we 
talking about?

TIA for any help or guidance!
