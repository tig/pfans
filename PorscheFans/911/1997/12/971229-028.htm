> This is for Michael Jackson and his "smokin" '78.
> Something you might look at before you rip the car apart is a little
device
> called the cold state valve I believe.  It is located on the driver's
side,
> and a start fuel line from the fuel distributor going to it.  If you have
a
> Haynes manual, it tells how to test this pretty easily.  The problem is
> that they can stick open, making a real rich mix at idle speeds.  When
the
> car is turning faster the rich effect is much less apparent because the
> volume of extra fuel does not increase with the speed.  What this valve
> does is dump raw fuel into the manifold to get the engine going and it
> should close as soon as the engine fires up.
> Hope this helps, cause it's a cheap, easy fix!
> If your problem started suddenly it really is doubtful it is valve
guides,
> as that would be a gradual deterioration. You could have had valve stem
> seal give-up, but the smoke you describe, and fact that it goes away when
> the engine speeds up sounds like a rich fuel condition.
> I had the same problem just one time.  It was after letting the car sit a
> month (not a good idea, but I was out of the country)  This new,
> "reformulated " fuel the started serving about a year ago seems to turn
to
> jelly in fuel systems after as little as two weeks.  All I did was go for
a
> long drive, and top off the tank with new fuel.  The problem went away, I
> hope never to return.
> 
> Incidentally, I have been using Chevron because it is supposed to have
some
> superior additives to keep your fuel system clean.  Does anyone have any
> comments on the best gas to use, and any favorite fuel additives?
