No one else seems to be taking this one so I'll take a shot:

Greg sez:

>There seems to be a gear noise (and I won't even attempt to describe
that one), that can be heard only when "lugging" the car. Basically in
second gear under 2000 rpm (1600 to 2000 basically), and pretty much the
same in 3rd gear... it's kind of like some metal against metal
vibration/ring noise/space time continuum disturbance...slightly higher
pitch than the engine...anyway...

and then later:

>The noise is still there, under 2000 RPM... It really sounds to me like
the noise my Fiancee's car was making when something on the exhaust was
vibrating on another piece of metal, it's hard to tell exactly where it
comes from (rear area, but..). I couldn't see anything rubbing when the
car was on the jacks, so unless one of you comes up with a brilliant
idea, I'll just drive it until it breaks...;-) 

IMHO:

This is the sound 915's make when you lug them.  In my car it 
only makes that noise when I let someone else drive it
and they think they are doing me a favor by lugging it vs
winding it. 

> I'll just drive it until it breaks...;-)

Not to be too harsh here, but driving it that way might
in fact brake it!!  

> Absolutely fine above 2100 rpm, so the easy answer would be "keep it
there", but traffic is what it is and sometimes you must lug a little,
and once you hear a noise, you strive to recreate it !! ;-)

I am rarely in danger of the car getting below 2000 rpm.  It's
just too dang much fun to shift!
