Dag-Eric asks how to remove his "slightly stuck" engine fan from the
alternator without taking the whole blower housing apart.  

You don't need to take much of anything apart, and I am not sure what
help that would be anyway.  You've just got to loosen the fan from its
perch on the alternator shaft.  After taking the fan belt and pulley half
and washers off (which I bet you have done already), put the nut back
on part way and use a "chatter gun" with a blunt end pressing straight
on the end of the shaft (on the shaft's axis) while pulling the fan toward
the rear with your other hand.  Once it starts to move at all, you should
be able to stop and just slip the fan off. Vibration loosens the fan.  Don't
loose the Woodruf key when you get the fan off. 

A chatter gun is just an air chisel tool with a suitable tip.  I welded a fat
washer onto the end of some other tip, but someone must sell something
like this too.  Really useful for pushing cam housings off of heads, and
splitting cases.  You could maybe do this with a pointed end tool also,
keeping it right in the center of the shaft where the little dimple it makes
won't hurt anything.  

At odd moments, like when exposing what may be my bad practices to
the world, I wonder if there are problems with doing it this way, like
messing up the alternator bearings.  No evidence of that so far, though.

I really don't know what one does to get a stuck fan off (and mine
always seem to be at least a little bit stuck) without some way of
inducing a nice vibration, as it doesn't look like any ordinary puller could
be used.  I'd hate to try to pound on the backside of the fan (after
removing the blower housing with the fan as you were contemplating, or
removing the engine cooling fiberglass cover, which isn't worth it with
engine in car) for fear of breaking it.  I broke a nibble out of a fan blade
way back when while trying to use a big screwdriver to hold the fan in
place so I could take the pulley nut off (used car, no tool kit, no brains
either, but it was a 5 blader I was replacing so no harm done except to
pride), and have been gentle with them ever since.
