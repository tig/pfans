Hi Robert:

I recently repaired the clock in a '69 911 which had two problems;
1) the delicate internal works were coated with gunk, very possibly the same
film that forms on the inside windsheild from outgassing of the interior
vinyl. Only requires careful cleaning.
2) an fuse had "tripped." This fuse was designed in an interesting way in
that a spring loaded contact was soldered with tension on it. So if the
contact heats up to the solder melting point the contact breaks. The contact
may have a special formulation or alloy of solder to melt at a particular
temp. I just used normal solder which melts @ ~ 158 degrees C if memory
serves me. Your replacement of the batteries may have caused a spike that
tripped the fuse.
The clock is much easier to work on than the other gauges because the back
is held by only screws and does not require removing the face plate like the
other gauges.
