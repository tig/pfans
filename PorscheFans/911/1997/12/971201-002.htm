Hi all, 

The 911 and I are definitely friends now. I drove it about 600 miles
since I got it, and I am now more confident it's not going to blow up on
me and a little less paranoid about leaving it in a parking lot....The
front end still shakes like an egg beater at 72mph, but we'll see about
that this week, when I raise it back to original specs and check out the
bearings... 

Last wave of newbie questions, so I can sleep better...

- The PO had an extra oil cooler installed (in front of the passenger
front wheel). Am I right in assuming this implies more oil than
indicated in the manual at oil changes ? If so, how much more ? (and go
ahead, laugh, but it took me 10 minutes before I figured out the
dipstick was inside the damn oil filler tube ;-) 

- sound wise: Before the carrera tensioners update, the car sounded like
a tractor, but it's hard for me to say if that was the old chain
tensioners failing because I had no reference... After the upgrade,
under 3000 rpm, the car is way more silent, and sounds like an electric
car, more of a "wheeeezzzz" sound, is that cool ? Almost sounds like
belt noise....  After 3000, it gets in to barking territory, a throatier
groal that I prefer... Just checking this is normal as once again, I
have no frame of reference ! 

- Gearbox: paradoxically, even though gears are hard (new clutch), I
find 2nd and third a breeze, it's fourth that drives me nuts and
requires the most effort !  Any reason ? 
Oh yeah, and also paradoxically, the gears go in much easier - or at
least the same - if I go straight to them on downshifts than if I use
double-clutching/rev matching... Shouldn't it at least FEEL easier when
you double clutch ? 

Still got that grin on my face....
