Hello commrades,

My 82 SC has factory cruise control, which works intermittently. About 30%
of the time, when the lever is engaged the cruise comes on, and will work
normally on an entire trip with repeated adjustments until the car is shut
off. The other 70% of the time, the cruise will act completely dead from
the moment of startup, and the only chance of getting it to work is to turn
off the car, and reset the odds to 30% of it working when the car is
restarted. Anyone have any suggestions, or have heard of this before?
Incidently, the turn-signal switch needed replacement a couple months ago
because of erratic high-low beam control.

Thanks,

Keith Killian

Subject: Smoking on deceleration temperature-related?

My 1980 SC smokes on deceleration and it appears to me temperature related,
since it is recurring with some recent warm weather, as follows:
1. If Oil temp gauge is a clock face and cold is 7 and the next mark up is at
8, then at about 8:15 I start to get smoke when I let off the gas, say while
leaving a freeway for an off-ramp.
2. At 8 and "earlier" no smoke.
3. No sense of power loss at any temperature that I can detect.
4. Local experts say rings, and the middle right cylinder failed a
compression/leakdown test over six months ago.
5. Problem was much worse during the long hot Houston summer, but went away
with the fall and has only recently recurred, in a much milder fashion.
TIA,
George Bigham
