The addition of an external oil cooler really shouldn't affect the amount
of oil needed for a change since you can't get much of the oil in the
lines/cooler out of the car when draining the oil.

Here's what I do (on all of my vehicles) to ensure I add the right amount
of oil back during an oil change:  I pour the used oil into milk jugs (a
container our local oil recyclers accept) and in doing so, get a pretty
good measurement of how much oil came out of the car.  I then add
approximately this amount back to the engine.  This method at least
gets you in the ballpark - I usually err a little on the low side and then
top it off to bring it up to the correct level.
