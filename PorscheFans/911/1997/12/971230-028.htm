Ending the year on a positive note, I wanted to let the list members know that I did resolve my problem with Automotion.  They had sold me some Pertronix "ignitor" pointless ignition units that turned out to be defective.  It took some discussions with customer service and some time, but they did end up doing the right thing.  One advantage of dealing with a reputable company!  

At least one of my messages to this list caught the attention of folks at Automotion, and I have to think that my discussion of their performance within their core base of targeted consumers helped to speed the resolution of the problem.  IMHO, we have a tremendous resource in this list.

Best wishes for the new year to all P-fans!
