Hi, '73.5 911T here...

The driver's side CV shaft makes the typical clunk-clunk-clunk, ONLY when
the weather is cold, and only for the first few miles of a trip.

Common sense (which may be fawlty) tells me that if a CV joint were truly
worn out, it would clunk-clunk-clunk ALL THE TIME.  I'm thinking that once
the car warms up a bit, the little bit of grease that's there begins to
flow back into where it needs to, thereby quieting them down; and I would
just need to repack my joints.

Faulty logic?  I'd like to save the $$$ of replacing joints if they're just
dry.

The seals are fine, by the way.

Thanks!
