Greetings,
   I'm new to the group as I'm seriously considering buying a Porsche for
my next sports car. I'm currently looking at a 77 911 Targa with 151,000
miles. The car is in great shape with BBS wheels, good rubber and a recent
compression check resulted in 155-165# on all 6. Car doesn't appear to be
leaking oil and runs real well except for a little bit of grinding in 2nd
gear (shift up or down...although it could be me...NOT!). Don't know how
big of an issue this is. I have a GTI currently that's had the same problem
for 3 years.

   The car is being sold by a dealer, with whom I've dealt with before, but
since I don't really know the history of the car...Anyway, the car is
priced at $6500. From what I've been able to tell from Kelly Blue Book and
other such sources, this is a good price. Can anyone tell me if I'm wrong
in thinking this? And can anyone suggest other things I need to be aware of
in checking out the car? I intend to have my mechanic check out the car, as
well. But, I need a little additional guidance as to whether I'm making a
sound purchase. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

TIA
Steve
