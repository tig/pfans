Hello to all!   I have been lurking and am too anxious to wait any longer.



I want to buy a 911, from what little I know there was a cam chain tensioner

change in 1980 that resulted in a much more reliable car.  So I am looking
for

a 1980 or newer car.  Style wise I prefer the Targa but am open to all.  Any

recommendations you all might have as to better years/models would be

appreciated.  I  would consider any drivable condition.  I want to drive
this

car daily.



Suggestions on where to look, what to pay and someone in the Chicago area
who

could give me a competent appraisal as to value would be greatly
appreciated.



Thanks Ben,  Woodworking machinery dealer and wanna-be 911 owner

--------------------------

Just a few words regarding your post -
In a "wanna-be 911 owner"'s quest for a 911, take the cautionary stance that
what you think you see, may not be what you get.  If you are buying from an
owner who has reciepts and appears to have knowledge of what has been done to
the car while he/she owned it, and hopefully the same knowledge level of
previous owners, you are in much better shape.  What I wanted to get across
is that a previous owner may have installed either earlier or later versions
of the chain tensioners.  The later versions - beginning in 1984 - called
"Carrera tensioners" or pressurized tensioners, are obvious on inspection of
the chain cover area of the engine.  Earlier tensioners can only be
identified by removal of the chain covers.  Pre-1980 tensioners will fit
post-1980 911, so the VIN number alone won't guarantee what you will find
inside the engine, or other well-hidden places on your new purchase.  Of
course, I don't have any magic methods to uncover these hidden secrets, just
use good judgement, and other tactics I'm sure will be suggested to you by
other P-fans.  Using the chain tensioner criteria alone may steer you away
from a good buy in an earlier car which could have the later tensioners
installed.

Happy hunting!
