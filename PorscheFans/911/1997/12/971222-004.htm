Scott Breeding's problem with his intermittent wipers inspired me to 
take a closer look at why my 80SC intermittent won't work. 

I pulled the fuel/oil level guage to get access to the intermittent 
switch., removed it and cleaned the contacts, re-installed and bingo, 
it worked.

As I was congratulating myself, I closed the driver side door with 
the wipers still going. As soon as the door closed, the wipers 
stopped!

A little playing around with the door switch confirms that the 
intermittent wipers will work with the door open and the interior 
light on, but as soon as the button is pressed to simulate the door 
closed and the interior light goes out, the intermittent stops.

Can anyone with any more than my pitiful knowledge on these cars help 
me out here on where to start looking for what's wrong. My guess is 
that it is some kind of open circuit.

Also, does anyone have a source for the Haynes manual that I can 
order over the net?

thanks
