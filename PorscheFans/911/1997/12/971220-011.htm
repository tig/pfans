Ted Arneson, a gentleman of considerable perspicuity, impeccable taste in
automobles and a (demonstrably) nearly infinite tolerance for twits,
patiently responds to one:

> Mr. Romero/Porsche & Ferrari list members,

[an astonishingly restrained response is ruthlessly snipped here]

> As far as "look-at-me, I'm cool but clueless" owners, every marque has their

(ummm, brother Ted, does it not occur to you that you've been addressing
the Poster Child for the terminally clueless, yer kindly ol' Unka Bart idly
wonders...)

Not only that, Clyde old kumquat, but yer kindly ol' unka Bart even knows
one or two Porsche owners who can string several words together, many of
which are properly spelled even, to form a reasonably coherent declarative
sentence, complete with proper punctuation and capitalization.

Oh dear!  Sorry, that wasn't nice of me, was it?  Making such a fine,
erudite fellow as yourself turn such a bilous shade of green with envy like
that...

Well, Clyde, old rutabaga, it seems you already have a fine automobile.
Now that you do, why don't you toddle off and get yerself a freakin' *grip*?

You'll find it to be ever so useful, should you ever stumble across a clue...

Yer kindly ol' Unka Bart, who wishes you, every one, a Salubrious Solstice
Seasonal Celebration of your choice, and a Happy, Safe and Prosperous New
Year.
