Subject: First impression 996

Hi,

When I was visiting the dealer last week to get some parts, I said to
the mechanic that I was surprised to see so many Boxter's standing in
the showroom. He said look again , and indeed on second look  there
they were standing the NEW 996's. From a distance an exact copy of the
Boxter but once you get closer there is a distinct difference.

First impression, they are BIG. I could compare a 993 S with a standard
996 (lined up nicely together) , and what a 'small' car is the 'old'
993. Looks great from the side, but you will not be impressed if this
cars overtakes you. The back looks almost a copy of the 928, but then
without the Porsche lettering and big fenders. No aggressive looks
here. (Must provide great business opportunities for the aftermarket boys
!!!)

When opening the driver's door, I was impressed by the good looks
inside. Far and far better than any picture I have seen !!!. Great
driving position, and instruments are well clustered. Very modern looks
and superb quality, especially in the car with the full leather option.
However sitting in the front passenger seat, it suddenly no longer
looks great, but rather chaotic. But who cares, it is all about being
in the driving position or not.

Very small wing in the back, actually no longer required for cooling,
just high speed stability only. Sound is very similar to the Boxter,
not really 'screaming' anymore (although we did not rev it very high,
new car you know). Nice gadgets such as the windows lowering themselves
when you open the door, and up again when you close the door, back-up
warning device if you go to close to an obstacle at the rear. (Looks
like some Japanese guys had some input, but really do we want a sport
car to be equipped with these gadgets ? No, I don't)

For the mechanics it must be a nightmare, can't see hardly the v-belt
or alternator, it is really packed to the extreme.  Cooling system is
meant to be sealed for live. So the 'do-it-yourselves' will have a
serious problem in the future.

Overall beautiful car, for those who are looking for a refined
sports-car. But the aggressive looks are gone.

Bye, Dirk

Dirk,

I agree with you on pretty much everything. I drove one in Switzerland a
couple of weeks ago. A very nice car with superb quality. It's more a
boxter than anything else, even looks like one...

I was very dissapointed to tell you the truth. I think 928/944/Boxter
drivers will love it, but I feel most 911 enthusiasts will hate it...
because it's not a 911...

I really hope that Porsche will go back to the more primitive look soon,
the look that made most people buy 911's in the first place. I feel the
new 911 is moving towards the Mercedes end of the road and I don't like
it. too many gadgets, too refined a feel, too easy to drive fast, too
perfect...

my 2c worth...
