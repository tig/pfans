> Dave:
> If you're talking about the three fuses in the engine bay, one is for
> Sportmatic cars, one for the rear window de-fogger and the other for
> the heater blower.  If it runs for several min. and dies consistently
> my first guess would be fuel starvation.  I'd check pump flow rate and
> change the filter.  Next would be CIS primary pressures.  Warm up
> regulator control pressure should start at 1.4 bar and increase to 3.8
> or so after 3-5 min.  If this time coincides with your engine dieing
> it could be that the regulator pressure goes to 5 bar which would shut
> off the flow from the fuel distributor but there are a lot of other
> things that can cause fuel starvation.   If I where standing by the
> car and didn't have a gauge set I'd start the car with the air cleaner
> out and removed.  When the car quits reach in and lift the air plate
> for the fuel distributor immediately.  If you don't hear the injectors
> "whine" they are out of fuel and you at least know why it quit.
> Another clue would be how long do you have to wait between starts and
> how long does it run and at what RPM??.  A torn boot between the
> throttle body and the fuel distributor would let the car start but
> only run briefly before it dies because the airplate doesn't lift in
> the air flown and open the slots in the fuel distributor piston.
