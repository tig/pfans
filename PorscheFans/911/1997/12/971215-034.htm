Jim Alton, with impressive credentials, says it should be safe to start an
alternator equipped car if the battery is sufficiently charged (after
previously being discharged) to turn the engine over.  Sounds right to
me, but this suggests by inference that one should NOT start an
alternator equipped car if the battery is not sufficiently charged to start it.
 I have "learned" through installation of battery cutoffs on race cars that
one should not allow an alternator to produce current/voltage when
there is no battery at all in the system (i.e., when the big switch has
opened the lead to the battery).  Something about burning out diodes, a
suitably scary and plausable sounding thing so that I have always
carefully arranged my battery cutoffs so they wouldn't do that.

However, think of all the times when you found your car's battery dead
for some reason (left trunk up for a week in garage, forgetting about the
light in it, whatever), so you just push started the car.  It fired to life either
because alternator produced enough juice right away or because even
the dead battery was enough to produce a spark?  And ran on the
alternator as the battery recharged?  (My age may be showing when I
confess that I used to do this with cars which had mere generators,
which I guess are an electronically less finnicky piece of equipment).

Have I gotten away with push starting alternator equipped cars at
various times only because God looks out for fools?  Or is it sufficient
that there be a battery, even one with very little if any charge in it, to give
the electricity the alternator produces a suitable home and path to
ground, and prevent magical development of voltage spikes backward
through the diodes or whatever it is which can damage them?
