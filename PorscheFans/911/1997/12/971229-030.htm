First, thanks to everyone for the education!  I am amazed at the amount I
have learned.

I am considering a brake upgrade for my stock 86 Carrera.  I know very
little about this subject so I am open to all comments.  I want to upgrade
to, at least, 930 brakes.  

1.  What is the best way to do this?
2.  Do I buy the parts new from someplace like Design, or should I look for
used parts in Pano?   If used, I'm not in a big hurry, so I can scan Pano
and other sources until I find the correct parts. 
3.  Does anyone have a complete parts list of what is required?
4.  Will there be a big difference if I only upgrade the fronts?  ( I heard
this suggestion at a DE event)
5.  Can I use my stock 16" Fuchs if I use stock 930 rotors?

I have seen very little information about this type of upgrade in the
archives.  Is a conversion like this worth the $$ or is another upgrade
better to begin with?  (ie exhaust.) 

Thanks in advance.

About 10 minutes into my evening drive I notices a steadily climbing oil temp
guage.  The oil pressure and level readings were normal, and the engine was
running as smooth as ever.  I stopped the car and switched off the ignition.
I checked the oil level with the dipstick; it was full.  There was no other
visible problems other than a high oil temp indication. After letting the
engine cool a while I decided to try for home.  The oil temp started climbing
once again.  By the time I pulled into my driveway the oil temp was at the
lower edge of the red mark!  It has been about 1500 miles since the last oil
change.  
As a new 911 owner I don't yet have much experience with the car and would
appreciate any help with this problem.
