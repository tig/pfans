Hi P-Fans, I am thinking of removing the engine and transmission from my =
73. I have a basement garage to work in but really all I have as far as =
tools are 4 jack stands and a small floor jack. Is it possible to get =
the car up enough to get the engine out using just this equipment? I =
have a couple of leaks that I desperately need to take care of. What do =
you folks recommend? I need advice in a bad way! =20
    The leaks that bug me the most seem to be coming from the top of the =
engine and running down the side, and there is a terrible drip coming =
from the center of the crankcase halves. It drips from the center of the =
engine near the rear. I haven't a clue except for possibly the rear main =
seal. Any ideas????
    Thanks in advance. Bryan 73T w/74 2.7
