It seems to vary just which gauge is harder to pull. In my car, the tach
came out easily, ditto the clock, but the speedometer was
impossible--had to go around *that* one to replace bulbs. Going behind
is the idea that makes the most sense, but I've never tried it.

Well, I finished my 11 year project car just last week, it's my pride and
joy...I bought a  1976 914-2liter with no engine or tranny..and after many
years of searching for just the right engine I came up with a 1985 3.2 with
carbs..I paid only $9,550.00 for it and it screams....I bought a used 915
tranny from a wrecking yard (Porsche wrecking yard of course)...I got a really
good deal on the tranny only paid $5,200 for it!! now they are all together
and running...I took my baby out for her maiden voyage two day ago..WHAT A
THRILL!!!!...My friend and I went out on the 405 freeway for a run...he was
following me in his 96 Bi-turbo..too bad for him...I left him in the dirt at
about 145mph, as I was accelerating to 168 mph I looked in my rear view mirror
and saw nothing..He was not even close..well, I slowed down to wait and he
caught up at last...Just then my wife shook me and said ..WAKE UP!!most of the
stories you read on the porschefans are a kin to this one..MERRY CHRISTMAS TO
ALL OF YOU
