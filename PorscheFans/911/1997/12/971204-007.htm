Racers do tape their weights.  Take a close look at pictures or check
out the cars at the track.

Brad:

You're not wrong; it IS baloney... But not necessarily because the
tape gets destroyed; good tape can easily handle the heat of the
wheel.

There are two reasons not to tape weights onto your street car:

    1.  Stick-on weights, if properly applied to a CLEAN surface,
        don't fall off very frequently... And if they do fall off,
        you can just drive back to the tire dealer and have him
        re-apply them (if you've previously noted the position and
        size of the weights by, for instance, putting a little paint
        mark on the tire adjacent to the weight, he won't even have
        to remove the wheel).

    2.  Tape on the outer (visible) rims of your wheels looks
        butt-ugly.

If you remove the tape, do so carefully; if it's REALLY good tape, it
may have adhered to the weights strongly enough to pull them off
the wheel.
