Hope this doesn't post forever or dump us all.

I'll pass on what I believe is the ultimate header/heater solution.  A
company I saw advertised in a VW rag years ago named Instant Auto
Heater, Co. sells an integrated fan and electrical heater grid setup.  I
kept the ad for years and recently sold my SSI's for larger headers so
.... I am installing two in my 82SC where the pipes come from the sill
plate up to the air distribution inlets (have also considered using the
pair as a replacement for the air distribution valves and blowing the
fans one way for heat and another for defrost).  Using at the sill
location allows me to keep the rest of the "oh-so-lovely" heater fresh
air control system intact (excepting the faded red heater valve
handles).

The units come in a wide range of wattage (I believe 240 up at 60 watt
intervals) and start at $169 and were about $30 every 60 watts
thereafter (don't recall fully, I bought in Jan '97).  These units do
draw quite abit (but I believe slightly under advertised), do have to be
hooked directly to battery (using significant relays for control), and
anticipating problems I replaced alternator with later hgiher amperage
to handle increased load requirements.  

The units come for under-dash installation with a basic three wire
hookup (battery and ignition) and I had to separate the fan control from
the heater grid (I used one underdash last winter blowing on my feet and
in 40 degree weather the outlet temp. was in excess of 95 degrees (maxed
out a rinkydink electrical thermostat/temp gauge).  I believe that once
recirculating interior/heated air with two units permanently installed
that I'll need to break up the heater grid into 2 or 3 stages or open
the windows frequently.  I do know that I risk frying the electrical
grid if I don't maintain a balance between air speed and grid temp.  At
first I thought the units looked a little JC Whitless like, but they've
proven durable and well thought out, possibly excepting my modifications
thereof.  

Their phone number is 718-476-2497.  You'll almost always get a
recording (one time I did directory service for their town, Woodside NY
and got a different number that was a phone service/order desk, last I
tried it rolled over).  Don't even think of customer service and/or
asking any technical questions I can't find new ads anywhere (anybody
interested in buying them out and/or making a run on them let me know,
seeing a product poorly managed kicks my entrepreneural instincts
again).  If I find my invoices, I'll provide the better pricing info as
requested.

SOAPBOX TIME - Due to the length of my diatribe(sp?) if you respond to
the list, please don't be lazy and copy the entire thing.  If your a
Porsche purist and you want to flame me for what I've done or the length
of this post then, as appropriate, either 1) get over it, 2)bite me,
and/or 3) give me some of your large/geeters/green and I'll buy a 993
SuperCup or RSR which I promise cross my heart to keep totally stock -
I'll even use Pirelli slicks exclusively (as long as Springer or someone
from Andial promises to visit frequently and adjust my valves).  The
length is meant to explain as much as possible and minimize the number
of responses as I believe posting on the list begets a responsibility to
respond (are some of you listening to this point?).  Some others on this
list more than carry their load and we can  all learn quite a bit buy
actually reading through responses and reviewing the archives before
asking (yeah, I dream of genuine search capabilities but I'm over it). 
Whew, I'm tired. 'Night all
