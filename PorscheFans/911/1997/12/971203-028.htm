They=27ll fit, although you might have to roll the inside of the fender =
lip slightly.  I learned to race in an =2785 Carrera back in =2786, and I =
ran 245/45 x 16=27s in the rear.  A word of caution, though.  If you do =
that, make sure you take the 225/50 x 16=27s off of the rear and put them =
on the front.  Otherwise, you=27re going to further unbalance the car =
(that vintage of 911 doesn=27t handle real well out of the box) and make =
it understeer even more.  After making the tire upgrade, if you haven=27t =
already done so, at a minimum, you should put a set of =22Charlie Bars=22 =
(adjustable sway bars sold by Charlie Spira) on the front of the car, so =
you can dial in the correct balance between oversteer and understeer.

Hi. My 85 Carrera has 205/55-16 front and 225/50-16 rear tires. I have an
opportunity to get 245/45-16 for the rear, but I don=27t know how =
they=27ll fit.
I=27ce asked around and gotten three replies: yes, no and maybe. The local
Porsche dealer says they=27ll fit, my mechanic says no (he=27s pretty good =
and he
owns a Turbo with 245/45-16 on it) and another mechanic says maybe, put =
them on
and see=21 I need to make a decision soon=21 :-=7D So, what do you guys =
think? Thanks.
