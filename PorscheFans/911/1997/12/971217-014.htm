Yipes, if the mechanic suggests it might be the shock, I'd first go find
another mechanic.  The shock will not have anything to do with static
suspension (which is what constant pull definitely is) unless it is seriously
broken, bent, etc., which I'm sure you would have already discovered. 
Replacing the torsion bar is another fairly major measure to take without doing
a corner weighing first to confirm that that corner of the car is very light or
heavy.

I would spend a few bucks (or whatever you use down there :-) and find a place
that will do an accurate corner weighing for you.  My guess is that through the
years your corner weights have moved off of a good balance.  Fixing this
requires only torsion bar adjustment although it is labor intensive; in the
lucky case you can fix a minor imbalance by adjusting the front torsion bars
which are *trivial* (3 minute job).  If the weights are off by a lot (> 10%?)
you will probably need to balance all 4 wheels.

As a preliminary check you could measure your fender lip heights; left and
right should be within 1/4" of each other for a rough cut.  The car must be on
a level (left-right) surface when measuring.

Good luck!
