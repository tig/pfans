    William:

    Your gearbox will be perfectly happy shifting directly from 5th
    to 3rd so long as you properly match engine speed to road
    speed... But that doesn't mean that there's "no reason" to shift
    into 4th on the way down.

    I vaguely recall writing a message on the subject a couple of
    days ago... Did you miss the message, miss the points I was
    making, or just not agree with any of those points?

    Um... Excuse me?

    I agree that using engine compression to slow the car is a bad
    idea, but how does it put wear on the clutch?

    Yes, it does "sound racy", but if it's done properly, it
    shouldn't "feel" ANY different than skipping gears... The whole
    point is to make the downshifts in such a way that the car's
    balance is unaffected.

    Downshifting -- properly -- through the gears puts essentially
    no extra wear on the gearbox, and I still have no idea what your
    reference to clutch wear means.
