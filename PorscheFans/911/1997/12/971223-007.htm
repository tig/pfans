     I have noticed this gurgling sound coming from the passenger side of 
     my 90 C4 also. It sounds like it's coming from the oil tank area. I 
     did not notice this sound until I switched to Mobil 1. I have not seen 
     any rise in oil temp so I believe that all is OK. Yesterday someone 
     wrote that a partially open thermostat could possibly cause this noise 
     to occur. Any answers to this problem would be greatly appreciated.
     
     On tire pressure I run mine at the factory settings of 36/44 and my 
     tires seem to be wearing OK.
     
     Thank You

     Subject: Carrera4 questions
     
     After a long 15 years "between Porsches" I now have a 1991 C4, for 
     which I 
     cannot seem to get answers to three questions:
     
     I have a very pronounced "gurgling" sound in the passenger side door 
     sill, 
     obviously the oil cooler lines which pass through it.  Does anyone out 
     there have the same noise and if so, do you know if it is normal ?
     
     The other one relates to tire pressure.  Porsche says 36/44 (F/R) for 
     standard wheel/tire sizes while  Yokohama says 29/34 for the Nexus 
     high 
     perf. tires (same size as OEM).  The factory specs imply pressure for 
     a 
     total of 4 (!) passengers or 610Lbs. Is there a consensus on what 
     works 
     best for off-track usage ?
     
     Finally, is a strut brace a good investment ?
     
     Kees
