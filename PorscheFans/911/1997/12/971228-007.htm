King, there are externally adjustable rear Koni shocks for the 911. There
are reasons, however, that they may not be the right Koni application for
every car. These units are externally adjustable (rebound) twin tube
hydraulic. The valving of these units is relatively soft and would not be
what I'd recommend for the later heavy cars or cars running much larger
torsion bars.  The unit Koni specs for the rear of your car is a hydraulic
standard adjustable unit. Many people opt for the later style Koni
application ('75-'89) that gives them a high pressure gas mono-tube standard
adjustable shock available in both standard red and sport yellow. These
units bolt right on and offer much firmer valving than the hydraulic units.
The valving of the externally adjustable hydraulic unit is very similar to
the valving of the standard adjustable hydraulic unit although it does offer
a bit more compression or bump force. If your car is relatively stock in
terms of torsion bar size, the externally adjustable hydraulic  units may be
right for you. 

Producing an externally adjustable unit for the rear of the 911 is a "damned
if you do, damned if you don't" proposition. For obvious reason, everyone
would opt for an externally adjustable unit if it were available. Koni made
the rear unit of the C2/C4 externally adjustable. Problem is that you have
to be double jointed and of extremely small stature to get your hand back
there to adjust them. The later cars just have so much crammed in the engine
bay that it makes external adjustment difficult even if it is available.
Hence probably the reason the rear unit on the 993 is standard adjustable.

We have every one of the Koni applications in stock including the externally
adjustable hydraulic unit if you're interested.
