Analog Mike wrote, re R1's, in response to my comments:

I must admit I have had nothing but R1s on my car for at least
the last 5 years but I put VERY little street mileage on 
my car (I have about 4-5 sets of mounted Fuchs wheels
with various size/compound R1s for track and autocross). 
I must say however that running R1s on the street
is not a good idea. You may have "few" failures
but any failure on the street or damage to a good race
tire with tread still left is NG.
______________________________
My "failures" involved road hazards, like nails, etc., that caused the tires
to go flat and shred themselves on the freeway - nothing different that
what has happened on occasion on other vehicles with "normal" tires.


 Several people on Team.net
(autocross list) have had problems driving on their R1s
to and from events. Better to save the tires for competition
and carry a spare set for the street. 
____________________________
I no longer compete - the only time my car gets to the track is when I put
on driver instructional events at Willow and Buttonwillow twice a year. 
Therefore, my R1's get almost exclusively street use, and as I said
previously, I've had essentially no problems and nothing but on-ramp
enjoyment.



P.S. Police officers have very little patience for your
excuse that "the tires come with the outside-half bald and 
not much tread anywhere" and are just looking for ways
to give Porsche owners tickets. I even got grief from tech
inspectors at the drag strip who wanted to send me home
as my R1s were "worn out!!!!"
___________________________
Of all of the times I've been stopped by the Police with R1's on my sports
cars over the last 10 years (and believe me, it's been more than a few),
only once did the Officer event comment on the tires.  They happened to
have been brand new R1's, and when I explained to him that they come
that way (no tread pattern on the outer quarter of the tire), he accepted it
and did not even write it up as a fix-it violation.  Just my experience, and
$.02.
