Sooner or later every do-it-yourselfer (or factory trained mechanic, for
that matter) has to remove and reinstall CV joints (unless he or she only
has a very early car and has kept the Nadella joints).  Early CVs had four
8mm (I think - maybe 10mm?) socket head bolts, plus two locating pins to
join the CV to its mounting flange.  Later CVs use six 8mm socket head
bolts.  These are grade 12.9 bolts, so they are pretty strong.  And, for
the fellow who asked a couple of weeks ago, they don't require any
washers.  However, I have searched in vain in my factory manuals
(volumes 1-6), in my Haynes manual, my Clymer manual, and the two little
spec books I have (one covering the 2.7s, the other the SCs)for a torque
specification for these CV bolts.  Bolts inside the transmission I seldom
see, far less touch, have specs,  numerous other nuts and bolts of
greater or lesser criticality on engine or suspension have torque specs,
but not these CV bolts.

So my conundrum is, what is the factory torque recommendation for
8mm 911 CV bolts, and where is this specified in a factory or factory
derivative publication?

p.s. - cruising the Porsche-related web led me to two fine articles at PCA
region websites (Nordstern being one) by 944 owners about removing,
cleaning, inspecting, putting back together, repacknig, and reinstalling CV
joints.  The authors of these gave 30 and 31 pounds/feet (which sounds
about right) as the appropriate torque without citing a source, but this
doesn't count as authority for a 911. 

Merry Christmas
