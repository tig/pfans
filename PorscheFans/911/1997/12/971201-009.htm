Hi Perry and 911ers!

I had better retract my message before I get into trouble!  Perry, I have
the same literature and your right.  And I may have been mislead but
meeting original owners over the years I have been told that it didn't
matter what the ads read, you just ordered whatever you wanted.  Perhaps
the dealers would actually alter the car after the factory.

Disclaimer:  I don't know how to state the following without starting a
tomato war, just keep in mind that I am just saying that these cars are
pretty quick, you just gotta try one:

As for the performance claim, well I havn't raced every one out there, but
except for 1 race 911RS (we swap FTD back and forth) I have lost very few
races.  (But we don't have a huge 914 class, they can be quick).  Hey maybe
I just havn't run into the right drivers.  Now my 912 is a little prepared,
(1720 big bore, holy smokes! a muscle car) and is running 205/50 R1's so
its not fair to compare to the stock 911s but when the car was stock it did
beat all the stock 911s.  Actually, the toughest competition was a 68 911S
that was stripped.  But this is all mini sprint and autocross stuff.  I do
admit that on the track (like that relates to country roads) some 911s will
prevail.  Depends on the track though!  Forget Laguna, it takes me 3
minutes to get to the top of the hill!  Seattle is tough too, any hilly
tracks are.  Portland is very 912 friendly with short straights and not too
much elevation change.  I guess the big advantage is late left foot
braking, right up to the apex.

Anyway, we have 12 mini-sprints/autocrosses during the summer (APR-OCT)
here on Vancouver Island, and a great tour out to the west coast through
mountian roads, and if it takes a formal challenge to get you guys to come
visit then consider this one!  We would love to have guests visit our VIR
region as we love to visit others. (Especially those with tracks!)  We have
a great 911 class, about 40 cars, very few 914s (I don't know why, thank
goodness for me though cause they'd be in my class!), a good 928 class with
5 cars, several 944s, 1 912, but a thin modified class.  We need some
competition!

I hope to have our schedule up on our VIR web page at
http://platz.com/pca/vir soon.

Jim Cole

P.S. Hey Perry, was that Ice Racing comment a shot at our Northern weather?
 Just so you don't have to worry about getting your cars wet when you come
visit, 11/12 of our events were in the sunshine and about 80deg!  The
October event we got rained on.  Rats. (I also got totally blown away. Too
stiff!)
