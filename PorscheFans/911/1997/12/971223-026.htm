With my 86 Targa, it's not the socket is too shallow, it's that it's a larger
diameter than standard cig lighter sockets.  If you plug it in and it's very
loose, this is probably the case.  Cig lighter sockets aren't very deep in
general.  Most car audio, cellular phone shops have a small plastic ring that
you use over the plug before inserting.  It works fine here, although I notice
some vibrations will jar it loose.  I have a few things I've plugged into the
lighter and some work great with the adapter ring and others do not.

I asked about this at my local Porsche Dealer and they said that Porsche
doesn't think there is any problem.  You could replace the stock cig light
with a normal size one, or add one somewhere (I'm putting 2 under the driver
seat).

Oh and a side note...I have the Porsche air compressor that came with the car.
 It's plug is a larger size than standard and fits the larger cig lighter
socket perfectly.  :)

Happy Holidays,
