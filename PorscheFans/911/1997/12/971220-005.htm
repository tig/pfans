In Bruce Andersons' book, he talks about lowering the '75-'83 suspension =
to "Euro specs". I have made all the measurements and it looks like my =
75 911S is set up
with factory specs. I pulled the rear wheels and it appears that the =
adjusting bolts on the spring arm are in the lowest position...Do I need =
to rotate spring arm on torsion bar? The local alignment shop doesn't =
want to do it...Does anyone have any experience with this proceedure? =
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Sean=20

<<Hi folks,

I have achieved nirvana in the form of delivery of my new US '98 993 targa.  I
had just mentioned to my wife that I was lamenting the end of line of the air-
cooled 911 and she ran out the next day and ordered me this beauty.  Quite a
woman, I must say.>>

Vern:

If I were you I wouldn't worry about the new car but would keep a close eye on
the wife.  You sure don't want anything to happen to her

Ken Partymiller

PS  She have a twin or even a non-twin sister?
