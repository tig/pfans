I am in the process of looking for a 1978-81 911SC.  I am new to the 
Porsche world, but have found this list to be a great help.  I guess 
it's time to chime in and ask some questions.

1)  I will need to have the car I plan to buy checked out by a 
qualified mechanic, so what is a reasonable cost estimate for the 
pre-purchase inspection? (including compression and leakdown tests)

2)  If the car I buy does not have the Carrera tensioner upgrade, how 
much of my life savings will I have to forfeit to have this work done?

3)  I have been told that the electronics on these cars is "fragile."  
With that in mind, is there any risk involved with installing a 
non-factory alarm or stereo (incl. amp) in the car?

4)  Lastly, I haven't heard any rave reviews of German A/C units.  I 
saw an ad for the "ProCooler" (www.fastlane.net/~procool/) and am 
wondering if this is a good investment.  It gets pretty hot here in 
Dallas.


Sorry to drone on for so long, but any response would be greatly 
appreciated.  Special kudos to Ross for the "re-enlistment!"


Thank You,

Chris Jares
