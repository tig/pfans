Bob Williams asks:  Just curious to find out if other list members think it's
necessary to change valve cover gaskets every time you do valve
adjustment.  I end up doing this task about 3 times a year and many times
the old gaskets don't look too bad.  

Well, I reuse mine until they break when I take them off.  I am an
inveterate cheapskate, though, just to let you know the caution you
should apply if contemplating emulating my practices.  

However, if Bob checks his valve lash three times per year, he is much
more diligent than I, and probably suffers fewer disasters and sleeps
better at night too.  So perhaps he is less inclined to take risks.  I'm
perfectly willing to take a leaky cover off a month later if I miscalculated
and replace the slightly too used gasket and clean up the (not all that
major) small oily mess.  There are risks and there are risks.  It is not like
reusing rod bearings (never done it.  thought about it, though.  have a
large useless bag of them with obviously some life left).  But nobody is
paying me to do it right.

I think there are about 3 general kinds of these gaskets one might end up
with:  a slightly compressible graphite-like kind, a green hard kind, and a
kind (hard?) with some compressible coating dribbled on the surface. 
My experience is with the first kind.  I just put my first green ones on
(wondering how they seal because they don't look like they compress to
fill all the rugosities, although they did seal just fine), so I don't know
what their surfaces look like after use.  The last kind look like they are
designed for one time use.  Is this so?

The factory valve cover kit includes new nylock nuts and aluminum
crush washers also, along with the gaskets.  The crush washers last
through many changes if they are the right stuff and you don't over
tighten the nuts.  You know when they have had it because they crush
enough to be hard to get off (which is also the symptom after just one or
two uses if they weren't the right stuff to begin with).  A little galled, no
sweat.  Mushed out, toss them.  I have never seen a valve cover nut fall
off, and I reuse the nuts even when they almost spin on.

Would you want me working on your motor this way?  Probably not.  But
that's not what I do - I just try to keep my own stuff going.  So far I have
not suffered the indignity of blowing up an engine or otherwise doing
serious damage because I was too chintzy to spend .98 cents or
whatever on some small new part (or, as is apt to be the case, a dozen
such small and overpriced seeming parts) and reused an old one which
looked serviceable.  If you use a factory kit each time you have the valve
covers off you don't have to clean off any grunge from old gaskets and
nuts.  Since using new parts like these each time is inherently at least a
little bit better than reusing old, it may be a wash (as it were) when
paying to have things done, or if you value (or begrudge) your own time
spent on your beloved baby at mechanic rates.

However, enough from me - this is beginning to sound vaguely like the
car guys - psychology and not mechanics.  Others will doubtless share
more valuable insights with us, maybe even have quantified things:  if
squished to less than X, throw out.

Also, a suggestion on thinking about removing tranny with engine or not: 
Reading the views and experiences represented, I think it may be mainly
a question of confidence, which builds with experience.  If you do this
often enough, you will be confident in your ability to get the throwout fork
engaged properly and so on without a lot of screwing around (which
can use up all the time you saved pretty easily), and that you won't
somehow bend the input shaft during removal (which would be a real
disaster), etc.  If you don't have the inherent "if it is mechanical I can do
it, especially if someone else could" attitude some of us (unjustifiably,
sometimes) have as part of our personalities, taking a bit more time to
take the two out as a unit (as the factory says you should) has a lot
going for it in terms of peace of mind.  Besides, you can repack two of
your CVs as a bonus, and what could be more fun than that?
