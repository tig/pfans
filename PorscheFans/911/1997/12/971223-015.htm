I have the same noise and I consider it to be normal. I actually hear it as 
coming from the rear passenger side rather than the door sill area, where 
the oil tank is located.

I ran 36/44 on 16" rims and 36/36 on 17" rims. Lower pressure in the rear 
has been fingered, on this list, for leading to premature center wear on 
the rears. I don't mind a firm ride feel and never felt the 44 was too 
harsh for Chicago area highway driving.

> Finally, is a strut brace a good investment?

Depends on what return on investment you're interested in! On the track, 
and certainly on the street, without any other suspension mods or 
wheel/tire changes I doubt you'd be able to sense any difference in 
handling or performance with a brace. The stock C4 with 6" front wheels 
will understeer as you push it and you'll lose traction at the front before 
the supporting influence of a brace will be felt. You can improve the 
handling of the C4 with suspension and wheel/tire changes, and I'd suggest 
steps along that route, limited only by your budget, before bolting on a 
brace.
