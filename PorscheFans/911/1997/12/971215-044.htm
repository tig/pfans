It sounds like you are talking about Mark Hellner's car that was
featured in the Nov(?) Excellence.  The work was done by Rob King of
S-CAR-GO (415) 485-6026.  I met Mark Hellner at a recent timetrial
and decided to put a similar setup on my '97 Carrera 4S.  I'm pretty
happy with it.  Leaving these cars US stock is a mistake, they are 
just too soft and ride too high.

I also talked to Kevin Buckler at the Racer's Group 707-935-3999
and he tried to push me torward his kit which includes monoball stuts.
I recently tested one of these up HW121 for a few miles.  The ride
wasn't as hash as I had expected, but it really wanted to dance. IMO, a
little too much for the street.  I'm not sure that I would prefer 
this setup for the street.

You should call both of them and let them each argue their case.

The factory manuals had information about the Carrera RS sway bars.
They were 23mm/20mm, if I remember correctly, with 5 different settings
front and 3 different for the rear.  That might be something to 
consider.

If you are moving to 17" wheels because you want sticky tires, Hooiser
has announced their tire sizes for 1998 and they include 18" 275/35
18" 245/35 (I think those are the sizes).  I couldn't pin them done on
an exact date of availablity, so I opted for 17's.
