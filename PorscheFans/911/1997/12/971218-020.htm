     Has anyone seen (or better yet) used a towbar to pull a 911 or 914?
     A 914-list member bought up the subject and I've decided now that
     I need one to take car back and forth to welding shop and painter.
     
     
     If no one makes one, I'd be willing to design and do a limited run
     if list members want to get one.  I'm a Mechanical Engineer by trade
     and fortunately, my retired Master Machinist/Welder father is always
     looking for a good project or two.
     
     Not wanting to reinvent the wheel I'd much rather buy one.  It is 
     hard to beat the convenience of towing a Beetle or Ghia with the
     towbar slipping over the beam axle and completing hookup in 5 minutes.
     My goal would be to have a towbar (either design or buy) with that
     sort of convenience for the 911/914.
     
     Anyone seen one?
     
     Any interest in a custom designed unit?
     
     thanks
