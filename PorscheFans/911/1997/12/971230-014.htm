Juha,
     It was just a thought.  Another thought is this:  Is it only the gauge
going up, or can you detect a lot warmer engine when you put your hand on
it?  Maybe the temp. sender went south.
     I am the wrong person to ask about the thermostat, never messed with
one.  Maybe someone else knows?
