I have a set of HREs.  I wouldn't say that the Kinesis are "MUCH higher
quality" although they are very nice wheels.  HREs are custom made
for your car just like the Kinesis (at least mine were).  You give them the
offsets you want and they make the wheels specifically for you.  I have
the Fuchs style HREs, not the web style, but I can also add that they
are pretty light weight (about 19lbs each for my 17x9s and 17lbs each
for the 16x8s) - I doubt the Kinesis are much lighter although I would
be interested in hearing if they are.

My only negative thing about the HRE is that they made my front
wheels with the wrong offset (after I had specifically requested
a certain measurement) and now I have to use a spacer (they
did give me a 10% discount on the wheels, though as a result).

My couple of pfennig,
