Hi,

When I was visiting the dealer last week to get some parts, I said to 
the mechanic that I was surprised to see so many Boxter's standing in 
the showroom. He said look again , and indeed on second look  there 
they were standing the NEW 996's. From a distance an exact copy of the 
Boxter but once you get closer there is a distinct difference.

First impression, they are BIG. I could compare a 993 S with a standard 
996 (lined up nicely together) , and what a 'small' car is the 'old' 
993. Looks great from the side, but you will not be impressed if this 
cars overtakes you. The back looks almost a copy of the 928, but then 
without the Porsche lettering and big fenders. No aggressive looks 
here. (Must provide great business opportunities for the aftermarket boys !!!)

When opening the driver's door, I was impressed by the good looks 
inside. Far and far better than any picture I have seen !!!. Great 
driving position, and instruments are well clustered. Very modern looks 
and superb quality, especially in the car with the full leather option. 
However sitting in the front passenger seat, it suddenly no longer 
looks great, but rather chaotic. But who cares, it is all about being 
in the driving position or not.

Very small wing in the back, actually no longer required for cooling, 
just high speed stability only. Sound is very similar to the Boxter, 
not really 'screaming' anymore (although we did not rev it very high, 
new car you know). Nice gadgets such as the windows lowering themselves 
when you open the door, and up again when you close the door, back-up 
warning device if you go to close to an obstacle at the rear. (Looks 
like some Japanese guys had some input, but really do we want a sport 
car to be equipped with these gadgets ? No, I don't)

For the mechanics it must be a nightmare, can't see hardly the v-belt 
or alternator, it is really packed to the extreme.  Cooling system is 
meant to be sealed for live. So the 'do-it-yourselves' will have a 
serious problem in the future.

Overall beautiful car, for those who are looking for a refined 
sports-car. But the aggressive looks are gone.

Bye, Dirk
