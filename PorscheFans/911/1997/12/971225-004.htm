I wrote Kees Sanders individually at greater length, but this is to add
what I had not remembered when I responded to the list last time on this
thread.

There was a long stretch where the stock steering wheel had a
rectangular center pad in soft, molded plastic.  It does indeed snap off
at the corners, and the horn contacts are molded in (mine were
cracked--I use my horn a lot).  (I eventually got a Momo wheel, and the
air horn kit that Imparts sells.)

I did mention that the snaps were plastic and could crack.  What I
neglected to remember, and do now, is that the snaps themselves are
replaceable.  The female snaps are plastic and screwed to the
wheel--that's what's likely to break.  I'd arm myself with a set of
replacements, just in case, before pulling the pad.

I can sell the SO2's for less than tire rack prices. If you're anywhere near
San Diego I can mount and balance with the RIGHT equipment also. The equipment
is expensive, but you can't use anything else if you're working on nice
wheels.
