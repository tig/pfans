Scott,

I had a similar sound in my '85 911. It turned out to be some loose
screws holding the air box in place. This allowed air to be sucked 
in between the air box and the intake causing the whistling noise.
Even after tightening, it still makes a little whistle. My mechanic
attributes this to the K&N air filter. Hope this helps.
