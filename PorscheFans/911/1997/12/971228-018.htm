Dear Fans,

 Here are some tips that I have accumulated over the years working on
 930'S.

I. Engine

   If you are rebuilding your engine consider using RACEWARE studs and
billet
   washers & nuts. they are incredible and eliminate all problems with the
sealing
   of the cylinders at the head and at the crankcase. The dual plug of your
cylinder
   heads is great, even if you are on a tight budged you can use plugs on
the 
   bottom holes until you are ready to go to your ignition upgrade. I like
to use the 
   electromotive. As for cams I prefer the 964 specs, the torque curve is
great
   and the car will idle normally also they will pass a smog test. With
this cams
   we open up the intake ports and intake manifold to 41mm. As for injector
blocks
   I only use the aluminum ones. The air filter K & N period. The header
are one of
   the best thing you can do to your engine, I have only use B & B because
the
   are a good value for the money. One thing the pipe for the wastegate
will crack
   over time, we make a tab using the stud from the wastegate outlet
nearest to the
   engine and a lower valve cover studs. This vill save your header and
also the stock
   system as well. For turbos on cars up to 360 hp I like the K-27S it is
great and
   easy fit. On car over 360 hp I like POWERHAUS stage III turbo it will
blow away
   the K-29 every time. If you like the garret turbos you will have to get
a TS-04 from
   Turbonetics in O-TRIM with a .84 EURO housing. I like to use the V-BAND
they
   offer and all you have to do is weld a flange to your muffler. Do not
get a P-TRIM
   unless you want to change the flange on your header. If you do get a 1/2
billet
   and have a machinist to do your flange all you need is a garret turbine
inlet gasket
   to copy the flange. After you get your flange done cut off the old
flange and using
   a ball point hammer hit the corners of the headers to match the new
flange which
   will be little wider. Then you can use a P-TRIM turbo, we use the .70
turbine 
   housing and the performance is incredible. For mufflers we also like the
B & B
   single exit, the dual exit will be too loud to enjoy the car. If you
already have a dual
   exit weld a plate and drill a 1/2 hole. On intercoolers it is better to
go to the 
   longnecks, I have use garretson, kolken and B & B they all work fine but
we 
   always find that the mounting ears will need to be moved to fit each
car. The last
   thing is the air supply tube from the fuel distributor to the turbo
inlet is too                         restrictive. I use the parts off a C-2
turbo which are cheap and beat cutting a hole
   thru the fender and finding a new location for your CDI box.

II. Brakes
    
    The 928-S4 front calipers work great and are cheap, the rears we leave
alone 
    for street use and used pagid pads front & rear.

III. Clutch

    The aluminum clutch with a carbon kevlar disk is great.

IV. Air Conditioner 

     We use PERFORMANCE AIRE static condenser that fit under the car and
the
     vent kit under the dash and a 10" fan for the rear deck condenser.
This will give
     you a incredible performance and you will find yourself lowering the
fan speed
     and the temperature. This will also beat the PRO-COOLER system which
does
     work if you do not like to use the big static condenser under your
car. I use mine
     everyday and have no problems with clearances or anything. We see 
     temperatures over 90 degrees often and I this make the car so much
enjoyable.

V. Electrical bugs

    The fuel pump fuse will always fail beacuse it get so hot. We move the
wire from
    the bottom to the top of the fuse box. I use an empty space that has
constant
    power usually fuses number 4 or 5. This will bypass the fuse but will
get rid of 
    all problems with the fuel pumps. Use double ground straps between
gearbox
    and the body.

VI. Aerodynamics

    C-2 mirrors are great but Ruf and GT RACING sell block-off for the rain
gutters
    that work great. We also like the RUF PU front spoiler and the fit is
like the
    factory part plus it is very strong and forgiving if you hit it. If you
want to change
    the rear spoiler try M.A. SHAW parts they are the best finished for a
street car
    also change the lid you will save over 45 pounds off the rear. You will
loose the
    rear wiper but you can epoxy in some brakets for the rear deck
condenser.

I do hope to be of help to some of you guys, please feel free to e-mail me
at
pedrosah@tld.net . Mr. Lorenzo Gonzalez and I founded the 930 REGISTRY
and would be more than happy to share information about 930'S.

sincerely,


HECTOR PEDROSA
