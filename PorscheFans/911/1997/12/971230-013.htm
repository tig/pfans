All,

While at my local dealership getting an oil change last week I asked
my mechanic what he thought of a device that supplies power to the
DME and radio during those times when one must disconnect the battery.
You no doubt have seen this tool in countless automotive catalogs.
It consists of a plug that fits in the cigarette lighter with a
9 volt battery wired to the other end.

The mechanic told me that the factory discourages use of this product.
When I asked him for specific reasons why he couldn't come up with
a suitable answer.  Any ideas?  What could be the possible explanation
as to why this simple device could harm the electrical system?

I thought it was a sound concept to avoid entering in the security
code for the radio and all my AM/FM station presets.
