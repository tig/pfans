Margaret Gendron asked about "Pertronix" from gpr.  I tried the
Pertronix "ignitor" unit from Automotion.  I  also wanted to keep the
CD box and coil in my l975 911S Targa.  When the unit arrived, the directions did not describe that type of application.  So, my confidence
fizzled and I decided to pay good money to my local independent Porsche garage to install it for me.  The mechanic couldn't figure it out either, so he called Pertronix and got specific directions from them.  It didn't work.  I had Automotion send another unit.  It didn't work either.  With assurances from the customer service guy at Automotion, a third unit was sent directly to the Porshe garage.  It didn't work either, and I got to pay for all three installation attempts and for the reinstallation of my points!  Automotion says that they have a disclaimer and won't be reimbursing me for my out of pocket expense, but that they have been after Pertronix for an explanation.  It's been about three months. . . Anyone on
the list have any better luck with Pertronix?
