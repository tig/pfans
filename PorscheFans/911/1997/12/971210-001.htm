I replaced mine when the engine was out, but I was told that it can
be done with the engine in the car if you lower the rear of the engine
by loosening the rear motor mounts.  The same person that told me
they did this in the car has also replaced an airbox with the engine in
the car, so they must be somewhat masochistic....

I was completely unsuccessful in testing the valve with the engine in
the car.  I tried to eliminate everything else and then waited for an
opportune time to change it...

Good luck,

Reference Josh Lederman's question on Porsche's WWII History.

I assume that you've read "Ferry Porsche...Cars are My Life", which give's the
family account and Porsche "official" history.

If you want a general understanding (not Porsche related specific) of trials
for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, read "Justice at Nuremberg" by
Robert E. Conot which will give you some feeling for the era of denazification
process.   The entire transcripts of the Nuremberg Trials are also available
on the Web if you search.  See also "Mercedes in Peace and War- German
Automobile Workers, 1903-1945" by Bernard P. Bellon.

The term "collaborationism" in the wartime sense does not apply since the
subjects were German (or Austrian citizens) participating in conduct of
wartime business under the sponsorship of their quasi-elected government (you
can review in great detail how Hitler came to power and judge for yourself
whether it was through a "democratic" process...historians will forever argue
the specifics of the Weimar government and constitutional election and
appointment processes in effect at the time).

The last time we discussed this at the end of the Porschefiles list and start
of Porschefans it unfortunately generated a flamewar ("Ferry was a Nazi")
that, IMO, served no particular purpose and lost us some subscribers.

However, if you will accept the following from someone who has had the
opportunity to review the internal investigations of the US Army Europe in the
so-called "denazification" process subsequent to WWII, I will augment the
Porsche "official" history in Ferry's book with the following:

--Ferdinand Porsche was a apolitical and eccentric "genius" who throughout his
life used every avenue possible to advance his projects whether they were the
Volkswagen plant at Wolfsburg or the wildly impractical 189 ton "Maus"
supertank.

--Ferdinand Porsche, like most other recognized German Industrialists, was
subject to interrogation and investigation but never formally charged or tried
by the recognized Joint Allied Powers Commission.

--The exception was selected elements of the French government, who as after
WWI were determined that every avenue of reparations were to be extracted from
the defeated enemy.  In particular, these elements wanted to make sure that
the  wartime expropriation of industrial equipment, key managers, and workers
(many under a "voluntary" guise) from France to augment German wartime
production was harshly dealt with in retrospect.

--These elements were also concerned that competition from an emerging
Volkswagen in Europe could affect the peacetime reactivation of the French
automobile industry, particularly Renault and Peuguot.  Although there was no
American, and minimal British (temporary stewardship) long term interest in
the Wolfsburg plant, the French were both interested and covetous of the
facility.

--Aging and eccentric Ferdindand Porsche, as the father of Volkswagen and the
"Builder" of the Wolfsburg Werks was the chosen target.  If there was one, the
true "fly in the ointment" was not Ferdindand Porsche, but his daughter Louise
(Ferry's sister) and her husband Anton Piech (parents of Ferdinand Piech, the
current Chairman of VW-Audi and designer of the 911 engine).  Anton Piech was
the wartime manager of the Volkswagen Werks and as such responsible for daily
production and employment of workers.  The Piech's also enjoyed the benefits
of "hobnobbing" (to be generous) with high Nazi party officials.  (It should
be noted that middle and higher level executives of Mercedes-Benz, Siemens, IG
Farben, Adam Opel AG, Ford-Cologne, among hundreds of other recognized
companies, literally "bent over backwards"...or "frontwards" depending on some
of the unsavory characters of the Nazi-era leadership, to "enjoy" the
benefits... French wine, cognac, clothing, Cuban cigars, Dutch cheeses,
gasoline, etc.. that became increasingly rare for German citizens as a whole.)

--Ferdinand Porsche did "lobby" directly with Reichsfurher SS Heinrich Himmler
to add additional production capability to the Light Metal Works at Wolfsburg.
As occurred with many other German companies, many of these "workers" were
extracted from various concentration camps and came under the overall daily
supervision of the Plant Manager, Anton Piech.  Thus the underlying basis of
the deception, allegations of war crimes, and imprisonment that would follow.

--Under the shameful pretext of engaging in discussions on designing a new car
for Renault, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Piech were detained by the French.
Piech was subsequently released but Ferdinand Porsche was held and imprisoned
for 20 months without benefit of formal charges.   The French "official"
investigation was based on allegations that senior manager's of Peuguot (Now
you really know why Porsche was so sensitive in changing the public
designation of "901" to "911 in deference to Peuguot in 1963!) had been
"forced" to relocate to work in the Volkswagen Werkes at Wolfsbug, although
documentary evidence did not support forced relocation. 

--The joint Allied Commission should have demanded his release, but with one
of the Powers (France) the "culprit", the emergence of the Cold War removing
another (Soviet Union) and the United States and Britain focused on other
world priorities, this was a "small fry and old business" caught in the
turmoil of the period.    And as they say, the rest is history....
