Ok guys, my brother is contemplating selling his 911 in order
to increase his credit to purchase a house.  Here's a spec list:

1987 Porsche 911 Carrera
White/Burgandy leather interior(not a tear or scratch)
Completely stock
Power windows, sunroof, locks, drivers seat, mirrors
Stock Fuch's 16x5 and 16x7 black center wheels
Stock Blaupunkt tape deck
A/C (barely works...cool sometimes)
34,000 miles
Always garaged, never driven when roads were not clear or salty

The car was purchased two years ago from Northland Porsche at
19,000 miles.  PCNA included a 12 month unlimited mile warranty
at the time of purchase.  Agreed price on the car was $25,000
in October 1995.  The one previous owner was from Indiana.

Work done on the car so far:
30,000 mile checkup by Northland
Cam chain cover gasket replaced under warranty by Northland
Rear brake pads and sensors replaced by me(Repco non-metallic I think)
At the time of purchase, Northland claimed the front
brake pads were replaced.  Looked good when rears were
changed.

Problems:
intermittant wiper relay fails during heavy rains...wipers move constantly
drivers side door lock turns completely around(this part broke...was not
a forced entry)
storage buckets on doors are cracked where the top screw holds them
in(common)
rear speaker covers are cracked(common)

The above mechnical problems can be fixed before selling.

Any idea on price?  Blue book around Ohio shows it's
still around $25,000.  Similar cars in local ads show
the same, so that's probably what he'll be asking.  The
best way to sell it?

And yes, it was me who asked about getting the '87 930
before.  Sorry, but I made it a personal rule not to
buy cars from family after, well, my previous car was
totalled...was my other brother's before.  Even though
it wasn't my fault...it still expressed some hurt.

Unless anyone has any good ideas on how to remove the
car from his credit...two years and $13k left on the
loan.
