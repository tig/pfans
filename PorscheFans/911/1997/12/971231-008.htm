The offset you use will vary depending on how wide you want to go front and 
rear and which wheel design you choose. The offset together with the width 
lets you know how far the wheel/tire extends out past the front of the hub, 
under the fender, and how much is stuffed in back trying to rub on the 
inner fender when you turn lock to lock. Check out 
http://www.fikse.com/cad.html if you'd like a diagram of how offset plays 
into fitment.

Porsche issues occasional Technical Bulletins titled "Summer Tire/Wheel 
Rimm Summary" or "Winter Tire/Wheel Summary" that list "approved" wheel 
configurations. The only one I have is from 1993 (#9312) so your car isn't 
listed. But just for grins the 17" wheels for the Speedster were 8Jx17AH 
52mm offset for the front and 9.5Jx17AH 68mm offset for the rear. The 
Speedster also used a 17mm spacer. If you stayed with 8F/9R you would be at 
52mmF/55mmR.

Up through 1993 Porsche did not approve 18" wheels on the 964 series. I 
could never get a definitive word on why, or if that changed with the wide 
body in 1994.

You might visit a local dealer and ask the mechanics there for a peek at 
the Tech Bulletins for 1994 and 1995.

Also, I'd call the people at the wheel places, such as Fikse 
(206/248-1820), and ask them what they've sold for your configuration. You 
can check http://www.fikse.com/fitments.html and cross reference the Fikse 
part numbers to http://www.fikse.com/offsets.html but I didn't see anything 
there for 18" on a 964.
