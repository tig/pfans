Bonj listers,

Thanks to all for the replies concerning my latest leak adventure.  The 
concensus is that 911/912 type bodies tend to leak most through the 
windscreen rubber seal, and into the cabin rather than through the cabin 
deck or pedal mounts etc.  Catastrophic rust holes notwithstanding (!!) 
most replies mentioned window seals at one end or the other.

Any 911/912 rally drivers who can add to this?  They're always sloshing 
around in the snow, mud and rain!!  Your  info is  appreciated.

Bottom line-  try silicone sealant as a stop-gap, then eat a sandwich on 
the price of a new winscreen seal and have the screen out for 
rubber-renewal!!

Anyone had their car "waxoyled" (box section and underside rust 
inhibitor)?  I'm planning to, but would appreciate a comment or two on 
this seemingly sensible prevention step.  Seems most commonly available 
in the UK, the Italians scoff at the idea, although I know my local 
Porsche garage (Itri, Italy) will do more or less anything one can 
afford to pay for!!
