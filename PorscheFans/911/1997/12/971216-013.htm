Hi John,

First I'd like to say you are a lucky guy.  The lady let you buy a 2nd =
car with that as a reason?  As for your oil leak problem, it could b e a =
few things.  I'm writing you because I went through the same thing over =
the summer with my 73 Targa.  The 2.4 in the car has a magnesium case =
and the head studs have a tendency to pull out after time which in turn =
creates leaks in many areas including the tubes you mention.    The =
Studs should be checked.  That is usually the first place the motor =
starts to leak.  I had severe leaks that dripped on to my exchangers =
which in turn blew oil smoke in my face through the vents while driving, =
along with tube leaks and oil coming through the fan housing.  I was =
going to fix the problem but I ended up bending valves in a race with a =
Ferrari.  Needless to say I decided on a good replacement instead of =
repairing my motor.  I replace the motor with a 2.7 out of a newer =
vehicle and haven't looked back since.  have the motor checked by a =
mechanic or dealer.  Just have an estimate done.  It should only take a =
short visual inspection. Maybe 2 hours labour.  Don't however sign a =
blank work order even at a dealer.  I got stung by a so called reputable =
shop up here in Canada that way.  $1000.00 later I ended up with a =
completely diassembled moter and all I wanted was an estimate.   But =
back to the matter at hand I think this may be the underlying problem.  =
Good luck.....Let us know what it actually was.

Thanks
