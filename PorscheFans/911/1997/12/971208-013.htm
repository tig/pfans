The repair & re-paint of my T-boned 912 is almost finished.  Two things I
need to take care of:  1) install new windshield seal.  I got the seal on
the glass, now need to insert the aluminum strips in the groove.  Is soapy
water the best way to lubricate the situation, or is something else
preferable?  2)  I need a new/used radio antennae, mechanical I guess.  The
original, at least the one that was there when I bought the car, was a
fiberglass whip that was snapped off when my wife tried to do me a favor and
throw the car cover on it when bad weather unexpectedly came up one day.8^(
Tweeks has a manual for $130!!!  Seems a bit much, but I haven't found
anything locally that I think will fit the fender correctly.  Anyone know of
a more reasonable source, or have a used one in decent condition? Black
finish if I have a choice.  Thanks for any help.
