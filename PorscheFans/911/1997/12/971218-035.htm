Re Dave Kessler's question on echt Porche parts:  My no. 1 source
continues to be Stoddard in suburban Cleveland, whose prices are
competitive as dealers go (I once used their price on a clutch cable to
get the Monterey dealer to lower theirs).  They have virtually
everything in stock, not only hard parts but all sorts of restoration
items.  They're open late a couple of days a week for those not on
Eastern time.

If your order is over $25, request a 911 catalog--it has exploded views
of everything with part numbers.

They have some recommended aftermarket replacements also, like Permatune
CD boxes.

They're also reasonable on shipping--actual cost plus a modest handling
charge.

Even if it's only a decal you need, you can get that too (without having
to pay an automatic excessive S&H charge). For example, the 25th
anniversary decal, which I replaced in my car, cost $5 or so--it's been
repro'd, and they have it. An acquaintance had paid $75 at a swapmeet
for the same thing for his concours car.

And I wish they were paying me for this endorsement, but alas, they're
not. Phone is (800) 342-1414.
