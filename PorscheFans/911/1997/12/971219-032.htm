Cole,
    I have just completed having my case reworked. The 2.4 should hvae the
squirters already, but there are several things that are important. Have the
shop check the align bore to ensure that everything is straight, and within
spec. Mine had worn somewhat oblong. You might also want to have the mating
surfaces trued, this will make sure everything lines up and help prevent leaks
after assembly. 
    For modifications you may want to get the updated oil bypass. This will
reroute the oil to the pressure side of the pump rather than to the scavage
side which will reduce the strain on your oil pump. 
    I would also make a strong recommendation to have timecerts done for all
the cylinder studs, and for the internal stud near the main bearing. You might
not need it, but if you get it all back together and have a problem ....
    The only other thing I did was give the case a good cleaning, and then give
it a light coat of lubricant to prevent the magnesium from coroding.
    When you recieve the case from whoever does the work make sure you take the
time to clean out all the passages real well and blow them out with compressed
dry air. If not you run the risk of introducing contaminants directly to your
bering surfaces when you start the car. This could be unpleasent to say the
least.
    I should recieve mine any day now. I ended up using Competition Engineering
in CA. I will let you know how it goes.

          Hey everyone,

          I did some more snooping around the engine last night and
          heres what I found. The engine turns over no problem with e
          regular wrench I Icould hear no compression noises. I pulled
          the plugs and they were all very black and sooty. This
          s beginning to sound like a higher mileage engine to me so
          now I am moving towards a total rebuild rather than just a
          top end over haul. Yes Dirk's affliction is spreading and I
          have plenty of time to do this since the engine in the car
          is good. So when I split the case and send it to the
          machine shop what updates would you all suggest. I thinking
          piston squirters & carrera tensioners. Anything else you can
          think of. Bigger oil pump maybe? Also while I'm on the
          engine I pulled off the cam chain covers to have a look. The
          tensioners have not failed it all looks good. The chain
          gears look worn to me. Coming from the bike work if gear
          sprokets are pointy they are worn out. Does the same apply
          here?

          On induction systems what are peoples' thoughts for the 2.4.
          I had been thing of webers, but should I dissmiss the
          possibility of mechanical FI the engine came with. Is it
          possible to find all the parts for the FI to build the
          system and will it fit in a 914? Anyone done a conversion
          with mechanical FI. Also the price tag for all this stuff
          how do the systems compare. 1500-2000 for carbs what about
          porsche FI or even after market FI.

          Nick

          ps this a street car not race
