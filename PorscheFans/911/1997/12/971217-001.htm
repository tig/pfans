I saw the discussion about high-RPM pinging, especially under load. I have
an '82 911, and I've noticed that my car pings at around 3800 to 4200 RPM,
but only under maximum acceleration (floored) and especially if there is a
passenger in the car. Letting off the gas a bit (alternatively, telling the
passenger to kindly step out) when the pinging starts quickly resolves the
problem. The noise never occurs just revving the car when stopped, and
various fuels don't seem to make any difference. Now that winter has
started, I have not had the problem at all. I suspect that the colder/drier
air is somehow matching better with the fuel mixture, to allow better
combustion. How does that sound?
