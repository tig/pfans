To all:

Both the plate/clutch locking differentials and Quaife (Torson)induce
understeer. The clutch type LSD which is used in most Porsches offering
the option will give an immediate response to the steering in the form
of understeer because the plates are engaged. Most factory LSds have a
40% coupling factor in the clutch to facilitate cornering wheel speed
mismatch. Anything over 60% should e for a track application.

The Torson does not as it requires more torque to become effective,
meaning the understeer surge builds with the amount of power applied,
masking steering feel. This makes the Torson an easier unit to become
accusomed to. The Torson can be setup for a percentage of coupling to
match you application. These are precision gears with an interference
fit that requires power to be applied to make the interference increase
and thus lock (transmit power) to both wheels. The nature of the Torson
also makes it an ideal way to get a locking differential for a
front-wheel drive vehicle.

I'll argue that ANY LSD is desireable for track or autocross work. I've
always used one and they work. 

Now, legally cutting body roll and weight transfer from side to side is
a project that will yied more results.
