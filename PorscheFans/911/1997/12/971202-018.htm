Hi P-fans.

I haven't wrote in a while but I am in need of some body parts.  namely =
front end stuff.  The list goes as follows.=20

1988 or newer front fenders (911)
1988 or newer front hood (911)
1988 or newer hood latch strip.
1988 or newer front skirt/bumber/bracket
(the above could be new or used..please e-mail me with prices)

    I own a black 1973 911 Targa (turbo look) which I purchased used.  =
Yep I was the one who got ripped off by Mr Ludwig Heimrath & Heimrath =
Porsche Service back in September.  I have since found a very honest and =
reputable person to do my repairs and improvements in my area.  I had a =
newer 2.7 installed along with new clutch, seats, windshield, and some =
electrical parts.  I am now looking at replacing the front end with a =
newer look.  The car already has an aftermarket front end.  Well =
actually it looks like a home garage job.  Needless to say it's not a =
good job.  I want the car to have a clean look.=20
    I was also wondering if my headlight assembly will work in the newer =
fenders.   Since the assemblies look the same I figure they should work. =
 Any input would be greatly appreciated. =20
   On another note, the panel going over the car at the back of the =
targa roof has been painted black to match the rest of the car.  It is =
flaking off and the brushed metal is showing through.  I would like to =
get it powder coated for a good durable finish.  Does anybody know how =
easy it is to remove the panel. =20
please let me know. =20

Until next time, happy motoring,
