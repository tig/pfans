Steve,

Last months European Car had an article with the first phase of a resto
on an old Alfa.  The guy rented a blasting booth and then ordered some
kind of plastic media.  This media did not eat metal, just paint, bondo,
and rust.  He did the outside and inside of a shell in about a day for
the grand cost of about $100 for the booth and $200 for the media.  That
will save you the estimated 25 hrs. x $65=$1625.  But, before you blast
it, remove all the stuff you want removed like lights, glass, bumpers,
etc....  when you are finished blasting everything tow it the paint
shop.  With luck you can remove about half of their labor costs.  When
you get it back you will have to reassemble everything yourself.  This
self prep will also allow you to inspect your car throughout and notice
any areas that might have gotten eaten etc. and clean anything you feel
like cleaning.

I will be going this route with my '82 SC as I have counted 2 different
paint jobs and they are both cracking.  Not to mention all the chips.
No dents though!

Hey Fans,

Thanks to the cats living (temorarily) in my garage, the battery in my 911 is
stone cold dead.  All the glass is out of the car and one climbed in the car,
hitting the turn signal.  Don't worry, the cats will be gone by the time I get
my car back from the paint shop this winter.

Anyway, I need to charge the battery back up, if it isn't shot.  It's a 750
amp battery and I've got a 10 amp "automatic" charger I picked up at Sams.  I
know when I charge Nicad batteries I charge them 1.5 times their rating (ie a
1000mh battery would be charged with a 100mh charger for 15 hours).  Does this
work for car batteries, or should I just charge it for about 7.5 hours.  My
fear is not charging the battery enough, then cooking my alternator when I
start the car.

I'm going to disconnect the battery after I start the car for the month so
this doesn't happen again.

Anyone have any advice?

Thanks
John Helgesen
