One more method:

My standard cherry-picker engine hoist, the kind with two legs that sort
of come out in a "V" shape, is just the right size to wheel under a 911
with a 2 1/2 ton floor jack between the legs.  When the engine is lowered
by the jack it rests nicely on the legs of the hoist which can easily be
wheeled out leaving the jack beneath the car. If the  legs on the hoist
aren't high enough off the ground to clear the floor jack, just lay a 2x4
on each leg. The hoist then continues to act as a dolly.  It also leaves
the engine in perfect position for raising it onto an engine stand.

(I use a regular 4 arm stand.  The $50 variety.  I bolt to arm unit to the
crankcase while it is still on the dolly, and then raise the engine high
enough to slip the  arm unit into the stand.)

Happy New Year all!

Don, a few comments on your brake upgrade.

1) Buy the 930 master cylinder when you buy the brake calipers and 
discs.  If you just change the rotors/calipers, the Carrera master cylinder
will result in excessive pedal travel and a spongy pedal.  Changing the 
master cylinder at the same time will result in superlative braking feel
(from my experiences with my ex '84 factory Turbo-Look).  Might also 
recommend switching to the 930 vacuum boost unit.

2) You get what you pay for.  The calipers and brake booster are probably 
OK used, the rotors might be (could very well be warped; also, check the 
cross-drill holes; they start showing cracks after several heat cycles). The
master cylinder should ONLY be bought new.

3) I had a Carrera/930 parts list, but sold it when I sold my Turbo-Look. 
 Don't know all that's needed except probably need new steel lines from 
calipers to struts, new mounting hardware for calipers (I believe carrier 
plates that calipers mount to are different on 930 and Carrera), new 
brake proportioning valve (one out of later Turbo-look, or just remove 
totally by replacing total brake line - lift up fiber cover in trunk covering 
steering column and you'll see what I'm talking about).

4) Would be VERY worried about brake balance.

5) Should be able to; my Turbo-look had 930 brakes and 16" wheels fit.
if you intend to go to the "Big Reds" on the new Twin Turbos, then you 
will need 17" wheels, I'm pretty sure.

As far as braking feel, all I can say is that my old '84 Turbo-Look had the
best brakes of any car I've driven; I could go an entire weekend at a 
race track and the pedal always stayed firm and braking was suiperlative -
better than my present 993!.  

Exhaust vs. brakes???  Why are you doing this at all?  if you want to 
lower lap times, my opinion is that brakes can help far more than any 
exhaust change on a regular Carrera. 



I am considering a brake upgrade for my stock 86 Carrera.  I know very
little about this subject so I am open to all comments.  I want to upgrade
to, at least, 930 brakes.

1.  What is the best way to do this?
2.  Do I buy the parts new from someplace like Design, or should I look for
used parts in Pano?   If used, I'm not in a big hurry, so I can scan Pano
and other sources until I find the correct parts.
3.  Does anyone have a complete parts list of what is required?
4.  Will there be a big difference if I only upgrade the fronts?  ( I heard
this suggestion at a DE event)
5.  Can I use my stock 16" Fuchs if I use stock 930 rotors?

I have seen very little information about this type of upgrade in the
archives.  Is a conversion like this worth the $$ or is another upgrade
better to begin with?  (ie exhaust.)

Thanks in advance.
