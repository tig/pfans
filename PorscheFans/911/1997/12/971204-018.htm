Has anyone had experience with the Carrera Tensioner Upgrade in a 1968 2.0L 
engine?

I have seen conflicting opinions of whether this engine can be readily 
upgraded.  Some sources say that 69 and newer engines and some say 68 and 
newer for the upgrade.

Has anyone had experience with POR15 or similiar rust inhibiting paints?  My 
understanding is that this paint is applied directly over rust and it 
neutralizes the rust and then seals it with a hard coating.  It seems to be 
suited to floor pans, chassis and wheel wells.  It sounds too good to be 
true but technology does advance, so maybe it is as good as claimed.  Has 
anyone else tried it?  What is the long term success of this type of 
product?

Happy Motoring
