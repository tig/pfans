My 72T suffered from catastrophic tire failure (low speed, luckily) on
the way home from work yesterday and I'm now in the market for some new
tires.  I've got a few questions for the pfans pool of opinions and
knowledge:

1) The tires to be replaced are 215/60 Yokohama "Radial 388"s squeezed
onto 15X6 Fuchs rims (tires were there when I bought car as near
basket).  This seems to be too wide for the rims and there is definitely
some rubbing on inner wells up front.  I am thinking of either 205s
around or 185/195s on the front and 205's on the rear.  My question is
how the handling is affected by these treadwidth choices.  Will the 205s
around make the car oversteer more, all else being equal? 

2) Since I'm an infrequent novice autoxr I don't think getting R1s or
A032s makes much sense, though it is tempting.  Can anyone offer
testimony on BFG ZRs or Pirelli P700s (or another personal favorite) s
on this era 911?

Thanks much for any assistance.
