Happy Christmas everyone!


I wonder if anyone can help?

I seem to be getting a strange problem with my 1991 C2 (Tip) in that
sometimes, I am driving the car for about 10 minutes and all of a
sudden, the tachometer just stops and points to 0 revs! From that moment
it is completely dead.

I think a loose connection can be ruled out because the only way to get
it to work again is to switch off and on the engine again. Once this is
done, it seems to work fine till the next day. Does this sound serious?
Is it doing any damage driving the car like this??

Another thing is that on cold days the p-alarm looses sensitivity to the
remote control and on some days won't disarm unless the door is opened
with the key and I put the control really close to the alarm receiver
and PRESS!

Has anyopne else experienced this?
 

Many thanks
