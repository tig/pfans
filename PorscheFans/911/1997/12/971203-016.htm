Hi John, =


A very good change that the blower motor is history, but You might
be lucky. Here is what I did last winter: =


I cleaned & lubricated mine yesterday, very easy:
- Remove fan.
- Separate housing from motor assembly, 3 pcs nyloc nuts.
- Remove fan wheel, open the nut in center of fan wheel.
  This is somewhat tricky, as there is no key to hold the shaft =

  stationary, I just pushed the fan wheel against circlip.
- Remove the two Philips screws under fan wheel.
- Slide the two square nuts out from slots.
- Now the motor front plate can be separated from housing with =

  the rotor. Magnets are pretty strong.
- There are two circlips on rotor shaft, one round that keep the =

  fan wheel, and an other that hold the rotor in the front plate.
  After removing both of them the rotor can be separated from =

  the front plate.

When You have the fan in front of You, these notes make sense.

Now the bearings can be cleaned & lubricated, the front one has a =

felt around it to hold oil. I believe the bearings are sintered and so
porous and will retain oil. =


The commutator, the part where the brushes touch the rotor should =

not be touched unless burn marks. Normally the surface gets a patina =

and it should not be removed, just check that the grooves are clean.

Assembly is easy, if the fan wheel wobbles, just bend it carefully =

until it rotate straight.
