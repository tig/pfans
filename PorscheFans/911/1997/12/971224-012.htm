Seems like your tach problems, and some of the others are interelated.  =
The first thing that comes to mind is a poor ground serving the dash =
panel, or in your case possibly at the bus (looks like a fuse panel, and =
gangs the ground circuits).  Could also be at the bus (fuse panel) that =
serves 12V+ to these circuits.  Indications, when testing with VOM 12+ =
is indicated till you energize circuit (I.E. open door) then voltage =
drops.  The reason is resistance.  The circuit heats and acts like a =
inline resister.  The cause, corrodided connection.  You can prove this =
out by jumping a good ground and 12V+ to the item in question and =
observing the result.   Hope this helps you.

Seasons Greetings to ALL!
                                                                       =

Terry, about nine years ago I removed the upholstry and sprayed 3M Rust
Fighter-I on the inner body panels and in the truck lid drain holes of a '84
Jaguar XJS. There were a few place that had rust, I sanded these areas (where
I could get to them) and primed them with an rust inhibiter named  "Ospho".
Got it at a local hardware store. I've used this car as my daily driver and it
is parked out of doors (the 911 is in the garage). The body remains rust free
although it could sure use a coat of paint. 
Merry Christmas
