By Design out of Southern California seems to have pretty
good prices.  See their ads in Pano or Excellence.  I recently
needed to replace the front rotors on my Carrera 4S.  List was
$550 for a pair, the local dealer originally quoted me $430 and
got them done to $380.  By Design's price was $320.  Still not
cheap, but significantly less than list.  BTW, the "genuine Porsche"
rotors are actually Brembo's with the part numbers ground off.
