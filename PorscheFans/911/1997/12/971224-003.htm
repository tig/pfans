I am so elated about driving a normal running 911 that I had to sit down
and write this note.

My new (to me) 80 SC developed a sluggish idle problems a month or so
after I brought it home which appeared to be related to cooler
temperatures. The initial warm up period on cool mornings was tedious
for me trying to keep the idle up enough to keep the car from dying.
After the car warmed up it hummed right along at 900-1000 RPM and ran
just fine. When I bought the car in Houston it was 80 degrees and this
problem didn't show up until the cool weather arrived. Looking back
through the previous owners notes I now see where he was always fiddling
with the idle and warm up regulator during the winter and I bet this is
why.

Anyway, I got out my trusty factory manuals and other info and diagnosed
the problem as the warm up aux. air valve, the one that slides closed
after warm up. I based this on the manuals telling me there should be 33
ohms resistance in the heating element... mine was a dead short with no
resistance. 100 dollars later I found that the new one in fact did not
have any resistance either, oh well live and learn.

This weekend I set out to cure the oil leak from the oil pressure
sending unit located in the vary front of the engine, almost over the
transmission... the one that is next to impossible to get to. I removed
the AC and other wires and hoses and lowered the motor enough to wiggle
my hands back in there. After changing the sending unit I decided to
remove the round aux. air valve just for inspection. When I removed the
lower rubber hose I found quite a surprise... Someone had stuffed a
piece of cloth 1" wide by 10" long into this hose, I guess to plug it
off. I removed the cloth and put the car back together.

I knew that it would run different than before, but wasn't sure if it
would be better or worse. Lucky for me it now seems to now be running
properly. Someone was obviously trying to put a band aid on a CIS
problem... who knows why someone would do that. I did have to adjust the
idle a little. I just felt a need to tell someone, Thanks for listening.

PS - At the recommendation of a motor head I knew in Houston, I added a
bottle of snake oil that I bought from an infomercial (prolong) to my
transmission and I was utterly amazed at the difference it made. The
shifts require much less effort now.
