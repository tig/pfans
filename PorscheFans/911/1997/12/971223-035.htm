A month or so ago there was a thread about Barrier Motors in Bellevue and
their service policy of not putting Mobil 1 in cars brought in for routine
service.

I had my '97 911 C4S in today for a 7500 mile oil/lube/filter and some
warranty items (really the reason I went there), and when I picked it up, I
was shocked to discover that they'd put Quaker State in the car without even
giving me the option.  The service rep I was dealing with started making
noises about how it didn't really matter, they were the same, and besides,
the regular stuff was cheaper.  After ranting for a bit, he said 'well, Bud
Hoelscher in sales knows why we're doing this, let me go get Bud."  I've
known Bud for a number of years, and here's what he told me:

First, I should have been offered the choice, but the service rep screwed up
and didn't ask.  Apparently customers were complaining about two things--the
high cost of Mobil 1, and the fact that for the first 12K miles, they were
burning 1 quart per 500 miles in Mobil1.  Bud has implemented a
recommendation for his customers to run regular oil for 3-5K miles, and then
switch back to Mobil 1.  Why?  So the rings will seat more quickly and the
engine will stop burning (as much) oil.  Makes good sense to me, given the
known problem that the newer cars that only run Mobil 1 tend to burn oil
much longer than they should.

The service tech screwed up by not offering me the choice and by not
understanding why to switch to regular oil for the duration of one oil
change.

So, contrary to the thread going around, Barrier will install Mobil 1,
should be giving customers a choice, and might recommend regular oil for one
oil change to get the rings seated, and then switch back to Mobil 1.

Although I didn't buy my car there (their allocation was gone), I've had
good experience with their warranty service.  Given the relative
incompetence of their service front desk guys, I don't think they'll be
getting my regular service once I'm out of warranty.  They also tried to
sell me a lower engine cover ("Did you know that your lower cover was gone?
We can order one for $275...).  I passed, since the one in my garage works
just fine where it's parked.

Jim,

I hope your wheel damage is rectified to your satisfaction. Unfortunately, I
think you will find many many more sad wheel stories than happy ones. 

I've had several wheels damaged and scratched when new tires were put on. A
couple of years ago, after warnings, discussion, etc,, Dynan damaged a set of
M5 wheels.

Wheels are a no-win proposition for lots of folks-I think this is why P car
dealers stay away from them.  You need to find the right equipment and the
right personnel-not usual in a tire shop.

I'm sure we could get a long thread going about alloy wheel damage.
