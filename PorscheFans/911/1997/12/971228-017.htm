I wouldn't do a thing to the porsche if you plan to have the transport co
fix the car. Sounds like someone went for a joy ride. Could have messed up
the engine really bad. If it ran good when they got it then they will have
to fix it. Same for the paint.

As you are doing find the good shop arrrange for the transport co to pay
the bills and have the car fixed.

The largest TIRE that seems to fit an a '69 - '77
911 is a 225 or maybe 235 front or rear. The wheel width
is less important than the OFFSET. The standard factory
911 rims added extra width to the outside as they were widened
so even factory 7" rims may not fit the rear of an early 911.
They tend to work OK on the front but they will also fit on the rear
of some cars, especially if not lowered too much.

7" wide 911R offset wheels (or wheels with the same offset as stock 6"
wheels) should fit front and rear with 205 or 225 width tires.
Revolution makes 7 x 15" wheels that work great on the front and
OK on the rear (with 1/4" spacers) with 225/50/15 tires
on almost any early 911. They are heavy however.
You can even use 8" wheels
if you can get the right offset. The '86 944 optional
8 x 16" wheel (not only available on the turbo as most people
think) will fit on the front and maybe the rear of an early 911
if you tweek the fender lips and don't run too low or too soft.

I think the ultimate early 911 setup could be 7 x 17" wheels 
(993 wheels with thick spacers to get the right offset would 
look great) with 235/45/17 tires. Would be a tight fit!
