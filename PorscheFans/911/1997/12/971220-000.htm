Wow, if someone tried to charge me for 5.75 hours of labor to change pads,
bleed brakes, and remove engine undertrays, I would go through the roof. I
am sure I could do all of that in 2 hours without a lift.

The price of the pads seems out of line for Porterfields as well. If they
were Pagids you would pay that, but let's get real. It would seem you have
a reason to be pretty darn ticked off....
