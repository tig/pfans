Jim:

Your local dealer may or may not the right tire mounting equipment. I
(did) know of dealers that send out or subcontract their tire work.  You
must look for a shop (dealer or independent) that has light touch (not a
brand name) tire mounting equipment.  The ten or more fingers that grip
the inside of the wheel rim will have rubber on them instead of metal to
rim paint/metal grip (characterized by inch long serrations on the
inside of the rim).  All of the slip bars used to pry the tire bead over
the rim's outer edges will have thick white or clear vinyl padding on
the working surfaces.  Avoid shops that offer only metal to metal
contact equipment.

Lastly the equipment is only as good as the operator.  Talk to that
person to gauge his/her care factor.  A good shop understands and knows
that if you have a good experience that by word of mouth they will get
more business.

Lastly, expect to pay more than $5 to $8; a single tire mount with light
touch equipment on the east coast may run from $12 to $16, plus an
additional cost for dynamic spin balancing.

We fortunate in the Northern Virginia area that several independent
Porsche shops have this equipment.  Auto Sportsystem Group, "ASG," (the
shop I use) and AutoThority both have light touch tire mounting
equipment.  If someone is truly interested in the band name of the
equipment, I will call and get it.
