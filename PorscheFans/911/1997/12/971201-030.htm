Mike:

Ask Glenn if he remembers Thanksgiving weekend, 1987 at Laguna
Seca, before they modified the track by changing things between old
turns 2 and 4.  POC ran a joint event with PCA GGR Region, and Glenn
and I were there, in relatively competitive cars (Glenn had the yellow 911
at that time with the YPAF - "Yellow Porsches Are Fastest" license
plate).  I had been to Sears Point before that as a guest of GGR, and had
run a 2:02 my first and only time there in a pretty much stock '85 Carrera
Targa (winning my class, which was different than Glenn's) .  I had
come up there with my good friend Mike Mirell, who continued running
POC, and some GGR, events for years after that.  Glenn had the lap
record for his class at Sears at something like 1:58, so he was a good 4
seconds faster than me, I think mostly because he knew the track so
well and that was my first time there.

Anyway, at Laguna, I had pretty much been tooling around during the
weekend at about a 1:22, and Glenn was running 1:20 to 1:21, confident
that I wasn't much competition, reinforced by his advantage at Sears.  In
timed runs, he did a hell of a job and ran, if I recall, something like a
1:19.89 - an awesome time in a 911 on street tires on the old track.  Well,
somehow, I pulled something out of my butt and ran a 1:19.57, beating
him by about 1/4 second.  I think he was pretty pissed, in a friendly way. 
Great driver, though, and a nice guy, once I earned his respect.  Tell him I
said hello.
