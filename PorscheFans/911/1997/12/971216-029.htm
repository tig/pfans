I absolutely agree.  The first time I saw a profile on the cover of some
motor mag I squinted to see it and thought I was seeing the revival of
the 928.  It does seem that the new 911 is a move toward a more GT
style, like the 928, instead of a race car that just happens to also be
street legal.  I think the shape has become too rounded and bulboulous
(sp?) and I am not really taken by it.  It somehow reminds me of most of
the cars on the road these days and I am sorry to say I keep picturing
the new Ford Taurus EEWWW!   On gadgets, though, I do have severe gadget
lust and do not mind having things to play with in the cockpit when I am
sitting in the parking lot they call a freeway };)  I have a friend that
put a super nintendo in his old fire bird so his passengers could have
entertainment during the afternoon commute.

Still, if a new 911ended up in my stalking on x-mass morning I would be
hard pressed to get rid of it..... Then again it sure would make a nice
down payment for a new RUF CTR2 };)
