Hi Pfans,

To close the loop on the problem reported below, it was a warped front
rotor.  I had both front rotors resurfaced & everything is hunky-dory.
Thanks to all who responded.......Claude

I just acquired a '96 993 C4.  It now has ~5500 miles, of which I put on ~2500.

I've noticed the following problem when braking gently to a stop from say
30 mph or so:  Upon gentle application of the brake pedal, the steering
wheel oscillates (not vibrates) about (+/-) 3 to 5 degrees (about the
steering column axis) while the speed drops from ~30 to ~15 mph; then the
oscillation stops as the car further decelerates to a smooth stop.  I want
to also emphasize that this doesn't occur EVERY time I stop.  The fact that
it doesn't happen repeatably means (to me) that it isn't warped rotors; if
the rotors were warped, the objectionable behavior would be observed each
time I stop.

I think this could be a malfunction with the ABS or maybe the Automatic
Brake Differential (ABD) or maybe with the Dynamic Four-Wheel Drive.
Anybody seen this problem before?
