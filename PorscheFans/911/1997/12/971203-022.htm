Hi Ron,

I have an '84 carrera with a clock that works fine most of the time except
when the car sits in cold weather (below 40 F) for more than 8 hours.  Do
you or anyone else out there have any idea what the problem might be?  Is
this common for these cars like the fogging of the fuel gauge?  If I drive
my car during the day, and park it in the garage over night where the
temperature gets down into the 40's, by morning the clock has stopped.  If
I reset the clock, it works fine until I park it again that night.  Any
help would be appreciated.

Hi Robert:

I recently repaired the clock in a '69 911 which had two problems;
1) the delicate internal works were coated with gunk, very possibly the
same
film that forms on the inside windsheild from outgassing of the interior
vinyl. Only requires careful cleaning.
2) an fuse had "tripped." This fuse was designed in an interesting way in
that a spring loaded contact was soldered with tension on it. So if the
contact heats up to the solder melting point the contact breaks. The
contact
may have a special formulation or alloy of solder to melt at a particular
temp. I just used normal solder which melts @ ~ 158 degrees C if memory
serves me. Your replacement of the batteries may have caused a spike that
tripped the fuse.
The clock is much easier to work on than the other gauges because the back
is held by only screws and does not require removing the face plate like
the
other gauges.
