Henry:

    From the Automotion catalog:

        1965-66 engines can't update to the pressure-fed tensioners
        because the cam tower lines attach differently.

        1967 engines can update only after having the lold chain
        covers machined to accept the new oil inlet line to the
        tensioner.

        1967-72 engines must replace the upper two studs on the left
        cam housing with longer M8 x 60 studs.

        1968 engines with a smog pump must machine the left cam
        cover.

        For 1968-79 engines this is a bolt-on update.  1980-83
        engines need to drill and tap the new right-side chain cover
        for a lambda heat sensor.

        If old, narrow chain wheel supports are used [I WOULDN"T
        RECOMMEND THIS, BY THE WAY -AW], chain wheel support spacers
        are required.  If you're updating to the new chain wheel
        supports, spacers are not necessary.

    The kit from Automotion comes with new tensioners, chain covers,
    and oil lines.  You also need to buy a gasket set ($11), and
    since you have a 1967-73 engine, you also need a $10 adapter to
    properly locate the right cam-tower line.

    I have, but only for very small areas... They seem to work fine.
