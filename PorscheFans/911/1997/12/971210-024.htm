Tom,
    This is from memory so forgive me if it is not completely accurate.
    You will also need to machine the ports in the heads, and correct the fuel
pump to match. I am not shure if this also required new throttle bodies and
velocity stacks.
    The last thing is the T-engine used cast iron cylinders and fins and
pistons with a 7.5:1 compression ratio. The S used biral cylinders with 8.5:1
compression. I remember reading somewhere that Porsche had deemed the cast iron
cylinders were insuffiecient for use in engines over 150 HP, and I believe the
S was rated at 190 in '72.
    This should be mostly correct, hope it helps. FYI - new cyl&pistons $2K,
Pump $800, Head work aprox $1K, and ??? for throttle bodies. This will still
put it in the $4-5K if no other work is done.

Regards,

Has any one attempted to convert a 72 911T engine to  72-73 911S engine specs.
I looked in the factory manuals and the only difference I can spot is the
cams.  IS this true.  If someone could tell me whats all involved I would
really apperciate it.

Thanks
