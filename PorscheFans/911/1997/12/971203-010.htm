Hi Harley,

In response to my posting:

You're probably right about how the 'kinks' form.  The reason I put 'kinks'
in quotes both here, now,  and in my original posting, is because I know
they obviously aren't kinks in the usual sense of a looped and bent wire,
but rather in the sense of being little, abrupt changes in wire diameter,
caused perhaps by build-up of gas residues as you say, or maybe by storing
the car for long periods of time, thus allowing the float to stay in one
spot and developing a slight pinch in the wire.

But who cares?  They feel link 'kinks', and they act like 'kinks', and
feeling them with your fingers is a good diagnostic tool.

>Has anyone tried cleaning the wires?

Of course.  With lacquer thinner and all sorts of stuff.  The 'kinks' don't
really go away.  Oh, they may seem to.  But two tanks later and the float
will get hung up again.  BTDT.

>Finally, is the float at fault here? Without examining one I cannot

It's the 'kinks', not the float.
