Hi Again,

I have been monitoring the traffic in the chat room and have noticed =
that a lot of people are logging on at different times when there is =
nobody there.  I think we should start by posting a particular time to =
be on so we can actually have a few people on line at once instead of =
one at at time.  I would think the evening would be an optimum time.  =
perhaps a lunch hour.  I am located on the eastern time line
3 hours ahead of California.   Maybe we could meet at 8pm.  This way =
everyone would be off work and could be on line.  This is just a =
suggestion.  If you have an Idea, please by all means let me, or for =
that matter everyone here know what it is.

Thanks again
