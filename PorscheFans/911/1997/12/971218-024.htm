I had a 911/914 towbar that I pulled my racecar to the track for a couple 
years.  Basically, it was a yoke with the two sides set nearly as wide as 
the front caps for the T-Bars.  A L-shaped metal plate bolted to the 
bolts holding the cap on, and also to the yoke.  On the race car it 
required removing the front spoiler, but this may not be the case with 
early metal front valances.
