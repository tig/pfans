Rudy says he's looking at an '88 911 Carrera w/ 90k miles, and wants to
know what to expect.

I've got an '87 911 Targa, same car mechanically. Try to get a look at past
service records. If the owner doesn't have them, ask where the car has been
serviced. The shop will probably have a file, these days. If the owner
won't reveal the shop name, walk away, quickly and quietly.

At 90k, absent earlier maintenance, look to replace the clutch, brake pads
(and maybe rotors, too), and the shocks. Change the transmission oil, brake
fluid, and engine oil. Be sure to have the drive axle half-shafts checked
out, along with all wheel bearings.

A thorough pre-purchase inspection should also include a compression and
leak-down test on all cylinders. They should show within 5% of each other,
and at least 85-90% on leakdown, when the test is done (as it should be) on
a warm engine. The pre-purchase inspection should be done by a shop other
than the one that has serviced the car.

My '87 does not have power steering or ABS. I don't think the '88s had
either one.

Good luck!
