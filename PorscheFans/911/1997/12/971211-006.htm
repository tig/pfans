I've been battleing this myself, also an 86 targa though i don't think that
matters ;^)
First put your ear real close to the door when opening it and listen for the
plunger rod that moves the whole door lock up and down if that's working then
the problem lies with the end rod coupling. It's a little white plastic screw
on thingy that pops on like a knee knuckle. 
You can get the end piece for about .80 from the dealer, or they have the
entire rod now made outta plastic instead of the brass rod and plastic end
thing as a replacement on all the newer cars. 
If you do not hear the mechanism working then it's probably the motor it's
self. I've replaced this as well. 
It's pretty easy and in doing this you will have the opportunity to grease all
the working things inside your door that really need it. Like the window
slides, gears etc.
You can roll down the glass and look into the door and see what's going on
around the lock mechanism see if you can see a round little bit bigger than a
BB portion exposed that is where the rod/plastic thingy attaches.

Here's the procedure as I've done it probably 10 times in the last couple of
months......:^(
First remove the screw in the door top peice that houses the mirror adjustment
knob there's a philips screw in each end.
Remove the connector for the mirror now take off the bottom door shelf there's
about 5 phillips screws holding this on, 
now remove the the arm rest, there are two phillips screws holding this on. The
small round knob that locks the door is held on by a phillips screw under the
cap remove this by prying it up with a small screwdriver. Now remove the door
opener there's 2 allen heads behind the door lever and 2 high up on the door
unscrew the big round knob that's still holding on the door it's the part that
the cap was on. 
now simply and slowly pry the door skin off, slowly pry the window switches out
by the pair and if your careful you won't have to disconnect the wiring. But if
you do write down the sequence and the color of each. 
The door lock mechanism is located in the lower left corner and is held in by 2
8mm nuts and the wiring loom is held in with 1 brass screw in the very bottom
of the door. 

OK now here's the way i do it....... 
Remove the first screw on the top window rest lift it up past the door lock
indicator, remove the lower carpeted part and the arm rest bu tnot the door
lock round thing or the door opener part, the part with the 4 allen heads. You
can ease the door skin back now just enought to disconnect the lock mechanism
and un bolt it and insert the replacement part and while looking down into the
window see where the mechanism attaches to the lock mechanism.
Well, i gotta get back to work.....
Hope this helps, 
Denny
