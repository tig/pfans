I believe this is the case with many shops. When I wanted a good black
paint job and some bodywork done, I had shops that were not at all
interested in doing the work. I was going to be fussy, and there was no
insurance payment involved. My work was basically more like a minor
restoration and the shops don't feel they make enough money on pure
labor.
