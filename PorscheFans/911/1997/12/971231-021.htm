With engine and tranny out of my SC it is time to glue a new firewall
sound/heat insulator pad in place.  I have scrapped off most of the old
foam and glue (mainly stuff I sprayed in trying to get the disintegrating old
pad to stick for a few more years) with a putty knive.  My questions to
the List are:

Is the old glue which won't scrape off probably adhering sufficiently that
I can just apply new adhesive over it?  Or should I use my heat shrink
gun and other expedients to get things down to the paint?  

What is an appropriate adhesive to hold this foam pad in place?

My rough estimate (based on a sample of one) is that after about ten
years the foam on these pads starts breaking where it is glued, and they
start sagging.  Has anyone devised a feasible and better method of
attachment, as with mechanical attachments spaced throughout the more
vertical part (and not just at the edges as per the factory design), so the
weight of this thing is not all hanging from the foam?
