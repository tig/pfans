Hey there PFans,

Now that the list is back up to its normal levels and it seems to be
boiling over with knowledge I'm reposting this question about my clutch.


All those knowledgeable people out there, please help!!  Does any have a
good procedure for adjusting the clutch in an 85 911??  I put a new clutch
in my car this weekend and I am experiencing the following symptoms.
1) Clutch pedal is way easier to depress.  I greased up various things in
the linkage, etc when I installed the new clutch but the difference between
the new pedal feel and the old pedal feel is night and day.  Is this
normal??
2) With the clutch pedal depressed, it is still hard to shift.  Especially
the 1 to 2 shift.  Also, the clutch engagement is from the floor to only an
inch or two off the floor.  As I remember, the throw was much longer with
the old clutch (original one which had 125K miles on it).  Things I did to
arrive at this point were to screw the cable end at the pedal all the way
into the clevis.  Also I had to adjust the cable at the tranny end to so
that there is not that much adjustment left.  Otherwise the pdeal would
have been sitting only an inch or so off the floor.  Is there any trick to
lining up the splines on the release arm??
Does anyone have an adjustment procedure or know if there is an adjustment
procedure out in the Pfans archives??
I read the Haynes manual and the Porsche microfiche ones but they seem
cryptic to me.  I'm thinking of letting my mechanic take care of this for
me but I'd hate to be missing something that's easy to do.


Thanks for the help.
