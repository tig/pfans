I've heard of these symptoms for cars that have the Porsche alarm system. I
believe that it applies to at least 1989 (type 964) cars. There is an alarm
contact on the factory radio; it's there to cause the alarm to actuate if
the radio is pulled out. Apparantly you will get a battery draw if you
replace the factory radio and don't properly jumper the alarm contact.
Don't know anything about the the "silver cable".

Hope this helps,
