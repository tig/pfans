Jim,

I am sorry, but I don't buy this. The Quaife does not induce understeer. 
The reason? It never locks the rear end. In other words, the rear wheels
never are tied together. When turning, no slipage happens like it would
with a clutch-type differential. The process of overcoming the clutch-type
differential's lock-up when turning is exactly what causes additional
understeer that would not be present with an open differential or a
Quaife.

I don't know about other Torsen-style differentials, but there is no
adjustment in a Quaife. In fact, that would be counter the entire
principle. It applies the most power to the most loaded tire as long as
both tires are on the ground. If one tire gets up in the air (no load), it
will get ALL the power. There is no coupling so there is no "percentage of
coupling" to adjust. The "percentage of coupling" concept applies to a
clutch-type differential.

The 930 clutch-type differential in 915 tranny of my daily driver is set
at 80% lockup.  I have not experienced any problems with this.
