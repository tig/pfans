GREETINGS ALL, 
The laser pickup in my 89 Porsche radio no longer "sees the light". As a
result I need a replacement "PORSCHE CD2" radio. I know you can get new
radio for far less work, but like many of you I am a P-nut with too much
time on my hands. 

Since the drive is easy to swap out, a bad radio with a good CD drive would
help.

Thanks
Paul

Anyone's 993 have a steering bushing deteriorate, needing replacing at about
15k miles?  I understand it first causes the steering wheel to go more and
more off center and eventually, I don't know what happens.  One local 993
owner had it happen at 15k and now, at 30k, it is happening again.  Mine is
starting to go at 12k.  Porsche will fix it under warranty, but what about
later?  Any permanent fix?

Hi Everyone.
Hope you had a great holiday.....

               Just recently had my '83 911 (Targa) in the shop for
head stud replacements. And while it was in for this repair, I
decided to have the chain tensioner up-grade and a pop-off valve
installed.........ever since this repair and upgrades I have noticed
my baby now runs excessively rough, sputters and misses when
first started. After warmed up it runs like a bat-outa-h---. I am
scheduled to have the valves adjusted once I accumalate 900 miles.
Is there anything I should be asking  the mechanic, as to what has
caused this cold start problem ?           
           
                I am looking to replace my stock exhaust with a SSI
set-up. Any suggestions on "brand" to go with ?

Thanx,
          Zig
