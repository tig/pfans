Hello all, 

Hope everyone is having a nice holiday season.  A few quick questions
for you:

On my '80 Targa, when I raise my windows, they no longer stop at the top
of the fixed window, they go about 1/4 inch above that, which causes
probems with lining up the top of the window with the seal on the targa
top.  Anyone know how to adjust the height on the window?

When I took off the door panel, it seems that the driver's side window
is coming out of the track(that raises and lowers the window itself) so
when the window goes down, 1/2 way down it lifts out of that track.  Any
way to secure the window into the track again?  Should I use a glue, or
wedge it in with a piece of rubber?  

Also, the rubber nubs at the top corner of my fixed windows have worn
out, I purchased the replacements for them ($46/ea, ouch!!!), has anyone
ever changed these before?  I took a look at it and on the top of the
window, there are two screws, but on the side of the window, there are
what seem like small "pegs" that are holding the bracket in place.  Do
those pegs just pop out? 

The heat lever on my dash hasn't worked since I bought the car (about 8
months).  It's starting to get cold in the mornings here in San
Francisco, so I would like to connect it again.  What do I need to do?
The guy I bought the car from said it is just a pin under the dash that
connects to the lever.

Any suggestions for these problems would be greatly appreciated.

TIA
Scott
'80 SC Targa
