Been there, done that. The only difference with my car was that the damage was quite a
lot more. A lot has been said about the dreaded tensioners, but not too much about the
guide ramps. On the older 911s, the guide ramps were made of a type of HARD RUBBER -
NOT plastic. With age and heat, these become brittle and will eventually break. With a
collapsed tensioner, you might still be lucky and hear the noise of the chain slapping
around BEFORE it slips and detroys the engine. With a broken guide ramp you will NOT be
so lucky. The broken piece (especially if it is one of the bottom ramps) will jam
between the chain and cam sprocket or intermediate(lay) shaft gear causing the chain to
slip. This will not just cause the cam to become mistimed with the resultant damage to
valves, rockers etc, but can strip the teeth on the intermediate shaft gear. If it
happens at high RPM, the shaft itself can be damaged.  To repair this, you will need to
split the crankcase. This, believe me, is a MAJOR expense that will play havoc with
anybody's budget!
So, before you even THINK of going to the expense of upgrading to Carrera tensioners,
replace all the guide ramps with new ones (According to the local Porsche workshop they
are now no longer made of hard rubber, but of a nylon-like plastic that is much less
likely to break).
The snag is that this is a bitch of a job, not a simple operation like replacing
tensioners. The motor will proparbly have to come out, and the cams will have to be
re-timed - not a job for the feint hearted..
