I thought I could save some money by having an interface cable and an
Alpine 601 changer to my factory in-dash unit on my 1992 C2. This C2 has
the factory 8 speaker stereo with the factory amp under the seat, and a
battery run down problem ever since. First, from the right front tweeter
there is a morse code like sound with the volume up or down. It's, of
course, annoying and remains even with another 601 changer and new
Precision Interface cable (PIE- a place in Calif which makes cables to
interface factory units with name brand CD players. The other problem is
that the new battery goes dead after 5-6 days of rest.  Very frustrating
to jump in the Porsche on that one beautiful day on the weekend and no
battery.  One question which even the folks at PNA can't answer. At the
radio end there is a braided cable with a female coupling coming out of
the DIN type cable which attaches to the radio and which goes to the amp
under the seat. This braided cable is not attached to anything under the
dash and appears to have no end at the amp end. I doubt Porsche put a
cable with no purpose on their cars. Any ideas? Is this my culprit? If
anyone can help I would appreciate it. I have the radio, and the glove
box sitting on my car's seats and I have determined not to drive my
Porsche until my 2 problems are resolved. Thanks

George
