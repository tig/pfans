Hi P-fans.

A few days back, I mentioned that I was planning to put up a web site =
where people from this mailing list could get together and chat about =
repairs, experiences etc.=20

Well the site is up!.  It's called the Porsche Fans Lounge.  I have set =
up a test site for now.  The site is done in frames.  The chat room is =
up and running.  The room is linked up with another room for now so ther =
is traffic there.  I will be demerging the room in 1 weeks time.  The =
chat program is pretty versatile.  You can change your text color, =
include a picture.  The refresh rate is quick and is easy to use.  The =
e-mailer and main page are also up.  The links page needs some =
additional links, if you want yours put there e-mail me with it.  The =
archives, and pictures pages have to be set up.  I do have to make some =
finishing touches though.  Please check it out, make any suggestions.  =
Hopefully We can make this site a place to get together to socialize and =
have a good time.  Here is the  URL

http://www.globalserve.net/~dragyn/pfans =20

I look forward to your input

Thank you.
