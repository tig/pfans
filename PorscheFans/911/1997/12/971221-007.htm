Hey Walt:
	Since you have been kind enough to provide some advice on my clutch
selection I though I would impose upon you for some advice on my engine
removal project.
	I am well into this project and have disconnected a host of lines,
fittings, and such.  However, my Haynes says to plug the fuel lines after
they have been disconnected and I have no idea what to use (I recall old VW
days when a pencil or golf tee got jammed into the fuel line to plug it
up...seems a little crude for this project).
	So:
	What do you suggest I use when I disconnect the filter and accumulator?
	And, can I expect fuel under pressure to come spewing out of any of these
fittings?  I have this unpleasant vision of a major conflagration in my
garage, with the inevitable explanation to my spouse and insurance
agent--and to those who think I am a pretty good wrench and could not
imagine me screwing up like that.
	And, finally, when you put it all back together do you use anything on the
threads to avoid leaks?

	Your help will be greatly appreciated.
(and I also recall your ability to get the engine/tranny assembly out in
less than 4 hours, or was it 1, and I am genuinely impressed.  Granted I am
being methodical, since there is no rush, but I have 3 hours into this
already and am not close to dropping the whole thing down onto my engine cart)
