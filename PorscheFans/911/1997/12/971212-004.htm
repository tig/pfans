Dr. Porsche designed a turret for the Tiger I and later the 'King' Tiger  and I think
the 'Maus'. I think some of the King's were built but it was late in the war. The Maus
was too big and I don't think was ever in production, just prototypes.  The Tiger turret
was considered too complicated and only a few were built.

I have also read that Porsche designed the Lepoard tank that NATO uses but I don't
have a reference. 

At least in the late 80's Porsche was doing about 50% of their research work for other
companies. I think Dr. Bott claimed 20-something different designs in production on 
non-Porsche vehicles that they were responsible for.
