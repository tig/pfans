Nick Cole asked about special tools required to rebuild his 2.4T, other
than a standard wrenches and a good torque wrench. A few come to mind.

1) You'll need to find a way to get the cam nuts off the cams.  There are
two special tools; one holds the cam, the other is a large crow's foot for
the nut.  You can also get by with just a big socket, 1 13/16", I think,
but you better measure to be sure.  You can both loosen and tighten the
nuts working against the chain.  Purists will gasp.  You'll stretch the
chain!  But you won't.  I don't think even King Kong is strong enough to
actually stretch the double link timing chains.

2) You might want to have a wooden or aluminum rod of the right diameter to
tap out the wristpins.

3) I find it real useful to have a small slide hammer to help get the
rocker shafts out. You can make one pretty easily.  The shafts tend to
stick in the cam housing, and it can be awkward trying to tap them out with
a screwdriver.  Maybe someone else has a better idea.

4) You'll need an appropriate set of hex wrenches to undo the gizmos that
hold the rocker shafts in.  I think one is 8mm, the other 6mm, but check.
For the larger one, I bought a simple 'L' shaped hex wrench and shortened
the shorter side so that it would fit in the available space.  For the
smaller hex wrench it's real nice to have a short, stubby unit that fits on
a 1/4" drive.  If you can't find one -- Snap-on has them--you can always
make do with a cut down hex wrench.  All this will be much clearer when you
look at what needs to be undone.

5) It's nice to have something to hold the timing chains so they don't come
off the layshaft sprockets as you rotate the crank while installing the
piston rings and cylinders.  If they come off the sprockets it's a royal
pain trying to get them back on, although it can be done.  I think Porsche
sells a special device for this, but you can easily fashion a makeshift
arrangement.

6) You'll need the type of ring compressor that can be completely 'undone',
or opened up, as it will be pushed down by the cylinders and wind up around
the piston rod.  You need to be able to open it up to remove it.

I think that's about it.  You'll need a depth gauge for setting the valve
timing, and if you do the rebuild right, you'll want to set the offset of
the timing chain sprockets which requires a depth gauge.  You can also just
be careful to replace the shims that you remove.

Have fun.
