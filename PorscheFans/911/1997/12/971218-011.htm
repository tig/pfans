I'll defer that one to someone with more first hand experience.

Depends on the climate where you live. The controls are confusing at 
first but once you understand them, you have much more control over 
heat, fresh air, and where it goes than in a normal car. The system's 
capacity to heat and cool is limited but unless you live in Alaska or 
Death Valley you shouldn't be too concerned. I live in Florida and I 
know that the PO of my '88 fought an ongoing battle to make the A/C 
colder with limited success. I don't think I'll have any problem 
living with it the way it is (I didn't move to Florida to be cold 
:-).

> 3.  Can this be an "everyday" car?  I drive about 80-100 miles a day.

Mine is. I have a shorter commute (about 40 miles/day) and it is 
about 80% Interstate and 20% small city driving. Lots of heavy 
traffic stop-and-go driving can get tiring but that's the case in 
just about any sports car.
