Thanks to everyone who replied to my message about my car and it's 
mystery pull to the left.

Some of the suggestions for the cause were:
	
	sticking brake caliper
	the crown in the road
	incorrect corner weight
	swap tyres over
	check for type pressures, loose components etc

Just about everybody discounted a faulty shock or torsion bar.

I've checked out the caliper and it's just fine. Type pressures are 
in line, fronts 32, rears 36. Components all seem to be secured but 
my guess is that if one were loose, I'd know about it by now! I also 
put another set of wheels on and the problem persisted. I ran the car 
at the local shopping centre to confirm it's not the crown in the 
road.

That leaves me with what I believe is an incorrectly weighted car. 
My initial investigation to measure ride heights shows up the 
left front to be higher than the right.

 LF is 26 3/16 (665mm)   RF is 25 13/16 (655mm)

 LR is 25 3/8 (645mm)    RR is 25 3/16 (640mm)

Front shocks are Boge, rear  Bilsten.

Looking at the shocks, I think I've found a problem or two.

The left shock has the following codes on it
	911 341 041 03
	1 0211 32 132 0  (this is partly obscured by the outer casing of the 
shock)  
The right has
	911 341 342 00
	1 0211 32 474 C (the outer casing is at least 1/2 an inch above the 
codes).

So, it seems to me that I have two different shocks on the front 
of the car, and if the stamping is at a consistent height, the left, 
with the higher ride height, is sitting with the shock more 
compressed.

Hopefully someone with a much greater understanding of these things 
can let me know what exactly it is that i have stumbled across, and 
whether it could be the cause of my pull to the left.

thanks
