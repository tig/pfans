    Correct, Walt... For reasons which I'll explain below.

    Usually, it's because a "dead" battery isn't really dead at
    all... It just can't produce enough energy to turn the (hugely
    current-hungry) starter motor.

    It isn't reverse-bias voltage that damages the diodes; what
    typically happens is this:

        1.  Your car's battery is too low to crank the starter, so 
            you jump-start (or [push-start) it.

        2.  The instant the motor catches, you jump in and rev the
            engine up to 3000 RPM or so, "to charge the battery". 

        3.  Since the battery's very low, it asks the alternator to
            supply a LOT of charging current (like 75 amps or so),
            and the poor alternator -- because you're revving the
            motor so high -- actually TRIES to supply that much
            current.

        4.  The huge surge of current through the alternator diodes 
            fries them.

    To avoid this problem, NEVER rev the motor just after
    jump-starting it; let it idle for a few minutes, instead.  The
    battery will still ask for lots of current, but at idle speeds,
    the alternator won't be able to supply it and your diodes will
    survive.
