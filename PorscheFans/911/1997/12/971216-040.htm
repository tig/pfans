Thanks Walt,

I may or may not be impressive in aerospace software, my knowledge of
batteries and alternators dates back to undergraduate studies.

In circuit design, we usually model a battery as a "perfect" voltage source
with a series resistance (I think that's the Thevenin equivalent).  The
more current, the more voltage lost to that resistance.  At any rate, a
common car battery with no load should always have 12 volts across it's
terminals.  That should be enough to give a reference voltage to your
alternator's voltage regulator, and the battery's internal resistance will
always do its part.

In other word, it should be perfectly safe to push start an alternator
equipped car as long as a battery of some sort is installed.  I used to do
it with a 1974 Land-Rover.


If an alternator should go wildly over its design voltage (14 Volts or so
in nominally 12 Volt cars), the diodes which convert AC to DC will fail to
hold back the extra voltage, and they could be damaged by the strong
reverse current.  Generators have no diodes, so they can't burn them out.


I quite from the lower right hand corner of the early 911 factory wiring
diagram"

"IMPORTANT

Disconnecting of battery with running engine results in immediate
destruction of alternator."
