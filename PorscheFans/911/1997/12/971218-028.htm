Well, 

I went and got the tranny oil replaced by clean new redline, and I am
glad I did not attempt that one myself !  Getting the oil out is easy,
but getting it back in is another story, the mechanic had to find a pump
somewhere..anyway... It shifts essentially the same, maybe a tad better
but that might be psychological !  There wasn't any "out of the
ordinary" metalllic residue on the magnetic plug. 

The noise is still there, under 2000 RPM... It really sounds to me like
the noise my Fiancee's car was making when something on the exhaust was
vibrating on another piece of metal, it's hard to tell exactly where it
comes from (rear area, but..). I couldn't see anything rubbing when the
car was on the jacks, so unless one of you comes up with a brilliant
idea, I'll just drive it until it breaks...;-) 

Thanks !
