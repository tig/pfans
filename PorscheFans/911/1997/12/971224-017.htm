Ron, the 911 is a superb 2+2 (although my 15 year old 5'6" (and growing)
son has been unsuccessful in getting his 5'2" mother to sit in the back
when all of us go on the road). My only complaint is that the air
conditioning is a bit weak (especially when going from San Diego to Las
Vegas with all 4 of us and luggage).

The Targa has a bit more head room for the rear passengers (mine is a
1980 911SC Targa). Targas do have more wind noise that the coupe, but
less than the cabriolets.

If you can afford it, the 911SC series can be extremely reliable. Mine
has over 210,000 miles on the original engine. I have heard of some with
over 350,000. Like buying a house, buy the most expensive one you can.
The nice things about 911's is that the newer model years are always
better than the previous ones. One word of advice, avoid the 1976 &
earlier 911S. Because of the smog control system placement (thermal
reactors) and other things, their engine life tends to be ~75,000 miles.
The 911SC's are MUCH better cars (Carreras are even nicer).

Oddly enough, if you have a good driving recond, the insurance isn't too
bad. I am paying $560/year.

Another advantage to a 911 is that your children don't mind being seen
with their parents (if said parent is driving the Porsche. On the other
hand, a high school freshman being picked up by Dad in a Honda is, well
you can imagine <g>).

Final comments. Get Bruce Anderson's Performance Handbook (2nd edition).
It will tell you much about Porsches.

2nd. GET A PREPURCHASE EVALUATION! Ask the list for recommendations for
mechanics in your local area.

3rd. see #2 above

4th. Join Porsche Club of America and then go to the local region's
driving school. Even if you and your wife don't intend on racing,
knowing how this vehicle handles will at the least give you more
enjoyment and may save your life when some idiot spins out in fromt of
you on the freeway.

Best of luck,
