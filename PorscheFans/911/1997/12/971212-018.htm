This is not over...

No one said that, Winders implied that I said it. In any event, I had
thought that a MacPherson strut was a coil spring over a shock absorber so
that the spring and damper would have co-axial axes of motion. If this is
not the case, I stand corrected.

This may also be possible due to the coaxially oriented shock-spring. Is
the axis of action of the torsion bar in the 911 coaxial to the shock? This
would explain a lot.

Yeah, and this is like saying that Kimberly-Clark didn't invent the tissue.
I recall reading about the early days of the VW bug development where
Porsche went through all sorts of problems with exploding bars until the
metallurgy was worked out, so I assumed he broke first ground. Sure,
"torsional springs" were not invented by Porsche--the question is--if
Porsche was not the first with an automotive application, who was?
