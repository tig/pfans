Hello all,
I have been pretty busy lately and haven't been able to post for a
while, but here I am!  I think my E-mail has been messed up by my
computer lately, as when I send E-mail it posts the return address as my
old AOL account.  The proper address to respond to is:
bebbmi@comsource.net
All of the upgrades that I did to the 930 turned out great.  The car
runs very strong and is a blast to drive.  A little loud @ 70mph with
the new headers and exhaust though.  Anyway, to my tach problems.  The
following problem happens most often when the car is cold, and gets
better as it warms up, but never disappears.  When my rpm gets to 1200
the tach will "jump" up to 4 or 5,000 rpm and then come to rest at 0. 
If I push the clutch all the way to the floor or hit the brake pedal it
will come back to life (usually at idle) and then when I hit 1200 rpm it
does the same thing again.  It will even "die" when I am in neutral and
rev the engine, but if I turn on the turn signals the tach will jump
everytime the turn light clicks on.  A precursor to this "dying" used to
be that my "fasten seatbelt" light would come on and the door buzzer
would sound before the tach died.  Well, I disconnected the "fasten
belt" and "park brake" light at the circuit board behind the lights and
it still did the same thing.  So, I removed the relay for the door
buzzer.  Still does the same thing.  I am at a loss.  Is it the tach
that is the problem?  Is it the wiring in the car?  It's driving me nuts
and I would like to get it fixed over Christmas.  Any advice is
appreciated.
