Hi... I am back from a long gone (sound like 6 months). anyway, I 
brought a 911SC 82' (black) with a very good condition and it has 110, 
000 on it. I got it for 16,500. 
     my adventure began the first night I got it, I ran out of gas (the 
gas gaged is wrong). then as soon as I put a new gas in, it had no power 
at all??? even the 2nd gear it was runbled. and it sounded lounder and 
had a white smoke.  so I took it to the shop and let them see what wrong 
with it. yesterday the machanic said that it need tune up, the 3ed vaule 
is broken, need new worm-up recurator, and new oil filter. all of that 
are 649$. but there are some more to fix (the dealer have to pay) water 
leak, heater, right door lock, antenna. 
   many times I feel like I can not have it no more, it will take all my 
money and all of my time. but I feel great when the mecahnic says "it is 
a pretty good car"  now it will be with me.
    I am 18 year old and came form thailand to study (in tacoma, WA). i 
study here for a year now and took a bus all the time before the 911 
come to my life. I don't like any other car except the porsche so for a 
year I save my money and buy noting and not eat outside (worth it).
     I would like to talk more but the time is running out, so here 
comes the point.  are there any tricks to park (save from the carjacker) 
and what is the best car alarm I should get for this "wonderful."???? 
and where???   please some advise.. I don't want to lose this "art."

best regards,
Jap
