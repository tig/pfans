Bill, you may have noticed Fred Schwierske's posting on the Dunlop D40
M2
[I'm quite pleased with their performance on my Porsche 930.  Are they
being obsoleted???] and Dunlop's response [From:

>     The Dunlop SP Sport D40 M2 will be discontinued as of January 1, 1998.]

I just bought a pair from The Tire Rack. The price was great -- $83 each
and fast delivery. I'd jump on the phone and order them. The fact that
they're being discontinued just decreases the impact on your
wallet/credit card.

Vern, I'd say keep the wife for as long as you can. It may be possible
to replace even a Porsche, but this woman sounds irreplacable! <g>
