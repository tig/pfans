Well, its been a while. My '73S Targa has been resting in a body shop
for the last couple of months.  Not sure what to do with the car.  The
body shop first gave me an estimate of $5500 to do a complete paint job.

The shop is reputable and a father and son operation.  Now the son says
his dad has a sharper eye and says the estimate is now $11,500 and that
he just wasn't thorough enough.  I've already pulled almost all rubber
and trim off the car.  The estimate includes pulling both fenders,
doors, bumpers, trunk and engine lid.

They estimate 25 hours to strip the car to metal.  Is this accurate? 
Seems high to me as other estimates I got were 15 hours.  Is this really
needed?  The car has been repainted (cheaply) once and the paint is
starting to flake off in some areas.

The estimate does not include pulling the windshields or replacing the
rubber/trim.  It also doesn't include things like pulling the parking
and tail lights.  

All other reputable shops in my area have given rough quotes of $8500. 
I have a feeling that if they got as detailed as the current shop my car
is at that those estimates would climb into the 5 digits also.

Any suggestions?  Never thought it would cost this much!
