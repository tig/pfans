I am replacing one of my heat exchangers on the 1971 T that I purchased
recently.  I had to order a special tool from Porsche to remove the
flange nuts.  No big deal.  My question is how tight do I install the
flange nuts and allen nuts when replacing the heat exchanger.  I don't
think I will be able to get a torque wrench in there so a general idea
would be appreciated.  I <bold>DO NOT </bold>want to risk breaking any
studs.  


Also, I purchased a Bursch SteelPack muffler.  I noticed that the stock
muffler had two bands that supported it.  The Bursch did not come with
any and the salesperson who sold it to me said I only needed to attach
the four bolts that hold the muffler to the heat exchangers and that
would suffice.  I am a little skeptical of this.  Obviously the stock
muffler was better supported and I am a little worried about the entire
weight of the muffler basically hanging off of the ends of the heat
exchangers.  Is this going to put too much stress on my heat exchangers
and rip them out.  If anyone has experience with the Bursch steelpak, I
would appreciate any comments.


Thanks in advance for any comments.
