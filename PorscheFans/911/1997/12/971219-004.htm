I would like to give my .02 worth about The before mentioned company.
David, my contact there has always been helpful and he has helped with the
returning of an item as well.
I suspect that there was an error on the addressing part. 
As always used parts are subjective to each person as to the condition. 
No affiliation just a happy customer of a couple of years. 
Sounds like to me UPS didn't care about the condition of the seat as much as
you and 
installed it in one of their trucks......
