Saw mention of align boring the crank case.  If you have this done, have
the machinist leave the bore for the #8 bearing (if I have my count right -
it is the big fat one piece one right at the flywheel pully) alone.  Generally
there is nothing wrong with this bore.  It is way out at the end, only gets
non-reciprocating loads, etc, etc.  Of course, if it measures wrong, that's
different.  Main bearing sets do not include this bearing, because it
usually doesn't need to be replaced.  And it is expensive.  However, a
first oversize #8 is REALLY expensive.  Machinists typically just run their
align boring tool through all the bores, but they do not have to do it this
way.

CE claims they can align bore and get the case back to standard.  Would
be a good thing to investigate.  Standard case side bearings are usually
less expensive than first oversize.
