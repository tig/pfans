Good morning Pfans, 


This morning was a cold one, and for the first time, my 911 surrounded
me in a could of smoke at the first stop light. Not when I started it,
but when I put it in neutral at the first stop light, 200 yards
thereafter. I had never seen it smoke that much, it was doing a good job
of concelaing my car, a tank commander would have been proud of me. 

By curiosity I opened the window, but could not smell anything bad like
massive oil burn....It was lot of smoke for condensation, but it looked
like it...  As soon as I was in first gear, it never smoked again, and
then it was warm, and it never smokes when warm...  Is that "Normal(tm)"
? 

Item #2 : I noticed 2 wires hanging next to the exhaust pipe this
morning. Didn't have time to track them down, or rather up !  Any idea
what they are for ? Whatever it is they are not doing it 'cause they are
cleanly cut !  

I have an idiot's guide and a bentley manual for my Ghia, which are
quite sufficient. Is there such a thing for a 911 ? (the stock manuals
are as you know, very expensive)... Is Up-fixing a good enough source,
BTW ? I was thinking of buying the one that matches my car's year....  

Thanks again ! 

Greg. 83 SC
