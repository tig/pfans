     Hello Pfans:
     
     Yesterday my wife was driving our 78 911 SC.  She called me, at work, 
     and told me the car was burning lots of oil (and the oil level gauge 
     reading was jumping around).  I informed her that the gauge is 
     worthless.  I treat it like an idiot light considering its accuracy.
     I had her check the dip stick and it said that there was plenty.  She 
     drove it a little more and the smoke went away.  Later, in the 
     evening, while I was driving it started pushing out lots of smoke.  It 
     seemed to last for 5 to 10 seconds after each stop at an intersection. 
     Then it cleared up.
     
     It was dusk, but I'd say the smoke was light in color, but the smell 
     wasn't that heavy of oil.  So I don't want to limit the things I 
     should check out.
     
     Oh mighty gurus of the little German wundercar, please share your 
     infinite wisdom with this unworthy one.
     
     And Merry Christmas to all!
