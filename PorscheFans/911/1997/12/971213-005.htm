First it's senior citizens leaving the turn signals on--now it's cats.  
The menace grows.

NiCad batteries have a lot of quirks like "memory" and (potentially)
thermal runaway.  Lead-acid car batteries are much lower tech, and don't
need much special care.

As far as frying the alternator, don't worry.  The battery acts as either a
load or [possibly] a voltage reference.  It can accomplish either without
being nearly fully charged.  As long as the battery can start the car,
you're safe.

A more sensitive human would send his cats to kitty driver's education.

I should give my credentials:  I'm an electrical engineer, although
batteries are a LONG way from my specialty (aerospace systems and
software).  My academic background is pretty strong on alternators.  I
would start MY alternator-equipped cars as soon as the battery could turn
the car over.

I'm also not a cat owner.
