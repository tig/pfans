     Subj: re:90 C2 Warning Lights
          
     Hello,
          
     I would be very interested to hear if anyone else has had this 
     problem. My 90 C4 just started doing the same thing. All of the 
     warning lights will blink for a moment and then go off. It acted       
     like Melissa's once where I had to shut the car off and restart. The 
     car seems to run fine when this problem occurs. I have heard what I 
     believe to be a clicking noise from under the dash like a relay or 
     perhaps electrical arching. Is it possible that the ignition switch is 
     going bad. Any help would be appreciated.
          
     Thanks,

     Subject: 90 C2 Warning lights Question
          
     Hello,
          
     I've owned my 1990 C2 Cabriolet for a whole month now, so I hardly
     qualify as an experienced Porsche owner.
          
     As I was driving to work today, my beloved car suddenly started 
     beeping at me, and all the warning lights on the dashboard were on.  
     Oh my!
     Anyway, I pulled over, stopped the car, stopped shaking, and restarted
     the car, and everything seemed fine -- no warning lights or beeping.  
     I got to work without further incident.
     Does anyone know what could have caused this?  Is it a glitch in '90
     C2's, or is it something I should get checked out immediately?
          
     Thanks in advance for your help.
