I have a '91 C4, basically the same car with respect to engine/electronics. 
The car should idle rock steady under the control of a variety of sensors 
and the DME computer. My car may hunt a bit after a cold start in the 
winter, for about 45 seconds, as the warm-up circuit fiddles with the 
mixture, but otherwise ... dead smooth.

There was a thread a long time ago with a question from Don Schmidek 
<dis@metricom.com> where he asked Subject: 911 C-2 starting
	I have a '91 C-2 which does not like to fire up on the first try,

He then went on to offer the following interesting tidbit of 964 lore:

     In poking thru the Maintenance manuals I found a very interesting
     section which addresses the diagnostics capabilities of 964 (1991 911
     and on) system.  Anyway, if you step on the gas pedal (engine/ignition 
     OFF), and then turn the ignition on - do not start the car - you will
     notice that the "engine check" light in the instrument panel flashes
     within 3 seconds. Release gas pedal and note the flash pattern.  The
     flash pattern, can be translated to a diagnostic message.

     A long light-on cycle followed by:

     1.   One short - pause - five short ones = System OK - no faults
     2.   Short-pause-short(1)-pause-two short(2)-pause-four(4) 
          short=oxygen sensor (1_24_)
     3.   1_11 Supply voltage
     4.   1_12 Idle speed contact ground short
     5.   1_15 Idle speed contact break
     6.   1_13 Full load contact short to ground
     7.   1_14 Engine temp sensor
     8.   1_21 Air flow sensor
     9.   1_22 Idle speed control
     10.  1_23 Oxygen regulation stop
     11.  1_24 Oxygen sensor
     12.  1_25 Air temp sensor (NTC 1)
     13.  1_31 Knock sensor I
     14.  1_32 Knock sensor II
     15.  1_33 Control unit (timing retarded)
     16.  1_34 Hall signal
     17.  1_41 Control unit faulty
     18.  1_43 Tank venting valve
     19.  1_44 Resonance plate fault code
     20.  1_45 Check engine warning lamp fault
     21.  1_51 - 56  Injection valve - cyl 1 --> cyl 6

On my car I get the 1-5, all is OK, message. I'd be concerned about the 
experience of the place where you bought the car.

Cheers,
-Ez Goldman
'91 Carrera 4

PS - anyone know what #16, a Hall signal, refers to?
PPS - a bit more bandwidth won't hurt at this point, so: Happy Holidays to 
everyone!
