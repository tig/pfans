Has ANYONE ordered a New 996.  I am currently a Boxster Owner (996
"knock off").  My wife is interested in the 996 (HOORAY!!) and I am
hopeful.

I would like to hear what people are being told about the 996 by
dealers.  I went throught the  BOXSTER "ordering ordeal" ! The 996 will
like be the same!

Are there any 996 sights on the net?

Thanks,

John Felker

Keith and Velma-
Try Crutchfield. While it may in fact be true that there is not a radio that
dimensionally fits your opening, Crutchfield often includes installation kits
with all their car stereos that can mask/hide/cover an ill-fitting
installation to give a professional appearance. Their technical help people
should be able to tell you what is involved and what options are available to
you. I don't have their number, however Crutchfield heavily advertises a "free
catalog" in numerous magazines so you should be able to locate them easily.

<I own a 73 911T, recently my OEM Blaupunkt stereo went dead.  I have
checked the fuse and the radio is getting 12VDC.  I have looked into
replacing this, as the radio did not sound very good even when it worked,
but there does not seem to be a radio on the market which will fit into the
dash holes.  I hate to cut up my dash to install a newer style radio.  Is
there any ideas out there, or should I be content with the sound of a flat
six?>
