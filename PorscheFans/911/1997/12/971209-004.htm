Hi Porsche-fans,

It is possible that you've seen this E-mail before, but I have not
received the digest-mail due to a email-problem.

I currently own a great 1985 carrera 3.2. However I'm planning om buying
a 1989-1991 C2/C4 soon. Now there's plenty off stuff to read about the
specs of C2/C4 however I would like to know what possible drawbacks 
might be..

Are there recorded problems with these early C2/C4's, why are there so
many early C4's for sale ? How much more expensive is it to maintain/
repair a C4 in comparison with a C2 ? How much 'slower' does a C4
actually perform ?

Is it possible to buy a convertible and actually leave it outside all 
year without it leaking (I live in the Netherlands)?

I hope you can help me with some answers..

Kind regards

Marc van Vossen
