"Clunk" could be something as simple as loose front insert.  On my car (72 911 
with Konis) the insert (that's what some call the shock 'cause it fits inside 
the strut tube) is screwed in via threads on the top of the strut tube.  These 
can loosen (its happened to me).  If one does, you will get a clunk that 
behaves as you describe.

Good luck,

Subject: 	Front suspension

I was examining my front suspension yesterday and I noticed that one of my
tie rod ends was very loose.  As the car has 154K on it I am going to
assume that my suspension components are fairly worn out.  Should I replace
my tie rod ends and the ball joints, just the tie rod ends, or just the
ball joints?  Also, has anybody else ever noticed their cars making a
clumping sound when going over a speed bump?  Mine does.  It sounds like
something is loose, but I don't know what it could be.  It is coming
primarily from the right side of my car, whereas the loose tie rod is on
the left side of my car.  What are the typical suspension repairs that
should be made to a car as old as mine in order to restore proper handling
capabilities?
