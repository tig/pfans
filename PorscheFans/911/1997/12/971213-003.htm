I thought smoking on deceleration was a sign of worn valve guides?  Anyway,
I'd also guess the temp. related part of it is due to oil viscosity changes as
it warms up.

Just guessing....

Well, you guys were right about the battery charger.  After about 5 hours the
charger clicked off and went into trickle mode.  My battery is now charged and
disconnected so it won't get drained again.

Thanks guys
