Southern Cal Pfans

Looking for anyone on the list who has had paint work or knows of
someone who has had painting done by Porsha Klassik West in Huntington
Beach.  The owner is Craig Stevenson.  He advertises in the Porsche
Market Letter.  Lists 356 Carrera and Early 911S's as his specialty.

I spoke to him about my $11,500 estimate here to paint my '73S Targa. 
Says he can do a show quality job for anywhere from 3k to around 6k.
I'd like to check references first before I decide to drive the car from
SF to Huntington Beach though.

Thanks
Steve

     Any ideas on what could be my cars problem.  While cruising on the
freeway today at around 80 mph. my car shuddered, (felt like when you start to
run out of gas) and experienced a slight loss of power.  After pulling off the
freeway it now idles around 500 rpm (instead of 900rpm) and lopes or surges.
No smoke or weird noises.  The car is a 82 SC 95,000 miles just had a major
done around 200 miles ago.  I plan to call the shop on Monday but was
wondering if any of you out there have any thoughts.

Thanks
Glen 82 SC
