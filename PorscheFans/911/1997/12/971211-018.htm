Hi All:

    Beware of the bad business practice of a Pro-Cooler company.    I
had order their Pro-cooler unit for my 76' 911S, the first unit came
defected.  The owner said he was more than happy to replace the defected
unit.  However I had send in for replacement since August and now it's
December.  Moreover, Pro-cooler has seem to be out of business.  My
attempts to contact the company by email and telephone had all failed.
I believed I had made enough effort to contact the company, therefore my
intention here is not to "bad mouth" anyone.  The unit seems to have a
good idea, however, I never had a chance to try it out!  At this point a
replacement unit would be ideal, since I had already made all new hoses
for such fitment.  If anyone have any information, please email me
directly. jlplee@gte.net


Sincerely,

Jason Lee
