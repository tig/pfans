Bryan,

You=27ll need a large floor jack to get the end of the car high enough.  =
In fact, the only reason to use jack stands in front is so the body work =
doesn=27t touch the ground when you have the rear in the air.  Jack the =
front up first and when you=27re done lower the front last.

The first time I did this, I found that my jack stands in the back were =
not long enough to use the torsion tube as the point of contact to the =
car.  I ended up with the jack stands (very carefully) contacting the =
floor pan just in front of the torsion tube.  I didn=27t discover this =
problem until I had the engine out and lowered on the floor jack.   I had =
removed the air filters but not the Webers.  With the floor jack at its =
lowest, the top of the Webers was about 1 =BD inch too high to clear the =
lower edge of the body work.

I quickly made two =22T=22 shaped wood stands about 24=22 long out of 2x10 =
pine.  I rested the engine on these so I could get my floor jack free to =
raise the car some more.=20

Don=27t forget to park the car so you do not have to drag the floor jack =
with the engine on it across any expansion joints, particularly when the =
jack is still under the car.

Good Luck,

Bill Betts
