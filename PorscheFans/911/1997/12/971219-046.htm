I have just purchased a 1985 911 targa and have to buy new tires for it.  I
was hoping that I could get some advice on what to get.  I don't have to
drive it everyday.  I do drive it about 3x a week and try not to get caught
in the rain.  I need a good tire because I want to go to PCA's driver
education classes to learn how to drive my car.  There could also be racing
in the future ( I bicycle race now and love it).  I have been looking at
Michelin Piolt sx mxx3 and also Pirelli Asimmetrico.  Any advice or
experences would be great.  Thank you very much
