The 7" round Hella H-4 replacement light should have a light pattern nearly
identical to the Bosch-made Porsche specific H-4 light units.  Because of
the bigger reflector, either H-4 could be better than the unit with two H-1
bulbs.

However, Chris, if you are getting flashed by oncoming traffic when you use
your low beams, you may very well have badly aimed headlights.  These
headlights have a very sharp beam cutoff: the low beams should put LESS
light into oncoming drivers' eyes than sealed-beam headlights.  The sharp
beam pattern also makes them easy to aim.

Please aim your lights Chris.  Some friends of mine [that's it, friends of
mine--I'm almost sure that I would never do such a thing myself] have
well-aimed 55/100 Watt headlights and don't want any crackdowns.

 Fans,
 
 Just as soon as I get one thing fixed, up pops something else.
 
 I tried to do my usual starting of my 911 to circulate the oil this morning
(and to check if my battery has the juice) but when I hit the starter it
wouldn't disengage.  I turned the ignition off and it kept turning.  I tried
turning the key a few times, but it kept turning.  So I jumped out, grabbed a
socket and pulled the negative cable off the battery.  I put the cable back on
after a while and the starter was not turning now.  Put the key in and turned
it, and the starter cranked and stopped when I turned the ignition off.
 
 Any suggestions, selinoid bad on the starter, bad ignition switch maybe?
 
 Thanks for any advice,
 
 John Helgesen

Hi all porsche fans!

My husband just purchased a 1972 911t coupe.  I am the computer nut, thus the
reason for me writing instead of him.

We are interested in finding
 
1. a fuel pump for 1973-74 fuel injected engine 2.4L
2. a 1972 911t coupe back rubber window seal and bumper rubber seals front and
back bumpers and a front bottom bumper piece.
3. electric antannae 
4. 74   5 speed transmission
5. Good set of tires (corvette type, I think)
6. and a 1972 911t whale tail 

Also some manuals for the 911t.  

Look forward in a reply

Linda

Fans-
	
	I'm pulling the trans out of my '71T to either rebuild or replace it. I've
come across several used or rebuilt units from different years, specifically
'68 and '69. I know the clutch size is different, will the '71 clutch mate to
the older trans? Any other accommodations (axles, linkage, clutch cable,
mounts) that must be made? Thanks in advance. Todsimpson@aol.com
