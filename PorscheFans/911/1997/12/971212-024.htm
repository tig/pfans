Since Stan was curious about the C2 warning lights, I thought others
might be interested in the helpful responses I'd received.
Thanks to all who replied to me with some great advice!

Possible causes:

1.  Something in the brake system may have lost pressure.  Check your
brake fluid level/system.

2.  The ABS system in the car is extremely sensitive, computer driven,
and constantly
adjusts itself to optimize its performance.  Therefore, if you have
recently changed tires, wheels, or brake pads this
could be a possible cause.

3.  A noise suppresser on one of the spark plug leads may be defective,
allowing lots of noise into the car's
electrical system.  If this is the cause, replacing the spark lead and
noise suppresser will fix the problem.

4.  A problem with a wiring harness that has a BIG interconnect on it..
it gets a bit loose or something.. maybe
condensation?? 

Thanks again to those who replied to me.  This list is a great place to
go to get questions answered.

As far as my car goes, I haven't had this problem since.  My brake fluid
reservoir is full, so I don't think it's the brake system.  I have
changed the tires on the back within the last month, but they're the
same size as previous.  However, they're 245/45, which is bigger than
stock, but I'm not sure if that would cause this anomaly.  But then
again, I hardly qualify as a Porsche mechanic.  ;-)  Between meeting a
deadline at work and having the flu, I haven't had this problem looked
into.  If it happened more frequently, I imagine it would become a much
higher priority.
