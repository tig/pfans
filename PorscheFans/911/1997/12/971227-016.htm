>> I have been looking at wheels and I was wondering if you compared the Kinesis mesh wheel vs. HRE's?  On a lowered 930 with 17" rims, how is the ride?>>

Randy,
I would say that the Kinesis are of MUCH higher quality than the HRE's. 
From what I know about HRE they are more of a mass-produced rim, where
the Kinesis are custom made specifically for your car.  No spacers
needed.  The ride on my car is pretty rough, but I would attribute that
to the lowering and the 40 series tires, not the rims.  If I were you I
would definitely give Kinesis a call.  They are expensive, but well
worth the money.  They are perfectly balanced and look great.  Not many
people have them either.  Everyone at the last PCA event I went to loved
them. 
   
>> Adjustable boost systems sound interesting, I have though a lot about a system like that but I wonder when would I want less boost ;-)   This does bring up an interesting question,  when does a car have too much boost?>>

I wouldn't worry about a gauge for cylinder temp, I would just use the
rule that I have heard from many other 930 owners, which is: NEVER go
above 1.1 bar of boost unless you have some serious internal upgrades to
your car.  If your car is totally stock (exhaust etc.) I wouldn't go
above 1 bar.
 
>> Sounds like this would really reduce spool time on the old turbo.  Did you make these upgrades one at a time and observe performance differences for each upgrade?>>

Unfortunately I did most everything (exhaust, clutch, brakes, trans) at
the same time, so I can't really tell if one thing or another added more
power.  The exhaust did make the car much more driveable though.
 
>> I have read several articles that discuss the merits of different types of material for brake lines, are the SS lines DOT approved?  Did the pedal feel change vs. the stock lines?>>

As far as I know the SS lines are DOT approved.  The pedal feel was
firmed up quite a bit, and I would say that for the money it is a good
upgrade.  Of course, since I got new pads and rotors it's kind of hard
to say if the SS lines helped braking or if it's just in my head.  I
wanted them so I guess I can think they helped.          =)
 
>> I've seen the adds for Nology's spark plug wires but haven't seen anything about their design or construction.  Do they interfere with the radio?>>

The wires did ot interfere at all with my radio, although it's hard to
hear any music above the roar of my exhaust and wastegate!  I did
receive an E-mail from another P-Fan (Sam Sigarto) who recommended that
I check out Magnecor's web site: The web site is
http://www.magnecor.com/        He had these wires on his Porsche and
was very satisfied.
 
>> Sounds like you have been very busy with your 930 this fall.  What's in store for '98?  Turbo or maybe an intercooler?>>

I think the next thing I do will be a RUF front spoiler and probably a
better intercooler.  My checkbook needs a rest though!
