Pfans:
Anybody had any (preferably positive) experience with inner panel
corrosion inhibitors other than Zbart.  Seems that if you go to the
trouble of rust removal and repair there should be a way to keep it that
way.  I've used ACF-50 on aircraft which looks like hydraulic fluid but
its a repeat process that makes a mess and I don't think it would be
effective in a car.  TIA and wishing everybody a happy holiday.

Terry:

The problem with any oily corrosion protection is that is addresses only
half of the problem.  Corrosion is an electro-chemical process.  There are
two basic stategies for protecting steel:  1) prevent entry of oxygen
(sealants), and; 2) inhibit the chemical process (passivation).  Sealants
slow the process, but cannot stop it.  Passivation combined with a sealant
will work for a very long time.  New cars are much more corrosion
resistant, because the factories all do a better job keeping the steel
passivated.

For an older car, you can to the same thing the factory does.  First remove
all the loose rust.  A scraper is good.  A wire brush is better.  A power
brush is best.  Sand blasting is best, but tends to ripple sheet metal, and
ruins hinges, locks, and other mechanical parts.  I don't recommend it for
car bodies.

All the cleaning processes activate the steel, which makes it more likely
to corrode further.  Passivation is required to make the surface better
accept protective coatings.  Paint shops sell products with names like
"Metal Prep", and "Metal Treat".  Naval Jelly works as well, but is a
little messier to clean off.  After the passivation treatment, do not sand
or scrape any more - you will activate the surface again.

For exterior surfaces, follow the finishing steps of one of the better
paint suppliers.  I have used DuPont's Imron, Chronar, and ChromaBase
systems on different cars, including some rusty ones.  The only rust
failures I experienced were in places where rust was lurking under what
looked like sound paint.  Remember, it is a system, and you must follow all
the instructions for good results.  All the better systems require
passivation and a rust-inhibiting primer before the top coats.

For interior body cavities, like the inside of doors, I spray a cold
galvanizing compound.  CRC and Rustoleum both sell a good one.  Galvanizing
is a layer of zinc, which corrodes more easily than steel.  It essentially
grabs all the available oxygen before the steel can.  Build up several
layers for best results.  A minimum dry film thinkness of 0.001 inches is
needed.  0.003 to 0.006 inches is best.  Too thick and you risk peeling. 
You put a sealant on top of the cold galvanizing compound, and you have
protection that lasts a very long time - two or three years at the sea
coast, and decades in a milder environment.

Finally, keep the water drains clear, and remove debris which collects if
the car is parked outdoors.  Rotting leaves are acidic, and will eventually
eat away anything you use for corrosion protection.
