Hi George,

> I have a 92 C2 with a battery draw down problem. The culprit is the
> small fan located at the rear of the Heater A/C unit.  The fan stays on

I purchased a (working) used unit from a shop called Studio 911 - the owner
is a friend of a friend. Phone numbers are:

514-955-7853 (Montreal)
802-285-6666 (Vermont)

Ask for Bruce.

As I mentioned in a previous email to you, I have exactly the same problem
that you describe with your car, and replacing the heater unit DID NOT
solve the problem. My local shop also spent some time trying to diagnose the
fault, including swapping my heater unit with another (working) one from
another car - this also DID NOT solve the problem...

It's interesting that you still get a current draw with the fan unplugged...
I haven't put mine on a meter yet, but my battery certainly doesn't drain
with the fan unplugged.

My suspicion is that one of the relays in the fuse box is bad...

Cheers,

Ross
