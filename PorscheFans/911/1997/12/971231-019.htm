Jon Rodriguez has replaced his SC headers with better aftermarket
ones, and finds these interfere with the overly long and poorly protected
factory oil line which runs from the front left bottom of his engine case
(the oil pump scavenge output) back to the rear of the engine, across to
the right side under everything, and then all the way frontwards again to
the external oil temperature thermostat. 

I had same problem.  Previous owner had replaced stock 77 system with
the 74 header/heat exchangers, but left this travesty of an oil line in
place.  It dangled way too exposed back there.  Eventually I hit something
which pushed one of the rubber components up to an exhaust pipe,
which wore and burned through it, big mess, etc, etc.

But you are in luck.  Just install the parts the factory used in '73 (when
the oil tank was back in the back again) and '74.  Factory only rerouted
the line when the favored spot under the "bellhousing" of the flywheel
side of the engine was taken over by the exhaust crossover pipe.  Now
that you have gotten rid of this excresence you can put this steel oil pipe
there, nicely nestled up against and protected by the engine.  This
terminates by the engine oil cooler, where a three part (steel - rubber -
steel) line attaches to get up to the external oil cooler thermostat. 
Automotion sells these for a bit less than $200 for both.  You may be
able to get them from a used parts place, although all other things
(money) being equal, used rubber oil lines are not as reliable as new
rubber.  I used this setup on my 2.7, and just transferred it (along with
the '74 exhausts) to the 3.0 when I installed it.

Go for it.
