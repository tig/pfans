I found a couple of things that are handy in a crunch and
thought I would share it with the list.

1) Large garbage bags.  If you ever have a flat, you will
discover that the only place to carry the flat tire and
wheel is in the car.  Put the tire in the bag to protect
your interior.  Better still, get a plastic tire bag from a
tire store, like Discount Tire.

2)  A long plastic tie wrap.  It may be called different
things but it is the ones like the cops use to cinch up bad
guys hands in place of handcuffs.  The longer the better. 
In the off chance the cable to your fuel door breaks, you
can use this to pop it open.  If you bend it a bit and feed
it down, across and back up the other side, you can pull
towards the rear of the car to pop the latch.  Some others
say fishing line will work but I found it easier because
this was much stiffer.  You might practice to get a feel for
the location of the latch.  It worked for me the first time.
