hi,
    i asked this question many mos. ago and during that time
i've changed computers and lost all my replies.
i would like to eliminate my points. i've heard about "pertronix"
from gpr and my question is about the tach hookup. does it hookup
in the same place?  i plan on keeping the original cd box and 
coil(transformer). i called gpr 4 times and the "porsche guy" has
been out sick.
i've tried to adjust the dwell on the points that came with the car
to stop the bouncy tach and idle roughness but all i can get is about 
28deg. they are probably wornout or the wrong ones.
i would greatly appreciate any advice on this subject.
i have finally finished the brakes and wheels and all thats left is
valve adjustment and tune up.
any others on the market besides crane and permatune?

thanks,
moe
