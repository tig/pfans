For your '81, I'm guessing that you have 7" sealed beam halogen
headlights.  These are standard units used on many cars in the US and
you can buy replacements at every auto parts store for $8-$12/each.  The
Hella "H4" is a direct replacement for the sealed beam type, but it has
replaceable halogen bulbs available in several wattages.  The intensity
of the light from the Hella is much brighter and the beam more defined
because of the superior bulb, reflector and lense.  These units go for
about $38/each.  Replacement is easy:

1. Remove trim ring
2. Remove the sealed beam headlight
3. Disconnect 3-prong plug
4. Install bulb into the Hella unit
5. Connect 3-prong plug to Hella
6. Mount into headlight bucket
7. Re-install trim ring

There you go, 5-10 minutes and you're done.  No mods or paint required.
It's as simple as replacing your stock sealed-beam headlight.  Your
stock wiring is fine with the 60/55w bulb that comes with Hella.  You
can get a 80/100w bulb (wow!), but it may cause problems w/ your stock
wiring.  However, I don't have any direct experience with this.
Performance sells a relay that is supposed to help in this regard.  All
the mail order p-car places have the Hella H4's.  Don't pay more than
$40/each.  Doc and Cy's had them for $33 in the catalog I have.

This was the best $80 I've spent on my car in a long time.  Happy
Holidays, Greg
