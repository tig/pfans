I wouldn't want to run them [R1's] in the rain either.  I have and it's no fun.
_______________________________
I keep my R1's on year round, and although I live in generally sunny
Southern California, it rains here a bit between November and March. 
While one must drive with some extra caution on R1's in the rain, I don't
find them to be that bad.  Indeed, I just instructed at an event at Willow a
few weeks ago, and the event wound up being run in the rain.  I took
several students out in my car on pretty well worn R1's, and it did
surprisingly well.


Actually, I don't think running 008RS's or R1's on the street is such a
great
idea.  You'd be surprised how 'hard' they get after 10 or 20 heat cycles.
Kind of defeats the purpose.
__________________________________
Actually, I've had no such problems, and as I noted previously, I've been
running these tires on the street for 10 years.  The reason your concern
above is not germain is because driving on the street, the tires don't go
through "heat cycles" like they do at the track.  Just driving around, even
hitting an on-ramp every so often never gets them up to the kind of temps
they see on the track, that would be considered a heat cycle.  I know it's
not an issue because I take the car to the track at least twice a year,
when I run my driver training event, and I observe that there is little
difference in my lap times between fresh R1's and R1's that are toward
the end of their life, after having been driven on the street for about 6
months.
