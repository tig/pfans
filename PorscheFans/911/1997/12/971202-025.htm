There has been a lot written about the reasons behind cold CIS
backfires.    I think the common conclusion is lean running, caused
by minor induction leaks (perhaps injector seals), coupled with the
tendency of the system to accumulate fuel vapor in the induction 
system when you make more than one start attempt, e.g., start
the car, back out of the garage, turn the car off, go inside, come 
back out, start the car and BANG. 

I think another contributing factor is the tendency of these systems
to fail to hold residual pressure.    This means that the car will have
to build fuel pressure from zero up to 70 psi before it will run well, 
with hesitant, lean starting coming somewhere in between, aggravated
when it is cold.     Just this morning I started my 928 when it was about
25 degrees out.    This car has a know problem with residual pressure.
I got several tailpipe backfires before it was running well.    Under
these conditions, if you get combustion at the wrong time, with an 
intake valve open, you will light off whatever fuel vapor is in the intake
runners, and blow fire back through the induction plumbing and the
air box.    
   

I've had it happen on other brands of car (Volvo, Mercedes), and it
is always on a cold start.  
You might pursue the seal issue, and make sure that fuel pressures
are correct.   Other than that, how does one ever know that something
has been prevented.    I have an anti-elephant attack whistle and have
never been subject to elephant attack . . . 

I guess the bottom line is that if you want to prevent this symptom, keep
the whole fuel system in top condition . . .
