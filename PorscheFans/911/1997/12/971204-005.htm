I'm experiencing an exhaust odor/smell that worries me a little. 
While at a signal or sitting in traffic with the heater on i get a slight smell
of exhaust,
not enough to loose coniousness yet :^()
I've checked the rubber hoses and everything for exhaust leaks and can't find
any. 
This leads me to believe that the car is running rich as when parked at idle if
you stand around the back of the car the smell
is pretty strong is this normal?
 I have a 86 with a Borla single outlet 4" and a Cat by-pass pipe. The smell
was there 3 weeks ago before removing the cat. conv. 
Is there a way to check the mixture as i presume it may be to rich. The car
runs fine and the oxygen sensor was clean as in there were no built up deposits
or anything like that on it. 
Any and all suggestions are appreciated.
BTW the car sounds even better with the cat "test" pipe and the Borla.
