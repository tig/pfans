Analog Mike wrote, re R1's:

The main reason NOT to run them on the street is that
while legal, they are NOT designed as a street tire. 
The Team T/A news has mentioned this.

Many people have gotten bad sidewall cracks from driving them
on the street, and some tire failures.
____________________________
I've been running R1's and Yok 008 RS's on the street for 10 years, and
have had very few failures.  I run them at 28 lbs in the front and 30 in the
rear, which has never caused any "groove of doom" problems, or any
others, for that matter.  Further, my pyrometer at the track tells me that
those pressure work pretty well.


 Maybe due to running
at too low pressures (which work for autox but not good on the
street as load range is drastically reduced). Also they
are very uncomfortable on the street.
_______________________________
I don't find them uncomfortable on the street at all.  Compared to the stock
suspension on my previous '93 RX-7 R1, my '90 C2 Cab with H & R
springs, larger Weltmeister adjustable anti-sway bars front and rear and
R1's feels downright comfy.
