Season's Greetings To All!
   And... a couple o' questions.  I have standard Boge shocks
on the front of my 86 Carrera, and I want to change them to
regular Bilsteins (not the heavy duty racing ones).  Are these
a direct bolt in replacement?  I've heard mention of "inserts",
but I don't know what this is.  After changing front shocks, is
a re-alignment required?  Is front shock changing an easy job?
The car is now on jackstands with front calipers, hubs and rotors
off.  I have a clear shot at the struts/shocks.
   RD Enterprises advertises in Pano a set of four Bilstein shocks
for $379.  Is this a good deal and are they a good company?
Thanks to all, and have a Merry!
Ray

Hello to all!   I have been lurking and am too anxious to wait any longer.

I want to buy a 911, from what little I know there was a cam chain tensioner
change in 1980 that resulted in a much more reliable car.  So I am looking for
a 1980 or newer car.  Style wise I prefer the Targa but am open to all.  Any
recommendations you all might have as to better years/models would be
appreciated.  I  would consider any drivable condition.  I want to drive this
car daily.

Suggestions on where to look, what to pay and someone in the Chicago area who
could give me a competent appraisal as to value would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks Ben,  Woodworking machinery dealer and wanna-be 911 owner
