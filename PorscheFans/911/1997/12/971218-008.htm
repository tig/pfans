In repairing my T-boned '68 912 Targa, the decision was made to replace both
doors, since the passenger side had been poorly repaired after damage
sustained by the PO.  The doors went on fine, fit is good, paint is done,
and re-assembley is ALMOST complete:  Problem with the door windows.  The
donor car was a '66 coupe, so the window channels from my '68 have been
transferred to the '66 doors.  We took care of the difference in the locking
mechanisms with a little judicious grinding.  The problem is, it appears,
with the regulators/window channel combination.  The regulators from the '68
were both in trouble, so I am using the regulators from the '66, but the
glass is from the '68 since it is tinted, and the original carrier channel
is currently attached.  I've noticed the '68 carrier has a nylon piece that
is supposed to travel the rear window channel, whereas the '66 does not.
The first weather strip that Stoddard sent me for the rear window channel
was NOT correct(# superceded by #superceded, by...etc)and the one they want
to try--still not sure if it's correct-- now is a cheap! $44 each, so I want
to see if anyone can give me some insight that would be beneficial.  The
first strip was just peeled up by the nylon piece on the carrier(the
weatherstrip was soft, not the required hard, and filled too much of the
channel), but even with the correct strip, it appears that the spacing
between the front and rear channels is wider than it should be.  When
rolling down the window it wants to tilt toward the front.  I'm beginning to
wonder if I should just transfer the glass from the '68 carrier to the '66
carriers without the nylon guide, and use the softer fuzzy weather strip
Stoddard sent.  Looks like that might work, though the coupe window frame
DOES have a HARD channel in the rear.  Or is my problem one of a difference
with the regulator?  They appear to be identical to my eye, but.....  Any
help would be greatly appreciated.
