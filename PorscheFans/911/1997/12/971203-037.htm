Philip:

No, they're not as bad as you've heard... Especially now that most 
of them have been rebuilt.

As originally built, the 2.7-liter 911S engines had barely-adequate
cooling, which was made worse in 1976 and 1977 when Porsche replaced
the 11-blade cooling fan with a 5-blade version.  They also had
mechanically-adjusted timing-chain tensioners, relatively-weak chain
ramps, and head-mounting studs whose coefficient of expansion was
all wrong. 

When anyone rebuilds one of those engines, though, he'll make sure 
that it has an 11-blade fan and the appropriate internal cooling 
mods, the correct chain ramps and (optionally) pressure-fed 
tensioners, and Dilivar (or RaceWare) studs.  A 2.7-liter engine with 
these improvements is QUITE durable.

On the other hand...

The 3-liter engine in the 911SC is more durable than even an upgraded
2.7, and a 911SC only costs a couple thousand dollars more than a
911S.  In fact, the 2.7's bad reputation is probably due more to the
relative reliability of the 3-liter than to any particular fault of
its own.
