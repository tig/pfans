I have exactly the same problem...

Diagnosis by myself and my local shop has so far not turned up anything.

The "whirling noise" is caused by a small fan that's at the back of the
heater unit - it's job is to draw air in through the hole, which is where
the thermostat resides. This is how the heater finds out the cabin air
temperature.

What I've done for now is to unplug the fan. Pull the heater unit out of the
dash, and you'll see that the fan is bolted to the back of the unit, and has
a 2-wire plug that plugs into the back of the unit. Pull the plug.

Your heater, etc, will still work - the only trouble will be that your heat
control will not be anywhere near as accurate.

PLEASE let me know if you ever find out the cause for the problem - and I'll
let you know too!!!

I have, incidentally, replaced my heater unit with a used one, problem still
remains. My shop has tried swapping it with one from another (working) car,
problem still remains - i.e. don't let a shop tell you that you need a new
heater unit - they're bloody expensive!

Cheers,

Ross
