Subject: 911 T  1972-74 parts wanted

>Hi all porsche fans!

>My husband just purchased a 1972 911t coupe.  I am the computer nut, thus the

>We are interested in finding
>
>1. a fuel pump for 1973-74 fuel injected engine 2.4L

The 72-early 73 has mechanical fuel injection and won't use the same pump as
the 74. Make sure he knows if it has the original or replacement FI before you
spend money on a fuel pump for a 73-74.

>2. a 1972 911t coupe back rubber window seal and bumper rubber seals front and
>back bumpers and a front bottom bumper piece.

I'll bet you're looking for the spoiler. If you need a new one get either an
'S' or one of the after market RSR's. They make a noticable difference in
handling over about 75 or 80 mph.

>3. electric antannae
>4. 74   5 speed transmission

There isn't any reason I know of to go to the later transmission. Both 72 and 74
had the 915 transmission.

>5. Good set of tires (corvette type, I think)

I'm using the Yoko's and they work really well. You will need to check the sizes
to see if any mod's have been make.

>6. and a 1972 911t whale tail

The first tails were the 'ducktails' on the 73 RS Carrera. There wasn't a 72
'Whale tail' as far as I know.
Try Automotion or Performance for the other parts.

>Also some manuals for the 911t.

Good luck, the older ones are fun but can require a lot of work.

awaiting the delivery of a new 98 Carrera S; the dealer is talking to me about
a security system Teletrack; he states that it is superior to Lojack and
doesn't recommend Lojack to his Porsche customers; anyone with any
information/recommendations; thanks a lot
