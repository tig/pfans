Nick,
  I just thought I'd add my 2 cents to Bobs wisdom:

I heated the piston up using a heat gun. The theory is that is would
expand the hole piston. Seemed to help the wrist pin come out easier. 
When you get around to putting them back in, put the wrist pins in the 
freezer first. They slide right in then. (Applied physics!)
When removing the circlips that hold the wrist pins in, it's a good idea 
to put a rag over the hole(s) in the case. That way if the circlip goes 
ballistic it can't fly into the case.

I started at one end and used a long 3/8" socket extension (wrapped in 
masking tape) to tap the shafts out.  Those shaft bores tend to have crud 
in them. If you don't _really_ clean them out before you remove the shafts, 
the crud will scratch the bores leading to leaks. Then you need to resort 
to using those little O-rings on the rocker shafts. Don't ask me how I
know...
When you put the shafts back, start at one end and use the long extension
with a torque wrench. Failure to torque those nuts properly can allow
the shafts to move around and wreck your cam carrier. Again, don't ask me 
how I know...

Automotion sells the cutest little 6mm (?) hex drive for this. Its short and 
you can get it in there and turn it with your fingers.

 P.S. Nick, couldn't get your address from your post else I would have
   CC'd you.
