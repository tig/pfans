Subject: 86 911 Brake upgrade

First, thanks to everyone for the education!  I am amazed at the amount I
have learned.

I am considering a brake upgrade for my stock 86 Carrera.  I know very
little about this subject so I am open to all comments.  I want to upgrade
to, at least, 930 brakes.

1.  What is the best way to do this?
2.  Do I buy the parts new from someplace like Design, or should I look for
used parts in Pano?   If used, I'm not in a big hurry, so I can scan Pano
and other sources until I find the correct parts.
3.  Does anyone have a complete parts list of what is required?
4.  Will there be a big difference if I only upgrade the fronts?  ( I heard
this suggestion at a DE event)
5.  Can I use my stock 16" Fuchs if I use stock 930 rotors?

I have seen very little information about this type of upgrade in the
archives.  Is a conversion like this worth the $$ or is another upgrade
better to begin with?  (ie exhaust.)

Thanks in advance.

Hi Don,

I used to have an 86 Carrera (really sorry I sold it) but I never
considered replacing the brakes because they are so good.  I am in the
process upgrading my 911 race car to 930 brakes but only because it is a
full race car.

In my 86 911, I did numerous track events (driver's ed) and always thought
I had more brakes than I needed.  I would recommend replacing the fluid
with ATE Super Blue and changing the pads for whatever application you use
your car (Pagid Oranges).  This will make a huge difference.  If your pedal
goes soft on the track after these upgrades, you could just add a larger
master cylindar.

If you do decide to go with the BIG BRAKES...I bought mine from Jeff at
Cool Rotors with a set of four cross drilled cool rotors.  These save about
10lbs a wheel of unsprung weight which should improve handling quite a bit.

Let me know if you need more info.
