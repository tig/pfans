Two books spring to mind...

"Excellence was Expected" by Karl Ludwigsen (sp?)
"Cars Are My Life" by Ferry Porsche and ??? (Ferry's autobiography)

I haven't read either for a little while but my recollection is that they
both touch on the subject. I can check tonight if you want as I've got
both at home. "Excellence was Expected" is an all-around fantastic book
but is very expensive...

Yeah! I couldn't believe how aggressive some of these guys were... the racing
was fantastic!

I think the guy you mention had tire smoke from damaged bodywork. Lots of
incidents in the race (which I don't particularly like to see), but also
lots and lots of good VERY close racing... also some VERY near disasters...
I can't remember the last time I saw a car travelling completely sideways
at 100+ mph with two wheels in the air - just on the edge of flipping.
Thank god she didn't catch a curb just then!

Cheers,

Ross
