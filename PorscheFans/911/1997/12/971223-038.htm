I would highly recommend what your friend has done, considering I have a
'75 with a 3.2 in it.

I did a complete rebuild, right down to bare metal/rebuilt every blessed
part in the thing. Engine was done by Kremer brothers and is a Euro 3.0
with the Kremer 3.2 pistons and cylinders, along with a few tweaks such
as SSI's and a bit of porting, polishing, boattailing of crank webs etc.
I put Carrera flares on it so I would have enough rubber on the road for
the power and am just in the process of replacing the transmission with
a 7/31 ring gear and Quaife limited slip. With the original transmission
(which went blooey on me) it was *very* fast....sounds much like your
friends car.

Total cost of everything, except my invaluable labour was about $50k
Canadian.....including all new interior, Recaro's, allnew paint and
suspension etc.....I doubt if I could find as good a car anywhere near
the price unless I was willing to lower myself to the tupperware
automobile contingent (aka Corvette's)
