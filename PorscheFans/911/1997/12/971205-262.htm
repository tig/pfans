    Garth:

    I don't know exactly (although I'm sure someone else has this
    information), but it's not much... A few pounds at most.

    No.

    Not for the weight difference.  You might, of course, want to
    modify your suspension to deal with the increased power.

    Must be page 141 in the revised second edition; my first-edition
    copy puts the horsepower/torque graph for that engine on page
    131.

    Anyway, the 2.7 Euro Carrera RS pistons are 90 mm in diameter,
    not 95... 95-mm pistons were used in the 3-liter cars.

    The engine Bruce describes has 2.7 Euro Carrera RS pistons and
    cylinders, E cams, Weber 40s, and the early exhaust with sport
    muffler; it makes 225 peak HP and 200 pound-feet of torque.

    The engine in my car is similar, although not identical... It has
    S cams and a different exhaust (the 911 exhaust, of course,
    doesn't fit in a 914), and it makes 250 HP and 220 pound-feet of
    torque.

    It's a great engine; the powerband is real wide, so it's easy to
    drive on the street.

    Try to find a "7R" magnesium case... As Bruce says in his book,
    they're the best for building any engine up to 2.8 liters.

> Will I need to upgrade to a 915 transmision for this?

    I don't know... If you were putting the engine in a 914, I'd say
    no, but the 911s are heavier and may overstress your 901
    transmission.  You'd have to ask a 911 guy about this.
