Thanks to Neil and Joel for responding to my post. Glad to hear from
P-fans who have Pertronix Ignitors that work!  I like the idea of a magnetic pickup -- set the timing and forget it!  I ordered my Pertronix unit from Automotion, and it was supposed to be the correct one for my Porsche, (l975 911 S Targa with Permatune CD box and stock coil).  When it came the directions didn't seem to apply to my car, so that's why I took it to my local P-wrench.  The three units I sent back to Automotion did turn out to be defective, as did others they sold from the same batch -- it wasn't an issue of getting the wires crossed.  The customer service guy at Automotion says that Pertronix is a small company and they have had some quality control problems.  He also said that German Parts and Restoration (GPR) has a lot of experience with this product, so I may call them with my distributor # as Neil suggested and and give it another try!  Margaret, let us how how you do with yours!

The list is back up and now over 2000 members!  The Porsche parts companies that we are buying from should realize that when they sell "junk" or "bone" us (as Joel put it) then we are apt to discuss it on the list.  This list is a great resource, and also a powerful tool -- we should be able to expect fair value for $ spent!
