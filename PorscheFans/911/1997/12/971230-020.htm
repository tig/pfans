greetings, all.....just wanted to take the pulse of the masses about a
930 i'm considering buying. It's a '76 930 that was rolled and took most
of the damage on the roof. FWIW, the PO put a 959 kit on the car and
with even the light damage to the fiberglass panels, those parts are
pretty much a wash. Some vandals stole the seats and there's no
windshield or rear glass. Also, the PO put DP 959-lookalike wheels on
it, obviously no turbo fuchs to rescue from the car. The only salvation
from this tragedy seems to be the motor which sounds extremely healthy
when i throttled up, but may have a vacuum leak since it idled a teeny
bit rough-it's been sitting for five months and was spitting some water
out of the exhaust. Basically, i'm considering buying it as a parts car
for the motor, tranny, suspension and brakes. The odometer shows 24K on
it, but there's no title, as the car has a mechanic's lien attatched or
some sort of nefarious deed. What do you, the masses think? Any idea
what the motor, tranny and suspension are worth? What would be a fair
price to pay for the entire car?? Please respond asap, either directly
or to the list, since there are a couple of other vultures circling
about. Thanks in advance.
