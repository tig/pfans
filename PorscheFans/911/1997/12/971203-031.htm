Thanks, Jim. This is the first succinct explanation I have read of how a
torson diff works.

Which leads to a question: how long do they last? Being an interference-fit
gear system, I assume that there will be wear on the gear faces. Is there
any simple way to quantify how long a Quaiffe will last, say, in a regularly
autocrossed 911?

Thanks,

    Eric, '86 911 (for sale, see http://www.nwlink.com/~kool)
