Brian,
	My dad took a Bug towbar and modified the ends. We originally hooked it to the 
bottom of the car, I don't know where but it did not have enough ground 
clearance. We then drilled two holes in the bottom of the front bumper. We put 
the male end of our mount through the hole and put nuts on the bolts. To hook 
the male and female ends together we used pins from a trailer hitch. Look at 
the picture I have drawn to see what I'm talking about. Also I will mail a 
printed signed copy anywhere in the U.S. for $5. If any one needs any further 
explanation I will be glade to help.

Subject: 911/914 Towbars?
To: 911@PorscheFans.com

     Has anyone seen (or better yet) used a towbar to pull a 911 or 914?
     A 914-list member bought up the subject and I've decided now that
     I need one to take car back and forth to welding shop and painter.


     If no one makes one, I'd be willing to design and do a limited run
     if list members want to get one.  I'm a Mechanical Engineer by trade
     and fortunately, my retired Master Machinist/Welder father is always
     looking for a good project or two.

     Not wanting to reinvent the wheel I'd much rather buy one.  It is
     hard to beat the convenience of towing a Beetle or Ghia with the
     towbar slipping over the beam axle and completing hookup in 5 minutes.
     My goal would be to have a towbar (either design or buy) with that
     sort of convenience for the 911/914.

     Anyone seen one?

     Any interest in a custom designed unit?

     thanks
