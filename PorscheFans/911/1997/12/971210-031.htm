Troy,

I have the same problem with my '79 930.  Did it before and after I
removed the thermal reactors and stock exhuast.  It seems very cold
blooded and only has to set for a few minutes in cold weather with the
engine off, to have high idle on restart.  A '76 930 that I drove a
couple times last year also had this problem.  It also would stall or
"pop" when the engine was very cold.  Is it the nature of the beast or
is there something else going on?

I usually find that a couple of hard whacks with my 32 oz. ball-peen
hammer cures practically any problem.

Seriously, you can try adjusting the door closure at the door latch - move
the catch on the door jamb in slightly might help without making it too
hard to open the door.

The door frame is adjustable both laterally and vertically, as I remember.  I
think you might have to remove the door pull and upholstery to do this,
if I remember right.  Apparently you don't have a shop manual; might 
recommend the one made by Haynes; it's inexpensive (<$25) and pretty
complete.  Sorry I can't be more specific; I sold my shop manuals when I
sold my '84 Carrera two years ago.

I don't like the wind noise I hear around the passenger side door when at
speed (there's also a tad bit of noise from the drivers door). It seems that
the seals are not completely sealing. I know I'm being anal about this, but
does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? I could somehow get
more seal material in there (ugh). Or I could perhaps bend the window frame
in some so it seals better (eek!)?
