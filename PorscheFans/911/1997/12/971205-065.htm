There are 4 separate pieces that seal the targa top to your car.  The front
seal runs across the entire windshield and down both pillars.  The side
seals fit into your targa top, and the rollbar seal runs across the entire
roll bar.  As far as I've seen, Vertex (Check out Excellence or Pano) has
the best prices by far, and claim that the rubber is from the German OEM.
I've talked with several people about this because I plan on replacing my
seals this winter.  The advice I've gotten is buy the genuine stuff even if
it's more expensive, because the replicates won't fit properly.  I'm going
to try Vertex, as I've heard good things about them from others on this
list.  As far as installing goes, I don't think the side seals are that
difficult because there is "gutters" that the seals fit in, but the front
and rear seals will take more time and patience.  Be sure to mark the
location of the old seal before pulling it off.  I'm assuming that if I
take my time, and prepare properly, it shouldn't be that difficult.

Good luck,

Bob

Subject:  Targa Front Roll Bar Seal




I need to replace the piece which seals the top and both sides of the
"Roll Bar" on the top of my 87 Targa. The part is avail through Tweeks
at an outrageous cost-they call it the "front seal".
Has anyone attempted this and if so what are the tricks to success??The
only thing I really want to replace is the RH and LH vertical strips of
molding that come in contact with the window (the material is faded and
degraded badly) but apparently the only way to do that is to replace the
complete piece which is the bar that spans the sides and the top.
Any help is appreciated.
