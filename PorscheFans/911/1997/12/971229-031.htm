Terry,

For what it's worth, the sans-tranny method is almost always the
one selected by my main wrench, a guy who I trust absolutely.
I think once you lower the rear motor mounts, the bolts on the
tranny aren't too tough to get to.  I'm no expert, having done it
only twice, but don't remember any problem.  Additionally there
are a few things that don't have to come loose from the tranny and
there's one less big part floating around the shop.  Also, the
part you have to maneuver on the way out and on the way in
is lighter by one transmission.  Going in just takes some
careful use of the floorjack on which the engine is perched and
the confidence that it will go if you do it right.  I don't know if
this would be the best approach without a car hoist, however,
as part of the drill going in is car up, motor under, car down a 
bit, rough alignment, maybe adjust car height, motor matched
to tranny, tranny bolts in, raise motor or lower car to get the
rear motor mounts close.  On the other hand, you gotta do 
essentially all this if you're reinstalling the motor-tranny combo.
