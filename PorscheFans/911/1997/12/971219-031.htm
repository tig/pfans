     I do, but when this was happening I was just driving side streets 
     (< 35mph); so I wasn't breaking heavy.  But thanks I'll watch to see 
     if this is part of the pattern.

When coming to a stop, were you downshifting (breaking w/ the engine)? 
You might be sucking oil past the valve stem seals when the throttle 
plate is closed.

I am forwarding this for Jim McCarthy, owner of Windward

Dear P-Fans,

In response to recent listings, let me assure you, at Windward Performance
Products, the customer always comes first.  Given the thousands and thousands
of transactions we have succesfully consumated over the past 12 years, I will
be the first to say, we are not perfect.  We are a million dollar company, run
by people with a real passion for Porsche automobiles.  I started this company
because of all the BS I experienced in the Porsche performance parts
aftermarket.  Occasionally, mistakes or miscommunications are made.  Every
single time, I want to know about it.  I want to fix it.  I want to make it
right.  I am in business to do business, not to lose customers.  Period.  

Do business where you want, but know how I feel about what we do at Windward.
Thanks.

Jim McCarthy
