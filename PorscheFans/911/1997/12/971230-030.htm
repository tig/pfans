The list should give thanks to Ron Shaw for his scholarship concerning
the complicated etymology of this word.  Had it not been for his timely
post we might have been relegated to some bad guesses based on the
meanings of the word roots.  Pan is the Greek for all, as in pantheist or
pandemic or panacea, and so on, so one might have supposed it was
based on an overall smell (a common topic amongst aficionados of air
cooled cars with exhaust heat exchangers and oil leaks) emanating from
the heating system, rather from the floor pan itself.

Amazing what one can learn on this list, repeating messages and all. 
Ron's exegesis makes it easy to see why the PCA founders didn't
choose panorama, one of whose meanings is a comprehensive
presentation of a subject, instead, for our beloved magazine's name.
