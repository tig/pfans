Just my ramblings, no real Porsche content.

P-Fans:

Regarding recent postings of poor service/parts etc... 

Basically what it comes down to is do not sign for anything unless you
have personally inspected everything about what you are receiving.  It
is much easier to take care of any problems at the time of receipt then
later because you will not have paid yet.  If it is mail order do not
accept the shipment until you have inspected the contents.  Obviously
for those of you who receive engines this would be a little hard.

I use the hoops rule: my suppliers can screw up provided they jump
through hoops to fix everything once the problem has been identified.
Mistakes happen, sometimes even twice in a row.  You can not expect
someone to pay you for pointing out that they gave you bad service/parts
(most people get pissed when their short comings are exposed). The best
you can hope for is an apology, a good quick fix, and maybe a discount.
If it is consistent or they are rude at any time, I thank them nicely
for their service and find another.  It just takes some patience.  Think
of yourself as chasing your instructor down a really windy road, because
it will take a lot of patience to wait for that one moment where you
think you can get by.

With our cars this thing about patience gets blown up a little.  By this
I mean we, as Porsche fans, need an extra dose or six.  I think that by
being a <substitute your high performance vehicle here> fan you indicate
that you want top performance, not just from your car, but from
everything around you.  But, I think, it is hard for a supplier to
compete with the performance our cars give us.  So cut them some slack,
always be nice, and if you feel you got a raw deal say so and vote with
your wallet.  Because when it gets to the end of the rope, we as
consumers have very little recourse except where we spend our money.

Thanks for your time,

-Michael
