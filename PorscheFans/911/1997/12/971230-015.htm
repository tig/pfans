Denny,
     Not positive you do, but I think so.  "78-'84 for sure.  Most injected
engines have something like this somewhere on the system.  Yours would be
on the driver's side, about in the middle of the bank on the intake
manifold.  A fuel line from the fuel distributor, and a wire attached to
the valve "point to it.

An additional thought on the synthetic vs. non-synthetic oil in a new/rebuilt
engine question:

The lubricating properties and viscosity and other properties of both
synthetic and non-synthetic oils are basically identical within any brand and
weight of oil.  This was not true when synthetics were first available.  How
could the break in properties be any different?  (Valvoline claims they are
identical.)  Don't new Porsches some with Mobil 1 as factory fill?  

Conclusion:  Perhaps we are dealing with something like 'old mechanics tales?'
