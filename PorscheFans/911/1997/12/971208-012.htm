Can anyone tell me where the silver colored braided cable with the
female end which is part of the DIN cable which comes from the factory
power amplifier attaches to the radio or chassis.  I had a local car
stereo installer install an Alpine 601 CD changer to the factory in dash
cassette unit. I've had a battery run down problem ever since. In
undoing what he did I discovered this  cable connected to nothing
though, of course,  the DIN cable was attached to the back of the radio.
I also have a morse code like sound coming from the right door tweeter
in the CD mode which is unaffected by the volume control as the sound is
a constant volume which stops only with pause or changing to tape or
radio . I've changed the CD player, the PIE interface cable, the tweeter
- all to no avail.  When I spoke with the installer he said " you know I
never did work on one of those Porsches before!" Anyone know about the
cable, battery run down problem or the beeping noise please e-mail
gdavis@zoomnet.net
Thanks

George
