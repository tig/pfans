My key started to become hard to turn and I had to wiggle it around a bit
before it would work.  I had some copies of the key (yes the same key that
didn't work too well) made and that fixed the problem.  I didn't think it
would since I used the old worn key to make the duplicates but it did.  Might
be worth a try.  One side note though was I had to go to a Porsche dealer to
have the key made as all the local locksmith shops had key blanks that were
too thick (they worked everywhere except in the ignition).  I don't know what
would cause the passenger side to unlock itself though.
