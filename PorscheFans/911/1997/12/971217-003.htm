Hi William and Harvey,
I also remove the cruise control from the throttle linkage side, although I
have an 85 Carrera, I assume the SC is the same.  I have made one change and
that is to replace the phillips screws connecting it to the throttle linkage
with small allen headed ones.  Make sure they are short enough that they do
not hamper the throttle linkage travel.  I have found it is a lot easier to
remove and to re-install them than it was with the phillips.
I have been told by a local P-wrench that the proper way is to disconnect it
from the servo.

Good luck.
Jon
