     Hi Glenn,
     
     Upgrading to the H-4 lights is about the best $100 you can spend.  The 
     lights my car came with were horrible.  The difference in the 
     brightness and the way the light is projected really makes a big 
     improvement.  I went with the 55/60, but you might look into the 
     55/100 if you do a lot of night driving (these might need a relay).  
     
     Also, you might want to check your headlight adjustment if you haven't 
     already.  Mine were angled down, and after adjusting them up it 
     improved them even more.
     
     BTW, these are sold for off road use only and are not legal for road 
     use. 
     
     
     Thanks,

        Question on whether Hella H-4 replacement headlights with 55/60 
     watt bulbs
     will produce the same illumination as factory (European style) 
     headlights.  My
     911 currently has sealed beam halogen lights which are terrible at 
     night.  If
     the Hella's produce sufficient light seems like a quick and 
     inexpensive cure
     to my night driving problems.
     
     Thanks
     Glen 82'SC
