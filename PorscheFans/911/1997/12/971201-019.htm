I've been practicing double clutching in my '87, and the G50 loves it.  It
seems to allow much faster upshifting out of first gear, and I never get a
"crunch" as the shift lever drops into the new gear.  Downshifting is great.
But now this:

John wrote with a humorous story about double clutching during downshifting
from 5th to 2nd gear.  He described the instructor's strategy of double
clutching into each successive gear 5-4-3-2.  I can't stand it, so I've got
to ask:  Why not just double clutch directly from 5-2?  Seems to me like the
throttle blip in neutral would spin up 2nd gear regardless if you're comming
out of 5th or 3rd.  Of course you'd have to wait until your car slowed enough
to avoid over-revving when you finally engage 2nd gear...

Maybe the instructor just always wants to have the engine in gear in case he
needs to accelerate for some unexpected reason?

Racers please help!
