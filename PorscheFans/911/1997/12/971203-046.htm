Porshe Fans,
        This is my first visit to this group, sure glad I found it!  I have
a 1980 911SC, it runs very well in all respects.  There is one problem. 
Sometimes after driving a half hour or so, when the engine is fully warmed
up I will come to a stop and the engine idle will be very high.
(1800-2000rpm)  This doesn't happen all the time,only sometimes.  I used to
be able to put the car in gear and slowly release the clutch to reduce the
speed to normal, and it would stay there.  Now when I try this in a few
seconds the speed increases again.  I have read about some possibilities,
oxy sensor(replaced) auxilliary air valve, warm-up regulator etc.  If
anyone has experienced this problem and have been able to correct it I
would sure like to know what was done.
                                                   thanks in advance,
                                                                           
  Jim
