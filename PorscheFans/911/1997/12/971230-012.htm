From previous post:

In my opionion these are both very high quality wheels!
I attended a tech session on wheels at the last Parade in Texas, given
by HRE. They do make wheels to your order, but are only human and
mistakes are occasionally made. If you demand that they correct their
error they will make them right! If the error is your problem, your
specification, they can still correct it, only on your buck!
The presenter offered the opinion that the Kinesis wheels were excellent
products as HRE has been known to polish their wheels for them,
apparently their businesses are very close to one another! 
It appears to me that the wheel halves are the same parts and the
difference is only in the centers.
HRE offered the opinion that the mesh wheels were lighter and stronger
than the five spoke designs.
The various high end three piece wheel manufacturers, HRE, Kinesis,
Fikse, etc. offer a diffenent aesthetic, and which ever you prefer is
the right one for you! But each is a very high quality product!
