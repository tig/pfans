I tried to post this yesterday, and it didn't work.  I think the Chris
Mellor incident may have clogged the system.

Hi Bob and Dennis,

The following assumes the sender in your 83 is the same as the
one in my '72's.  I'm pretty sure it is -- about 2" in diameter,
a foot long.

I've been round and round the repair loop with two senders.  Both
had the same problem, and from what I hear, it's fairly common.
The float, which rides up and down on two fairly fine resistance
wires, tends to get hung up on the wires.  You might even be able
to feel some slight 'kinks' in the wire if you run your fingers up and
down it.  (I'm told that the human finger can detect textural
changes of less than 0.0001".  That's why I'm a big advocate of
adjusting one valve carefully, giving it a shake and getting the feel
of 0.004", and then simply shaking all the rest and only
adjusting the ones that feel wrong.  Bruce Anderson once asked me
if I'd go to a brain surgeon who worked the same way.  But I digress
from fuel sending units.)

I guarantee you won't be successful trying to iron out the kinks.
You might think you've smoothed them, and the sender might even work
for a tank or two of gas, but it won't last.  Trust me.

You can try to replace the resistance wire **if** you can find
the right stuff.  I couldn't.  I did manage to get some with the
right resistance, but of finer gauge, from a
fellow P-philer, Reid Zeigler, who I haven't seen on P-fans because  he
sold his 911 to finance his daughter's college education.  He worked
for Merck pharmaceuticals, and had resistance wire in his lab.  Why?
I can't imagin.  But again,  I digress.

Alas, the wire was so fine, it was impossible to work with, and
by the time I finally managed to get it soldered in place, it was kinked
up worse than the stuff I took out.

As a result, I drove around with inoperative fuel gauges, until I
sold my '72 Targa.  I wanted the new owner to have a good car, and
I bought and installed a new sender for him ($65 or so).  I felt I too
ought to have, indeed deserved, a proper gauge, and so put one in the '72
Coupe that I kept.

When the gauges were inoperative, I never ran out of gas.  How much
you want to bet that I will now?

Best,


Bob Spindel
