I have some problem with the kinked wire theory. My conjecture has been
that the wires get shellacked with residue from the gas over many years,
which is why these problems appear in older cars. My gas gauge is acting up
and it is probably time to examine the sender, so I confess that I have not
been "in there" yet.

Nevertheless, how do the wires get kinked? If you say that sharp turns and
bumpy roads do it, then the problem would appear fairly early, particularly
in daily drivers. I doubt that is the case. The shellacking theory says
that the wires are wet with gas, the gas dries and leaves a coating on
them. This coating gets washed off with the next tank of gas or sloshing of
the gas on the next drive. Of course, statistics is working against us here
and after some time, 10+ years, the shellac produced by the gas wins.

My guess is that fuel additives can only go so far with cleaning the wires,
that they have to be scrubbed or scraped to make them optimally conductive
again. Of course, this may all be moot if the wires have lost surface
conductivity due to some surface absorption effect. Has anyone tried
cleaning the wires? One option would be to soak the sender in a strong
solvent that one would normally not add to the tank.

Finally, is the float at fault here? Without examining one I cannot
comment, but I suppose that it could be the source of problems.
