Hi Brian,

You need to jack up the car and insert jackstands, extended to 21", under
the rear torsion bar extensions -- the things just forward of the rear wheels.
Then, with the rear apron removed, and your engine lowered onto a standard
floor jack, the engine will just clear everything as you roll it out.

If all you have is one of those little jacks, the kind with a removable
handle, I think it'll be hard.  A fairly heavy duty one, the kind that has
a fixed handle (How about these technical descriptions...), works fine.
They cost about $100 at almost any auto parts store.

You'll know if it's the rear seal when you get the flywheel off. It should be
pretty obvious.  My guess, based on limited experience -- it's hard for
a home mechanic to have anything but limited experience -- is the case
halve seal.  I just tore down a '73 911T engine that dripped pretty nicely
from the area you describe -- the bottom center, near the rear -- and the
rear seal was perfect.  I'm assuming it's the case halves.  I did a '72 T a
while ago that had the same problem, and it too had a perfect rear seal.
That one is back together now, with the case halves resealed, but it still
lays down a drop or two in the first hour or so after parking it.   I think
the only solution is to re-machine the case halves, which is a fairly major
undertaking.  Anyone else know what can be done?

I'm thinking of using RTV 730 on the present engine instead of the older
recommended Locktite, on the theory that it's a bit goopier and might do a
better job sealing a case that might be slightly out of whack.  I am also
considering an old timer's trick of running a piece of thread around the
seal.  Any have any experience either way?

Happy New Year everyone!
