I have a 1990 911 C4 with about 69k miles.  A few months back the car =
started making a high pitch squel (like a human whistle) coming from the =
engine compartment.  The pitch varies with engine RPM.  Doesn't matter =
if car is moving, clutch engaged, etc.  Seems to do it more frequently =
when air temps are cold (<40 F).

I appears from the direction it is coming from that it could be the =
colloing fan's bearing or maybe some part of the dual distributors.  But =
really - I have no clue.

Any suggestions on what would commonly cause this type of noise?  BTW, I =
have had the distributor belt break, replaced and the vent kit added.

Thanks,
Scott Kelly

         Just a note to be aware of Motor Sport Road and Racing who has
recently posted some parts for sale. 
         I purchased a racing seat from him that was more "used" than I was
lead to believe. I told him that I wasn't happy with the condition of the seat
and that I would like to return it. He said fine. Some how UPS could not find
his address stated on the bill. He claims he never got it and UPS said the
address didn't exist. The seat is in limbo with UPS. It is pretty hard to
check out both parties when they are 3000 miles away. All that I am saying is
make sure you know what you are getting and that you heavy insure it.
