Claude, from my 24,000 miles of 993 experience along with suffering thru
warped rotors, I suspect that your rotors are warped, too.  One way to
check is to jack up one front wheel, step on the brake, then spin the wheel.
See if it is smoothly rotating around entire rotation or if (I suspect) there
is one spot on the rotation where it's significantly harder to turn.  Might
have
to repeat the brake pedal push after one or two turns to push pads back
against the wheel.  Repeat on other front wheel.

If the ABS or ABD is acting up, you should get a warning light showing
up on the dash.  You not seeing it every time might be a function of 
deceleration rate; the harder you brake, the less is the vibration, if I
remember my experience right.

(reply to):
I just acquired a '96 993 C4.  It now has ~5500 miles, of which I put on
~2500.

I've noticed the following problem when braking gently to a stop from say
30 mph or so:  Upon gentle application of the brake pedal, the steering
wheel oscillates (not vibrates) about (+/-) 3 to 5 degrees (about the
steering column axis) while the speed drops from ~30 to ~15 mph; then the
oscillation stops as the car further decelerates to a smooth stop.  I want
to also emphasize that this doesn't occur EVERY time I stop.  The fact that
it doesn't happen repeatably means (to me) that it isn't warped rotors; if
the rotors were warped, the objectionable behavior would be observed each
time I stop.

I think this could be a malfunction with the ABS or maybe the Automatic
Brake Differential (ABD) or maybe with the Dynamic Four-Wheel Drive.
Anybody seen this problem before?

Thanks in advance.....
