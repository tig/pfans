An endurance racer explained it this way to me:

In an endurance race he downshifts through each gear to save on brakes, as
a result he is in the habit of downshifting through the gears. He also
reenforces this habit because he might forget which gear or gears he is
skipping during the battles that go on while trying to outbrake his
oponents right before a corner. So he goes through all the gears all the
time to avoid mis-shifts into the wrong gear (which could end his race with
a "mashed" gearbox).
