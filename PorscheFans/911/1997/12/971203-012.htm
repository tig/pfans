This IS an interesting thread.........Thought about it last nite and read
Andy's eloquent dissertation this am.  I realized that I use both
techniques, depending on the corner and how familiar I am with it.......

I was searching my mind for an explanation of why I row through the gears
some of the time and was formulating a thesis based on "timing" or the
rythym one develops to get around a circuit consistently.  Andy's
explanation of amount of attention available certainly helped explain 80% of
what I was looking to say.

Beyond that, when at a new track, rowing down through the gears helps me
determine which is the best gear to be in for a given corner, especially
when it's a close call.  For example, at Thunderhill last weekend, we drove
the new section addition.  The last turn off the new section back onto the
old was a puzzler.  There was no obvious apex and you were setting up to
turn into the old turn 9 whick led onto the front straight. The actual apex
was somewhere in  the middle of the pavement.  You couldn't see the next
turn as a hill is in the way.  Downshifting through the gears was useful to
establish that going through in third both took me into the turn with too
much speed and bogged the  engine a bit too much on exit.  Next time around
I rowed down into  second and determined that I had enough revs left to pull
me through the corner into a very short straight section where an upshift
was comfortable before the apex of the turn onto the straight.  Going
through the gears helped me establish the safe reference point where I
wanted to be on the throttle in second.  If I had tried to go 4-2 before
going thru this exercise, it's likely that I would have downshifted a tad
early and strained the driveline at clutch release or worse.

Next time through, I trail braked to a point just ahead of where I wanted to
be on throttle in second, shifted down 4-2 and accellerated thru to the next
turn. This turned out to be the quickest way thru in the 944.

So, both techniques work and I find going thru the gears helps establish
braking and turn in points and once I'm comfortable with them I find myself
skipping some gears and modifying the timing as is seems a bit more
efficient and frees up some "attention" for other decisions......
