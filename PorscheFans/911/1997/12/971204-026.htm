Dave Sawyer pleads for help.  6 month's dormant car ran for half mile,
made horrible noise, died.  Now starts, runs fine for 2 minutes, runs
rough, dies (and no horrible noise?).

  Mechanic says this isn't chain tensioner collapse/skipped tooth.  I agree.
  The tensioners are on the slack side of the chain, and even when they
collapse, the idler wheel is still somewhat in its normal position, and the
chain rails, which in his '79 are fine pieces, also help keep the slack in
the chain in line a bit.  So a collapsed tensioner leads to a racket, and a
well founded fear that driving that way for too long, and certainly at any
high RPM, is bound to do no good.  But you've got to get it whipping
around, break a chain rail, whatever, to get it to skip a tooth.  Advice I
have heard given by mechanics to people who have had this happen in
inconvenient places suggests you can indeed limp home and get it fixed
(which friends have done without untoward sequelae).  In the early cars
with the justly maligned hard rubber chain rails, things were much more
dicey.  So a tooth probably hasn't been skipped.  If really concerned,
chain timing is easy to check:  requires only taking off both intake covers
and using a dial indicator on the #1 and #4 intake valves, something any
P mechanic can do no sweat.  Besides, symptoms don't fit such a
diagnosis - a skipped tooth is not a small change in valve timing, it is a
pretty big change (although your CIS valve to head clearance might allow
one tooth either way without hitting?), and if valve timing is off enough
so engine won't idle (or keep a steady 1500 rpm with just a touch of
throttle) for more than a minute, it shouldn't idle or start at all. 

I'd drain gas tank and blow out and maybe replace the filter, keeping an
eye on what came out for water or gunk, since something like this seems
a potential, although hardly inevitable, consequense of leaving the car sit
for 6 months.

I'd also check the big ribbed rubber boot connecting the air sensor plate
to the throttle body for cracks or tears or plain looseness.  While I was at
this I'd check air filter and air box and sensor plate assembly for
something out of place - animal nest?  Also check around all vacuum
lines, especially the large ones which connect the auxiliary air valve.

I can't convince myself that your auxiliary air valve (which gives more air
to the richer mixture the warmup regulator provides a cold engine)
staying open when the warmup regulator has leaned out the mixture
would lead to total stalling, nor have this effect in the time frame you
give.

Excessive backpressure can cause an engine to stall after running a
while, and sitting can relieve this past rings etc. so it can start again. 
Mice clogged up the exhaust?  My brother once had an Atomic 4 engine
in his sailboat with an exhaust flapper which sometimes stuck shut or
mostly shut, leading to somewhat similar symptoms (no noises, though)
and, because intermittent, much bafflement.   Hold you hand over the
exhaust pipe to see if it seems like enough exhaust is coming out?   If
not, maybe take the muffler off, in case a loose baffle is blocking things? 

None of my suggestions, offered diffidently and only because of your
heartfelt plea, account for the original horrible noise, though.  For better
or worse, horrible noises in my engines have seldom just disappeared
(once a loose accelerator pump injector in a VW fell into manifold and
cylinder, making bad but not quite horrible noises, after a while got spat
out the exhaust with no real harm done, but you can't be so lucky).
Maybe someone who has had your exact problem and figured it out will
chime in with some real help.
