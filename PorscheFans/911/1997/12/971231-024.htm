Hi Brian.  You ask:

By rear do you mean near the transmission?  I had a similar drip from =
the crankcase halves at this location. I also feared it was the joint =
between the case halves, but now that I have the engine out, it's clear =
that the leak is coming from above, dripping down the side of the =
engine, and turning up at the case halves.  There is a heavy coat of =
caked-on oil around the breather/oil thermostat, continuing down the =
front of the engine sheetmetal around the flywheel.

There are three possible sources up there.  One, the o-ring on the oil =
thermostat that's already been mentioned.  Second, the oil (temp, press? =
 I can never remember which one this is.) sensor.  Either the sensor =
itself where the wires go in, or where it screws into the case.  The =
third is the breather hose.  That appears to be my problem.  The hose =
has gotten hard with age, is loose around the breather fitting, and =
can't be tightened any further with the clamp.

Seems most people advise replacing the thermostat o-ring and oil sensor =
gasket when you have the engine out as preventative maintenance, because =
they're now so easy to get to.  That's my plan.

Hope this helps, and that your leak is one of the fairly simple fixes =
above.
