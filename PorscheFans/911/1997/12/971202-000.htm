Brad and Hank:

I don't know how "interesting" the discussion will be, but I can 
guarantee that it'll be a LONG discussion if everyone else has as 
much to say about this as I do.  Here goes...

I'm a 5-4-3-2 guy, for two reasons.

The first one's easy to explain:  I really, REALLY like the sound of 
my motor being revved.

The second reason's more complicated...

I've mentioned Keith Code's book, "A Twist of the Wrist", on the list
before.  Ostensibly about road-racing motorcycles, this $15 paperback
book shaped the way I approach EVERY problem I encounter... As I've
said before, it changed my life.

Anyway... All the advice in the book stems from Code's realization 
that each of us has only a certain, fixed amount of attention to 
spend at any given moment.  He uses money as an analogy, saying 
that a rider has, for example, only ten dollars' worth of 
attention.  Just as with real money, the idea is to spend your 
"attention money" as wisely as possible... Since the total amount you 
have is fixed, you don't want to waste it.

The relevant quote from the book's Introduction is:

    "ATTENTION HAS ITS LIMITS [his emphasis].  Each person has a
    certain amount of it, which varies from individual to individual.
    You have a fixed amount of attention just as you have a fixed
    amount of money.  Let's say you have a ten-dollar bill's worth of
    attention. If you spend five dollars of it on one aspect of
    riding, you have only five dollars left for all the other
    aspects.  Spend nine and you have only one dollar left, and so
    on.

    "When you first began to ride, you probably spent nine dollars
    of your attention on how to let out the clutch without stalling.
    Now that you've ridden for years and thousands of miles, you
    probably spend only a nickel or a dime on it.  Riders tell me
    that some common movements, LIKE SHIFTING [my emphasis], have
    become 'automatic.'  It's not true.  They are simply spending
    less attention on it.  Riding is like that.  The more operations
    you reduce to the cost of a nickel or dime, the more of your ten
    dollars worth of attention is left for the important operations
    of riding or racing." 

Code goes on to point out that you have to make HUNDREDS of decisions
on every lap of a racetrack (and he backs up this claim later by
listing over one hundred distinct decisions that you can make just
about using the brakes), and asserts that a "fair rider" will have
decided in advance how to correctly handle only about 25 of them.

Each of the remaining decisions costs some of your attention... If
the total cost for all those decisions reaches the total amount of
attention you have to spend, there's nothing left over for things
like experimenting and improving your ability and lap times; if the
cost EXCEEDS your $10 allowance, you probably go off the track.

Now, Keith Code's book IS about motorcycles, and they all have
sequential shifters anyway, so of course he doesn't spend a lot of
time discussing the issue of skipping gears on downshifts.  The rest
of this message, therefore, explains only my PERSONAL position on the
question.

Ok...

Downshifting is something you do a lot of.  If you're racing, you do
that downshifting at the one moment that your attention is
most highly taxed:  You're trying to judge your braking accurately,
looking for your turn-in point, possibly trying to pass someone else,
probably trying to avoid being passed, etc.

All those things deserve your attention, but while you're trying to
deal with them, you have to operate all three pedals, the steering
wheel, AND the shift lever simultaneously... And you have to make
those physical operations PRECISELY, because unexpected events (like
a misjudged shift that locks the wheels for an instant or makes the
car lurch off-balance) can make you panic, which costs $9.99 of your
attention.

So...

It makes sense to reduce the downshifting operation to the simplest, 
most mechanical, rote sequences that you can.

If you ALWAYS downshift through the gears sequentially (e.g., you
always go through 4th and 3rd on your way from 5th to 2nd), you have 
to train your body to perform just four downshifting operations:

    5th to 4th,
    4th to 3rd,
    3rd to 2nd,
    2nd to 1st (optional, for those of you whose cars DON'T have 901
               transmissions).

If you want to skip gears on your downshift, your body needs to be
able to perform TEN different downshift operations:

    5th to 4th,
    5th to 3rd,
    5th to 2nd,
    5th to 1st,
    4th to 3rd,
    4th to 2nd,
    4th to 1st,
    3rd to 2nd,
    3rd to 1st,
    2nd to 1st.

And as though that isn't bad enough, consider this...

The length of time you're on the brakes before a corner is directly 
related to the number of gears you have to drop during the downshift.

Think about it... If you're approaching a 2nd-gear corner in 5th
gear, you'll have to brake for a relatively long time, since a
2nd-gear corner is slow by definition and you wouldn't be in 5th
gear on the approach unless you were moving pretty quickly.  On the
other hand, a 4th-gear turn approached in 5th gear requires
relatively little braking. 

See how this works out?  The amount of time you're given in which to
downshift (i.e., the amount of time you're on the brakes) is
more-or-less DETERMINED by the number of downshifts you have to do in 
that time.

Now... Your first reaction to this may be, "So what?  If I can get
the 5-2 shift out of the way quickly, by doing it in one motion
without hitting 4th and 3rd on the way down, that means that I'll be
spending less time (and, therefore, less attention) on the downshift,
so I'll have more of my $10 bill to spend on all those other aspects
of corner-entry."

Well, it'd be nice if that were true -- I mean, a slow corner at the 
end of a fast straight is a GREAT place to pass, and you really do 
need all the attention that you can spare at a corner like that, 
since there's so much going on -- but it just doesn't work that way.

Here's why:

First, you CAN'T shift from 5th to 2nd until your road speed has 
dropped into 2nd-gear range.  This means, obviously, that you have to 
wait to perform the shift until just before corner-entry... Which 
means that while you're braking at the limit of adhesion, protecting 
your line, trying to pass, looking for your brakes-off marker 
and turn-in point, etc., you're ALSO spending your attention waiting 
for the proper moment to begin your 5-2 downshift.

Of course, you can try to simplify (i.e., reduce the attention cost
of) the waiting process by using a reference point on the track that
tells you when to downshift, just as you use reference points to
find your braking and turn-in points, but there's a limit to the
number of markers you can deal with in each turn, so the process
usually becomes a query/response between two little voices in your
head:

    Downshift Angel:  "Excuse me, is it time to downshift yet?"
    Hero Driver:  "No, not yet."

    DA:  How about now?
    HD:  No.

    DA:  Ok... Now?
    HD:  No.

    DA:  Um... Now?
    HD:  No.  Wait a minute... Is that 914 trying to PASS me?!

    DA:  Um...
    HD:  The NERVE of that guy!  He's not even driving a real 
         Porsche!

    DA:  Um....
    HD:  Shut up, I'm concentrating!

    DA:  Um...
    HD:  I'll show him... How do you like THAT, Mr. "Perfect 50-50 
         Weight Distribution", huh?!  Eat my Big Red brake dust!

    DA:  Um...
    HD:  What IS it?  Can't you see that I was busy keeping that
         guy behind me?  Geez... How's a guy supposed to get
         anything done with you tapping my shoulder all the time?

    DA:  Oh, it's nothing... Except that you just overshot your 
         downshift point and now the 914'll drive right by you while 
         you're struggling with the gear lever at the corner exit.

If you ALWAYS downshift sequentially through the gears, the process
is much simpler:  The Downshift Angel doesn't continuously ask you
to sample all your sensory inputs and decide when the time is right
for the downshift; it just TELLS you... You hit the brakes and it
says, "Now. Now. Now."

If everything goes right, both methods put you in the correct gear
for the corner at the correct moment... That is, you take your foot
off the clutch at the same time either way.  The difference is that
-- because your braking time is directly related to the number of
gears you're dropping for the corner -- the sequential-shift method
also puts your foot ON the clutch at the same point relative to 
the start of braking AT EVERY CORNER.

And...

If you skip gears when you downshift, you have to CHOOSE which of
your ten downshift patterns to use, which costs attention.  Your
Downshift Angel says something like, "Hmm... We're in fifth gear,
and we need to be in, um... Second?  Yeah, second... So we need to
execute Downshift Pattern Number 3."

If you downshift sequentially, on the other hand, you don't have to
spend ANY attention on choosing a pattern... Your Downshift Angel
just says, "Shift down. Shift down. Shift down."

Although your hand does need to find the gearshift lever, you don't
really even need to "know" which gear you're in at corner entry...
The single instruction that your Downshift Angel gives ("Shift 
down") is the same no matter WHAT gear you start in; the only 
difference is the number of times it gives that instruction.

Which brings up a related point...

Since braking time is related to the number of gears through which 
you have to shift, you don't even need to "know" HOW MANY gears to 
drop in the braking zone if you shift sequentially... If you've 
picked your braking point properly, you just keep downshifting until 
you're at the brakes-off point.

So.. To summarize:

You want to spend as little attention as possible on downshifting.

To minimize that attention, you need to train your body to perform 
the downshifts as "automatically" as possible.

If you downshift sequentially:

    1.  Your body only needs to learn half as many downshift
        patterns as are required for non-sequential downshifting.

    2.  The timing relationship between braking and downshifting is
        essentially fixed, and so requires practically no attention.

    3.  You spend no attention on choosing which downshift pattern to 
        use.

    4.  You spend very little attention deciding how many gears to 
        drop for a corner.

Oh, and don't forget...

    5.  You get to blip the throttle and hear that great engine sound 
        more often.
