Group:
Several of you inquired about the engine dolly which I am using to support
my SC's engine and tranny assembly.  The fax which I received which
described its dimensions was readable, with the exception of the dimensions
and some of the detail.  So I winged it a bit and came up with a very
suitable device.
Here it is.
It is very simple.  Just a U-shaped frame that rides on casters at each
corner.  Its interior dimension should match the width of your floor jack
(a big 2 1/2 ton job, not the little one you may take to track) so that it
will roll into and out of the U.
Mine is made of 2x4's which I have bolted together to make 4x4's.  The
sides are 24" long.  It is 17" wide at the top.  The gap for the jack (open
end of the U) is 11".  The cross piece of 4x4 at the top should fit between
the sides, not on top of them.  This will allow the frame to better carry
the load.
I reinforced the interior corners of the U with L shaped metal braces which
I screwed into the faux 4x4's.  I reinforced the top with a strip of
galvinized steel angle iron.  I used lag bolts to affix the steel.
The plans from the magazine referenced the use of a flat piece of steel
across the top, but mine is just fine without that piece...
To take the engine and tranny down you just place your jack at a point
between the front of the engine and the drain plug, take the load off of
the mounting bolts, remove the bolts, and then lower and pull back on the
engine which is now balanced on your floor jack.  You have to ease it back
to get the shift rod to clear the tunnel in the car.  As the whole assembly
is lowered it comes to rest on the dolly which has been in place
surrounding the front of your jack.  Part of the front of the engine and
the edges of the heat exchangers should come to rest on the dolly.
Once the engine/tranny is on the dolly you remove the jack, swing it around
to the body in front of the tranny mount area and raise the car a bit more
so the engine will clear the rear valance. Spread the load with some lumber
since this is not an official jacking point.
 Then you pull the dolly with its load and it will roll out from under the
car.  Lower the car back onto your jack stands and you are ready to fiddle
around with the engine/tranny to your heart's content.

I got the swiveling casters which makes moving the dolly around very easy.
Check the load rating on the ones you buy (got mine at Lowe's).

The whole thing cost only a few bucks and made the job very easy (once I
had disconnected the zillion lines etc that are on an SC).  I can now roll
things around to get at them.

Re entry into the engine bay should be relatively simple.  Aligning things
being the obvious critical factor.

Hope this is helpful.  I will be glad to answer anyone's questions on any
detail here.
