Regarding my post on the location of the resistors for varying the speed
of the defroster blower motors Harley in FL wrote:

These may be on the blower assemblies. The two for the fresh air
blower are on the shroud that holds the blower. One would think that
they would be close to the motors--are you sure there is only one set for
both blowers?

In response,
No I'm not sure....but my current flow diagram indicates only one set, and
it makes sense to me there would only be the one set of resistors for
both motors....BTW, last night I found one of the motors had suffered a
complete meltdown.....also in trouble shooting the system I found if I
physically close the relay with my finger the one working fan runs but
the speed doesn't change with different settings of the rotary switch. 
The "Heater Control Relay" in the engine compartment shows evidence
of a previous repair on the printed circuit board on the very terminal that
should provide control voltage to the defroster motor relay located in the
front ...ARGHHH!!  And I still need a set of brushes for the engine
compartment fan (to avoid buying a  $170 motor),  a $167 Control Relay
and now a $165 defroster fan (everytime I call for a price on a part they
give me the same number) ....anyway, thanks for your help.
