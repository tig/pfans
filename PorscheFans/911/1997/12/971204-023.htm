Here's another try at posting my Pro Cooler story.  I Bought an '80
911SC Weissach Edition.  The P.O. made it clear that the A/C hadn't
worked for quite a while, and included an Automotion rotary compressor
upgrade kit in the price of the car.  I was researching the best way to
go about upgrading and received a wide range of information and
suggestions from serveral people.  I read the Pro Cooler add on the
Platz Mall page and was impressed.  I called and talked to Greg, who was
doing the marketing at that time. (August?) He impressed me with his
version of the story, and used the fact that I would have to buy a
receiver/dryer anyway (About $145.00) as a selling point.  Since the
Price of the Pro Cooler (at that time) was $265.00 I figured that it
would be worth the extra money for the improved performance. I next
tried to locate someone to do the job and was quoted prices from $300.00
from someone I decided didn't ask enough questions to $3,000.00 from
someone who thought I needed to replace everything but the windows.
	The P.O. had taken the car to Kahler's in Dublin, CA for seven years
prior to my purchase, and when I had the car gone over extensively by a
dealership service department they couldn't find a thing that it needed,
so I figured that was a GLOWING endorsement of Kahler's.  Denny Kahler
listened to the Pro Cooler story, asked that I fax him a copy of the
installation instructions to enable him to give me a more accurate
estimate.  He worked up a price in the $350.00 to $500.00 range
depending on what coolant we used, and how much harder than replacing
the receiver/dryer installing the Pro Cooler would be.  He made the
unique suggestion that he had to look at the other existing components
before he would say anything else needed to be replaced!
	He inspired confidence so the car went to Kahler's for a couple of
days.  The bracket for the Automotion kit looked wrong, and the belt was
the wrong size for the pulley on the car AND on the Automotion Sanden
compressor.  Denny called and suggested it would be a good idea to get
the proper bracket and belt, or the belt wouln't run true.  We both
called Automotion and got some help, but the end result was that "They
are all like that."  Denny offer to install as is, or fabricate a better
bracket and get the bigger belt.  I told him to do what he would do if
HE was going to drive it, and he said new bracket, new belt and R-134
was chosen as the coolant du Jour.
	We agreed on some additional money for the bracket/belt, and the job
went forward.  The Pro Cooler is a good bit bigger around than the
receiver/dryer it replaces, Denny was concerned about clearance.  The
unit touches the tire under " full left lock" if the car is moving.) 
Denny said the vent temperature was 48 degrees, and that was about what
the stock units produce.
	I picked the car up at Kahler's (Bay Area) and drove across the central
valley to my home in the Sierras (120 miles).  The outside temperature
was 90-95.  The A/C ran all the way home without shutting off, and it
never got what I would call cold inside.  Once home I left it on full
blast (after confirming the switch/fan settings from a posting I'd
saved) and got a vent temperature of 48 degrees in an 80 degree garage.
	I called Denny the next day and said that since the add for the Sanden
compressor mentioned a 20% gain in performance, the the Pro Cooler said
the it reduced the vent temperature 20 degrees, it should have been 19
degrees in the car by the time I got home. He said he was sure they had
followed the directions and it looked like that was all I was going to
get.  He mentioned putting a vent in the bulkhead under the dash would
probably help.
	I called Pro Cooler and talked to Ron, the owner/inventor. He said that
the problem was probably that Kahler's put in too much coolant.  I asked
him to call Denny and touch base, which he said he would do.  I then
called Denny and told him what Ron had said.  Denny was polite but
adamant that he had measured the coolant exactly (very) with the specs
provided.  I asked him to call Ron, he did, got no call back.  I called
Ron once again asking him to talk to Denny, as of the last time I
checked in, Denny reported no call.
	To make a long story as short as possible, it got cold and I quit using
the A/C much.  It gets cool, but the 10 year old unserviced A/C in my
Montero (can you say Chrysler AirTemp?) is still much colder than the
Porsche with new Pro Cooler/Sanden rotary compressor.
	Altogether (counting P.O.'s compressor money) the job cost in the
$1500.00 range.  It sure wasn't very damned cold in the car.  At this
time I would have to say "Kahler's, si ! ! !"  and "Pro Cooler, NO ! !
!)
	If I had it to do over, I'd go stock all the way and put in the
bulkhead vent.  I know this is long, but I got 15 requests for the
details again.  Thanks for the patience of those with newer, cold A/C !
