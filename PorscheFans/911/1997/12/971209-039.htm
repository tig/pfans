Thanks to everyone for the help finding and evaluating a middle-aged =
911.  The advice and information here was much better than anything I =
could find to read - I received 26 responses to my earlier post.  I =
tried to follow up with everyone, but forgive me if I missed responding =
to you - your advice was appreciated.

I looked at 14 cars, but the one I bought was the one I mentioned here =
on the net a few weeks ago - I just didn't see a nicer one that I could =
afford.  I bought a 1983 Euro SC with 126k miles that is in original and =
near perfect condition.

Thanks to everyone!
