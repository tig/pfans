$11,500 seems outrageous.  I repainted my '68 912 2 yrs ago.  I
dismantled everything, stripped to metal, body prep, primed, and
delivered to the best painter in town and he shot the color, then I
reassembled everything including doors, hoods, glass, rubber and trim.
After doing all this, I'd say that the strip and prep was the biggest
effort by far.  If I had to do it again, I'd have the car media blasted
at about $400-500.  Assuming no major damage, the prep after the strip
might take a pro say 60 hours, prime/paint at 16 hours, final polish at
16 hours, and then you reassemble everything.  So, you have:

Strip  					$500
Prep 60@$50			$3000
Paint/Finish 32@$50	$1600
Paint Materials			$500
	Total              		$5600				

Keep in mind, I'm not a painter, but this indicates to me that $6000 is
the approximte number, unless your car is really hurting.  Here's some
observations:

1.  The only reason my painter did my car was that I delivered it ready
to shoot.  He said he makes a lot more doing insurance repairs, and
couldn't afford to mess with the large effort of a restoration.  This
may be what's really driving the cost with your shop.

2. Try to find someone that will take a special interest in your
project.  Whether he just loves old p-cars or will use your car to show
off his best work for word-of-mouth marketing, the end result is a
better job.

3. If you are able, do as much of the crap work as possible and leave
the truly skilled tasks to the pros.  This may significantly reduce the
cost of the painter's fee.  In my case, the painter charged about $1000
labor/materials to shoot the Polo Red.  Sounds great, doesn't it?  A
warning:  I worked my ass off prepping the car.  But, all-in-all it was
a great experience, and I really got to know my car.

Hopefully, I've given you something to think about.
