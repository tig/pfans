Hi all,

Since I posted that my car was stolen I figured I might as well post
that it was found. 
Since I have too much time on my hands I put together a list of damage
for those morbid folks who may be interested.
The Insurance people will look at it by Friday, I will post what
happens. I would be quite surprised if it's not a total.
