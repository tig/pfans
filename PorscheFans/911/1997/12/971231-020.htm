Hi Thomas.  If you could get a small tube-type sub and set it behind the front
seats on the floor or on top of the rear seats (folded).  I use an 8" Kicker
box I bought and just have it sitting on top of the rear seats which I never
use.  You can get the tube subs with built in amps if you don't have anything
to power it.  When I need the space it's pretty easy to remove also.

Also if you want something more permenant without losing the rear seats, I
came across this site without someones P-car:

That is a very extensive system but you might be able to use some things from
it.

Happy New Year,
