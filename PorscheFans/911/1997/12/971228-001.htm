Re John Watson's question about 205/60 on 15x6 rims, that's what I'm
running and he's generally right--the size fits. 

BUT it's not guaranteed that you won't rub.  The closest of today's
sizes to the OE 185/70 is the 195/65 that Yokohama makes on the AVS and
008P tires; in fact, it was created with narrow-bodied Porsches in
mind.  You can't get that size in R compound, however (and with the new
032 you can't even get the 205/60. 

My car is lowered and cambered and the inside edges of my fronts graze
the inside wheel well slightly when turned all the way in either
direction.  That much, people tell me, is normal.

But you can also catch the fender lip, depending on car setup and tire
manufacturer; I've seen it happen on stock 911s with 205/60 and it
messes up both the tire and the fender.  Tires differ in actual size
from company to company--for example Comp T/A's are just a bit trimmer
than Yokohamas.

For insurance, I'd have my front fenders rolled (a baseball bat is a
favorite tool).  An experienced person can often do this with no paint
damage, and it doesn't show from the outside.  I wouldn't try it at
home, however, unless I had a lot of practice.
