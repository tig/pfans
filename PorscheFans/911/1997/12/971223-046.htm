I'd do the standard things like have a leak-down test done even though with the miles it shouldn't need one.  Check to see if it's had the cam chain tensioner update done, if it hasn't plan on doing it.  Check the cam oil lines and the turbo oil line.

I just sold my 1980 930 and really miss it (need replacement soon).  The car was a blast to drive, but mine had a harsh suspension that got old on long trips.  When I bought it I never thought it would bother me.  Mine was a 300+ HP Euro-version which was lower, and stiffer.  Great fun but not a daily driver.

I felt my car was reliable and not bad to keep running.  Where it ran into money was fixing the items that the previous owner had neglected or screwed up.  It is expensive to repair, but not bad to maintain.  Have it checked out by a good mechanic.

My two cents worth,
