I have a tow bar like the one that Chip Evaul speaks of. on mine I also
bolted it to the pan and ran two steel bars from there back to the
mounting points for the steering box. My only problem was taht I had to
raise the front end to tow it and then reset it when I got to the race
track, so I got a trailer.
