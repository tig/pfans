John,

There could be many reasons for this.  One reason is particulary nasty.  Your ball joints may be worn out.  It they are worn enough and you hit a bump hard enough, they could separate while you are driving with all the bad results you can think of.  Another symptom is that when you've hit a bump on a curve and the car comes back down on the suspension, the steering wheel will jerk in your hands.

Fortunately, they are easy to check.  Jack up the front of the car so the wheels are in the air and try and wiggle the tires by grasping the bottom and pushing in and out.  Any movement should be checked out more throughly.  (Check your wheel bearings for tightness.  They can be a source of wiggle.)

Remember that the ball joint can be fairly difficult to move by hand even when it is worn out.  I thought mine were okay, but decided to change them anyway.  When I had the new ones in hand, I immediately saw the difference between old and new.
