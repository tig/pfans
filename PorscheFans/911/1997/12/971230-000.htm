Hi Greg,


>Last week I got myself an early Christmas present: the 7" H4's that
>replace the standard sealed beam.  Replacement took about 10 minutes and=

>Questions:

>1. The Hella spec calls for the upper horizontal cut-off of the beam to

I think what they mean; the 100mm is below the center height of lamp
when car is backed up 10m.

An easy way to adjust the lights is following;
A. Park car on level surface lights on close to a wall.
B. Mark the corner of horisontal and upward slope of light beam on
    the wall. Car is as close as possible to wall.
C. Back car straight for about 5m (16,4ft)
D. The corner of projected light should be now about 5cm (2in)lower =

    than the mark when car against the wall. Rule of thumb, 1cm per 1m
    should light point down.

>2. From the center of the each headlight projection, the upper cut-off
>slopes up to the right at a 30 degree angle.  For the motorcycle, there

If You followed above instructions, You create an asymmetric beam of
light, the beam is longer on your lane than on the oncoming lane.
Remember that for to me unknown reasons US cars use symmetric
headlight that give a blob of light in front and Euro use asymmetric that=
 =

give a longer beam in front and a shorter one on oncoming lane.
Do not toe in or out the light, the light slope up should stay in same =

vertical place when You back up the car, straight and level surface.

>Details, details.  I guess I couldn't be happy with spending only $85 to=

>improve the lighting by 90%.  Now, I'll spend 2 weeks obsessing about
>the adjustment trying to get the last 10%.  Does anyone else get accused=

>of being a compulsive-obsessive?...... I thought so.  Happy Holidays! =


Driving in a country with most roads are 2-lane it is quite important to
have the
lights adjusted correctly. Lot of cars have the nose full of lights and y=
ou
go and blind them with your lights and they return with a couple hundred =
W.
Surely You noticed that in US when driving in traffic, You have to adjust=

rear
mirror as the lights from behind blind You, not so in Europe because of =

asymmetric lights.

If this sound confusing, send me a note and I try to clarify my wording.

Happy New Year!
