Ray,

There was a long ferverent discussion about mounting a 5 or 6 point harness
and drilling holes or not, over the last month or two on this list. Take a
look at the archive. I've mounted a 5 point harness in a 91 C4, and a 6
point harness in a 97 C4S. Both cars have a Brey Krause harness bar and
work with the factory seat. Here's what I've learned from this. You can
attach the harness and still have use of your factory belts if you use eye
bolts in place of the factory mount bolts. You probably should deal with
this in 2 parts: the 4 point harness and the submarine belt (1 or 2 point)
which adds up to 5 or 6 belts.

First, lets deal with the 4 points for the shoulder and seat belts. You
should not attach the shoulder harness to the harness bar (see BK web
page), instead thread it through the loops on the bar and attach to the
bolts for the rear seat belt. The seat belt harness can attach to the
factory seat belt bolt holes. But the inside one is tough to reach without
removing the seat, so I've had an eye bolt attached to the tunnel behind
the seat. Have someone experienced do this hole. Then you just clip on the
4 point belts.

Second, you have to decide whether you want a 1 or 2 point submarine belt.
For a single sub, just drill a hole in the floor close to the front of the
seat. For a double sub I've added 2 heavy duty clips to the front seat belt
mounting bolts. The 2 point sub belt just clips to these clips.

In summary, 2 holes for a 5 point, and 1 hole for a 6 point. Both work well
for me. If you want to avoid drilling any holes then the 6 point could work
if you can get a special eye bolt for the tunnel side. The 91 964 has more
room around the seat bolts than the 97 993. Don't even consider about
installing only the 4 points. YOU MUST USE A SUBMARINE BELT !

Hope this helps,

97 red 993 C4S
