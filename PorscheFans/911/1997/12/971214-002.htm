Listers,

	Moving over from the 924/44 list for a moment. Please do not throw
sticks and stones, after all 'tis the holiday season. :)

	Needing advice on the Becker CR-201. Radio went out in another car
(MB) and for alot of reasons I think I wish to stay original, meaning
becker. I came across a new unit from an authorized dealer for $359.

	The 201 is not the model that was originally in the car ( I think
this is a porsche specific model) and I do not have any specs on it.
The dealer  will have them monday for me but I was wanting to get
the lists opinion of this particular unit as well. Any advice
offered on this model would be greatly appreciated.

thanks for the time,
