Jim,

No tomato war. You just have not driven against the right competition. An
autocross is a little different than a country road which was your
original statement. Depending on the course, a 912 may have advantage over
a 911T of the same year. However, a stock 912 is, as a rule, not going to
beat a stock 911 at an autocross, a country road, or the big track.
