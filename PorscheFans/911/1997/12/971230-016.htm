>Is there a way to improve (lessen) the time before the lights go out? 

Sure is -- cheap too!  Get up a couple of hours early and start the car.
Then go back to bed again!  

More costly -- move to warmer climate!

Couldn't resist it!

____________________________
I've been running R1's and Yok 008 RS's on the street for 10 years, and
have had very few failures.  I run them at 28 lbs in the front and 30 in the
rear, which has never caused any "groove of doom" problems, or any
others, for that matter.  Further, my pyrometer at the track tells me that
those pressure work pretty well.
_______________________

I must admit I have had nothing but R1s on my car for at least
the last 5 years but I put VERY little street mileage on 
my car (I have about 4-5 sets of mounted Fuchs wheels
with various size/compound R1s for track and autocross). 
I must say however that running R1s on the street
is not a good idea. You may have "few" failures
but any failure on the street or damage to a good race
tire with tread still left is NG. Several people on Team.net
(autocross list) have had problems driving on their R1s
to and from events. Better to save the tires for competition
and carry a spare set for the street. 

P.S. Police officers have very little patience for your
excuse that "the tires come with the outside-half bald and 
not much tread anywhere" and are just looking for ways
to give Porsche owners tickets. I even got grief from tech
inspectors at the drag strip who wanted to send me home
as my R1s were "worn out!!!!"
