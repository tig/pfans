In reference to my previous post on this, my fuel gauge was working
properly, but the low fuel warning light was inoperative. 

I disassembled the fuel tank sending unit today. I could not find
anything obviously wrong, all the circuits appeared to be complete, and
the guide wires were clean and straight. However, the low fuel warning
light circuit did not close when the float was at the bottom (still open
between black and brown wire terminals). Fortunately, my wrench had
provided a new sender to use if needed, so I was able to compare it.

I cleaned all of the contacts with electrical contact cleaner, and then
the low fuel warning circuit worked OK--must have been some corrosion on
the contacts.
