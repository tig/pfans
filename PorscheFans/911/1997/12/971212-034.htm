Hi Jeff,
Sounds like a defective sender. I just had mine apart to fix the low
fuel warning light (Don't ask how I found out it was defective). It is
under the carpet in the trunk, on top of the tank. It is retained by
five 5mm nuts and spring washers. After you remove them, it just lifts
out. Have a fire extinguisher handy, and be prepared to deal with about
a pint of gas which the sender will leak out. You also might want to
have a fresh gasket handy.

To disassemble the sender, straighten the little brass lock washer on
the tiny nut on the bottom of the sender, and unscrew the nut. Then you
can pull the aluminum cylindrical part off, and see the inside. Be
careful, it is rather delicate. There are two vertical resistance wires,
upon which the float rides, and which send current to the gauge which
translates that into a status reading. Some others on the net said that
these wires get corroded. You might try cleaning them with some
non-abrasive cleaner (lacquer thinner?).

In may case, I didn't see any corrosion, but I cleaned everything with
electrical contact cleaner, and it tested OK. A friend of mine said it
was probably "microscopic corrosion".
