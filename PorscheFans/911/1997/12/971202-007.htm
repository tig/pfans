5th --> 2nd...

Seems to me there'd be some serious "lag time" ... Let's say
your at 5000 RPM in 5th.... to go to 2nd at a similar RPM,
you'd have to brake from about 120mph to 55 mph in about the
time it would take to perform the shift. Now THAT is some serious
braking. I'd guess that most of our vehicles won't brake as
fast as we can execute that shift... so there's that "lag time",
the point where, if something goes wrong, you're in no gear,
braking furiously, waiting to hit 2nd. I think for maximum
control you'd want to go from 5th to 3rd to 2nd, and hope you don't
hit 1st...  Of course, this is all theory. If I tried a 5th --> 2nd
with my clutch and transmission and under maximum braking, *boom*.
