Hi Pfans.

I just had to throw in my $.02 worth.  I feel somewhat left out of it
all. I have no immediate problems to request help with, no jerks in
paint shops or dealerships to fight with, no thiefs that have stolen my
car and totally trashed it, I'm not looking for seats or
cheeseheads and my torsion bars work fine regardless of who invented
them first or who installed them on a car first-thank you.  My 85 911 is
in it's winter storage spot, washed, waxed,
fresh oil and air, covered and snug.  It ran fine when I put it to bed
for the winter.  (Minnesota, don'tya know ?).   I read the list daily
and wonder at the "problems" people have with their cars.  I am thankful
that the PO had a valve job done, clutch and synchros replaced, Konis,
Weltmeister stuff and virtually everything that needed to be taken care
of had been, even new rotors the day before I picked it up.  I love
driving it. 8)   I just wanted to let everyone know that, for every
problem on the list, there have to be 200+ cars that are running
perfectly.   Great cars, great people.

Cheers 

Wayne

P.S.  Thanks Ross
