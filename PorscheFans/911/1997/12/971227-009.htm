I absolutely agree! (add 911 and 964 to 993). This is not a retro mental
habit, sic et simpliciter the reasons behind the 911 project are not more
market winners (at least for the sales target established by the Porsche
management, i.e. for an independent sportscar company). Could you find, in
the next years, the same close relations between a GT1 and a 996 that you
could find between a stock 911 and the Elford-Stone Montecarlo car, or
between a 964 turbo and the Haywood 911 IMSA? I don't believe so. The world
in 1963 was very different from the present and so the present cars from
the 1963 cars. For that reason I'll take care of my 964 turbo for ever.

I own a 76 911s targa and have a terrific set of stock Fuchs.  My question is
this: What is the maximum width wheel I can run at front and rear of the car?
I would also need to know what wheels I can look for from other porsche cars.
I do not want to add flairs to my car.  I am also in the market for some sport
seats or a racing bucket if any one out there has one at a little better than
fair market price. I do not want to buy a seat in need of new upholstery.
Thanks in advance.

At Trackside Products in San Diego, we've sold many R1's and AO32's for street
or street/track use. Pat Norris, a 944 driver, just ran the Starlight Rally, a
12-hour overnight rally from Santa Barbara to Las Vegas, on a set of A032's.
He was extremely happy. Although a little noisy, the grip was fantastic. One
point he was stopped on a patch of black ice. There were SUV's in front and
behind him. The road was a little off camber. When the line of traffic started
to move, both the SUV's slid sideways into the ditch on the side of the road
(no damage). His 944 slid a tad sideways and just drove off the ice. He's very
happy.

The AO32 looks like a better rain tire. I've had several people (including
myself) who like the R1 in the rain. I personally haven't driven the AO32 in
wet, but my customers are very happy. Comparison between the two in the wet? I
don't know. My gut says the AO32 is a better compromise tire.

As far as running tires on both street and track..... I used to wear out my
A009RS's on the outside edges (it was a compromise street/track suspension
setting). On the street the wear was more in the center of the tire. I enjoyed
the stick of the "R" tires around town and also enjoyed not changing tires two
to four times a month. Maybe I'm just lazy though.....

a friend of mine had the pleasure of a german vacation that included a twin
turbo rental. the company that procurred the rental was not an AVIS or Hertz.
If Michael Russel wants my friends name and phone number please email me
direrct and I'll hook you up with him.

Also, I understand Porsche is putting together tour packages that include car
rental. I've received several newsletters from Porsche AG on the subject. They
have a "Travel Club" magazine. I can't remember her last name, but her first
name is 
Stella, she took Ilse Nadle's place as Car Club Rep for Porsche AG last year.
She authors the magazine I saw the info in.

I hope that helps
