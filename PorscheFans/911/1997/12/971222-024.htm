All do-it-yourself engine rebuilders:

911 engines have 8 main bearings:  a thrust bearing (which has flanges
on its sides, and is the #1 bearing), 6 regular bearings (look like rod
bearings, just a little bigger), and the #8 bearing (Automotion calls it the
"nose bearing").  Bearings 1-7 are two piece bearings.  When you
purchase a bearing set you get bearings 1-7. 

#8 doesn't look at all like the others - it is a one piece aluminum (at least
that is what it looks like) bearing, a thick walled cylinder with a hole in the
middle, and is held in place against rotation not with tangs but with a pin
(the getting of which into its hole in the bearing when installing the crank
is one of the "think hard about this" critical stages of putting  your case
back together).  The crank pulley seal goes into one end of this bearing,
and it has an O ring around its outside.  But a bearing it is.  It supports the
intermediate shaft gear between it and the #7 main.  It is also the second
place where the oil for the rods enters the crank.  

And #8 doesn't come with the bearing sets, at least none that I have
purchased.  It is an extra $90 or so.  The reason for this is that it is
normally reused, because it doesn't get much wear.  Which is why you
don't want to have that bearing surface on your crank ground, or that
bearing face on your case bored, unless something is really barfed up.

Main bearings come in undersizes (to accomodate crank grinding) and
oversizes (to accomodate case align boring, although neither Automotion
nor Tweeks show this in their 911 bearing listings), and combinations of
the two - you might want a first under/first over set, or a second
under/first over set.  I don't think all possibilities are available.  And things
start to get more expensive with the oversizes.  But the #8 is what you
least want to have be anything other than standard/standard (first
under/standard mains seem actually to be cheaper!).

I was pondering all this while pulling and inspecting the bearings in my
3.0.  The bottom end, by the way, looked fine, I could probably have left it
alone.  It was the four broken top compression rings which probably had
something to do with the loss of power which led to the teardown.

Anyway, back to my words of expensively acquired (from a machinist
who said I shouldn't have had that done) wisdom - don't have the #8
align bored just because you are having the rest of the bores bored.  In
my case I thought align boring was indicated because I had had the #3
spigot lip of a mag case welded and them machined to repair damage
from a rod incident to head of a valve breaking off (which caused
cylinder to shatter, letting the rod loose).  

A more general statement might be, don't have the other case bearing
bores align bored if you don't have to.  And if you do, see if the machine
shop can shave the case so that the resulting bores are back to
standard size, rather than an oversize.

discredit, mostly on race engines, than he likes to think about)
