Randy,
Since a lot of people have been asking about my upgrades I will post
everything that I've done to the 930 so far.

1979 Porsche 930 Upgrades:
Lloyd Design custom embroidered =93turbo=94 2-piece floormat set (black w=
/
yellow)
Kinesis K20 3 piece mesh  rims 17 x 10r, 17 x 9f w/ Porsche crest center
caps
European taillights
1+ Bar adjustable boost system
2.0 Bar VDO Boost gauge (clock replacement) w/ deluxe hose kit
Professionally lowered to Euro specifications
Factory 3rd brakelight installed on whale tail
Bosch H4 headlights
Sachs light sport clutch w/ aluminium light sport pressure plate &
spacer, TO =

   bearing extension & RSR clutch disc (new pilot bearing/crankshaft
seal &
   press plate bolts)
New 930 flywheel
All new Porsche OE cross drilled rotors
All new Pagid street/competition compound brake pads
SS brake lines
Nology Performance HotWires
Bosch Platinum spark plugs
B & B custom made 930 headers w/ heat
B & B custom made dual outlet 930 muffler w/ 4=94 tips


The car runs like you would not believe.  It starts instantaneously all
the time and man what a rush when the turbo spools up!  The headers were
a great investment, although I probably wouldn't recommend the dual
outlet muffler as it resonates pretty badly around 70 mph in 4th gear. =

Turn up the radio and you can't hear it though.  Can't really say that
I've noticed any flames since installing the headers, but I've also
never been behind my car when it's being driven.  Kind of selfish not to
sahre huh?  Noone has said anything though.  Will have to check it out. =

If anyone has any questions please feel free to write.  And thanks to
everyone who wrote me back about my tach problem.  Hopefully I'll get it
sorted out soon.
Brian Buxton
