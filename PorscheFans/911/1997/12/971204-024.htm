You can build one yourself very easily if you have a spare cap.
Basically go down to your local plumbing store and get an appropriate
fitting (I use a 1/4-3/8 bushing), drill a hole in the spare cap so that
the bushing goes through and then thread on an air coupler (I use Milton
couplers on my compressor which fits on the 3/8 pipe thread of the
bushing). Then you just connect your air hose and voila.......pressure..

2 watchouts though, first of all, make sure your air supply is somewhere
in the vicinity of 25 psi, you'd hate to blow things out, second, make
sure that you plug the overflow line which goes out of the back of the
reservoir...........

PS I have also heard you can get a tire valve stem (ie off of a car
tire) and then drill a hole so that it fits as it would in a wheel.
You'd have to find some way to keep  the pressure fitting on it
though.........

Henry,

I've used POR15 on my 911 and think it is great stuff.  I had some battery
acid damage in my trunk and in the front suspension pan, and POR was
recommended to me by a friend that restores older domestic cars.  I stripped
off the rubber undercoat with a wire brush on a grinder, then painted on the
POR.

As per the instructions with the paint, you have to prime it while the paint
is still tacky, or nothing will stick to it.  Also, you have to put some
plastic between the lid and the can or it will weld itself shut.

Check out some of the photos of the paint on my website at:
http://members.aol.com/jhelgesen/johnpage.html
or for AOL people <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/jhelgesen/johnpage.html">
JHelgesen's Home Page</A> 

There's also a link to my garage sale page, http://www.formex.com/garage.htm
Send me a list of parts and your email address and I'll put you on the page.

Later,
John Helgesen
