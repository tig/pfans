Fred - Up should be on, down off.  If you can disconnect the actuating
rod from the servo to the lever, the lever should close itself (the springs
back at the valves just in front of the engine pull the valve shut) and you
shouldn't get any heat.   If it won't close itself, there is a mechanical bind
somewhere, and back by the valves is the most likely place.  Or it is
mal-adjusted back there so half on is actually full off, though that doesn't
sound right since you are getting heat.  The adjustments are separate for
each valve, though, so one could be fully closed and another partly
open.

A temporary fall-back to cut all heat off would be to block off the air from
the engine fan so it can't blow through the heater blower.  I'd just pull the
plastic tube from the engine shrouding, put something pliable but sturdy
(like maybe a heavy plastic bag like a zip loc bag) over the opening, and
put the tube back on to hold it in place.  This assumes that because of a
dead control none of the heater fans come on, so you don't need to
disconnect them.
