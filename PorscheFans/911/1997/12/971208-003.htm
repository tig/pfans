Oh if only it were that simple!!!!
 
I think we'd all chip in to purchase new, reliable software to run the list.
The problem is that there is no ongoing list administration for the PFans
lists. None. It's great that we're getting a free service here, but to
be frank, we're getting exactly what we've paid for.
 
This particular "repeat message" problem has happened time and time again
over the past year or more - not to mention the other main problem we have
where the server conveniently loses the list of subscribers (this has happened
at least 4 or 5 times in recent memory).
 
I'm sure getting frustrated by this. I can't see that we will get better
service with the current administration... though it's hard to fault them
because they're providing the service for nothing.
 
No, the only way we can improve the situation is to move the lists elsewhere.
 
Cheers,
 
Ross
