Thanks to all who provided answers to my oil capacity question.  I did get
a dipstick and am comfortable that I now know how much oil to keep in the
car.  Also, I was quite happy to find out that my oil level gauge is fairly
accurate.  

I have a few things to take care of to get the car sorted.   

First, What are the safe points at which to put jackstands?  I probably
should have asked this before jacking the car up, but currently I have jack
stands supporting the rear of the car under the protruding (about 5 inches)
of the swing arm connectors.  These are solid, round pieces that almost
look like the ends of a rear axle on a front wheel drive car.  It seems to
be an area that holds a lot of weight when the car is on the ground so it
seemed like a logical choice.

Second, I have a squeak coming from one of these round pivot points in the
rear, any ideas as to what it is and how to repair it?

Third, I hear a lot of wind noise when I'm driving above about 40 MPH.  I
think it is coming from the front windshield area.  Is this something I can
eliminate or is this something I need to live with?
