Like Henry Watts, I am waiting with interest to hear an explanation as to
why it is useful on a race track to downshift through the gears, instead
of just putting it in the lower gear you want (with suitable heel and toe
double clutching/blipping) just before you need power again.  Truck
drivers go down through the gears in the mountains because their
brakes are inadequate and they need compression braking.  Plus, they
are not trying to go as fast as possible.  Our brakes, as was pointed out
to me by a local hotshoe early in my Porsche driving, are not inadequate. 
And on a track we are maximizing speed.

Maybe endurance racers, however, try to spare the brakes as much as
they can?  I am doubtful of this semi-coasting rationale, though.  The
Formula 1 cars all seem now to have sequential gear boxes, and it
appears toggling through the gears is needed to get to the one you want.
I've never had the pleasure of using a Hewland type "crash box," but
nothing in their dog ring construction points to any value in sequential
downshifting - as Brad Marker points out, matching is matching.
 
So color me 2-5.  It is a whole lot easier, lets you concentrate on staying
on the edge of the friction circle, and shift only once at the last instant
just before you need power, when you stress things least (and usually
you are stressed least), minimizes brake bias disruption, and if there are
any drawbacks they are not apparent (although downshifting through
the gears sounds neat to the crowd).  With increasing skill and
experience, the "housekeeping" chores of high performance driving
become second nature, freeing the mind for more important stuff, and
shifting is one of those chores.  But it seems like it is only a chore. 

Think of a decreasing radius corner, where ideally you want to slow just
enough in each portion of it to lower your cornering speed to what the
new shorter radius can handle (scrubbing off speed, if you will).  Why
would you want to downshift anywhere other than at the very end
when you finally needed real power for the exit?

If the pros all actually downshift 5-4-3-2 routinely, there must be some
benefit, but what?
