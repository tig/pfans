I have a 1973 911T.  I have purchased a set of new SS heat exchangers (HE)
to replace the original (rusted) steel ones.  I would like some advise from
any of you concerning the removal of the original HE.  I am not sure of the
best method to remove these old nuts.  I have been advised that removing
these can lead to broken exhaust head studs.  Should I heat up the nuts and
studs with a torch to a red color and or should I use some type of
penetrating oil?  I have both 'Liquid Wrench' and 'PB Penetrating
Catalyst'.  

The place I purchased the HE from advised me to remove the engine, put it
on an engine stand and turn it upside down with the idea that the nuts
would be more accessible and thus less likely to break the studs.  This
seems like a lot of work, but if it is necessary, than so be it.

I appreciate any advice you all can give me on this, I have never done this
before, and if any of you can save me time, scrapped knuckles, and an
interesting learning experience this would be great.
