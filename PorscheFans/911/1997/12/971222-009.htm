My information is very dated, I attended the race from 1982 through 
1985 while stationed in Frankfurt Germany.  The race is usually the 
second weekend in June, but changes due to European racing conflicts. 
 Hotel reservations are probably already getting tight.  There is day 
and night practice on Thursday before the race and generally no formal 
activities on Friday.  The track is at the northern edge of the 
chateau region of France, so there are other things to see while you 
are there.  The Germany Region of PCA usually has a group which camps 
at the track during the weekend, hosting a party on Friday night.  If 
you're a member of PCA, look in your March Pano and contact one of 
their officers for some up to date information on the race.  We 
generally purchased general admission ticket plus a pass to the 
welcome area at the end of the pits.  The welcome area was worth the 
price for clean restrooms and lukewarm versus hot beer.  In 1985, I 
represented a local German magazine and got a press pass.  It was 
great to have pretty much unlimited access to the track and pits.  I 
would look for any way I could to get press credentials.   Finally, 
any fluency in French that you can muster will get you farther than 
just about anything else you could do.
Good luck!
