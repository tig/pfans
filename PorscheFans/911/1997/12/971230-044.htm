Chet,
I just went through this about a month ago.  It was
a relatively easy project.  The leaking seals are 
just o-rings that press into the head and crankcase.
I haven't had a single drop of oil leak since the replacement.

Here's the process I followed:
-- Purchase the telescopic replacement tubes.  (I got
all 4.  Figured as long as I was at it I'd replace them
all.)  I got mine from Imparts for about $20 each.
-- Drain all the oil.
-- Crush and yank the old tubes out.  They're light
sheet-metal tubes.  No problem removing.
-- Put a light layer of silicone grease on the new
seals.
-- Pop the new tubes into place and snap the 
lock ring.  This was the trickest step but with
patience it worked out.  You'll know when the
tube is seated because it won't go in any deeper.

Happy New Year,
               Alan
