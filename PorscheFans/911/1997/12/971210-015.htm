This is a repost since I haven't heard anything from anyone concerning this
raging controversy. :o)  As we all know the list has been having a "little"
problem as of late.  Sorry if this eats up too much bandwidth.

PS.  I did check the archives but no tally on the needed info.  Boy, does
the archive need a search engine or what?  Spent three hours going thru the
digests, day by day, looking for some other info.  Can we expect relief
soon?  I know, just stop paying the list owner and then he'll get the idea
<TIC>.

Repost follows:

"I have just purchased a set of Michelin Pilot SX MXX3s to put on my 76 3
Liter Carrera.  The tires I have been running are 205 and 225/50-15s.  The
spec book for my car calls for 29 psi front and 34 rear.  The new tires are
205/55-16 front and 245/45-16 rear.

<<<<Anyone have any idea of where to start out with tire pressures.  The
newer
P-cars with these tires run up to 44 psi in the rears.    Should I just
stick with the pressures specified in the owners manual or are there better
pressures that I should start with?  The problem is an old car with new tire
technology installed.  I plan to run these tires on the street only, but
still driven like a Porsche don't cha know!  I plan to use the 15" wheels on
the track (autocross mostly) with racing tires.  I'll figure out the
pressures for the track later.>>>>>>
