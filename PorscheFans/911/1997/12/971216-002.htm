Re Robert Garrett's question on redoing the a/c in his SC, my
understanding that to convert to R134a requires barrier hoses and a new
receiver-drier.

When I had Performance Aire (in Anaheim) redo an aftermarket A/C on my
car in 7/95, they were still using Freon (R12). Just recently, the owner
of a local a/c shop who's done work for me and whose opinion I respect
tells me that conversion not yet an absolute necessity. A recharge with
the new stuff doesn't cost that much less than with Freon. And if it's
cooling you're after, R134A just doesn't do the job as well. If you're
going to replace hoses, by all means go to the new type hoses, so if you
eventually have to convert to 134A you won't have to replace them again.

You'll need two condensers--one under the car and one in the decklid--to
do a decent job. From my experience, I'd trust what Performance Aire
sells--my unit works beautifully, as I've mentioned on the list several
times.
