Has anyone had experience with buying the dials that NR sells for the
993 Cab.  I am thinking to buy them in alum.  I would appreciate anyone
who has purshased these, and can give me some feedback...

Also, if possible what about installation? Easy? Difficult? Cost, if
done by a dealer? Here is an a bit of their ad on the net:
"NR Automobile Accessories has been producing colored gauge face dials
since 1986. We manufacture to ISO 9000 and OEM specs using the latest
computer technology."  They are at: http://www.nrauto.com/.

If anyone of you has them, and resides in the St. Paul MN area, or
Charleston SC area, I would love to see them as installed to make my
decision easier.  Thanks.  Steve Hubbard

<< All-
      
      I am seeking information regarding Driving Schools for Porsche 911 
      enthusiasts.  I live in the Northeast US (about an hour from 
      Philadelphia) and am interested in participating in a driving school 
      in 1998. 
      
      Thanks >>

Hi, your best bet is to join the PCA if you haven't already.  As a member you
will get local & national newsletters/magazines that have all the info you
need
to begin participating in the PCA drivers ed program.  Your local region would
be Riesentoter, of which I am also a member.  If you wish I could give you 
the phone numbers of some people to contact, or I could answer some 
specific questions.  I am an instructor for 3 local PCA regions for the
driver's 
ed events.

Thanks,

 Fans,
 
 Just as soon as I get one thing fixed, up pops something else.
 
 I tried to do my usual starting of my 911 to circulate the oil this morning
(and to check if my battery has the juice) but when I hit the starter it
wouldn't disengage.  I turned the ignition off and it kept turning.  I tried
turning the key a few times, but it kept turning.  So I jumped out, grabbed a
socket and pulled the negative cable off the battery.  I put the cable back on
after a while and the starter was not turning now.  Put the key in and turned
it, and the starter cranked and stopped when I turned the ignition off.
 
 Any suggestions, selinoid bad on the starter, bad ignition switch.
 
 Thanks for any advice,
 
 John Helgesen
