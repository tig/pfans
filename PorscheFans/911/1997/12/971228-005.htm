I too recently purchased a set of factory manuals from By Design ( a silly
name, but probably ok folks).  they arrived on time and appear to be
complete.  I would say, however, that they appear to be photo copies of
originals.  Maybe that is how they keep the price down...

To the fellow who inquired about Konis, I too replaced by Boges with Koni
adjustables.  They are a PITA to remove, but they are great for those of us
who shift from track to street a few times a year.  you will get good at
it, but it is unnecessarily time consuming.  Koni should make a set that is
adjustable for these cars.  Koni ARE YOU LISTENING?  Is Koni even wired?

To answer or shed light on several questions posed in the last few days:

Stainless steel brake lines are generally not DOT approved, although I've seen
some advertised as 'pending' approval, whatever that means, and others that
don't say whether they are or not.  There are also kevlar ones which usually
are DOT approved.  Does it matter?  I don't know but it's a good idea to
replace the stainless ones every 4 or 5 years.

I don't believe Koni makes rear shocks that are adjustable without removing
them from the car.  You can call a frined, Lee Grimes at Koni, at 606-586-4100
and he should be able to answer most of your shock questions and will probably
even tell you who does make them.

Plug wires are a subject of some controversy.  Several people have reportedly
tested the Nology and other brands of wires against factory ones and found no
difference.  Makes sense to me.  I don't believe all the advertising I see or
read but am still trying to figure out how Prolong gets that engine to run for
500 hours with no oil?  Must be with mirrors.
