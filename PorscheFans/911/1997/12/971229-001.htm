Hi Michael,

  One thing to remember about using a rental car on the Nuerburgring, 
if you trash it, you pay for it. Your insurance that you take out 
with the car is voided if they find out the accident occurred on the 
'ring!!!!

   AVIS rents new 911's here in Germany. Cost is 303.48 DM ($175.42) 
per day, last time I checked. You get 200 km per day free, 1.57 DM 
($.91) per each extra Km (and they add up quickly when you're having 
fun on the 'bahn). Cost is 1517 DM ($876.88) per week, with 1000 km 
free. Same cost for each extra Km. 
   A few EXTRA caveats to rent a Porsche here in Deutschland: FIRST, 
you must be at LEAST 30 years old, you must have had a driver's 
license for at LEAST 5 years, AND last but not least, you must 
have at LEAST 2 major credit cards with you (eg. Amex, Visa, MC, 
Diners or Eurocard). Don't have ALL of the above, NO Porsche for you!
   To contact AVIS here in Germany call this phone number:
    0180-55577    for a reservation. Most of the major cities (Frankfurt, 
Stuttgart, Munich etc) have them available in LIMITED quantities. I'm 
not sure about the Boxster rental though, ask them. 
   The country code for Germany is 49. You might want to contact 
your local operator to get you in touch with the international 
operator to make this a smooth transaction. Almost all AVIS people talk 
English too, so communication should not be a problem. 
   Hope you have a nice trip here.
