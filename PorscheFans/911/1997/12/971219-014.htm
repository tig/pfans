Alan,

I put a Pertronix Ignitor in my '70 911T about four months ago. I 
kept my  original Bosch coil and CD unit. While the instructions did 
not show such an installation, I caled tech support at Pertronix  and they
 gave me proper instructions. The wiring was not the way I would have
expected so it was a good thing I called. The unit has worked 
flawlessly ever since. In fact, I'm very impressed with it.

Perhaps you just got your wires crossed (so to speak). If it's at all 
helpful, I can go look at mine and let you know how I wired it. You 
could then at least confirm that it is the Pertronix unit that is faulty. 
However, I would suspect that since you went through three of these 
it is probably the wiring.

Cheers,

Joel

BTW, I just got boned by Tweeks for out of pocket expense for a rear 
window seal installation. The one they sent was so cheesy that I 
pulled it out immediately and sent it back. They said they wont even 
give me my money back for the seal because it is not in re-sellable 
condition. Frankly, I don't care if they can sell it again or not. 
They never should have sold that piece of junk in the first place!
