I'm one of those people using R1s as street/track tires.  I've been thinking
though, that maybe Yoko A032s might be a better compromise.  The
few people I have talked to that use the Yokos claim that they are decent
track tires (although ultimately not as sticky as R1s) and that they last
a long time (one guy had something like 8 track events on his set and
they looked great).  A Yokohama rep also told me that shaving isn't
required or recommended (I forgot what he said about heat cycling).

The A032s also appear to be able to deal with rain much better than
a shaved R1.

Any comments?  Is anyone actually using A032s?
