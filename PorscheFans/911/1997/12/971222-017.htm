Hey Pfans,

FWIW, the posting about high costs associated with High Performance
House (Rich Bontempi's shop) is completely consistant with my experience.

He uses Automotion for his pricing benchmark even if he didn't
get the parts there.

The place is legit and I have seen quality work.  However,
I always felt on the clock there for everything.... _everything_.

There are some shop owners who make you feel comfortable spending
your money with them, and there are some shop owners who you
feel glad about givinb them your business.  This guy had the
effect on *me* as looking for every possible angle to charge me
and I always had the feeling of being taken advantage of.

There are a lot of other shops out there I would rather do
business with.
