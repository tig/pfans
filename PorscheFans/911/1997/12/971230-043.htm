Thomas,

I own a '97 C4S with 18" Turbo Design Look (or something like that) wheels.
Not the Technology hollow spoke.

I recently needed this info and pulled my wheels to get the real numbers.
My fronts are 52mm and my rears are 40mm.  According to the factory manuals
the offset for the rears on the regular body 993 is 60mm.  The smaller the
number, the wider the track.

The 40mm for the rears is consistent with all sources checked, but a number
of people have quoted me 45mm for the fronts.  I know mine are 52's because
that is what is stamped on the wheel.

There seems to be plenty of room for increasing the track.  I have lowered
my car 30mm (Euro spec springs) and have fitted 15mm wheel spacers all
around.
