"The moving lever part of the outside door handle on my 84 911 broke

assembly, $175 used or $250 new." 

Dan, I had the same problem. The trigger mechanism on my door handle 
broke. I went thru the same search as you. I wound up buying a used 
door handle for $75 from one of the used parts suppliers in the back 
of Excellence magazine. I think it was Parts Heaven, but I'd call 
several and check prices. I took one of the rougher (scratched) units 
he had to get a better price. I just needed the trigger, so I 
disassembled the salvaged part to fix my original handle. The repair 
is pretty easy. Email me if you have any questions.

 Dave, I have had very good luck with a dealer called Hoehn 
 (1-800-984-6346; out in La-La Land).  I get right thru, their stock
 is very good, they're pretty helpful and knowledgeable, shipping
 is good (3-5 days ground UPS from LA to Pgh., PA) - prices
 are very good, too.

 For my other cars, I've managed to find sources for factory parts
 that offer a substantial discount over typical dealer prices.

  Does anyone know of a similar
 source for Porsche 911 parts? There seem to be plenty of excellent
 sources for aftermarket parts but what do you do when you need the
 genuine article?
