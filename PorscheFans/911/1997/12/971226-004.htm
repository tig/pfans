They had a 996 at Champion Porsche last  Wednesday.   Of course being the 
day before Xmas there was no one really there except for one sales person so 
I had lots of time to sit, look,  and play.    That is after the sales 
person pointed it out to me.    I was there since I  had  I had been told 
that they had one,  but I thought it was a Boxster since all I could see was 
a front view.   It looks exactly like a Boxster from the front. 

I think that it looks Japanese both in and out.  The exterior (except in 
Supercup guise) is not an eyecatcher since the lines repeat what we have 
already seen in several other cars.   A Boxster is a better looking car. The 
dash set up is almost identical to my 1988 RX-7 Turbo (beater car) which is 
an improvement  except for the faces of the instruments which are far too 
busy.   You can now change the radio station without fear of crashing and 
you can see the climate control system.   The steering wheel is the same as 
a 993.  No removable cup holders for the a/c vent like the Boxster.

The much ballyhood (sp) rear package shelf is a joke.  You now have three 
separate levels with the larger rear seats down.   Still very little leg 
room for the rear passengers so they should have kept the child's seat which 
was at least useful for us family folks.    Nothing is going to stay put on 
that package shelf.   You also have lost the best place to put rear speakers.

Engine access is a sad joke.   I'm glad I will never change the spark plugs. 
  The trunk is not any bigger than on my 993 and the spare wheel is 
vertical.    The throttle pedal is still hinged at the bottom and heel and 
toeing with a stock set up is impossible.   I was told that this is done 
intentionally to prevent someone from hitting the throttle at the same time 
as the brake.   Why then can I do that in my RX?

The biggest disappointment:   the doors now shut like a Toyota.   The whole 
metal structure lacks the carved from billet feeling of a 911.   It has the 
feel of a cheaper car in the controls and in the moving body parts.   There 
are definite improvements to the performance level,  but who couldn't 
improve on what is essentially a 35 year old (but beloved) design.   As one 
example the position of the front brake caliper has now been moved to aft of 
the front axel and the steering rack has been moved as well.

In case you couldn't tell,  I was not too impressed.  However without 
driving one it is impossible to reach a real conclusion. At this point,  
unless a drive really impresses me,  I think I'll hang on to my 993 for 
another 20 or so years.

Have a great New Year.

Brooks
