I haven't noticed this, but I have an added on factory cooler and thermostat
on my '77 and note that when in between marks between the 80 and 170 deg.
the cooler seems to open either partially or full, somewhat lower than the
176 or so spec.  Does this indicate my thermostat may be out of spec?  I'm
determining it is partially open by the radiator cooler in front right
getting hot, and by the oil level going up, as oil volume has increased, at
least by heat increase, if not additional by thermostat increasing volume.

 Hello ,
 I have a question on engine swaps. I am planning on switching a 2.4 from a
72T out for a 3.2 from an 87.
My question is , are there any webpages with the info? Or maybe it isnt really
very difficult..
The two biggest questions I would have now are: Will the flywheel/clutch assy.
need much changing or will the whole assy from the 72 work? 
 I know the 72 915 is a 225mm flywheel and the 87 3.2 has a 240mm. 

The other question would be about the oil lines, because of the oil tank
location. Will the 72 lines fit, are there lines that fit ,or do i need to
have lines made to fit?
I understand the converstion consists of much much more than just the couple
items ive mentioned.
I really have many more questions , but ill post more later.

Any information would be of great help.
Thank you
 Eric
