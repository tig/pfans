     Hello Pfans:
     
     Please forgive my reposting this message.  I posted this on Dec. 19th 
     and my Digest from that day was a mess; so perhaps you haven't seen 
     this.  I checked the archive for that day and didn't see any 
     additional responses (I got three).  The responses I received talked 
     about leaking valve guide seals and early morning condensation.  I'm 
     going to rule out the condensation, because i live in Seattle and see 
     this all the time.  However, I'm hoping to hear other ideas and/or 
     procedure(s) for testing the seals (short of pulling the heads).
     
     Thanks again.
     
     THE REPOST>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
     
     Yesterday my wife was driving our 78 911 SC.  She called me, at work, 
     and told me the car was burning lots of oil (and the oil level gauge 
     reading was jumping around).  I informed her that the gauge is 
     worthless.  I treat it like an idiot light considering its accuracy. I 
     had her check the dip stick and it said that there was plenty.  She 
     drove it a little more and the smoke went away.  Later, in the 
     evening, while I was driving it started pushing out lots of smoke.  It 
     seemed to last for 5 to 10 seconds after each stop at an intersection. 
     Then it cleared up.
     
     It was dusk, but I'd say the smoke was light in color, but the smell 
     wasn't that heavy of oil.  So I don't want to limit the things I 
     should check out.
     
     Oh mighty gurus of the little German wundercar, please share your 
     infinite wisdom with this unworthy one.
     
     And Merry Christmas to all!
