"Nine14" asked why the PCA club magazine was named "PANAROMA".
The origin of the name of the PCA club magazine goes back to the very
dawn of Porsche itself.
As most Porsche enthusiasts are aware, the very first Porsches were
built in Gmund, Austria, a small farming community near the
Austria/Germany border.  These machines were built only a few years
after the end of WWII, when materials were in short supply, and
manufacturing techniques were not as advanced as they were to
become later.
These first Porsches, which became known as the "Gmund coupes",
were built on a steel floor pan, with  aluminum coupe bodywork.  While
the aluminum body would obviously be impervious to rust, the steel floor
pan presented a daunting rust problem to the design engineers.  The
answer was found by using readily available, but non-conventional rust
proofing materials.  A mixture of cow shit and honey was painted on the
steel floor pan to provide the necessary rust resistance.  This ingenious
solution (no pun intended) carried with it one defining characteristic, a
very distinct odor which rapidly became known as the "Porsche pan
aroma".  PCA chose to capitalize on this characteristic of the first
Porsches when they named their magazine, and "Panaroma" was born.
I certainly wish to thank "Nine14" for posing this important historical
question to the digest.  It is only through the sharing of knowledge of this
type that the Porsche heritage can be maintained.
