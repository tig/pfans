Brian - you ask about injectors seeming loose on your 2.7 CIS engine. 
That was one of the things I noticed in my car.  the injectors themselves
are held in with a rubber O ring, which holds them into a hard plastic
holder, which in turn is staked into the manifold.  At least this is true for
my 77 and 81 engines - I think maybe the earliest (73T?) CIS may have
had a slightly different system.  Typically it is this plastic holder which
seems loose.  For some reason this doesn't seem to be a problem,
except perhaps if the holders come out when you pull the injectors out. 
Vic Lee in Minnesota told me he replaced all of his plastic holders, so you
can get them as parts.  Restake them to keep them in.

Myself, I've always let the plastic parts be (luckily never had one come
out), but replaced the O rings.  The authorities recommend replacing the
O rings (rubber, can harden and allow air leaks, etc).  No one mentions
the plastic holders.  Why air could more easily leak around the O rings
even if old than around a wiggleable holder I don't know.  

Again, I suggest not worrying about this, especially if the engine runs
well.  at least not until you have isolated this as a problem.  You could
isolate by spraying ether or carb cleaner or whatnot into each holder
area one by one with engine idling (highest vacuum) and seeing if revs
picked up (standard induction vacuum leak testing measures).  But more
to the point, if the air/fuel mixture in your engine is OK (measured with an
oxygen sensor or with an HC/CO machine, or whatever) and it starts,
idles, accellerates, and runs fine, plugs look good, etc., who cares.
