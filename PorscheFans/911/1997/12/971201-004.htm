Ok, this bounced twice.  I'll try one more time, then assume the server is
down and wait until tomorrow.  My apologies if this is a duplicate.

Pfans,

Thanks again to all who helped me with my injector problem.  I've really
opened up a can of worms now that I'm doing my own work and I apologize in
advance for flooding you with questions.  :)

Now it's running well, but just doesn't feel as strong as it should be.  In
addition, it stumbles on startup before smoothing out and it never did this
before.  Other than new injectors which I think I'll do anyway (original
ones), any suggestions?  In looking at the old plugs I removed, it seems to
be running a little lean -- they're a whitish color instead of the nice
brown.  These are the Bosch supers, so I don't think they're too hot, and
the replacements are identical.

I'm thinking about adjusting the mixture to see if it runs out better but
my concern is that if I do that, am I just masking the real problem?  I
also know (look out) that the timing has been reduced to 2deg advance by my
former mechanic to combat a fast idle problem.  I'd like to get the timing
back where it should be and fix the real fast idle problem.  Any
suggestions?  Could the two problems be related?

TIA
Mark
