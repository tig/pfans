Hello P-fans, have I got a horror story to tell! I let a relative
drive my baby( must have been too much fruitcake!) and he quickly
returned saying "something's wrong with your clutch". Well I thought the
cable came loose, but no such luck. He destoyed my clutch trying to
smoke the tires in third gear! Of course he denied it, but that's
another story. My wrench put a new clutch on, but now it won't stay in
third, He suggested new sychros 1st, 2nd,and 3rd and flip 4th and 5th
over.
	 I agree, but what upgrades can you do to the 915 tranny, save for a
complete rebuild? I want a close ratio fifth, is this the time to do
it?  Thanks for replies  85 Carrera Targa    MLB
