I have a small shop in San Diego, Trackside Products. We specialize in tires
and parts for Porsches. The Dunlop is one of the most economical "good" tires
we sell. It has been a standard for many years. That it is being discontinued
is a shame. However, another "good" tire for an extremely fair price is the
Bridgestone RE71. I still sell a lot of them.

If, however, you want a tire that will allow you to REALLY appreciate how a
Porsche can feel, the Bridgestone S02 is the best tire I've ever experienced.
Are they expensive? Absolutely! Are they worth the price? That depends on your
budget and how you want to experience your Porshce.

Having had the pleasure of spending a weekend driving a twin turbo in the
Phoenix - Prescott, Arizona area (the car came with the SO2's) I can tell you
that as impressed as I was with the car, I was equally impressed with how well
those tires got that 400 hp to the ground.

I've installed the SO2's to all years of Carrera's. The owners are delighted.
I also heat cycle tires, which really decreases tread wear.

Also, we tend to sell at Tire Rack prices.
