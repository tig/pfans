     Recently I wrote about oil smoke in the cabin from my 73 T during a
hard turn.  Having removed the SSI Heat Exchangers as part of winter
maintenance/storage I have found a large amount of cooked oil on the middle
exhaust pipe of the left exchanger.  There is also a significant oil trail
down the case coming from the inboard end of the oil return tube.

     The oil return tubes are after market and have less than 4000 miles
since they were installed a year ago.  I remember the conversation recently
about 'reseating' the seals but I also remember some conversation about a
difference between green and red seals.  The conversation seems to be that
one is better due to a higher tolerance for heat.  Final question:  Do I
remember correctly that there is some special high temp grease used on the
O rings to seal these things.  Any and all thoughts and suggestions
welcomed at jmeyer@cinbell.com.

     Thanks for the help.

Coupe because it would be unseemly for our two children to fight over the
Targa at my funeral.  She bought the argument.  What a woman.)
