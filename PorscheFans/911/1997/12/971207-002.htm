Jap,

Sounds like quite an adventure; welcome to the US Porsche scene.  I'm not
sure that you should spend a lot of money on an alarm especially when there
are several simple steps that you can take.  

You mentioned "car jacking".  For example, theft of the car while you are
in it and stopped at a light.  Your best defense is locking the doors, stay
alert, and leaving room in front to maneuver if something happens.  I
usually leave one car length so that I can go around the car in front of me.

Now, I also assume that you are asking about theft protection.  First,
always lock the car and take you keys.  Park in a well lighted area that is
reasonably busy.  Turn your wheels to the side so that the car can't be
pushed easily.

The real trick is to disable the engine so that it can't be started.  I use
The Club on the steering wheel as a visible deterent.  To disable the
engine, I remove the ignition wire running from the coil to the distributor
(easiest to pull from the coil end).  You can also remove the fuse for the
fuel pump.  It is located in the trunk and should be marked in the fuse
line up.

Most recently, I bought a simple remote ignition kill from Radio Shack.  It
includes an LED to further deter thieves.  I can provide helpful hints that
will speed installation to about 2 hours (it took me 4 hours without the
helpful hints).  Once activated, it prevents the starter from operating.

I believe in taking inexpensive, simple measures to deter the casual thief.
 You're unlikely to stop a committed professional thief; buy insurance to
cover this.
