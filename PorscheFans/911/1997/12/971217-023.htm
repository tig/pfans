Dan,
  That seems like a crazy reason to sell a 911. A knowledgeable shop
ought to be able to fix it - and not by replacing parts until something
works either. _If you he can't find a good shop by referral_, look for
someplace
that at least advertises "Bosch Authorized Service" . Ask the shop if they 
have the Bosch "hammer" (Bosch 9288 tool). Unless his '89 Carrera  is
a Carrara 4, you don't even need the "hammer" for his car but the fact that 
the shop has made the several thousand dollar investment in one is a good 
indication of how serious they are about fuel injection. 
  If you like your friend, talk him into getting it fixed.  If he's actually
not a 
very good friend [he just stole your girlfriend? he told the FBI you were the

Unibomber for the reward?, told the super-model that asked for your phone
number that you weren't interested and she went out with him instead? etc] 
well now's your big chance to take get him back. <g>

P.S. PFans, please don't get your shorts in a knot about the Bosch thing. 
Plenty of  shops can fix this sort of thing but if he has nothing to go 
on but an ad in the phonebook and a telephone number, I think
the Bosch+"hammer" criteria will increase his odds of finding a 
knowledgeable place .

David:  

Look in Excellence Magazine.  A number of dealers advertise there.  I've been
using Beaudry Porsche Audi in Tucson.  Unfortunately, David, their old parts
manager was shipped to another of their dealerships and replaced.   I don't
remember the replacement's name.  They used to have excellent prices and pay
the freight too.  I'd give them a try at 1-800-362-6364.  I think they offer
about 20% off and used to even be able to get some racing parts (at less
discount).
