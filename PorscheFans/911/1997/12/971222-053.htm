You're right.  I spoke with a Dunlop tech. who said that the SP8000 is the
replacement for the D40M2.  Looking at prices in Tire Rack, however,
indicates that theses tires are $50 - $60 more expensive per tire.  It
seems as though the outstanding value the D40M2 offered is lost, even if
the SP8000 is a slightly better performer on track (per the Dunlop tech).
