 I certainly would have to agree with Terry.  You need to have your shop
determine if you have a fuel problem or ignition problem.  They can put
a timing lite on and check for spark easily enough.  If there is no
spark indicated by timing lite, is it just a weak spark and not strong
enough to fire timing lite?  There should be a fat blue spark while
cranking engine.  Air box can be checked with a strong light and a
mirror.  CD unit should whine as Terry mentioned.
  Best to find out which is missing (fuel or spark) before replacing
parts which can get expensive also.  Good luck and be sure to let us
know what you find.
