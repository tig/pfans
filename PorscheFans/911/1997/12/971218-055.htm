 Hello ,
 I have a question on engine swaps. I am planning on switching a 2.4 from a
72T out for a 3.2 from an 87.
My question is , are there any webpages with the info? Or maybe it isnt
really
very difficult..
The two biggest questions I would have now are: Will the flywheel/clutch
assy.
need much changing or will the whole assy from the 72 work? 
 I know the 72 915 is a 225mm flywheel and the 87 3.2 has a 240mm. 

The other question would be about the oil lines, because of the oil tank
location. Will the 72 lines fit, are there lines that fit ,or do i need to
have lines made to fit?
I understand the converstion consists of much much more than just the
couple
items ive mentioned.
I really have many more questions , but ill post more later.

Any information would be of great help.
Thank you
 Eric

I just got done doing this swap it a 1970 911, and  on  Dec 27 it ran for
the first time in my car.
First you can not use a 1987 flywheel or clutch because it is far a G50 and
will not fit, you must use a 1984 -1986 flywheel.
Then you need a oil cooler if you car does not have one. I do not know what
you will need to do to the oil system on a 72 911. I had to make the "S"
hose longer and get some fitting made.
You can keep all of you gauges but the oil press sensor will need to be
change or the gauge will not read right.
You also need a return line for the fuel. I also had to make a small dent
on the back of the cross member to fit the fuel pressure regulator.
There are also a lot of thing that some be done when the engine is out.

This is a list of thing that I needed and the cost of parts

From the "school of hard knocks": a couple of years ago my '84 Carrera 
suffered from a dead alternator (failed in manner where dash light didn't come
on, so didn't have a warning).  Driving back from Mid-Ohio at dusk, turned on
 the lights and then started noticing that while sky was getting darker, so
were
 the lights!  Just when I figured the alternator was bad, the car died from
low
voltage; apparently there is a cutoff in the fuel injec. for low voltage.  Let
car 
sit for approx. 1/2 hour, turned key, it cranked and started, made it about 
another 10 miles when the FI quit again.  Finally had to get it towed.

Bottom line: if battery is very low, on at least on a Motronic system, car
will not
run.

     A few days ago there was some discussion on starting our cars with
very low batteries.
     It was suggested by some, that if the battery had enough "juice" to
crank the engine it was OK to start and go.
     I really disagree with this idea, it demostrates the good old "theory
vs reality" syndrome.

Dave, I have had very good luck with a dealer called Hoehn 
(1-800-984-6346; out in La-La Land).  I get right thru, their stock
is very good, they're pretty helpful and knowledgeable, shipping
is good (3-5 days ground UPS from LA to Pgh., PA) - pricces
are very good, too.

For my other cars, I've managed to find sources for factory parts
that offer a substantial discount over typical dealer prices.

 Does anyone know of a similar
source for Porsche 911 parts? There seem to be plenty of excellent
sources for aftermarket parts but what do you do when you need the
genuine article?
