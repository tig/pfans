I have a C4S (I talked myself out of the turbo, to my regret!) 
with M030 sport chassis. This is very similar to the TT 
suspension. I got a set of Porsche Euro springs from Windward 
Performance. They lowered the car 1 inch and improved looks and 
handling on the track.

Your TT is one of the fastest cars on the planet. In a friend's box 
stock 993T I lapped the local race track with times which were in the 
range normally reserved for  under 2 litre sedan race cars, or to put 
it another way, about 4 seconds faster than my C4S. 

I suggest that the best way to make the car go faster is to really 
learn how to drive it. A totally stock TT should blow off modified 
911's at any DEW if the driver knows how to use it.  A full 
blown 911 or 951 race car will be faster of course, but if you want a 
pure track car, go get one.  Me, I like being able to run the 
A/C while sitting in staging in the heat <grin>. Before messing 
up what is already a pretty hot suspension set up, I'd invest in race 
compound tires and lower it with Factory springs. My experience 
(personal) with Eibach and H and R springs on my 993's (yes 2) has not 
been very happy.  The Windward guys have done a fair amount of 
experimentation with their own 993 race car and seem to know what 
works and what doesn't.

Enjoy your TT I'm envious.

Bob
