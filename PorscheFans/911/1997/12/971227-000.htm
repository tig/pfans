Hello Jon

I don't have any experience with that particular motor but I know the
3.0 litre motors are virtually "bullet proof" and therefore the
predecessors should be limbering up to that.  You can redline the 3.0
motors for about 20 minutes before they need some attentiveness.  (I
haven't found a road long enough to do that on yet.)  The Porsche motors
are amongst the best ever produced from a factory with high volume
output.  Just look at today's racetrack results from factory-engine
Porsche racing 911s.  They're pretty much in the same class as Boeing
and Rolls Royce, etc, or better! (I'd be interested to find out.)

If you're low on oil the temp will go up and the engine will sound more
clackety, just like your lawn mower or boat or aeroplane will.  If
you're running at HIGH SPEED in a 911, say between 120 miles per hour
and upwards the temp will go up but that's OK if it stays within the
bounds or you can then install an oil cooler which runs the oil from the
engine thru to a heat sink kind of thing then back into the motor and
most of the heat "drops off" whilst in transit thru the maze of oil
pipes you've added in - the air/atmosphere cools the oil for you.  If
you're running at low speed and the temp goes up you're either low on
oil or you are moving so slow that the air cooling isn't working or
there might be another problem.  (I got caught in a Procession in
Adelaide, South Australia for 40 minutes and had to switch off, go for a
coffee, shop, then go back.)  You'd need to be running for about 3
minutes in a medium climate to notice the oil temp change due to low oil
or say 2 minutes in the tropics or say 4 minutes closer to the cool
zones (north or south poles).  Guesswork on my part.

If you switched your motor on for a few seconds and didn't hear anything
unusual then it should be OK - but you can check what the case is before
you go any further.

You said that some oil spilled out and then some more spilled out while
you were waiting.  You could then calculate that the "spill rate during
standing still" was so much per hour.  Since you know the times involved
you can calculate how much SHOULD HAVE leaked out during the oil
evacuation time and can therefore plot how much was in the engine at any
particular point in time, within reason.  So, you can then determine
whether the engine had enough oil to do whatever you asked of it.

3-4 seconds isn't really enough time to wait but if there wasn't enough
oil then that's the MAX you should have done most probably.

No point blowing a beautiful engine up.

Just thought you might like some different logic to apply to your
situation.  (Should put you in the driver's seat.)

Paul
