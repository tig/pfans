     Seasons Greetings from the Big Apple,
     
     A friend owns a '89 911 Carrera Coupe, which I told him I wanted to 
     buy when he sells. He wants to sell now (not to me) because the car 
     sometimes will not respond or sputters heavily to the throttle in 1st/ 
     2nd gear. His Porsche shop replaced the oxygen sensor but the problem 
     persists and they can't figure it out.  He's neither a car nor 
     Internet guy, hence this post.  I asked him if the shop checked his 
     throttle body or fuel injectors and he didn't know.  Is this a problem 
     common to '89 models.  I checked the '89 TSBs and it doesn't show up.
     Any help would be much appreciated and I hope this newbie post does 
     not offend anyone on this quality list.  I know this car has been 
     babied and may be able to join your ranks at a good price from a 
     grateful seller.
