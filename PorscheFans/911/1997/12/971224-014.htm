If, however, you want a tire that will allow you to REALLY appreciate
how a
Porsche can feel, the Bridgestone S02 is the best tire I've ever
experienced.
Are they expensive? Absolutely! Are they worth the price? That
depends on your
budget and how you want to experience your Porshce.

Having had the pleasure of spending a weekend driving a twin turbo in
the
Phoenix - Prescott, Arizona area (the car came with the SO2's) I can tell
you
that as impressed as I was with the car, I was equally impressed with
how well
those tires got that 400 hp to the ground.

I've installed the SO2's to all years of Carrera's. The owners are
delighted.
I also heat cycle tires, which really decreases tread wear.
_______________________________
While the S02's are excellent "street tires," if you want maximum tire
performance, then you need to run "R" rated racing tires, like BFG R1's. 
As nice as the S02's are, R1's would walk all over them.  R1's are also
half the price, so even though they wear out faster, they're really not
much more expensive, if at all.  I run R1's year round, and could never
put any street tire on my car, including S02's, after running R1's, and
previously Yokohama 008 RS's, on my sports cars for the past 10 years.
The only problem is if you live back East - not practical to run R1's in the
winter, but then you would want Blizzaks or the like anyway, and not
S02's.

My $.02.
