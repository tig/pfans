Hi,

I just installed a Pertronix unit myself. I have exchanged e-mail with
Margaret, but will add a little something for the rest of the list.

There are two wires. The red + wire goes to the fuel pump wire in the
back drivers side of the engine compartment, and the black wire gets
connected to the wire that the points connected to inside the distr.
However, since the two wires from the Pertronix unit need to exit the
distr, the new connection for the black wire must take place outside of
the distr.

Also, is it possible that you connected the + wire to the coil? The guys
at GPR said that it would fry the unit immediately, which is why you
have to use the fuel pump lead.

Another question for you, did you get right unit? GPR made sure that I
got the part # of my distributor so they could send the right one out.
Apparently there are different units for different 911s.
