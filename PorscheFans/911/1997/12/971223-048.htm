See  <http://www.kindel.com/Porsche> http://www.kindel.com/Porsche for the
story of my valve guide woes. 

In short, Barrier (and PCA) went beyond the call of duty and paid 60% of a
complete valve job (all 6 intake valves replaced, all 12 valve guides
replaced, etc...) on my 10 year old Carrera that I bought there last spring.
The car only had 6800 miles on it when I bought it. I now have all new
gaskets and seals, a bunch of new hoses and lines, an upgrade on my G50
tranny, and feel good about the $1700 I had to spend. 

They put Quaker State in it too. The chief wrench, Tony, told me that it's a
good idea to run non-synthetic after a major overhaul for just the reasons
you describe (non-synthetics clean better) but that if it were his car he'd
put Mobile 1 in it at the next oil change. Note, I wasn't using synthetic
before.

Barrier is probably too expensive for regular repair. I will probably go to
Squire in the future (unless I think the problem is Barrier's fault and I
can get them to pay for it <g>). But I'll definitely buy a car, new or used,
from Barrier again.

	Subject:	Mobil 1 and Barrier

	A month or so ago there was a thread about Barrier Motors in
Bellevue and
	their service policy of not putting Mobil 1 in cars brought in for
routine
	service.

	I had my '97 911 C4S in today for a 7500 mile oil/lube/filter and
some
	warranty items (really the reason I went there), and when I picked
it up, I
	was shocked to discover that they'd put Quaker State in the car
without even
	giving me the option.  The service rep I was dealing with started
making
	noises about how it didn't really matter, they were the same, and
besides,
	the regular stuff was cheaper.  After ranting for a bit, he said
'well, Bud
	Hoelscher in sales knows why we're doing this, let me go get Bud."
I've
	known Bud for a number of years, and here's what he told me:

	First, I should have been offered the choice, but the service rep
screwed up
	and didn't ask.  Apparently customers were complaining about two
things--the
	high cost of Mobil 1, and the fact that for the first 12K miles,
they were
	burning 1 quart per 500 miles in Mobil1.  Bud has implemented a
	recommendation for his customers to run regular oil for 3-5K miles,
and then
	switch back to Mobil 1.  Why?  So the rings will seat more quickly
and the
	engine will stop burning (as much) oil.  Makes good sense to me,
given the
	known problem that the newer cars that only run Mobil 1 tend to burn
oil
	much longer than they should.

	The service tech screwed up by not offering me the choice and by not
	understanding why to switch to regular oil for the duration of one
oil
	change.

	So, contrary to the thread going around, Barrier will install Mobil
1,
	should be giving customers a choice, and might recommend regular oil
for one
	oil change to get the rings seated, and then switch back to Mobil 1.

	Although I didn't buy my car there (their allocation was gone), I've
had
	good experience with their warranty service.  Given the relative
	incompetence of their service front desk guys, I don't think they'll
be
	getting my regular service once I'm out of warranty.  They also
tried to
	sell me a lower engine cover ("Did you know that your lower cover
was gone?
	We can order one for $275...).  I passed, since the one in my garage
works
	just fine where it's parked.

	Marc
