When I release the brake pedal in my 86 Targa, about 80% of the time I hear a
very strange sound.  It's not a metal grinding or anything like that but more
of a whine.  The only thing I can think of that sounds similar is when you hit
a tuning fork, almost like something in vibrating.  It doesn't matter if the
car is moving or stopped, clutch in or out.  It happens only when I release
the brake pedal (even during lite breaking).  The sound is not coming from the
pedal but it sounds like it comes from the trunk, directly infront of the
driver (isn't the master cylinder up there?).  I had the brake fluid changed a
few months ago and it didn't affect the problem (same as before the fluid
change).  The brakes work great btw.  While I am hearing the sound, if I
lightly touch the pedal (ie not enough pressure to turn on the brake lights)
the sound stops.

Has anyone heard anything like this?  Thanks in advance,

Happy Holidays!

Greg,

> 1.  What's your opinion of the stock settings for daily street driving?

Stock Euro height/camber is probably best but I don't know if there
is any difference in a '68 912 in the USA.

Yes. If you remove torsion bars, you can install them such that
the car is perfectly level but 2 opposite corners of the car
are carrying most of the load. Ask me how I know! I'll tell you
anyway, my car pulled SO BADLY at 5MPH that it was as if
a ghost was turning the steering wheel...

If you only replace one torsion bar at a time and put it back
the same way (same angle or same ride height) you may be ok. 
If you don't disturb any torsion bars then alignment will not throw
off corner balance much if at all.

> 3. When balancing weight, what do you use to measure the pressure under
> each wheel?

That's a problem, I used some Ruggles scales which are
bathroom scales with calibrated lever arms to reduce the
load on the scales. If you are clever you might be able
to rig up something similar and get close enough.
The ruggles were only accurate to 5 pounds or so I think.

Another version I have used is a long lever that lifts
up the wheel under the top of the rim and this pressure
moves a hydraulic guage at the pivot point. Not accurate
for weighing a car but percentages are all that matter
for corner balancing so they work well. You pull on
a piece of thin stiff cardboard while lifting the wheel with
your other hand (boy you're strong) and check the
reading when the wheel is just off the ground.

> 4. What's your advise/approach on re-building the steering/ front

There are 2 parts of the tie rods that wear out, inner and outer.
I've never had a bad ball joint on a Porsche but usually you
can feel slop if you jack up the wheel and pull on the
top or bottom of the wheel if the ball joint is bad. Some cars
you can feel it with the car on the ground. On my Porsches
I have felt significant play in the wheel bearings that could confuse you
though.  I would replace those too and re-grease while I was at it.

Good luck!
