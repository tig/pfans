  Lance,
I have one of these on my C4 and on the 964 3.6L engine, which doesn't
breath that well in stock trim, it makes a big difference in throttle
response and power throughout the range, especially above 5500rpm where
the stock engine starts to flatten.  I have found it works well when
match with a free flow exhaust.  Measured 30+hp gains, yes.
That said, the 3.2 is a totally different engine with different tuning
needs.  From what I've read about 3.2's you will gain more by removing
some exhaust restriction first.  This is certainly cheaper.  Also take a

close look at the curves for the 3.2L they publish. The MFS torque
curves show less drop off above 5500 which extends the HP peak.  This is

great if you do a lot of your driving between 5000 and 6500.  IMHO an
MFS is an expensive first upgrade for the HP improvement it gives.

The system was easy to install, with simple hand tools in 1-2 hours, but

figure on taking the car to a shop with a Bosch Hammer to adapt the
motronic to the new sensor output.  They say it isn't required, but my
car wouldn't idle until I spent $120 at the dealer.
