$11,500!  $11,500!!?!?!!  The guy said this with a straight face right?  Allen
Funt didn't jump out from behind the counter did he?

As a data point, I had my car totally repainted  within the last year.  In
the course of the repaint, rear end accident damage was repaired (which
is what precipitated the re-paint), SC flares were added, windshield
gasket replaced and I bought and installed fiberglass bumpers, etc.
The shop used Sikkens paint and even re-painted just about all of
the black trim (door handles, window frames, etc.).  Total cost - about
$7000.

I wouldn't be able to stomach $11,500 for a paint job.  $5,500 sounds
reasonble given the amount of work to do.

Good luck,
