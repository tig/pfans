Re the two inquiries about dent removal in Philadelphia:  In my
experience, if you don't know a source for paintless dent removal in
your area, a new car dealer will--that's where the demand first came
from.   

Typically the dent remover (with a name like Dent Doctor or something
similar) is a mobile operation that goes from dealer to dealer, although
I know one body shop that's been "thinking about" getting into it.  I
found my source while he was doing work for the Jeep dealer and I had my
car in for service.  There had been a crease from a shopping cart in the
right rear door of my Cherokee that I had lived with for three years,
and for $75 he made it truly disappear.

Charges are typically by the panel, in the neighborhood of $75-80 each.
So long as the paint isn't broken, your chances of satisfaction are very
good.

They don't pull dents, but massage them from the other side with a
combination of variously shaped trowels.  In some cases they have to
drill holes for access, but they plug them up.  If it's a door, there's
a good chance they can get to it by pulling the interior panel.
