Hi Scott,

This may be too trivial, but the first thing I would check is the tightness
of the belts.  My alternator belt was a bit too loose on my 84 carrera, and
started emanating that high pitch squeal you described.  I tightened it up,
and all I hear now is the beautiful music of the flat 6.  Good luck.

Bob

Subject:  911 C4 High pitch whistle problem




I have a 1990 911 C4 with about 69k miles.  A few months back the car
started making a high pitch squel (like a human whistle) coming from the
engine compartment.  The pitch varies with engine RPM.  Doesn't matter if
car is moving, clutch engaged, etc.  Seems to do it more frequently when
air temps are cold (<40 F).
I appears from the direction it is coming from that it could be the
colloing fan's bearing or maybe some part of the dual distributors.  But
really - I have no clue.
Any suggestions on what would commonly cause this type of noise?  BTW, I
have had the distributor belt break, replaced and the vent kit added.
Thanks,
