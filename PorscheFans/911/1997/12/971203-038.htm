Pfans,

I love this heel and toe/double clutch/rev matching thread.
I learned to do it with my 66 MGB with no 1st gear synchros
and there is no going back :)

For street driving I do it  for the pure enjoyment of knowing how to do
it and (attempting to) do it well.

Mostly I do it for rev matching (you don't need to double clutch
for that, but perhaps you need to heel and toe).

A perfectly rev-matched downshift feels so satisfying :)  And it feels
great to double clutch into 1st on the run in a sports car
with weak or no synchros in first.

I was inspired years ago while reading one of the national car
rags:  One of the editors went for a drive with Paul Frere:  He
remarked at how smoothly Paul did everything right down to operating
the switches.  I have never witnessed anyone drive like this but
have endeavored to do it myself ever since, and the notion of
rev matching fits that nicely.

Hey, driving obsession takes many forms :)
