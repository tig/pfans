Mr. Romero/Porsche & Ferrari list members,

As an owner of both of these fine breeds of sportscars, I would like to say
that 99% of fellow owners do not share the antagonistic viewpoint of Mr.
Romero.  In my dealings with both groups I have found considerable enthusiasm
for sports cars in general.  But then again, most of my social time comes at
track events and race shops.  Mr. Romero, if you feel the Porsche owners are
all show and no go, perhaps you should show them at the next PCA track event in
your area.

There's some terrific people in both camps.  I have friends and acquaintences
in the Viper Club, RX-7 Club, Corvette Club, BMWCCA, etc, too.  They're all
sportscar/driving lovers.  Sure, everyone has their preferred marque.  Many,
like me, want to have one of each.  :)

As far as "look-at-me, I'm cool but clueless" owners, every marque has their
fair share.  The rest of us will just have to endure, understand, and accept.

I'm curious Clyde, why did you buy your car?

Regards,

Ted Arneson
