We had the opportunity to visit Germany a few years ago and decided to 
rent a NICE car while we were there. Our trip was to begin in Munich and 
then south to Austria to ski the glaciers in the Tirol Alps. We don't 
have a lot of money but this was to be a trip to really enjoy. Heidi had 
made the air and hotel accomodations and my deal was the car. My choice 
from Europcar was a 5 series BMW, but two days before departure they 
could not confirm our car reservation! Panic! As I went down the list of 
optional rides with the reservationist on the phone, she asked if I 
would mind a Porsche. Elevated heart rate! I asked what kind. She said 
it would be a 911 fwd. She thought that meant front wheel drive but I 
guessed (hoped) four wd. Anyway we knew it was a 911 so we agreed, and 
Heidi went to the Automaster in Vermont to see what we needed to do to 
pack for two weeks of skiing in a much smaller car.
Well, my greatest excitment was in the parking garage in Munich three 
days later as I scurried around to the back of the brand new Porsche 911 
to see that it did indeed say in that beautiful script "Carrera 4"!
Man o' man! What a feeling. We jam packed our baggage in, cooerced the 
technician into fitting a ski rack, and on June twenty first headed out 
of the city with two pars of Volkle race skis on the top of the dream 
car and aimed for the unbelievable experience of driving and skiing and 
driving (and driving) in the Alps of Austria, Italy and Switzerland.
