I believe that the 993 Turbo S has a strut brace, so you should
be able to get one.  The Carrera RS had one, but I think that car
was only available in Europe.

I recently had S-CAR-GO install one on my Carrera.  It turned out
quite nice.  It was originally from the Racer's Group, but then
S-CAR-GO had it polished to give a nice appearance.

Bob--The last I heard, from the tech guru of our local PCA region, was that as
of Jan. '97, no alcohol was required to be added to gasoline in this (Seattle)
area. Which is not to say that some brands still have it--as I believe Arco
and BP might. The advice from this person and others in the club is to use
Chevron as 1st choice, or Texaco. My local Chevron stations no longer have the
gasahol stickers on the pumps, and I believe that none is added.
Please let me know if you find otherwise.
