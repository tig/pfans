Just wanted to add.  That rental, with the sustitution and free upgrade 
as well as a favorable exchange rate (reservations having been made well 
in advance) cost us about $110 a day total, including gas and insurance.
We would gladly have paid much more for such an adventure!  If you love 
to drive and you love Porsches (duh!) I would highly recommend the 
Tirolean Alps.

Guys:

Out of curiosity, were the manuals in the dark red binders with 4 hole
punching and printed (copied) on glossy paper?  If so, they were probably
factory.  If not, probably knock-offs.  The photos in the factory ones
sometimes look like they've been copied a few too many times.  You might try
microfiche because the price is MUCH cheaper, usually $15-30 a set if I
remember correctly although the quality is not great for some of the older
cars.  You'd save enough to buy the reader and some parts fiche also!   Buy
the stuff through a dealer that advertises in Pano or Excellence and ask for a
their published discount (20 or 25 percent for some).
