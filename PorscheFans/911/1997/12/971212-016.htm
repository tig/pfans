Thank you Scott Winders. I am getting sick of reading on this list that
911s don't have MacPherson strut suspensions. Just because they have
torsion bar springs does not mean they do not have MacPherson struts.
The MacPherson strut traditionally uses a coil spring but that doesn't
mean it has to. A MacPherson strut suspension uses the strut in place of
an upper suspension arm. Its like having an upper link with an infinite
length (or a slider mechanism). The strut and lower arm determine the
path taken by the wheel when it is deflected. This is in contrast to
having an upper and lower arm defining this mechanism. The spring type
does not change this. I realize I'm probably going to be corrected about
some things since I'm going off of vague memory, but I'm going to pull
my hair out if I hear on this list one more time that 911s don't have
MacPherson struts.

Huh??

Porsche did not invent the torsion bar.

All 911's have a McPherson strut front suspension. Some, depending on
year
model, use torsions bars and some use coil springs. In other words, a
torsion bar is a spring and cannot be compared to a suspension type such
as a McPherson strut.

This kind of like saying my dog is better than your shotgun. Both are
used
to hunt, but they perform different tasks.
