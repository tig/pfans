Take a look at the tech section of the WEB site for the Sacramento Valley
Region PCA
at http://www.DerPorsche.net/.  My notes from when I swapped out the '82
3.0 in my
SC for an '89 3.2 are there.  Plan to take lots of time and do it right.
You will need to get very
intimate with the wiring and fuel systems.

assy.

Unless converting to carbs, you will need the flywheel from the 3.2 for the
 DME sensors
for engine speed and position.

I believe the oil lines will work but don't forget the cooler up front.
