I suspect you paid too much.  The pads should rarely exceed what you can
buy them for over the counter (the mechanics allways get a discount,
only the 20% PCA discount at some dealerships can match the wrench's
price).  The labor time of 1 hour to replace pads for either front or
rear is about standard across the country (my reference points LA, CA;
Hou, TX; Dallas, TX; Minn, Minn; Greenwich, CT; Princ, NJ; Miami, Fl). 
The time for flushing the brakes is too high and should have reflected
the wheels already off the car (1.0 hour max).  The light override and
ABS/flushing issues could worst case add another 0.5 hours.  Total brake
labor s/b 3.5 hours max.  Rear cover removal, 0.5 max again (If your
wrench can't beat that time with a car on a lift, worry).

As a high-line p-car owner, you might have been subject to the "he can
afford it, he'll never check the prices, we've got bills to pay"
syndrom.  As an ex-dealership mechanic and an ex-shop owner, I can tell
you that I've seen it quite a bit.  Some mechanics forget that basic
repairs and maintenance are just that, basic, and it doesn't matter
whether on a Ferrari, Lexus, or Toyota.  The number of hours charged is
generally static with a few well known exceptions (for instance Saab 900
front pads w/ handbrake adjustment required, 914 rear pads w/ stuck
adjusters).  The Hourly Labor Charge is where there is variability for
the economics of the region of the country and the degree of
care/special tools/training which the particular auto make commands.

Contrasting all this, you're way too late to gripe to the owner and
expect anything.  If it takes three months to realize you paid too much,
maybe your time/money is better spent elsewhere.  Best case would be
credit on future work, but I'd be surprised/sceptical because those
types of arrangements are prone to hour escalation with the wrench
netting same as before for the work performed.  The shop usually figures
if you gripe and they cut you a check, they'll never see you again
anyway.  Before I got too hot and heavy with them I'd recheck the parts
prices with a new vendor and check the hours which a dealership would
charge (that number should never be exceeded by an independent shop). 
If the time charged is less than at a dealer, then he's cconceptually
filled his role in the auto service scheme of things on the labor issue.
