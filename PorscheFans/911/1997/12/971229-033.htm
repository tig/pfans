Hi Michael,

Here's what I know.  I've tried twice now unsuccessfully to rent Porsches
while travelling in Germany.  However, perhaps you will have better luck
than I.  The best price I received for a 911 was 300 DM with unlimited
miles from AVIS.  I was told that the unlimited mileage and the price was
discounted because I am a very frequent renter (sign up for their wizard
card).  Now, here's the catch.  What you are actually getting is a
reservation for that class of car which also happens to include a couple of
select BMW's and Mercedes.  Both times, all of the Porsches were rented.

Hertz rents Boxters for 249 DM per day, and I don't know if there is an
additional charge for mileage.  Once again, you are only getting a
reservation for that class of car.  I've turned down the Z3 a couple of
times now.

FYI, the current exchange is 1.77 DM = $1.

Good luck,

Bob

Ok folks here it is, the question asked as often as any other. For
christmas I recieved the gift of a trip to Europe. Now, having never been
out of the country, I am anctious to head for Germany, the Autobahn, and of
course a few laps of the famed Nurburgring.
I very much want to rent either a Boxster, or 911 while there for a day or
two. I called both Hertz, and Avis but neither company was much help other
than saying that they thought there were Boxsters available, BUT they did
not have availability, or price information. Anybody actually in Germany
who might be able to help me out here? Anybody have any experience with
Porsche rentals? I thought I remembered someone saying Avis had 911's for
somewhere around $150-$175 a day, but that was about a year ago.
ANY, and all help would be VERY much appreciated.
Thank you
