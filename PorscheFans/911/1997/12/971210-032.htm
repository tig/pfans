Pfans,

At last... 

Allan Caldwell wrote a real nice article (wire diagrams and pictures;
December issue of PANO p.70), on how the DME relay controls electric power
to the fuel pump. 

It seems that the first of the two relays is activated by turning on the
ignition switch and/or disabling the alarm (is one is installed). 

My question: does the factory alarm (key in the door type) that was an
option in 84-89 cars (I think) interrupts the power to this relay?   


Hint... a spare in the glove compartment might be a good preventive measure.

No, the engine doesn't have to come out, but you need a heck of a long
Allen wrench to fit the upper starter bolt.  I went up to Sears and bought
the longest 10mm Allen wrench they had, and used this with a ratchet
wrench with a 10mm socket to get at the upper mount.  Cutting the wrench 
was larely a trial & error procedure.  Things are tight up there!

I had similar symptoms as yours - cold starts OK, hot starts non-existent.

The starter (or solenoid) on my 911SC is flaky - it only works when the =
engine is cold, and then not very often.

When it works, I hear the fan motor in the front, but absolutely no =
noise from the engine area.

I haven't jacked it yet, but plan on doing that tomorrow.  The Haynes =
manual seems to imply (it's pretty good at implying, but that's all) =
that the engine/transmission must be dropped to change the starter. =20

If that turns out to be necessary, it's beyond my scope.

Is in necessary to do this to change the solenoid, also?

Thanks for your help.  It's not always possible to park on a hill!

This is a repost due to the 911 list problems.

I am in the research phase for installing race-style shoulder harnesses 
in my 993, and have decided to use a factory belt-end installed on the 
inboard lap belt end to secure the belt to the factory buckle mounted 
to the seat.  Was wondering if anybody had any old factory belts they no 
longer needed; all I need is the metal fitting that connects to the seat
buckle. 

Would also be interested in what folks have done regarding outboard lap
belt end and submarine belt installation on 993/C2/C4 vehicles.  I am looking
at
going with the Brey-Krause harness bar, and don't want to go the rollbar/cage
 route.
