I only got one reply when I posted this last week, so I'll try again.
I'm not sure what's wrong with my '79 SC, but  the best guess I've heard
from someone is that my timing chain has jumped/tensionor collapsed. I'd
like some more opinions before tearing into the engine.
      Background:  I blew up the original engine (another story), and
was
in a hurry to get it back on the road since it was my only car and I
bought a used '79 SC engine from my local used Porsche dealer.  No, it
doesn't have the Carrera chain tensioners.  The engine had apparently
been apart and whatever needed replacing was replaced (I know for sure
that newer, but not new pistons were put in, along with new chain
tensionors; not sure what else).  I know that wasn't good research on my
part, but I was in a rush.  It ran
fine for about two months when I was rear-ended by a motorcycle doing
120+ (of course, this is still 50 percent my fault here in Germany, but
that's also another story).  It sat for a couple of weeks, then I got
word I was deploying to Bosnia for 6 months and I was leaving in less
then a week, so I drove it over to my local used Porsche dealer and let
them fix it while I was gone.  They drove it a couple of times just to
move it around the yard, but never took it on the road; so it sat for
most of the 6 months not moving much.  After I came back, I started to
drive home, got about 1/2 a mile, and it started making an unbelievable
racket.  I pulled over and ended up towing it back to the used Porsche
dealer.  What it does now is that it will start, run for smoothly for
about a minute or two (even if I accelerate is some), and then start to
run real rough for about 10 seconds and die.  If I try and give it gas
as it starts to run rough (right before it dies), it backfires.  I've
checked the fuel pressures (control and system), and they're both good.
I've played with the timing, and it seems to run best around 15 AFTER
TDC.  I towed it over to Bosch (they have service centers everywhere
over here), they took one look at my MSD
ignition and told me the problem was that I didn't have the Bosch CD
ignition (they also hooked it up to their engine analyzer, but couldn't
find anything, so they blamed it on the MSD).
    So, what does this sound like?  Collapsed tensioner?  Is it possible
for a tensionor to collapse (cause of original noise), the cam timing to
get off slightly, and repressurize (causing the absense of noise now)?
I talked to my local used Porsche dealer about it, and he thinks my
problem is in the fuel injection system.  He says if the cam timing was
off enough to not run, it'd destroy the engine.
    Any help appreciated.
