I had exactly the same problem Walter describes with Webers once. 
Indeed, the float stuck down after the carbs were drained.  In my case,
there was just enough radial movement in the float that the swing arm
jammed.

At the time I was told that floats can wear, so I changed it and never
had another problem.
