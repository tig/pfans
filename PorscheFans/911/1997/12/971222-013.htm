Last week I got myself an early Christmas present: the 7" H4's that
replace the standard sealed beam.  Replacement took about 10 minutes and
the difference was like night and day, literally.  The low beam
adjustment instructions were clear, but for the product's intended use:
a motorcycle.  

Questions:

1. The Hella spec calls for the upper horizontal cut-off of the beam to
be 100 mm (4") below the height (center of lamp to ground) of the
headlight.  This is pretty low for a Porsche.  Anyone using something
different? 

2. From the center of the each headlight projection, the upper cut-off
slopes up to the right at a 30 degree angle.  For the motorcycle, there
is no confusion that this is centered.  With the car, 10 m from a wall,
I could adjust it so I would see each headlight projection side-by-side
(as would be the case if two motorcycles were projecting against the
wall.  Or, I could "toe in" the headlights so I would see the two
headlight images superimposed on one another, creating one brighter
image centered between the car's headlights. Does anyone have any
suggestions?

Details, details.  I guess I couldn't be happy with spending only $85 to
improve the lighting by 90%.  Now, I'll spend 2 weeks obsessing about
the adjustment trying to get the last 10%.  Does anyone else get accused
of being a compulsive-obsessive?...... I thought so.  Happy Holidays!
