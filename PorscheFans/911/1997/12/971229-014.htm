Todd:

I have a '74 and use 15x7 cookie cutters (911 or early 944) front and
rear.  205/60R15 BFG R1 will bolt on with no mods.  225/50R15 will
require rolling the fender lips.  225/50 is tight and you should do a
trial fit first. 
With 225/50s, you may need to run at least 1.5 deg negative camber since
the
extra inch of 7" wheels is to the outside.  Running same tire size
front/rear and rotating between each event significantly improves tire
life. 

Hope this helps,

Regards,

   ----------
   I own a 76 911s targa and have a terrific set of stock Fuchs.  My
   question is
   this: What is the maximum width wheel I can run at front and rear of
   the car?
   I would also need to know what wheels I can look for from other
   porsche cars.
   I do not want to add flairs to my car.  I am also in the market for
   some sport
   seats or a racing bucket if any one out there has one at a little
   better than
   fair market price. I do not want to buy a seat in need of new
   upholstery.
   Thanks in advance.
