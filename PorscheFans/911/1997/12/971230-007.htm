Ken
The folders are dark red, are four-punched, and the paper is rather slick,
but I would not call it glossy.
Microfiche is probably a good alternative for some, but I think we would
all like to see this information digitalized and put on CD.

Hi folks, 
  No matter which tire brand you choose to run at the track, if it is a street
tire, it needs to be shaved to get maximum performance and treadwear,FOR TRACK
USE ONLY !!! When Bridgestone introed the tire 2 years ago at Road Atlanta,
Hurley Haywood, David Murry, and a couple of others, put many many laps on a
set of shaved S02's and we never had any problems out of the tires or the 1995
Super Cup car( Which has always been run without the rear pan).
   I suspect later on this year when BFG R-1's and Hoosier  18" racing rubber
get into the pipeline we won't have to worry about running street tires on the
track !
