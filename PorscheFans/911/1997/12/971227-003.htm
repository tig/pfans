I don't think there is a heckuva lot you can "check" or "look for".  I doubt
you did any serious damage to the engine.  Heck, there was a guy that
posted something here (or was it pfiles?) about changing the oil in his
daily driver (non pcar) and forgetting to put oil back in the engine.  He
drove it back and forth to work for something like a week before he
noticed anything awry.

If the leak was at the return line to the tank, and not the supply line
to the oil pump, I'd lose even less sleep.  Fix the line, fill her back
up with oil and enjoy...
