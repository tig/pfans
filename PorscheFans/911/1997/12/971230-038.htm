   I have a basement garage to work in but really all I have as far as =
tools are 4 jack stands and a small floor jack. Is it possible to get =
the car up enough to get the engine out using just this equipment?
   Probably not. Last time I did it in a garage I  jacked up the
rear..floorjack under engine ...disconnect everything....lower engine....lift
up rear of car with a  "comealong"  . I ran a chain around  a couple of 4x4s
that lay on celing rafters. the rafters were braced with 4x4 temporary posts
on both sides of the car. I ran a chain between the rear engine mounts. You
need to put a BACKING PLATE  under the rubber mounts to prevent them from
pulling out. The larger the floor jack the easier the job. Your oil leak could
be coming from the thermostat. It has a big fat o-ring around it. And it is
located on top in front .
