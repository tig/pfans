I have had the same Warning light problems as Stan and Melissa. I occasionally 
get the "ABS" and "AWD" warning lights. After some time "ALL" the warning 
lights will be lit and the warning buzzer sounds. I can force this to happen 
much quicker by turning on the head lights. I'm guessing this occur faster 
because of either greater current draw or increased noise level in the 
electrical system. The only way to reset the dash lights and buzzer is to 
restart the car. However, the condition usually returns in a few minutes. This 
usually happens only when the car is warmed up. I realize there may be 
something in the ABS system malfunctioning which causes the first two warning 
indicators to be lit. However, I more concerned about the secondary effect of 
all the warning lights and buzzer begin triggered. 

After checking Mellisa's list, I suspect a faulty noise suppressor may be the 
cause of some of my problems. After I had my valves adjusted I've noticed a 
lot more ignition noise coupled to the radio. I'm not sure but I don't 
remember having the second problem before getting the tune-up. I asked my 
mechanic if it was possible that a ground connection had been left 
unconnected. He didn't think so. Any suggestions on how to isolate a bad noise 
suppressor? Do I swap them out one by one until the noise level goes down or 
is it best to replace all of them? Can you purchase them individually or do 
you have to get a set of 12?

Thanks in advance for your help

     Hello,
          
     I would be very interested to hear if anyone else has had this 
     problem. My 90 C4 just started doing the same thing. All of the 
     warning lights will blink for a moment and then go off. It acted       
     like Melissa's once where I had to shut the car off and restart. The 
     car seems to run fine when this problem occurs. I have heard what I 
     believe to be a clicking noise from under the dash like a relay or 
     perhaps electrical arching. Is it possible that the ignition switch is 
     going bad. Any help would be appreciated.
          
     Thanks,

     Subject: 90 C2 Warning lights Question
          
     Hello,
          
     I've owned my 1990 C2 Cabriolet for a whole month now, so I hardly
     qualify as an experienced Porsche owner.
          
     As I was driving to work today, my beloved car suddenly started 
     beeping at me, and all the warning lights on the dashboard were on.  
     Oh my!
     Anyway, I pulled over, stopped the car, stopped shaking, and restarted
     the car, and everything seemed fine -- no warning lights or beeping.  
     I got to work without further incident.
     Does anyone know what could have caused this?  Is it a glitch in '90
     C2's, or is it something I should get checked out immediately?
          
     Thanks in advance for your help.
