Hi Mark;

To install the windshield mounting strips, yes liquid dish soap works -
you can use it straight, but use a mild brand like Ivory.  Also, on the
65 - 68 911 series (I had a 65 I restored, I think that it was a
Hirschmann chrome manual that was OEM for those years.  The 912 may have
been different, but I wouldn't think so.  Anyway, manual Hirschmann's
are available in either black or chrome for about $20.

Hope this helps,

John Dunkle
