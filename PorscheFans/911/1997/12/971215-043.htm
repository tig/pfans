Nick,

If you are fairly sure the engine was in running condition when removed,
you are smart to avoid a bottom end job.  Street-driven 2.4s with
regular oil changes can go into the 150,000-200,000 mile range before
they require bearings; which, by the way, are radically expensive for
standard-by-standard and obsenely expensive for "cut" sizes.

P/Cs are almost a direct drop-in swap, assuming correctly sized ports. 
You ALWAYS want to do a valve job whenever you can, so these will need
to come off anyway...and by parts-price standards, getting the heads
done is not too bad on the pocketbook.

If you plan top do the work yourself, you'll need a dial caliper plus
stand/jig (I think around $200 for the pair); and the cam tools, which
you will surely need to get the right torque (read: big numbers!).

On the plus size, the 2.4 is an excellent choice to build-up a sixer
motor.  Think about getting used 2.2S pistons used and re-ringing them.
S cams are best for a track engine, E cams are fine if you will be doing
primarily street driving.

Great buy!  Have fun and take your time.  Measure everything and try not
to be too daunted by the technical savvy of the engineering.
