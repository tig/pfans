I repost this message hoping someone who might have had similar problem
or fix might not have seen when it was last posted. I've had a battery
draw down problem which I have traced to the in dash
heater AC unit. The small fan located at the back of the unit sometimes
remains on. If the number 1 fuse is pulled, the fan a course stops. When
the fuse is reinserted, depending upon the air temperature, the fan will
restart or not restart.  (If it cold the fan stays on. If it is warm
weather the fan will stay off.  Also should the air temperature turn
cold the fan will turn itself  back on) I have had the unit out of the
dash and disconnected the blue and wires which power the small fan.
However I continue to get an electrical draw of  .35 amps as there seems
to be a relay staying closed.  Is there a temperature sensor somewhere
which is staying hot when of course  it should not be powered with the
ignition turned off.  I hope this is not a bad unit as I'm told the
unit, even used, is expensive. I also don't want to buy a unit and find
it's not the unit but instead something in line between the fuse and the
unit itself.
Any ideas?

We use essentially the same process tire rack does for heat cycling. Our shop
has a car with a set of heat cycles R1's. The tires have been on for six
months now and have been driven by one to three drivers at five events, which
were autocrosses except for one two day time trial. The car took top time of
day at our autocross last weekend. The tires were hooking up great. Lack of
better brakes was our biggest problem, which we'll improve on by our next
event in February.

By the way, the tires still have tread left to start next season. Until they
start loosing grip we'll keep driving them.

If you've read the BFG report on heat cycling you'll see that their tests
included tires heat cycled by several different methods. Their testing
concluded that ANY heat cycling process achieved the same result. The key was
a minimum 24 hour curing period after the FIRST heat cycle of the tire after
manufacture. They also determined that curing over 48 hours had no effect on
the process.

There sure is a lot of conflicting info running around about tires. We're
trying to keep accurrate info on our customers and our own tire wear and
stick, especially among different brands.
