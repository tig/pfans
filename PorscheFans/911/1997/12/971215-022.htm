Ray,

I have dealt with RD in the past (regarding a non-Porsche) and they had
the best prices and were very pleasant and helpful in answering
questions.  As a matter of fact, I am getting ready to purchase
Bilsteins for my 911 from RD. 

As for your other questions, I would feel more comfortable if someone
else from the list with more expertise would step up.

Season's Greetings To All!
   And... a couple o' questions.  I have standard Boge shocks
on the front of my 86 Carrera, and I want to change them to
regular Bilsteins (not the heavy duty racing ones).  Are these
a direct bolt in replacement?  I've heard mention of "inserts",
but I don't know what this is.  After changing front shocks, is
a re-alignment required?  Is front shock changing an easy job?
The car is now on jackstands with front calipers, hubs and rotors
off.  I have a clear shot at the struts/shocks.
   RD Enterprises advertises in Pano a set of four Bilstein shocks
for $379.  Is this a good deal and are they a good company?
Thanks to all, and have a Merry!
