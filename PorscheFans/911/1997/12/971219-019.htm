>How do we account for 915 (transmission), set between 914 and 916?

I think that the 911 went through several iterations in which major
changes were made to engine/transmission/body etc. So it started out
with 901 series parts. Then, at some stage, it used a 915-series
transmission. At a later stage there were 930-series engines. I don't
know if the 915-series included an engine. My guess is that Porsche did
the 914 project. After the start of that the next engineering project
was number 915 and that was a transmission + maybe other things. Then
there was, I think, a 916 project which was aimed at devising a follow-
on to the 914.

Can you help me out here?
