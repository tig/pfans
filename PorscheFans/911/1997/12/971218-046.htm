Alan;

Incredible!  It's apparently fortunate for me that they missed about
$5,000 of my business in the recent past.  Based on your experience, I'm
now glad they never returned my calls about:

1: - RSR coil-overs- bought 1 month ago from someone else;

2:- Adjustable Fuel Regulator - bought 1.5 months ago from someone else;

3:- SSI Exchangers and exhaust - bought 2 months ago from someone else;

4:- Turbo Performance Kit  +~$1,000 for other parts -  bought - well you
get the idea.....

Maybe they ought to understand *what* customer service is - or figure
out how to get messages off their answering machine or actually call
someone back...  Again, I've only left messages on their answering
machine during their "advertised business hours" - they musta been
packing your stuff you never ordered.

Would I call them again? Not NOW....  I sure hope others have better
luck with them....
