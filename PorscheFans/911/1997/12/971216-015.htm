	Thanks to Mike and all others for the answer to this and the
tires !  As for the wires, I had time to look around yesterday, but
still couldn't really find out what they do !  One of them is sort of
looped onto itself, the other appears to be cut. Both are inside a
protecting tubing of sorts. The plate lights work, so do all the lights
actually... I assumed it was a some sort of ground (and that's a
probably a stupid ass...umption)... On the other side of the car, where
there is much less room in the wheel well BTW, the same wire connects to
the inside of the wheel well on  a round metal plate (hard to be
precise, it's covered in mud and crud), but there is no such attachement
on the driver side rear wheel well.... I'm confused. I really need a
book ! 

	OTOH, I received my first Pano yesterday, but was a little
dissapointed because I had already read the Porsche CEO interview in
Automobile.... Oh well.... ;-) 

	Thanks again !  

	Greg.
