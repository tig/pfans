Hi Pfans:
I'm hoping that someone can recommend a book that will detail Dr. =
Ferdinand Porsche's activities
during the Second World War.  I'd be most interested in an account that =
explains the reasons for Dr.
Porsche's imprisonment and comparison's of other collaborators =
punishment.  The text does not have
to be based on Dr. Porsche but primarily on the imprisonment of =
industrialist collaborators, their
trials, charges, and dispositions.

Most of the accounts I've found gloss over the reason's for his =
imprisonment.  In fact some of the
web sites I've visited have conflicting facts.   What little I have =
learned I gained from the
Speedvision broadcast of the Beetle history.  =20

Thanks in advance.

P.S.  Did any one see that Austrian Race Friday night on Speedvision?  =
Wow! it was like demolition
derby with 911s.  I didn't know that you could cut through the grass on =
corners, these guys were
really aggressive.  Exciting racing!  Some racer's engine started smoking=
 then the left rear wheel
shot straight up in the air!
