I once had a '66 VW Bug with gasoline burning heater mounted in the
trunk. You had to keep the windows down to keep from being overcome
by the exhaust fumes (I'm guessing it didn't do this when new :-)
but it made so much heat you would have had to put them down anyway
to keep from melting! There's no reason one of these couldn't work
in a 911. I'm told these were actually pretty common in early Bugs -
you might be able to track down a good one at a VW swap meet.
