Yes, I would agree that the S02 are fabulous "street tires", but not so
great on the track. I have the last vestiges of them on my 97 C4S because
of a lot of DE track time in 97. On the track they hold well, squeel a lot
at their limit, are progressive towards their friction limit, are fabulous
in rain, and distort a lot. When I get off the track, the narrow interior
tread blocks show a 15-30 degree angle of wear on the front tires, so they
don't hold up under extreme cornering. I've seen others S02's with this
same wear pattern. So I would say that I am not happy with them for track
work, but I like them for track rain or street purposes. I would like to
get another tire that does not wear so strangely in the dry, and holds
better on the track.

I've looked at Pirelli P-Zeros on other C4S cars and found them to not have
this kind of strange wear. The Pirelli's last longer, and are not as loud.
They seem to hold just as well when I compare how fast these other C4S's
are on the track, side by side (my car against the other). Tire Rack
recommended the Michelin MXX3 Pilot Sx for replacement because they have a
stiffer tread block, hold better, and are more responsive. But they claim
that the Michelin's are not as good in the rain, and have a stiffer ride.
So for my track work the Michelin's and Pirelli's seem like a better choice.

Anyone else have 1st hand knowledge about these 18" tires on a C4S or TT ?
