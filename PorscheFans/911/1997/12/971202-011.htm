Hello Fans,

Er...I know that many of you will ask what I'm up to doing this, but 
I've always been a sort of 'do or die' kinda person-  and decided it was 
OK to drive my 912E in torrential rain for 6 hours on the return leg of 
my latest 900 mile Italian road rage tour.

Oil pressure:  OK.
Engine Temp:  Warm, but OK.
Speeds:  Sustained between 80-100 mph, average over 900 miles about 65 
mph.
Traction/handling:  Excellent.
Watertight Integrity:  NONE!!

Yep, I've got a major leak.  (Somwhere!)  The sunroof doesn't leak, the 
doors are sealed, the front bonnet/trunk area was dry, but the cabin had 
a serious wetness about it (standing water).

Road conditions:  Terrible, storms heavy rain, deep puddles for about 6 
hours of driving (in the dark!) at relatively high speed.  OK, not good.  
But where are the holes?  Suggestions on a p-card appreciated.

R/Dave Lovato

'76 912E  #9126000496  (Now drying out with the carpets out...)

P.S. I'm gonna help out with the PFE trip to Mille Miglia '98 so e-mail 
me if you are thinking of hooking up with the Euro-Porschefans that 
Michael has been working on and announcing through this list.  I'm 
looking for info on what people are willing to pay for hotels, etc. I'll 
forward your mail, or answer it.  I can give good info on Euro travel 
car/train/plane/bus in general if need be.  R/DLL
