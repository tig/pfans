I'm in the market for an early 70's 911 coupe.  A 2.2 E or a 2.4 E or
T, or a 69-73 car with an interesting motor.  I'll be using the car
for autocross, driver's ed, and street driving, so suspension goodies
(swaybars, shocks, torsion bars, etc) are a plus, and things like A/C,
sunroof, leather interior, and a concours paint-job are of little
interest.  Flares are a BIG plus.  Color isn't a major issue; I don't
care for Guard's Red, and I'd love a fly-yellow or dark blue.
Proximity to San Francisco is also a plus, as travel/shipping will add
to my costs.

I'm not looking to spend a mint, so that '73 RS is out of the
question.  Nor am I looking for a project car--I need something I can
start driving regularly as soon as I take title.  I might, however, be
able to swing a deal on a good motor, so an otherwise great car with a
blown motor is a possibiltiy.

If you've got such a car for sale, or know of someone who does, please
drop me a line, or give me a call.

Thanks

For those of you who pay attention to such things, yes, I was looking
for a 3.2 Carerra a few months back.  Once I drove a few of them, I
changed my mind: they're too heavy, and too civilized.  I loved the
power and tractability, but found myself thinking about pulling out
the A/C and looking for manual-crank windows.  Just seems foolish to
spend $25K on a car and then start ripping it up.  Better to get an early
car for less than half the price and drop in a 3.2....
