'80 911SC Targa
209,000 miles and stumbling
******************************************

My 911SC has developed a low speed miss (misfire?). I'd appreciate any
suggestions as to its cause.

About 2-3 weeks ago, I noticed (felt) the enigne missing. It felt like
perhaps one plug not firing about once every minute. A few days later, I
noticed that when this happened (idleing at 900 rpm) the Tach would
would kick up to ~1100 rpm. Since then the missing has gotten more
frequent now up to once every few seconds when idleing.

In addition, the the engine speed range where the missing occurs has now
risen to a bit below 2000 rpm. The engin pulls strongly and there is no
evidence on it missing at speeds above 2000 rpm.

Believing it to be bad plug wires (yes they were the originals from
1980), I had the plug wires replaced. No change. (actually there was
change, My wallet is $325 lighter). I will be taking the car back for
more diagnostics, but my mechanic (Black Forest in San Diego--very
trustworthy) didn't have an obvious solution. 

Has anyone else on the list observed such symptoms. Better yet, can
anyone suggest where to look.

Thanx, Bob

You can get the fitting that you need for a few bucks from Dave Turner
Motorsports, a Pano advertiser for many, many years at 800-854-6640.  You need
an SAE fine thread bolt to screw into the 'trans' tunnel and a triangular
piece with a hole for that bolt and a slot on the other end for the belt.  You
can also use a bolt with an eyelet and a clip on the end of your belt to clip
on and off the eyelet, if the seat doesn't get in the way.  Make sure you
follow the directions for wrapping the belt, otherwise it may work/pull out.
You can also get harnasses with the proper fittings already sewn on.

For the outboard side, you can use the seatbelt attachment point also.  There
are two options for the sub strap.  You can drill a hole under your seat and
sound some larg washers or reinforcements or you can use a dual sub strap with
one side going to each of the two lap belt mounting points.  It works well but
some sanctioning groups don't care for it as they feel there should be unique
mounting points for safety.  Dave Turner can fix you up with the straps,
fittings, etc. also, at least for Simpson systems.

A word of caution:  cars with harnasses but no roll bar/cage are dangerous in
the event of a rollover as the harnass holds you upright whereas the seat belt
allows you to bend to the side.  This is a real concern and some clubs will
strongly discourage, drivers with just harnasses from participating in high
speed driving events, although the concern is equally valid on the road.
