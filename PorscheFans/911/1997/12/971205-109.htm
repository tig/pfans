Brad,

I have a 70 911 T with a 901 and 205/60 -15 tires on 15 x 6 Fuchs.  At
4000 RPM in 5th I am going about 88 mph (calculated, indicated is a few
mph faster).  My 5th gear is 29:22 and my ring and pinion is 7:31.  4000
RPM in 4th is about 72 mph.  My 4th gear is 27:25.

Porsche offers many different gear sets ,at least I know they did back
when our cars were built, so your gear ratios may be as delivered from
the factory.  If you pick up a copy of the technical specifications
booklet for your car, it will list the various gearsets which were
available.  I think if you get cardex info on your car it may reveal
whether the car came with optional gear ratios.

I hope this helps some.

In my '68 911T, stock 2.0 and 901 transmission, I'm hitting 4000RPM at
120km/h (75mph) in 5th gear. Is this a normal reading, or is it possible
that I have lower than normal gears in the transmission? The previous
owner used to autocross it, but maintains the transmission has never
been modified any differently than from factory stock. Just curious, the
car seems fine with it.

Thanks in advance for any replies:
