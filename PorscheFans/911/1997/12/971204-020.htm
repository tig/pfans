Ok, no good leads from the list for replacement brushes for the blower
motor in the engine compartment.  How about this one:  Does anyone
know where the two resistors (.85 and 2.3 Ohms) for the two defroster
blower motors are physically located on the car?  These resistors
provide the variable load for the three position rotary switch located
between the seats on an '84 Carerra with manual heater controls.  I'm
starting to suspect the "Heating Control Unit Relay" has gone south . The
local dealer wants $167 for one......anyone out there know of another
source?    Good thing I'm in SoCal with all these blower troubles....TIA.

With all of this discussion on limited slip differentials, I was wondering how
you can tell if you have an LSD.  Isn't there a way of rotating the wheels
while on jackstands to determine if you have an open or limited slip diff?
The reason I ask is that since I put a used 915 in my car, it seems to plow
more around tight corners.  I'm wondering if this is my imagination or
possibly that I got a tranny with an LSD.
Thanks for any insight,
