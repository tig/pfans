Hello,

I've been meaning to ask about this since this discusion began a few
weeks ago, but didn't want to spark a discussion too far off the subject

of 911's (I would have sent this directly to Perry, but his message
doesn't have a return address): Where can I find out more about Dr.
Ferry Porsche's
involvement in German tank design?  As an Armor officer, stationed in
Germany, and the owner of a Porsche, I'm very interested in finding out
more about this subject.  I know he was heavily involved in the various
tank designs, but the only direct reference I've seen to him was the
design of the King Tiger tank turret that was not adopted (I think he
forgot to put a machine gun in it).  I noticed your reference to his
involvement with the Maus tank, but had never heard anything about this
before.
    One question, was he the big pusher of a torsion bar suspension in
German tanks?  I find it somewhat amusing that my 911 uses the same
springs as my M1A1 (although the M1's are just a tad bigger).
