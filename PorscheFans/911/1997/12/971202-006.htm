I've got a 1997 993 with 4500 miles on it that was showing the exact same
symptoms, but usually when gently braking from about 60 down to 45 or 50.
Intermittent and very annoying.  The dealer could reproduce it (no surprise
there, right?), but they went ahead and replace the front rotors, and the
problem has disappeared.  Of course, now I have a new problem...the
steering wheel vibrates from 55-65 mph.  I think that must be wheel
balance, but it's interesting that it only started doing it after the
rotors were replaced.

Anyway, the braking problem completely disappeared witht he new rotors.  I
guess the guy who had it for the first 4200 miles really must have over
cooked the front rotors.  I would think that would be hard to do, but....

good luck.
