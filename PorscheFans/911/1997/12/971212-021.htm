Actually, I implied nothing like that at all. All I aid was that
MacPherson strut suspension and torsion bars are not comparable.

All doumentation I have seen says that 911's have MacPherson strut frint
suspension. The torsion bar is carried in the wishbone tube of the A-arm
(it is positioned longitudenally).

I guess you can take that position. But I would not begin to suggest that
Ford invemted the automobile just because he perfect mass production of
them.

You make a lot of assumptions with out many facts. I do not know who first
invented torsion bars or who first used torsion bars successfully. But I
can tell you that I never did hear that Porsche was the one that did.  For
all I know the first torsion bar suspension was used in the buggy or
stagecoach days.
