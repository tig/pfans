Can anyone give me any suggestions on changing the #6 plug?  I am reaching

over the ac compressor, under an oil line or two and then trying to get my

full sized, grown up, adult hand and wrist into a space that isn't big
enough!



I use a Sears, locking, 3" extension on my plug socket and then extend that

with a short universal to reach far enough into the valve cover.  I then
fight

to get the rachet on and off of the universal as the combination is too long

to get out of the spark plug opening.



Suggestions?  Thanks for any and all advice.

-----------------------
Your post indicated that you attach a 3" extension, then a universal joint,
in that order, to the sparkplug socket.  It would go better if your universal
joint attached to the socket, then the extension. 

I've been changing plugs for a number of years and find that what currently
works best for me is the following: a Craftsman spark plug socket with a
built-on universal joint, followed by a short exension (I don't have it in
front of me, can't be sure of the length, maybe 2"), followed by an adapter
sold by Snap-On which adds perhaps a half-inch and has a knurled ring which
allows you to remove the plug by hand after it has been loosened.  I have
welded the 2" extension to the universal on the sparkplug socket, having had
the socket come loose inside the sparkplug recess many times.  For the socket
wrench I use a stubby Craftsman 3/8" with a flex handle and a quick release.
 The stubby wrench provides enough torque to loosen the plug and follow up
with a few turns before detaching the wrench and finishing removing the plug
with the knurled ring attachment.

On #6, fold the made-up attachment at the U-joint, insert it first and work
the remainder around the corner and use the knurled end to fit the socket
onto the plug.  Always manuever the socket to the lower left part of the
sparkplug recess where you'll find the plug.  *Then* attach the socket wrench
and loosen the plug.  After you feel the plug to be sufficiently loose,
remove the socket wrench with the quick release, and finish by hand.  

When installing the plug, use the made-up socket alone to get the plug
started by hand, then attach the wrench to tighten.  When you're done, you
can fold up the wrench and the attachment and pull it all out in one piece
rather than having to detach the wrench from the attachment, thereby saving a
little hassle and time.

Someone else may have a better way -- If so, please share it with the group

Hope this helps,
