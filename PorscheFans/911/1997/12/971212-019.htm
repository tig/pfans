This site is Godsent for me!
I owned a 356B years ago (when I was single).  I have forgotten all that I
knew (which was little) and the technology has come so far that I am really
lost when dealing with my, recently purchased, 1976, 911S.

This is my third question in a bit over a month of ownership and I have really
appreciated the help.

Now, for my question.

Oil pressure - I show slightly in excess of 60 lbs at 3000 RPMs which drops
off to slightly under 20 lbs at idle (950 RPMs with oil temperature at or
about 190).  For an engine with 74.5K, I think this is OK but could or would
anyone care to comment?  Oil consumption seems to be OK and the plugs looked
generally clean when I changed them (with the exception of #3 which had a bit
of fouling which is identified in the Haynes Manual as oil additive fouling -
which, again, they say is caused by valve guide degradation (?).  Any
comments?

Again, Thanks in advance.
