I had the same problem on my 90 C4 during the colder months in boston...
the brakes worked fine, it was that the light was on.. the manual said that
this was "normal".. its not doing any harm... btw, you may look into
replacing the green anodized pressure switch/relay in the pump itself...
mine died and started puking brake fluid all over the boot at 900psi...
they have been superceeded by a newer part... with this replacement, the
pressure seems to not have the problem of long build up times...
