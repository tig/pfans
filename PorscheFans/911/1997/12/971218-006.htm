Hi folks,

Having put $1800 in my beloved 83 Sc over the past 3 weeks, I am fairly
annoyed that something else seems to have crept up... I know, it comes
with the car, it's just that I felt I deserved a break right now for at
least 2 or 3 weeks !  ;-) 

There seems to be a gear noise (and I won't even attempt to describe
that one), that can be heard only when "lugging" the car. Basically in
second gear under 2000 rpm (1600 to 2000 basically), and pretty much the
same in 3rd gear... it's kind of like some metal against metal
vibration/ring noise/space time continuum disturbance...slightly higher
pitch than the engine...anyway...

PO's wife had trashed the gearbox so the car had a month old new 1st and
2nd gear syncro + new clutch when I got it. Maybe some shavings from
those new syncros ? 
Tomorrow, I am replacing the tranny oil and putting some good Redline
stuff in there, and will examine the shavings in the old oil... Can
anyone think of some kind of explanation ? Hopefully one that does not
involve spending another Grand ?

Absolutely fine above 2100 rpm, so the easy answer would be "keep it
there", but traffic is what it is and sometimes you must lug a little,
and once you hear a noise, you strive to recreate it !! ;-) 

Muchos TIA,

Greg.  83 SC
65 Karmann ghia..thankfully operational again !
