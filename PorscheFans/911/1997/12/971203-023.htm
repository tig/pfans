Hi all;

Though I'd add a few to the thread. Double-clutching on downshifts was
done in non-syncro transmissions to align the gears more easily for
shifting into a lower gear.  This was done in racing to make up for the
crummy brakes most cars had in the *olde days*. The Brits had to do this
or plot the field off the track. 

Now, the good Professor invented a type of syncronizer used in all
Porsche-type tranaxles up to the advent of the G-50. This minimized the
necessity to double-clutch, in fact, most reviewers of the early
Porsches were impressed by the shifting ease of the Porsche transaxle.

Now this necessity is also reduced by the fact that the Professor and
his son, the Docktor, believe that all Porsches should have outstanding
brakes. This was a big help in tight, slow corners. All you have to do
is stomp the brake, shift down into the correct gear and accelerate from
the corner, something we can do easily in any Porsche.

Heres the caveat: Match the rpm as you downshift. Don't just grab a gear
and dump the clutch. Bring the engine rpm up to match the driveshaft
speed (Porsches have two or more). This relieves strain on the
connecting rods, transmission pieces and your wallet. Heel-and-toeing
was originally for fast double-clutching, but now should be practiced to
match rpm as you shift down. 

Have fun
Jim Pasha
