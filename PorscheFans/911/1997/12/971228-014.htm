Hi PFans,
   I know there was a post and a description for lowering the rear of a
911 Turbo some time back. I have gone through the archives but was
unable to locate it.
If there is anyone with the post or where I can find it I would really
appreciate it. If there is anyone who care to reiterate what is involved
that would be even more appreciated.

Thanks

Just relocated to Jacksonville FL from Monterey CA and the car transport
company did a pretty good number on my car.  To add insult to injury the
shipment took almost 30 days and seemed to be under a storm cloud the entire
time.  So- not only does my four month old paint job look horrible, the engine
is running rough to boot.  First things first, the engine is hard to start,
runs rough and seems to have lost a lot of power.  Come monday I plan on
replacing the plugs first, then on to the distributor cap and rotor (plus
points).  The car is a 72S with carbs, does this seem like a good place to
start?  Secondly, anyone know of a good mech in the Jacksonville area,
preferably in the Orange Park, Mandarin area?  Lastly, any recommendations on
a good body/paint shop in town?  Any comments or suggestions e-mail to
Boog87@aol.com Thanks,
Chris Powell
