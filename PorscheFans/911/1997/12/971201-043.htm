Randy says one of his Zenith carbs spills fuel into the the venturi, and
then out along the throttle shaft after he shuts off his engine (and into his
crankcase also!).  He describes this with admirable Sgt. Joe Friday sang
froid.  I had a spectacular engine fire when, on starting an engine whose
carbs had been drained, the electric fuel pump pushed fuel out along that
route while I was priming things.  Gave a whole new meaning to "fire it
up."  Almost got the garage.

I initially thought I had forgotten to tighten a fitting, but not so.  The route
of escape was pointed out to me by the firemen who responded and
noticed some gas still coming out near throttle shafts despite my having
gotten the fire out.

Greg (like me, not a Zenith man) postulates that there must be a check
valve in the idle circuit, since the float level is well above the idle and
progression ports.  While I haven't memorized Weber circuits to where I
could reproduce the molds, I do know that the idle jets on a Weber are at
the top of the carb, above the float level I think.  Isn't it the strong vacuum
at idle or even progression hole's ville that sucks (ok, allows air to push)
the gas up above the bowl level, throught the idle jet, and then back
down?  Just as the weaker signal at WOT pulls it up, just less far, into
the main nozzle?

After my adventure, as seems so often to be the case, various folks
kindly told me things like this can happen whenever you drain your carb,
which somehow can cause the float to stick open, although no one
knew just what the mechanism of sticking was.  Never happened during
all those many main jet changes at the track.  Maybe residual old gas
acts like glue?  Now I push car out of garage, pressurize and tap carbs
with a mallet, and watch carefully before first ignition after rebuilds and
the like.

In Randy's case I don't quite know what would cause there to be
pressure in the fuel system after his engine is turned off, and glue
hypothesis obviously wrong for him.  But still I'd check into notion of
stuck or binding float valve/float and residual pressure (mainly because it
is the only poor thought I have to offer from my typically disasterous
experiences).

Zenith owners need to pipe up and pitch in to help him rather than leave
him to the tender mercies of the unwashed.
