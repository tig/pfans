Ok folks here it is, the question asked as often as any other. For
christmas I recieved the gift of a trip to Europe. Now, having never been
out of the country, I am anctious to head for Germany, the Autobahn, and of
course a few laps of the famed Nurburgring.

I very much want to rent either a Boxster, or 911 while there for a day or
two. I called both Hertz, and Avis but neither company was much help other
than saying that they thought there were Boxsters available, BUT they did
not have availability, or price information. Anybody actually in Germany
who might be able to help me out here? Anybody have any experience with
Porsche rentals? I thought I remembered someone saying Avis had 911's for
somewhere around $150-$175 a day, but that was about a year ago.

ANY, and all help would be VERY much appreciated.
Thank you
