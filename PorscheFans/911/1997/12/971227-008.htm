I have been looking at wheels and I was wondering if you compared the Kinesis mesh wheel vs. HRE's?  On a lowered
930 with 17" rims, how is the ride?  I'm currently running the 930 lowered with stock wheels and the ride is how you
say, firm. Do you get any tire rub with the new wheels?

> European taillights

Nice touch, specially on a black 930.

> 1+ Bar adjustable boost system

Adjustable boost systems sound interesting, I have though a lot about a system like that but I wonder when would I
want less boost ;-)   This does bring up an interesting question,  when does a car have too much boost?  I'm sure
most 930 owners  have seen the horror picture in Bruce's "911 Performance Handbook" of the melted pistons from an
over-boosted 930.  Does it make sense to have a sensor and gauge for cylinder temperature?

Sounds like this would really reduce spool time on the old turbo.  Did you make these upgrades one at a time and
observe performance differences for each upgrade?

> SS brake lines

I have read several articles that discuss the merits of different types of material for brake lines, are the SS
lines DOT approved?  Did the pedal feel change vs. the stock lines?

> Nology Performance HotWires

I've seen the adds for Nology's spark plug wires but haven't seen anything about their design or construction.  Do
they interfere with the radio?

Sounds like you have been very busy with your 930 this fall.  What's in store for '98?  Turbo or maybe an inter
cooler?

Bruce, there is a possible solution.  I had similar problems with my old
'76 and '84 911s.  Found that in the parts manual/microfiche Porsche
has a special plug that fits these sockets.  So, you can buy a couple and 
replace all of the plugs on your accessories, or buy one and buy a standard
socket at a local auto parts store and wire up an adapter by joining the
two with wire.

The factory plug is an nice high quality unit; high quality fittings and 
two halves are bolted together.  I didn't have a problem with plug
wiggling out of socket with this unit.  Unfortunately, got rid of my manuals
 when sold above cars, so don't have part no. available.  A lister or the 
dealer should be able to help.

(reply to:)

Both our 944 (now my wifes) and the 911 have cigarette lighter sockets which
are too shallow for virtually all adapter plugs we have.  Radar detectors,
CB radios, computer adaptor plugs, even little air compressors adaptors plop
out at the slightest jarring.

Does anyone have a simple solution?  There must be one.  If I can buy an
adaptor which allows 4 things to be plugged in where only one lighter went,
I should think that someone has developed a way to plug a deep adaptor into
a shallow socket.

Thanks in advance.
