Hi Terry,

I test fit 245/45/16 on the back of my '70 911.  They where mounted 
on 16 x 7" wheels.  They rubbed on hard cornering.  I could of rolled 
the fender wells for a fit, but decided not to.  I ended up going w/ 
the 16 x 6 fuchs, fitted with 205/55/16 tires.  I think 225's would 
easily fit, if you can find them in 50 series.

Take Care,
Ken
