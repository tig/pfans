Pfans,
Two problems.....question is are they related.
(1)  Wipers refuse to "park" back at full left position.
(2)  Intermittent wiper function has ceased to work.  

All other aspects of wiper operations work perfectly.

I suspected the rotating disk with the contacts were dirty on the small
gear box between the motor and the mechanical wiper assembly.  After
a painful process to gain access, I found they were in pretty good
shape.   I thoroughly cleaned the disk and contacts, with negative
results.   I now suspect the "Pulse Generator," which from the lousy
schematic in Haynes, is much more than that.  I would appreciate any
ideas or experiences with similar problems.

BTW, I just finished sorting out some problems with the various heater
blower motors and the two relays that control them on an 84 Carrera
with manual heater controls.  If anyone has a question drop me a line. 
TIA for any info on my wipers, but hurry.... El Nino is coming!

One last item:  the best tool for removing spark plugs is the tool that
comes with the car...works great!
