Nick Cole asks how hard it would be to convert a 73 2.4 to CIS.  If it was
a mechanically fuel injected engine, he might be better with Webers,
because he'd have to change the heads or have them machined.  While
he could plug off the fuel injection ports in the MFI heads easily enough,
the CIS injectors not only plug into the intake manifold, they do it so close
to the head that the top of the port has a relief in it.  The MFI heads didn't
have this relief, so heads would have to be changed or relief added.  I
don't think the CIS injectors can be inserted in the MFI heads as they are -
the hole for MFI is narrower, and isn't it threaded?

Now if he owns a 73 T engine which came with CIS, different story.
