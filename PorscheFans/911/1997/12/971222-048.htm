Bill Kline asks what to use to block off the various lines when removing
an engine.  Others may have better thoughts to contribute.  I start with a
collection of miscellaneous caps and cap-like plastic thingies I have
accumulated over the years and try to press them on or into (if large) the
various lines.  This is not so much to keep fluids from leaking out as to
keep dirt, dust, and other crud from getting in.  On my race car I use
plastic AN male and female caps (actually cheap), but all the fittings on a
street car are metric, and I have never seen metric plastic caps.  The fuel
filters come with press-on caps, so that covers one fitting if you saved
it.  Lacking things which press on and stay on, masking tape works just
fine (duct tape is too gooey - you don't particularly want residue on
fittings).

For dribbles, you will get some gasoline out of the fuel lines, but shouldn't
be more than one shop rag will hold per line, so put a rag in there when
you loosen each one.  Despite your best draining efforts, you will get
some dripping from the oil lines.  I usually stuff some paper towling in the
ends and put a pan under them to catch the drips which get by that. 
Pulling these out at time of reinstallation will pull any dirt back out at same
time.  If you have a plug which fits an oil line, fine, but be prepared to
catch some more oil which has accumulated when eventually you
remove it.

You asked about anti-seize. You could use a little anti-seize on all the
metal to metal fittings, but the only ones I think are critical (which are not
part of a routine engine or engine and tranny R&R) are the steel "nuts"
attaching the lines to the aluminum external oil thermostat.  I think most of
these fittings either stay oily, stay dry generally, or get hot and so don't
stay wet, so rusting isn't much of a problem.  Last time I replaced
injectors, though, some of them seemed a bit rusty in the fittings so I
used anti-seize there.

One hour out, one hour in is my best time to date for the engine/tranny
assembly on the carbureted race car, but I have worked it over to make
this doable, and didn't futz around because I was timing myself.  Took me
better part of an afternoon on the '77 w/3.0 CIS recently (two CV bolts
stripped the Allen on one CV despite what I thought was best care),
including removing the valance at the end when I found I couldn't get it
past that without standing the car even farther up than I already had it
and decided that was easier to do than more teetery raising of car
toward limit of jack stand travel.  Seems to me in past I had left the
valance on, but it is only a dozen or less little bolts.

When you finally lower your engine, do it slowly (duh - of course you
will do this because you will fear the whole thing will somehow tip over
and fall down) and check to see if you may have forgotten to disconnect
something.  Ditto when you start pulling the engine back and it moves a
bit and feels like it doesn't want to come farther.  You can imagine how I
came to offer this advice.
