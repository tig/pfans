My apology if this posted correctly the first time, my copy came back with
nothing but question marks.

On the way to the shop for an alignment my balky shifter refused to go into
any gear, twice. It wouldn't move into any forward gear and gnashed loudly
when I tried reverse. The shop looked at it and turned out that the clutch
was so far gone that it was eating the flywheel. I always thought that a
clutch would start to slip before it got that far. My question is, How can
you tell when a clutch needs replacement ? My shop looked at the car for
balky shifting 6 months ago and they didn't see the warning signs either.
By the way, this is a reputable shop.
