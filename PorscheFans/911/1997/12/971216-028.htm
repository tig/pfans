Hello,

I recently purchased a 1980 911SC Targa.  I have previously owned a 928 =
but I've always desired a 911 Targa.  I love the car very much - it runs =
great and looks great.  The exterior is dark metallic brown and  the =
interior is dark brown leather.  I'd like to do the maintenance and =
minor repairs myself.   (BTW, I'm new to this mailing list)

I have several questions regarding the care and restoration of my car:

*Is there an easy way to fix small scrapes on the leather dash?  These =
are the common fingernail scrapes near the top of the steering wheel.   =
Despite these marks the dash is in great shape.

*The leather seats are in good shape but there is some ware near the =
driver door.  Can this be repaired?  (I'm thinking that something like a =
matching boot polish would work.)  Are there "leather kits" available =
for this type of thing?

*Can someone recommend a good cleaner/protector for the leather?

*Is there a good  cleaner/protector for the exterior Targa top?  (i.e. =
Amoural?)  (The top is about 1 year old).

*Can someone recommend a good cleaner for the Fuchs alloy wheels which =
won't damage them?

*Are the factory repair manuals as good or better that Haynes?  (i.e.  =
Eventually I want to be able to do my own valve adjustments, filter/belt =
changes, brake jobs, etc.)  Are there any recommended do-it-yourself =
body/engine repair manuals available?

*The driver's side window glass height requires adjustment so that it is =
flush with the Targa top.  Does anyone have any tips on this?  The glass =
sets a little too low.  The seals are in good shape.

*There is some light surface rust on and around the battery tray.  Any =
suggestions on fixing this?  I'm not interested in a concours car, I =
just want to clean up the rust so it doesn't spread.  My guess is that =
it needs to be cleaned with baking soda and water, then wire =
brushed/sanded and a rust inhibitor applied.

*The AC doesn't work.  For now I was thinking of stripping off the =
compressor and condenser.  Are there any problems doing this?  It seems =
as though rain water would leak through the vents on the engine =
compartment door cover  and onto the engine if the condenser was absent.

Thanks very much - any info is greatly appreciated!
