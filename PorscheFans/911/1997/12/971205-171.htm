Thanks for the advice my question about whether my cam timing could be
off.  The consensus seems to be that it's probably not.  Several people
suggested a constricted exhaust.  This is possible since I was hit in
the rear, but I question because I drove it 15 miles to the repair shop
after the accident.  Of course, the accident could have knocked
something loose, and it then fell of inside while they were doing the
repairs.  The first thing I want to try and do is drain the gas tank (it
sat at 1/4 tank for the 6 months) and refill it.  I've drained some gas
from it, and it seemed a little darker then normal, but no foreign
matter in it.  I've replaced the fuel filter with no noticable effect
(by the way, it's more expensive to buy a Bosch filter in Germany from a
Bosch dealer then it is to order one in the states, same for Sachs
clutches, even theough we have a Sachs factory in town).
    Thanks for the advice, I'll check it out when I get a chance (new
job, working late) and report back to the group.
