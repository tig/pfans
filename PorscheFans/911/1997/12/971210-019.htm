Hi Folks, I have some pretty basic questions about my engine. The engine =
is a 74 2.7. I have only recently purchased the car and have run into a =
couple of problems. The first thing I noticed was that you can move the =
Injectors in their positions with the engine off. They appear to be =
staked into place, that is to say that there is a small indentation that =
prevents them from coming out. While the engine is idling, they seem to =
be pretty tight though you can still press them down, it's just more =
difficult. Is this normal? If not how do I fix it? Heck I can't see any =
easy way to get them out! If anyone could provide some information I =
would be grateful.
