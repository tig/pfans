Denny,

You may well be on the right track.  I've done a fair amount of research on
O2 sensors and an aged sensor has a tendency to indicate a "lean" mixture
and lead to rich running.  If you disconnect the sensor, the DME will go
into an open loop operation and will run according to the engine condition
(e.g., idle mixture, false air leaks . . .).  This will likely be better
than your overly rich running.

I too replace the sensor with a generic and it works fine.  You can tell
the condition of the sensor by using a digital multimeter.  In general, the
voltage should be between 0 and 1 volt, where close to 0v indicates lean
and close to 1v indicates rich.  The DME adjusts to keep the voltage at
..5v, although it never really stays there.  You should see a fast,
fluctuating series of numbers that seems to average about .5v.

By hooking up the multimeter next to the driver's seat, I've been able to
monitor the functioning while driving.  This has been particularly useful
for setting the idle mixture.  To set the mixture, I drive the car until
warm, and with the O2 sensor disconnected from the DME, but connected to
the digital multimeter, I can read the voltage as the car comes to idle.  I
reset the mixture, drive a little more, let the car idle, then reset the
mixture again.  Eventually I end up with a reading of about .5v the quickly
rises and falls between .7v and .2v.

I hope some of this is helpful, let me know if you have more questions.
