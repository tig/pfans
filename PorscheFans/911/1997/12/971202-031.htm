Alex - open rear deck lid.  below and to the right of the fan housing at the
rear (closest to you) of the engine you'll see two sensors.  One sticks up
out of a metal block which is attached to a black hose which goes
horizontally over to the right and oils the cam etc.  That is the oil pressure
sensor.  The temp sensor is to the left of that and sticks straight back out
of the engine (not that it sticks out much).

I agree with your diagnoses, all of them, and the order you obviously are
going to try to deal with it.  I am pretty sure that the oil pressure sensor is
just a wire wound rheostat, so contact wear can mess it up over time.  I
am not sure about the oil temp sensor, and suspect that because of its
smaller size it is just a resistor which changes values depending on
temperature, which should mean it doesn't wear out.

While I'd think it unlikely, you can pull the gauge out of the dash with your
fingers to confirm that its connections are all in order, positive, ground,
and signal.  Or you could attach a potentiometer (maybe 500 ohms - I
measured this once but can't remember) to the wire back at the sender
and to ground to see if the gauge went up and down smoothly as the pot
was turned.  The guts of the temp gauge can also be removed from the
housing entirely, but I learned nothing by peering at mine - it isn't
designed to be taken apart any further.
