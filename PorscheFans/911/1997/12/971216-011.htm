Greg,
  Can't help you with the smoke. When mine used to do that
I called it my "German Mosquito Abatement Program".

Euro models came with a  fog light that hung down under the
left side of the rear bumper, if the car is a Euro and missing that fog
light...
(Euro models have those little 1x2" side marker lights in the front fenders 
between the door and wheel well.)

 The Haynes manuals is a must have of course. You can get the manual for
your car (911SC)  on fiche for about $25. I bring my fiche to the library
and print out whatever I need for the project. Fiche copies are $.25 a piece
so it's still not cheap. Some other helpful books starting with the most 
necessary:

"911SC Technical Reference" (something like that) small 3x4" booklet with all
the
    torque specs and sundry things like gear ratios and alignment specs. ~$10
(Porsche)
"911 Parts and Technical Reference Manual" (something like that) This is a
available 
    from the the dealer for about $10. It has exploded views of various
things and is
    very helpful when it comes to figuring out which part you need. It seems
to
    be more complete than the parts fiche the dealer has. (Porsche)
"911 Performance Handbook" by Bruce Anderson's ~$20? (Motorbooks) 
"Bosch Fuel Injection" (something like that) by Probst isn't as necessary as
    the above books but it's nice to have. It does a good job of explaining
    CIS fuel injection.

Stoddard should have the fiche and Porsche books and probably Bruce's.  
Moffet's (advertises in Excellence) should have the books also.  Bruce's 
book is hands down the most interesting.

 hoping you get all the books you want for Christmas,
  Chris
