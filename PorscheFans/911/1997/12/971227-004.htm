I could use some input / advice.

On Wed. Dec. 24 I was heading home from work in my 72 911T and noticed =
the oil pressure gauge was reading very low.  <SNIP>


Jon:

	It sounds like you caught the low oil problem before any damage was done. 
Modern oils are very good - much better now than 5 years ago, and
generations better than 33 years ago when your engine was designed.  Oil
has additives designed to provide lubrication during cold starts before the
oil gets pumped to all the engine parts.  You actually have good
lubrication for quite a while after you loose oil.  Witness the "8 hours in
a New York taxi" ads for oil addatives - don't buy their snake oil, but the
ads show that an engine run for a long time without oil, as long as the
engine is not under heavy load.

	The bearings are usually the first to get damaged when oil pressure goes
away.  From what I have seen in engines torn down after this has happened,
over-temperature causes most of the damage.  Oil cools, as well as
lubricates the bearings.  As long as you did not get hot enough to burn
away the oil that was there before you lost pressure, you are fine.  If you
smell charred oil when you drain the engine, you might worry.  If the gage
was reading low, but not zero, you were still getting fresh cool oil the
the bearings, along with air that was getting sucked into the pump.  Fix
the oil line, and stop worrying.  And watch that gage.

		Happy new year!

The main reason NOT to run them on the street is that
while legal, they are NOT designed as a street tire. 
The Team T/A news has mentioned this.

Many people have gotten bad sidewall cracks from driving them
on the street, and some tire failures. Maybe due to running
at too low pressures (which work for autox but not good on the
street as load range is drastically reduced). Also they
are very uncomfortable on the street.

Howdy, I'd be glad to. 

You've probably heard that racers tend to "scrub in" tires by actually taking
them out on the track for a couple of laps to heat them up. The tires are then
allowed to cool or  cure. They've found that the tread wear of a tire
decreased significantly during a race if the tires were "heat cycled" prior to
the race.

BF Goodrich has done extensive testing with their Comp T/A R1's. They heat
cycled tires using several methods. They then took several drivers out to a
rough concrete oval track had let each driver wear out a set of each type of
heat cycled tire and a set of non heat cycled tires. They found that heat
cycled tires got 50% more laps before wearing out. They also measured lap
times and found that there was no decrease (or increase) in performance due to
heat cycling.

At Trackside Products we have been heat cycling tires for several months.
We're very impressed with the initial results. No one has actually worn out
our heat cycled tires yet. We're doing the process for both street and track
applications. For $12.50 a tire is seems like a cheap way of extending tire
life. I'm paying special attention to my customers spending $1000-1400 on
Bridgestone SO2's and other more expensive tires.

I hope that helps
