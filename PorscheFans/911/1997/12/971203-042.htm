Hi,

I just bought a Pertronix ignitor from GPR Parts as well as a cap and
rotor set. I replaced the cap and rotor which was a rather revealing
adventure. I am surprised my car even ran. Two of the six spark plug
wire leads were completely covered with corrosion. I cleaned the leads
and swapped everything out and now the car seems to be running better
(at least during my 5 minute run around the block). 

Now I would like to install the Pertronix unit. My only question is were
to find the fuel pump lead to hook up the positive wire of the pertronix
unit. Do I wire it at the fuel pump itself, or is there a circuit in the
engine compartment to which I can attach the postive wire? Also, since I
don't have a timing light, would it be okay to get the car timed by
mechanic at a nearby gas station, or should I drive the 25 miles to get
my semi regular mechanic to time the car, or better yet should I trust
myself with a new timing light?

Thanks for any advice you can give me.
