Hi Greg,

Maybe this will make you feel better ... I have a '91 C4 daily 
driver/driver's ed car with 60k miles. Until last Fall it was quiet and 
solid. Then I took it to a driver's ed at Gingerman in Michigan and flogged 
it harder than I ever had before in pursuit of a pair of extra seconds 
trying to match a friend's RS America time.

Bottom line, I finally broke the dual mass part of the dual mass flywheel. 
On the 964 this part absorbs, I think, up to 30 degrees of rotational 
mismatch and apparently reduces a lot of gear noise. Now, when I lug the 
engine, say driving in 3rd at a fair clip and braking hard to under 2500 
rpm and then getting back on the gas without shifting I get a sound best 
described as large marble sized ball bearings being rotated at moderate 
speed around the inside of an empty coffee can.

I took it to my mechanic -- experienced Porsche shop. Aside from the 
dual-mass problem they said that the noise was gear noise, wasn't really 
that bad, and I should learn to live with it if I could. If you hear the 
same noise I hear it then we experience it more viscerally than they did, 
or than passengers do. Earlier today I had a guy in my car and said "listen 
to this loud annoying gear noise", lugged it, cringed and he said "what 
noise?".

I plan to replace the dual-mass flywheel and may even have some carefully 
chosen gear set installed to help me out at the track. But in the meantime 
I try not to lug the engine.

Cheers,
-Ez Goldman
'91 Carrera 4
