Hi again P-fans,

Just as a reminder and for those who missed the previous post. =20
A few days back, I mentioned that I was planning to put up a web site=20
where people from this mailing list could get together and chat about =
repairs, experiences etc.

Well the site is up!. It's called the Porsche Fans Lounge. I have set up =
a test site for now. The site is done in frames. The chat room is up and =
running. . The chat program is pretty versatile. You can change your =
text color, include a picture. The refresh rate is quick and is easy to =
use. The e-mailer and main page are also up. The links page needs some =
additional URL's, if you want yours put there e-mail me with it. The =
link list is not categorized completely yet but will be soon.  I still =
have to get the other pages done before a complete polishing is done.  =
If you would like I need an Author for editorials.  Check the Archives =
page.  The pictures page, Guestbook, and Archives page has to be set up. =
I am also thinking about adding an e-mail directory of p-fans on the =
net.  Let me know if you want your address included.  I do have to make =
some finishing touches though. Please check it out, make any =
suggestions. Hopefully We can make this site a place to get together to =
socialize and have a good time. Here is the URL

http://www.globalserve.net/~dragyn/pfans=20
I look forward to your input

Thank you.

P.S. Anyone know how to turn off the double format sending on my =
e-mailer.  It's very irritating for my self and I'm sure everyone else =
to see my mail sent twice with the second message unreadable due to all =
the symbols.  So if anyone knows please e-mail me the solution....Thanks =
Again=20
