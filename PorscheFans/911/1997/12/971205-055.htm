Well,

Car: '82 911 SC Euro.

One day I heard a snap and my clutch pedal went to the floor and would
not come back.  Since then, I have replaced the clutch cable, the clutch
assembly, the fly wheel, rebuilt the pedal assembly with brass bushings,
and rebuilt the transmission.  Some of this was done by me, but most of
the large work was done by a mechanic who was recommended by three
different people off this list.  My personal impression is that he knows
what he is doing, though I am beginning to wonder.

Still, the pedal will not come back from the floor without coaxing.
Helper springs were the first items I replaced.  My mechanic says the
only thing he can think of is some tube has rotted somewhere and the
cable is either getting stuck blah blah blah.  Basically we have
replaced almost every moving part in line from the pedal to the clutch
with new and it still does not work.

This one is a real stumper so ANY ideas would be helpful.  And parting
out the car is not a helpful idea.....};(
