I agree with Gary's reply. I was told by John at Black Forest (San
Diego) that the sound occurs when the "thermostat" is partially open and
the oil is going through the thermostat constriction. When you hear it,
notw the position of your oil temp guage. I bet it only happens at a
unique temperature. The "water" sound is somewhat amusing--after all a
911 is air-cooled.
