In response to your question about changing to a single Optima battery in an eary 911, 
this is how I did it:   

In a '69 coupe, I put it in the battery box on the left side.  This allowed me to simply 
remove the extension cable which goes across to the right side box.  For balance reasons 
I would have preferred it on the right, but it can't be done because the battery sticks 
out of the box a little and there's not room on the right because the spare tire is 
offset to the right.  Also, that would have meant either replacing the battery cable 
with a longer one, not a happy thought since it has to run back to the starter, or 
insulating and leaving in place the positive terminal on the left side, also not a happy 
thought.     

The Optima will not stand upright - it's a little too high for the box.  However, this 
is no problem - the Optima is fully sealed and the manufacturer states that it can be 
mounted in any position.

So I laid it on its side, on a block of wood, with the terminals toward the front of the 
car and down; this puts the neg. terminal in the box and the pos. one out of the box and 
more accessible.  Think I had to change the ground cable - no big deal - I chose to go 
with a woven strap type which is more flexible than the cable type, handy when the strap 
is very short as in this case.  However, the strap type is not insulated, so be sure to 
dress it so that it can't possibly get near the positive terminal.  This was not 
difficult.  

To secure the battery, I used one of the black, stretchy rubber straps sold in hardware 
stores as luggage tie-downs.  I think that the right length is probably 12", or close to 
that.  I removed the wire hooks from both ends of the strap, then drilled a hole in the 
top of the old battery box.  This is none too easy - has to be done from under the front 
fender.  Then, using a small diameter bolt and a large washer, I bolted one end of the 
strap to the inside of the battery box at the top, using the hole where the original 
hook had been.

To secure the other end, I drilled a hole in the bottom pan near the battery and formed 
a smaller hook from one of the hooks I had removed from the rubber strap.  So the strap 
extends over the top of the battery (which is really the side, because it's laying on a 
side), then is stretched and the hole in the end of the strap is placed over the hook 
mounted on the bottom pan near the battery. 

Unfortunately, this isn't quite the end of it.  Although supported well in the 
box, the battery is still free to slide forward, and the positive terminal could touch a 
piece of the body metal.  To prevent this, I drilled another hole in the bottom pan and 
mounted an ordinary corner brace, common hardware variety, about 2" long each leg, one 
leg extending upward to prevent the battery from moving forward, the other leg shortened 
and bolted to the floor pan.  I shrunk a piece of electronic shrink tubing over the 
vertical leg which the battery could touch.  Any kind of tubing or even tape would do 
the job;  the insulation is only in the event the battery were severely jolted out of 
place, as in a hard collision, in which case the positive terminal could conceivably 
touch bracket.  Not at all likely, but when working with the power in a battery, it's 
best to allow for all possiblities, no matter how remote, and take no chances at all.

It sounds like a fair amount of work, and it was.  However, being able to run a single 
battery with cranking current equal to or greater than the two little batteries, made it 
all worth while.  And the greatest benefit of all:  a sealed battery!  No checking and 
adding water to 12 cells!  No more spilling acid, no more corroded front pans!  The 
front pan in this car had to be replaced, not due to rust from the bottom, but because 
of overflowing battery acid from the top.  These benefits, alone, made the job well 
worth while, in my estimation.
       
And the guarantee on the Optima is 72 months, I believe.  If anyone else works out an 
easier or cleaner installtion, I would like to hear about it.
