Hi Rob...

I have a 77 s, but it no longer has the stock 2.7 (now a 3.6).  If I were 
you, and if I had to do it all over again, I would hold out for the latest 
car I could afford, perhaps an mid 80's Carrera, or an early 80's SC.

Don't get me wrong, I'm quite happy with the car, and for a 20 year old 
car, it is holding up very well.  20 years takes a toll on suspension, 
body, interior....

I know that I spent a fortune on updates (86 susp, turbo wheels, tail, 
etc.) that might have already been done to/were stock on a later car.

Hello again P-fans.

I'm seriously looking at a 77 911s, with a rebuild @ 50,000 & chain
tensioners updated at the same time,also has a new clutch & new tires. 
Seems
to be pretty cherry. Oh yeah has 67,000 miles as of right now.What do guys
think? I think i can buy it for maybe $10,000 or do I hold out for a 78 SC
with 3.0. Man do I need some porsche advise today. Also has non factory 
a/c.
What do you think about that? I guess I'm getting tired of looking & almost
ready to take my chances. Who knows.

Thanks,

Rob Jones
