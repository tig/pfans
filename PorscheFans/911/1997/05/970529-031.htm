Scott,

>A bit of trivia: Does anyone know why 911 wipers come to rest on the
drivers side when turned off?  This is the opposite of virtually every
other wiper and usually results in an annoying streak on the driver's side
caused by the passenger-side wiper when they are turned off or during
intermittent mode.

The only thing I've heard is that the design objective is to clear the
driver's
side as quickly as possible once the wipers are activated and therefore,
despite all the natural advantages of parking them on the passenger side
(lack of final streak on the driver's side, clearer view forward when the 
wipers are parked, better chance to conveniently mount a radar detector,
others?), the .4 second delay in clearing the driver's-side view is viewed as
unnecessary and becomes simply intolerable to the German psyche.

It bugs me, too.  The only other cars I've seen with the wipers on the right
are right-drive Brit-cars.
