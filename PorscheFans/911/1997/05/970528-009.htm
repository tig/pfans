Hi all and sorry for the late response, but digests sometimes come 3 or 4
days late.

This is regarding learning to drive and the discussion on relative merits of
different tires.
I have done the grand sum of two autocrosses and read one how-to book so I
have minimal driving experience, but a very large amount of experience in
educating and training and I am one around which this discussion centers.

              "How easy is to learn to drive on street tires vs R compound
tires"

I have driven two different cars. 
My car is an 86 coupe equipped with adjustable sway bars, (rear much larger
than stock), adjustable Konis, plastic bushings, has been lowered, air flow
meter and chipped, and most pertinent to the discussion GSCs.  Installed by
PO.  I bought it like this.
My friend's car is a totally stock 78 SC and has never even been lowered with
Pirelli P7 street tire.  
They drive rather differently as you might imagine.

78 SC tends to oversteer more quickly, with less warning, at lower speeds and
is much more difficult to get back on line.  Nothing new or unexpected to
experienced drivers.
86 coupe is almost impossible to get to oversteer, but the rear is quite
sensitive to spins and full thottle.  Nothing new or unexpected to
experienced drivers

If the slip is gradual and one has time to either hear the instructor or
remember what you have read, it is much easier to LEARN.  
When I finally got my 86 coupe to understeer, (full throttle in second gear,
@5000 RPM on a skid pad) I had time to try different things.  1)Slightly
adjust steering wheel. 2)Or a slight tap on the brake or a 3)miniscule amount
of lift throttle oversteer. I was LEARNING to drive the car correctly.
I also LEARNED quickly not to even get close to oversteering the 78 SC.  It
breaks away too quickly for an inexperienced driver to respond at all, let
alone  respond accurately.
If you instructors want students to LEARN quickly, take them in your R-tire
equipped car and demonstrate these concepts.  We students have never felt
them and you definitely have to feel them. If it happens too quickly to feel
you can't learn.
My .02 worth and my new SA95 helmet arrived yesterday.  Can''t wait for the
next opportunity
