The thread a few weeks ago regarding the little ones begging (crying!)
to ride in the Poor-sha hit home with me.  Two recent stories you pfans
might appreciate:

1)	Christine (3.5 yr old girl) was at a pre-school field trip to
the fire station. The fireman is explaining how they help people who
have been in accidents. Christine says "My mom was in an accident." (see
http://www.kindel.com/Porsche/story.htm).  The fireman says "Oh, was she
injured?".  Christine: "My daddy got a new Poor-sha!". Needless to say,
my wife was not impressed with our daughter's priorities.

2)	I came home from work yesterday and went inside. My 16 month old
little boy came running for me, I bent down so I could hug him and he
went right by...out the garage door and into the garage. He stood next
to the Porsche pointing at it and screaming "Uh, uh, uh, uh!".  I opened
the passenger side door, he climbed in and sat on his little bottom. All
smiles. He sat there content-like for about 5 minutes and then climbed
out. Happy as can be.

I guess I don't rate anymore.

I bet he wants to drive the 911 too!  He's been waiting 9 months and 8
days for this.  ;-)
