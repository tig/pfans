....What a shame...or shall I say, what a SHAM!
     
Getting right down to the basics, a radar detector is a 'listening device'.
 It would seem logical to suggest that it would be an infringement of the
individual's constitutional rights by not allowing them to picking-up X/K 
band and Laser transmissions when they are being targeted, and do alter 
them in anyway.  I would also figure (through logistics, although logistics 
plays no part in law enforcement!) that a 'listening device' that does not 
interfere with the transmission of radar waves is totally acceptable.  What 
isn't acceptable is the 'highway robbery' of motorists wanting to 'listen' 
into a signal w/o actually altering its original format...Try arguing this 
in court.

     Sorry to report, but, "been there, done that!"  Long ago, laws banning 
     radar detectors were challenged, on essentially the constitutional 
     grounds you hypothesize, and the laws were upheld (unfortunately).
     
     What's more interesting is a recent comment from someone in NY state 
     to the effect that truckers care not allowed to have radar detectors, 
     while normal 2 axle vehicles are.  This sure would seem to violate the 
     14th Amendment of the Constitution, commonly known as the Equal 
     Protection clause.
     
     
Things are worse here in Canada.  A detector is immediately confiscated (or 
smashed on the road side in front of you...after making a survey of general 
intelligence and a quick 'will this civilian give me a hard time in court 
based upon my intimidating and lack of professional behavioral code'

     We're certainly flattered, but I must say, you seem to be in the 
     minority, compared with the Canadians I've met.  However, you're on 
     the Pfans list, so how bad could you be?  We'll take you!  Tell the 
     INS that Pfans sent you!
