There were 2 recent inquiries on lowering.  Yes, you need to re-index 
the splines.
There is a small amount available w/o re-indexing if you have the 
2-piece adjustable
spring plates.
Due to the labor involved, I'd recommend also going to bigger bars at 
the same time.
My car is used for autox/track/street and it measures 24" all-around at 
the fenders with
205/60R15 tires i.e. 24.7" OD w/o any rubbing problems though I have a 
lot of negative
camber.  You also need to install rack spacers in front to correct bump steer.

I just had my car at Pocono with the new set-up and the handling was 
transformed.
