John,

What I have discovered, after much troubleshooting was a problem within
Outlook Express.  For some unknown reason one of my mailboxes replicated
itself as a sub folder of another, unrelated, mailbox.  I guess the Inbox
assistant was having trouble deciding how to filter the inbound email.  My
filters still pointed to the original mailbox but only the first 7 messages
got transferred and then the email download would just stop.  It looked
like OE was using up so much processor time that the entire system slowed
to a crawl but OE never would resume the download, thereby never getting to
the point that it would delete the mail from the server.  Hence the smae
email downloading over and over.

I transferred all the mail that ended up in the mystery mailbox, which
contained all my "missing mail" to the original mailbox and deleted the
duplicate.  All is fine now.  Pretty weird, huh?

I  don't know if the problem began with some out of control clicking on my
part or something that OE did to itself but at least I found the problem
and was able to fix it.

Thanks for the info.  OBTW. my drives are both working fine in 32 bit mode,
not in compatibility mode.

Al
