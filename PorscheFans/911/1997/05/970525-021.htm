Without question! I was going on the premise that Gary was talking about
the infinity/lexus/acura type of car.

I don't know about the NSX, I've heard it's geared poorly for lower
speed types of driving. But the RX-7 would give a 993 a serious run for
the money. A 914 would be eaten alive and whole by the 3rd gen RX-7.
