Joe,

I would recommend against the Syntec 5W-50 because to get that kind of viscosity
range, even with a synthetic oil, you have to add viscosity extenders, which break
down over time but particularly under high rev/load/heat conditions. I don't believe
the Mobil 1 oils use any viscosity extenders, but I could be wrong on this.
Viscosity extenders don't lubricate, either, so any added decreases the lubricity of
the oil.

As for differences in pressure readings - at startup oil pressures with a synthetic
may read lower than with a dino oil because flow rate is higher (though this depends
on the 'W' number of both oils). This is a good thing at startup. Once hot,
pressures should be about the same for oils of the same viscosity. Higher
viscosities will yield higher oil pressures and lower total oil flow rates.

Your ideal is to use the lowest viscosity that will still prevent any metal/metal
contact in the engine under any conditions it is likely to encounter. Lower
viscosity will give higher oil flow, decreased internal friction, decreased engine
wear, and improved engine cooling. As long as viscosity is still high enough to
prevent metal/metal contact.
