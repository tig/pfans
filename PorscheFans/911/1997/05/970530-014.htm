Oy! You're living my nightmare. I assume you're using a high-temp fluid and
bleeding the brakes before the event, and flushing and bleeding after. When
you're braking down from 140mph many times a day I think brake fluid is
going to be considered a consumable.

The stock brakes on the C2/C4 are IMHO barely up to handling hard track if
you are very conscientious about temperature management. If you go in hot
and brake late in the zone you can build up a lot of heat.  I put the C2
Turbo brake kit on my C4, and cooling ducts as well for an increased margin
of safety. Even so, with the big reds, I can feel my brakes beginning to
soften during the course of a track day. I feel it as increased pedal
travel until the brakes bite, and as an increasing sponginess in the pedal
feel.

I can understand why you'd want to be cautious! But if you pit without cool
down and test your pedal don't create more trouble by putting the hot
rotors and pads together and cooking the fluid some more. Similarly, don't
"warm up" your brakes while they're cooling down on the straight from the
last turn ;-) I'm sure you know that you have to manage letting the heat
you put into the brakes radiate away.  It's a dance, moderating brake use
carefully in the braking zone to avoid intense heat build-up, and using as
much of time to the next turn to let the brakes cool off. You might
consider adding the cool brake scoops to the stock setup you have.

Anyway, glad you're OK. Could always have been a lot worse.
