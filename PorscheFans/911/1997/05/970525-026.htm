Ah, see my concept of twisties are 35-50 mph roads. Mulholland is a
little too open to fit my definition of twisties, more like sweepers.
Tight moutain canyon roads are my favorite. Give me a road like an autox
course and I'm happy.

Now this is getting to a topic that is running on teh national autox
list. And that is, should factory tuner-special edition cars really be
considered "stock". Examples: BMW M3, RX-7 I & R1 & R2 models, Neon ACR,
Miata R, Camaro SS, and oh yeah, M030 equiped P-cars to name but a few.
