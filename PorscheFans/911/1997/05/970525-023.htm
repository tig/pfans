     On 5/25/97, responding to some comments I made regarding Japanese 
     sports cars, Josh Hadler wrote:

I don't know about the NSX, I've heard it's geared poorly for lower 
speed types of driving. But the RX-7 would give a 993 a serious run for 
the money. A 914 would be eaten alive and whole by the 3rd gen RX-7.
     ___________________________________________________________
     Because of the NSX's high top speed (170 mph) and only 5 forward gears, the
gearing might be considered tall.  For example, in 2nd gear, it's 10 mph per 
1000 rpms, meaning that you're doing 80 mph at the 8000 rpm redline before 
shifting to 3rd.  In 3rd, it's 14 mph per 1000 rpms, meaning you're doing 112 
mph before shifting to 4th.  But, this gearing would not hurt you at all in the 
twisties.  Even if they were tight (like, say Mulholland Drive here in L.A.), 
you'd be doing anywhere between 50 to 70 mph through them, which would put you 
at 5000 to 7000 rpms in 2nd gear, right in the meat of the powerband.  On a 
little more open twisties, like the Angeles Crest and Angeles Forest Highways, 
speed would be between 70 and 80 through most of it (other than some super fast 
sweepers on the Forest!), which would be between 5000 and 6000 rpms in 3rd gear,
again in the fat part of the powerband.  Sorry, I digress, but you can tell I 
love these cars, these roads and driving on them!

     Anyway, although it's not going to make a lot of 993 owners real happy with
me, I have to say honestly that both the NSX and 3rd gen RX-7 would have the 
advantage over a stock 993, both in the twisties and on the race track.  
Although 993's are the best handling 911's ever made, they still need some work 
to balance them out and corner flatter, in order to keep up with a stock NSX or 
3rd gen RX-7 with the R1 package.  For example, I have turned 1:36 around Willow
Springs with both a bone stock NSX and 3rd gen RX-7 R1 (they do it a bit 
differently, but the ultimate result is surprisingly similar), and I don't 
believe a stock 993 could equal that performance.  In fact, I think a stock 993 
would be lucky to turn a 1:38 around Willow, but if anyone has any figures 
(remember, we're talking stock!), please let us know.

     I'd like to end this post by saying, before anyone comes back suggesting 
that I should go back to my Japanese cars, that I sold my RX-7 to buy my present
'90 C2 Cab (I'm quite happy, thank you, even if I had to do some suspension work
to it to enable it to keep up with my old 3rd gen RX-7 when it was stock), and I
learned to race with an '85 911 Carrera Targa.  I love Porsches, for a variety 
of reasons, but I believe that one must be objective and give credit where 
credit is due.

     P.S. - It just occurred to me that Andy Warren owns an NSX as well as a 
Porsche - I just can't remember which Porsche he has and what his driving 
experience is.  As usual, we'd love to hear Andy's opinion if he has one on this
subject.
