Help!  I've got my 2.4 sitting on furniture dolly in the middle of
the garage right now.  I'm trying to remove the heat exchangers
and am have some difficulty.  First, in being able to reach all of
the nuts.  Second, in that the engine is sitting on the exhangers!

Is it safe to hold up the engine with some blocks of wood under the
cylinders; where/what is a safe place to support the engine so I
can pull the exhaust off?  Also, is there some recommended procedure
to loosening the nuts.  Several came off pretty easily (though I
had to use a weird combo of socket, u-joints, and extensions), some
resulted in the stud backing out, and others are plain stuck.  Well,
I don't know that they are stuck; I just didn't use a lot of force
for fear of breaking a stud.  I had thought of using a propane torch,
but ruled that out since I figure the nut would cool off by the time
I finagled the socket in place.  Also, the dolly is pretty flamable.
Can anyone provide me with some hints/suggestions on this procedure?

Thanks,
Mike
