I don't think the braided wires do anything for you except make your
wallet lighter.  I believe they were originally supposed to be one of the
"fixes" to keep air boxes from blowing, but the wires weren't the cause
in the first place.

I would suggest that you buy a set of the "un-braided" factory wires (the
ones usually advertised for the early models).  I bought mine from Zims
for about $80.  They work just fine.

Good luck,
