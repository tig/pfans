I can help w/ #2.  I have a '72 and made this mod.  I started by going
to a friendly dealer and getting them to make me a copy of the oil
cooling diagram for a '72S.  As you noted, the factory lines are very
expensive -- if you can find them; so I used Air-O-Quip braided SS lines
in AN-12 size.  The oil console must be machined to be able to accept
the oil thermostat you will be putting in.  I took mine over to Lukes &
Shoreman in Berkeley, CA back in '89 and they charged me $25 or so to do
the simple boring out of the port in the oil console where the thermo
goes.  On the back side of the console you will find a steel plug -- you
need to remove this and connect the line going to your front cooler -- I
had to have a part made up that went from metric to AN-12.  As I recall,
I had a machinist use the original plug, cutting off the hex end and
welding on an AN-12 steel male threaded piece.  I also used an early RX7
oil cooler -- found a good used one at a wrecking yard (be sure to look
it over for signs of leakage and that it didn't come from a car with an
exploded engine; solvent clean and pressure test it before proceeding as
well) -- I had the cooler modified by removing the internal bypass
thermostat (probably wouldn't bother with this in doing it again, as it
operates at similar specs to the Porsche thermo and helps protect the
cooler from a shock of cold thick oil) and had AN-12 male fittings
welded to the in/out of the cooler.  You will need to cut a small
section at the front of your trunk pan so that the cooler is recessed
properly for the RSR spoiler, and have a body shop make up a sheet metal
back for this cut out area.  The cooler mounts I fabricated myself.  I
ran the oil lines in the approximate factory location and used insulated
brackets (looks like a pipe support) with self tapping sheet metal
screws to hold the lines in place.  I bought the AN fittings, lines,
brackets, etc. from Pegasus Racing.  One last thing: I bought a used oil
console from Easy so that I could continue running the car until I had
all the pieces ready to go.  The installation took me the better part of
a day.  Oil temps with a 2.4E motor on the track -- no matter the
outside air temp., never exceeded 195 deg F!!

Good luck to you....
