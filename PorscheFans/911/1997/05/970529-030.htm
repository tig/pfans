I have a '78 Euro Targa that, apparently, did not originally have fog lights.  There is no relay present or wiring to the fuse.  But, the car DOES have a fog light switch (between rear window defog and lighter on dash).  I am currently installing an updated, U.S. front valance with fog lights.  Question is, does anyone know where the wires from the dash-mounted switch, if they exist, would physically run or do I have to remove ductwork, etc. to get to the switch location itself?

A bit of trivia: Does anyone know why 911 wipers come to rest on the drivers side when turned off?  This is the opposite of virtually every other wiper and usually results in an annoying streak on the driver's side caused by the passenger-side wiper when they are turned off or during intermittent mode.

Finally, are back issues of Panorama worth anything?  My bookshelf is filling up and I am getting ready to pitch some old issues ('89-'94).
