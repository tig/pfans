To remove the heat exchanger (my car had the SSI ones, so I hope this works for you) I purchased a 13mm "distributor" wrench
from Snap-On.  It is the long handled 90 degree wrench.  I still
had to bend the wrench a little bit to get it to clear under the 
heat exchangers.  If you plan to disassemble the entire motor
you should get a standard American engine stand that has the 
swivel bracket to mount to the engine.  Then purchase the 911
half circle bracket to mount to the engine.  This allows you to
rotate the engine and get to all the parts easly.  You may be
able to purchase one of these used, by checking PANO, and Excellence, sometimes this part shows up in the classifieds.

Subject:	Removing heat exchangers?

Help!  I've got my 2.4 sitting on furniture dolly in the middle of
the garage right now.  I'm trying to remove the heat exchangers
and am have some difficulty.  First, in being able to reach all of
the nuts.  Second, in that the engine is sitting on the exhangers!

Is it safe to hold up the engine with some blocks of wood under the
cylinders; where/what is a safe place to support the engine so I
can pull the exhaust off?  Also, is there some recommended procedure
to loosening the nuts.  Several came off pretty easily (though I
had to use a weird combo of socket, u-joints, and extensions), some
resulted in the stud backing out, and others are plain stuck.  Well,
I don't know that they are stuck; I just didn't use a lot of force
for fear of breaking a stud.  I had thought of using a propane torch,
but ruled that out since I figure the nut would cool off by the time
I finagled the socket in place.  Also, the dolly is pretty flamable.
Can anyone provide me with some hints/suggestions on this procedure?

Thanks,
Mike
