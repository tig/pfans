All right, I wouldn't trouble you all with such a seemingly trivial
problem, but I am hoping that a flash of wisdom from one of you will cure
me of a four legged problem.
I have but one car: an 86 Targa.  Additionally, I have but one girl friend:
a 69 blond.  The problem is the girl  friend's cat.  No, it's not coming
between us, but it does insist on checking out my car every time that I
pay her a visit.  It habitually jumps on the hood, makes a tour of the
entire windshield and roof, before going down the across the engine cover
and jumping to the ground.
The problem is that I appear obsessive--leaping up from candle-lit dinners
to go and rescue the car from the cat, etc..  I suggest that we stroll
about outside only so I can circle the car and "affectionately" pick up
and stroke the cat whenever it gets too close to the car.
I don't mind cleaning the car and removing paw prints, but I found a
scratch the other day that, albeit minor, seemed like it was
caused by the cat.  Do any of you know of the effects of cats on P-cars?

Does anybody have suggestions on how to solve this problem?  No, she
refuses to have the cat declawed.  She is also not amenable to taking the
cat to a shelter.
A cover seems like it might only make things worse if the cat started to
slide, but I don't know.
Any ideas short of "marking" my territory?

Thanks a lot.
Tom 
Black '86 Targa
