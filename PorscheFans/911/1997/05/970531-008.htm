As it turns out the engine I am considering purchasing is a 2.4 T with
mechanical injection. I have been told that the 2.4 T engine is a very
reliable engine. My 2.4 S engine needs repair and I am looking to replace
it with the T engine while it is being overhauled. I am also considering
buying a 67 911 coupe with no engine. When the S engine is ready to go
again, I would then use the T engine in the 67 coupe. Would those of you
with 2.4T mechanically injected engines let me know your opinion of the
engine. How reliable are they? Are they are tremendously under powered
engine? And does anybody know the going rate for a good used 2.4T engine. I
think Im getting a pretty decent deal. All of the responses to my previous
postings have been great.

Thanks again,

Terry Merrell
