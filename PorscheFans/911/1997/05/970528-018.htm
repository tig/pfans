One man's opinion follows...

I'm less qualified than others to  pass judgement on the '77 you're
looking at, so I won't (others will, I'm sure). I'm somewhat qualified in
the "getting tired of looking" area, as I've been looking for about
5 months for an 87-89 Carrera coupe.

For me, it comes down to "what do I want" versus "what will I settle for".
I've never been one to "settle", if I can afford not to. I'm tired of
looking too, but I KNOW that if I jump on something and the 'right' car
comes by a month later, I'll kick myself - you probably will too. 

If you have been "holding out" for an SC, I would assume you had reasons
to chose an SC in the first place over one of the 2.7 cars. If you bought
this particular car, would those reasons come back to haunt you?

From your brief description, the '77 sounds like it's probably a nice
car, IF the rebuild was done right. But is it what you want?
