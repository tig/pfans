     We're certainly flattered, but I must say, you seem to be in the 
     minority, compared with the Canadians I've met.  However, you're on 
     the Pfans list, so how bad could you be?  We'll take you!  Tell the 
     INS that Pfans sent you!

Todd:
You really want a guy who would renounce his country for a speeding 
ticket? Into the breach, dear fellow... You can have him! 

Joe:
Tell us it ain't so...Joe. You just forgot to put that funky l'il Happy 
Face thingy after your comment. Right? Oh, you just remembered it wasn't 
Canada, it was Iran, or was that Bosnia you were thinking of?!.
Reality check... We're talking about Radar Detectors!

Last time I checked, we all have the right to fight for our rights 
without the fear someone is going to kill our famililies. 

Stranger than fiction.
