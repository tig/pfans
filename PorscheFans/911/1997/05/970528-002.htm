Thanks to all of you who responded to my cat-scratch-on-car problem.  Many
of the responses were potentially useful and hilarious.  I plan to resolve
the problem by creating an amalgam of the suggestions.  Although the idea
of using a mildly charged electric pad on the trunk sounds very effective,
I can tell you that my girl friend would never tolerate the solution.

Instead, I plan to use a thick cover that fits tightly over the car which
I will first  thoroughly rub with moth balls (one of the first and
particularly intriguing suggestions that I received).  If this doesn't
work, I'll park the car off the cat's territory-- it's very rural terrain
and I could leave it on a country road, say a tenth of a mile from her
house.  
Thanks a million for the ideas.
