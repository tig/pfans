Hello Pfans:
        I just developed a problem with my brake warning light on my 
84 Carrera...

We had a track event this weekend, and after a run group, I noticed that 
the brake warning light was on. I checked the fluid reservoir and did not
see any problems. I don't recall seeing the light before my run group, but
it was my first run of the day and I was running late...

I figured, that I had messed up the emergency brake warning switch since
I had installed a short shifter a few days ago. On Sunday, the brake pad
warning light came on sometime during the day. I have the brake sensors
disconnected. So now both lights are on. Belt warning light acts correctly.

After taking my parking brake lever apart, I noticed I had crushed a wire and
was grounding the idiot light. After taping the chafed wire I'm still getting
the pad and emergency brake lights on.  I bled the F + R systems and the light
still remains on. I disconnected the battery thinking it might reset itself
but it did not. Checked all the pad sensors and they are ok.

Does anyone know if this things fail in that mode? I looked at the wiring
diagram and there is some kind of logic circuit. I disconnected the battery for
a short time. Will a longer period reset the module?  Is the module right 
behind the warning light?

Thanks for your help!
