Todd, et al,

Don't most, if not all, states regard driving as a privilege rather than
a right? I assume this is because roads are built and owned by
government agencies and there is nothing in the Constitution granting us
rights specific to driving on public roads. Hence the government
agencies can stipulate the conditions under which licenses to drive will
be issued.

BTW, I am not an attorney, I just play one in my fantasies!
