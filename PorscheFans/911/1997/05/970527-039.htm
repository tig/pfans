Joe -

If you don't go to the pressure-fed tensioners, it's absolutely mandatory that the 
swivel arms be of the type introduced in '80, I think it was.

As Bruce Anderson points out in his excellent book, the factory learned that tensioner 
failures in early 911s were due not so much to failure of the hydraulic cylinder, as 
everyone assumed, but to galling and binding of the pivots of the swing arms.  That 
happens because there is a vector twisting force on the pivots due to the fact that the 
load is not in exactly the same plane as the support.

The newer swing arms use wider pivot bases to eliminate the twisting force on the 
pivots.  New cylinders are also necessary because the mounting base of the cylinders had 
to be made narrower in order to allow room for the wider pivot bases on the swing arms.

When updating to the improved arms in a '69 engine, although the arms hadn't bound up, I 
found significant galling on the pivot posts - they were on their way.  In my opinion it 
is sufficient to carefully remove the "lumps" of galling which are above surface level 
by use of abrasive stone.  Obviously, great care must be taken to prevent the residue 
from getting into the engine.  The pitting component of the galling, below surface 
level, will not hurt anything and the galling should not re-appear with the newer, 
wider-based arms.

That's my nickel's worth - anyone else?
