Joe,

I don't think that any 911 that is running street tires needs a strut bar.

If you are running slicks or DOT racing rubber (e.g. BFG R1s) you might
need them on pre-964 cars. It depends on the size of tire and forces
generated. 

If you have coilovers on the front and are using some type of racing
rubber, I would say a strut bar is a good idea. 

It all has to do with where and how much stress you are putting on the
unibody. A 911 with torsion bars do not put all that much stress on the
shock towers. If you have wide sticky tires the potential is there to
generate a lot of force which could cause the shock towers to move enough
to be detrimental.

Strut bars don't cost all that much and they certainly can't hurt.
