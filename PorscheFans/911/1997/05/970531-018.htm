Replying to Bruce's query about head room with a helmet also gives me a
chance to report on last weekend's Bogus Basin Bacchanalia.

In preparing to participate in the BBB (see below), I discovered that head
room is a problem for me.  I'm 6'3" and my '73 T has aftermarket Recaros.
I've never competed in PCA events until now, and I was told that headroom
might be a problem.  Sure enough, when I got a helmet I discovered I had to
adjust the seatback some to let me sit fairly comfortably.  Strangely
enough, once I got into the event, I never noticed a problem with head room.
It was only sitting in line waiting my turn that I was bothered by it.  It
hasn't seemed to have done my headliner any damage.  I was told by others
that one good cure is racing belts.  They cinch you down so well in the seat
that headroom problems are greatly diminished.

OK, now to the event.  I should say ahead of time that I just recently
retired from a Navy civil service job in San Diego and moved back to my
original home town, Boise, Idaho.  When I got here I wanted to make contact
with the local PCAers, who are in the Silver Sage Region.  It turns out that
shortly after I arrived they were putting on their big event of the year,
the Bogus Basin Bacchanalia.  (Bogus Basin is a ski resort 20 miles n. of
Boise.)  They've been doing this for something like 17 years.  It's a
weekend with a hillclimb (actually, a hillcross because one of the
switchback legs on the hill has some cones placed strategically -- something
to do with official PCA sanction, I think), a rally, and a "mystery event."

Since I've never competed formally, this was going to be my "debut."  I was
a little anxious, but the folks here couldn't have been nicer or more
helpful.  We'd had great weather for several weeks, but the evening before
the hillcross the fog and rain descended on the hill so nobody knew what to
expect.  The hill is a mile above Boise, so the weather can be quite
different.  We had a driver's meeting that night on the hill, and most of us
participated in the "mystery event" which consisted of two-person teams, one
guiding the blindfolded other through a series of events (ring toss, beanbag
toss, pin the tail on the carerra, etc.  Nothing heavy, but fun.

I went back up the hill the next morning and found the fog about the same,
but no rain.  It lifted enough so we could begin the runs.  I was in the
second of three groups, so I got to worry about how I'd do while watching
the first group finish in relatively cold conditions.  When my group came,
the weather improved quite a bit, and we all got our runs in in somewhat
warmer weather.  I don't know exactly how I did because I left early (see
below), but I seemed to be posting times comparable to other cars I
considered similar to mine, and I improved a bit after each run.  Most
importantly, I didn't lose a fender or a leg.
I went down to work one of the corners for the last group.  About halfway
through their runs (and approaching 5 PM or so), the fog came back, it
started raining, and then we had about half an hour of hail, enough so that
we could have made hailballs.  The rest of the event was cancelled, and I
headed home in the inclement weather.  Those who stayed up at the resort
overnight came down for the rally the next morning with six inches of snow
on their cars.

The rally was turned into a tour because it was raining hard down in the
valley, and nobody wanted to sit in the rain at the checkpoints all day.  We
ended up at a mountain resort 60 miles north of Boise for a lunch which was
excellent.
(Less rainy there, too.)

Although the events didn't go off as planned, it was a well-run event, and
the people were excellent throughout.  If you have a chance, come out for it
next year.  It's always on the Memorial Day Weekend, and we had several
participants from Portland, Seattle, and Salt Lake City, as well as others.

Sorry to put you through all of this, Bruce.
