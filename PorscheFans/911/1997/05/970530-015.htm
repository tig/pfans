The fault, as I saw it, concerned the referenced lights coming on
intermittently. In my case it was as simple as filling the brake fluid
reservoir all the way to max.

I have had my ABS pump fail completely once, and when it went I lost all
pressure in the system once the accumulator had been drained.  The pedal
was then completely unassisted and harder to depress than I was used to.
You can tell if the ABS pump is functioning by (1) listening for the pump
building pressure when you first turn the key to ignition on, before
starting the engine in the morning; (this assumes that pressure has leaked
down overnight), or (2) forcing the pump to cycle by pumping the brake
pedal lightly for 5-20 times using up what's in the accumulator. The pump
should start to run, and be audible in the driver's seat, or certainly from
under the front deck.

I'm not an expert, and I bet the Hammer understands a 911 better than I do.
The ABS system is pretty comlicated and probabyl has loads of failure
modes. But adding some fluid seems like an easy thing to test.
