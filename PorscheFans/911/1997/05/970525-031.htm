Charles,
  The '78 on SC's might be a good starting point, they have the reliable
3.0l engine, oil cooler lines, and wider rear flares for easier ability to
install > 205 width tires.

So unless you have a real fondness for the early ones, I'd consider an '78
SC or later 911.

If you do go for a mid '70s 911, the '77 which I have has some special
features, over pre '77 911's such as full body galvanization, bronze valve
guides, dilivar head studs, brake assist, but still notorious 2.7l magnesium
engine, (I now have a 3.0l SC engine), and the '77 still has the narrow
wheel wells of the early style 911s.
