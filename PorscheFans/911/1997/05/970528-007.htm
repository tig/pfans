I've recent acquired an '88 911 coupe, great condition, I'm thrilled.  It
came with a sunroof and without sport seats.  I am 6 feet tall and
proportioned such that I can't sit in a proper driving position with a
helmet on.  I expected this and have budgeted for seats.  I borrowed
(temporarily) a Porsche sport seat and it is much better but I'd like a bit
more.  Even with the sport seat the compromise position has my arms a bit
too extended.   (I'm just glad my helmet is a Simpson; Bell helmets are
taller and the problem would be worse!)

I'm told a Recaro track seat with normal rails is not any better than the
sport seat, maybe worse.  But, if I get the racing rail set-up for the
Recaro it'll get me down abit further than the Porsche sport seat.  Can
anyone give me feedback on this?

Also, has anyone else gone through this with any other after-market seat
solution?  Sparco?  Corbeau?  

Maybe if I hadn't stood up straight when mother told me to I'd be bent now
and would fit the car!!!
