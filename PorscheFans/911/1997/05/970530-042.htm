Hello group,

I just recently subscribed to this list-serve as a means of obtaining info 
to facilitate some investigative due diligence before my first Porsche 
purchase.  I do not plan on purchasing my first Porsche for another 8 to 9 
months, but I was wondering what kind of value the group places on a few of 
the later year models and options.  I am looking and limiting myself to a 
vehicle between the $45K and $50K range with relatively low mileage (Under 
20,000).  I have not done a great deal of exhaustive research yet, but I 
have begun by focusing on 911 coupes (I don't care for Targas or 
Cabriolets) between 1991 and 1995. There appears to be a great deal of 
flexibility of options concerning specific models (C-2, C-4, RSA, etc...) 
and I was wondering what current Porsche owners and weekend racers would 
recommend.  How much more of a benefit or hindrance is the all-wheel-drive 
feature of the C-4 model? Is a 6-speed, 5-speed, or 4-speed tiptronic 
recommended? Should I place more emphasis on 911 coupes between 94' and 95' 
even though I would possibly sacrifice improvements added by the C-4 or 
turbocharged models due to my budget?
My preference is lightweight, with the largest liter size engine (if it 
varies between 91' and 95'), and a car in which I can gradually add 
after-market enhancements and racing-like features.  I would want the 
vehicle to serve the purpose of occasional (Sunday) weekend enjoyment and I 
plan on not putting over 3,000-4,000 miles a year on the car.  I would also 
like for this vehicle to serve this purpose for at least 12-15 years.  I do 
not want a turbo (Due to the immediate added insurance premiums encompassed 
with my current age of 24), but I would like to eventually add 
turbocharger(s). Also could someone comment on this whole 993 thing?  What 
is Porsche's objective and why does it exist?
All of your comments would be greatly appreciated by this "Newbie."
Thanks a million!
Mack C. Norris

p.s. The Porsche 911 documentary on the History Channel was wonderful...I 
plan on taping it when it comes on again at 2 a.m. 5/31/97
