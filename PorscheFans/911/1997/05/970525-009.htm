adding to list of war stories...
i "ignored" a summons from the state of WI for trying to achieve lift-off in
a rental car, based on my home state DMV's statement the there was no
"receprocity" between NJ and WI.  Well, I have now learned this only means
that the points don't follow you, but the payment (or lack thereof) will
follow you like the IRS.  So my non-payment came back to haunt me, as WI
suspended my priv. to drive in america's dairyland, therefore NJ figured if i
am that nasty that the nice folks in WI want to cancel me, then they ought to
follow suit.  So NJ caught up to me 12+ months later, and gave me 10 days to
pay the WI fine, or see my NJ license become revoked.  I had to fed-x checks
to WI, plus a $50 hit for re-instating my priv to drive in WI, (travel a lot
for work), and of couse pay some bucks to NJ for their efforts to enforce
justice.  

The fatal catch was that I told NJ i wanted to protest the suspension, since
i was certain i would never get the necessary paperwork from WI within 10
days, and suspension would be inevitable.  Well. all you WI residents out
there, you have a great DMV, they are nice guys, and they quickly faxed the
stuff to NJ DMV.  However, even though they got the all-clear from WI, NJ DMV
saw me as a no-show for the hearing, and suspended me anyway.  I spoke with
the same semi-person every day for a week, each time she insisted she had
never spoken to me before.  Finally they backed off.

Moral-  pay the ticket.  the feds have paid ibm or someone a lot of $$ for
the mother of all computers to track us scofflaws.
