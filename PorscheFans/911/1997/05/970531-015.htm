I recently ordered a Weltmeister chip from Automotion for my '86 Targa.
Your '84 should take the same.  They are having a sale that is not
published in anything that I have received (I think that the cost was
$229 or $249).  Well I noted in the instructions that were included with
the chip that Automotion or associates will do installation on any
previous chip that is soldered in.  It's a matter of sending them the
computer and waiting a few days.

I don't have their phone number handy, but its "Automotion" in Sunnyvale,
CA. I think that they have an 800 number as well.  You might consider
calling them for details. 

Tom
