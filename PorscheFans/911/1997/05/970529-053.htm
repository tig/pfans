I've been reading a lot of stuff on PorscheFans about window
lubrication.  Recently, I removed the regulator from the driver's side
door of my '70 911T Coupe.  The crank was slipping and the window didn't
move.  I ended up replacing the aluminum pin on the regulator with a
metal one.  I also greased all joints, including the tracks at the base
of the window.  I put everything back together and all was good, the
window worked again...UNTIL the next morning when the car was cold (I
use the term loosely, considering I live in the LA area)  The window
would not go down.  Later in the day, when the car was warm, the window
worked again.  This situation persists.

Should I have used a lighter lubricant, and is it OK to grease the
tracks at the base of the window?  I'd love to hear your comments before
I rip the door apart again.

Also, is it really impossible to replace the interior door pockets for
under $400 each!  Just curious.

Thanks for your comments!
