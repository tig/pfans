Message to Al whose E-mail was incorrect (<personll@ix.net.com

Dear Al,

I drove my 911 for some years, including track time, before getting the 930.
Don't even think about a turbo until you have learned to drive a normally
spirated 911 on the track.  The car is definitely dangerous and I still get
sidewise on the street, especially in the rain and snow.  I have just
replaced the oil feed line to the turbo so the engine are in two separate
places in my garage.  Valve adjustment is next.  From now on I will just
drop the engine for the valves, etc. taking about 2-3 hours to do so.  I can
do the valves in my 911 in 2 hours total but the turbo is a 10hr labor
charge and I can see why.  Working on it is almost frightening.  I don't
find any porsche particularly maintenance-intensive but I come from Lotus
elans and Jaguars which are basically pieces of shit.  

No trouble with the turbo so far and plan to go with a non-stock one next
with a bigger intercooler.  Once you own a turbo, the power becomes
addicting and there is NEVER enough.  Boost come on about 3800 and you
better be paying attention at that point.  I use this to my advantage on the
track however.

Marc James is advertising on 911@porschefans.com a very nice 1985 Ruf turbo
and I would buy it for $30K is didn't already have one.  Also, if you plan
to get one despite bypassing a normal 911, get the latest one you can
afford.  Every year Porsche makes a better car--the latest twin turbo is
probably the best car in the world.

Good luck and don't delay buying a Porsche--and take it to the
track--driver's ed is a real bargin.

Lynn
