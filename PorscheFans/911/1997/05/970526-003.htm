=================

I had a narrow-body C2 with 17" wheels, and now have a wide-body C2 with 18s.

My  recommendation is that if you are just driving around town, stick with
the 17s. There is a trade-off, IMHO, with the 18s that pays off in corners,
but penalizes you the rest of the time. The 18s are more sensitive to minor
surface irregularites.

Disclaimer: the above observations were made with lower and uprated springs
on both cars.

My car is a pleasure driver, and I would consider going back to 17s without
hesitation, if I found (or wanted to pay for) the right combination of
looks and offset (Kinesis, Fikse, etc.).

To use the Factory 17" wheels on a wide body car requires a 31mm spacer
adapter for the rears... I have a pair if you are interested.
