     Hi all,
 
     I test drove a 1994 3.6 Turbo last week.  WOW !!!  I could not believe
     how quick it was (much, much quicker than the 3.3 turbos I have
     driven).  During the test drive I nailed the throtle at about 3000 RPMs
     without any turbo lag the salesman and I were launched into the next
     block.  It produced such high g forces that when I let go of the gas
     (without braking), we lunged forward to the point where the seat belt
     retractors engaged.
>>>

The 96/97 993 Turbos are quicker yet!!! 

>>>>
     These cars were $110,000 new in 1994.  I have seen several for sale in
     the mid to upper $60s with 7 or 8,000 miles.  This car does the 1/4
     mile in the same time as the 993 Twin Turbo.
 >>>

Not exactly the 993 has 400 horsepower where the 94/95 turbos had I think
355?  The 94/95's were like 12.5 to 12.7 in the quarter whereas the 993 Turbo
is 12.1 to 12.5 depending on who tests the car.  Either way they are both
very
fast cars!!!!

>>>>
     My question to the group is ....what is wrong with this picture?  Have
     there been problems with this car.  How could it have depreciated so
     quickly?  It seems like the performance deal of the century.  Please
     respond with comments or know problems with this car.  I want to buy
     one soon!!!! (3.6 turbo owners please tell me your experiences).
