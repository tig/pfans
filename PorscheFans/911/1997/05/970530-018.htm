hi Pfans   did someone own 911 around 80'-84' (coupe)??? since i am consider
buying them, i should prepare for some problem that might happen after i got
it???  what about their options? somethings different from 78'SC?  they got
3.2 or 3.0 engine?
would someone (ownone or not) please give me an advice on this?

and other thing is yesterday i called some insurance company for a price of
88'cope and my price for full coverage is 3,300/6month???????? and for
reliability is 1,300/6month??????? (i am 18 years old with no records) does
some one around my age have this problem (have money for buying a car but
not enough for insurance)  i wonder if they might have some GOOD & NICE
insurance company around WA (i am in tacoma, university place)

thanks a lot and take care,
Jap
