I have tried unsucessfully for the past week to get parts shipped by
Ron at EuroSpeed.

I called Thursday last week and placed a $1000+ order of misc parts.
Prices were on a par with Vertex, but he claimed to have everyting in
stock.  I told him it was important that stuff ship promptly since I had 2 sets of heads at the machine shop and I needed the valves and gasket sets ASAP.

When I called tuesday (twice) I got the answering service,

About 6:30pm Ron called back.  He hadn't shipped the parts yet but said
he'd ship Wednesday. He siad he could ship them overnight at my
expense.  When I mentioned he promised to ship last week, he said he'd
been away.

Wednesday I called twice, left messages to make sure the parts
shipped.  No response.

Today I called again, message service only, and canceled the order.

Sounds like EuroProducts "Oh Yeah, we have that stuff in stock and
we'll ship today"

BTW: They also do not read the sprynet.com emails sent to them.

This apparently is not ususual with them.  Sam thing happened to
another region member.

If you have had good experience, that's fine.  The fact that this can
happen, even occasionally, is enought for them to lose all future
business from me.

Now the parts are coming from Vertex.  They can hit me by tomorrow
without additional charges.

FYI,
	Steve
