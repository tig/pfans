<<Does anybody have suggestions on how to solve this problem?  No, she

refuses to have the cat de-clawed.  She is also not amenable to taking the

cat to a shelter.  A cover seems like it might only make things worse if the
cat started to

slide, but I don't know.  Any ideas short of "marking" my territory?>>

Now don't anyone go about saying that Brian Buxton doesn't like cats, but I'd
say an easy solution to your problem is to take the cat for a drive.  He/she
seems to like your Porsche so much that it would be the right thing to do.
 Take Puss out to the park and show it how much fun it is to climb trees.
 Then at the right moment, when Puss is enamored with the fresh air and
squirrels, slowly sneak away.  Tell your girlfriend that you haven't seen the
cat in a while and wonder what happened to it, then buy her a nice de-clawed
Persian that never goes outside to help her get over her grief.  Just a
thought.  Or you could go buy one of those pads that you lay on the hood of
your car that shocks *ever so mildly* the cat when it jumps up.  However,
this may lead to even more scratches, or worse yet the result of *startling*
the cat (liquid or solid) on your hood.
Anyone else have any ideas?  Does your girlfriend know how much this bothers
you?
