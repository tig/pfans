FWIW, when I do any tinkering with the motor in my stock 2.2L 1971 911S
I'll drag race (20-120mph) a friend of mine's 1978 911SC and judge my
mechanical success as to how far ahead of him I stay during the run.  He
has more horsepower (and his exhaust, cams, etc. have been tweaked) but
the low weight of the 911S's seem to provide an exceptional power to
weight ratio.  If I remember right there was a large weight increase in
1972 and slight increases nearly every year thereafter, so you might
want to check some charts to find out whether this relationship is still
valid for the 1977 911S.

PS.  He's still a better driver and kills me on autocrosses and time
trials.

Subject: WHAT TO DO ?

Hello again P-fans.

I'm seriously looking at a 77 911s, with a rebuild @ 50,000 & chain
tensioners updated at the same time,also has a new clutch & new tires.
Seems
to be pretty cherry. Oh yeah has 67,000 miles as of right now.What do
guys
think? I think i can buy it for maybe $10,000 or do I hold out for a 78
SC
with 3.0. Man do I need some porsche advise today. Also has non factory
a/c.
What do you think about that? I guess I'm getting tired of looking &
almost
ready to take my chances. Who knows.

Thanks,

Rob Jones
