Bruce,

I'm 6' 3" and understand the issue.  The sunroof takes a lot more
of the interior headroom than many people realize.

I have sportseats in my '86 cab, re-mounted about 1" to the
rear.  For cruising (rather than autocross) the seat sits all
the way to the rear, with the front of the seat as high as
adjustable and the rear of the seat as low as adjustable.
Additional items were an extended steering wheel (should
be available for your car) and extending the gearshift and
tilting it back slightly.  These two changes put everything
more at hand.

Not sure you won't have to find heroic ways to lower the
seat even more if you're going to be comfortable with a
helmet on in a sunroof coupe.
