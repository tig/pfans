....I have a mechanic, whose judgment I trust, that installed a 3.0 in my 77
911S about a year ago. At that time I had him inspect "everything" in the new
engine that was accessible and suggest any repairs or replacements that he
thought feasible. One of the items that he did not recommend was upgrading
the tensioners (which I was prepared to do). He likes tensioners with guards
(which I have), as he has seen two of the pressure-fed tensioners fail and
does not like that they do not accomodate guards. My engine runs
flawlessly...but, like any enthusiast, I read all the books, magazines, and
PorscheFans archives that are constantly telling me to make the change. Is
there anyone out there that can see his point? I don't want to hurt his
feelings by insisting that we change...but I also don't want to walk home
from 100 miles away.
