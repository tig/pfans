Henry Watts and Scott Cragin ( and maybe some others, who knows?) are puzzled
about why 911 wiper blades park where they do.  Pardon me while I pull on my
long grey beard, speaking euphemistically. The early 911/912 wipers parked on
the passenger side and I cannot remember when the change was made to the
driver's side but there was a simple reason. And, it had nothing to do with
clearing the driver's side faster.
When the blades park on the right, and the driver's blade is then horizontal
above the air intake, dirty water remaining on that blade flowed off the left
end and right across the driver's field of view leaving a muddy streak. Just
that simple. Of course, it was a simple matter to change the park position to
the other side and many did, eliminating the problem. There were so many
complaints about it that the factory changed to the present parking location
.. I changed my '66 912 and then my '68 911 (both bought new) but can't recall
whether my 914-6 was built after the production change was made or not. This
subject came up on PorschePhiles a few years back which I answered and
subsequently Bruce Anderson and I discussed it. He may recall when the change
was made by the factory.
BTW, changing the park position is a mechanical adjustment at the motor. No
wiring changes are made (or would work, anyway.)
