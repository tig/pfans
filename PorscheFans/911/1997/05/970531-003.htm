Mark, I've had a bunch of 911s, and I can tell you without hesitation that
the 993 is the best Porsche ever--and by such a wide margin that it would
be silly to buy anything else.

In your price range you can get a good, clean '95 993 with no more than 12K
miles. Wait until the new Porsche 996 has been previewed in Geneva in
September, and I'll bet you can do even a little better. (but you won't
regret buying now and having it for the Summer)

A 12K mile 993 is a great car-- the rings have just seated, and it's not
yet ready for its third set of rear tires.

While the tire store may love you, the dealerships say they simply do not
see these cars except for routine maintenance (which is very infrequent).
They appear to be 'bulletproof' in terms of overall reliability.

I've had two, and they are the ultimate 911--and the one most likely to
retain its value as the new car comes out, IMHO. The '90-94 range had some
problems, and is the least attractive of the later Porsches, esthetically.
