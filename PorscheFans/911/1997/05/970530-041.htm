Chris,
  I asked my mechanic the same question today as we looked at the used B&B
oil cooler, porsche hard lines and thermo we will be installing next week,
and he says that over many many years, he has only replaced a half-dozen or
so thermostats, the original porsche ones are usually OK even used, but if
they do go bad, it is easier to replace than to fix.
