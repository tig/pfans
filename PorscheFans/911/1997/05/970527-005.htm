Pfans:
Well it took a bit but I finally got the electrical gremlins out of my =
75.  I started with a known bad alternator that was replaced this spring =
along with the voltage regulator.  From there I had the battery going =
dead and a double dash turn signal indicator blink when the either turn =
signal was on along with no dash indicators for the turn signals with =
the head lights on.  FWIW I'm pretty well convinced that the double =
blink business is caused by low current flow.  At any rate in no =
particular order I found. 1.  corroded connector at the battery for the =
lead to the primary fuse panel. 2.  A shorted relay that was wired =
direct to + 12 from the battery to the fuse panel.  This relay was for =
an after market AC and was installed such that the pins could short =
together if something was put on top of it in the luggage compartment. =
The something being our overnight bag the day the battery died going to =
the PCA NE region spring ramble.  It was wired with a fusible link not =
fused.  The link is rated at 30 amps.  An intermittent short (randomly =
blew the fuse) at a wire connector for the interior lights, clock and =
clove box.  The ground return for the headlights was wired to through =
the marker light bulb voltage lead.  This was seen as the very dim dash =
panel turn indicators with the headlights on.  And last but not least =
after all of the above a crocked battery which came as no surprise.  So =
now its back to my dearly beloved CIS air leaks.  Current plan is to try =
to seal the air box before breaking down an buying a new one.  I guess =
I'm just into pain but after tracking through everything else on the =
leak problem I want to try to fix it at least once.=20
