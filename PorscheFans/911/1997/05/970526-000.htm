Don't see too many jokes posted but I thought this one might go over
good. 

 A hip young man goes out and buys the best car available: a 1997,
 Porsche 911 Turbo.  It is one of the fastest and most expensive cars in
 the world, and it costs around $100,000.  He takes it out for a spin and,
 while doing so, stops at a red light.  An old man on a moped (both
 looking about 90 years old) pulls up next to him.  The old man looks over
 the sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks, "What kind of car ya' got
 there, sonny?"

The young man replies "A '97 Porsche 911 Turbo. They cost $100,000."
"That's a lot of money," replies the old man.  "Why does it cost so
 much?"

"Because this car can do up to 180 miles an hour!" states the young
 man proudly.   The moped driver asks, "Can I take a look inside?"

"Sure," replies the owner.

So, the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.
Leaning back on his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car,
all right!"

Just then, the light changes, so the young guy decides to show the old
man what his car can do.  He floors it, and within 10 seconds, the
speedometer reads 120 MPH.  Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear
view  mirror that seems to be getting closer!  He slows down to see
what it  could be and suddenly,  <whhhoooossshhh!>  Something whips
by him, going much faster!

"What on earth could be going faster than my Porsche?" the young man
asks himself.

Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him.
<whhhoooossshhh!>  It goes by again, heading the opposite direction! 
And, it almost  looked like the old man on the moped!

"Couldn't be," thinks the guy. "How could a moped outrun a Porsche?"

Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror!  And this time, it
appears to be heading right for him!!   
<whhhoooossshhh...a-BbblaMMM!!>

It plows  into the back of his car!  The young man jumps out.  It is the old
man!!!  Of course, the moped and the old man are both racked up.  He
runs up to  the old man and says,  "You're hurt bad!  Is there anything I
can do for  you?"

The old man groans and replies, "Yes.  Unhook my suspenders from
 your side view mirror!"
