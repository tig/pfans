Steve:
Once you've stripped the car it is no longer considered to have the 
original paint, even if you re-paint it Metallic Silver. You have simply 
repainted in the original color.

That said... it's your car, man. If you want to paint it 'purple' do it! 
Why should you give a sh*t what anybody else says. It's a 'ballsy' color 
- grab your cajones and go for it. 

Only...
Try not to get lost next to the Rice-Rockets and Mustangs! If you're 
worried about resale value... no problem. Slam a boom-box in it and ship 
it to East L.A.
