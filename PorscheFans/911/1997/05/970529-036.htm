    Here's some more material for your book, Henry:

    Not only does the park-on-the-left design clear the driver's side
    FIRST, it also clears it LAST... So intermittent-wiper action
    (whether manually or automatically achieved) is more efficient.

    Interestingly, the old factory racing 911s always parked their
    wipers on the RIGHT, even when they were left-hand drive. Check
    out the picture of the 1975 Carrera RSR (on page 2 of the
    December 1996 Pano) for an example.

    I would expect that you could get the same wiper behavior on
    your street car by simply swapping wires on a relay somewhere.
