I have 3 problems areas - can anyone help?

1.  On the Factory wiring diagram for 72-73 911s, it states that my car
has fitted a "thermo-time switch".
What is this for and where is it located?

2.  I am considering fitting 911S-style oil lines and cooler inside the
front RS-style spoiler I have bought, in order to help the engine run
cooler in summer etc.
I have heard that s/h 911S oil lies etc are rare and that the NOS parts
cost mega$$$.  Has anyone had these oil lines made up for a 2.4 911?
What is the inside diameter of the pipes (in mm)?  What material is best
(steel/copper/aluminium)?  Do I need a 1972 2.4S oil filter console or
can I use my current T one?  I have heard also that Mazda RX7 oil
coolers are much cheaper and work fine inside the RS front air dam - any
opinions?

3. I'd like to convert my 925 sporto to an 915 five speed down the
track.  Which "year" or version is best to fit?  
Do I need to change the CV/drive flanges etc?  Anyone who has done this
conversion and has any tips re pitfalls etc, please email me below.
