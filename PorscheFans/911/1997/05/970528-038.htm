Bruce,
I am 6-4 with a long waist (32 in inseam ) equal to about 6-8 sitting.  I 
found a great solution.  The seat is a Corbeau Forza.  It has no shell using 
Parelli webbing instead.  This seat sits about 1.5 in lower than the sport 
seats in my Carrera.  I ordered their seat bracket with the seat and had it 
modified to gain another inch.  The total setup is 2.5 in lower than the sport 
seats.  I change seats for track events.  It only takes about 10 minutes and 
is part of my normal prep.  The Corbeau is not adjustable except for and aft 
with normal sliders.  The seat and bracket was only about $400.

Subject: 	Help, Max Headroom!

I've recent acquired an '88 911 coupe, great condition, I'm thrilled.  It
came with a sunroof and without sport seats.  I am 6 feet tall and
proportioned such that I can't sit in a proper driving position with a
helmet on.  I expected this and have budgeted for seats.  I borrowed
(temporarily) a Porsche sport seat and it is much better but I'd like a bit
more.  Even with the sport seat the compromise position has my arms a bit
too extended.   (I'm just glad my helmet is a Simpson; Bell helmets are
taller and the problem would be worse!)

I'm told a Recaro track seat with normal rails is not any better than the
sport seat, maybe worse.  But, if I get the racing rail set-up for the
Recaro it'll get me down abit further than the Porsche sport seat.  Can
anyone give me feedback on this?

Also, has anyone else gone through this with any other after-market seat
solution?  Sparco?  Corbeau?  

Maybe if I hadn't stood up straight when mother told me to I'd be bent now
and would fit the car!!!
