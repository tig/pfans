        On 5/25/97, Eric Brown inquired:

Todd, et al,
     
Don't most, if not all, states regard driving as a privilege rather than 
a right? 
__________________________________________________
        You are correct.  In all states I'm aware of, driving is a 
privilege, not a right.


I assume this is because roads are built and owned by government 
agencies and there is nothing in the Constitution granting us rights 
specific to driving on public roads. Hence the government agencies can 
stipulate the conditions under which licenses to drive will be issued.
     ________________________________________________________
     This is also true, and is why you're hearing all of these "tidbits' 
     from Pfans members recently regarding their home states suspending 
     their licenses for not paying tickets in foreign states.  The 
     limitation, of course, is that states must treat citizens equally, 
     under the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution, which I 
     mentioned in the post to which you are replying.
     
     
BTW, I am not an attorney, I just play one in my fantasies!
