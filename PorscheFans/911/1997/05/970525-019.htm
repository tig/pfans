Early 911 Fans

Well now I'm confused.  I'm ready to bring my '73S Targa into the shop
for a bare metal, windshields out (yes the rear one too) and all trim
removed $5000 paint job. 

The thing I need to decide on now is whether I want the car painted the
stock Silver Metallic color it is now or....cringe.....paint it the
color my first S was repainted to....Aubergine (Eggplant or Dark
Purple).  My SO loved the Aubergine color and is starting to convince me
that the car would be much more unique with an Aubergine paint job than
with (in her words) the old man, boring, conservative color of Silver
Metallic.  I really tend to agree with her.  I never thought I'd own a
silver car.  Sure they always look good in showrooms, but when you bring
the car out in the sunlight....well, silver just looks kind of plain.  

I don't like red either...too common...so is silver for that matter and
white...yuk!...NO WAY...talk about conservative.  I'd like to some
advice from the Early 911 fans.  What do you think of the color
Aubergine?  I sure havent seen many 911's with that color.  But it looks
great on the ones that I have seen.  At night it sort of looks like
black or a very deep dark purple.  

What other colors would you recommend which were offered for the year of
1973?  

The STANDARD colors offered were Bahia Red, Emerald (Viper) Green, Sepia
Brown, Light Ivory, Aubergine, Light Yellow, Tangerine, Signal Yellow.  

SPECIAL ORDER colors for '73 were..Gulf Orange, Rose Red, Signal Orange,
Ivory, Irish Green, Leaf Green, Lime Green, Jade Green, Glacier Blue,
Gulf Blue, Oxford Blue, Royal Purple, Olive, Beige Grey, Black, Gold
Metallic, Metallic Green, Metallic Blue, Gemini Metallic, Silver
Metallic.

I think that the value of the car would not be changed by changing the
color to a stock '73 color, right?  I've heard that the fact that it no
longer has the original paint devalues the car the most.  

Thanks for the advice
