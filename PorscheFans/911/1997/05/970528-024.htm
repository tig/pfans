     I have purchased one of these devices before and asked my coworker
     to test it on his cat.  It did not work.  In fact, my coworkers
     cat started to hug and play with it.

I have seen adds for devices you can put in your garden to keep rabbits 
away.  They produce ultra-sonic noise that is not pleasant to animals 
that have better hearing than humans. I have never tried this and I dont 
know if would just piss off the cat or whether it would keep it away. 
Maybe check out a gardening or cat newsgroup.
     
If you mess with the cat you will probably lose the girl as she will 
take the cat over the Porsche.  Treaties can be made. We have 3 Porsches 
and 8 cats.
     
FWIW
