I think that, unless there's something wrong with your braking system,
you
shouldn't *need* a cool down lap.  I had a similar experience to yours a
few years ago (although, luckily I was able to more or less keep the car
on
the track).  Scared me to death.  The thing of it was, there was nothing
wrong with my brakes - the problem was with the driver.  I was using the
brakes too much.  By braking later and harder, but for a shorter period
of 
time, I was able to avoid having this problem again.  I now drive the
car 
much faster than I was when I had the brake fade and have not a problem 
since. 

I empathize with you, but the *last* thing you need to be worrying about
when screaming down a front straight is whether or not you're going to
have
any brakes at the end.  Bleed the bejeezus out of the brakes and try not
to
use them as much.  Maybe the higher speeds of the RSA vs. the 914 are
causing some excess use of the brake pedal?
