 Tell us it ain't so...Joe. You just forgot to put that funky l'il Happy
 Face thingy after your comment. Right. Oh, you just remembered it

 Into the breach, dear fellow... You can have him!
 
 
 
Last time I checked, we all have the right to fight for our rights
without the fear someone is going to kill our famililies.
 
 Stranger than fiction.
