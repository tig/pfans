The 2.7L did have some problems but was a great engine nonetheless. My friend
put over 100,000 miles on his S version. The biggest problem was the head
studs pulling out of the case. Most of these motors have been rebuilt by now
and hopefully had timeserts installed along with new stud bolts along with
other upgrades. There are a lot of 2.7s out there so parts are plentiful and
inexpensive. One benefit of the older cars is a weight of only 2425 lbs. I
don't have the exact figures but as the engine size grew so did the weight.
The newer 911s are about 500 lbs. heavier so even with the larger stock
engines they were not that much faster if at all. My 74 911S has been totally
restored along with a super custom 2.7L rebuild. She has radical cams, race
pistons, 11.3 to 1 comp., twin plugs, and a whole lot more. I also have about
285 HP and duplication of my engine would cost you about $15,000! So the
moral of this story is when you buy any older car buy the one that has had
the most work done. You'll pay more money upfront but less headaches in the
long run. If you are interested my baby is for sale.  She is perfect and she
ain't cheap. Email me for a facts list. If you look at any older Porsche
please use my list for a comparison.
