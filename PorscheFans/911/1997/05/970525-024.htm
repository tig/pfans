Phfearless Drivers:
Most states have "point" systems, but the points awarded for say "Speeding 30
miles over the limit" vary from state to state quite a bit.  Might be two
points on your record in New Mexico but one point in Texas, for example.
In this case, when the NM conviction shows up on the computer in your TX
driving record, it is the TX point "award" that obtains.  Or at least it was
the last time this mattered to me, a number of years ago.
BTW, for 30 over in rural NM you need cash or credit card on the spot, no
personal checks if you're from out of state.  And those rolling hills between
Farmington and Albequerque are great for hiding "pop-up" radar police
vehicles.
