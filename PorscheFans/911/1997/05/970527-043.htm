Personally, I like the early 'S' cars but it's all opinion.  An interesting
comparison is between the '70-'73S series and the 911SC.  They look similar
in some ways (0-60 and top speed are similar, as I remember).  The SC has a 
bullet-proof engine, air conditioning, power windows, and cruise control.
It also has all that weight that makes it harder to corner.  It also doesn't
have that wonderful high-revving engine.  It's all an opinion thing.  Drive
different cars and see what you think.

The 2.7 liter engines have an average life expectancy of 50K miles.  I've 
heard of longer life spans but that seems to be the expectation value.  This
is because the thermal reactors added a lot of heat to a cylendar that 
expanded at a different rate from the head bolts.  It's possible to rebuild 
the engines to be more sturdy (and the '74 and '77 cars seem to be more
sturdy by their nature).
