Shirish,

I had a problem with my seatbelt light coming on intermittantly.  I =
checked the sensor and it was Ok.  Took the car to the dealer for a =
quick Bosch hammer read.  1 hour later I went down to check on the =
progress and they had my dash apart.  Said that there was no indication =
of a fault code so they were looking at the bulb/dash.  Didn't find =
anything wrong so they suggested a new 'brain'. Considering the cost, I =
decided to wait. =20

It hasn't come on since!!!  Don't really know what the problem was.   =
The old - take it apart and put it back together and it works syndrome.  =
Probably a loose connection in the dash.

Good luck,
Scott Kelly
