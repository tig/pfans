Hello everyone, I just got back from Alabama- picking up a 1979 911 Turbo
with my friend/business partner.  I liked the car so much and it is in such
good shape that I am seriously considering buying it from him and keeping it
for myself.  (A black/black Turbo would look very nice in my garage next to
my black/black 928S4!)  Anyway- I was curious, what is the last year for the
non-catalytic converter 911 Turbo in this country?  Would a Euro-car be a
good choice (I think the answer to this will be no).  I want to know what is
the newest model year Turbo that I can buy that isn't restricted with
converters and horrible Turbo lag.  Anyone out there have a car for sale?
 I'm just want to check out all my options before purchasing the car that we
picked up yesterday.  Thanks in advance.
Brian (how many Porsche's do I really need?) Buxton
