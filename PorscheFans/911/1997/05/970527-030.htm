Ken,

I have some experience with this topic.  I have a 1987 911 Coupe.  The car
is absolutely pristine with 52k kms on it (about 35k miles).  I had
problems with the clutch and wrote Porsche Cars (here in Canada at the
time) and they set up an appointment to meet me at the local dealer.  A
regional service rep came out and we talked about my problem.  You see, I
got the clutch fixed before seeing this fellow.  The pressure plate had
developed a hairline fracture and didn't hold the pressure when depressed. 
The disk and bearing were all MINT, however, I replaced them anyway.  I had
to argue my point that there is no reason for this disk to go like it had
with this kind of mileage, year, and shape of the car.  To make a long
story short, Porsche paid for the pressure plate and I was happy.  I went
ahead and got a non-factory trained mechanic to do the clutch work for me
(a clutch is a clutch, and he had 30 years European car experience).  The
rep tried to weasel his way out because I had the car serviced at a
non-dealer, however, I proved my point that if they are using SACHs
clutches and didn't stand behind them, this is the real problem, not who I
chose to install the at first faulty unit anyway.

Porsche upgraded the tranny to the 950 in 87 (great unit I might add)
however, they didn't do any upgrades to the clutch other than make it
hydraulic.

Joe

PS - hope this helps.
