The optional 16" wheels for the '87 and '88 (standard on the '89) were
16x6 and 16x8, so the rims Jim is looking at are an inch wider all around.

"Recommended sizes" from Bruce Anderson's book go as far as 16x7.5 front
and 16x9 rear, with 205/55-16 front tires and 245/45-16 rear tires.

To quote (and I hope you don't mind, Bruce...) "The older cars '78-'89 will
have front tire clearance problems. We have been putting the 911 7x16
wheels on the front with the standard 205/55VR16 tires for some time now.
They will usually hit on a lowered car, and it can go either way on a
car that is not lowered."

So... it sounds like if you want the 16x7 fronts, you may need to do
a bit of work, i.e. roll the fender lips. I dunno if you'll have a problem
with the rears.

Hope this helps!

Ross
