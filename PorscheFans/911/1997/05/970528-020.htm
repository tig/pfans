<<My question to the group is ....what is wrong with this picture?  Have
there been problems with this car.  How could it have depreciated so quickly?
 It seems like the performance deal of the century.  Please respond with
comments or know problems with this car.  I want to buy one soon!!!! (3.6
turbo owners please tell me your experiences).>>

Joe-
One date and two words for you:  1996 Twin Turbo.  Market values are odd...
if you want the 3.6, buy the 3.6  The only problems with them is that Porsche
came out with something newer and much different.  Check out prices of
pre-1997 Corvettes.  There's nothing wrong with them (except for the fact
that they are Corvettes), but the prices are going south.

P.S.  If you are looking for one soon you might want to give me a call.  I do
locating and brokering and can find you a great car for a great deal.  I
specialize in Porsche and Mercedes Benz.  1-812-464-8777
