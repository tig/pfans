Hi Mike

Sounds like you're getting close to instaling that Bursch muffler!

I woudn't support it by the cylinders, athough I don't really know if
it'll harm anything.  It just doesn't seem like a good idea to put that
kind of shear stress, or bending torque, or whatever you want to
call it, on the head studs.  I'd support it with some bocks under the
crankcase.  Another solution, one that I've used, is to lift the engine
with an engine hoist about a foot or two, and work under it.

>Also, is there some recommended procedure to loosening the nuts.

An amost infallible solution is to heat the nut till it's cherry red.  You
might
have to go through a few heating cooling cycles, but almost always once is
enough.  A propane torch usually won't get it hot enough, although you can
try.  'Real' muffler men use oxy-acetylene.  I've had good success with the
little unit Bernz-O-matic makes that uses an oxy bottle with either a Mapp
gas bottle or a propane bottle.  The Mapp is hotter.  The units are available
at most hardware/houseware places.  Cost about $50, if I remember correctly.
You can even do a littlebrazing and welding with it, but don't expect too
much.

> Several came off pretty easily (though I had to use a weird combo of socket,
u-joints, and extensions),

Par for the course.

>I had thought of using a propane torch,but ruled that out since I figure the
>nut would cool off by the time

It's the heating **and** cooing cycle that frees the nut.  Let it cool!
