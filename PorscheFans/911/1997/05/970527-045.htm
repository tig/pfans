Hi

Thanks for the support on my planned color change.  I really like the
Aubergine color also.  It definitely got attention on my last '73S
Targa.  I live in San Francisco.  I'd love to see some photos of your
car.  If you've got some extras please send them to this address:

Maybe I can get them up on my website http://www.sirius.com/~stevew. 
You can see a pic of my first 73S Targa on the site.  

The paint shop I will be using, the owner, is not too happy about
changing the color of my car to Aubergine from Silver Metallic.  He says
that its going to cost a lot more for the color change.  How difficult
was the paint job on your car?  I don't really care about the inside of
the trunk since it will be covered by carpet and the original silver
paint in my engine compartment has changed to a yellowish color, the
clearcoat I believe has yellowed.
The only other area that may be a challenge to paint it the inside area
where the door and the rear of the front fender meets.  Where the
antenna is mounted.  Other than that I don't see why my painter would
have to charge me a lot more.  His price of $5000 already includes 
removing the windshields.
