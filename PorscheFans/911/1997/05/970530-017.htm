Hi All,
I have been told by a reputable tire dealer that using
a plug is not always considered the best way to repair
a tire.  The example he showed me was a tire that looked
like it had a very bad flat spot when in fact it had a plug
that did not seal the air at the inside most layer of rubber.
Apparently the plug sealed the outer most layer of rubber
and allowed a bubble to form between the tread and the 
belts.  So someone had a P7 with half tread left on 3/4
of the tire and no tread where the plug was. So the tire
store got to sell him two new ones.  This store 
recommends taking the tire off the wheel and putting 
a patch on the inside, this also allows a look at the 
hole from both inside and outside so if there is any 
significant damage to belts it might be seen. The guy 
at the tire store did not say that a plugged tire was 
unsafe, just that the repair might not allow you to get 
the full life out of the tire.
