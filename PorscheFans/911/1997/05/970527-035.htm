here's a challenging engine noise question for those who have seen it all on
p-cars:

i checked my cis pump and control pressures, and removed 2 of the fuel
injector lines from the fuel distributor to gain clearance in the process.
 pressures all good, hook lines back up.  i also replace intake runner boot
on #1 cylinder, which requires removal of intake runner from cylinder head.
 when re-installing intake runner on studs, i notice i am short 1 washer,
which i attribute to PO's engine rebuilder.  add a new washer, and button it
up.

Start car next day, and runs ok for 15 seconds, then a horrible knocking
starts, frequency follows engine speed.  I shut car down, try it again, it is
still there.  I try and locate the source, but seems to be from "everywhere".
 however, after 20-30 seconds of severe panic and anxiety, the noise is gone,
and never re-appears after a test drive.  my heart rate comes back to earth.

so....did I drop the intake runner washer into the intake valve pocket, gave
it a tilt-a-whirl ride in cyl #1, and then spit it out the exhaust?  or did
the fuel injection have air in it, and something weird was going on in 1-2
cylinders (starved for fuel)?  

Opinions, please!!  thanks
