These devices are called guard straps or  hydro straps.  They are an safety
strap in
case of total tensioner failure. Don't touch them. They are installed at a
predetermined
height (a little metal shim comes with them to set the height) If they are
all the way at the bottom I would replace the tensioners. If  you go with
930 style (the latest that  are not oil fed /carrera style) you will also
need to buy  shimms or  update the
arm that the sprocket is mounted to (this is the preferred method other then
going with
the Carrera style). Either way most failures are due to binding of the
sprocket mount, and the guards  make the tensioner a solid one. With the
guards it is recommended that one inspect  them  every 20k. Figure about
$500 to upgrade to Carrera style and  upgrade the sprocket arm...... where
does it stop? 'pends on what level you want to go:-)
