The only other area that may be a challenge to paint it the inside area
where the door and the rear of the front fender meets.  Where the
antenna is mounted.  Other than that I don't see why my painter would
have to charge me a lot more.  His price of $5000 already includes
removing the windshields.

In reply to the painting of p-cars, at my shop, aptly named Series 900 , 
The removal of the doors is a must. The pins are easily punched and
the right config of tape on the door/fender seams for protection of paint,
therfore the loss of door alignment is eliminated. Occasionally I find stub-
born pins which leads to bolt removal. after the door is off, pop the pin,
clean it and the bore, reassemble for alignment purposes, pop the pins
and paint those door jambs the way the factory did?off the car!!! This is 
the only way i know to eliminate tape lines on the jambs. I also paint lids
off, standing upright to eliminate any surface dust. Ofcouse every Pcar
paint job is topnotch but, the customer always says "its not a show car"
$$$ is directly related to hours and the care and craftsmanship of the
artist, choose an enthusiast to paint  yours. As far as the color, your a 
big boy now :<) !! what ever turns your crank, Remember somewhere
there is a perfect 911 out there in original no mileage condition, yours
is not that one and unless steve is an alias for Ralph Lauren, meaning
$$$$ is no object for the absolute, chill out, make it yours and do a 
nice job. As far as " not a show car" , one of my customers then 
entered a local pca concours, forgot to enter as novice first timer, yet
scored 100% on paint points. Matter of fact I do not believe the judges
even knew it was a repaint! That was a 77S choc. brown w/77k. 
    Not knowing the condition of your car, 5k is up there, I start at 3.5
for diss., wetsand, paint, buff, reass. New parts and body work not
included nor the color change in the caverns. As a help in taping the
caverns, cover the motor w/plastic and remove as much extraneous
bolt ons as possible and wrap any odd shapes with aluminum foil 
rather than masking tape. Same up front with wiring harness. This is 
worth the add.$ 500 you were quoted. Also the pins in the doors ride
in bushings, replace them if there is any hint of slop. I have found
the need to then ream to the correct tolerance at times, but oh that
teutonic thud will return to your door closures. Windows are always
removed, make sure they know how to handle those precious mldngs.
Check all your trim for damage with the shop before they take it apart.
This will save you griping later. Ask that it be wrapped seperatly and 
stored safely in the interim. Its a hassle for both sides, yet prevention
is worth it, IMHO one bitchin customer is one to many.Other paint/
body ?s      
                 Shiny side up!
