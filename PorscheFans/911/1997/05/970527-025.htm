As I was one of the people that started this thread...

I tried the silicon spray on the guides and it definitely made a
difference. However, it's clear that there's still some binding
happening. I now really believe it's the window regulator as Jeffrey
implies. I plan on pulling my door panels next weekend and greasing.
Remember, my car was in storage from '90 to '97, so it's very likely the
bearing surfaces are dry. I'll report what I find.

The lubricant isn't for the cloth, it's for the guides inside.  The
cloth seals tend to loosen up, if anything, with age.
