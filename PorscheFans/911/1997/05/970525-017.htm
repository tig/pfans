Howdy,

My 1972 911S leaks fuel from somewhere around the top of the fuel pump,
which is located in a housing under the driver's side torsion bar tube.  At
first it leaked like a sieve, one to two drops a second only when the pump
was on.  I began to investigate the problem by trying to move the pump out
of the housing to see what was going on.  Well, I ran out of ambition that
day and left it.  After that, it barely leaked, say a drop every 30 seconds
or so only when the pump was on.  Today I began looking into the problem
further and ran into some problems.  I pulled the pump out of the housing
and turned the key until I could hear the fuel pump humming away.  When I
looked under the car it was leaking very badly, so I turned the ignition off
and it still leaked.  There are three fuel lines hooked up to the top of the
pump in a line.  Also, at a 90 degree angle to the fuel lines is a large
nipple with a metal cap that appears to be press fit(clamped) onto the pump.
The fuel seems to be coming from this nipple, but it is hard to confirm if
it is coming from there or from the base of one of the lines and wicking to
that point.

Any experience that anyone has had with these fuel pumps would be greatly
appreciated.  I figure my next step is too pull the lines off one at a time,
cut an inch off or so off, reinstall it, and hope.

Thanks,
Greg Gable
