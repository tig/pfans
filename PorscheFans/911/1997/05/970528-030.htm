I just bought a 1987 Targa after having a disastrously inadequate pre buyers
inspection. The car has 70,000 on it and never had a 60,000 service. The CV
joint boots are torn, it may need brakes and a clutch. I've been seeing the
discussion about 1987-89 clutch problems and have heard one mechanic mention
something about the bearing guides. My clutch is very stiff and has a very
high release point. Will simply replacing the clutch with a new OEM clutch
correct these problems? I also have a mysterious squeak in the front
suspension which has been sprayed with lubricant almost everywhere to no
avail. To make it worse the squeak is intermittent. Any suggestions? I do
love the car and fortunately probably paid what the car was worth
considering the expense facing me.
