Steve,

To conserve the resale value of the car, paint it the color on the
Cardex (silver). This is emotional-less advice that only considers how
much $$ you will get if you must sell the car.


More subjectively. How much silver paint is visible throughout the nooks
an crannies of the body/trunk/engine compartment? If you can see any
silver I think you should repaint silver. But this is simply what I
would do. I like silver for 911s. Silver is a Porsche racing color from
the 550 spyder days.

Purely subjectively - if you really don't care about resale value, then
paint it the color you like - eggplant. You will not recover the cost of
the paint job for many, many years, if ever.  Since you are paining it
for your pleasure, you should get the color you like.

I wish my car was getting  painted. But I spent all my $$ on mechanical
restoration and the interior (carpet & new Reccaros).
