On "marking" your territory:

Something that might be helpful:  most cats really don't like the smell
of citris and oranges and stuff like that.  If you can find a way to
get a citris scent around your car you might be able to keep the cat 
away.  A friend of mine mentioned this method in relation to keeping 
her cats off her counter tops.  It worked.  Of course a citris smell in
the kitchen is not a bad thing.  It also didn't hurt the counter tops.
I can't say how it would do for anything else since it is a mild acid.
Try cutting open an orange and then go pick up the cat.  See how it 
reacts.  It ~almost~ never hurts to try.  =)

Someone else mentioned the squirt bottle.  If you have patience and time
to sit out and watch your car until the kitty jumps up on it this does 
work eventually, but be warned:  my roomate and I tried this on her cats
to keep them off the counters and once when we squirted the cat as it 
was up there (it took many times to train the cat btw) it got so freaked
out by the sudden blast of water that it ran right into a glass vase
causing it and the cat to fall to the floor.  The cat was okay, the vase
was not.  I really can't say what a scared cat might do to a car when
this happens.  Note:  I do not think this is cruel in any way to the cat.
Its only a little water and it makes them think twice about doing whatever
they did again.  
 
These are just a couple thoughts, good or bad.  Best of luck!
