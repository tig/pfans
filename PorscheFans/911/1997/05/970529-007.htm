Hi,
	Well, there have been a set of perfect white 16" Factory Fuchs
rims off of a 911 turbo for sitting for about two years at a local
performance store.  The owner has dropped in price to $800.
I believe they are 16x7 and 16x9.  

My '87 911 is begging for a new set of tires.  I still have the
stock 15"(?) Fuchs rims on it.  It's a stock '87 911 Carerra with the
standard (non-turbo) flares.  Currently I've got 205's in the front
and 225's in the back.  I'm not sure on the ratio.  The car is white.
The current Fuchs are black.  The 16's are white to match the car.

My question, will these rims fit, and what spacer/tire combination
do I need to avoid rubbing.  I am not willing to roll back the
fender lips.  Are these worth it, or should I look into a
different size/setup?  The car is a pleasure vehicle.  Basically
for fun driving around town(backroads), flying down the highway,
and the occasional beating of mustangs.  It probably won't see
much if any track time.
