    Well, since you asked so nicely and all...

    The NSX is an awesome car, but the tall gearing really IS pretty
    stupid; a friend of mine replaced his stock ring-and-pinion
    with a lower (numerically higher) aftermarket R&P, replaced the
    stock 2nd through 4th gears with shorter gears from the
    Japan-market-only NSX-R, and instantly gained two to three
    seconds at Laguna Seca.

    Even with the short gears, though, the NSX will never be a
    competitive autocross car.  Its wheelbase (longer than a 914's
    and MUCH longer than any 911's) and its very wide track were
    designed for stability at very high speeds; on tight autocross
    courses or on VERY tight, twisty roads, a 914 or 911 in the
    hands of a skilled driver will do better than the NSX.

    On the other hand, you're right about the BSX's abilities at
    higher speeds; right out of the box, it's faster than almost any
    other car on the planet.

    More importantly -- and this really can't be emphasized enough --
    it's EASY to drive the NSX really fast... Almost anyone can do
    it.

    I don't want to start an NSX-vs-Porsche thread here (I've
    participated in enough of that on the NSX mailing list), but I'd
    like to repeat a couple of comments I made on the PFans-944 list
    about nine months ago when the same subject came up there:

        My Porsche has the same personality as the mid-engined 
        Ferraris that Luigi Chinetti, Jr., desribed thusly:

        "They're not friendly.  They don't say, 'Let's go for a
        ride.' They holler, "Hey! Wanna go for a ride?  Me, too! Let's
        see who wins.'"

        ....

        If I had to anthropomorphize the two cars, I'd say that the
        NSX is like a publicly-reserved-but-privately-lusty wife, and
        the Porsche reminds me of the psychotic nympho girlfriend  
        that I DIDN'T marry.

    My P-car, by the way, is a 1973 914-6 conversion with a 2.7-liter
    Euro Carrera RS motor, short gears, serious suspension, full
    cage/race seats/harnesses, and flashy Chalon bodywork.  The NSX
    is a 1994 model and is totally, completely, absolutely  stock
    (unless chrome-plating the factory wheels counts as a
    "modification").

    P.S.  If this discussion's going to continue, let's move it to 
          the "Tavern" sublist where it belongs, ok?  I've already 
          crossposted this response there.
