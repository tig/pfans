Pfans,

I can relate to the cat problem.  The problem with the car cover
is that you have to do it every time you leave the car (sometimes
I just ran out of patience).  Forget it once and it can cost you.

Another issue is that I noticed my cat prefered sitting on the car
with the cover on... as a result, encouraging the behaviour.
You may say "so what, as long as the cover is on".  I'm not sure
since I have seen him really dig in to get a grip (under high
G-force situations :)

Net result, car cover more or less solved the problem until one
day I left it off and WHAM three DEEP rear claw scratches all the
way to metal on the right rear fender.....  :(   Most car
enthusiasts get a sick feeling in their gut as they imagine
clearly the cat jumping up, not getting a good grip, and thrashing
rear legs to pull up rather than admit to looking stupid and
backing off to make another run at it.

(Yes the cat is still alive)

(This is the same cat who "did some bad bird" and ended up getting
very sick and costing me $1200.00 in vet bills.  He promises
to get a summer job and pay me off but so far he has few usefull
skills and seems unemployable :)

(Please no flames from the "WHAT?? 1200.00 on a CAT?  ARE YOU SERIOUS?
crowd.  Believe me I have heard all sides of this debate and
for some people it's a clear economic decision and for others
it's more complicated.  Suffice to say we are not likely to
resolve it here.... :)

IMAGINE my disappointment and angst over this
until I caught a RACOON on the hood (with the car cover on).
The racoon was predictably non-plussed and looked at me with
bored condescension until he chose to leap off the car.  Perhaps
on purpose, he dug a rear toenail DEEP into the paint to leave
another down to the metal....  (that makes a total of 4 now.  grrrr....)

At this point I figure I may as well just drive about 25 yards
behind a gravel truck for 10 miles or so and be done with it....
