I think the Bosch rep is wrong about that last point.  There is nothing in electronic 
theory that says that the spark will be impeded initially, and hotter when it happens, 
due to series resistance in the discharge path.  Series resistance does reduce the 
current in the spark, meaning that there is less energy in the spark.

I think that the relatively high resistance (5,000 to 10,000 ohms) in the rotor and 
connectors is necessary to reduce EMI to an acceptable level for radio reception when 
solid wires are used, period.  And before spiral-core wire became available, solid wire 
was the only alternative to the horrible, short-lived carbon core type.
