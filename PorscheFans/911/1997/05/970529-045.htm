Hi Phans,

Uhh, I don't know if I should be sending this. It sure won't get me
invited to Daytona next year...

I need the list's post-incident analysis of my braking failure after a
140 mph shunt that has deeply bruised my ego and been none to kind to
the paint and left fender of my C2. Specifically, with the C2s power
brakes, how do I know when it's time to do a cool down lap or tour the
weeds?

First, let me say this is my 5th season of track events. This year I 
transitioned from a '75 914 2.0 to a '93 RS America. The learning curve
is steeper than I anticipated. Yesterday was the first dry track event
of this year. I was enjoying progress in getting the tail under control
and developing a deep appreciation for the fine brake system, since the
C2 seems to explode from corners where the 914 sort of ambled. Checking
my gauges on the long front straight I marveled at how cool the C2 was
running compared to the 914. Then at the end of the straight, after no
problems at the previous corner the pedal went clear to the floor. No
sweat I thinks, that's what the gravel pit is for. Well, we (the car and
I) cleared that pit in no time and finally smooshed up against the tire
barrier. The front bumper and rignt fender are not pretty, but I was
able to drive it to the body shop, so probably no worries there.

Ok, the car was probably screaming hot brake messages at me for a couple
of laps, but with these newfangled power-assisted brakes, I wasn't
picking it up (whereas the 914's pedal very, very clearly telegraphed
fade with higher pedal pressures.) In general, the body language of the
C2 is much more muted than the 914 (except for tail twitches). 

Next question, even harder to ask, what should I have done differently
once the pedal went to the floor? There was some brake there, but not a
whole lot. In my surprise I just stood on them and held the wheel
straight to avoid flipping in the gravel. Should I have been pumping
furiously to build up pressure, or was it already gone?

One thing's for sure. I'm gonna test my brakes in mid-straight from now
on, maybe even pit once in a while.
