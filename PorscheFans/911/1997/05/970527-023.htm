    Hi all,

    I test drove a 1994 3.6 Turbo last week.  WOW !!!  I could not believe
    how quick it was (much, much quicker than the 3.3 turbos I have
    driven).  During the test drive I nailed the throtle at about 3000 RPMs
    without any turbo lag the salesman and I were launched into the next
    block.  It produced such high g forces that when I let go of the gas
    (without braking), we lunged forward to the point where the seat belt
    retractors engaged.

    These cars were $110,000 new in 1994.  I have seen several for sale in
    the mid to upper $60s with 7 or 8,000 miles.  This car does the 1/4
    mile in the same time as the 993 Twin Turbo.

    My question to the group is ....what is wrong with this picture?  Have
    there been problems with this car.  How could it have depreciated so
    quickly?  It seems like the performance deal of the century.  Please
    respond with comments or know problems with this car.  I want to buy
    one soon!!!! (3.6 turbo owners please tell me your experiences).
