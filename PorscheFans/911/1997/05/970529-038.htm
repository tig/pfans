    Pat's right, but the Bosch rep may have been confusing "resistor
    plugs" with "booster-gap plugs".

    Before CD ignitions became commonplace, Champion (and maybe some
    other manufacturers, as well) sold a line of sparkplugs which had
    about a 3/8-inch gap in the center-electrode conductor, inside
    the porcelain plug body.

    The gap was a pretty clever idea... As the coil voltage slowly
    rose over a period of, say, 100 microseconds, energy would be
    stored on one side of the gap until the voltage was high enough
    to arc over the internal gap.  At that point, the voltage at the
    spark plug's center electrode would rise VERY quickly (like, in
    just a couple of microseconds) and the plug would fire
    immediately.

    Booster-gap plugs reduced spark duration and total spark energy,
    BUT they had one big advantage over "normal" plugs:

    If the plugs were fouled or wet, the slow-rising voltage on
    normal plugs would tend to leak off the center electrode; if the
    plugs were badly fouled, they might not fire at all due to this
    leakage.  With the booster-gap plug, though, the slowly-rising
    energy from the coil would build up INSIDE the plug, safe from
    external leakage sources, then would be unleashed through the
    center electrode so rapidly that leakage would hardly affect it.

    Of course, modern CD (capacitive discharge) ignitions perform the
    same function -- they store slow-building energy in a capacitor
    and then dump it into the plug very rapidly -- so booster-gap
    plugs have, as far as I know, disappeared from the marketplace.
