Hey PFriends, 

I have a question about the relay panel in the engine compartment. I was
cleaning and checking fuses the other day in the trunk and decided it would
be a good idea to also check the rear engine compartment relay panel. After
taking off the cover I discover that the POC or someone had disconnected one
of the "relays" in the panel. I say relay loosely because it's not a standard
relay the plugs in not is it an item that is illustrated in the Haynes manual
for that compartment. It's a smal black square box about 1.5" x 1.5" x .5
high. It has louvers on the top and is held in place by one screw. It has two
wires running to it (1 of which is disconnected)  that originate in the
overhead firwall on  the left side and also have a couple of other leads
coming out of it. Anybody got any idea what the heck this thing is? I'm
hesitant to reconnect it before I figure out what it is and by the looks of
it condition wise it should probably be replaced, not to mention that someone
already disconnected it for some reason.
