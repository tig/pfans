Thought I'd pass along a quick and easy way to bleed the brakes that I used
over the weekend.

Going back through the archives, I found messages that potentially the
"pump the pedal" method with blowing the master cylinder.  I also found a
message suggesting building a pressure bleeder that required a pressure
regulator.  Didn't like any of those so I did the following.

I built a pressure bleeder in the following manner.  I purchased an extra
brake reservoir cap for an '84 VW Rabbit ($5) and removed the hose off a
cheap floor pump ($free).  I then pulled off the splash fitting from the
inside of the cap.  Drill through the vent hole in the cap and screw on the
hose (don't strip or you may need to bolt from the rear).  You end up with
a cap that has a hose attached to it that you can attach to a tire.  Now
you need to fill the reservoir and PLUG THE VENT LINE (remove the line and
replaced with a short section of vacuum line that you plug).

I raised the car, removed all the wheels (good time to rotate the tires).
I place one wheel in the trunk and used the tire pressure pressurize the
system.  I didn't keep the airline connected the whole time only while
bleeding.  Keep an eye on the fluid level in the reservoir and remove the
plug on the vent while refilling.

Lessons:
1.  Make sure you have a way to refill the tire.  When I was done, the tire
had 1 PSI in it.
2.  Drop the initial pressure in the tire to 20PSI.
3.  When refilling the reservoir, remove the plug on the vent, otherwise
you cannot refill the reservoir fully.

This trick cost $5 and lets you bleed the brakes and rotate the tires in
less than one-hour.  Next time, probably only 30-minutes.
