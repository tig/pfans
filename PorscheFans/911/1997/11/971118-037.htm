Ron,

I've gone to 23mm front and 28mm rear.  This is in a race car.  However, I've 
raced on the street at Steamboat Springs (very bumpy) and didn't find the ride 
noticably harsher.  This amounted to about 1.5 hours in the car and I was 
concentrating on other things so this impression may be suspect.  Adrenalin 
may add padding to your nether regions.  (A theory that I hope to continue to
explore for years to come).

The handling was significantly better.  I raced Steamboat the previous year 
on my stock suspension and inside front wheel lift was reduced from 6+ inches 
to less than 2 inches.

Just keep in mind that I was racing rather that cruising.  My tires (which may 
have aleveated the ride harshness) are Yoko A008's at 25 PSI front and 28 PSI 
rear.  The car is stripped and weights approx. 2100 lbs.  which could tend to increase 
harshness.

I guess I have no advice for you  one way or the other.  When my car was on 
the street,  I had mountain driving daily and would have liked something stiffer.  
If you are on country roads or are thinking of AutoXing, you may want to go to 
22mm/27mm.  It really is a personal decision.

RMVR is Rocky Mountain Vintage Racing and #916 is my car number.  9/16 is 
my anniversary and choosing this number kept my wife from examining the racing 
budget too closely the first year.  This strategy did not work the second year.

the bar or it gets rusty.


This is my understanding also which prompted my question when I heard that
they may wear out.

>I just replaced the bars on my '67 for racing and the old ones were well
greased with no rust or nicks and my mech told me to keep them or sell them,
that they were good.  Do you want to buy them :-)?

Thanks for your offer, my bars are in similar condition. Would you recommend
thicker torsion bars for street use?

What does RMVR #916 mean?

Ron.
