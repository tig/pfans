    Kevin:

    I use Redline oil and change it every 6000 miles, but I change
    the filter every 3000.

    Sure.

    No, but it's becoming more and more common.

    The problem ONLY occurs when someone crossposts a message to
    multiple P-Fans sublists to which he's not subscribed.  Most of
    the repeating messages are "for sale" ads, since those are
    generally the ones that people crosspost to all ten sub-lists.

    The "general@porschefans.com" sub-list was created specifically
    to remove the need to crosspost, by providing a place for
    Porsche-related general-interest messages.  The "Tavern" sub-list
    serves more-or-less the same function for general-interest
    messages that AREN'T strictly Porsche-related.

    Evidently, though, some people just don't get it... So we end up
    with "944 parts for sale" ads crossposted to all the lists
    including the "356" sub-list, dumb jokes that we've all heard  
    posted to the "Tavern", "General", AND "911" sub-lists, etc.

    Then, of course, stupid and/or ignorant people reply to those
    repeating messages, copying their RESPONSE to all ten sub-lists,
    too.  If those respondents aren't subscribed to all the lists to
    which their messages get copied, THEIR messages repeat, too.

    None of this would happen, of course, if the list were run using
    halfway-decent software (i.e., AMERICAN software, rather than
    British)... But Pete Albrecht has washed his hands of the
    Porschefans list, and its current "operators" don't seem
    particularly interested in doing anything to improve it.
