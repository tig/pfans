Hello Harley, and PFans,

I'm the fool looking to replace the Bosch "Hammer" (and thanks for
telling us why it's called that) - actually, I'm *not* looking to replace
the hammer - that does indeed sound like a formidable task...

All I'm trying to do (and it's starting to sound impossible) is read any
trouble codes, or sensor data from the DME.  I am still very confused
that our 84-89 911's have no *check engine* lamp at all - This morning
I re-read my owners manual, and again, no mention...  I've seen these
check-engine idiot lamps on ECU cars for 20 years, so what gives?

On the factory wiring diagrams, the only diagnostic-looking connection
is the three pronger in the engine compartment.  A semi-quick check last 
nite under the dashboard revealed no OBD, or pre-OBD style diagnostic 
connector - @#$%^&*.

It seems, that the only way to read this data is with the *hammer*, a 
device which is a non-serial based diagnostic tool, thus, no easy
connection to a PC... :-(

Perhaps an easier solution is to just make a *break-out* box, to connect 
between the DME and it's connector, so that all the sensors could be probed
easily w/ an oscilloscope... (I realize an o-scope may be missing from many
PFans toolboxes, but hey, it's not from mine! :-) )

Thanks again for the input, and I'll keep everybody posted,
