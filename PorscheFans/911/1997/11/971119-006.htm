Hey Pfans -

I've been looking for a replacement for the Bosch 9288 "hammer" -
does anybody know how this tool works - I'm assuming it hooks 
up to the diagnostic port on the DME (I've an '89 carerra, BTW)
and reads data serially, at say 9600 baud...?

Last nite I hooked up my oscilloscope to the "test connection" A
in my engine compartment (of which there's A, B, and C) since
my wiring diagram shows this going directly to the DME... (pins
B and C are for stopping the Air Idle Valve, so the bypass can
be adjusted).

Heres what I saw on pin A:
Ignition off, A is at ground.
Ignition on, engine off, A is at 12 volts (battery voltage, but also a
RS-232 logic level)
Car started, A is at 12 volts for a few seconds, then goes to ground.
A stays at ground, unless engine is revved, then goes to 12 volts as
the engine decellarates, then back to ground at idle.

My conclusion is either this is NOT the port for diagnostic testing, 
or, pin A is some kind of bi-directional serial port, and I need to send
some data to the DME before it will spit out useful info...

If anyone has useful info on this diagnostic port, even if they've only
seen a pwrench use it, please pass it on - if I can get my hands on 
the serial port, I'll write us some software we can all use to connect 
PC's to our DME's and read sensor data directly, like on the Motec
units...

TIA, and sorry this got longer than I had originally planned :-)

PS - James Soffit wrote about not having a use for his cig-lighter - shame!
You all need to go out and buy a CB, monitor channel 19, and (like here)
listen for a while before you talk... The friendly (really) big-truck
drivers will
tell you where all the local, county-mounty, DOT, and full-grown *bears*
are!
