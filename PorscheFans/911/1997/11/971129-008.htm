After recovering from excessive amounts of food and drink Decided to
measure out the ride heights on my old beast.  Left rear has been set way
to low by the joker that supposedly did a complete alignment and geometry
set up.  Did the alignment alright but looks like he just blew off the
measurements.  I need to raise up the left rear a bit.  On looking at the
set up seems there are two eccentric bolts there that are for alignment
purposes.  If I take the arm off to move it up on the splines of the
torsion bar am I going to screw up the settings of the eccentrics?

This looks like a project that is loaded with gotchas.  Any suggestions or
BTDT tales and tricks?  Since I gave my 914 to my son to use at his duty
station this is my only daily driver and I cannot afford to have it down
for any length of time right now. Don't want to get in and find I really
can't get out easily

TIA
