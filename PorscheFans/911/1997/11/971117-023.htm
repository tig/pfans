Hi greg
Before you go pulling out the old oil return tubes try re-seating the seals.
Mine started to leak, but now they don't -10,000 miles later. Heres what I did:

From under the car carefully clean oil return tubes and espesially where
they join head and crankcase, then to re-activate/ re-seat the seals gently
rotate oiltube and at the same time move axially each direction as far as
you can.
My car (an 88 euro coupe) had done approx 50,000 miles then, I think this
was the 1st time the oil tubes had been touched. The Thermoplastic
rubber/Viton seals where still quite soft and elastic. Now done 60+ and oil
return tubes are as dry as a bone.

If this doesn't work - hey nothing lost - on with expanding types.
