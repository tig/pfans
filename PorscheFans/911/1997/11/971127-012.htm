Hello all, kind of new here.

First, the pop-off valve is also known as a blow-off valve, or bypass valve.
They are installed on the intake usually after the intercooler, just before
the throttle body.  I haven't looked in detail at a 911 turbo, but have an
Eagle Talon turbo that I have done quite a bit with.

There are usually 3 openings on the blow off valve (bov).  The inlet, the
outlet, and a pressure sensor for a vaccuum hose.  The valve is designed to
release unused pressure from the intake system(inlet side of the valve)
under non-throttle conditions.  This release presure is usually vented back
into the intake system before the turbo-compressor inlet.  In other words,
if you step on it, then let off, the vaccuum created in the system is
designed to open the bov and allow it to de-pressurise the intake charge
before the throttle body and because of smog regulations, it is vented back
into the airbox, or at least before the turbo.

This does two things.  It reduces the amount of backpressure on the turbine
wheel when you let off which can cause it to slow excessively, stop, or even
in high boost cases try and force it backwards.  This isn't good for
performance, or the bearings.  It also by removing the pressure from the
intake, allows the turbo to spin up to speed faster.  


Second, I am looking for a set of blinker assemblies for a 1970 911e.  I
have headlights, new fenders, but need the entire setup for both sides.  If
anyone has any leads, I would appreciate it.  Dealer was looking to pay a
year's rent on just the sale of them to me.

Best Regards,

Brett
1970 911e 2.7
1995 Talon Tsi
