Finally caught up with mail on the above having been away and having
owned Targas for some time wanted to pass on some tips. There are a
number of points worth looking at in the quest for a 'dry' car, so here
goes.
1. 	Check the height of the door windows,with the continual movement 	up
and down the mechanisms wear and the window rises too far. 	The effect
this has is to distort the rubber stop fixed to the 	top of the vent
frame window channel. This then digs into the 	rubber seal along the top
of the window and in most cases is the 	place where the 'drip' finds its
first point of entry.--- Cure 	No.1 is to adjust the height of the glass
by taking the panel 	off and depending on the year of car making the
alteration. Cure 	No.2 is to replace the rubber stop at the top of the
vent frame 	channel.
2.	The seals attached to the roof that run along the top of the 	side
windows are adjustable - but no one ever does it, so the 	glass and the
seal never sit tight to one another. There are 	five Phillips screw that
hold the seal to the roof, look inside 	the holes in the seal, unscrew
them a couple of turns and the 	seal should move. It may be tight so you
might have to give it a 	good pull to get it started. Best done with the
roof in place.
3.	The side windows do not sit square after a time due to wear in 	the
lift mechanisms, so again take off the trim panel and make 	the
adjustment. Depending on type there have been at least two 	types of
mechanism used by Porsche, I think they changed around 	1980, the later
one has being more adjustable.
4.	The side glass can also be tilted inwards at the top to get a 	better
fit, the adjustment points are hidden at the front of the 	door under
the large rubber plugs, and at the back behind the 	plugs at the top and
bottom of the door.
5.	The catches at the front and pegs at the back of the roof are 	also
ajustable. To get access take the roof off and look behind 	each item
and the socket bolts will be seen. These can move the 	roof closer or
further away from the rubber seals as required.
6.	The seals need to be kept in good condition, coat them with 	either
talcum powder or vaseline at regular intervals, do not 	use Armourall or
the like on them as the seals dry out and loose 	their flexibility.
7.	The seals need to fixed down with adhesive all along their 	length or
water will ingress. Especially the rear seal over the 	hoop. It is not
sufficient to just seal it to the bottom of the 	channel, it also needs
sealing along the back or upright face to 	the hoop.
Tips 1.	Wind noise is often caused by the front edge of the roof 	
material sticking up above the screen rail- especially if the 		material
has been replaced. The material needs to be pulled over 	the frame and
tensioned correctly  when neing replaced and 		unfortunately often is
not.
2.	The material on the seal down the rear edge of the side glass 	can be
replaced without having to replace the whole seal. It 	does not take
long only lots of care. The best material to use 	is a polyester cotton
of the type used in making clothes. Not 	only will it tidy up the shabby
old seal but it will last longer 	and it stays 'black' for much longer.
Also it is a very low cost 	repair, a good source of this material is
the skirt worn by your 	wife or girlfriend, I leave you to negotiate how
best you get 	hold of it!!!
	This repair can also be made on Cab's to good effect.
	Best to use a slow setting adhesive, in the UK I use Copydex, 	which is
a creamy fabric adhesive for use on carpets and paper, 	so there may be
something similar in the States.

I hope this is of help, I know these work because I have been doing them
for years on different Targas and they sure get tested over here with
our weather. Contact me on tonyabacus@mcmail.com if you need more help.

ps	The later top with the roller catches can be put on the earlier 	cars
if you change over the front rails. You have to locate the 	forks in the
next position down but it all goes together OK. The 	pins that go
through each end of the rail are held underneath 	with a circlip, once
removed the pins can be 'eased' out but 	watch out for the plastic
washers.
