Greetings, 911 people!
I'm a regular on the 928 list and I just signed on to the 911 digest to find
out: a) How many of you are on, and b) If you're having as much fun on you
list as the landshark gang.

There are about 900 of us on the 928 list, mostly North America, but with
some Euros and a few enthusiastic Kiwi's who have spare apostrophes and other
punctuation for sale cheap.  They'll take good used leather sport seats with
extra lateral support in trade.  Sorry, inside jokes   ~~<|;^-}=    When I
post this the list will confirm with the 911 list's current membership count.

It looks like you're having a good time with the usual range of topics from
microfiche manuals to wheel/tire combos to those damned electrics to humor.
 (Interesting, you guys joke about porcupine pricks and we 928-ers glom onto
bovine road kill.  Dr. Freud, are you out there?)  The main difference seems
to revolve around the 911's longer lifespan and the resulting wider variance
in car conditions, power and mods.

Like the 928 list, your discussions are more civil and erudite than the rude
& crude POC chat line.  They seem to have trouble distinguishing between the
1st Ammendment right to say something and whether such utterances are worth
saying.

If you want to find out more about 928's check out Phil Tong's magnificent
web site at  http://www.928s4vr.com

Enjoy your sweet-revving cars and don't hesitate to wave*.  Landsharks only
bite if provoked!

* We 928-ers say "keep the shiny side up!"  I thought of signing off with
"keep the pointy end forward" but it's a bit hard with 911's to tell exactly
which end that is!
