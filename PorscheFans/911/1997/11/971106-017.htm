It could be (after having debugged similar things with mine):

	- rear toe difference
	- corner weight imbalance
	- uneven tire wear on front, rear, or all

Other may have other observations based on their experience.

My guess: either too much front toe-in for the conditions you're describing
(it's a tradeoff of better turn-in vs. straight-line stability), or tires that
develop more slip angle than what you want.  Tires vary a lot -- I replaced my
Michelin XGT-Z with Firestone SZ-50 and the handling was *substantially*
improved -- including much better steering response.

Absolutely YES!  I spent a few weekends tuning the rear ride height and corner
balance.  The first weekend was w/o the wrench and I'd never do that again: it
is hard to loosen and tighten the front bolt (of the two adjustment bolts) at
all without it, let alone develop the torque needed to get it to spec, and it
lets you do very well controlled adjustments on the eccentric bolt (the rear of
the two).  The wrench pays for itself in 10 minutes if you're going to do a few
ride height iterations.

Sounds like you're having fun!
