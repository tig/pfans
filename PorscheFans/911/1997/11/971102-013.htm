 Adnan-     It is very, very easy for a novice to wreck his first 911. Many 
do. I almost did when I got my first rear engined buggy 15 years ago, but I 
was very lucky. If an inexperienced 911 driver lets off the gas and/or brakes 
in mid turn, or even applies so much gas as to break loose the rear wheel 
traction, the back of the car may well pivot around like a pendulum, and then 
you and the car leave the road backwards. This can happen very quickly. 
	This actually happened to me on a rainy night less than two weeks after I 
bought my first 911. At about 45 mph, I came around a curve, and I saw a 
branch down in the road; I swerved and braked to avoid it. In a split second, 
I was spinning 360 degrees, and all I could do was wait for the outcome. I was 
much more fortunate than many, as I slid across someone's lawn and came to 
rest in his hedge... I had to paint a fender and door,   and buy eight new 
hedge bushes... pretty lucky, wouldn't you say? The more recent cars such as 
you are considering buying, are somewhat more forgiving, but they are still 
rear engined 911's. It can still happen. Be careful, but have fun. 
	One can still cut safely with a sharp knife, or go skeet shooting with a 
loaded shotgun; for me, the awareness of some danger makes for a more 
exhilerating experience. If not, I would drive something competently dull, 
like the  Nissan Altima you mention. I recommend getting some advice and help 
from experienced 911 pilots. Join the PCA and go the driver's ed classes, 
maybe? Yes, you will indeed find a 911 drives differently than a Nissan 
Altima, Adnan.... Warren.
