Troy,

I installed the PP short shifter in my 1967 911 and am very pleased with it.  (My driving instructor was so impressed he put one in his car before the next race).

A word of warning which may or may not apply to your car.  When I put mine in the shift linkage going to the back was lowered so close to the floor of the tunnel, it interfered with the heater cables and their housing.  Since I was converting the car for the track, a hammer fixed the problem (moved the housings out to the right & left).  The housings are welded to a tunnel cross brace about 2 inches from the front end of the linkage.  As the linkage moved from side to side, it hit the housing.  The heater wires were not an issue but the housing is very in-flexible.  The weld had to be broken.
