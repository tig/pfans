Mark:  I was afraid after I read my writing that this might be
confusing.  I ment by inner channel, innermost into the rubber and not
to the inside of the car.  I guess I should not write these things a
3:00 A.M. because the old mind gets a little foggy at that hour.  Sorry
for the confusion.
Nevertheless the key was that the glass goes into the channel that is
the most difficult (of course).
