Having digested all available materials on the 996 I've made some 
observations and come to some conclusions:


1) The Boxster commonality - a matter of economics.
2) Road and Track test: "a lot of tire squeal even with the optional 
18 inch wheels" Paul Frere test: "A nicer car that the previous one, 
but not more fun to drive"
3) Size and comfort levels much improved over the 993. (All reviews)
4) Autobilt: "They've taken the soul out of the car ...etc."

My humble opinions:

A) The 996 looks like a 911. Different but still no mistaking it for 
a Mazda.  Consider the changes from the 901 to the 993 and the 996 is 
not such a radical departure except for the headlights which I agree 
suck.

B) Porsche has positioned the car against the Mercedes SL series 
which out sell the  911  by significant numbers. The 996 in its 
initial configuration is more GT like with very high performance 
tempered by a softer ride and quieter interior with some more usable 
space. 

C) Notwithstanding the GT tendencies, the 996 has better performance 
than a 993 and better brakes. 

D) Go find a picture of the 996 Supercup race car.  Like me, I bet 
you find it very very attractive.  I *want one*!

E) Like me, be patient and let Porsche come out with the "Club Sport" 
version for all the track junkies like us. If it even slightly 
resembles the Supercup car, we will be happy. 

F) Let's hope that the 996 does increase Porsche sales into a volume 
market where the average buyer expects a degree of sophistication for 
the high price paid.  For the average street driver, a 993 cannot be 
called sophisticated, suffering from marginal A/C, no storage space, 
aerodynamic noise not present even in economy cars etc.  Before you 
jump on me, this stuff is all window dressing to a trackie who 
appreciates the car in its natural element.. which is not cruising 
down boulevards in upscale neighborhoods. 

G) I am betting Porsche will soon give us a less luxurious sportier 
version of the 996 which will make us forget about the 993, SC and 
earlier models.

H) LET US ALL BE GRATEFUL that by positioning the first 996's against 
the 500SL, BMW 540, Lexus SC etc. the resale value of our noisy - hard 
riding- pure unadulterated sports cars will be preserved for a few 
more years!  I remember when development at Porsche was seriously 
restrained by US. They guys who owned the previous year's model who 
didn't want to see resale prices drop sharply because of far superior 
technology.  That held back the 911 until 89 when the 964 came out 
and the cork was finally pulled with the 993.  By placing the 996 in 
a different segment Porsche has been able to not only offer a more 
sophisticated car but prevent our air-cooled versions from taking the 
pipe resale wise. We own sports cars. The 996 is not a sports car 
(yet). Very clever of Porsche I think.
