Wow, what a thought, having a 930 as a first Porsche. You are a lucky man, 
Stan! 
	However, I have often heard of 930's that were wrecked by fellows unfamiliar 
with the quirks of rear engined cars (ie: their tendency to lose traction in 
turns and spin out when driven by inexperienced drivers). I used to know a guy 
who died when he let his brother drive his black 930 in the mountains in NC 
ten years ago (brother survived...).The regular 911 is a little tricky, but 
930's are well known to be really dangerous beasts to the uninitiated. Their 
wondrous capacity to spin the rear wheels instantly in most any gear makes 
them very tricky. The 930 is a beautiful but unforgiving mistress, I think. To 
take her powers lightly is foolish indeed. 
	Please learn to drive your beautiful beast properly. May I suggest a driving 
school course at a race track? Lots of fun and well worth it! You are driving 
the closest thing to a race car on the road. Sorry, I am not trying to rain on 
your parade. None of my business really, no offence intended, but just my 2 
cents worth. Here, help me down from this soapbox, please...Good Luck , I envy 
you, take care, and Enjoy! Warren.
