Has anyone had any experience with the company known as "BAT" located in
Sarasota Florida?.  I have contacted them regarding an auxillary coller for
my 72 911T.  I am installing a 3.2 and this company has a system which uses a
bendable, corrigated type stainless line instead of the usual aeroquip type
hose.  The stainless line will transfer heat as well as the cooler itself
claims the company.  A friend of mine faxed me a copy of an article from the
Virgina area detailing the installation of one of these coolers for a 72 911
with a 3.6.  I live in San Diego and keeping cool is a real issue.  Seems
like a good concept, but before I make the leap, I was hoping for some
feedback.  Any comments appreciated.

Thanks, 

Jon Martin
