That control unit (the lever carriage on the dash) is a nightmare. They
probably were telling you that by the wrench got the unit out, replaced the
cable and reinstalled it would cost more than just putting a new one in.
You however, depending on how many puzzles you have successfully solved
over your lifespan, could disassemble the mess and use a generic cable to
replace the broken one. Of course, you risk a nervous breakdown should
another cable break shortly after you survive the replacement of the
current broken one!

Seriously, I have not had a broken cable, but I have been "in there" and it
is not pretty.
