My understanding is that Bosch makes a general purpose system and then,
depending on application and exclusivity, the car manufacturers modify it.
For example, the DME in the 911 is the same as that in a BMW, only with
different software and pinout configs. The 84-89 911s were not fitted with
external diagnostics, but data may be present in the DME. The breakout box
idea is a good one, proving you can find the connectors. Given the age of
the system I would imagine that this is not as hard to do as it once was.

A multichannel logic analyzer with tunable input ports (some of the lines
are driven by power transistors) would be substantially better than an
o-scope for the analysis. HP, Tektronix and others make them and you can do
a signature analysis or store a time series so that interdependencies of
the signals can be observed. I imagine this is what the chip tuners do. It
would be fun to have a laptop replace the DME. Imagine the dynamic graphs
that it could pop out. You could have control profiles for maximum economy
while buzzing around town and then hit the escape key and blip onto a
maxima on the power curve. Certainly experiments with adaptive control
would be possible, imagine a Kalman predictor optimizing performance
dynamically. So many good ideas, so little time...
