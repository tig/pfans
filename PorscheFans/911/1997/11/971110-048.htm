A couple of weeks ago I wrote that our "73.5 911 (with CIS) has a new and 
annoying habit. Just driving along, at low revs or high, the engine stops dead for 
a few milliseconds then continues. It's as if someone switched the key off then 
back on. There is also occasionally a backfire. Any similar experiences out 
there?"  

I got a number of replies which I didn't see on the list. I include them here, 
slightly edidted to save space, for anyone out there with this problem.
	
My '73.5 has done that several times in the past. I.ve had the car since new & 
had the cut out problem a couple of times several years ago... Couldn't real find 
a problem; it would run great otherwise. Finally decided it was ignition related, 
but couldn't find any fault. It could have been the distributor wires grounding 
out ? I have been getting the car back on the road after a 15yr storage & had a 
similar problem again recently. It would not have a complete shut-down, but 
would be more of a stumble at speed... Last summer I drove up to Gingerman, 
ran for two days; car ran GREAT. On the way home it started stumbling about 
once every 5-10 mins. I also noticed that the tach needle would swing back and 
forth around the dial. I was down to about 1/4 tank of fuel, so stopped for fuel. 
After the fillup, no more miss. Don't think that was the problem though.. Still 
think it was ignition. Car didn't backfire, but that's a sign of lean mixture. After 
talking this problem over with my enginebuilder, we concluded it was probably 
the points. He says he has had the problem several times due to bad "new" 
Bosch points.. He's talked to the Bosch rep about this & says some of the new 
point sets aren't as good as the old ones. You might want to put a new set of 
points in. Or, run a piece of clean thin cardboard ( matchbook cover) with 
electric cleaner on it through the gap. I did this several times on mine, Don't 
know if it solved the problem, but I haven't had the miss for several months.... 
 
If the tach swings wildly with the stumble, the problem is in the electrical 
system; if not, fuel. Your tach is electronic-- triggered by the points.

My '76 does the same thing - except it **only** does it when I turn left! I 
bought a set of gauges, etc. to test the CIS system.  I'm going to get to the
bottom of this. 

I'd check your points(in the distributor) I found that approx every 5K miles, they 
start to accumulate carbon from the rotor. You can clean them by inserting a 
business card or replacing them. 911T w/CIS.

I've had a similar problem.  in fact, two similar problems.  i have a '75 911S with 
CIS. the first problem was quite vexing: the car would occasionally cough, or 
quit, or hesitate briefly on acceleration. revs would stay constant instead of 
rising. Very annoying, couldn't find the cause. Finally, the fuel pump quit, and 
the mystery was solved. New fuel pump, no more problem. Now, about a year 
later, some part of the ignition (cd box, distributor, coil, etc.) system is going bad. 
Periodically the tach will bounce around randomly and the engine will misfire.  
When it gets bad enough, i open up the distributor and clean the points. I have 
to do this every hundred miles or so.  really annoying... so the take home 
messge is:  watch the tach.  if it stays steady, the problem is likely to be fuel; if it 
flails, or drops to zero briefly, look to the spark. I still don't know the cause for 
the second problem...

Sounds like a fuel delivery problem, Its likely that the electric fuel pump is 
failing or its connector is intermittent.  Those cars don't use a fuel pump relay. 
Don't forget the propensity of those old ceramic fuses to give this same sort of 
trouble. The fuel pump fuse is in the engine compartment. Clean the points 
with a business card, that will confirm if the surfaces are contaminated.Good 
Luck.  Usually an erratic tach will communicate the need for points problems. 

I experienced the same problem in my 1975 with cis, I replaced the fuel filter. 
When you take the old filter off..tip it upside down into a bucket & see how 
much sediment there is...your gas tank may need to be purged). 

My 73.5 will do that when the gas tank is near empty.  If the fuel pump sucks air 
the engine will die instantly.  As soon as fuel is present again the engine restarts.  
I suspect you are experiencing some form of fuel starvation for those few 
milliseconds.

My l975 911 S Targa was doing exactly the same thing!  I asked my
mechanic about it, and he recommended a new Permatune CD box.  That 
seemed to help for a short while (100 miles or so), then the problem came 
back.  Turned out the main problem was contaminated points. New points 
seems to have solved the problem. One P-fan who replied to my request for 
assistance at the time suggested that I try cleaning the contact surfaces of the 
points with a matchbook cover -- it's worth a try
	
Just to add my two cents on this...I had a 77 911S that did this same thing & it 
was very frustrating. Eventually, I got to looking inside the distributor & found the 
problem was with the plates that the points sit on. It has been over 10 years. I 
don't remember exactly but something was broken under them that was 
allowing them to vibrate around causing the engine to die from time to 
time....would only happen when I let off the gas to coast to a stop. Anyway, I 
bought a new 2.7 Euro Distributor & my problem was solved. 

For the record, the matchbook and some electric clean on the points seems so 
far to be doing the trick.
