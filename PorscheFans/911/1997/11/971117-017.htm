Hi,

My '73 911 has been making a clunking noise that seems to be coming from
the rear of the car. I have heard before that it may be a cv joint going
bad. I was wondering how I might check the condition of the joint with
out taking it apart. I did get under the car last weekend and I noticed
that the left drive shaft had little lateral play while the right
driveshaft had about 1/2+ inch of play (side to side, not up and down).
I am wondering if the play is causing the clunking sound as it bangs the
side of the transmission or drive axle. Could a broken circlip on the
driveshaft be the cause? Or could the clunking sound come from blown
rear shocks?

Also, can I just replace the rear shocks or is it necessary to change
all four at once to preserve balance of the car? The reason I ask is
that the front shocks were supposedly replaced 18k miles ago (3.5 years)
and I would prefer to oonly buy two shocks. If I do buy only two shocks,
is there a way to identify the brand of the front shocks by looking at
the nut or bolt that attaches to the frame in the trunk?

Thanks for your help,

Neil Kumpers

P.S. If this a repeat message I apologize, but my message didn't appear
