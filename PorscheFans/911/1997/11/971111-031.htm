Recently I did not drive my Porsche for about 4 days. When I attempted =
to start it the battery was dead. I recharged the battery and it ran =
fine for several days and then I did not drive it for several days and =
the battery was dead. I had a garage check out the battery and it was a =
practically new battery and they stated the battery worked fine but they =
could tell something was drawing upon it. Today I tried to recharge the =
battery and the indicator on the battery charger showed it was green or =
fully charged. I tried to start the car but it was so dead it would not =
even turn over once. Any thoughts appreciated.
