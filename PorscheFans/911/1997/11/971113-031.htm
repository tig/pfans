Mark, thanks for the info. I will add checking the brake lines to my regular 
inspection routine. My mechanic put them on; he is a very meticulous 55 year 
old Bavarian, so I am not worried about the installation. He felt they were an 
upgrade to the rubber OEM style.  thanks, Warren. 


I guess early on these lines were for racing only, and not DOT approved =
for road use.  They required frequent careful inspection and could fail =
if not installed correctly (I think you have to be real careful not to =
twist them).  I think sometimes the braiding could chafe the Teflon, =
eventually causing failure.  Neither issue was a problem for a race car, =
where the lines would probably get replaced often, and likely installed =
by a pro.

I think DOT braided lines are available now.  Still, I found new rubber =
lines to be absolutely firm.  A highly regarded local shop (Natick, MA) =
even uses rubber on their race car, not trusting the braided.  One less =
thing to worry about.  Good enough for me.

There are probably thousands of people using braided lines without =
problems, so you probably shouldn't worry about yours.  I just didn't =
see them worth the trouble, and I have no regrets staying with the =
rubber.

Hope this helps!      Mark
