I posted about this earlier this year, but I didn't solve it. Now when
we're finally getting into autumn here in CA :-) I hope someone can
help.

Problem: The fan shuts off completely if the thermostat is set to anything
that's warmer than temperature inside the car. This is even though I turn
the knob to max heat. This makes it very hard to keep warm or defog the
front window.

I don't know if it's the brain, some connector or the sensors that's not
functioning properly, is there a formula: FAN_ON = f(x), so as to know which
variables affect the fan? The electrical wiring-diagram doesn't help me.
I could also do with a crude fan control override switch...

The mechanic used the hammer and didn't find anything wrong, his 
conclusion was that the brain is bad. Assuming my mechanic was correct
the next step was to find a used unit, unfortunately the places I called
didn't have any in stock and claimed that they were popular. Maybe someone
out there has removed one and want to sell it???


Thanks in advance,
