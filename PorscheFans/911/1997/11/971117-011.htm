Well, there must have been a major solar storm in the past couple of
days as both the 911 (88 Targa) and the non-P car (Prelude) blew a fuse
in the same day.  What are the chances....

So my questions:

1) All my instruments except for the speedo were dead.  I replaced the
#11 fuse (16A, to the dash panel instruments) and in the process noticed
that there is a wire that has been cut on my fuse box.  It is connected
to the screw block between the #4 and #5 fuse (#1 being closest to the
passenger compartment) and I find no reference to this on the
description sheet that fits under the fuse box cover.  All systems work
as far as I know except the cruise control which has its own fuse from
what I can tell so I am wondering what the wire was to.  Anyone know? 
(I plan to have the cruise control diagnosed next time the car is in for
other maintenance.  I don't use it but hate to have a system not
operative. Symptom on cruise control : Don't work at all.  Hit the stalk
and nothing happens. Sounds like an electric/electronic issue to me)

2) My seat belt "idiot light" (on dash, below brake warning lights)
stays on even when the driver and passenger side belts are on.  I
noticed this for the first time today, the day after the fuse blew, so
naturally I wonder if there is any connection.  Anyone know?

Thanks.
