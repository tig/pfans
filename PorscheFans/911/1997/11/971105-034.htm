Phellow PFans,
  
Feel free to answer any or all...

Background:
 '86 Carrera 
 22mm front/29mm rear torsion bars, (87% stiffer f&r than stock)
 street tires, 
 stock sway bars, 
 last aligned 2 years ago
 pulls a little to the right on flat pavement
 

1. Under heavy braking my car likes to "wag" its tail.
  It has done this all this year and in my inexperience I
  just figured it was normal and I correct it now without
  even knowing I'm doing it. An instructor at my last Driver 
  Ed event told me, "No they don't all do that."  Could the 
  "fix" be something as simple as increasing the rear toe-in 
  or there other factors involved I should be aware of?

2. A racer friend drove my car and another friends stock
  '79 SC and noted that my car didn't "turn in" very well. 
  Is this an alignment issue or a question of not getting 
  enough "stick" in the front. If the latter is the
  problem would a thicker rear sway bar or torsion bar
  be the "fix" ?

3. I recently purchased one of those Smartproducts wrenches
  for adjusting the rear ride height. Has anyone else  used one 
  with any success?

  TIA,
    Chris
