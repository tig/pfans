Several owners have asked questions about where the fuse guarding
their fuel pumps might be.  There have also been questions about relays
for the fuel pumps.  I don't have any special knowledge of such details
beyond what I have gleaned working on my 77 (and very very minimally
on wife's 84, knock on wood), but I do have the first six factory manuals,
so I took a look at all the circuit diagrams over the years to see what they
revealed about fuel pump circuitry.

The first 911s had mechanical fuel pumps, so no such circuits were
there.  However, by the time the first E arrived, electric pumps were
installed.  These pumps were controlled directly from the ignition switch. 
This situation continued until the 1976 models, which were the first to
have a fuse protecting the fuel pump!  Before 1976 the hot wire from the
ignition switch was connected at a fuse terminal post to the wire which
leads back to the fuel pump, without fuse protection.  As James H. Taylor
surmised, this must simply have been a convenient place to connect. 
The other side of this fuse terminal, which is protected by the fuse, goes
to the fresh air blower.    

Additionally, it was not until 1976 that a relay was used to move current
to the fuel pump.  Up until that time it all ran through the ignition switch. 
This relay may not have been added for its current carrying capacity,
however, as it also serves as a logic circuit essential to the interlock
feature which prevents the fuel pump from running if the engine is not
running (unless you are using the starter).  

In a nutshell, the interlock (76 through 83) works like this:  back at the air
flow sensing part of the fuel injection is a switch.  When the air sensing
plate is closed (no air flow), this switch is closed.  When air flows, the
switch opens.  The switch, when closed, grounds the relay coil up on
the front fuse box (relay pin 85).  The relay coil at all times gets its
current (pin 86) from the ignition switch on position (red wire).  The same
red wire also is connected to the normally closed terminal of the relay
(87a).  The normally open terminal of the relay (87) is connected by a
yellow wire to the starter terminal of the ignition switch.  Both switches
in the relay are joined to a common output (30) which goes to the fuel
pump.

So, with ignition on and engine not running, the interlock switch grounds
the relay coil, which opens the "running" switch in the relay and closes
the "starter" switch.  When starter is switched on, so is fuel pump. 
When enough air flows to lift the air flow sensor plate and open the
switch there, the relay coil is deenergized, no current gets to the fuel
pump via the starter circuit, but it gets there via the red wire main ignition
circuit.  

If you roll your car up into a wad and are sitting there upside down
looking out at the world counting your blessings and wondering about
how you are going to get out of the car, but not thinking about maybe
turning off the ignition just for good measure, if the preceeding spin killed
the engine, the sensor plate switch will close, the relay will energize and
open the red wire circuit, and the fuel pump will stop and not spew any
gas out any ruptures which may have happened.  If the engine didn't kill,
but the aforesaid ruptures happened, with luck they will kill the engine
(since the CIS is dependent on 30-45 psi of fuel pressure at all times),
which will turn off the pump.

The factory procedure for turning on the fuel pump to test the CIS with
the engine not running advises bridging pins 30 and 87a of the fuel pump
relay externally.  I find it easier just to reach around behind everything on
top of the engine and disconnect the two pin interlock connector.  I knew
from past experience about the general functions served by all of the
above, but I won't tell you how long I looked at the circuit diagram last
weekend trying to figure out how it worked, and thinking of a most
memorable statement someone posted on this list earlier this year: 
"Thinking about all this made my head hurt."

Trina (whose post I couldn't relocate, and whose e-mail address
wouldn't work, according to my machine) wonders about why the
previous owner of her 77 cut off the #86 pin on her fuel pump relay. 
This has the effect of an open sensor switch, and means that the fuel
pump will run at all times unless the ignition is switched off.  Since the
factory didn't bother to prevent this until 1976, one might wonder if this is
something to worry much about, but I wouldn't consider doing this to my
car except as a field expedient to get me home.  I'd find out why a proper
fuel pump relay wasn't working.  If the sensor switch was stuck closed,
or if there was a short to ground in the line between that switch and the
relay pin 85, then the car would start on the starter circuit but
immediately stop when the key was released.

Trina also noted there was a diode inside the relay.  This diode is
intended to bridge the coil, not to carry current nor to be part of the
"logic."  According to the electronics books, when a relay coil is
deenergized, it produces a high voltage spike as the fields collapse etc,
pretty much like, I suppose, a spark coil.  The diode is intended to prevent
this happening, or at least to keep it from somewhere it will do some
harm.  The circuit diagram shows this diode.  Oddly enough, none of the
other relays for horns, fog lights, blower motors, etc have diodes
shown.  My 77 had a red relay in the fuel pump position, and black ones
elsewhere.  What the differences in their internals (if any) are, I don't
know, although the catalogs tend to differentiate.  They all seem to  have
the same number of pins, which may or may not mean they all have the
87a pin active.  

Perhaps someone with real knowledge will enlighten us all on these
arcana.  An automotive engineer in our midst?  Perhaps even explain
why it took so long for factory to put a fuse in the fuel pump line? I can
imagine various reliability considerations, but shorts can be really bad
news.  A short in a small diameter wire will probably just burn the wire in
half somewhere pretty quickly, making it only a pain to replace - it can act
as its own fuse.  A short in a medium diameter wire will set the insulation
and protective tubing on fire, and then the upholstery, plastic parts, etc.. 
Results (observed, fortunately, on someone else's pickup truck cab,
where blown fuses were replaced by progressively larger fuses) are
pretty dramatic.  I was disillusioned a bit when I found factory didn't
bother to fuse the kick panel auxiliary heater blowers when first installed
(I think) in '84, although later they did.  Most of us would like to think
Porsche's engineers know more than we do, given the extraordinary
overall product.
