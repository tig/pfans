Hi All,
   There has been alot of discussion about mounting a harness 
to a harness guide bar in the past.  We have done alot of 
homework on this issue to find out exactly what is needed to do 
this safely.
   We have developed a new product which has been tested and 
certified by an independent lab to exceed the federally 
specified loads for mounting a harness in a passenger car.  The 
required loads are much higher than most would think.  It took 
some serious engeneering to design a product that would do the 
job and not be incredibly heavy and/or cumbersome.
   If someone is telling you that you can mount a harness 
directly to your harness bar, you should ask to see the test 
results.
   More info is available on our web page (Brey-Krause) on the 
*Platz Mall http://platz.com.
   You can flame away for the commercial content if you must, 
but I think the information is important.

Good Luck,
Dodge
