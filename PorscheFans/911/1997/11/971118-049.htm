Yes.  I bought it back when I had my 3000GT and used it quite a bit.

>2) Does it really work?

Well, it gives readings.  The 0-60 and 1/4 mile acceleration times
checked out pretty well, but I couldn't get horsepower to make much
sense compared to factory ratings, (not that I expected them to).

>3) How does it work?

It measures your acceleration 400 times per second.  From this it
can determine your current speed (since you start from 0 with 0
acceleration) and using your speed and time, it calculates your
distances.

The most basic thing it does it time your 0-60 time.  It shows
you this reading in seconds.  If you continue on for a 1/4 
mile, it will give you your 1/4 mile time and speed.  If you do 
a 0-60 run, and then rather than accelerating, slam on the
brakes, it will time your 60 to 0 time.  Since it knows your
speed, it doesn't start till you hit 60, so you can zoom from
0 to 60, then on to 70 or whatever, and then brake hard and it
should give you the accurate reading for 60 to 0 braking.  (I
don't think it shows you the feet it took though).

It also has a G-Force reading.  You could place it sideways and
measure some lateral G's (never tried that!).

The last mode (I can remember) is the horsepower.  You tilt it
forward and backward to input your car's weight in pounds.  Then
you do something like a 0-60 run (really all you need to do is
go past your HP peak on your tach).  It will then show you your
peak horsepower.  This barely registered 140 on my 3000GT, though
the factory rated the engine at 205 (or something close).  The
factory rating is engine, no car, no drivetrain, no wind, no tires,
etc.  But this reading would be useful before and after a chip
or exhaust upgrade I imagine.

I haven't had time to check out my C4 Cab yet.  I daily drive it
and there is a straightaway with near zero traffic that is perfect
for 0-60 runs.  I don't usually have time to do a run on my way to
work though, and it is so close to work that when I leave, the
engine is still too cold to try hard runs like that.

Its only connection is into the cigarette lighter (finally a use
for it!).  It connects via suction cup to the windshield on a
small base.  The base allows you to set it completely flat for
accurate readings.  

This product will NOT give accurate results on an incline of any
sort.  I think its most useful applications are testing out
new upgrades for something other than seat-of-pants data, and
for finding good shift points.

My 2 cents,
