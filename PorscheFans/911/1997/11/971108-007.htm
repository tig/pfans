It also seems to me that the Turbos were "undersprung" and would
squat excessively under acceleration.  Watch one of the suckers from
the rear as it takes off and there is a considerable camber change
that, I'm sure, adversely affects the tire's contact patch and contributes
to a loss of traction.

Just an observation,
