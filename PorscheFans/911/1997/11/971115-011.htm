Walter, thanks for your tranny posts on the List. Lots of good info there. I 
particularly appreciate the technical stuff on "groinking" and "zizzing"..... 
	Yes, Walter, even after owning the car for ages, there are some parts I have 
yet to learn about. Over the years I have learned that falsely professing 
great knowledge leads to a certain unwillingness to ask questions, out of fear 
of bursting this illusion, resulting in continued ignorance. I thus admit to 
being far from omniscient, but I am trying to correct that condition... wish 
me luck!
	The tranny has never even been out of my car yet, original clutch and 
everything. But I have occasionally begun to notice a little clutch chatter, 
so I am guessing the rubber center of the clutch is wearing out? Am I correct 
in thinking I have a rubber centered clutch at all? Or maybe oil is getting on 
it, I hope not... Am I correct that if/when I replace clutch, I should go with 
a new and improved type of some sort?  I have heard of a "spring center 
replacement", are they good? So far, transmission shifts pretty normally I 
think, balky as usual going into first, and 1 to 2 is not all that smooth. 
These shifting peculiarities are all second nature to me now; if the car 
suddenly shifted perfectly smoothly, I would think there was something wrong! 
	Also, given that my car is a Garage Queen with only 45K on her, how often 
should I change the gear oil, and what kind should I use? Oil has not been 
changed in several years, but that only means about 7000 miles on my car. As 
there is no combustion taking place in gearbox (I hope!), I don't worry about 
acid and carbon such as I would were it old engine oil. But of course metal 
filings are likely there..I have noticed recent discussion on the List about 
new synthetic trans oils in use now....
	Furthermore, I was told that any friction reducing additives are bad to use 
as they somehow contribute to wear in the tranny (synchros?). This seems 
odd.... but I have taken this advice as truth because of its seemingly sage 
source.... any thoughts here?
	One More Important Question:  Since "Ignorance is Bliss", and Professor 
Campbell says that one must "Follow One's Bliss", does this mean that one must 
then pursue ignorance???     
Thanks, Warren, '81 SC.
