MTJ originally asked about the difference between the  '76 Euro Carrera
3.0 and the '78-'83 911SC 3.0 engine.
WSC responded that the 3.0 SC crankcase unit was based on the Turbo
engine.
This is correct, with the proviso that the Turbo in question was the Turbo
3.3 of '78 and '79.  This crankcase featured larger main and rod bearing
diameters, as well as other changes making it considerably more robust
than the Turbo 3.0.
The '76 Euro Carrera 3.0 engine also shared a crankcase design with a 
Turbo, but it was the '76-'77 Turbo 3.0.  It might be more accurate to say
that the both Turbo 3.0 and the Carrera 3.0 engines were based on the
RS 3.0 engine of '74.
The reputation for reliability and longevity that the 3.0 SC engines enjoy
can I believe be at least partly credited to the good fortune of using a
crankcase assembly designed for a larger displacement turbocharged
engine with 100+ more hp.
Why is the Carrera 3.0 regarded as more 'desireable' that an SC?  A
good part of it probably has to do with rarity.  Over 57,000 SCs were
produced, versus 3,700 Carrera 3.0s.  Measured performance (Euro
Carrera 3.0 to Euro SC) was almost identical.
