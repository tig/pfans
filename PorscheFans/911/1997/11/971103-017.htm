Not sure about your questions but thought of this while reading your
message...since you have access to a computer, try printing out a one page sign
that says something like "Valet Driver...do NOT touch the accelerator while
starting or you will flood the engine!" and taping it to your dash with scotch
tape when you step out and hand the keys over.  I don't think there is anything
you can do to keep this from happening, except stopping the problem at the
source.
