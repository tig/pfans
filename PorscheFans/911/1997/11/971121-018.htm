HP is a function of air MASS not pressure. Mass is directly 
proportional to pressure and inversely proportional to temperature. 
An ideal turbo would increase the pressure without adding any heat 
(Boyles law says the temp will increase proportionally to the 
pressure increase - but no additional heat is added). Unfortunately, 
the ideal turbo does not exist. All turbos add heat. The more heat 
they add, the less mass of air you will get at a fixed pressure. The 
replacement turbos increase the HP becuase they have a greater 
volumetric efficiency than the stock turbo. They add less heat so the 
compressed intake charge is more dense (more mass) and can burn more 
fuel, producing more torque. The downside is that these turbos 
are usually larger which means that they spool more slowly (more 
turbo lag). Consequently, the low RPM end of the torque curve suffers 
so the high end can be improved. Depending on your application, this 
may or may not be acceptable.

Ultimately, you're thinking along the right lines - there ain't no 
such thing as a free lunch. Higher peak HP does NOT automatically 
mean better overall performance.
