Jim,

Had the same problem with my '86 targa, turns out that the left and right
vents are each controlled by their own auxiliary fans, which are located in
the outside corners of the footwells.  Each of these fans (or at least the
driver's side) has its own fuse located next to the fan and behind the
carpeted panel in the footwell.  This fuse was blown on my car, and its
replacement had me defrosting equally well on both driver's and passenger's
side.  Of course (as is usually the case with any repair), there is a trick
here.  The fuse was not of the "normal" clay and metal VW Beetle variety.
 Instead, this fuse was of the "american and japanese car" variety -- i.e.
it was one of those plastic fuses with the two prongs pointing down.  I
don't remember off of the top of my head what its rating was.
hope this helps,
Darrin
