Hi,
I subscribed as macafee@taec.com but the bounced me
Hi PorcshePhans,
I have a stock 74 911 which I have owned for about one year.
It is my daily driver. It has had problems with overheating.
It does not have an auxillary oil cooler. At Bruce Anderson's suggestion
I removed and tested the engine oil thermostat. It was stuck closed at 212F
in boiling water. I tested the new engine oil thermostat before I put it in.
It was good. I test drove the car for 90 minutes which is about twice my
normal commute. I thought the problem was solved. The temperature didn't
go above 220F. I week later in traffic it was back up to 250F.
It doesn't overheat while the car is moving but if it is warmed up (210F)
and it sits idling for ten minutes the tempurature goes to 250F.
The air tempurature was less than 70F.
Is this normal for a stock 74 911 regular (not S or Carerra)?
I have the 11 blade fan. The fan belt is tight.
Could It have the wrong size pulley?
Can the engine oil cooler be removed with the engine in the car?
The oil pressure reads about right (a little over 60PSI at 5500RPM at 176F).
It should be 56PSI.

Regards,
Dave
