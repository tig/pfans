I need an airpump for the collapsible spare tire for my 911.  I remember
seeing a posting about that a few months ago but since the achives don't have
search capability....   Anyway, I remember that the message said the
replacement cost for the airpump was around $50 but when I called a dealer
they said that the item is $91!  I would rather save the $40 and put it
towards a Momo sport steering wheel, which leads to my next question.  
Is there a better source for steering wheels than Automotion.  I remember
another post stating  where I can buy one for about $150 with the hub
adapter.  Can the person in question please repost the message?  
Lastly, where can I find a new fuel cap for my car.  The dealer wants about
$30 for a new one.  The twist on cap that is on there now refuses to lock
down properly; I attribute the unlocked cap for a somewhat lousy gas mileage
since the gas tank is pressurized?!  Any thoughts?
