I just wanted to add to what has already been said about updating your
chain tensioners.My experience was somewhat fortunate when I think back
on it. I was in traffic doing 25 mph when the engine died. I never heard
any sound whatsoever. Naturally I triedto restart it and immediately
felt and heard a "whump" and that was enough for me. Upon removing the
valve covers I discovered there were three broken rockers(they are cast
material and probably supposed to do what they did). My mechanic dropped
the engine pulled the head and found that there was no further damage to
the valves,pistons,etc. We found that the plastic guide ramps had broken
and probably caused the chain to skip and break the rockers. All of this
would have been multiplied by whatever RPM I might have been at the time
..The timing was right for me to do the upper end,so along with the chain
tensioner update we had the valves done and the clutch replaced and it
is a joy to drive,like new to me. I know this made a believer out of me
hope this helps anybody who thinks it will never happen to
