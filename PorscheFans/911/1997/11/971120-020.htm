Hi guys! on the continuing issue about my fuel pump ( I have a 77 911s
2.7 L). I wrote in earlier about my fuel pump cutting out
intermittently. Thanks for your responses. I traced the problem to the
fuel pump relay so I replaced it only to find that in order for the
relay to work , I had to cut off the number 86 pin on the relay. My
question is: is there something about the year or engine that other
porsche owners found they had to do the same thing? The pin is down
stream from a diode inside the relay. Before the connection it had juice
flowing one way only. Now there is no juice going to pim 86. I am the
second owner and saw that the original relay had its 86 pin cut off. 

PS It still cuts out but less frequently. I'll be tracing the wires all
along the way to the pump, looking for frayed or loose connections.
