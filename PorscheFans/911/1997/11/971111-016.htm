Bob:

I used the 2-part epoxy from Home Depot ($30/gln).  I did it about 2 years
ago.  It goes on easy with a long roller.  Took about 2 hours for a 2 car
garage.  If you have cracks, you should fill them first and use a cleaner
to get rid of stains.   As in anything requiring painting, preparation is where
you spend most of the time.   I just used soapy water and broom and hosed
it down.   Hot tires will lift it - I have 8 spots where the tires 
started lifting it.
I only did 1 coat using 1 gallon.  2 coats was recommended and it looks
like I need to do it again.    There is a curing time before you can 
park on it,
like 48 hours, check the label.  There are extra steps you can do like sanding
and sealing etc but I didn't go that far.  EC did a article a while 
back on this.

Definitely worth it, no more dust in the garage, gives your garage that
showroom look plus makes it easy to wipe up spilled fluids w/o it
soaking in.  I used a light gray epoxy which reflects light well.  With 
a couple of
8-ft fluorescents, it makes the garage a friendlier place to work.

(p.s. can't respond directly, my mailer shows '911-Return' as the sender,
am I only one with this problem? No, I am not sending attachments for
those of you using Eudora.)
