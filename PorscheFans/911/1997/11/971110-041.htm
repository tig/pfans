I don't know who to send this message to, so perhaps you could forward it to
the correct party. Thanks in advance. 

My name is Rich Brown, I'm a member of the Delaware Region. I just got my
copy of Panorama today. I settled down to do some serious reading pleasure
and I realized how difficult a time I was having reading the SMALL PRINT
throughout the magazine. It had been somewhat of an irritant before, but
today-for some reason-I found myself squinting to read the ads and the
articles. In way of explanation, perhaps the fact I was 60 years old last
saturday and have "old eyes" may be a cause. I realize the size of your mag
may restrict your print type size, but I, for one would like to complain
about the size type and request your consideration in increasing it.
It's a great mag, and I'd really like to be able to clearly read it.
