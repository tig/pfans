    Alex:

    After sixteen years and 75K miles, your shocks are worn out...
    You only THINK that your car handles fine because the
    degredation has been gradual and you've gotten used to it; you
    won't notice how bad your car's handling has become until you
    install new shocks and are amazed at the difference they make.

    By the way, lack of nosedive and lack of excessive body roll
    don't mean anything... Since those behaviors are controlled by
    the springs, sway bars, and suspension geometry, it's possible
    to remove the shocks ENTIRELY and still have a car that neither
    dives nor rolls.

    A car with worn shock absorbers will:

    1) tend to hop and chatter over small bumps,
    2) possibly oscillate like a big old Plymouth after large bumps,
    3) feel soft and unresponsive overall, or
    4) feel as though it's continually shifting its weight from side
       to side or front to back without ever getting settled.

    You can replace your shocks with any brand you like... But you
    may need to buy an adapter kit if you switch brands, since the
    various shocks and struts aren't all physically the same size.
