Can anyone help identify maker of Wood Steering Wheel, came off a
Porsche and appears to be no more than maybe five years old. It is
highly polished with three broad spokes and has Made in Italy stamped on
it. It seems unique in that it has only five bolts to mount it to the
boss, where every other I have seen has six. Also the horn push is a
very small fitting about 1" in dia.
I need to find a boss and mounting kit can anyone help with possible
supplier?
