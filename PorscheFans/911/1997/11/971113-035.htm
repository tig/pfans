Hi Walter-	
	I saw your post on the transmission's various gear arrangements vis-a-vis 
relative strength of first gear, etc. Interesting, I had never thought much 
about that... 
	I have an '81 SC, all stock, and was wondering when the change was made from 
the 901 to the 915 tranny. I am guessing that the 915 is the five speed maybe, 
or are there 4 speed 915's? Which gearbox does my buggy have, I figure it must 
be the 915, as I do have the 3 liter? I am embarrassed to say I have no idea. 
Can tell you it is a five speed. 
	Are there weaknesses in my tranny I should know about? A buddy had his SC get 
stuck in reverse, it seems a notch on the reverse shaft sheered, and the shift 
fork could then not move reverse gear out of mesh ( I think that is what he 
said, anyway). Maybe he should have just driven her around in reverse, think 
how streamlined a 911 is from that end....but would be kinda slow I guess, 
haha. 
	My car still has the original clutch, being something of a pampered low 
mileage garage queen (44K). I have heard of troubles with the rubber center 
clutches, can you clarify this at all? Figure I will be needing a clutch soon, 
after only sixteen years...   
	By the way, I was out in Boulder in '95. Lovely area, hope to come back again 
someday. Wished I had my 911 there instead of the rent a car. Must be cold 
there now, tho'... I live in FL, shiverin' at the thought, Haha.      Thanks, 
Warren.
