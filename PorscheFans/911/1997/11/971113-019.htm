Jeroen,

I certainly did not intend to slap you in the face. I was just relaying
the facts as I knew them.

I seem to remember reading that the Horse is the Porsche badge is the
symbol of Stuttgart. Considering the horse and the word "Stuttgart" are in
a separate badge this would seem to make sense.

Here is some text from Compton's Living Encyclopedia to support this:

    There is evidence indicating that there probably was some
    prehistoric settlement from the Stone Age near the present
    city. A Roman fort stood in the area of Bad Canstatt in
    about AD 90. Stuttgart originated as a center for horse
    breeding in about AD 950. The name of the original horse
    farm was Stuotgarten.

From Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia:

    Stuttgart's name is derived from its origins as a
    10th-century stud farm (German: Stuotgarten) that expanded
    and became the property of the  Wurttemberg family in the
    early 13th century.
