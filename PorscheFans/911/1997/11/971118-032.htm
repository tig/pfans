This would scare me to death, if you are really referring to the pressure 
gauge, but I think you are talking about the oil LEVEL gauge, which
measures the top 3 quarts of a nominal 12 quart system.   Look at your
owner's manual, learn how to deal with oil levels.  VERY important.

>3.5 the whole trip. 

Druck is the German word for pressure - OIL pressure.    The rule of 
thumb is at least ONE bar of pressure for each THOUSAND rpm.   If
you were showing 3.5 bar at 5000 rpm, I would be worried.

Not that I know of.   If you are seeing one, you might be seeing the
glove compartment light or something.

Tire balance, shocks, ball joints.

If it does not have them, get them YESTERDAY.   All other tensioners
are a TIME BOMB which will cost you a complete engine rebuild if they
fail.   If yours are the originals, they are WAY overdue.

>

Don't know.   Get an owners manual.

>

>(the tranny is new). Should I do the previous anyway to preserve it or
>is it OK to just shift it normally as long as it lasts ? 

911 synchronizers are not Porsche's best work.   Learn to double clutch
for downshifting, and just do it as a habit.   The transmission will last far
longer than if you don't.

>under/at 2000 rpm. More like 2500/3000. Fine, but do you damage it at

You won't damage anything.    The older carburetted cars, running on leaded
fuel had a plug fouling problem.   SCs have no such problem.

>unlegible). Trouble ? 

Blower motors regularly fail.   Injectors must not leak, in order to hold system
pressure and prevent vapor lock when the engine is turned off and will be 
restarted when hot.

Wonderful.
