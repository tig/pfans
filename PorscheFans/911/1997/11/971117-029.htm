Neil - 

You say you hear noise from rear of car, and can move one drive axle a
half inch side to side, while other won't do this.

I am dubious about being able to differentiate which CV is past its wear
limit short of taking them all apart (although in your case I would start
with the axle which you can't move in and out - the axle should move
without too much force unless maybe Cvs are brand new).  My rule of
thumb, based on only one instance of noise from each source, you
should know, is that rear noises in our cars are mainly caused by Cvs or
by rear axle bearings.  The bearing (assuming only one is bad) makes
noises when turning the opposite direction at reasonably high loading
(under acceleration), or at least did so in my case.  The CV makes noise
when turning either direction.  At least, I think that is how things start out.
 
You may be able to tell if a rear bearing is going by feel:  jack up wheel
and see if there is any play.  There should be no play at all in a 911 rear
wheel, I think.  If the big nut is tight, it may be bearing replacement time. 

Also, if one CV is bad, rest may be also.  That has been my experience
where they were all original, or all replaced at one time (as long as the
boots were all OK).  However, I replaced one axle bearing 8 or 9 years
ago, other one still fine.  Reaching back into memory, I think the CV
noises in my VW bus were more like klunks, while I wouldn't describe the
sound from the 911's rear axle bearing that way.

You probably do not want even to think about that other possible source
of noise - the transmission.  But if the other sources are eliminated, you
may have to.   Plus if what you have is a random klunk, sure, lots of
things can cause that.  Bad swaybar mounts, for instance. 

So, bite the bullet and join the club of those who have spent a truely
enjoyable and rewarding weekend removing, cleaning, inspecting,
reassembling, repacking, and reinstalling CV joints.  Even if nothing is
wrong with them they probably could do with fresh grease.

You can find some good descriptions of CV removal/cleaning on the
Internet.  Try Nordstern's PCA site tech topics for doing this on a 944,
copying something from Northern New Jersey?  Same as on a 911.
