Ok, you can only use the 912 in vain so long..

Thank you for making my point! The 912 and the 911 were targeted at
differents markets, just like the 986 and the 996. In this case they
copied the whole damn exterior. The 912, like the 986, has less gauges
and a lower level of trim in the interior as compared to the upscale car
in the 911 line.

First, they didn't copy anything, they are the same car with a different
motor.
Second, ALL of the trim options, interior and exterior, were available to
all models.
(yes S trim and suspension options as well)

Heck, I would say in overall performance, the 986 is closer to the 996
than the 912 was to the 911.

Ok Scott, are you comparing the 912 to a 911S?  Why not compare it to a
911T?  Any stock 912 will whip a 911T on a good country road.  Actually,
the 911S would have a great deal of trouble as well.  Compare the 986 to
the Twin Turbo.

New and different is always bad when it comes to icons like the 911 or the
356 in her day. As I have said before, 5 years from now this will be
something we will look back on and wonder what the big stink was.

I agree with the whole thread but just couldn't let the 912 stuff go!
