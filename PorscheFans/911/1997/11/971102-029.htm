On several occasions in the past six months, the engine in my 89 Carrera
has shut off abruptly.  It seems as though I've turned off the ignition
switch, but I can't tell if the problem is electrical or fuel-related. 
It has happened at various speeds:  at a steady 65 mph on the freeway in
5th gear,  at a steady  45 mph in 3rd, and a couple of times at idle
while stuck in traffic.   If I try immediately to re-start the engine,
it turns over OK but won't fire at all.  If I wait maybe 10-30 seconds,
eventually it'll start up.  Also, a couple of times it wouldn't start in
the morning on the first try; if I waited 10-20 seconds and then tried
to start it again, it would fire up ok. 

I don't mind living with some idiosyncracies in my cars, but this one is
plain unsafe.  Most recently, it happened last night on my way home from
Bruce Anderson's and Jerry Woods' 911 maintenance course near San Jose
(a good course and well worth the $)...in the dark, in the fast lane,
and in heavy traffic.  

I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has dealt with this before. 
Thanks!
