May I politely suggest that the use of attachments is not a lot of fun on the 
Pfans List? At least not for me, anyway! My computer locked up when I tried to 
open the 911 digest for 23 November. Had to ctrl-alt-delete out of my email 
program. Obviously I did finally get it to work, after 2 more tries. While 
trying to open it, I sat muttering and watching the little hourglass thing 
rotate for about two minutes. I don't see that hourglass a whole lot anymore 
since I now have a fairly quick pentium 166. 
I have never had my email program (Microsoft Exchange, came with W95) do that 
(lock up) before, but it does not seem to like attachments a whole lot I have 
noticed. Suggestion: If one has a file to attach, such as a photo of a car for 
sale or a parts list, perhaps he could just announce that fact and give an 
email address. Then interested parties could send in a request for the file... 
Just my 2 cents worth. Maybe I am the only person who feels this way? Or maybe 
MSoft Exchange is just a lame Email program, haha.....W.
