Thanks, Bill for the tip--
I have been wanting to get  a numerical oi temp guage myself for years, but 
was told some time ago that it was a pain in the neck, so have never done so. 
Never realized this change is so easy and affordable. I will look into this 
again. 
In fact, I was also told that it would upset me to see the real oil temps in 
my treasured flat six. It seems that is why Porsche went to the non-numbered 
guage in the first place, my mechanic said.... Apparently oil temps rose each 
year as emissions controls were added, and owners of SC's who had traded older 
cars, which seem to have run cooler, were complaining about high oil temps in 
their shiny new buggies. So Porsche decided to keep us in the dark to shut us 
up...."Vat zey do not know vill not hurt zem." ;-)
 I also have an '81 SC Coupe, love it... Warren.
