> Sounds like the carbs are too rich.  You say the idle is o.k., so we
> know the idle circuit is working.  Question: does your problem occur
> only when you quickly press the accel. pedal or when you gradually
> press it, or both?  The reason I ask is because the carbs have two
> separate circuits that operate under acceleration.  The progression
> circuit is a series of small holes in the throat just above the
> throttle plate, which "progressively" deliver more fuel when you go
> from idle to running conditions.  Under hard acceleration, the accel.
> pump enriches the mixture with an extra "squirt" of fuel.  This is why
> I ask the question above, so I have an idea of what circuit may be
> malfunctioning.
> 
> Another possibility is that the fuel float is stuck or something is
> otherwise causing the fuel level in the float chamber to be too high.
> Have you looked down the carbs throats when the car is running?  If
> the level is too high, you would see fuel running into the throats.
> 
> Just some ideas, but my guess is that the carbs are too rich.  After
> checking it out again, if you need some help, you can contact me
> directly at goslund@ch2m.com.  Good Luck, Greg.
