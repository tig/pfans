Hi Eric,
I have been restoring a 69 targa which was in similar condition as your
description. I purchased the car in San Diego as a project because it was
the most rust free one I could find at the time. There was a bit of rust
starting to peak out from the rear deck at the fold seam and the
undercoating was flaking away from the inside of the rear wheel wells and
the bottom of the floor pan. Another place to check is under the floor
carpets, particularly in the targa, because of the targas tendency to leak.
I do not know how much galvanizing is on your car but my 69 has zilch. I
sought a price quote from a recommended stripper. To do only the chassis
without doors, lids or front fenders $600. They suggested using a plastic
media to remove the paint and a more aggressive media on rust if necessary.
When I told them about the PVC undercoating, they suggested that be left in
place where it was not removed easily. This seemed plausible, however, I
decided to try an experiment. I selected a couple areas of the underchassis
and removed the PVC. Some of it flaked off in sizable chunks but most of it
adhered well. Curiosity got the best of me, so armed with a sharp chisel, I
removed some of the adherent PVC. To my surprise there was traces of surface
rust even under the "good" PVC, DAMN! Checking the restoration guide, the
recommended procedure is to mechanically remove the PVC. This I have done,
and found rust in areas I didn't expect. The greater share of the rust was
very superficial and did not cause visible pitting. The only rusted through
area was the top of the rear wheel wells. These areas were cut out and
replaced with metal by a local body man who specializes in rust repair for
$300. Once the dreaded PVC was removed, the media blasting was much easier.
I have tried to blast the PVC but the metal seems to erode significantly
with the PVC. The chassis has cleaned up well and I am surprised that it
hadn't rusted more, after all, it is a 29 year old car. If you would like
more info e-mail me.
