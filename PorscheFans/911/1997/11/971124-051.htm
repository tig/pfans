Len:

Before you get all smug about your high-speed internet access, you
should realize that download time isn't the only problem with
attachments... There are a number of others:

    1.  Some people (especially in countries outside the USA) pay for
    internet access by the byte, or at least by the minute. When you
    send them hundreds of kilobytes of binary attachments, you're
    costing them money.

    2.  People who receive the "digest" form of the list can't decode
    attachments without going to a whole lot of trouble, and
    many of the others can't decode attachments even if they receive
    Porschefans messages one at a time.

    3.  There are still a number of ISPs (notably, the free "Juno"
    e-mail service) that limit the size of incoming mail messages to
    32K or so.  If a Juno user gets the list in "digest" form, he
    won't be able to download a digest that contains large binary
    attachments, so he'll miss out on ALL of thaat day's Porschefans
    traffic.

    4.  The Porschefans list is archived on the web.  If binary
    attachments aren't filtered out by the archiving software, they
    take up valuable space there.

    5.  There are something like 1500 subscribers to the 911 list
    alone.  Even if a HUNDRED of them want to see the pictures, that
    means that over 90% of us DON'T want to.

    6.  It's inconsiderate to force the listserver to mail out 150
    megabytes of data (100K of images * 1500 subscribers),
    especially since the recipients are overwhelmingly NOT
    interested in it.

The best way to distribute binary files is to put them up on a web
page or ftp site somewhere, then just post a short message to the
list which describes the files and their location.
