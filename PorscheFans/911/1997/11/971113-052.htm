Hi Warren.  I have to admit that I have no experience with the braided =
lines, and I was just repeating what I had often been told.

I guess early on these lines were for racing only, and not DOT approved =
for road use.  They required frequent careful inspection and could fail =
if not installed correctly (I think you have to be real careful not to =
twist them). Sometimes the braiding could chafe the Teflon, eventually =
causing failure.  Neither issue was a problem for a race car, where the =
lines would probably get replaced often, and likely installed by a pro.

I think DOT braided lines are available now.  Still, I found new rubber =
lines to be absolutely firm.  A highly regarded local shop (Natick, MA) =
even uses rubber on their race car, not trusting the braided.  One less =
thing to worry about.  Good enough for me.

There are probably thousands of people using braided lines without =
problems, so you probably shouldn't worry about yours.  I just didn't =
see them worth the trouble, and I have no regrets staying with the =
rubber.

Hope this helps!

Mark
