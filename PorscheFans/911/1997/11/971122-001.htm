Hi Warren

Regarding that gamble you are taking, I replaced my tensioners in
September last year.  I got those symptoms of a rattling noise you
mentioned just prior to that.  

I was livin up in the hills surrounding Adelaide, South Australia at the
time and I remember being on my way to Parafield Airport and going down
the hills the back way from Stirling, down Greenhill Road which is a
marvellous and windy road with PANORAMIC views. It's hard to keep all
your attention on driving with such magnificent views right in front of
you.

Every now and then as I came into a tight corner I decelerated and THAT
NOISE happened. I though my turbo tail was loose.  When I got to the
bottom I pulled over, lifted the tail and felt round for anything loose
but everything was OK.

The noise does come when the revs are low, i.e. almost no pressure on
those chains.  By the way there are 2 of them in the 3.0 litre, one on
the left and one on the right.

I paid the approx $AUD1,000 to have the tensioners replaced with new
ones.  The tensioners were around $AUD290 each (total $AUD580) and
labour filled in the rest at $55 per hour.  Since I had just bought the
car I took it back to the selling dealer who said he'd do a repair on
the tensioners.  There is a tensioner repair kit but it just consists of
a rubber seal (the fold-over-the-end type), a spring and a few washers I
think.  They cost about $AUD90 each. Don't waste your time repairing the
original tensioners.  Get new ones.  If you repair the old ones you get
reconditioned old ones whereas new ones are much better.  The repair job
took 2 days (elapse time) and I became unhappy with the job within 12
hours of getting the car back.  So I paid to get the job done properly
by the Porsche dealer Chateau Moteur.  The service manager summed it up
nicely for me "You may have paid for it but that part of your car is now
as good a new one"  There's a certain amount of sense in that.  Since
the new 911s are excellent as well, I thought that sounded OK.  I don't
ever expect to have to go back in to that part of the engine again and
it's worth a thousand to rely on that.  But if you're paying $US1,000 in
the US then that's too many US dollars.  I would have thought around
$150 for the tensioners (tot $300) and about $400 labour making around
$700 max in total. Bargain if you ask me.
