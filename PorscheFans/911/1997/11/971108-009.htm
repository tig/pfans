You've hit upon something I've run into for years. Fiberglass fabricators
all seem to me to be mildly addled. The folks who make great glass one day
make horrible, ill-fitting parts the next. It may be something about
constantly breathing the resin fumes.

Also, I've found that the actual fabricator of the part is often not the
''front man' selling it. Much fiberglass work seems to be done cottage
industry style in suburban garages, with the name companies buying the
products.

For that reason, I don't know if any supplier is consistently better than
any other. If you're into a precise copy of the GT2 wing in carbon fiber,
the best I've seen is an M.A. Shaw part. (714) 730-6917

I've bought a couple of parts from him in the past two years, and found
them to be well made...
