A friend of mine who also drives his C4 in winter called and stumped 
me. He claims that when he accelerates on icy surfaces from rest, the 
car kicks out to one side.

What he expected was for the car to track straight ahead perhaps 
slipping a little sideways (torque effects) while spinning all 4 
wheels.

He called his dealer and asked about the torque/power split. Porsche 
says 45 percent power transfers to the frnt wheels. Not what he saw 
though. He gets the dealer to call PCNA in Reno, there he is told 
"max 15 percent, actually we shouldn't call them 4WD"!!!!

The car has ABD and limited slip.  Does anyone (like Bruce) know what 
the real scoop is?
