Morning folks, 

Yeah, it's me again... Sorry, my question phase is almost over...
Like I said (and you recommended), I went to have the tires balanced to
see if that cured my steering vibration... Nope.  The tire guy added a
little weight on one wheel but said it was so little it shouldn't make
any difference... He was right !  Still vibrates...

On a side note, I thought it was happening like clockwork between 72 and
78 mph, it's not... if I accelerate thru that range, I hardly feel it,
but letting go of the accelerator, the vibe comes and stays (in that
range)... I am confused. You guys mentioned the wheel bearings as a
possible cause also ? Can I check for something there ?  What do those
go for anyway ?

My front end is so low that the car had to be hand lifted to fit on the
jacks at the tire shop. That's ridiculous, I gotta take it back to
stocks height... Maybe that will help cure the problem too..

Any idea of the cost on that before I call  the local porsche dealer ?
What's involved, new shocks only ? 
Also, on something as crucial as front end geometry/suspension, should I
go to my trusty mechanic (as in engine guy) or is it better to rely on
the porsche dealership for stock settings ?  

Thanks again to all !

PS: 250 miles of sheer pleasure this week end, minus a couple of
sidewalks and other "crrrrr" because this car it way too low !!!  ;-(
