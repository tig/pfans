Scott, this sounds like the same problem that I had.  The fuel system
included a plastic expansion box (about 4-5 inches square) that is
behind your speedometer.  Mine had cracked and gas fumes leaked into the
car; especially when the tank was full.  Its a pain to get to it, but it
can be reached from your front trunk and it is help up top by a fancy
rubber band.  By the way, during the year it took me to find a
replacement, I pulled the two hoses off the damaged box and plugged
them.  There were no problems for over a year running "plugged".

Thanks,
