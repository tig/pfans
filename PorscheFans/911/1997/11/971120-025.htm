Just an update about the B&B tri-flo system that I have on my '79 930. 
The system was installed last June, sound is not much different than the
stock exhaust except when the turbo has reach top boost (the dump tube
is a litte noisy).  I have the standard B&B muffler, not the sport.  At
idle the car seems to have a deeper sound and it has occasionally set
some car alarms off as I drive through parking lots.  Oops.  Also, I've
notice during night driving a bright orange light from behind the car
when up-shifting while the turbo is on.  Bring on the marshmallows!  
I'm told its an interesting show behind the car.  I don't know if this
is characteristic of all 930s with the B&B system or if the car is just
running a little too rich.  Overall, the car seems to have more torque
in the lower RPMs and seems to rev better.  No dyno data.

I do have a question for the all knowning thermal experts on the list. 
First, it seems that the muffler gets very hot and that heat is
transfered to the rear bumper.  I'm concerned that this will eventually
burn or discolor the paint.  To solve this there are coating systems
which will keep the heat from radiating from the stainless steel into
the bumper.  Coatings offered by "Jet Hot" seem like they would keep the
heat off the rear bumper. But if you coat the exhaust system with
something that prevents heat from radiating, what happens to the engine,
heads, and exhaust ports?  Will they run hotter because the exhaust is
no longer acting as a heat sink?  Has anyone tried coating their exhaust
to reduce heat in the engine compartment?
