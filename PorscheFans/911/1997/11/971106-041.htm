Just to add my two cents on this...

I had a 77 911S that did this same thing, and it was very frustrating.

Eventually, I got to looking inside the distributor and found the
problem was with the plates that the points sit on. It has been over 10
years and I don't remember exactly but something was broken under them
that was allowing them to vibrate around causing the engine to die from
time to time. Seems it would only happen when I let off the gas to coast
to a stop. Anyway, I bought a new 2.7 Euro Distributor from Porsche Mail
Order, before they changed to PMO, and my problem was solved.
