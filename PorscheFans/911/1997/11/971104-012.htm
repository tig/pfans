Troy - You ask if you should purchase a strut bar for your 79 930.  

A while back before I thought I could approach this business analyitically,
I dutifully bought a strut bar for my car (stable energies), then read
Automotion's hype (backed up, they said, with teltale dial gauges, which
sounded like a good way of testing things) when they came out with
theirs (theory A - strut pushes one way.  theory B, strut pulls the other
way.) and bought one of theirs.  Of course, no scientific testing by me of
car handling with or without.  Word in the pits was that you saw
improvement in stability in really high speed turns with a strut bar, which
is somewhat hard to test, although I suppose once you had the thing for
a while you might try removing it for one run session at a track with a
high speed corner just to see if you could notice anything (how high on
anyone's priority list is this apt to be?).  Later I began to wonder if
camber change under hard cornering wasn't due more to compliance of
the rubber in the stock strut mount, which the Automotion system seems
to restrict (ads for camberballs suggest this, anyway, while saying
inferentially the Weltmeister scheme does this badly, though that part
may be at least partly hype, as I have never noticed any bad effect from
my Weltmeister bar).   And now you can even get carbon fiber strut
bars. 

Even later, when Bruce A brought out his revised book, I noticed he said
these bars did no good at all on torsion bar front ends, but were useful
for coilover cars.  Presumeably this has something to do with the
geometry:  the spindle is a whole lot closer to the strong lower A arm
than to the top strut insert mount, so the side forces are going to be
divided inversely in that ratio more or less, and it has to be hard to
transfer all that much force to the top, which is why the skinny little
shock rod can handle it in the first place, maybe?

If you can generate one G of side force in a 3200 lb car, you might
approximate the force at each wheel as 800 pounds which has to be
transfered from the chassis to the tires and available to distort the
chassis at each corner (yes, rear is heavier, outside tire loaded more
heavily, etc).  If the spindle is one quarter of the way up the strut (just
guessing) and my understanding of leverage or the distribution of loads
on a beam is not too far off, you might see 200 pounds of side force at
the top, and 600 at the bottom? 

200 pounds doesn't seem like all that much for that sheet metal to take. 
Imagine car on its side with someone of that size standing on the shock
tower.  

On the other hand, I think a rule of thumb for design of suspension loads
may be something like 3G?  Which for our car with coilovers would be
2400 lbs a simplified corner going over quite a bump? (this gets even
more unrealistic for our rear engined cars, but you get the drift).  This
sounds like a force which could move things around, although even then
not too much of it looks like it is directed sideways, which is the only
direction strut bars of any stripe which are not criscrossed and welded
in would seem to affect much.

Maybe Bruce A will enlighten us on his thinking on these bars.  I
am not planning to take mine off, but then I've long ago spent the money
on it.  I just wonder where in the priorities of suspension upgrading it
should be.

I wonder if bushing upgrades would pay greater dividends.

Kettering's dictum - parts left off cost nothing and need no maintenance)
