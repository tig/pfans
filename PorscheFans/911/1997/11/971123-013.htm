Greetings P-nuts!
Geeez, I hope i don't start sounding like "guido - the used car
salesman..." but I've got yet ANOTHER Targa here that needs a new home.
This one is a '74 with the dreaded 2.7 ltr engine, with 91k orig miles on
it.  I would not reccomend this car car to a "newbie" or "first timer"
simply due to this engine's reputation...having said that, I think this
thing would a make a nice daily driver/project-track or project-resto car
for some one who truely understands the 2.7 model 911.  BTW, the engines
does NOT have upgraded tensioners on it.

OK...here are some particulars
- Older re-paint: from bright yellow to dark brown.  the original paint job
was very good, but is showing it's age
- Targa top needs re-building
- fresh shocks on front, so-so shocks on rear
- Good brakes, new master cylinder
- Good runner, good compression, no burning oil
- Does have the "standard" oil leaks
- very straight, no accidents
- very nice fuch alloys on it
- Medium tan interior color
- factory air setup (I think I'd be inclined to tear all that out -- needs
charging at any rate)
- Driver's seat pretty beat, either replace it or re-do it
- passenger seat ok - couple of little tears
- cheap seatcovers on both seats anyway
- original interior carpet is in amazingly good condition - I was pretty
impressed with that
- Glass is in great shape; front, rear and sides
- Car is located Ridgecrest, CA (3.5 hours northeast of Los Angeles)
- I made a short video (VHS) of this car

$7500 or best offer --  The Anxious Owner would like to move it before
Christmas if possible

I'm sure I've overlooked some details, so, if interested give me a
call...and thanks for all this bandwidth

Cheers - and happy holidays
