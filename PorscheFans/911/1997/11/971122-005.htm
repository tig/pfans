Greg,

I have updated some of web pages to include photos of the local Zone7 PCA
players.  See http://www.wenet.net/~seppi/z7players.html

If you plan to get serious and autocross and/or TT, you should pick up a
copy of Hank Watts' book, Secrets of SOLO RACING.  Frey Racing in Mt View 
or Automotion in Sunnyvale will have copies.

Be careful about doing stuff like that in a parking lot. Probably safe
but the POLICE don't care for it and will give you a pretty bad time.

I would recommend learning this stuff at an autox instead.  The SCCA SFR
has events during the next three weekends.  Maybe only a few Porsches at
these events, but still fun.  

	Sat Nov 29	Stockton
	Sun Dec 7	Oakland
	Sun Dec 14	Mather

I hope to make it to Mather.  See http://www.sfrscca.com/solo2/index.html
for details.

Good luck and have fun,
