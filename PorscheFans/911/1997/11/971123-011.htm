Hi Pans,
Concerning torsion bars Ron asked "Do torsion bars wear out?"

I'm having trouble connecting to AOL so I,m a little late in throwing in my
$0.02 but here it goes anyway. 

The torsion bar is a shaft that carries a static load and cyclic load. The
steady load is that portion of the cars weight that the individual bar
carries with car at rest ( 1-g load). The cyclic load comes from a car in
motion car going over irregularities in the road, landing after leaving the
ground with any individual or all wheels and from wheels that are not
perfectly balanced. These loads combine to produce the total torsional load
the bar has to carry.

The designer will size the bar such that the total load mutiplied by a factor
of safety
will result in a  maximium stress that is below the proportional limit of the
material used to make the bar. He should also take great care to avoid or
minimize any stress concentrations in his design. In the ideal world the
torsion bars would never fail or wear out, however, they do. Failures /
wearouts can be due to overloads, creep, fatigue or material over
temperature:

Overload - Applying loads that produce stress that is beyond the proportional
limit of the material would cause a permanent twist in the bar. I would think
overload failures would be very rare unless "the Fat Lady" is riding with you
or you go over real big bumps.
Material Creep - A permanent twist can develope in the bar at loads below the
proportional limit. You wouldn't necessarily be aware of this happening since
it usually take a long time to develop. The car would sag due to the
permanent twist. When you replace it depends on how much sag you can stand.
If a miracle happens, front and rear sag happens simultaneously and you don't
have to lower your car ( replace bars when the car is scraping the pavement).
Fatigue - We could debate whether going over bumps is Low Cycle Fatigue and
an unbalanced wheel is High Cycle Fatigue, but let's just lump it all under
the general title of fatigue. What happens is that after a number of  stress
cycles the metal will develop a crack that will grow in size (lenght & depth)
until the "critical crack length" is reached at which time the crack will
propagate through the cross section of the bar. Crack initiation happens
faster when a stress concentration is present. The stress concentration can
be damage that happen in use, such as a sharp nick, or be due to a
manufacturing error or a poor design. There is a period of time from crack
initiation until the crack cause the part to fail. Fracture Mechanics
adresses this portion of the total part life but I would not consider it for
torsion bars. If a bar is inspected and a crack is found either with Zygol or
visually, replace it. 
Over Temperature - Heating a torsion bar will lower the proportional limit,
yield and ultimate strength of the metal and will cause creep and / or yield
failures. Usually won't happen unless the car is REALLY on fire --- torsion
bar sag won't be your main concern at that time.

Hopes this helps.
Jack

Subject: Do torsion bars wear out?

As I look at the extracted torsion bars from the '69 911T Targa they appear
in good condition cosmetically. But the Automotion catalog says that torsion
bars can wear out...................
