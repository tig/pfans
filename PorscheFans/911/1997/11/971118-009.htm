> Mark:
> This may be an obvious trouble shooting sequence so I appologise for
> the use of band width.  BFWIW this is what I'd do.  With the engine
> warm and at idle, pull the plug wire off the plugs one at a time until
> you find the one thats missing (the RPM will drop on a wire pulled
> from a good cylinder).  When you find the one that is missing (the RPM
> didn't drop when the wire was pulled), ground a screw driver blade and
> stick the end into the plug cap boot.  When it gets close to the plug
> contact it should arch. This lets you check the ignition system, wire,
> cap et all to the plug.   If it doesn't you can swap wires from the
> distributor cap and try again checking the wire.  If it does shut the
> engine down .  I'd then disable the fuel pump which on your 79 should
> be a connector in the upper left of the engine compartment (blue /
> green I think but would have to check) but there is also a saftey
> switch that would let you hold the air plate down to keep the pump
> from running or jump the switch so the pump can't run.  The point here
> is that you want to make sure the engine won't start due to lack of
> fuel.  Your system has an accumulator so it may fire even with the
> pump off.  Let it run util it quits.  THEN pull the plug from the
> offending cylinder.  Attach the plug to its wire, ground it and check
> for spark.  Now the reason for all this is that I just spent Sunday
> morning chasing what I thought was at first was an ignition related
> miss that turned out to be the fuel distributor.  Good luck if you
> need more detail contact me directly.
