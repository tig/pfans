Hi Greg,

Congrats on your new car.  Some answers to your questions...

> The oil pressure gauge..

Actually you mean the oil level gauge.  The behavior you observe is
normal.  It really only reads coorectly, and then not always, when the car is
on level ground, warmed up, and idling.  It's more of an indicator than
anything else.  The sender is a contraption that looks and works like the
float
lever in the hopper of a toilet.  It bounces all over the place.  The
dipstick is the best gauge.

>Druck ?  Is that like instant pressure ? That was pegged at
>3.5 the whole trip.

Druck is German for pressure.  Yours is good.

>The steering wheel seems to vibrate a bit too much ...
>Could it be that plastic thing on the steering column the
>list was discussing a while back ?

Yes, it could be.  It could be lots of things--tire balance, bad rack,
loose wheel bearings, etc. It shouldn't vibrate.

>Ok, the car's got 114 K miles, purrs like a cat, what's the
>deal with hydraulic chain tensioners ? If it lived this long without
>them.... ????

Actually, I think it's correct to say that both the old and new style
tensioners
are hydraulic.  The old style uses an ingenious self-contained system, sort of
internally oil pressurized, that I've never been able to figure out, even
though I'm an engineer and even though I've rebuilt a bunch of them, and
the newer style uses oil pressure supplied by the engine's oil system.

It seems to be the (very) popular wisdom to replace the older units.  There's
no doubt that the newer style is better, but there's also no doubt that the
older style can last a very long time.  Lots of newer things are better
than older things, but that doesn't mean one automatically replaces the
latter.
For what it's worth, I've kept the older style tensioners.  One of my 911's
had
205K miles on it (I just sold it.) and my present one has 168K miles.

>I can shift straight, no double clutching, no rev matching,
>(the tranny is new). Should I do the previous anyway to preserve it or
>is it OK to just shift it normally as long as it lasts ?

It's OK to shift without double clutching or rev matching.  Synchros do it
for you.  If you help them do their job by rev matching,  for example, they'll
wear less and last longer, but I doubt we're talking about more than a
possible
few percent longer life, if that.  Personally, I wouldn't worry about it,
although I do it out of habit.

>Second gear is in my driver seat, I know what you guys were
>talking about now !

You can adjust the position of the gear lever by loosening the shift coupler
found under the access plate in the center of the rear floor.

>Lugging it ? under which rpm ?

All the cars I've ever owned, including 911's, seem to do fine above 2000 rpm,
and tend to lug below, except in 1st gear, of course.

Have fun!
