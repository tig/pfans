I don't know much about the paint cracking issue, but I would like to
add that in attaching your flares to the steel, I would consider using a
structural epoxy adhesive and "bonding" them to the car.  My SC steel
flares were done this way on my '76 911 and it worked like a charm.

Seems alot easier than riveting...

Good luck,
