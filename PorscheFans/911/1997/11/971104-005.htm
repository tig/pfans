Yousef,

I bought replacement wire-bound Loprene heater hose for ~$10-12 from
German Parts and Restoration www.GPRParts.com (800-321-5432).  They
have a $25 minimum order so I usually wait until I have a large enough order.
They frequently advertise 911 specials like $15 Bosch cap/rotor sets etc.

Someone else was asking for a source of the Pertronix unit, this is where
I got mine for $65.

No financial interest, just a very satisfied customer.
