Chris,
The steering stops are cheap (<$20 each) to buy from Porsche and
expensive to install.  I've been told the rack must be removed to
install them.  Don't know for sure.  The recommendation I've gotten from
a notable wheel shop advertising in PANO is unless you're running 225's
or larger at full lock on the track, you shouldn't need them.  I would
imagine Auto-X would also make rubbing excessive, though.  I agree, my
205's did rub on the inside but not alot.  If you really feel you need
these the Porsche part number is 3,96434732502.

To anyone on the list, I'm looking for Porsche 17" C2T wheels in the 9"
width for the back of my C4 so I can remove the 7's in the front. :-)
Anyone, know where I might find reasonable prices for these? TIA
