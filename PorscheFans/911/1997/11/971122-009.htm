Terry,
Looks like you may have been right.  I've changed all plugs and checked
each one and there's *still* a miss.  I've got a nice blue spark on each
one and the distributor looks good.  Haven't pulled an injector yet, but I
think that's going to be my next step.  When I pulled the old plugs, five
looked good, if a little experienced.  The last one (#6, of course) was
covered in black carbon deposits -- no oil though, thank God -- so I
believe I've found the culprit.  What does this type of deposit indicate?

Questions for T. and anyone else who wants to jump in:
How did you determine that it was the fuel distributor?  I assume (danger,
danger!) that I can pull the injector, stick it in a jar and look for a
nice fine mist when I turn the engine over.  If it sputters, I've got a
problem somewhere between the fuel distributor and the injector.  How do I
tell where it is and take car of the problem as inexpensively as possible?

New symptom:  If I run up the revs, it seems to clear its throat and run
cleanly for a second or two before missing again, so this may point to a
fuel problem, no?

If nothing else, I'm starting to appreciate a nice fine grease under the
fingernails....
