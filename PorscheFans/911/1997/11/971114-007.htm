> The obvious here is to change the fluid and see what happens. If you
> get metal filings I think you got your answer.  FWIW Clipping reverse
> would be more a case of shift coupling alignment or worn bushings in
> the coupler I would think but could be something else.   5th and
> reverse share a common shift rod.  What should happen is the rod for
> 5th and reverse should pull 5th out of gear putting the gear set in
> neutral.  Then the shift rod will rotate out of the engagement notch
> for 5th & reverse and swing the engagement lever for 3rd and 4th on
> the pivot fork engaging the 3rd and 4th shift rod an pulling into 4th.
> I would wonder how the upshift from 3rd to 4th is??  In my recent IRAN
> of my 915/40 I had a bent fork that played hell on the up shift to 3rd
> from 2nd but had no effect on the down shift from 3rd to 2nd.
