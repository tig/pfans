Greg, 
	Congrats on the 'new' '81SC! Sounds like a nice car. I have had my '81 SC for 
years and love it. My car has less than half the miles of yours however, so 
its oil system may read pressures a little differently from yours. But at 114K 
your motor likely has plenty of miles to go. I would recommend the chain 
tensioners upgrade.   
	It seems you may be a little confused about the Oil Guages. The Druck 
pressure is the Oil Pressure guage, and the bouncy little one on the right 
with the red zone at the bottom is the Oil Level guage. The oil level guage 
indicates the amount of oil in the outboard oil tank, which is where you check 
the oil. 
	As you know the 911 engine has a dry sump oil system, unlike most cars. That 
is to say the engine's oil reservoir is not in a pan at the bottom of the 
crankcase, but is in a tank located at the upper right of the engine 
compartment, inside the right rear fender. The oil filter is there too.
	When the car is started, it takes a little while for the oil guages to 
stabilize due to this unusual arrangement. The oil has to get moved around and 
warmed up before the guages read normally. I find on my car that the Druck 
pressure guage is quite high at startup, at about 4.5, and comes down to 
around 3, 3.5 or so later, and rises and falls with engine speed, I think 
guage reads in BAR, and should be roughly equivalent to 1 Bar per 1000 rpms. 
	The oil level guage, on the other hand is almost overly sensitive. The car 
holds 11 quarts of oil, and I find that if it is down half a quart the needle 
falls to about horizontal. I don't worry about it unless it gets down below 
horizontal when engine is warm and at idle. Then she needs a quart. Marks on 
the dipstick are for 2 quarts rather than the usual one. 911's will burn some 
oil, that is normal, but not a huge amount of oil.   
	Remember to check the oil with the engine running, warmed up, and preferably 
after driving a bit. Let it stabilize, and then take a reading. Oil dipstick 
is inside the oil tank filler tube. It is normal for the engine speed to drop 
slightly and run a little rough while checking the oil. Don't overfill. 
	By the way, it is normal for 911's to smoke a little on startup after they 
have been sitting for a while. This is due to the flat, opposed design of the 
engine. The oil pools in the cylinder and then gets burned up on starting. 
Many also drip oil.  
	The chain tensioners are indeed a good upgrade you should consider. When the 
old tensioners fail, it can do some serious damage. Another good thing to get 
is the little air box flapper valve which keeps the Fuel Injection air box, a 
$200 part, from dying when your car backfires, which it can do if the 
injection or ignition timing ever are in need of adjustment.
	My car also prefers to be driven over 2000 rpm's, but others have cars that 
will drive at 1500 or so. But I would just learn your cars idiosyncrasies and 
live with them. You will love your car, if it is anything like my '81. 
	Good Luck and Happy Porsche-ing, und Wilkommen auf der List!  Warren.
