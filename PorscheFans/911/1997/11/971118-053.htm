Hello,

I'm in the market for my first 911 and am planning to spend 
$10k-$12k.  From the ads I've seen online and in various 
publications, my price range seems to put me in the market 
for a late '70s to early '80's model.

My questions are:

Should I stay away from an '80-'82 with 100-130k miles on it if 
appears to have been well cared for (looks good, has extensive service 
recs, etc)?  How many miles can I expect an engine to last before it's 
rebuild time?

What are the common trouble spots to look for?  

Are there any good buyer's guides on the web?

In what year did 911s first have galvanized bodies?  Living in an 
area that gets some snow and where salt is used fairly extensively, 
rust is a concern.

Were there any major/particularly desireable mechanical updates that 
these cars underwent during this time period?  For example, would a 
'82 be more desirable than a '78 (ie handle much better, more hp, 
etc)?  What were the transition years and (briefly) what updates were done?

Anyone know of any good cars in my price range in NJ, Philly, or NYC 
area?  My preference is for non-targa, no whale tail, color that will 
not attract NJ's finest, well cared for early 80s car, mileage 
probably not a huge issue. Please send details/owner's name/e-mail/phone#.

Thanks,

Gary
