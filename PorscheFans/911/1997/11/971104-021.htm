For a fun car without putting a fortune into it, pick up a running 2.7L
engine that someone has discarded in favor of larger displacement.
Most of these engines have been rebuilt since very few could have
survived from the mid-'70s, so most of the major problems have been
attended to.  Also, decent, running 2.7s only seem to fetch about $2k
to $3k.  Plus the engines have good torque (something the 2.0 liter
will have to try hard to have) and have the hp you're looking for.

Swapping in a decent 2.7 will probably be cheaper than getting 160hp
out of the 2.0 liter, also.

Just a suggestion....
