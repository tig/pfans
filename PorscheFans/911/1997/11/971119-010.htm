ROLE MODELS

A few months ago, Howard Stern hosted Julie Cailini ('96 Playmate of 
the Year) and Stacey Sanchez ('97 Playmate of the Year) for a morning 
of sordid joviality.

The ladies, who were promoting their latest calendars, answered ten 
questions from Howard, ostensibly to demonstrate how important it is 
for them *AS ROLE MODELS* for young women to stay up on current 
affairs.  The ladies' answers were amusing (and a bit sad), but the bit 
did prove that you don't have to be a neurosurgeon to earn a pile of cash!

 Q: Who is the President of Russia?
 Julie:  "Gorbachev"
 Stacey: "Gretzky"
 (correct answer: Boris Yeltsin)

 Q: Define the meaning of NAACP.
 Julie:  "Something, something, for Certified Pianists"
 Stacey: "It's some kind of police organization."
 (correct answer: National Association for the Advancement of Colored People)

 Q: Who was the inventor of the lightbulb?
 Julie:  "I know Edison invented the telephone, but I can't remember 
the light bulb guy."
 Stacey: "I don't know."
 (correct answer: Thomas A. Edison. Alexander Graham Bell was the phone guy!)

 Q: Who is the Speaker of the House?
 Julie:  "Gore something-or-other."
 Stacey: "Bill Clinton."
 (correct answer: Newt Gingrich.  For the benefit of international 
members, Al "Gore" is the U.S. Vice President, "Bill Clinton" is our 
President.)

 Q: Define the meaning of the letters CIA.
 Julie:  "I don't know."
 Stacey: "Certified Investigation Association."
 (correct answer: Central Intelligence Agency)

 Q: What is the center of our solar system?
 Julie:  "The Equator"
 Stacey: "The Moon"
 (correct answer: The Sun)

 Changing his tack to create better odds for the girls, Howard switched 
to what he termed "industry related" questions:

 Q: What do the initials "DK" stand for?
 A: Both knew it was fashion designer "Donna Karan."

 Q: What is "Cristal?"
 A: Both knew it was an elite champagne

 Q: What car company has a model known as a "911?"
 A: Both knew it was Porsche.
