Hi John, here is my 0,02.

I had similar symptoms and the fault was leaking intake manifold gaskets.=

Specially cyl. #3, as the head temp sensor is there.
Do You have black smoke coming from exhaust meaning rich mixture?

Engine speed and reference-mark sensors are inductive and as far as
I know they either work or not. Of course there could be a bad connection=

that occasionally screws up the signal.

Two-wire head temp sensor??  =


What is this two-wire head temp sensor? Mine has two wires coming to =

plug, but the sensor only have one wire. As I'm pulling the engine out
to get rid of some oil leaks, it would be easy to change then. =


Should I change it to this two-wire sensor even that the old one seem to
be working fine?
