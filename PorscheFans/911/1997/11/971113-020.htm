pfans,

This is an interesting topic which I struggled with when I went
from a 2.2T to a 3.2 in my 71.

I wanted to keep the 901 for two reasons:

1.  I love the shift pattern :)

2.  and I had just spent mucho dineros rebuilding the 901

I finally ended up going to a 915 and eating the 901 (figuratively)

No mechanic I talked to wanted to preside over a 901 in a car with
225+HP.  Mainly, there is the torque in a 3.x motor. This puts 1st gear
vulnerability right at the top of the list as Walt pointed out so eloquently.

Desperately looking for any angle, I came back with "what about all those
racing 914's with 3.x and 901's"  which Walt also pointed out.

The answer, "yeah, but those cars all weigh a lot less  even than your
2250 lb 911".

Damn.  So add about 1500.00 to the engine upgrade job and be happy that
your 915 can handle it.

THe bottom line is that a 2.x motor with less torque will probably be all
right, and you'd be fine for a while with a 3.x, but long term you are going
to be happier with a 915.

YMMV,

Vol
