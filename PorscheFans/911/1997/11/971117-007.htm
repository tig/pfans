Didn't mean to mislead you.  I too don't make it a habit of lugging the
engine because it really does stress the engine in ways it wasn't designed
to handle.  The only time I've nailed it from idle speed in various gears
was in looking for a mixture problem.  If it stumbles, it's a good
indicator that something is wrong with the fuel delivery/ignition system.
Otherwise, I just idle around without even touching the accelerator in
parking lots and when I get on the road, accelerate easily until around
2000rpm when the fun begins!

I'm continuously amazed at the quality of Porsche engineering.  I just ran
my first driver's ed this weekend and my 18-year-old car with 130k and
engine never opened up, ran 50-60 laps of Road Atlanta like a champ and
came back begging for more.  And I was most definitely NOT babying it!  All
hail Dr. Porsche!

Subject:  engine massaging?



Mark-
 No my engine is indeed totally stock. I guess modification is what you
 mean
by "massaging", like hot cams maybe? Not the case here.
 However , the car has been having some minor trouble recently with
possible rich mixture, and maybe also spark advance curve may be a little
off. I am currenly investigating step by step. So I am not sure what is up
with it just now, but generally my car has never liked to be floored in
fifth gear at 800 rpms.... In fact I have known darn few cars that enjoyed
that sort of treatment, as I recall. My Dad told me that 'lugging an engine
like that will really stress the crank and rods, don't do it!" when I was
just a kid.... Generally the car is very drivable at low engine speeds,
just not at 800. I too like the boatlike rumble of the engine at idle and
just above.
 I wonder what the Pfans Oracles will have to say on all this....? RWC.
