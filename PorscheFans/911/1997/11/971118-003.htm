Perhaps you have heard the story about the two Cobra owners who went hunting
for a Christmas Tree?  They parked by the road side and walked into the
woods.  They walked and walked for hours, until it was getting cold and
dark.  It began to snow.

Finally, one Cobra owner said to the other:  "I don't care, I am cold and
tired.  I say we take the next Christmas Tree we find, even if it doesn't
have lights on it."

>My only advice is to have a P-mech handy that doen't mind holding your
hand.  There are many special tools needed to rebuild an engine.  Several
can be re-placed with a little creativity.  However, there are still several
that you'll need to purchase or borrow.
