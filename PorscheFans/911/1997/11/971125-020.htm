I still say that in five years we will wonder why we ever panned the
design.

It's not like the Porsche design team that did the 993 and Boxster was
suddenly fired and replaced by a bunch of morons that did not have more
than 8 years of design experience. This design will evolve just like the
901 of '63. It will get better and better over time.

I suspect that people would have criticised anything other than slight
changes to the design and that was not a practical approach. And folks,
the car looks like a Porsche....just not the Porsche you want it to look
like.

I reserve judgement on the interior untilk I can sit in the car.
