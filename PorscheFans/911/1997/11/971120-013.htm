Coleman,
Having run through several sets of Pzero tires on my '90C2, I can attest to
their short life span.  Usually two sets of rears to every front set
replaced.  About 9-13,000 miles is all I've come to expect on Pzero rears.
Pirelli recently changed their "system" normally requiring 2 Asymetricals
on the rear and 2 Directionals on the front, to Asymetricals all the way
around.  Still the Tread Wear indicator is 140 for the Pzero tire.  I
recently went to BFG Comp T/As on the front, since the Tread Wear indicator
is 220, therefore allowing more miles between replacements.  If these tires
keep performing like they have, I will replace the fronts soon with BFG
Comp T/A's.  Besides I don't really need such a sticky tire for my street
driving, and use BFG R1s on the track.  I never had any chunking though.
The Comp T/A's work rather well on the street, though not as well as a
softer compound like the Pzero's.

Now I've heard many war stories about running non-identical tires on a 911,
but due to excessive tire wear, excessive cost and excessive ragging by the
wife, I opted to try running different tires front and rear.  Much to my
surprise, they work great and haven't experience the tracking that I'd come
to expect.  In fact, the new Pzero Asymetrical fronts
tracked something fierce until about 2000 miles had elapsed.

I run 205 and 255x17 on the street, using Pzero's and now BFG Comp T/A in
the same size.  I also run Goodyear GT+4 M+S on 204 and 235x16 in the
winter, as well as BFG R1's on 205 and 255x16 on the track.  Not to mention
my Jeep Cherokee.  This equates to many dollars annually for tires!  But
damn I have a good time!  Grin and bear it.  ChrisK.
