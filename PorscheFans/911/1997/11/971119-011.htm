Hi, Gary,

Great! Hope we can welcome you to the "clan" real soon!

A well cared-for SC should have no problems with 100 to 130k miles. There
are reports of SC engines going for very long distances (250k miles) without
being opened up.

Be careful checking the records, *have the car checked out by a good P-car
mechanic* and I don't think you will have a problem.

I would personally go for a 100k mile car with full records over a 50k mile car
with scanty/no records.

> What are the common trouble spots to look for?  

Check the FAQ, at:

http://users.deltanet.com/users/guthrie/911.htm

> In what year did 911s first have galvanized bodies?  Living in an

Everything I have seen says that 911s were fully galvanized starting
in mid-1976.

> Were there any major/particularly desireable mechanical updates that

The FAQ mentions all of this. If you find a car that already has Carrera
tensioners, you're better off, because you will want to add them yourself
anyway!

Sorry - can't help here!

Cheers and good luck,

Ross
