Steve,

You responded about the rotary switch in the brainbox with some hunches
that, if the data I have is correct, are pretty close.  This is second-hand
and not guaranteed in any sense:

	Position		Fuel Mix	Timing
	0		Std		Std
	1		3% rich		Std
	2		6% rich		Std
	3		3% lean		Std
	4		Std		2.7=B0 retard
	5		3% rich		2.7=B0 retard
	6		6% rich		2.7=B0 retard
	7		3% lean		2.7=B0 retard
