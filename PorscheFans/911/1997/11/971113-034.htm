Hi David. 
	Yes, it is possible to find a 911 for $9000 or less. I have friend who found 
a passable '79 SC Targa for $9500 recently. Runs ok at 135K miles, but does 
need paint, a driver's seat, and some AC work. A really nice car like his 
would have run $12 to 14K I think. I would not sell my extremely nice, low 
mileage '81 for less than $16K for sure. If you are willing to consider cars 
from the earlier years, or maybe a 912, you can get pretty nice cars in the $6 
to 10K range. There are even rough but running cars for like $3500. But one 
gets what one pays for.  
	But if you hope to get a nice, well kept '85 or so, you will need twice as 
much money as you seem to have in your budget. I would suggest however, that a 
well kept older car is a much better idea than a rough dog of a newer model. 
Repairs/restoration can ear you alive! Remember, practically any used car will 
need something done to it, so don't spend all your money buying the car. And 
remember, you have to eat too...Also, as I recall from my dating days, when 
you pick a girl up with your Porsche, she will expect French food, haha.... 
Good Luck,  Warren, '81 SC, which is definitely not for sale.
