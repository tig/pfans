Someone asked about a dipstick oil heater.  I've used these on Vws, and
seen them advertised for 356s.  Hard to imagine one of these being very
practical on a 911.  Even if you could get one the right length to go into
your sump tank, in order to heat it has a wire coming out of it which you
plug into 120 VAC, so how would you put the cap back on with the
heater in place?  Plus the regular dipstick is short and goes in at an
angle.  Only the tip of it would be in oil at any time (and none of it after
the car sat for a while), and that wouldn't be enough to do much
effective heating, would it?

If a person needed to preheat the oil, I'd suggest the following:  1) buy an
oil sump heater blanket.  You can purchase these from Pegasus and
other racing sources.  These are like tough heating pads, and you hold
them onto the tank to be heated with duct tape or self-vulcanizing rubber
tape or some silicone adhesive or a combination of the above.  I've got
one of these wrapped around the front mounted aftermarket sump in my
race car.  Seems to work, at least somewhat.  Practical problems here
are fitting it around the spot welded edges of the factory tank, protecting
it from debris from the tires, you've got to take the tank out to put it on,
will one fit effectively given odd shape of the tank and how close it fits to
the sheet metal on the inside, etc.

2) What is probably a better notion is to purchase, from same racing
sources, what amounts to a small immersion heater.  You take your oil
tank out, weld in a bung in a suitable spot, reinstall tank, screw the
heater element into the bung, and it is ready to plug in.  Issues here
involve knowing where inside your oil tank the baffling is, so the heater
element will insert through the bung and not promptly hit a baffle.  Can't
say as I know where the baffling is or isn't.  You could remove drain plug
and look or poke around up in there, maybe not a problem.  

Another thing to think about is this:  when you stop your car after getting
home from a drive somewhere, the oil sump tank is full (remember that's
when you measure oil level - with oil hot and engine idling), and there is
not much oil in the engine's sump area - it is a dry sump system. 
However, as soon as the engine stops, oil starts draining from the sump
tank into the engine.  It doesn't do this all that quickly, but it does drain.  It
must be able to flow (remember the upper part of the tank sits up fairly
high relative to the bottom of the engine) by gravity through the oil pump,
and either leak out along the shaft at the end of the pump (which isn't
sealed) or leak into the scavenge side along the shafts there and down
the scavange inlet into the sump, or both.  Anyway, when you open the
engine drain plug you need a pretty big pan if the engine has been sitting
for a while.  Soooo, heating the oil in the dry sump oil tank isn't going to
heat all of the oil - a fair portion of it will be in the engine.

Minus 20 degrees F is about as cold as I have had to start my car (which
it did just fine), although if I had to do this all the time because I lived in the
Frozen North or even Crested Butte, Colorado where I once lived in my
VW era, I would think more seriously about preheating the oil if I didn't
have a nice garage.  But there must not be much of a need for this
commercially for 911s, as you don't see much mention of this.
