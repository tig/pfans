Several days ago I posted a message about double clutching where I
mentioned a funny story.  Well it's time for that story.  This was
told to me several months ago at breakfast before a track event at
Sebring. =20

A good friend, and accomplished racer, was working with someone to
help them improve their driving skills.  After several sessions, they
had the following conversation.  If you have ever been to, or driven
Sebring, you will appreciate this even more.  In order to protect the
innocent, I'll use Instructor and Student in place of the names.

Student:  When you go into the hairpin, you down shift from 5th to
2nd?

Instructor:  Yes

Student:  Do you skip gears, or go through each one?

Instructor:  I go 5th to 4th, then 4th to 3rd, and finally 3rd to 2nd.

Student:  And you double clutch each time?

Instructor: Yes

Student:  Let me see if I understand this.  You push in the clutch,
take it out of 5th, let out the clutch, blip the throttle, push in the
clutch, put it into 4th, let out the clutch.  You push in the clutch
again, take it out of 4th, let out the clutch, blip the throttle, push
in the clutch, put it in 3rd, let out the clutch.  You push in the
clutch again, take it out of 3rd, let out the clutch, blip the
throttle, push in the clutch, put it in 2nd, let out the clutch.  Is
that correct?

Instructor: Yes

Student:  All of this while braking and dealing with traffic?

Instructor:  Usually, if traffic is real bad, I'll down shift from 5th
to 3rd.  Then to 2nd. =20

Student:  Oh

That's the best I can remember it.  It does not read a funny as it was
told.  If you have never been to Sebring, let me try and explain the
section of track.  Coming into the hairpin is a section called "Big
Bend"  This is a long gradual curve taken flat out.  In a full race
prepped 911, you are probably doing 120+ before getting on the brakes
for the hairpin.  The hairpin is a 30mph corner at best.  So in the
span of 10-15 seconds, the above scenario is played out each and every
lap.  The student was just amazed at all the footwork.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone
