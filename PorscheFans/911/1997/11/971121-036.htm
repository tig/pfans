Why New Chain Tensioners? 

>Ps: New tensioners, new gaskets here and there, new tubes also, (whatever 
they are)...$996 total !     --according to Greg.
	
**************
Greg-- my 2 cents worth:
	I believe the tubes you mention supply the oil pressure necessary to operate 
the newer Carrera style chain tensioners. The upgrade is mainly that the 
tensioners are now fed by oil pressure from the engine oil pump, rather than 
just being pressurized from within, rather like a gas shock or hood lift 
device. And we all know what happens to old shocks and hood lifts... if that 
happened to a chain tensioner, the chain could well come off its 
sprockets/gears, and valve timing would be way off, and the pistons could 
crunch into the valves, leading to major internal destruction of the engine. 
That, I believe, is why we recommend the upgrade... 
	Many older cars are still running with their original tensioners working just 
fine. But one will find in the scrapyards some decent looking older cars, that 
were not rusted or wrecked... Many of these died very suddenly when the chain 
tensioners let loose. Guess the owners didn't have the $4 to $7000 needed to 
fix the motors. Junkyard owners love the old tensioners, haha. The dismantler 
either sells a used motor, or gets a nice body to part out! So the $1000 for 
the new style tensioners is expensive peace of mind, but probably worth it. 
	All this being said, my '81 SC, with 45K miles, still has the old original 
type chain tensioners (engine and tranny have never been out of the car or 
opened up), but someday soon I will likely upgrade, I suppose.
	 I understand that, when the old chain tensioners start to go, I will hear a 
fairly loud and distinctly unusual new sound at low rpm's, from the loosened 
chains . This noise, I am told, will likely go away at higher rpm's when the 
chains take up the slack from rotational forces, but I personally doubt that 
operating motor at higher rpm's with loose chains is a brilliant solution to 
this problem, haha. The theory is, if I catch it early and limp the car to the 
mechanics (or flatbed it!) I just may get away with it.-- At least this is my 
understanding of the situation...
	 Funny, generally, I am not a gambler, except on stocks...!    

	-Was there an upgrade that came stock with the SC's?    I am not sure. 
	-What the heck are these "guards" I hear about?    Don't know exactly....

	PFans: responses/criticisms definitely solicited here!   Warren.
