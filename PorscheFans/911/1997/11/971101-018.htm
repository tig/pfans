I have an 87 Targa with only 23 K miles. In warm weather, the front hinge
assembly     of the targa top emits lots of squeeky noises. Any suggestions -
silicone spray, adjustments, etc?

Welcome to PorscheFans!

For an easy way to join, leave, etc. a list, visit the PorscheFans web site
at http://www.PorscheFans.com/.  All Porsche related questions should be
posted the appropriate list.

This email message gives you important information about using this list -
please save it for future reference.

========================
Sending mail to the list
========================

To send a message to all list members, use a message with the following form
(the email address is case insensitive):

 --------------------------------------------------------------
         To: 911@PorscheFans.com
    Subject: Problem with brakes

    Can anybody help me figure this out?
 --------------------------------------------------------------

If there are list errors or you have an administrative problem with a list,
you can send an e-mail to listmaster@PorscheFans.com.  Please include the
list you are having a problem with, and a detailed explanation.  DO NOT send
Porsche related questions to the listmaster!  Please address them to the
appropriate list.

The following PorscheFans lists are available:

    General     Anything relating to Porsches, but not a specific model
    356         Porsche 356 and 912 Engine
    911         Porsche 911 and 993
    914         Porsche 914
    924-944     Porsche 924, 944 and 968
    928         Porsche 928
    Boxster     Porsche Boxster

=========================
SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION:
=========================

The easiest way to join, leave, etc. a list is via the PorscheFans web site
at http://www.PorscheFans.com/.  To go directly to the subscription page,
surf to http://www.PorscheFans.com/Subscribe.html

There are two ways to get the messages from PorscheFans: digest or
non-digest.  We recommend DIGEST mode.  This sends you a daily collection (or
"digest") of all messages for that list.  Not only does a digest keep your
in-box from getting REALLY cluttered, and it drastically reduces the load on
our mail server.  Digests are compiled and sent out at midnight, Pacific
time.  Non-digest mode means you get an e-mail EVERY TIME someone posts a
message to the list you are on.

If you are already a member of PorscheFans, and you want to switch your
subscription from regular to digest (or vice versa), you don't have to quit
the list.  Just send either a JOIN (to switch to regular mode) or a DIGEST
(to switch to digest mode), and your subscription will be changed.

If you try joining a list that you are already a member of, you are politely
notified that you are already a member.  So sending multiple join requests
doesn't subscribe you multiple times.  Just one per customer (or e-mailbox).

It is NOT necessary to specify your e-mail address in the message to
subscribe@PorscheFans.com -- the sender of the message is the one subscribed.
 If you specify a different e-mail address than the sender, the address
specified is subscribed, not the sender.

Messages sent to subscribe@PorscheFans.com are automatically processed.  So
don't send any questions to this mail address, as they are never viewed by
human eyes.  The subject of these messages is ignored.

None of the e-mail addresses or subscription commands are case-sensitive.
 Sending a message to SUBSCRIBE@PorscheFans.com is exactly the same as
sending a message to subscribe@porschefans.com.

NOTE: If you are joining multiple lists, please make sure that each request
is on a line by itself, and that there are NO BLANK LINES between the
requests.  The automatic subscription processor ignores everything after the
first blank line.  We also recommend that you put at least one blank space at
the beginning of the line, as some e-mail software word-wraps outgoing text.
 Only the first subscription request on a line is processed.

---------------------------
SUBSCRIBING IN DIGEST MODE:

To get a daily digest of a list, send an email message to
subscribe@PorscheFans.com with the body:
    digest <name-of-list>
For example:
    digest 356
To join all the lists, send an e-mail message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com
with this in the body of the message:
    digest General
    digest 356
    digest 911
    digest 914
    digest 924-944
    digest 928
    digest Boxster
    digest Racing
    digest Flamers
    digest Tavern

-------------------------------
SUBSCRIBING IN NON-DIGEST MODE:

To join any of these lists, send an email message to
subscribe@PorscheFans.com with the body:
    join <name-of-list>

    join 356

To join all the lists, send an e-mail message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com

CANCELLING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION:

To leave this list (either regular or digest mode), send an email message to
subscribe@PorscheFans.com with the message:
    leave <name-of-list>
For example:
    leave 356

If your email address has changed since you joined, you can append your
original email address:
    leave 356 <old-email-address>
For example:
    leave 356 joeschmo@doe.com

------------------------------------------
CHANGING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION E-MAIL ADDRESS:

To change where your subscription is being sent (for example, if your e-mail
address has changed), you must un-subscribe from the list with your old
e-mail address and re-subscribe with the new one.

For example:
    leave  356 joeschmo@doe.com
    digest 356 joeschmo@test.com

This can easily be done from our web page at
http://www.PorscheFans.com/Subscribe.html

=========================
SUBSCRIPTION SUSPENSIONS:
=========================

The PorscheFans list processor will suspend your account automatically if it
was not able to deliver to your mailbox after three days.  To re-activate
your subscription, you must go through the subscription process again.

===========================
POSTING A MESSAGE TO A LIST
===========================

To send a message to the list, send an email message to
    <name-of-list>@PorscheFans.com
For example, send an e-mail message to:
    Boxster@PorscheFans.com

You will automatically receive a confirmation when your message has been
received.
