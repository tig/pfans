Well folks, 

after a couple of months of lurking, I think I found my first 911. I
should go pick it up tonight, but I don't want to jinx it and shout my
joy just yet... It's an 83 SC in immaculate condition, which I felt made
up for the relatively high mileage (114K). The compression check
returned 170 or 175 for all cylinders, and under 5% leakdown, which I
thought was pretty good for that mileage. It's got  a brand new
clutch/tranny... 

Body wise, there isn't a dent to be seen, the tips from the FAQs showed
me the car was not involved in any accident or that it's been superbly
repaired ! I am amazed that a car this old could look this pristine !
And it's platinum, which I heard was quite rare for an SC (but feel free
to tell me that was a seller's pitch).  Engine wise, it doesn't have the
chain tensioners upgrade, which I also find amazing !  That will be the
first thing I'll do to it, and I am kind of nervous about driving it
without that upgrade. Are they more likely to break at high rpms ? It's
listed as a $1000 thing here and there, am I correct ?  
.
