><My problem is that the adjuster/insurance company is insisting on "Quality

><repair and don't want to spend money on new factory parts.

Interestingly enough, when my '76 911 was rear-ended the other person's
insurance company quoted all new factory parts (without me having to ask).

Of course I didn't use any of them...I took the money and spent it on fiberglass
bumpers, fender flares, etc..... :>))

Good luck,
