Hi-

I'm looking for some advice.

I bought a 1979 911 targa 8/96. I got a decent deal ($9500)
mostly because the heat exchangers were rusted out. Anyway,
in December of 1996, I had a local shop put in some used non-stainless
heat exchangers which they procured for me ($800 installed).
Anyway, at that time they informed me that the heater blower
motor was not working. I decided to wait to replace that until
I had the courage to do it myself. So, for about a year I
have had only a wisp of heat which smelled a bit of exhaust.
Last Friday I installed a replacement heater blower motor, and
now I get a decent flow of heated air, BUT, there is a huge
amount of exhaust entering the cabin via the dash vents! It 
seems to be coming from the right side sash vent primarily.

Questions:

1 - where is the exhaust coming from?
2 - Any obvious hoses, etc. to check ?
3 - After a year, do I have any recourse with the shop
    that installed these heat exchangers, if they are
    bad ?

TIA,
Don
