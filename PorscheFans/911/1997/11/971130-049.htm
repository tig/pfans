The following was posted yesterday:

The following in a list of many care products that I have been using on
my Boxster for the past 6 month and with which I am VERY pleased. I have
everyone of the following products (yes, all three of those waxes and
cleaners) and have used them on my Boxster and/or BMW 318ti.

This is list of basic items neccessary for the car of the car's interior
and paint. There are other specialized items I have used. I post this
list for those looking for information of this type. It is MY personal
recommendations and based on information gathered from many discussions
and personal experience! I am willing to provide sources for the
products via private e-mail.

I hope you all find this helpful.
