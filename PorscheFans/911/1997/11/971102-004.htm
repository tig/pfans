Mike, I strongly suspect the master cylinder is going bad; this is similar
to my experiences on my old '76 when I had it.  I think I did 2-3 MC 
replacements in the 150,000 miles I had the car.  I, too was using the 
brake bleeding technique you described, several times per year due to
running PCA track driver's education events.  I beleive that this bleeding
technique pushes the MC piston seals past their normal wear limit, and 
prematurely wears them out.  I switched to a pressure bleed technique in 
early '90s and have not had a problem yet with MC seal damage.

My 911's brakes seem to have gotten slightly spongy recently.
A second pump of the pedal seems to firm them up a bit.  My
brakes are well bled, and the fluid is new.  I haven't noticed
any leakage from the master cylinder, but I suspect this com-
ponent since I have been using the "person-behind-the-wheel-
mashing-the-brake-pedal"  method of brake bleeding for years
now (my 7 year-old and I are experts...)

Under constant pedal pressure, the brake pedal doesn't move
towards the floor.  Does this sound like a master cylinder
problem, or should I look elsewhere?  There aren't fluid leaks
anywhere and the calipers have been rebuilt, etc...

Any suggestions?
