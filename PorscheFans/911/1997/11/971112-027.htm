David, for pricing, try www.traderonline.com (do a search
under autotrader).  You can find all Porsches listed in
trader publications nationwide (Over 1000 Porsches listed).
Lots of these are FSBO, and will give you a realistic range
of (asking) prices.

I'm a new owner, and as for the discussions regarding
problems -- this is actually a great source and will tip you
off on what problems to look for.  P-mags such as Excellence
and 911&Porsche world can be found at larger bookstores.

Also  just about ALL major newspapers carry their classified
sections online.  Great way to check up on prices nearby or
across the country without buying a paper.
