I have a 1968 911T (Euro) that I am interested in beefing up over the
next couple of years in a serious way. However, I am curious as to the
limitations of the early style 5-speed (901) transmission currently in
the car. How much power can this gearbox reliably take without
destruction? I realize the type 915 transmission is a beefier unit, but
I'm trying to work with what I have as much as possible. Also, I plan to
pull the original 2.0 out of it and replace it with a larger engine. I
believe I can put anything I want in it with no problems (ie 3.0, 3.2,
etc.) but I want to make sure. The vehicle is fortunately structurally
sound, and has an upgraded suspension already. If anyone has done this
sort of work on an early SWB car, I'd certainly like to hear from them
and get some advice. (I've been told that rebuilding the 2.0 for more
performance is a waste of time and money, and that swapping for a bigger
motor is the most effective way to go.)

Thanks in advance for any responses-
