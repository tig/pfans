Steve,

>P.S. - why selling?  I just plain don't like it.

I am sorry you feel this way.

>I have an analog guage with level I like much better. 

Which one?

>I also 
>don't particularly care for the "attitude" I got from the company 
>(SmartProducts), 

Unfortunately, it was me that replied to your e-mail.  I didn't mean to
show any "attitude".  As I recall (I suppose I might still have the message
somewhere...), you had problems with the accuracy and the "feet"  poped-out.  

>who accused me of mistreating the original guage, 

The bottom "feet" usually pop-out due to the unit being dropped.  We have
NO problem fixing the frame if this did happen, but this (dropping it) is
usually the cause. Some of our re-sellers ship the frame with the "feet"
mounted, this can also cause the feet to pop-out.  I am sorry if my asking
you if you dropped the frame was offensive, but it is important for us to
know why they came out.  It is like if you blow the engine in a new
Porsche, they are going to want to understand why in went up in smoke.  We
are happy to replace any unit that shows any signs of defects.

>which I used exactly once.  Could just be my sparkiling personality, who
knows!

Unfortunately I think that my reply may have a tad too much to the point.
This probably struck a nerve.  <This seems to happen alot on the internet.>
 If you want you can return your SmartCamber to us and we will happily
refund you your money.  BUT, when people have issues with the SmartCamber
it is usually (not always) that they are not using the unit properly.
After they have a quick conversation with Craig Watkins (the disigner),
they usually never call back and are happy with the unit.

So, hopefully you will be willing to give Craig a call.  If not, feel free
to mail it back to us for a full refund.

I don't want there to be any hard feelings.
