The total disassembled carcass of a 911 T is now on its side in my garage.
An inexpensive media blasting/paint booth was built with 2X2's in the form
of a box 8 X 16 feet and 7 feet high. This box frame is covered with 6 mil
clear plastic and has an old bed sheet across the high half of one end and a
20 inch box fan blowing ventilating air out the other end. The negative
interior pressure works well during striping keeping the media from leaking
into everything in the garage. The pressure will need to be positive when
the Glasurit base and clear coat are applied. Of course, the plastic will be
changed for that step ($18 at the local hardware superstore). The media is
quite dusty and requires a blasting hood available from Eastwoods. The hood
lens would fog almost immediately but a foot long discharge pipe clamped to
the exhaust valve of the respirator cured that. The UPS delivery person
almost died from laughing when hood removal revealed elephant man. Most of
the entire underchassis has been striped, there are some areas where the
factory undercoating is so tenacious that it will be left rather than blast
through the floorpan.  Tomorrow I'll weld the rear swaybar consoles to the
chassis and then weld a butterfly insert I fabricated to reinforce them,
Next, I'll spray epoxy primer and then the Wurth underbody seal black.

Rebuilding the pedal box has been difficult due to the clutch shaft rust
welding to the clutch arm. I took it to a machinist with a mega press. He
just called and said he had to cut the shaft to press it out -- an expensive
miscommunication. Anybody have a clutch shaft or pedal body for a reasonable
price? Not another part to fabricate -- you gotta luv it.
