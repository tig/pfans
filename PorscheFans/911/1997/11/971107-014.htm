I'm not a physicist but I'll give it a try.

What you need to remember is that, although weight transfers under 
braking (and acceleration), mass does not. Roughly 60% of the mass 
remains over the rear wheels at all times. In a corner the lateral 
force applied to the rear wheels will be 60% of the car's mass times 
the lateral acceleration. The force on the front wheels is only 40% 
of the mass times the lateral acceleration. This 60/40 distribution 
of lateral force is constatant (assuming a constant turning radius) 
and unaffected by acceleration or braking.

Under static conditions (no accelleration or braking) the frictional
force that the rear tires can provide before they start sliding is
the weight on the rear tires (60% of the car's mass times gravity)
times the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road.
The fronts can only provide 40% of the car's weight times the
coefficient of friction. If you set the formulas up for a condition
where the car is not sliding, you can see that mass and wight
distribution cancel out (i.e. the additional weight on the back
makes up for the addtional lateral force).

    lateral force < frictional force
    0.6 * m * lateral_accel < 0.6 * m * gravity * coef_of_friction
    lateral_accel < gravity * coef_of_friction

Now, as soon as you hit the brakes, the wight transfers to the front 
and the frictional force on the rear tires is reduced accordingly. 
The mass, howerver, does not transfer so the lateral force on the 
rear tires remains unchanged. If the lateral force on the rear wheels 
was already equal to the frictional force (the car was at the limit), 
the rear wheels are now sliding. By the same token, the frictional 
force on the front wheels has increased due to the weight transfer 
while the lateral force has stayed unchanged so the fronts now have 
more "bite".

It does and it is. That's why Porsche did things like adding wieghts 
to the front bumper and putting two batteries ahead of the front 
wheels. Keep in mind though that as you come out of a turn your 
line is straightening out. That serves to reduce the lateral 
accelleration which means you don't need as much grip.

The above is a gross simplification and ignores factors such as power 
output through the rear wheels, aerodynamics, suspension geometry, 
steering inputs, tire dynamics, etc., but it gives you the basic 
idea.
