Hello again Saqib, I am happy to hear of your grin...
	I have an '81 SC, so it is close but not quite the same as yours. Mine idles 
at around 1250 until she warms up, then settles down to about 8-900 or so. 
Mine does not like to be driven at much less than 2000 rpms in general. Lugs 
and lurches at 1400. She does not really get singing till the tach is over 
3400, and the torque gets fun at 4000....I learned on an older 911 that it is 
fun to keep the rpm's above 3000 all the time when actually driving. 
	I hate traffic jams in the 911, as I must continually stir the shifter and my 
left leg gets a little tired. But around town, the car will drive smoothly in 
3rd, so I am not sure if there might be a mixture or timing adjustment 
necessary on your car. I have heard that my '81 is supposedly smoother than 
the '78 and '79 cars, as I think they have a smog pump and mine does not. But 
a friend had a '79 that I drove, and it was very similar to mine.  
	By the way, I suggest you get a little Flapper Valve installed on your fuel 
injection air box ASAP. This will keep it from being ruined if you ever get a 
backfire. This is common on SC's, and the valve fixes it. An air box is about 
$230 installed...Good luck, happy Porsche-ing, and Keep Smiling!    .. an SC 
is a great car, I have had mine forever.       Warren.
