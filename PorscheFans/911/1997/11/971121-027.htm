Hello PFans -

John and Juha were discussing the one and two wire temp
sensors on the 3.2L 911's - It got my curiosity going, so 
I checked the factory wiring diagrams - it shows the second
wire going directly to MP-XII, which is a ground point - so, I
seems that the two wire sensors are (also?) grounded thru
the connector, not relying solely on the cyl-head for grounding.

Only one wire is shown connected back to the DME - it's funny
though - the wiring diagram shows the two pin harness connector,
but only shows the temp sensor connected to the one wire, not 
to the ground - in other words, the no-connect is shown on the
diagram!

I don't think, based on the diagram, that the two wire is any better
than the one wire - except that it may get a better ground!  If I saw
two wires going back to the DME, I'd be on the phone to Vertex 
right now, ordering a two wire temp sensor!
