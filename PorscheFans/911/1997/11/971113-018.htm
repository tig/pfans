Warren,

Yes the steel braided brake lines give a much better pedal feel.  That is
why most track junkies and all race cars that I am aware of use them
exclusivly.  But like most "race" parts, they were not designed for the
normal driver that jumps in their car everyday without paying any
attention to the condition of the car.  The braided lines need to be
checked once in awhile to make sure nothing has happened to them.  I had a
friend on roll his IMSA Firehawk car when the steel braded line broke.
After the car was back at the shop, we discovered that the failure was at
a spot where the line had been kinked.  We never did find out how the line
was originally damaged.

As long as you are willing to pull the wheel on ocassion to make sure that
have not been pinched, kinked, or damaged in some other way by road
debris, they will be fine for your street car.

Just my opinion, not the final word.
