Wayne asked when in '76 the cars were galvanized.  
Porsche began galvanizing in '70 or earlier.  They started with the floor pans 
and basically worked their way up the chassis until the entire car was 
galvanized.  As I recall, '76 was the first year the rust warranty was offered 
for 3 or 4 or 5 years (obviously my memory is vague on this last point).  The 
length of the warranty period takes you back to the first year the entire car 
was galvanized as I recall.  So, long way to the answer, by any month in '76 
the entire chassis, including roof was galvanized.
