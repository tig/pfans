While the discussion of the appropriateness of this type of conversion is
likely to spark a religious war, I have seen two 993 conversions that
turned out quite well. One, I photographed for my client, Automotion. It
was a kit done by M.A. Shaw (advertises in Excellence & Pano) and the other
was a kit by AIR installed by the owner of the car (yellow car in AIR ads,
also in the same magazines.

I was quite impressed with the results of both. But it's my guess that
unless you have extensive experience with 'glass, you will need to pass
many dead presidents into the hands of your body man.

Some cautions: I think most kits come without the decklid/tail because of
the variety of choices you have. The bodywork will clear any variety of
wheels, but if you want a 993 'look', you'll need to add spacers and
late-offset wheels. Also, there's some controversey among makers of these
kits as to where you mount the tail lights--in a housing connected with the
rear bumper or in the quarter panel molding. You'll need to discuss with
the vendor what feedback they have on getting it right.

Finally, two other alternatives: Automotion, my client, sells a kit, but I
have no experience with it, so I couldn't  give thumbs up or down. By
Design (advertises in Pano & Excellence) sells Factory sheetmetal and
bumper covers--for a  premium over fiberglass replica kits, of course, but
not as much as you may think.

BTW: I have U.S. 993 driving lights and tail light lenses for sale, as well
as Factory 31mm wheel adapter/spacers if you should decide to go ahead with
this conversion.
