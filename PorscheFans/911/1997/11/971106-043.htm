Bob, the cable is held onto the butterfly by a tiny bolt, a couple of =
washers, and a nut.  The cable threads through a hole in the bolt, and =
then is held in place by tightening down the nut.  Mine were so rusted =
that I had to use a Dremel tool and a cutoff wheel to cut the nut off.

You can buy these parts individually, but Stoddards (800-342-1414) sells =
them together as a kit for a reasonable price.  Ask for their part =
number SIC.211.001.00.  You might be able to price and order it through =
their web site at www.stoddard.com.

If you do damage parts of the valve, you can buy all of the small parts =
separately without having to buy the whole thing.  Also available from =
Stoddard's.

Hope this helps!
