That's the nature of the Listserv. My Cab runs fine and I have no real
problems. It would get boring if 1500+ Porschefans folks sent in reports
every week saying "my car's fine, no problems to report". When you look
at cars that are over 5 years old, some problems are bound to crop up.
BTW, there's a very nice black '89 Cab with gray leather & C2 wheels for
sale for 30K here in Louisville (member of our Region).
