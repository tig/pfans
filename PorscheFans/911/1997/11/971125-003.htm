Coleman, 
	I must say your post on the sad 996 design is so cogent and well considered 
that I have saved it along with other gems from the Pfans list. When I first 
saw pics of the new shape, I thought it was dull but ok, and that it would 
likely grow on me. I was very let down as I had been all fired up about a new 
"911". Since then, I have decided I don't hate it, but it just lacks spark for 
me, and I feel it is simply less than "Porsche-like". 
	The new design has, to my eye, somehow dropped many of the the visual clues 
and proportions that would have positively declared its 911 heritage. It is a 
pleasant and  passably decent looking car on the whole, but just not 
distinctively Porsche to me. The 993 was still a 911, quite evolved but 
clearly identifiable. I think this loss of continuity and the lack of clear 
911 identity are the 996 designers' greatest failures. 
	The new interior seems prosaic, and I really miss the familiar guage array, 
flawed as it was; however, I hear the car is very commodious and comfortable. 
I have yet to drive one, but I am sadly not salivating to do so (a first for 
me, I usually rush to the dealership when a new car comes out). I have lusted 
after many Pcars for many years, but so far this is not one of them. Maybe I 
will like it when I do drive it.  
	As for the water cooled engine, I understand that this was unavoidable from a 
technical perspective, due to emissions and performance requirements. Yet the 
water cooling also marks and emphasizes the end of the era. I hope the 996 is 
a success in the market, if only to ensure continued parts availability for my 
old buggy. 
	Thanks again for putting into cohesive form many of my random musings on the 
new car. I concur that the best line on the car is the rear window line. I 
thought the "plaster filled balloon" image to be an excellent 
description....The round headlights are also sorely missed.
	Maybe the lackluster 996 will grow on me with time... but for now, what a 
disappointment.  Warren. '81 SC.
