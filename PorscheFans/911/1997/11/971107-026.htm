Christian,


	>What is wrong with my logic here?  Just curious?


Logic, part 2, is corrrect.  Accelerating through a turn does transfer

weight to the back, and lower the traction available at the front.  
This

will increase plow (plough? for the Brits?) or understeer, or REDUCE

THE NATURAL OVERSTEER of the car, which is the relevant bit

for us 911 drivers.  At low speeds you'll get the plow from almost

any 911 if you're turning sharply.  At higher speeds you'll turn an

oversteering condition into a neutral one by staying on the gas.


In part 1, I think you need to be careful about weight versus mass.

There is only so much weight to go around.  Having transferred weight

to the front, you had to transfer it FROM the back.  So there is no

'added weight in the back'.  Rather, there is SUBTRACTED weight

in the back.  The mass is still there, the motor, trans, etc, but it's

floating a bit off the ground, with precious little to keep it
cornering.

So the mass is trying to swing out, and there isn't enough weight

pressing down on the tires to keep this from happening.  That's why 

the back end comes out.
