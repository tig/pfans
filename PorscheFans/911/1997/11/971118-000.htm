Walter,

Let me clarify my "torsion bars do wear out" statement. Torsion bars do
break and they do sag. A broken torsion bar is warn out! One that sags
will still work right, but the ride height is altered. You can fix this by
adjusting the ride height. The spring rate of the bar does not change
unless there are fractures. A torsion bar with fractures is worn out.

One advantage a torsion bar has over a spring is that when a torsion bar
sags, its range of travel is not compromised. Adjust the ride height and
the bar should work as if it was new.
