<< Any updates you can add to your earlier note?  I'm finally at the point of
 seriously considering one of these ignition systems... and maybe the
 HPV-3, which has more capability at a higher price of course :-)  Do you
 still like it as well as you did initially?  Thanks.

Hi Tom,  after a full season of PCA events I heartily recommend the HPV-1 or
I'm sure the 3 would be even better.  

I feel that the motor is making a little more power, or perhaps it's just
able to pull
in the upper RPM's better with the new system.  It works great, it is a set
in once
and forget it type system, and has performed flawlessly all year.  

You really get a feeling for the true precision at which it operates when you
get it
installed & go to set the timing with a light (just to check the dial's
accuracy).  The timing mark is absolutely dead still at 6K RPM.  It does not
move & wander around
like the distributor did.  If not for the sound of the motor you would think 
it was not even running!

You will need to make up your own plug wires using the recommended wire type.

Also, you will need to buy or fabricate the mount for the trigger wheel &
sensor, as
well as a plug for the distributor.  I got a set from Hewett Engineering in
Calif which
worked perfect & looked almost too nice to use.

Good Luck,
