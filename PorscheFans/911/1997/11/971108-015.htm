No (see below)

Your '86 has the same transaxle as the '80 - in fact, '86 was the last
year this box was used on the 911.  There should be the same allen plug
on the side, just like your '80. I broke a cheap breaker bar the first
time I tried to remove mine - I now have an 18" breaker bar of much
superior quality which makes the job pretty easy.  There's about a
hundred recommendations on re-filling - I just use a suction pump and
it's done in about 15 minutes.  IMPORTANT - make sure the re-fill (top)
plug is removed BEFORE draining.  You don't want to drain unless you know
you will be able to re-fill!

Hope this helps,

P.S.  Let us know how the Mobil 1 works (I presume you're trying to "fix"
difficult 1st & 2nd gears?)  I've got Swepco in mine now, but didn't see
much of an improvement.
