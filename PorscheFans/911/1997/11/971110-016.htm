My 1980 911SC has lost significant power (accelerates like a VW).
Basically it feels as if the fuel flow is greatly restricted.
Occaisionally backfires (yes I have a  pop-off valve).  My mechanic says
that the chip that controls the (California) emissions (located under
the passenger seat) has gone bad. Last week they took the box apart and
cleaned all the leads etc. That seemed to solve the problem for a few
days (didn't drive it Sunday), but the problem came back today with a
vengence.

Does anyone have any other possible explanations before I spend $250+
and labor to get a new chip?

on a lighter side:

False, those are not stag antlers but stylized dragons (3 on a yellow
shield) from the crest of Wurttemburg. I know because my
Great-Great-Great Grandfather was born in the "Castle" of the Duke of
W=FCrttemburg. BTW, Porsche has a major facility in W=FCrttemburg.

If you are interested in the Castle of the Dukes of W=FCrttemburg, there
was an Excellence (magazine) cover a few years ago showing multiple 911s
in the courtyard.
