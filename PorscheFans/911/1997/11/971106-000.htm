"Grateful Thanks be to you, your Lordship, for your kind and gracious words of

	Never knew about the silicones in the ArmorAll, thanks for the insight. I 
have never observed the whitish stain you mention, but your points about the 
oily carrier solution is likely on target. Have never had "slick seats" 
problem, but leather is rather  shiny for about a week. I do wipe off the 
excess, as the manufacturer suggests, at any rate. Someone else has told me 
that Armorall should not be used on tires or outside rubber trim (bumper 
accordions?)as it may cause water retention and rot, don't know about this but 
am mentioning it as possiblity. Rather arcane subject it seems, much voodoo 
and mysterious claims and effects... Warren, Journeyman Porschephile.

Warren,

Rise, knave and be at peace with the world.

Armorall is apparently loaded with silicones.  As long as they stay in 
solution (as delivered) things are OK, within reason.  If you stop applying
Armorall, the solvents dry up and the silicone precipitates out as a
whitish stain.  I don't think the silicone is doing the leather any good,
but that's just an opinion.  What may be helping is the oily solution
in which the silicones are delivered, and Hyde Food will do this better.
Absent the Hyde Food, I'd use Lexol (thin coat, well wiped down).  My
sense of the Armorall is that I don't like it anyway (too wet or slick an
appearance when used on rubber or vinyl) and that leather is a pretty
special commodity and needs its own stuff.  Same for WD-40, which
appeared later in the thread, I think.

Also, I'd think the Armorall would make the seats too slick, no?
