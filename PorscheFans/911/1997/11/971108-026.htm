aloha,,, has anyone using the cambermeister strut bar run into problems
adjusting the camber??? on doing a wheel alignment the other day ..ran into

the problem of not enough adjustment to set camber....allen bolt for camber

adjustment was already hitting the rear gusset of the strut bar mount...I need

to take out some negative camber (1.5) but unable to do so...the other side

has about 3/16 more room to adjust the camber..but it's at .4 negative so I'll

leave it and watch tire wear and handling...what I'd like to know is if I can

cut part of the strut bar gusset (3/4") to get more adjustment without

sacrificing strenght???  semms like it would not affect it too much but would

like to hear it from others...

      while I'm at it I also noticed there was not much adjustment left for

caster..mines at 5 degress positive but I'd like to increase it to maybe 7 or 8

degrees pos. for better high speed stability...I noticed some fast cars with

as much as 10 degrees pos. caster...anyone hve opinions on this caster thing???


  my main concern is however the problem of camber adjustment using the

cambermeister.............aloha,,,,merlin   87'  930
