Ahhh, this sounds like a clogged fuel injector.  My car began running
very badly at a Time Trial a couple of years ago.  Sounded terrible at
idle with small backfires audible.  It was very low on power until about
3 or 4k rpms, where it would smooth out and return just about to
normal.  It ended up being a clogged fuel injector.  Evidently, fuel was
coming out in a stream that wouldn't combust very easily at low rpms,
but once the engine speed increased, I don't guess it cared how the
fuel came out.

The solution?  A 20oz bottle of Techron in about 8 gallons of gas.
Cleared it right up.  I have since replaced my injectors, but the Techron
seemed to totally eliminate the problem.

Good luck,
