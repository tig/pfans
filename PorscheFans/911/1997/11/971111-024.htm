From the Ferrari web site:

           "The story of the prancing horse is simple and
           fascinating. The horse was painted on the fuselage
           of the fighter plane flown by Francesco Baracca, a
           heroic Italian pilot who died on Mount Montello:
           the Italian ace of aces of the First World War.

           In 1923, when I won the first Savio circuit, which
           was run in Ravenna, I met Count Enrico Baracca,
           the pilot's father, and subsequently his mother,
           Countess Paolina.

           One day she said to me, "Ferrari, why don't you
           put my son's prancing horse on your cars; it
           would bring you luck." I still have Baracca's
           photograph with the dedication by his parents, in
           which they entrusted the emblem to me. The horse
           was black and has remained so; I added the canary
           yellow background because it is the colour of
           Modena."

                              Enzo Ferrari
