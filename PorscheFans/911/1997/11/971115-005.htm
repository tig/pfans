Greg, I checked from my toolbox and Dow 111 is not a sealant,
it's silicone grease. At least my Dow 111 tube is grease for O-rings.
Extremely good stuff, but using in a cat engine, as Your -86, =

might destroy the O2-sensor.

Some time ago I was corrected here that using silicone in an engine
with a O2 sensor will destroy it, the O2 sensor of course.
I checked with Bosch and was told that silicone used as sealant or
such will transfer to combustion chamber and coat the O2 sensor.
Was also told that silicone will burn off, but at a higher temperature
than the O2 sensor can handle.

There is O2 sensor safe silicones, but have no idea if Dow 111 is such.
If You check this from Dow, please let me know.

Don't know the Automotion "special" price, but Vertex $18.00 each. =
