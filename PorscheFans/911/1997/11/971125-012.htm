I had a front end vibration that took me years to resolve.  I did all 
of the standard things.  Replaced the tires, balanced the wheels 
(numerous times), installed steering rack spacers (and my car isn't 
lowered), aligned the front end (numerous times), adjusted the 
wheel bearings, and checked my wheels for concentricity.

It turned out that the problem that I was having was associated with 
the brakes and rotors.  My brake calipers weren't fully releasing and 
at about 65 miles per hour they would rub against the calipers just 
enough to cause a vibration.  After I rebuilt the brake calipers and 
machined the rotors, the problem was finally resolved.
