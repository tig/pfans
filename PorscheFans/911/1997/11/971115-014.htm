John, Geert, et. al.

I'm seeking advice on the behavior exhibited by a failing speed sensor.  

My problem began 10-days ago when something suddenly felt "wrong".  I
noticed that the idle suddenly became erratic and that I "stalled" the car.
 In fact, the engine lacked power when starting from a stop.  Tonight, I
pulled up to a traffic light and the engine died.  I was immediately able
to restart it, but it lacked low speed power and almost died a couple of
times.  I think the dying without warning symptom is the most troubling and
I fear that it won't restart on time.

I've checked the temp sensor which seems good (high resistance cold, 150
ohms hot).

Do my symptoms sound like a bad speed sensor or do I need to look further.
Also if I replace the speed sensor, should I replace the TDC reference
sensor at the same time.  I do plan to replace the temp sensor with the
two-wire version.

Thanks for any ideas,
