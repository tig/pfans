Hey fellow P-Fans, 

I have several parts I'm looking for and also a couple of questions for
anyone.  Thought I might start here and find someone that's stripped their
car  interior for racing and have "spare " stuff laying around. 

First the parts for my 84 Targa. 

I'm looking for the following: 
 
Visors for an 84' Targa. Black

Leather Shift Knob 

Rear deck speakers and more importantly the speaker  trim rings. 

Drivers side mirror, need mirror itself not necessarily metal housing. 

Plastic Rear seat belt cover sleeves, also bolts that secure belts to body.  

I also have a set of rear interior side panels for a 76'  in black vinyl that
are in perfect shape. I don't need them so If someone has a use, you can have
them,  just pay the freight. 

Catalytic tube. 

Questions:

Water leaks to seat belt assembly on drivers side of car. After heavy rain
whole drivers belt is wet from the point that the belt exits the reel housing
behind the side panel. Is it leaking through the exterior air vent in the
roll bar (Targa)??? More importantly if it is wet on the belt , where the
hell is the water going to? I fear a rust problem inside the roll bar support
tunnel. YIKES !!!   How do I get into that area without damaging something if
it is? 
 
How difficult is it to remove disc brake rotors ?  I have a Haynes manual but
directions are sparse. Are there any tricks I should know ?  Front and rear.
Any special tools needed?  Should I have them turned replace them? 

I have a small black box of unknown purpose in the rear control panel
compartment. It's currently unplugged and it worries me. the PO cut the wires
at some point and then hooked them back. He may have replaced the original
component????? The box is about 2 inches square, has what appear to be
cooling fins on top and it's located at the very rear end of the control
panel. It has two wires going to it both of which disapear into the overhead
firewall bulkhead. Can't figure it out as everything works, ie rear defroster
.. HELP All other components shown in the Haynes manual are there and
accounted for. 

Rear seat belt bolts, the ones that secure the belts to the car body/frame.
Extremely hard to remove. It unscrews for a distance and then becomes extreme
stiff to turn. is there a fastener somewhere under the body that needs to be
removed?

How do you remove / replace the bushing in the rear shift coupler. I know how
to get it off but not sure how to get the pin out and pull the bushings out.
Want to know what I'm expecting before I strat. Does the pin press out  or
just push or slide out with minimal pressure? 


Sorry for the bandwidth !
