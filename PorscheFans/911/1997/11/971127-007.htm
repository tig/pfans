Let's add so to the 996 'ok or not' thread...
What dissapionted me mostly about the new 996 is that it doesn't look like
a 'muscle-car'. Where are those mean agressive fender flares, which look so
good on our 911s?
Sorry but even though this car is more powerfull, it just doesn't look like
it ready to do some serious bussiness...
I think that what the designers at Weisach forgot about is that the
P-loving crowd we are, don't buy with their minds, but with their heart,
soul, guts or what ever you wanna call it. It's emotional (afterall,
otherwise we'd probably buy something like a NSX), so we don't care about
ergonomics, we want a car that looks and feels like it's right of the
track, a some what civilized racer, not a sportssedan (I mean do we really
need more interior space? what for? As far as I'm concerned they could have
taken out the backseats completly. The only person I'd wish sitting there
all cramped up is my mother in law. Even in the bigger 996 it's a shitty
place to sit.
It's hard to believe that the team that designed the Boxter and 996 also
did the GT1, which is just stunning (help me to stop drewling please).

Let's just hope they come with something decent in about another 5 years...
Ahhh... what am I making this fuss over, a new 996 is way out of reach
anyway 8^)
