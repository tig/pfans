<<I saw your post about a 930 as a first car.  My first
Porsche is a 930.  I had heard the same stories about rear
engined cars and all that and it worried me a bit.  In
reality, it is not like that at all.>>

I agree.  My 79 930 is the first 911 that I have "owned" as my personal
car, and I have to say that ist is as comfortable, safe, and easy to
drive as any other car that i have been in.  If you don't respect any
car it will bite you, but in a 930 you just have to remember that you
are dealing with a lot of power and weight placed in a very different
plac than most of us are used to.

<<On the street (if you are driving normally) you will never know the
difference.>>

They are a little touchy in the rain, but otherwise very docile. 

<<A corvette has much more torque and can do it a lot easier.>>

Yes, but you're still only driving a Corvette, and I have never been in
any Corvette that is even nearly as fast as my 930.  Not even a 98.

Would I recommend a 930 as A first 911 experience?  Probably, but be
ready for poor fuel economy, high maintenance costs, and the biggest
smile that you have ever tried to wipe off your face.  Just respect it
and remember that you are driving a car that costs morethan most
people's homes.
