Carmen,
Talk to me.  Where can I get these?  I've never seen them advertised and
don't know what to do about the chassis wear in the front wheel wells.  I'm
running 205x45x17 fronts and 255x40x17 rears.  I also run 205x16s on the
fronts sometimes.  This chassis rubbing has me worried though.  Help.  TIA,

ChrisK

Subject: Re: Rear Tire wear and Brake Pressure solenoid on 964
  Coleman,
The tires on my C4 (P700's) also wear 50%/80% front and rear with mostly
street driving :-) and 1-2 DE events per year.   Asking around this
seems normal for a 964.  I am also running 17" C2T 7"/8" wheels. With
the amount of understeer from the 205's in the front, I'm feeling less
guilty about chucking them when the 255's go.  What front and rear sizes
are you running and are you satisfied with the balance?  Any clearance
problems?  I've already rolled the front wheel wells and installed the
steering limiters.
