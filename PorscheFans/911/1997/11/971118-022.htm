Ron has raised an interesting question:  Do torsion bars wear out?  One answer
was yes, like any spring.  Walter summarized nicely, mentioning the disasterous
consequences to the microcracking wear mechanism that Ron proposed.

I agree with Ron that basic metallurgy suggests that torsion bars do not wear
out.  Excepting for the microcracking phenomenon, the spring rate of a bar
should not change significantly when cycled within its elastic range.  Some
materials do, but as far as I know high strength steel and/or iron do not.
The corrosion issue is serious, however, since it can invade the bar through
surface defects and cause cracks to propagate.  But Ron said that his 30 year
old bars were cosmetically clean.

Here's another angle:  The torsion bar is only one component of our suspension
mechanism.  Another is bushings, which obviously do wear.  Another is the
spline teeth at each end of the bar.  It is possible that 30 years of abrasion
could wear these teeth, creating "slop" in the joint and loss of "set".  This
could be patched by re-adjusting ride height, but a true repair may involve
replacing all splined components.  In any case, spring rate would be preserved
as far as the bar is concerned, but perhaps not for the entire mechanism.

Hmmmm....
