They were not the same car as far as VIN numbers are concerned. The point
I am making here is using the same styling on different cars is not new at
Porsche.

Well, I would have to disagree. Let's take 1965 as a sample. The 911 had a
0-60 time of 7 seconds according to Car and Driver. The 1965 912 took 11.7
seconds according to the same publication.

The 911 may not have been quite as balanced as the 912 due to weight
distribution, but it sure as heck would have beat the 912 on just about
any country rode that was not Lombard Street. Anytime there was a straight
the 912 would be eaten alive and it would not make up THAT MUCH in the
corners.

I am not disparaging the 912 here. Let's just not elevate to a level it
does not deserve. The 911 is the better sports car. My family had a '68
912 and I like them very much but I am not blind to the realities of the
situation either. The 912 was a lower cost car that was not equal to the
911.
