Robert - I had same problem with the fresh air fan switch on the dash
when I got my 77 in 84.  The switch is nothing more than a metal spring
finger which slides from one contact on an open board to another as the
lever is moved.  These contacts are inadequate for the current (which
might perhaps increase with age, as the fan motor is nothing to brag
about and eventually will make noises and give out), and the contacts pit,
corrode, and flat burn out.  I was astounded when I saw how it was
constructed.  After trying various palliatives like a little sandpaper on the
contacts or something, I cut the wires and attached them to a (4?)
position Porsche AC fan rotary switch (I think - anyway I got it from
Automotion or someone, with a suitable knob insert).  There is a hole in
the dash (the steel backing - you have to punch through the dash
covering) to the right of the steering wheel which is nicely placed for
this, as I recall.  The original lever just sits there looking nice but doing
nothing and harming nothing.  My switch isn't quite as convenient -
turning a knob rather than that easy lever - but it looks as if it belongs
and shows no signs of wearing out.

Some years later when doing more extensive work I think I removed the
whole apparatus and maybe saw how I might have refurbished the
original system.  I may be misremembering.  but it is a poorly executed
design, which is why it fails long before it should.
