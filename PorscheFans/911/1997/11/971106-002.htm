I enjoyed reading Henry Watts' explanation of the different 
methods of blipping, rev matching, double clutching etc.
(Also his book is very good)
I'd like to add my own opinion, as follows:
I've seen a lot of drivers at drivers schools who are otherwise
very skilled who just try to get away with letting the clutch
out slowly to match RPM's on a downshift.  As Hank points out,
thats BAD and eventually you'll get into a problem with such
behavior.
   The theoretical "best case scenario" is where the driver
double clutches, blips twice, and matches revs all in one
shift, making life real nice for the transmission, rear tires,
engine, clutch etc.  I don't think too many people can do this.
   What I recommend is to stop worrying about the syncros.
Don't double clutch.  At the track you are downshifting to
fourth or third, and second gear is the syncro that wears out
first on street driving.  So just use the syncros - that's what
they're there for.  
  For a typical braking/shifting situation, I suggest braking,
clutch in, downshift, roll right foot over to blip throttle 
(while still braking), then clutch out.  If you can do that
well, you're ahead of 90% of the other guys out there.
