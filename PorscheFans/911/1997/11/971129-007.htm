I believe I read somewhere that the C4 can be sensitive to differences in 
tire rolling diameter front-to-rear; differences affect front-to-rear power
control since the center differential senses the different rotational speeds
of the front and rear driveshaft.  Might want to do some measurements
to see that they are equal.

He also could try accelerating a little slower; car is good, but can't always
conpensate for a bad nut behind the wheel.

A friend of mine who also drives his C4 in winter called and stumped
me. He claims that when he accelerates on icy surfaces from rest, the
car kicks out to one side.

What he expected was for the car to track straight ahead perhaps
slipping a little sideways (torque effects) while spinning all 4
wheels.

He called his dealer and asked about the torque/power split. Porsche
says 45 percent power transfers to the frnt wheels. Not what he saw
though. He gets the dealer to call PCNA in Reno, there he is told
"max 15 percent, actually we shouldn't call them 4WD"!!!!

The car has ABD and limited slip.  Does anyone (like Bruce) know what
the real scoop is?
