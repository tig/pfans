 '86, 911. After determining that all fans were running and all fuses were
good I did some further investigating. I spread the split rubber that covers
the area where the Brake Handle protrudes from the plastic housing that is
in between the seats. The housing that contains the rotary knob for the heater. 

I used a flashlight and a small dental mirror. I saw a linkage rod that had
fallen off the ball where it is supposed to be. I then removed the four
allen head screws that hold the black plastic housing to the car's floor.
(not easy to do!) I lifted the forward part of housing about 4" and then
could clearly see the linkage. It is a steel rod about 6" long 1/8" diameter
with a black plastic fitting screwed onto each end of it. The plastic
fitting has a socket hole that is supposed to fit onto a ball joint. One
ball joint is on the heater lever and the other ball joint is on a motorized
device that moves about 1 to 1.5" as you rotate the heater knob. With the
ignition key on but engine off, I turned the heater knob to #1 and watched
the ball joint move a little bit. The higher the knob setting the more that
ball moved. It was this ball joint that no longer had the steel rod linkage
on it!!! It seems the plastic socket assembly has a flimsy clip arrangement
that is supposed to hold the socket to the ball. On mine, the flimsy part of
the socket, the clip, broke and that is why the whole socket popped off the
ball.

I assume that is the reason for no heat.

So now the trick is to get a replacement plastic socket/clip part. If I can
find it I'll get a few as spares since it does look flimsy. Maybe they have
switched to a metal socket and clip by now. I hope so.

"THREE DAYS LATER".....

I picked up a used linkage with both plastic clips INTACT!! The place is in
Connecticut. He sells used Porsche parts. I told him to give me a 2nd one
for a spare but none of the many he had in stock had both clips intact!!
Seems that plastic clip is a weak link. 

I installed the link. You have to be patient with this. (And it helps if you
have some acrobatic experience) I got an allen wrench that has a handle on
it long enough to reach the four screws holding the plastic housing to the
floor. I did not have to remove one of the seats. Snapping the clip closed
when it is hard to reach was tricky. I fashioned a hooked tool from a piece
of 1/8" diameter aluminum ground wire about 12" long. It enabled me to reach
the clip and snap it closed.

I started the car. Warmed it up. Took it for a 4 mile spin and lo and
behold...I now have heat!!! All ranges of the rotary heater control knob
working!

If all your blowers are working then this may be your problem. You can do a
fast check by putting car on lift and with the engine off but ign. on, look
under the rear of car near the rear wheels for the heat control boxes. There
is one near each wheel. These are both controlled by cables that move when
that linkage moves. Have someone turn the rotary heater knob to 1, 2, 3 all
the way to 6. Stop at each position for about 15 seconds. You should see
that cable moving a little bit more with each heater switch position. ANd
when the cable moves it moves a rotating flap attached to the heater box to
allow hot air into the ductwork.

Good Luck.

Let me know if this linkage was your problem.
