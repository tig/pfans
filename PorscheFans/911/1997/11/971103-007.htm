I used to use armorall in my vehicles, but was warned that it would actually
dry out the dash, and once you started using it, you ALWAYS had to use it.  I
never had a problem with it in my old '86 Mazda truck.  After just a few used
in my '95 VW, though, the dash wasn't looking that great...

A few weeks ago, on a testdrive of an '87 Carrera, the owner of the car
explained to me that WD-40 made a great dash protectant.  I thought he was just
kiddding me, but he was dead serious!  (BTW:  This guy was a Porsche
enthusiast, and just LOVED the cars...)  He said, "It looks much better than
armorall, b/c it's not quite as glossy.  Plus, it's good for the plastic/vinyl,
b/c it's petroleum-based."

So, this weekend, rather reluctantly, but curious, I "did" the dash of my VW
with the WD-40.  Wow!  It looks great!  All of the dry-looking spots left over
from my armorall days disappeared!  And the stuff spread really evenly.  And,
it's not greasy like armorall, and doesn't leave finger prints when you touch
it.  I'm IMPRESSED!

Don't know of any long term effects of using the stuff, though, so there's the
caveat....

BTW:  I ONLY use Lexol on my leather - I'd never use armorall (or WD-40) on
leather!...

Anybody got any ideas why NOT to use WD-40 on the dash?

Dave
