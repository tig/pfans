I've not used it myself, but there have been very active discussions on
my other list among people who own the G-Tech and the Vericom (a more
expensive device with more functionality). People are very impressed with
it's accuracy IF you control the test conditions properly, which seems to
be the biggest problem. One person used it while making dragstrip runs
and came within a tenth of his times against the clock. Apparently it can
also be used to test braking time, distance and G-force. The testing
problem is to find a level piece of road without traffic and test runs
both ways to negate the wind effect. Temp and barometric pressure can
also affect results if the comparisons are done too far apart. Testing
immediately before and after mods are done seems to produce satisfactory
results for the G-Tech owners, giving an objective measurement versus
what your "butt dyno" tells you.
