Joe,

I just had a similar experience with my 78 SC, turned out the previous
owner had cut the power supply wire to the blower, rewired it to the input
side of the relay (causing it to run all the time!!) and replaced the 25
amp fuse with a 5 amp one, which probably promptly blew.

Anyway, to answer your questions, under the little black cover in the LHS
of the engine compartment live 3 fuse holders and two (??) relays.  On the
back of the cover is a diagram of what each is for.  The top fuse is for
sportomatic cars, the middle is for your blower and the bottom one is for
the rear window defroster.  Similarly, one relay controls the blower motor
(the round black one at the rear one as I recall), and the other is for the
rear window defroster.  The blower gets turned on by pulling up on either
of the red heater controls by the handbrake (the switches live under the
handbrake boot.  

The Haynes manual covers this stuff quite well.

Hope this helps
