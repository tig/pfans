The only exterior part of the 996 that looks like the Boxster is the front
end. The rest of the car is completely unique. In fact, now that I have
seen many pictures of the 996, I think the styling of the car is unique in
the industry. In essence, Porsche has stretched, widened, and smoothed the
993 shape. It is clearly a 911. You cannot mistake it for an Acura or any
other make.

When the first pictures of the 996 came out, I hated the car. But the more
I see it the more the shape grows on me. If the 996 is like the Boxster,
it will look excessively better in person than it does in photograghs. I
can't wait to see on in person.

It is unfortunate that Porsche chose to use the Boxster front end on the
996. However, it is a good looking front end and it does go well with the
rest of the car. I have had quite a few Boxsters behind me and I can say
that they look quite nice. I don't know if I would say better or worse
than a 993 or 964, just different. I certainly don't think any Porsche
front end has ever looked reptilian or like a Koi.

Something else to note here is that Porsche had to make changes so the car
could move forward into the next century. This is not a marketing slogan.
It is reality. To move forward, the car had to change. A water-cooled
engine was a must to meet noise and emission standards. To accomodate
radiators and have reasonable luggage space, the car had to be made wider
(without flares) in the front. This fit nicely with the need for a wider
cabin with more hip and shoulder room.

I personally believe Porsche has designed a great car. I think it needs
some flares to make it look more musclular, but I would guess that is
coming. Think back to the 901 and how smooth it was on the sides. It was
clean but somehow lacking compared to the later cars.

I would be willing to bet that 5 years from now, no one will question the
"Porchseness" of the 996. Some may still like the 993 (or 964 or 901) look
better, but it will not be the common opinion.
