I need help.. I own a 1971 911E with a 2.7S engine running on 40mm webers. I
experienced a problem when starting the car after work yesterday. The car will
not rev.

It appeared fine on the way into work, but when started it would idle, but as
soon as the throttle was moved it would stall.

I have replaced the following, but still no joy.

Coil/Condensor/ Distributor Cap/fuel filter..

I am getting a good spark at the plugs, apart from stripping down the carbs
does anybody have any suggestions on what it could be. It it strange that it
happened all of a sudden and I didnt experience a problem on my journey into
work.

I am also getting a good fuel "squirt" into the carbs.
