Scott,

I had this problem for about a month on my 1967 911.  The problem stopped when the gas tank rusted completely through and leaked ten gallons of gas onto the garage floor.  There was no doubt where the gas smell in the house came from :>)

It went from no visible wetness under the car or on the car to a steady drip.  The tank emptyed itself over night.  Externally, the tank looked fine, no rust, cracks, etc.  I had scraped off all the undercoat on the bottom of the tank.  The one remaining patch of undercoat just above the drain hole was where the breakthrough in the metal occurred.

The good news was that the garage floor was really free of oil for the first time since I had bought the car and I had remembered to turn off the air compressor the night before.  The bad news was that it happened less than a week prior to the once-a-year RMVR driver's school that I had to attend in order to be able to race that year.  How do these cars develop their exquisite sense of timing?

PS.  I used to work for Tek VXPL and visited Bton fairly often.  I noticed an older 911 in Bldg 19's parking lot. Was that your car?
