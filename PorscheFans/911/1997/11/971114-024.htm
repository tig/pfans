This task is doable for the amateur; I did it :-)

1) Raise car.

2) Drain oil from case and tank.

3)  With a pair of pliers, grab the old return tubes.  Twist and Pull.
The original tubes are about as easy to crush as an aluminum can, so
removal is fairly simple.

4)  Prep your new Viton seals (I used motor oil in lieu of Dow 111 after
consulting with my mechanic. No leaks after about 18 months).

5)  Install your new collapsible tubes and work the lock-ring into
place.  I found working the lock-ring into place to be the most
difficult task because the exhaust system gets in the way.  Just be
persistent and patient.

As for a supplier, most anywhere is cheaper than Automotion.  I have
been pleased with Zims (they advertise in Pano), both from a price and
service perspective.

The small oil drips from my valve covers have been joined by more
significant
leaks toward the midline of the engine.  It appears that the oil return
seals have headed south,so it looks like replacement time.  I get the
impression from the list that this is doable for an amateur, but I'd
like to
get everyone's advice before I do something stupid.

Automotion has the expandable tubes with Viton seals on sale this month.
They
recommend Dow Sealant 111.  Is there a better source for these?  How do
I
remove the old tubes?  Any other tips greatly appreciated.  Thanks in
advance.
