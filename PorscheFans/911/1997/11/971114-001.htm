Before I discovered the joys of R1s, I used a variety of street tires during
DE events.  One of these sets, Yoko AVS Intermediates, worked very well
in the rain.  I'm not sure what your definition of "reasonably priced" is, but
these tires were alot nicer than most of the other tires I used in the wet.

Good luck,
