>>OK, this has been bugging me for a while.  Bear with me on this:
Many of us have had the experience of the phantom puff
of smoke at start up, which then goes away.  We've all been told
this is normal.  Conventional wisdom would suggest this to be a function
of valve guide wear.  Yet, cars have been taken apart which
occaisionally puff at start-up with no evidence of valve guide
wear (Or so I've been told). <snip>

Volney - I've got a 2.2 and it does this on almost every startup. I've
read like everyone else that this is a common quirkiness of most six
banger Porsches.  This summer I had to pull my engine to repair the
dreaded clutch fork pivot pin problem that us 70-71 2.2 owners know so
well.  Anyway, while I was waiting for the part to arrive (My SO and the
UPS man have a standing chuckle every time he arrives with a package, "
Nother car part Mam!") I decided to paint the shroud, etc.  I removed
the carbuators and manifolds and low and behold, there was a little
puddle of fuel sitting in the intake portion of the heads on several of
the cylinders right around the intake valves (obviously a good seat!). 
Therefore, I conjector that the "puff" of smoke is not oil at all, but a
bit of rich mixture upon start up.  Not sure what allows this to happen,
leaky float bowls....?? Now this may answer the question on carburated
cars, but of course not necessarily for those with FI.

since LeMans.
