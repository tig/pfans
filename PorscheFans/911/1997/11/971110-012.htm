I can definitely speak to your question about others who may have an Alfa
to supplement their driving pleasue.

I currently have two Alfa Spiders.   One is a stock '84 and the other is a
'74 with Webers and a mild cam (even though it is still apart!)  I also own
two Porsche 911's, one a stock 1968 and the other a 1969T which is being
built up into an RSR replica.  (needs a lot of help!]

The cars have a very different personality , but are both fun to drive. 
For serious road thrashing, nothing beats a 911 for sheer enjoyment.  The
speed, handling, and engine noise make it the closest thing to a racing
machine.  Driving around town in a Weber carbureted, cammy 911 cam be a
little frustrating at times, but on the open road (with lots of turns and
twists), it can't be beat.

The spider is for open road, open air, high speed touring.  It is extremely
well mannered at speed, but is easy and civilized in town.  It is the
definite choice  for cruising, as long as the weather cooperates.  In very
cold or very hot weather, the spider stays in the garage.

To put it in perspective, I could sell the alfas, but could only sell the
911's if I was getting another one.
