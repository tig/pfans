Troy,

I've had one on my car for about 6 years now, and it works great.  Much
better than the cheapie kit that has you gluing on a new ball on the lower
end of your stock stick.  The other advantage is that you can do the job all
in one go, without having to wait overnight for the epoxy to cure.  (Besides
which, I do not trust epoxy all that much!)

One thing I found with the Welmeister kit (which they may have fixed by now)
is that the large alloy spacer plate has the Welmeister logo cast into it.
That of course prevents the Porsche shifter assembly from sitting properly.
In my case, I machined the logo off without any problems.

While you're in there, replace each and every bushing, as well the the
bushings in teh shift coupling.  Get the new polyurethane bushings if your can.

Altogether, the Welmeister kit is very good value.
