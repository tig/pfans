Hi,

I bought my 84 911 3 months ago and I never bothered to confirm that the
additional defroster fans (locate near feet) were working ... it turns out
they are not.

My Haynes manual shows most of the wiring diagram for the car but not were the
wires and relay are physically located.  Could anyone help me with the
following:

1) Where is the relay for the additional heater fans(L&R) located?
2) Where does the wire bundle(from fans) go once it goes thru the bulkhead.  I
trace it going up under the fresh air box but without removing that I can't
find where it goes next.  I thought a question to this list could avoid
removing any unnecessary parts.
3) Is there a better source for the wiring diagrams that might show physical
location?

One thing about the 911 that still amazes me is the number of little
compartments, hatches and covers ... and the 5 fans it has!

Thanks for any help you can offer.

Best Regards,
Chip            mailto:cobb@ti.com
