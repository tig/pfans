Pfans,
 I have an '89 Carrera that has been experiencing intermittent speedometer 
operation.  Most of the time it works, other times the needle stays at 0 MPH, 
and the odometer stops incrementing.  Sometimes it will be "dead" and then start 
working while I am driving. When it stops working, it is when I am starting off 
from a complete standstill.  Based on these symptoms I suspect the pulse sender 
rather than the speedo itself.  Has anyone changed out the speedometer sender on 
an '87 to '89 Carrera before? Is it one of those well-known 911 problems where 
cleaning/reinstalling the sender would fix the problem (much like the 
intermittent wiper relay problem)?  If the sender needs to be replaced, is it 
very difficult to do or is it "better left to the professionals." Finally, where 
exactly is the sender attached on the G50 transmission housing (I am assuming 
that is where it is attached)?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
			regards,
