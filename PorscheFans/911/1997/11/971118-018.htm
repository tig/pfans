Hi, Greg!

Congratulations on your purchase!

I'll take a stab at a few of these.....

I sure hope you mean "oil level gauge"!!!! (judging from the context, this
is what you mean).

It's normal to see a low or nonexistant reading when the engine is cold. It's
also normal to see a low or nonexistant reading when you're underway. The only
time the reading is close to being valid is with a warm engine, car idling
on level ground (after idling for 30-40 seconds or so). Nonetheless, don't
believe the gauge - check using the dipstick (again with the car idling and
on level ground same as above).

> 	- Druck ?  Is that like instant pressure ? That was pegged at
> 3.5 the whole trip. 

Druck is German for pressure. Sounds like you've got good oil pressure. THIS
is the gauge you don't want to see at 0 while running! ;^)

> turned on when the headlights are on ? 

Some others have found that the ashtray light has dropped out of it's hole
and is hanging loose under the dash - perhaps this is what's happening to
yours...

Vibrate over bumps or in a straight line? If the car's lowered, you will
probably get more bump steer than normal (and the 911 is known for having
a moderate amount of bump steer anyway). This can be partly alleviated by
installing a steering rack spacer (and re-doing the alignment).

If it's not bump steer, then the "normal" causes are all possibles:

- alignment
- tires
- wheel bearings
- brakes

etc etc.

..... then it will fail THAT MUCH sooner. If you don't have the Carrera
tensioners, GET THEM!!!

> 	- Is there a manual for climate controls in a FAQ somewhere ?

Someone recently put a good climate control note out on the net... I'll
see if I can find it...

It will last longer with double clutching & rev matching on downshifts.
Your $$$$....

Dunno about damage, but when cold, I try to keep mine between about 2500 and
4000 rpm. It's highly inadvisable to lug or really rev the engine with the
oil cold. I doubt you'd damage it at 2000 rpm, but high loading at very low
speed with cold oil is a bad thing.

Did you have the car checked out at a shop before buying it?

Sounds great!

Get used to it.... ;^)
