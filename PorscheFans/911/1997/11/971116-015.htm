A couple of weeks ago I asked for suggestions regarding my 89 Carrera
engine shutdown problem.  Of those who responded, 5 suggested replacing
the DME relay that's under the driver's seat, 1 suggested cleaning
corroded wires, 1 suggested it might be the DME unit itself, 1 suggested
replacing the ignition switch, and 1 suggested replacing the cylinder
head temperature sensor and the DME relay.  Thanks to everyone who sent
me their take on this!

I opted to start by replacing the DME relay; it was a 5 minute job ...
it's nice when a fix is so easy!   I've driven the car several times
since then and it has performed flawlessly.  I also bought the
temperature sensor so I figure I might as well replace the old one just
in case.  

Replacing the temperature sensor looks tricky:

1.  According to the dealer parts staff, the original sensor unit is no
longer available and its replacment is a 964 series part.    To adapt
the new sensor to the older engine, it's necessary to replace the new 
sensor's 2-prong electrical plug with an older  3-prong plug.  All the
necessary hardware came with the new sensor. 

2.  To install the sensor requires a special $75 Porshce tool,
essentially a long 14 mm socket with a slit one the side to allow the
sensor wire to protrude.   O.K. so far... I bought a $3 socket and will
cut a slit in it.  Looks like it will work, except that I don't know if
the sensor in the engine requires the same tool to remove it.  

3.  It's hard to get access to the front of the #3 cylinder head...
there's a sheet metal shroud in front of it and it'll be difficult if
not impossible to actually see the sensor.    I can see where the sensor
wire passes through the shroud, but I haven't gotten in any farther.

I'd appreciate thoughts from anyone who's replaced the temperature
sensor.  I hate to admit defeat before I even dive in, but this looks
like it might be one for my mechanic. 

Cheers!  Mike Monroe
