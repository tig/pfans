My 1971 911S is doing precisely the same thing, but on cylinder #1!  
There is an irregular, but frequent miss at idle, and sometimes it
sputters 
so badly it feels like someone moved my redline from 7200 to 5800 rpm. 

Last night I put new spark plug wires in, reinstalled an old distributor
cap 
and rotor, leaned out the idle mixture, sprayed brake cleaner (didn't
have 
anything else handy) all around the air intake stacks looking for leaks,
checked the number 1 intake valve clearance, swapped the #1 and #2
fuel injectors, but the problem persists.

Today a friend and I are planning to:
	* check all the left bank valve clearances
	* do a compression and/or leakdown test
	* recheck the timing and dwell
	* swap the #1 and #2 spark plugs

One interesting point:  When I cover the #1 air stack, the RPM's drop 
significantly, but when I cover any other stack there is very little
effect on RPM's.

Does anyone have any other suggestions? ...this has been very
frustrating.
