...... i'm sorry, i get emotional... it seems as now that
most of the cool
things about the car are now gone.... the things that made
it a legend have
all evaporated.. the quirky dash, the individual gauges,

Coleman,

I couldn't agree more. The exterior styling is
disappointing but I could live with it, maybe - with some
flares on the side to get rid of that slab side would be a
major improvement ( like the GT1 ). The interior however is
where they totally lost it. When Porsche went from the 356
to the 911 you still felt at home in it ( I have one of
each , an 356 Conv D and a 911SC ). They both have a
feeling of getting down to business, you have a feeling
that the gauges are what's important and that the others
are secondary (if that). The message is this is a sports
car - watch the tach, the oil, screw the radio and the
sunroof. The new interior seems just the opposite - it has
to be the gaudiest thing I've seen in a German car, hell
most Japanese cars aren't even that bad.

To me what Porsche has done is a 928 replacement, not a 911
replacement. Remember when the 928 came out - Porsche told
us how much better it was than the 911, the press told us
how much better it was than the 911, only the people buying
the cars didn't care. The 911 was unique, it had character,
a undefinable presence. The 928 bombed, the 911 flourished.
I hope for Porches sake I'm wrong or there may be no
Porsche for long.
