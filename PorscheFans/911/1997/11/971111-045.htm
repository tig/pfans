Dan Owens asked the following:

>Plastic Rear seat belt cover sleeves, also bolts that secure belts to =
body

I can't help you here, but I do have some advice.  The bolts are =
actually US thread (7/16 I think).  I had bought some Grade 8 bolts at =
the local hardware store and used those to attach some belts I bought =
from Automotion.  Then Kevin Gross asked how I really knew these bolts =
were Grade 8 given the source, and did I want to fool with my kid's =
safety.  That woke me up, and I bought bolts from Porsche.  Be prepared =
to pay.  I think mine were about $15 each, but Kevin (as usual) was =
right.  Not worth the risk.

>How difficult is it to remove disc brake rotors ?  I have a Haynes =
manual but directions are sparse. Are there any tricks I >should know ?  =
Front and rear.  Any special tools needed?  Should I have them turned =
replace them?=20
I'll just add to Ray Calvo's post.  Definitely soak the threads on the =
brake lines before trying to loosen them.  I have had better luck =
loosening the fitting on the caliper than at the hose.  Don't forget to =
use the Liquid Wrench on the bleed screws too.

I don't recall having to disconnect the lines to remove the rear =
calipers on my SC, but you will have to remove a metal clip that holds =
the rubber line to the trailing arm.  You also need to be careful that =
you don't kink the rubber line.  If yours are the original, you might =
want to replace them too.  I replaced mine a couple of years ago, and =
the old ones were very brittle.  Go with factory rubber lines, rather =
than the aftermarket stainless.

You may also have to back off on the parking brake adjustment to remove =
the rear rotors.  The 911 parking brake is actually a drum brake within =
the rotor.  You can access the star wheel for the adjuster through a =
hole in the rotor.

I don't think I'd turn the rotors.  Check the thickness of the rotors.  =
If they are scored badly or near the wear limit, I would probably =
replace them.  If they are OK, just use fine sandpaper on the rotor to =
remove any glaze before replacing the pads.

>Rear seat belt bolts, the ones that secure the belts to the car =
body/frame.  Extremely hard to remove. It unscrews for a >distance and =
then becomes extreme stiff to turn. is there a fastener somewhere under =
the body that needs to be >removed?
No fastener under the body, but the ends of the bolts are exposed under =
the car (above the transmission).  After all these years they may be =
gummed up or rusted.  I don't remember how accessible these are with the =
engine in the car.  See if you can spray some penetrating oil on the =
bolts from underneath, or carefully from the passenger compartment.  I =
think I'd just keep carefully backing them out.
That's all I got.  Hope this helps.
