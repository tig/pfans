I think it's because of the fuel question (leaded or unleaded) which 
was my first attribute to this list that I needed a punishment.

Yesterday I took my 911 to work. I think I forgot to switch off the 
rear window heather. By the way strange that my 1980 Targa 911 does 
not switch it off when taking out the ingnition key. 
At 7 pm I tried to start the engine but without result, the engine 
rotates but refuses to start. With the help a friend and startcables I was able 
to get the car running after a few trials. (Checked the fuses and 
adjusting the startcables)
Some strange behaviors were:
The tachometer shows 4000-5000 rpm even when running stationair. It 
feels as if the engine will stop if the RPM gets to low. When I came 
home it was to dark to investigate the problem. Next morning my 
battery was as dead as can be.
Any idea, voltage regulator perhaps, or just a battery that has gone 
bad?
