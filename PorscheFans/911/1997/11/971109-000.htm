HI Ken, 
	I am no expert really, maybe talk to Brian Buxton? (he's on the List), he has 
a 930 of his own, and he also sells Porsches, or finds them, or something like 
that....
	 What I do know is: Turbos are great, love 'em, but they seem to me to be 
maybe a little less reliable than the normal cars. And when they do break, 
your wallet will hurt big time. Also, the insurance is very expensive, of 
course.

As you request:

  	 A brief history, I think this is pretty accurate but limited by the very 
my small scope of knowledge :

1976 and 1977: First street Turbos, called 930's.    3 liter     234 hp     
6.7sec to 60   156 top sp.

1978-79:    3.3 liter    4.9 secs 0-60    165 top speed,    not sure of hp, 
guessing 260?

1980-1985  No Turbos sold in US, but many gray market cars brought in from 
Europe, where they continue in production. Don't know the specs on these cars, 
sorry. Drove one ('82?) very briefly in Switzerland in 1985, It was awesome, 
red with black interior, owner (my girlfriend's cousin) spoke English slightly 
better than I speak German, which is not much...so no accurate info. Suffice 
to say, pretty fun buggy to drive in the Alps....I think the non US cars had 
more power.

1986    Turbo reintroduced in US,   still has 4 speed tranny,  this is one I 
have driven a little, liked it but I thought it was a little too tail happy 
for my taste, but what a rush to drive...I think it had like 275 horses, and 
went 0-60 in less than 5 secs. This is the black car that was wrecked with my 
friend in it, he was killed.    :-(

1989   now has 5 speed tranny.  295 hp, I think, and handles better due to 
chassis tweaks.

1990   once again, no Turbo sold in US.  No idea why....?

1991-92   now called 911 Turbo, still 3.3 liter, but faster and more refined. 
Don't know specs.

1993  gets 3.6 liter finally, like rest of 911 line. Has like 360 hp I think.  
 Drove one at dealer, he would not let me really open her up, but still,    
Wow...!!

1996  This is THE ONE, kids... Twin Turbo, 400 horses, all wheel drive (yes!) 
and 6 speed trans. I have asked Santa for one, wish me luck....


Well, Ken that is all I know. Hopefully other more knowledgable types will see 
this post and fill in the gaps, and correct errors. I just have my old 
faithful 3 liter '81 SC, but I love her... Maybe some day I will grow up and 
get a Turbo....but I would probably still keep the SC, we are family after 13 
years, haha.      Warren.

What years did Porsche produce the 930 series and are they as reliable as
the "regular" 911's?  TIA.
