....to ever live was Porsche. My love of his cars began when I was a
teenager and read that he could do with four cylinders (by skillful design
of powertrain) what others needed six or eight to do .

This question is ill-posed. Hitler (or his staff) came up with the idea of
a "peoples car" that everyone could buy and would be reliable, cheap
transportation. He called on Porsche to design it (of course). BTW, the
madman's staff was afraid Hitler would have Porsche imprisoned or worse
because Porsche would not remove his hat in Hitlers presence.

>Another trick question, true or false:
>Ferdinand Porsche received his doctorate from Rensselaer Polytechnique
>>Institute.

RPI wishes.
