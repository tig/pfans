More trivial fodder:

From Comptom's Living Encylopedia:

Nicolas Cugnot of France built a three-wheeled steam-powered artillery
carriage in 1769. This was probably the first automotive vehicle. 

Steam carriages were produced in England during the late 18th and early
19th centuries. In 1786 William Murdock built a three-wheeled steam-driven
wagon. Richard Trevithick produced several steam carriages in the early
1800s. Steam-driven carriages, built and operated by Goldsworthy Gurney
and by Walter Hancock, transported passengers in the London area during
this same period. Hancock's "steam bus," built in 1832, was in regular
service between London and Paddington.

Oliver Evans built the first steam-powered motor vehicle in the United
States in 1805. A combination dredge and flatboat, it operated on land and
water. Richard Dudgeon's road engine of 1867 could carry ten passengers. 
It resembled a farm tractor.
