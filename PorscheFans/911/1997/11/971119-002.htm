Hi Juha,

You asked about the difference in the temperature sensor on 3.2 L motors.

Sorry for the delayed response.  I, like you, have the one wire sensor that
only transmits the resistance value relative to the body and engine ground.
 The DME wiring harness has two wires, as you observed.  The new two-wire
sensor is supposedly better because the resistance value is relative to the
two wires.

Does this make sense?

I've been watching mine carefully and at the first sign of a problem I
check the resistance values (3000 ohms cold, 150-200 ohms hot).  The two
wire sensor is more reliable either because it doesn't break, or because it
eliminates the need for the DME to check the value relative to the engine
ground.  Sounds like a good time to replace it while you've got the engine
out.

Let me know if you have more questions.
