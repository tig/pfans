I'm enjoying the good-natured debate on pressures.  BFG does recommend
1psi for every 100lbs of car weight, but I'd use that only as a last resort.

Having almost all of my BFG R1 experience on a track, I competed in
my first autocross a couple of weeks ago.  IMHO, pressures that work
good on a track are too high for autocross.  During my runs, I couldn't
even get the R1s to heat up at all using my normal 28/30 psi or so.

I'd bet that 24/27 would be too low for the track on anything that weighed
over 2500 lbs or so.  Just a guess.

Also, FWIW, after doing track events for years and just doing my first
autocross a couple of weeks ago, I think I'll stick to the track - much
more fun, IMHO.
