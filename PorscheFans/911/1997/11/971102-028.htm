Hi,

I don't want to start a torrent here, but, like some others, I've
been forcibly switched to digest mode, which I find very inconvenient
and distasteful.  If anyone should be curious about why I don't like this, 
email me privately; doesn't seem like the right fodder for this discussion.
It's clear from some of the dialogue in the lists (seeing a question and an 
answer in the same digest) that not everyone has been switched to digest
mode.  

	Question #1: Anybody have any idea how to assess how 
	many people who would like to be on regular distribution have 
	been forced into digest mode (without requiring a response from
	each subscriber, which would get 1800 or so responses into the
distribution)?

I've emailed Jim with questions about this, got the computer-generated
form-email, but nothing from Jim.  As when we were earlier having
problems, he seems especially incommunicative.

	Question #2: Anybody know Jim personally, so that you
	might prod him to answer some of these questions and
	keep us all better informed?
