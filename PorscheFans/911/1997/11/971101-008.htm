Please again forgive my ignorance if I am wrong, but it sounds like your
starter solenoid is going.  My Supra experienced this earlier this year.
Your symptoms sound just like the ones on my car (except it never started)
and the problem just appeared one day.  If you get the car started and
warmed up, then turn it off, it almost always starts just fine while warm,
but problems return when cold again.
