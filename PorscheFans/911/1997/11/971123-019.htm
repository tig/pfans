mmmmm, I do love crow done to a golden brown with a nice Techron glaze.  To
all those who suggested running a bottle of the stuff through my tank, I
salute you!  After 5-10 miles of driving, it started pulling like a train
and I had my old friend back.  Talk about a cheap, easy fix.  Six bucks and
a little driving did wonders.  The good thing about all the time I spent is
that I've got a fresh set of plugs in and a lot more confidence in my own
ability to work on the car.  Not ready for engine rebuilds yet, but I'll
get there.

Some observations:  911 spark plugs are a bitch to change no matter how you
tackle it, and the single best tool for the job was the Porsche tool
provided right in the toolkit (yes, a lot of you were right about that too
- thanks!).  If you've got a/c, the passenger side is the worst, and
incidentally, I wasn't able to lay the compressor on the fender like some
suggested.  The freon hoses simply weren't long enough, maybe because I've
got the rotary-style compressor and when it was installed the hoses were
shortened.

After getting LOTS of suggestions on changing the plugs, here's how I did
it for those who might want to know.  I used a u-jointed deep socket with
the rubber grommet removed and a 4-inch extension to break the plug loose.
With the grommet removed, the socket came right out of the recess without
dropping off.  Then I used the Porsche tool to finish twirling out the plug
and remove it.  Installing the new plug was exactly the reverse.

My #6 plug was black with carbon deposits which, as someone pointed out,
was indicative of a rich mixture, or more accurately in my case, an
uncombustable mixture.  I had a clogged injector that sputtered at low rpm
and got enough fuel in at high rpm to burn.  One bottle of Techron later
and things were back to smooth.

So thanks to everyone.  I'd never gotten there without your help.  Love
this list!
