>The spark plug socket invariably gets stuck on the plug because the
friction of the rubber plug 'grabber' inside the socket is greater than
the
resistance of the little button that holds the socket and the extension
together.  When you attempt to pull the socket and extension out of the
hole, the extension separates from the socket instead of the socket from
the plug.  Now you have the socket buried inside the plug hole & some
ingenuity & pesistence is usually required to fish it out.
Obviously the objective is to prevent the socket and extension from
separating.  The answer:  wrap the joint with some masking tape, or
maybe even some of that roll of duct tape you have laying around the

Uh uh. I went to Sears and bought a set of extensions that have locks on
'em. The little detent ball on the end of these extensions is spring
loaded like normal, but with a very heavy spring which is connected to a
small button a half inch up the extension... once you load a socket onto
these extensions, you can't get the socket off unless you push on the
small button at the same time. I knew of them before but didn't bother
buying one till i had to change plugs on my 911. A bit pricey... $25? or
so for a set of 3... i only needed one but they didn't sell them
separately.
