Fred, thanks for the reply. I was expecting some flaming arrows through the 
window... 
	As I have only a relatively mundane SC myself, you perhaps presume I have 
little idea of which I  speak concerning 930's. Maybe you are right, and I 
should sit down and shut up. 
	I have, after all, only driven three 930's, and I must concur, they were 
indeed deceptively docile around town at low speed and part throttle. However, 
when I opened them up, the acceleration was truly impressive, and I have owned 
several pretty powerful American "muscle" cars. That is one facet of the 930's 
beauty, that it can be so easy to drive in town, and yet so awesome when one 
hits the highway or track. 
	When I first drove a 930, many years ago, I foolishly let off the gas in a 
moderate turn, and experienced rear end lift and twitch out to the side at a 
much greater rate than I ever remember to have been the case with my old 3 
liter SC (and it was not like I didn't know any better). Did manage to recover 
composure of car and myself, however, to the great relief of the owner, who 
was sitting next to me,  visibly blanched! As I darn near wrecked my SC in '85 
when I first got her, pirouetting gracefully, wide eyed and white knuckled, 
into a nice soft hedge, I am simply figuring that a 930 as a first ever rear 
engine beastie seems a possible recipe for disaster. I was going about 45 in 
my SC at the time, if she had been a 930, maybe my speed would have been more 
like 75? Then I likely would not be here spouting off today (possible good 
thing...).
	Over the years, I have seen four badly wrecked Turbos at my local Pcar 
garage, 2 were clearly totaled. I was told a couple of these were cars that 
had been bought by "rich kids with no previous 911 experience". I knew a very 
fine fellow who was killed some years ago when he let his younger brother take 
the wheel of his 930,  the brother never having driven a 911 before, as I 
recall. So, tho' I have never owned a 930, I have skillfully managed to spin 
out my rather pedestrian normally aspirated 911. But maybe I am a particularly 
lame driver.... ;-) 
	I  think an awareness of possible dangers is a good and responsible thing for 
the Pfans list to promulgate. I still believe that the Turbos, most 
particularly the older ones which lack the newer model's chassis refinements, 
have distinctly lethal potential in overly exuberant and inexperienced hands.  
My late Dad, a WW2 fighter pilot, and a great lover of fast machinery, said, 
"There are plenty of wild and crazy young pilots, but no wild and crazy older 
ones...". All this being said, if I could have afforded it, I would have 
bought a 930 years ago!  Fred, I envy you.  'Nuff said.        
---Boring Old Fogie, "Preacher" Warren, climbing back down form his soap box, 
to a chorus of "Siddown and Shuddup!" from the Pfans.....

I saw your post about a 930 as a first car.  My first
Porsche is a 930.  I had heard the same stories about rear
engined cars and all that and it worried me a bit.  In
reality, it is not like that at all.  On the street (if you
are driving normally) you will never know the difference. 
It is only when you corner on the edge of traction and back
off will you spin.  I have taken my car to the track and
   <snip>
Also, it is not all that easy to break the wheels loose with
a 930 (or any turbo).  If you are not on the boost you have
the lag of the turbo to deal with and I would like to see
somebody catch rubber in 3rd or 4th.  A corvette has much
more torque and can do it a lot easier.  A recent 911 is
actually easier to drive becuase the power curve is much
flatter and you can pull thru a greater RPM range very well. 
Of course there is no substitute for what happens at 3000
RPM in a 930!
