"...Now I discovered that 965 was the

factory number for the water cooled (a la 962C), 4WD, twin turbo, 959

styled that professor Bott was designing as substitute for the 930 in 1989.

Since she was to expensive and professor Bott retired, they decided to

change their mind and go for a 964 C2 with 3.3 lt , K27/2 and K-jetronic.

Do any of you know more about the 965 and her prototypes?"

Aldo-
	There is a picture, and a brief description of Project 965 in "Porsche 911,
Forever Young" by Tobias Aichele. It was indeed twin turbo, with Motronic
engine management. Output was 360hp. Bodywork was VERY 959, but what's
interesting is that it doesn't look like Porsche disguised the car too much,
instead, they put a decal on the back, something like "EPC Tuning". I guess
they figured people would think it was an aftermarket conversion instead of a
mule. Good book, too.
