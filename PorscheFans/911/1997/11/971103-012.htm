Hi Dave,
I picked up a '69 911T Targa in the same condition as yours and have =
been happy with it. It has required
an engine overhaul which cost approximately $5K. I did the =
disassembly/assembly work myself. Bruce=20
Anderson's book on performance improvements is highly recommended for =
options on increasing HP.
I upgraded to 2.2L S pistons and cylinders, 2.2L T heads that were =
ported, counterweighted crank, and=20
"E" grind cam. German Precision provided the sourcing for these parts as =
well as machined piston=20
squirters and an oil bypass modification into the engine block. These =
changes along with a few=20
other modifications can provide the HP you require and are worth your =
musing if you are going to=20
overhaul the engine anyway... ;)   Beware that this type of work is not =
for those that seek instant
gradification.  If you would like more details please e-mail.=20
As you know, this vintage targa is subject to torsional chassis =
twisting. A quick check for this is
to remove the targa top and find the holes for the four locating pins =
(two in the front windsheild hoop=20
and two in the back hoop). Measure diagonally from front to back, that =
is, front left to the back right, and=20
visa versa. Compare these two measurements and if they differ by more =
than 3/8 inch, investigate.
Choose carefully, the car you are considering can be quite rewarding.
