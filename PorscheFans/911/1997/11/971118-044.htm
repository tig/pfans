  Coleman,

The tires on my C4 (P700's) also wear 50%/80% front and rear with mostly
street driving :-) and 1-2 DE events per year.   Asking around this
seems normal for a 964.  I am also running 17" C2T 7"/8" wheels. With
the amount of understeer from the 205's in the front, I'm feeling less
guilty about chucking them when the 255's go.  What front and rear sizes
are you running and are you satisfied with the balance?  Any clearance
problems?  I've already rolled the front wheel wells and installed the
steering limiters.


No specific experience,on replacing the solenoid. However I have done
some work with the brake system.  If you decide to do this repair
yourself; here are a few tips: be aware that the pressure at the booster
is 180 Bar (2600+psi) and even relieving the pressure at the
accumulator, as recommended, could be tricky to do safely and cleanly
(brake fluid looks terrible on P-car paint):^o  You may be able to
reduce the pressure by disconnecting the power to the pump and pumping
the brakes (my old Audi required this procedure, took about 30 pumps to
lose assist).  Can't say what a C4 would take.  Bleeding air out of all
the components is a long procedure compared to "normal"  brake systems
but once you get used to the high pressure and plugging the electric
pump, it's not to complex.  To finish you'll need a Bosch 9288 "Hammer"
to electronically open and close the lock cylinders in the AWD system to
bleed the remaining air out.  I've always found this to be the real
problem (not having a 9288 and still looking for a replacement).

I would suggest not compromising the AWD, the brake system and your
safety for $200.  You might be able to figure out the correct
composition of the o-ring, viton, butyl, teflon encap, etc. but guess
wrong and ...Just my $.02. Good Luck
