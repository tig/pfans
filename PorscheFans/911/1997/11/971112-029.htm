Brad Phillips -

You asked about transmission problems involved in putting a later engine
in your early 2.0 liter 911.

The general word seems to be that as long as you don't do drag racing
starts you should be able to put quite a bit more power through the 901
transmission than the 2 liters did.  There are several strength issues. 
The one you can only cure with your driving style is first gear.  It is
located on the end of a shaft which has no outboard support bearing so
it is in single shear.  Getting too frisky in first can lead to breaking off this
shaft.  The 915 transmission puts 5th gear out here and first "inside"
where it has better support, and since 5th demultiplies rather than
multiplies the engine torque, the problem can't happen. 

Also, it appears that the intermediate plate section of the tranny housing
is not as strong as it might be if your tranny has a magnesium case (as a
'68, it may still have an aluminum case).  This can be solved, if necessary
as it is not cheap, by purchasing a replacement aluminum intermediate
plate from the aftermarket suppliers like Automotion (this means
disassembling much of your transmission, of course).

However, 901 transmissions are used a lot in racing, including by people
using hopped up 300 hp 2.9 liter engines in SCCA GT2 914-6s.  You don't
hear them moaning about having to replace expensive shafts all the time,
so as long as you don't try to launch the car drag race style in first all is
probably well.  The factory ran 220 hp from its racing 2 liters through
these boxes also.  That's as much as you can expect (though with much
more torque down low) from a stock 3.2.

There is another issue, though, and that is clutch compatibility.  The 901
is a push pressure plate clutch (the throwout bearing is pushed toward
the flwheel to release the spring pressure on the pressure plate), while
the 915 goes the other way - the clutch fork pulls the TOB back toward
the transmission to release the pressure.  This isn't a problem if you put
in a 2.7 engine, as you can simply use an earlier 901 style flywheel  (the
one on your car, for instance) which is made for this push pressure
plate - it will bolt right up to the 2.7 crank.  However, the flywheel bolt
pattern on the crank changed with the 3.0.  And the 3.0s and 3.2s were
all set up for the 915 (and later the G50), and you can't just bolt a 901
pressure plate onto them.  If you have an opportunity to look at the parts
you'd see why instantly.

You could probably have a machinist make you a flywheel with a late
style bolt pattern and an early style pressure plate attachment (with ring
gear machined into the flywheel) or otherwise somehow cobble
something together.  But my guess is it would be cheaper or at least a
wash if you just purchased a used 915 and put that in.  You need to
purchase a (used) different shift lever and shift tower, and need to
clearance just a little bit the rear seat sheet metal on the left side from
underneath with a ball peen hammer or some other method.  You will
probably need to replace your clutch cable and Bourdon tube.  But it is
not a big deal.

Or, go with a 2.7.  They've gotten a bad rap.  They do have their
problems, but by and large these problems can be fixed, and you'll have
a lot more torque than your 2.0T.  If you can wrangle some used Weber
40s, you could use those and maybe further simplify the conversion a
bit.

I've probably overlooked something here, as there are 914s running
around with 3 liters in them, and I am not sure they all have converted to
the 915.  If so, the list will doubtless point out the error of my ways.
