Folks,
Thanks for the excellent responses (and two phone calls) that I received
after my question about the oil pressure and OEL on my car. However, as
I am still a newbie I will keep the Q's coming.
This week, my 78 911 SC started a clunking in the rear. This clunk
(thud) is more noticeable on bad roads as the car rolls forward, but on
a nice even road the noise is not audible. However, putting weight on
the bumper will produce that sound. First mechanic I took it to has
diagnosed it as a bad shock, a more reputable mechanic said on the phone
that it is probably a sway bar. In any case, I want to be ready for the
worst so,
Q1) If I buy new shocks for the rear, what kind should I be looking at,
Bilsteins or Koni (He offered me KYB's at $65/each)
Q2) How bad is it to drive the car in it's current condition?
That's all for now. Thanks again for being so supportive.
