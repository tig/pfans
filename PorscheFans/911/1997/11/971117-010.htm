Hello all,
	As a new person to the list I like what I have seen so far. There seems =
to be an incredible amount of information flowing through here. I have a =
couple of questions that I'm sure have been answered at one time but =
I'll ask anyway. My 81 SC does not want to idle if I have the AC on. =
When I come to a stop and put the clutch in there is a good chance it =
will stall. If it doesn't then engine speed will come back up to 850. If =
I push the gas pedal and bring the speed up while stopped, it will most =
likely stall. I have no problems driving. There is plenty of power and I =
don't really notice that the AC is running. Any ideas?
	I also noticed some conversation about shifting problems. I also =
experience problems going into second gear from first when I am doing =
high rpm's. If I double clutch it it works or if I shift a lower rpm's =
it works most of the time. There are times when it feels like something =
is going to break if I try to shift and other times it slides right in. =
I NEVER force it. Any ideas?
	Also, what does SC stand for? Is there a place to get archives of this =
group?

Thanks in advance.
