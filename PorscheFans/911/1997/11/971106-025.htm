Mike,
 First off, thank you very much for responding!
>> 1. ... Could the

>>   or there other factors involved I should be aware of?

>it could be (after having debugged similar things with mine):
>
>	- rear toe difference
>	- corner weight imbalance
>	- uneven tire wear on front, rear, or all
I _do_ have my corner weights a bit off now that you
mention it. About 50 lbs off (from ideal) in the front when
I checked them at some scales at the track.


>> 2. A racer friend drove my car and another friends stock
>>   '79 SC and noted that my car didn't "turn in" very well. 
>>   Is this an alignment issue or a question of not getting 
>>   enough "stick" in the front.

>My guess: either too much front toe-in for the conditions you're describing
>(it's a tradeoff of better turn-in vs. straight-line stability), or tires
that

my
>Michelin XGT-Z with Firestone SZ-50 and the handling was *substantially*
>improved -- including much better steering response.
The SC had old P7's and mine has D40M2's still..

>> 3. I recently purchased one of those Smartproducts wrenches
>>   for adjusting the rear ride height. Has anyone else  used one 
>>   with any success?

>Absolutely YES!  I spent a few weekends tuning the rear ride height and
corner
>balance.  The first weekend was w/o the wrench and I'd never do that again:
it
>is hard to loosen and tighten the front bolt (of the two adjustment bolts)
at
>all without it, let alone develop the torque needed to get it to spec, and
it
>lets you do very well controlled adjustments on the eccentric bolt (the rear
of
>the two).  The wrench pays for itself in 10 minutes if you're going to do a
few
>ride height iterations.
Some friends and I did  a friend's car and the wrench spread so much that
I sent it back.  Turning the eccentric took a lot of force under some
conditions.
It seemed like we were working against the force of the torsion bar.  I don't
know if they didn't heat treat it correctly (or at all) or if we shouldn't
have
had to pull on it as hard as we did. 

 thanx again,
  Chris
