Pfans:
With my CIS sorted out to the point of decent running,  the trans rework
done, and my electrical gremlins held at bay (at least for the moment)
I'm left with one more problem before I put my 911 away.  That being
sooty plugs.  To set the mixture I lean it until it starts to run rough
and the turn it back rich to smooth it out plus a fraction.  The car
starts fine, runs strong but both the smell of the exhaust and the look
of the plugs suggests a very rich running engine not to mention my
watering eyes if I stand behind it for long.   Everything in the
ignition is new plus new injectors.  The car is SSI equipped and no
longer has the air pump with the heads reworked to seal the holes. Most
driving unfortunately is low speed stop and go traffic.  It was
suggested to me that I should try a hotter plug.  I currently have new
Bosch platinum 5's and would go to 8's or to test it out an equivalent
NGK for an experiment as they a cheap and easy to get.  Anyone else have
something similar??  Am I chasing dragons and should maybe let it be??
Opinions encouraged.  TIA
