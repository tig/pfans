Well I did it. I am now the proud owner of a 1983 911SC Targa (Euro). If
the past 1 1/2 weeks are any indication, I am in love. I just hope I
have as mych fun over the next 2-3 years. It is my plan to use it as my
daily driver, then get a newer one if all works out. 

Because I am a novice, I have same questions that may seem quite stupid.
Please bare with me. Note, I am leaving the tech/mech stuff to my
mechanic. The rest is up to me.

	1. How does the heater/AC contols work? The manual is no help.
	   After sveral hours, I still can't completely figure it out.

	2. Targe top is in good shape. However the foam headliner is           
almost comletely gone. I am think of order a headliner replace 	from
automotion or World Uphostery ($25). Does any have any        
experience?	

	3. Of course the Targa leaks. Actually only very small           
occasional drip at the front corner of the doors. It appears to me to be
the seals (front & one side window). Is there any quick or short term
fix, short of replaing the seals ($$)?

	4. What about treatment for the external Traga Top? 

	5.What octane gas?

Thank you for any help. It is appreciated.
