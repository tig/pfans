The brakes in my 87 Carrera feel spongy. Actually, I'm not sure that's the
word I should be using, but the symptoms are that when pushing the pedal
softly (limo driver stopping style) it goes down until it gets stopped by
something (probably inside the master cylinder; it's not the floor or
something in the way of the pedal), and the car doesn't brake very hard (in
other words, with the pedal all the way down the car is still going if the
original speed was fast enough), but when giving the pedal a stab it feels
a lot harder and even pushing real hard it does not get stopped. If the
engine is off then the pedal feels hard no matter how I press it. I
recently replaced the pads and fluid and turned the rotors and that didn't
help. I used to have the exact same problem with my previous 77 S and I
replaced the master cylinder and the mechanics ended up telling me that
that was normal. I recently read about rubber hoses expanding and
potentially creating this situation, but if that was the case why would the
brakes work fine when stabbing the pedal?

Any ideas?


Thanks,

Gabriel
