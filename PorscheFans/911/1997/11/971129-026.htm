This is a repeat posting, as I got no replies with the first try last month...

Subject: 	Number of All Leather 911 SC's?

Does anyone know of the percentage of 911 SC's that were produced with the 
optional complete Full Leather interior? It was an expensive option at the 
time. 
	
	By "Full Leather", I mean the dash is covered in leather, the door panels, 
the console has leather trim, door pockets rimmed in leather, rear package 
shelf,  etc. Some cars have some leather on the seats but not elsewhere, I 
notice; I don't mean this type of partial leather interior. 
	I have personally guessed that the full leather cars number  less than a 
fifth of those I have seen over the years, but this is a most informally 
researched figure. Anyone have actual data on this? Later 911's seem to have 
had a higher percentage of leather covered cars as the prices have risen on 
the line overall. Some of the recent top flight cars have leather on 
practically everything, it seems; I think this is overkill myself.
	Any help out there on this one? 
 81 SC with full leather interior, in pretty nice shape..  thanks     Warren.
