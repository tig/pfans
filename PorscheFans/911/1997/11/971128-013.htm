Hello,

I've been reading your comments about the 996 styling and can agree with
almost all of you.  Before leaving for Germany, there were no final
pictures of the car published, so I only had the ugly flat-black shots
to go by in my search for finding a real-life specimen while in the
fatherland.

To my astonishment, at Weissach's customer centre, there were quite
a few 996's around.  We got to see one up close in the Customer Centre's
parking lot (we had to leave our cameras at the very nice gatekeeper)
and more importantly, we got to hear a 996 at full bore leaving one of
the many Porsche buildings (one of the ones near the Museum).

At first look, the 996 does not look so hot, where are the fat fenders?
Heck, even my 944T has bigger fenders.  Where is the famous dash?
All of these concerns were muted when the roar of the new watercooled
engine turned into a scream as the 996 bounced off it's limiter down
the street.  WOW, how did they take the famous air cooled noise,
duplicate it at low speeds and then create a Ferrari-like scream at
the top end?  Just the noise was enough to make me want to test drive
one really badly.

Next major change in my attitude came when a customer pulled up in
a 993 and parked it next to the new 996 in the lot.  As beautiful as
the 993 is, the 996 just looked fresher and newer.  When seen alone,
it may not look that impressive, but compared to the bulky, odd looking
993 with it's straight up windshield, the 996 looked smooth and clean.

In the pictures, you can't see how the new 996 reflects light, one of
the most impressive features of fenders is the way they reflect light.
The 996 will not dissapoint you when seen in person.

Personally, the best iteration in my young life I've seen of the 911
is the 993 body style, it just does something for me, but if money
were almost no object, I would buy a 1994 911 3.6 Turbo and turn my
89 944T into a track car!

All I can say is, yes the nose looks a bit long, yes the tail doesn't have
the same presence, but when you hear that motor roar (it looked pretty
fast too), you'll forget about what came before.

PS - I think the best dash Porsche ever created is in the later 944's.  Clean,
     simple, easy to use, a bit quarky, just perfect for a sports car.  I
     hate big overhangs on the dash and I'll admit, the 996 dash will take
     some getting used to.
