OOPS!    My sincere apologies for my rude and unjust accusation against Mr. 
Bill..... I am indeed a novice on the list (2 months), if not to 
Porschephilia.  I figured, immediately after I fired that one off, that it was 
probably some sort of technical glitch, but one can't recall Email,.....I 
stand corrected, humbled, and quite contrite. Please, good kind sirs, forgive 
a poor ignorant lout; I will endeavor to ensure brain is engaged before 
putting mouth in gear...... W.    :-(

Warren,

Apparently you are new around here.  His mistake was that he
posted to three lists at once.  He is not reposting.  Bugs in the
software that power the lists are doing the reposting.  Repeat:
he is not doing this posting and he cannot stop it.  Please
back off.  The problem will apparently go away when a week goes
by or the listmeister takes action.
