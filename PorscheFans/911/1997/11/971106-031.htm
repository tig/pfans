Larry:

Actually, I personally find the "double-blip" method much easier
than the "single-blip" method, especially with a transmission (like
the 901 in my car) whose gear-to-gear shift speeds are inconsistent
(e.g., the 4th-to-3rd shift is slower than the 3rd-to-2nd, if for no
other reason than the fact that I'm terrified of accidentally
downshifting from 4th into 1st).

If you "double blip", you can shift (almost) as slowly as you like...
So you can start practicing with slow shifts and gradually improve
your shifting speed.  The "single-blip" method's much harder to
learn, since it's impossible to separate it into individual steps
which can each be performed slowly and distinctly.
