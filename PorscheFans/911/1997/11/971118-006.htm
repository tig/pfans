I suppose I could get testy about this statement, actually I learned much of
what I know from the football coach whom also taught my junior high science
class. He gave me such nuggets as "cut and paste," which leads me to point
out the implications this thread has on torsional spring rate, creep,
microfractures, and major failure on the targa chassis (or any chassis for
that matter).

It would seem that if the sag is uniform in all the torsion bars that ride
height is lowered, a very desirable result judging from all who actively
change suspension geometry to achieve this. I have difficulty attributing
sagging or "setting" to simple deformation of the crystal lattice without
the formation of microcrystaline fractures. (Sounds like Materials 101
again, eh Walt) Of course, a major fracture occurs with a series of
microcrystaline fractures. This is facilitated by focused stress in the case
of surface irregularities or singularities. Hence:

This begs elucidation from you knowledgeable mech. engineers out there.

Also curious.
