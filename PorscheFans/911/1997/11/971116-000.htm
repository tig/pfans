To clarify my possibly muddy posts recently:
	Sorry to rattle on here, but I had gotten some bizarre replies recently, and 
so reread some of my recent orations, and thought they were maybe somewhat 
muddled, so: 
	My completely stock 3 liter SC generally has excellent torque band width, 
with good drivability around town at most normal engine/vehicle speeds. Idles 
smoothly at around 850 warm, and 11-1300 while warming up. 
	The car, however,  does not like to be "lugged" in high gears at low rpm's, 
and I do not do that. In my understanding, the tranny is there to adjust 
engine speed to road speed, in order to to provide for optimum torque, due to 
the fact that 911's have a non linear torque curve... so I attempt to operate 
car generally as designed. I try to avoid experimentation with odd engine/road 
speed combinations in order to achieve "neat sound effects". Maybe some one 
else has different experience or ideas about how to drive, which is fine with 
me...just please don't do it in my car! 
	On the earlier engines with smaller displacement, my experience has been that 
they like high rpm's and have a relatively narrow rpm band for decent torque, 
such as 3500 to 5500 rpm's. These nifty little motors have seemed happiest at 
engine speeds above 3000, in my limited experience. The major improvement of 
the 3 liter motors, I think, was a wider torque band, with drivability more in 
line with the norm for many cars. Some limited torque is available down to 
around 2000, which can be handy in traffic, but torque below this is weak, on 
my car at least. One fellow indicated to me that his SC would drive about 
happily at 1400 or so rpms, but mine does not like that. Perhaps my car is 
unusual? My SC seems to be pretty happy at most reasonable engine/road speed 
combinations, although the torque really gets fun above 3500, as with the 
earlier motors. That is why, when I got my 3 liter SC many years ago, I liked 
it well enough to keep it so long. 
	However, the 3 liter is not a big block V8, so torque is not humongous at low 
speed. So I have generally found my engine would rather not be poodled around 
at 1500 rpm's, so I don't do it... but that is just my personally feeling and 
driving style. I would rather drive my 911 fast rather than slowly ("sorry 
officer, I think my speedometer must be out of calibration"....). 
	But I have had American V8's that would cheerfully drag a 4500 pound hulk 
around at an idle speed of 500 rpms. Eight pistons and 300+ cubic inches of 
displacement are likely a help here, I figure, not to mention the hydraulic 
coupling of an automatic transmission....but some V8's with hot cams will not 
idle smoothly at all...
	As a related point, I recently drove a late model RX-7 Convertible,  with the 
rotary Wankel engine. I had forgotten just how amazing the virtually flat 
torque curve of a Wankel is, as it just never stops pulling. I kept expecting 
the car to "tell me", through the seat of my pants, that it was time to 
upshift, but it just kept on accelerating. I, to my embarrassment, kept it in 
third until the audible redline alarm buzzed at me, much to the annoyance of 
the car's owner, who was sitting beside me...The Mazda is surely no Porsche, 
but what a neat little package. 
	By the way, thanks to all for the info on 901 and 915 trannies!
	
	I will sit down and shut up for a while now, I think.  ;-)              W.
