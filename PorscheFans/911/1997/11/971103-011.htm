Yes, you need better oil cooling for long life of your engine.
If you read Bruce's book, you know 250 is 'too damn hot'.
I've experienced the same in my car and you still want to
run synthetic because dino oil starts breaking down before
synthetic.   You may want to try ducting more air to the cooler
and replacing the hoop cooler with a real cooler.  I decided to
go for maximum cooling with a front spoiler/cooler.
You can try removing the headlight bucket which is good for at
least 20deg.

You could, larger is better but it's not cheap.  Not sure what
problem you're trying to solve.

Yes, the thermostat only opens up after the oil reaches operating temp of
180deg.  In colder weather and on the street, you want the engine to heat
up quickly bypassing the oil cooler if the thermostat works correctly.

Hope this helps.
