Brian,    your tale of pursuit of your (whale) tail reminds me of a comment 
made by a friend some years ago after he had invested (one does not just buy) 
in a 930. He ruefully said he had hoped to attract some lovely ladies with his 
shiny red Turbo, but that the folks most interested in it appeared to be the 
Florida Highway Patrol. He said an FHP cruiser had doggedly trailed him for 30 
miles, hanging about five cars back, evidently in the hope that my friend 
would suddenly feel the need to test for Turbo lag. In this case, his Turbo 
indeed lagged at around 56 mph the whole way....until the Patrolman finally 
pulled alongside, looked over at him, and passed him by.  Warren.
