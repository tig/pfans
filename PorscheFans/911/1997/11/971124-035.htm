    Jim:

    Will you ever see another overpriced, possibly crash-damaged
    dial-a-boost 911, being sold by a dishonest salesman?

    Yeah, probably.

    Judging only from your description of the car and seller, I'd
    advise you to keep looking... This particular vehicle doesn't
    sound like a "dream car" to me.

    Of course, I could be wrong... So spend $100 or so on a
    pre-purchase inspection by a competent Porsche mechanic.  He'll
    tell you whether the car's worth buying.

> I could build one from an older 911,....

    No, you couldn't.

> ....but would it be the same?

    No.  If you want a 911 turbo, buy one; any effort to build-up a
    normally-aspirated earlier car into a clone of an '87 turbo will
    be futile.
