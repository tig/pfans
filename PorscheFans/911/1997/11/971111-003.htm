Are you out there list master? How about killing this thing now, as we
need to brace for what appears to be another onslaught on a new topic
from Kapil Luthra <kl4@stern.nyu.edu>, subject: car waxing, and by the

Gee, I wonder if you can use Zymol on black 951 sport seats since, after
all, I think they have better lateral support....?
