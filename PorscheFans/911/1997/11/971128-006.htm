As an engineer having significant experience in the research and
development of engines
I feel compelled to comment on the above remarks:

1) Engine designers make objective trade offs of fuel efficiency,
operability, performance, emissions, and reliability when designing an
engine.  If done properly
the engine is "optimized" within these design parameters.  Changing any one
of these parameters
necessarily implies a trade off of other parameters unless the original
designers did not
optimize the engine. Porsche spends a tremendous amount of time and effort
in their engine
development programs to optimize their designs so I doubt that a company
like Autothority can
simply step in and find significant "hidden horsepower" without some
commensurate trade-off in
other design parameters.

2) If a computer chip raises engine performance (horsepower and torque)
then BY DEFINITION
it puts more strain on the engine.  Mechanical parts (primarily moving)
such as connecting rods, wrist
pins, main crank bearings, you name it recieve more punishment.  Without
digressing into a detailed
discussion of high and low cycle fatigue, chips will impact the reliability
of the engine.  The question is
how much.

3) I highly doubt that a chip company like Autothority takes the time to
perform "accelerated cycle testing"
(tests I have done extensively) where the full life cycle of an engine is
tested in short period of time (starting/running/
stopping continuously for a period of 3-6 months) to characterize the
reliability impacts of their chips, this testing is
time consuming and expensive and typically only performed by the OEM
manufacturer.

In summary I can't comment specifically on the reliability impacts of a
chip but the more horsepower you get out
in all likelihood the lower the reliability of the engine.  An extreme
example is my brother in law who put two chips
in his Audi S4, one for the main DME and the other for the wastegate on the
turbocharger.  He had burned pistons
and expensive repairs within months.
