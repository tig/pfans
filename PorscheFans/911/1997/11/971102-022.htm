Let's Get Physical

             BY DAVE BARRY

             I turned 50, which is really not
             so old. A lot of very famous
             people accomplished great
             things after 50. For example, it
             was during the post-50 phase
             of his life that the brilliant
             physicist Albert Einstein
             produced the vast majority of
             his drool.

             But still, when you're 50, you're
             definitely ``getting up there,'' so
             I decided I'd better go in for my
             annual physical examination,
             which is something I do
             approximately every seven to
             nine years. I keep my physicals spaced out because my doctor, Curt, who is
             ordinarily a terrific guy, has a tendency to put on a scary rubber glove and make
             sudden lunges at my personal region.

             Also Curt has some ladies who work with him -- and again, these are charming
             people -- who belong to some kind of Druid-style cult that has very strict beliefs
             under which they are not allowed to let you leave the office with any of your blood.
             They get you in a chair and distract you with charming conversation while they
             subtly take your arm and insert a needle attached to a long tube that goes outside
             to a 50,000-gallon tanker truck with a big sign that says ``BLOOD.'' When they're
             done draining you, they don't even have to open the door to let you out; they just
             slide you under it.

             Somehow I got through my physical OK. But then, about a week later, Curt was
             working late one night at his office -- perhaps going through the Official Catalog Of
             Supplies For Doctor's Offices, which lists needles in sizes ranging all the way from
             Extra Large to Harpoon, as well as an extensive selection of pre-1992 magazines
             with the last page of every article torn out -- and he happened to glance up at his
             framed copy of the Hippocratic oath. This is an oath that is named after an ancient
             Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who is considered the Father of Medicine because
             he invented the following phrases, without which modern medical care would be
             impossible:

             -- ``Do you have insurance?''

             -- ``We're going to have to run some tests.''

             -- ``You may experience some discomfort.''

             -- ``We're going to have to run some more tests.''

             -- ``The tests were inconclusive.''

             Anyway, Curt was looking at the Hippocratic oath, which all doctors are required
             to take, and he noticed the sentence that says:

             ``And I swear by my Lexus that if a person comes into my office for any reason,
             whether it be for a physical examination or simply to deliver the mail, I will find
             something medically wrong with that person.''

             And so Curt, realizing that if he let me get out of my physical scot-free, burly
             agents of the American Medical Association Ethics Unit would come and yank his
             stethoscope right out of his ears, called me and told me that the cholesterol level in
             my blood was a little high. I tried to argue that this was no longer my problem,
             since all my blood was in the possession of the Druid ladies, but Curt insisted that I
             had to change my dietary habits.

             To help me do this, Curt sent me some informative medical pamphlets that explain
             to the layperson, via cartoons, what cholesterol is. Technically, it is a little
             blob-shaped guy with buggy eyes and a big nose who goes running through your
             blood vessel, which is a tube going to your heart, which can be seen smiling in the
             background. Sometimes the blob guy gets stuck, causing him to get a grumpy
             expression and have a balloon come out of his mouth saying, ``I'M STUCK.'' If
             too many cholesterols get stuck, your blood vessel looks like a New York subway
             train at rush hour, and your heart gets a sad face, and surgeons have to go in there
             with a medical device originally developed by Roto-Rooter.

             To prevent this from happening, you need to be very careful about your diet, as
             follows:

             FOOD GROUPS YOU CANNOT EAT: Meat, milk, cheese, butter, desserts,
             processed foods, fried foods, foods with skins, restaurant foods, foods your mom
             made, foods from packages, foods shown in commercials, foods containing flavor,
             foods being carried around on trays at wedding receptions, appetizers, snacks,
             munchies, breakfast, lunch, dinner, take-out, drive-thru, piña coladas, any food
             with a phrase such as ``GOOD LUCK HERB!'' written on it in frosting.

             FOOD GROUPS YOU CAN EAT: Water (unsweetened), lowfat celery, wood
             chips.

             This diet has been difficult for me to follow. The worst part has been giving up
             cheese. I love cheese. I'm the kind of person who, merely while rummaging
             through the refrigerator to see what else is available, can easily gnaw his way
             through a hunk of cheddar the size of the late Sonny Liston. But I've been pretty
             good so far, and I'm hoping that my blood cholesterol will be a lot lower, if I ever
             develop blood again. Curt wants me to come back in and have it checked. He'll
             never take me alive.

My '69 911T is pretty finicky about what gas (always 92 octane) it likes.  In
Los Angeles, where I live, it runs the best on Texaco or Shell, with Unocal
and Chevron following behind.  For some reason, it does not run well at all
(occasional knocking and pinging) on Mobil or Arco.  However, whenever I visit
the Bay Area (San Francisco and environs), my car seems to run better on
Chevron.  I have no idea why this is.  I also note that this is a totally non-
scientific test and that I have not used either Mobil or Arco gas for over a
year (because of the results noted above).  I should also note that a neighbor
of mine who drives an '82 911SC swears by Chevron no matter where he is.
