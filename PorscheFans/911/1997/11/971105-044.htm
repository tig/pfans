Ken,

I found myself in just this situation last summer at a drivers-ed at
Mid-Ohio. I was carrying too much speed through the "carousel" and the
car
started to understeer. I maintained neutral throttle and held the turn
as
best I could. Luckily there was enough track so I didn't plow into
anything.
All I can really recommend is that you don't panic by lifting or
braking, and 
learn from your mistakes, I did.
