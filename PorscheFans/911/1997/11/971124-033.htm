To all:

Mike Piera suggested that there might be Japanese influence on the 996's
styling. 

This is not the case. The 996 was styled during the spring of 1992,
prior to the Boxster prototype being built. Some spy shot in magazines
of the time also showed pictures of the fiberglass 996 coupe proto as
well as the 993 test mules. 

What has happened at Porsche is that it still takes a coniderable time
to bring a new model to market, notwithstanding the hype about the
Japanese bringing "improved" processes to the manufacturing line. This
lag between concept and market lets competitors capture the same flavor
of the Porsche product line without as much risk. 

We are fortunate, however, that most competitors do not have the
corporate culture to produce a Porsche, and those that do produce
Ferraris, Aston Martins and Jaguars instead. Porsche owners are also
lucky that the General is content with producing Corvettes the way they
do. 

When you see the 996 in person, it is a very attractive car. It strikes
you in much the same vein as the 911 did in 1965 (For those of us old
enough to remember). Relax, it is a natural evolution of the Porsche
concept. The distingushed Professor would be very proud of this car. 

Just drive it, Mike. If you remember what your 911 did to the
competition when you competed, you will feel the competitive juices
flowing again. It looks different, but the spirit is there. Even more
so.

Have fun, Jim Pasha
