In reponse to Targa85@AOL.com, I have a 87 Targa which I bought new.  About 
six or seven years ago, the cruise control decided not to work off and on.  
Typically it would not work at all for thirty minutes or so and then it 
would work just fine....then if you turned off the engine and restarted it 
sometimes it would work...and sometimes you would have to wait the thrity 
minutes or so before it would work.

I mentioned it to the dealer off and on but their fixes never seemed to 
hold.

This summer when I had my 90,000 service done by the dealer where I bought 
it, they said they thought they fixed it...something about a sending unit 
(I am definitely not a techie).  It worked fine.....for about four months.  
Now, who knows?  Sometimes it works right off the bat, other 
times....thirty minutes later.

Anyone else had this problem?  suggestions?
