Has anyone run into this before, so I can determine a starting place to
look.

Lately my 75 targa has been producing a kind oflow pitched rattle sound
from the exaust with medium to heavy acceleration. Almost like a tinny
sound. It is very pronounced when cold gets better at 180 degrees so that
medium acceleration doesnt cause it but will always be present on heavier
acceleration.  Chain tensioners are upgrades and I do know that sound. 
Valves sound alright for adjustment when idling, but the rapping sound is
always present in some form of acceleration or another.

Just doesnt seem to have the same acceleration either.
No smokeing 
Has just shown a tendancy to stall out after 4+ hours of hard driving and
then coming up to a stop signal in a town RPM's drop out unless I have the
throtle advance set up

Gas Milage seems to be staying at the usual 20 in town 25 road.

When warm no sound while accelerating in first gear.

Most pronounced from 2800 to 3600 rpm

TIA for any and all ideas
