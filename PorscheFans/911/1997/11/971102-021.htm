The default position on the engine latch is supposed to be "open", in
that you need to tension the cable to pull the latch mechanism so that
it locks the hood down. If the cable breaks and everything works as it
is supposed to, the hood should pop open.
If this is not happening, I would offer the possible choices that: 1,
the cable is not broken but somehow stuck or jammed, if you can't pull
it all the way out of the car it probably isn't broken as all it is a
piece of piano wire which goes through a tube to the latch mechanism. No
linkage at all other than at the latch.

2. The latch  buggered up, and somehow stuck closed. Only suspicions
here are corrosion or old grease. Unlikely.

3. The cable is not really broken and the adjustment is such that it
can't pull the latch mechanism back far enough to open the hood. Answers
here are to pull harder, use the 2 person idea and hopefully yank it
open or to cut the wire and it should pop up

Good luck
