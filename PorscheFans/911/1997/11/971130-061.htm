A 200 page reference folder is becoming available that covers some 30
categories of products and services to Porsche enthusiasts -
accessories, body shops, books & videos, breakers and dismantlers,
cleaning and polishing, (UK) clubs, dealers, driver training, events,
insurance, magazines, memorabilia, practical advice on starting racing,
(UK) race championships and circuits, restorers, race preparers, tuning,
security, service shops, tyres and wheels. 

There is a 90-entry glossary and index. About 50 pages are used for
descriptions of every road car Porsche have built - from 356 to 996 -
with historical milestones, auto-biographs, buying tips and price
guides. An overview of the Porsche race cars is included. There is
advice on buying from dealers, advice on buying privately, a list of
pre-purchase inspection services,discussions about which oil and fuel to
use and advice on how to prepare and sell your Porsche.

Types of part are described from genuine Porsche through Porsche
original equipment to original equipment and used.

There are articles on Porsche's rear seating (not), the Porsche car face
and on spurning chrome.

It is a UK-based publication covering around 600 suppliers located
geographically and also listed alphabetically by category with full
contact details.

It is neither a coffee table glossy book nor a technical handbook. The
aimk is to provide a comprehensive description of the main aspects of
buying, owning, operating and selling a Porsche car and of all (UK)
suppliers of products and services likely to be needed by the Porsche
enthusiast at some time during their Porsche affair.

It deals primarily with Porsche ownership in the UK and doesn't cover
American specification Porsches in its history section. Nor does it list
non-UK suppliers of products and services (except in 1 or 2 minor
cases.) However the mass of general Porsche-related information may make
it worthwhile outside the UK in spite of this.

The price is 14.99 pounds sterling plus 2.95 pounds sterling postage &
packing in the UK, 4.50 pounds sterling elsewhere. 

E-mail me for further information.
