Greg:

Go to this place for some info on heating systems:   

http://macmyler.engr.ucf.edu/poor_mans_Porsche.html

The upper right lever in your 77 is only a 3 or 4 position switch designed
to control the fresh air blower motor which is integrated into the maze of
tubes and valves immediately behind the dash but accessible only from
the trunk after you remove the cardboard cover for this area.  The upper
left lever actually moves a flapper valve up in the maze to control the
fresh air.

On my car when I got it used this lever did not work because the cheesy
switch (not replaceable) attached to it had melted and burned its
contacts.  I simply replaced this with a nice rotary switch elsewhere on
the dash (a Porsche switch, to be sure, in a Porsche location).  but
perhaps yours has not burned out.  

The fresh air blower has nothing to do with heat.  You are going to have
to be the expert on what was done to plumb your aftermarket air
conditioning into the factory non-air system (or does it all just come out of
the add on console under the dash).  But none of this controls the hot air
blower which sat (and still should sit) on the left side top of your engine. 
That blower has only one speed, so it is either on or off.  Pulling up either
of the two red handled heat levers a little bit should turn it on via a switch
which is attached to each of them.  However, the handles also control
via a wire the valves which determine how much of the hot air from the
heat exchangers gets to the passenger compartment.  If you don't have
this heater blower motor on your engine you were shorted a bit on your
engine swap and should put one there along with its various hoses and
ducts.  You should have a control wire in your wiring loom.  Works
wonders. If the whole shebang is missing you may see some obviously
cobbled together stuff to move engine fan air from its duct on the left
rear of the engine shrouding into the heat exchangers (which was the
condition of my car when I got it also - the motor was burned out).

At least you don't have to wrestle with the "improved" heating systems
with automatic controls.  Count your blessings.
