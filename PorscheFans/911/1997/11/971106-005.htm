Well, let me tell you different, lift that pedal (YES! IT'S GREAT) but be
ready, 'cause that pretty behind of your beloved car will move out! Once it
does (and you bet it does - fast) steer and stump that pedal back down
again (kick her ass baby). She'll love you for it and come right back where
you want it. Powerslide it all the way, very NIIIIIIICE!

Ok now for a more rational explanation, in case of understeer (which means
you're taking that corner too fast) the car will slide to the outside of
the corner (not where you wanted to go). By lifting you'll create oversteer
(the exact opposite, turning the car further to the inside of the corner,
where you intended to go). Ofcourse you'll have to correct this too again
(unless you want to exit the corner backwards) which is done by increasing
the throttle. If you do it nice and smooth, you'll get the most beautiful
powerslides ever possible and a BIG grin on your face that'll last at least
a day.
As far as I know this is the only way to keep it on the road if you went in
too fast (please correct me if I'm wrong - I'm no drivers ed instructor,
just someone overenthousiastic who learned from his mistakes the hardway -
not with my 911 thank you very much).
Have fun, but be VERY carefull!

Hmmmm… this might work. But let me tell you, don't do it unpracticed (just
try to brake with your left/clutch foot on a straight road and make sure
there's nobody near your rear end and wear your seatbelts… you'll see what
I mean. Have fun!).
