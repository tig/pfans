Hello everyone and specifically Brian Buxton, whom I notice also owns a '79
930!

A little history:
I have just purchased a 1979 930 (previously owned a 1982 928S, 1985/2
944, 1986 944, 1985 928S and a 1980 911SC).  Everything on the car was
stock and it was driven very little (38,832 miles to be exact) so I
couldn't say no to the purchase.  There were a couple of dings and chips in
the paint and a
couple of surface rust spots where rock chips took off the paint and
exposed the metal underneath.  Due to the age of the paint, I am having a
body shop take the car down to the metal and reprimer and paint it the
original color (dark blue slate) and replace all of the outer seals.  I'm
adding new H-4 lights and lowering the car.  Since the car was sitting for
long periods of time, I am having my mechanic replace all the engine
gaskets and seals as well as updating the chain tensioners, tuning it up,
doing leakdowns, and valve adjustments (basically a major service).  I have
added new stainless steel heat exchangers and a 4 1/3" dual outlet exhaust
system to get more horsepower and a meatier sound.  I have also upgraded
the turbo and am now probably pushing around 350+ HP from the stock 265.

My three questions:
1) My mechanic was wondering if I wanted to replace the stock air filter
system (it being so bulky and large), with, I am assuming, a K&N system of
some sort.  I have heard that doing so will increase my horsepower a bit
more (+7-10HP) and provide 37% more air for the engine.  I have also heard
that during hard and heavy rains and car washes that water can get into the
engine and cause the engine not to turn over and risk damage.  Is this true
or am I reading about something completely different?  Should I change my
air filter system?

2) What are some opinions on the Weltmeister Cambermeister strut brace?  Is
it worth it?  I will be doing some track events, as well as racing the
quarter mile (hoping to make it into the 11's), but mostly street/highway
driving.

3) Anything that I should be aware of about the 1979 930's regarding
oversteer, maintenance, peculiarities or FYI's?

Thanks and sorry for the long post, but I wanted to have done whatever
needs to be done to the car while its still at the mechanic's.

It's great to once again own another of these incredible machines!
