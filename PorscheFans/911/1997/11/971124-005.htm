I have found the Pfans list an indespensible resource for my restoration
project. Although, much time has been spent in the archives, searching for a
thread I'd remembered to have occured about the end of a certain month... A
search engine would be so useful.  I've had to keep my own database of
detailed task instructions with the date posted for those tasks that I know
will be coming soon in my project. For instance, Doug Dutton has recently
described rear targa glass installation in a multipart series (was there a
part 2?). The description was so detailed that I glazed over as I read it
but I know that when glass installation time comes I'll reread it several
times. If I did not log the info and the date, it is likely that the
usefulness of that post would be deminished. Which brings up several
questions. Should such detailed post be in replies to direct questions posed
by other members? Do members find any usefulness in posts in the blind that
gives detailed info without the prompt of a posted question? I have posted
progress reports on my project, is this type of material interesting to the
list? There are many projects ongoing amoung the list members where gumption
traps are encountered and overcome in innovative ways and that would benefit
other subsequent project navigators. Many of these nuggets are shared on the
list, but I bet many more do not get shared. As useful as this list is, it
is also entertaining, KEEP IT UP!
