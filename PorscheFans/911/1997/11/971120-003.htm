My understanding is (look out!  we all know what a good mechanic I am!)
that the guards did indeed fix 85-90% of the failures.  But that last 10%
is about a $3500 problem and $500++ seems like cheap insurance to me.  I
had mine updated even though my "guarded" tensioners were in great shape.
Makes me feel a lot better.

Incidentally, the hydraulic type aren't 100% perfect either.  When mine
were installed and I drove away, I got about 5 miles from the shop and
started hearing that dreaded death rattle.  Upon investigation, it turned
out that the oil lines hadn't been drilled out and the tensioners were
starved of oil.  Result:  failed hydraulic tensioners and do the job one
more time!  Thank God it didn't jump a couple of teeth....
