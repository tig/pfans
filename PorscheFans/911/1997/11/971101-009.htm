I didn't like the oil temp gauge in my 81 SC, so I decided to change
to the gauge with numeric temps on it. Got mine from AJ-USA for $59,
including the sender. Getting the gauge out of the dash was
simplicity itself: open the front hood, move the carpet aside, and
push the gauge out of the dash. 4 small screws hold the oil temp
portion in the larger housing. Old out, new in, change wires to new,
push housing back into the dash, done with part 1. Part 2 requires
replacing the existing temperature sender on the engine with the new
(actually it's the pre-SC sender) sender. The sender is on the right
side of the engine where the cam oil line comes out at the base of
the fan.  You'll see a yellow/black wire attached to the end of it.
Detach the wire, undo the existing sender, put the new sender in
(don't forget the washer), attach the wire, and you're done. Took
about 45 mins start to finish.
