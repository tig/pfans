Good morning all,

I finally got some guts and sold my almost new, reliable, fast and
waterproof (worth mentioning with all this rain) GTI-VR6 to satisfy the
Porsche gods. I could not resist the urge any longer. 

Now, finding a Porsche is another problem.... A friend suggested I look
into the PCA newsletter's or Panorama's ads as people advertising in
there are probably more porsche fanatics than your average joe in the
paper and more likely to have taken good care of the car. Catch 22, to
join the PCA you need a VIN, to get a VIN you  need a 911 !!!  Anyway,
even if you borrow a VIN, the whole process takes time, and I need a car
ASAP. 

I'd really appreciate your help in locating a 80/85 SC/Carrera coupe
(not targa unless it's the driest targa on the planet) with a good
engine in the SF bay area, either thru the PCA newsletter you may have
in your possession or if you just happen to know someone ! 

Any help would be very much appreciated. As for me, I am already going
thru all the sites, papers and ads like crazy, but so far, I can only
find overpriced cars...(at least compared to what Henry Watts says I
should be able to get for around $17/18K) ..

Many thanks !  

Greg. 
65 Karmann ghia cabrio...
ex-GTI soon 911 ???
