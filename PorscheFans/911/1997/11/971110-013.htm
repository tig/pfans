     Having just subscribed to the list, I thought that a problem I
experienced yesterday might be a good opportunity for me to try out the
list.

     During a climbing left hand turn on an interstate highway cloverleaf
(at 911 type speed), I noticed the smell of burning oil on a heater
exchanger followed immediately by significant quantities of white oil smoke
through the defroster ducts at the windshield base.  Upon slowing down, I
noticed that the oil pressure was normal at idle and 3000 RPM.  Oil
quantity at the gauge and dipstick was also normal.  A more sedate trip
home produced no further problems.  After elevating the rear end at home I
did not see any noticeable oil leaks.  Can any one give me some thoughts on
what to look for and where to look when I spend some time poking around a
cooler engine this evening?  I have not experienced this problem with the
73T CIS Targa I have owned since 1979.  The coupe is a new acquisition this
summer.

     The following specifics apply:

     1973 911 T, Coupe, (911 310 1028) stock MFI, 911/51 engine

     SSI Heat exchangers (Therefore there is no Aux pre heater air bleed
off the left exchanger to the inlet side of the air filter).  The residual
hole in the rear engine sheet metal has been plugged.

     Warm Oil level at idle is roughly between min and max marks

     Original oil return tubes have been replaced by collapsible tubes.

     At the time of the oil smoke, the vent selection lever on the dash was
set to the far left (floor) position.  Heater control lever between seats
was at roughly half travel.   Outside air was around 45 F.

     This was the first left hander after a series of two right handers
followed by a 1/4 mile straight without incident.


     Thanks for the help.  I look forward to being a part of the 911 list.
