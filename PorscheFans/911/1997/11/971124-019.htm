Of course you need these.  Because they look *cool* that's why.
Oh sure, if you really want those garden variety *regular* plug
wires, I'm sure they'd be fine and all.

I can't believe I have to keep telling you guys:

Every time someone attempts to introduce sanity and reason to this
equation they risk a very dangerous precedent.  If we all start just
doing what we need instead of what we want, anything could happen :)

I shudder to think of what would happen if my family and friends
found out I don't actually *need* braided plug wires or brake
lines.  Or that Nardi wheel, or those Recaro seats or... You see the
problem here?  What if my neighbors found out my car would run
just fine without that performance exhaust??   Did you think about
that?  No, of course not.  I know it's hard to believe but some
people actually question the need for sports cars, so you
can't be too careful.

And if could happen to me it could happen to you too.

So the rest of you better think long and hard next time you start
sending around questions like this.

And I don't want to have to say this again.
