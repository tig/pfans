You are certainly not alone in your perceptions and observations. We just
bought a Toyota Avalon for my wife's daily driver and the family
tripmobile. It is basically a Lexus-like Camry (or the Camry is the Poor
Man's Avalon). In any event, I doubt any car maker has the option of not
building on a lineup by offering extensions to base models. Hear that gasp?
It's the Boxster owners.

When I saw the "new" 911 I was blown away as it does appear to be an
inflated and stretched Boxster. I question whether the philosophy at
Porsche changed as I understand that they brought in japanese manufacturing
consultants to help design the Boxster assembly line and one must presume
the 911 as well. The real issue is whether or not you are a 911 classicist
or not. When the 901 was introduced, many of the 356 owners decried the
failure of Porsche to maintain the helm, so to speak. My problem with the
new 911 is not so much that it looks like a Boxster, but that it looks like
so many other cars. This could never be said of the reptilian 911 (ever
have one behind you at night?) as the new one looks like a carp (koi?). If
this move keeps Porsche healthy as a company I applaud it, nevertheless,
the end of an era is always difficult to accept.

I have to keep reminding myself that the buyers of new Porsches are far
removed from me financially. We can only hope that Porsche is accommodating
them.
