On Sun, 9 Nov 1997, Kapil Luthra spammed us with:

Great. Just when the "seats for sale" post was about to die out, this 
guy shows up. Do not be misled by the innocent nature of his post. 
I've seen this same post on at least three other auto related sites. 
HE'S the one selling the Zymol - and now we're going to have to 
endure dozens of copys of his stupid post. I don't know what the 
official policy of the list is regarding spam, but I do know that I 
would not buy Zymol from this guy if he were the last dealer on the 
planet. Just my $0.02.
