Forgive me for sticking my nose in, but I'm a little curious.  Has your
engine been "massaged" a little?  The reason I ask is that my factory-stock
79 SC will pull cleanly from idle speed (~800 rpm) in all gears.  In fact,
I rather like the rumbly sound I get while moving slowly through parking
decks -- sure makes people turn and stare!  If you floor it from that speed
it will pull easily, accelerating harder as the rpms climb.  It seems to me
that this should be typical of 911s that haven't had any modifications.
