Seem like, I was making a fool of myself by asking this question.

I thought there will be more than just GAS to the answer.

But the word "throttle" seem to me a techincal term. I just want to be sure.
Of course, as a foreigner, I prefer simple English (American English).

Next time, I will instruct my instructor to use simple English. :^)

Thank you all who reply to my question. Have a nice day.

    Clemson:

    It's the "gas pedal".

    If you don't understand something the instructor is saying, you
    should ask him for an explanation as soon as possible... Imagine
    the consequences, for example, if you didn't understand "Brake!
    Brake!"
