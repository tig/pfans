	I would have to agree with Mike.. the 996 looks like a Lexus..
actually that's a backhanded compliment to Lexus..  it doesn't even look
that good (the Lexus has a stronger overall theme). I'll admit that my
first glimpse of the car left me with a very sad feeling that I hoped would
abate with time.. it actually waxed.. Every new photo essay I'd see
manifested new things I'd wish i had not noticed. I believe my assessment
is grounded, and I'm not shooting from the hip- (I've got a degree in
Industrial Design and been working in the field for 8 years). The overall
design is merely "ok".. (ok, and Porsche should never be in the same
sentence).. some things were approached with a new insight and an
improvement was made: the way the rear quarters and the slope of the rear
window merge in a new and simple line.. some things were approached in a
cavalier manner and come off looking like afterthoughts: the mirrors with a
seemingly random color break across the bottom.

	I do understand the importance of progress. Product development and
improvement are things which I live by.. yet the 993 looks far more
cohesive and modern then the 996. the lines represent an evolution of the
design. the 996's lines look like a balloon filled with plaster and
distorted into vaguely pleasing shape and left to harden. The headlights
don't seem that bad, except for their shape which finds itself floating on
a bonnet with no points to tie it in. and why not keep a color-field as it
has been.. there are a few things which make the classic 911 lines still
classic. one is the round headlights. the 993 took the round concept and
dialed it to a new level.. the 996 dropped the ball there.. it would have
been as simple as keeping the body color behind the non-round area in the
lens... if you cover up the silver-glass color over the turn signal and try
to make the lights round, the car actually looks pretty good from 3/4
view..

	I'm okay with adding a water cooled engine.. i'm sure the
suspension is really smooth... if i wanted smooth suspension, i'd get a
minivan though... my real gripe is the interior... okay, i can deal with
the "cluster" now a cheaper single unit, (no more replacing single gauges,
or twisting the tach so it redlines @ 90 degrees) BUT THE CENTER
CONSOLE............ *HELLO*  what the hell?? i can't figure it out.. it is
the poorest piece of design work I have seen to date. I'd be pissed if i
had that in a new rental Ford Taurus.. let alone in a german car.... I hope
to god it was not some Industrial Designer my age, rendering pretty Art
Center sketches of center consoles with lots of gleamies.. the thought of
that makes me a bit mad.. had I the power,  I'd take his/her markers away
and send the designer to Mitsubishi where that type of stuff goes rewarded.
...... i'm sorry, i get emotional... it seems as now that most of the cool
things about the car are now gone.... the things that made it a legend have
all evaporated.. the quirky dash, the individual gauges, the cryptic
heating system... we didn't even get anything as a cool trade.. a dash full
of trendy oval plastic buttons....

	I must be a luddite....
