Troy,

I have the Weltmeister kit in my '80 SC.  I like it.  I wouldn't go back to
the original.  The main benefit for me is that 2nd gear no longer hits the
right front of my seat.  I won't say that I can really shift faster, but
the feel is better.

The installation is easy.  Took me about 2 hours to do the initial install.
 Then I spent the next week fine tuning the coupler adjustment that is
accessable by removing the cover on the floor in front of the rear seats. 
The adjustment is VERY sensitive.  But the shifter really needs to be
positioned properly to get the full benefit.

By the way, there was some discussion about epoxy based kits that are
cheap.  The first kit I bought was one of these & it never made it into my
car.  The Weltmeister kit is NOT this type.  It has a one-piece shift rod. 
No glue.  I have had the kit installed for over two years now and it has
seen several track days with no problems.

I have also heard only good things about the factory shift kit.  I have
never seen the kit or driven a car with it.  I'm sure it is a quality kit. 
But, the Weltmeister is a quality kit as well, in my opinion.  You cannot
tell by looking at it that anything is different.

If you get the kit and want some details on installation, let me know.  I
will be glad to help.
