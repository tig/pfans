I agree with Scott's comments...in five years, the evolving 996 will be
recognized by most as an elegant evolution of the 911 and the best Porsche
ever produced.

I remember in 1963, upon introduction at the Frankfurt Auto Show, the then
new 911 (901) was decried by some of the tonier European automobile magazines
along the lines as "...a vulgar interpretation of General Motor's new
slab-sided utilitarian compacts, the Oldsmobile F-85, Pontiac Tempest, and
Buick Skylark..." and further sniffed "...Porsche has lost the unique and
senuous flowing lines of Kommenda's original direction...".

The outcry was repeated in the introduction of the G-Body (1974) 911 with
comments suggesting an "unattractive solution" to the redesigned front and
rear end to satisfy certain country safety requirements  (but for comparison
look at the "cowcatcher" extended bumpers on Mercedes and BMW of the period).
 Again European magazines complained "...why do we need the ugly appendages
without purpose"  about the new bumpers (particularly when they did not have
the impact absorbing feature US cars did as standard equipment).

I too will admit that after 36 years of Porsche ownership I find the current
993 more attractive in what my mind has accepted as Porsche design evolution.
 However, having not seen one in the "flesh", I still find photos of the side
and front 3/4 view of the 996 modernly unique, with opportunities for future
enhancement, and very elegant...the rear end I'm not so sure of.  

My own choice to buy one of the last of the breed 1997 993's has more to do
with refinement than styling change.  Every "new" Porsche design has had
"teething" problems in early models.  Some are relatively minor and "Rube
Golberg" (no offense intended please!) initial solutions are fixed relatively
early (such as lead ballast in the bumpers) while others (like chain
tensioner design, etc) are stubbornly resisted for many years.

To it's credit (in design and manufacturing techniques), the Boxster (based
on comments from the list) seems to have far fewer "teething" problems than
early 911's, 924/944's, 928's, etc.   Perhaps the willingness to learn from
others ("Excellence is Accepted" rather than "Arrogance is Expected")
,including the Japanese, has broken the "...We Know What is best for You..."
mentality (and recognized individual genius) of the Fuhrmann era.
