RE: starter motor would seem to spin but not engage. =20

My guesses and explanation. =20

If it is spinning but not engaging then it is the solenoid or a bound up =
starter drive.

The solenoid on the side of the starter (the thing a little smaller than =
a coke can) creates and electric field (magnet) that slides the starter =
drive (hunk of metal, spring, and a small gear with about 10 teeth in =
starter) out to mate with the flywheel.  On a 356 Porsche, the =
half-inch-ish tip of this starter drive fits in a bushing that is in the =
transmission bellhousing.  I don't remember if a 911 has one or not.  My =
checklist is a follows:

The bushing could be dinged up. =20
The starter drive could be dinged up.
The starter bolts could be loose so it is not mating properly with the =
flywheel.
The starter bushings could be warn enough to cause misalignment.
The solenoid could be bad...I think?.

Chinciest solution is probably a 914 (1.4 horse starter).  911 starters =
are 1/2 horse.
A 914 starter worked great on my 90k+ mile 911 SC except the 2 coldest =
days in VA.  If you are fixing yourself and feeling cheap, compare the =
used price of a starter from somebody like PAR to a new one and decide =
what is best for you.  Somebody may sell you a solenoid...probably $50 =
new.

If the starter is spinning, it is getting juice.  I think it is =
misalignment via worn parts.

MAYBE replace starter
 NOT battery [done]
OK tighten connections [done]
PROBABLY NOT noise suppressor connection from regulator [done]
WHATEVER check draw [< 1v]
NOT voltage regulator [the French Marchant ?]
NOT alternator
NOT replace alternator and starter
NOT replace ignition switch

Fred
