Mike,  

You asked about a "COMPLETE" list of sealants, adhesives, lubricants and
other items for rebuilding a 911.  I did not respond because the list is
too broad with too many options; I can only guess that others did not
respond for the same reason.  

I fear that this list and the members are getting a bad reputation for not
responding to some inquiries.  This should not be the case as a lot of good
information about serious and specific items is usually discussed.
Recently there has been a decided lack of creativity and serious discussion
as much of the list has been taken up by generic questions like "what year
is best" or "I want to go faster".

I prefer answering specific questions (and I'm often wrong).  I usually
require that the individual has given some thought to it before I do (this
applies throughout my life).

I have often posed questions and subsequently received no replys (please
don't flame).  I assume that this means no one has any ideas, that my
question was poorly worded, or that no one want to provide input.  That is
fine.  I might even try again later in case other people are monitoring the
list.

Stepping down now, thanks.

**Now to answer your question**
Go around your 911 carefully inventorying everything that you think needs
to be done (e.g., repainting)  Think through the process and list all of
the supplies (a repair manual will help).  For the body, you will need
sanding supplies, strippers, primers, fillers, tape, trim gaskets, paint,
thinners, tack clothes, degreasers, and more.  I think that there are many
quality products available in each category each of which may have a trade
off.  Personal preference certainly is a factor in you choice.

If you can't decide on a specific product (e.g., paint manufacturer) please
pose you question to the list for comments from others.

Good luck maintaining and rebuilding you 911.
