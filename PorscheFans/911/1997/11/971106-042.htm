Actually Rob, it's about a 30 minute job, and all you need is a 27mm =
socket and a $4 Porsche part.  What you need to replace is a plastic =
collar within the bearing that the steering shaft rides on, not the =
bearing itself.  Here's an old post of mine that pretty much covers it:

I just replaced the plastic bearing collar at the top of my steering =
column with the 928 part Bruce A. recommended here and in Excellence =
(part 928.347.739.02).  It works great.
This repair looks like it's good for life.  The 928 part is metal, not =
plastic like my original broken part.  It's about an inch long bushing, =
the top edge of which is flanged to hold it against the bearing and keep =
it from falling down the column.  The part is slightly oversize, but it =
has a narrow slot cut down it's length so when you install it, it =
compresses slightly so it stays in place.
I put some wheel bearing grease on it, and then easily pushed it into =
place using just finger pressure.
The part only cost me $4.86 at the local dealer.
Thanks Bruce!
You can do the repair  in about 30 minutes.  All you need is a =
screwdriver and a 27mm socket (available at Sears).

First just pull your horn pad straight off the wheel.  Disconnect the =
horn wire.  If you ground it, the horn will go off.  This exposes the =
27mm nut.

It's on pretty tight.  Make sure you or someone holds the wheel for you =
as you remove it.  I think there is a good chance of damaging the =
steering wheel lock if you rely on it to keep the wheel from turning.  =
Now mark the position of the wheel on the steering shaft so you can be =
sure to put the wheel back on the exact same splines.  The wheel should =
pull right off.

You now can see the remains of the green plastic bushing, unless yours =
has completely disintegrated already.  Use the screwdriver to push any =
remaining bits down the shaft.  Now just grease the new part lightly =
(probably not really necessary) and push it into place with your =
fingers.  Put everything back together and you're done.

Good luck!
