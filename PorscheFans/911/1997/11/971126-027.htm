I want to second the kudos for the Monty muffler. I am very happy with both
the sound and the quality of construction of my Monty. I can't comment on
any horsepower gains because I also installed SSI headers and I can't say
what percentage of the gain was contributed by the muffler. The model I
purchased was the M-22 for the '74 style headers with twin 75mm outlets. It
is kind of loud, but now I can hear the sound of the exhaust over the other
engine noises and I love it.

BTW, my car is still for sale (minus the headers and muffler):
'86 911 Coupe, triple black, 52K miles, immaculate condition,
rare factory options: limited slip and sports seats,
plus other options, accessories, and extensive suspension modifications.
