     Dear 914 GT Replica Owners, 911RS owners and "paint/body-guys",
     
     
        One argument against the inexpensive fiberglass 914-GT flares has 
     always been that the paint will eventually crack where they interface 
     with the steel. With the traditional paint used on these cars, I 
     absolutely believe that this will happen since the paint is fairly
     dense and brittle (takes a lovely polish because of these attributes).
     
     With modern paint compounds commonly used in automotive production 
     today (and all the cars using large flexible bumper covers over steel
     bodies), hasn't that "paint-cracking" issue been licked?  If this is 
     the case, what paint should I specify to cover my 'glass GT flares for
     a lasting paint job?  Has anyone seen success in overcoming this 
     problem?  Any special "tricks" in adhering/riveting the flares to the 
     steel fenders?   I understand steel flares are available, but I'd 
     rather put that $1200-1500 toward paint and other bodywork.
     
     
     
     Once again I go to the well for enlightenment, thanks Porschefans 
     List.
