It makes sense that like springs Torsion bars wear out but that doesn't mean you need to replace them.  Seems to me it the car doesn't sag (the bars properly adjusted carry the weight of the car) and the car isn't bottoming out over bumps with 2 or less people in it, the the bars are doing their job.  If you are worried about sudden failure as in breaking that is another story.  I have herd of this only once, after someone hit a big pot hole and I don't know if the bar broke or twisted free at the end but he could drive home on it. So in my opinon I wouldn't replace them just because they are old.
