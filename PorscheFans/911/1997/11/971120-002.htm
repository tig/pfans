>In case you didn't know this, Howard Stern's interviews with the babes and
his little quiz reveals some basic underwriting factors that the insurance
industry has been using in their rating of premiums for Porsche 911 cars in
recent years.

It is what is known as the BBBB factor, and results in insurance premiums
for Porsches being 155.5557% higher than the true actuarial rating of the
vehicles premiums.  The BBBB factor adds a dollar value equal to $100.5557%
of the statistical premium for collision and liability insurance for
Porsches, but a reduction in loss of use and comprehensive fire and theft
values.

While a closely kept secret by the insurance industry for several years,
because of Howard Stern's interview, the definition of the BBBB factor can
now be revealed.  BBBB stands for BigBoobedBlondeBimbo, and this office has
just received information that DOT is considering requiring that Porsche
place a BBBB warning placard next to the MSRP sticker on the windows of all
new 911s.
