Dear Mr. Schepps: 
Thanks so very much for your very kind reply. Yes, of course, I realized that 
Bill's repeat posting was likely a server screwup the millisecond after I 
pushed the "send " button on my Email program. Unfortunately, one can 
reconsider sending an ill conceived letter on the way to the post office, but 
this is not an option for Email. I hope that you had some feelings of regret 
after sending this lovely little piece, but I somehow doubt it. I have so far 
received about ten messages explaining the server problem, and yours is by far 
the least gentlemanly one of the bunch. Congratulations.

Are you really that dim as to believe Bill is posting that message over and
over again to the General, Racing, and 944 lists?
Don't you think its possible that the list server may be screwed up.  It
happens once in a while.
Why don't you complain to the people who volunteer their time and resources to
making this list possible?  Or maybe just get off of it.
