Folks,

Tony,
 Mine ('86w/915) doesn't behave like your's but the
clutches of two friends of mine did. Their clutch
pedals could be pulled back another 1" with finger 
pressure. Adjusting the cable "fixed" it and still left
the required 1mm gap at the lever. 
 I've adjusted my cable (at least) the last 6 times myself 
but since my friends' cars (with floppy clutch pedals) are mostly 
professionally maintained it makes me wonder if I've been 
doing something wrong all this time. Comments welcome.
