Supercharging thread .....
Question:
Does anyone have any experience (good or bad) with the paxton or whipple
supercharger kit for the
Porsche 3.0 liter motor. Im thinking about adding the whiple kit to a 1979
911SC stock 3.0 liter motor.
Supercharging of Knoxville, (423) 842-9556 TN claims about 300+ out of a
stock 3.0 liter engine.
Can this be true? I do realize that it must put some additional strain on
the stock crankshaft and there may have to be adjustment to ignition/timing.
They claim that the torque is increased along a smoother powerband, without
the turbo lag associated with turbo charged engines.
Any feed back would be greatly appreciated.

Answer:
Hi John,
I have experience with both units. The Whipple is excellent! I use it on a
Carrera 4 as a daily driver and track driving. I plan to do Car & Drivers
One Lap of America with this car in 1998. Fairly pricy installation for the
3.6 engine but a bolt-on system for the 3.0 and 3.2 engine due to starting
with a lower compression ratio. My wife had a Mercedes 300E with a Paxton
system from Mosselman. It made 330 hp the engine and was fine but the
supercharger itself was not reliable. I've heard that Paxton has improved on
the design. Also a friend of mine had a 944 with the Paxton system from SoK,
it ran great as well. No probs with supercharger but he was a little too
free with adjusting the timing advance and burnt a piston. So, these systems
can be very reliable but must be respected.
I had a 1979 911SC for several years. One thing I've found in all the
Porsche techie info is the 3 liter engines have the strongest crank of any
model. The pistons are excellent but very close tolerance. Most owners
won't pay the extra to lower the compression so the boost level must be kept
low at 5 - 7 psi. This is plenty and yes you can get 300 hp safely from the
911SC engine.
In talking to Mike Parker at SoK they have tested the Whipple on the 3 liter
for quite a long time to be sure of the quality and reliability. This would
be my choice. Low boost but plent of torque!! The Paxton would require a
Turbo tail and the Whipple should not.
Any more questions please let me know or if your serious call Mike at
Supercharging of Knoxville.

Zane Dobson

Question:
Zane,
I have a few questions:
You say the Whipple system is more reliable and why. Which produces more hp?
Paxton or Whipple.
Do either units require an intercooler for the 911?
You said that the psi can be adjusted, is this easy to do yourself?
What about installation of these kits for a 3.0 liter motor. How involved is
the installation of these kits for 3.0 liter engine, does it require special
tools, does it require engine removal?
What does the kit include, does the whipple kit come with anything else such
as a new performance ignition system or other parts?
Also, is there any wheel dyno / (printed) documentation on final
performance for a Paxton or Whipple supercharged 911
Thanks John
