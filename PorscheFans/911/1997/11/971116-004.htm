Few on the list may be interested in installing factory rear swaybars on a
'69 911T Targa but I thought I'd archive how I did it. The car did not have
any attachments for fitting the swaybar to the chassis or the rear
suspension arms. So I purchased chassis consoles and ball pins  from
Stoddards. The chassis consoles are better know as the swaybar mounts and
the ball pins insert into the rear suspension banana arms and attach to the
swaybar uplinks. Next I posted to the Pfans list to get help on installation
from someone more knowledgeable. Walter Fricke answered with some very
critical dimensions and helpful general suggestions. The process of
installation was made easier because the chassis was rotated onto its side
(its being restored) and the rear suspension was removed. The banana arms
and spring plates were reinstalled and the chassis consoles were clamped in
place with 4 inch "C" clamps. The chassis has a circular stamping at the
location of where the consoles are placed that matches with a circular
stamping in the console, such that the console nests into the chassis. The
swaybar, complete with attached uplinks, was then bolted to the consoles.
Measurements were taken to confirm dimensions, and measurements were
repeated for accuracy. The banana arms were removed and mounted on an
indexing vice on a lathe. The vice was turned 35 degrees in the horizontal
plane and 10 degrees in the vertical plane which aligns the drilling axis
with the normal axis of the swaybar uplink. The shoulder of the gusset on
the banana arm where the ball pin inserts had a dimple already to mark the
drilling center. The pin part of the ball pin is tapered. I measured the
diameter of the taper on the ball pin at 43 mm from the top of the ball. By
drilling and reaming the gusset to this diameter, the ball would protrude 43
mm from the gusset. Lacking a secondary gusset that is present in other cars
with factory installed bars, I drilled into the tube of the banana arm.
Again, I took the hole size from the diameter of the tapered pin. The ball
pins were inserted and welded. The banana arms were reinstalled into the
chassis and the swaybar uplinks where popped onto the ballpins. The chassis
consoles were adjusted to allow the banana arms ample travel without binding
the bar. Also several reference points were used to ensure that equal
distances where maintained on each side for symmetry. The consoles were
double checked for visual alignment. After removing the swaybar, the clamped
consoles where welded. The swaybars were reinstalled and everything worked
well. The proof of the pudding will come when the car is road tested.
