Does anyone have information on installing a rear swaybar in an early =
911 (69T) that does not initially have one? I have the bar consoles and =
the ball pins. The placement and welding of the bar consoles seem to be =
straight forwardly self evident. However, the insertion of the ball pins =
into the rear 'banana' arm has me puzzled. The ball pin has a taper, so =
I am unclear as to the size of the hole to be drilled into the arm. =
Also, the pin is quite heavy (thick) in comparision to the brace in the =
arm into which it inserts, so how is it fastened? Is it welded? TIA
