	The Niagara Region, PCA will host the 1998 Zone 1 Concours. Zone 1 roughly
covers the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada.  In addition to the
Concours, we have scheduled a swapmeet and several other events.  The
events are scheduled for May 15 - 17 at the Grand Island Holiday Inn and
Conference Center.  The site is located roughly 5 miles south of Niagara
Falls.  We anticipate over one hundred entrants and several hundred
participants over the weekend.

	The Niagara Region is also opening the event to vendors that are
interested presenting product tech highlights in a conference setting. We
are looking for sponsors for concours awards and exhibitors / vendors for
the swapmeet.  We intend to distribute "goodie bags" at registration, and
welcome donations including catalogs and items with logos.
