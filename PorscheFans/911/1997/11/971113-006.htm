Hi Warren:

I've suffered starter problems in two of my 3 P'cars so let me share my
collective wisdom with you... (of course, for what its worth :-)

First, the starter has a solenoid that contains both a plunger and spring.
When activated, through the ignition switch, it pushes the pinion gear out
to engage the flywheel.

Now here is where I don't understand your problem. You say:
>starter motor would seem to spin but not engage.

Did you just get a whining noise, or was the noise similar to how a starter
"shrieks" when it's used on an engine that's already running?

The two noises are very different indicating two different problems:
1:  If its only a whine, then either the solenoid is intermittently sticking
(remove & clean - easy) or the pinion gear isn't being thrust out to engage
the flywheel or is damaged (probably will require a new starter :-(

2: If the engine shrieks (like using the starter when the engine is already
running..) then you have another (read more $$) problem.  typically, the
flywheel has a couple of teeth that are mashed and the starter won't fully
engage. Porsche had a problem on '87 911's flywheel offset/starter combo -
but it was not for your year ('77).

To check the condition of the flywheel, there is an inspection hole at the
base of the bellhousing.  Use a flashlight and have a partner rotate the
engine from the crank pulley.  None of the teeth should be broken (yes they
do wear, but it should not be overly apparent with only 25K miles on the
engine..). If there are a couple of teeth broken off/damaged in a row (2-4
teeth), you've probably found another potential source of the problem - when
the engine shuts off - if these broken teeth are lined up to the pinion
gear - the starter will whine and not engage.  Don't ask how I know this....

Anyway, here is my opinion on what you've been told about the potential
fixes:
>replace starter - possible
>replace battery [done] - has nothing to do with your problem - would either
be a slow crank or no crank (not a whine)
>tighten connections [done] - not the problem - the starter wouldn't
engage/whine at all, or it would be fine
>remove noise suppressor connection from regulator [done] - not the problem
>check draw [< 1v] - not the problem
>replace voltage regulator [the French Marchant ?] - not the problem
>replace and/or update alternator - not the problem
>replace alternator and starter - the alternator is not the problem
>replace ignition switch - very, very doubtful

Anyway, drop me a note back if you have more info about the problem or have
questions.... Hope this helps you out...

Good luck,
