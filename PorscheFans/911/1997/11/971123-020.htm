Subject: Re: B&B Exhaust and Hot Bumper

I too had the bubble problem. After putting together my restoration project
911 ('69) I noticed the new paint on the rear license panel was bubbling. I
don't remember this happening when the car was running before (although
admittedly it's been years since this thing was running). However, since then
I did have the muffler power coated flat black and this probably contributed
to the increase heat radiation. I installed a heat dam between the muffler
and the license plate panel using some galvanized hardware store sheet metal.
I roll formed it around some old PVC piping to approximate the radius of the
muffler, then mounted it with sheet metal screws on a 20" bracket I
fabricated out of 1" x .125" aluminum flat stock. The stock muffler bands
hold this bracket in place. So far, the panel still gets very warm but not so
hot as to bubble the paint.

BTW, have you noticed how close the heat exchangers are to your shocks? Have
you noticed how hot the heat exchangers are? Touch them.. Go ahead. Feeling
lucky today punk? Opps... sorry, I got carried away with my Clint Eastwood
shtick.

To prevent the shock seals/fluid from getting fried, I wrapped them with some
aluminized bubble wrap (the hardware store sells it as attic insulation) and
held them on with a couple of large hose clamps. Now the heat exchangers can
get as toasty as they want without overheating the fluid in my shocks. BTW,
have you noticed how close the tires are to the heat exchangers? I'd better
go. It's getting late and it's only 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
