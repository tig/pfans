Coleman,

I have some data to add from my experiences.  I bought a Carrera 4S in June
with 18" P-Zero's.  After about a dozen autoX's, one track event and 7700 
total miles, they were well done.  Both rears were corded, possibly by a spin 
at Thunder Hill or several autoX spins.  The left front was pretty close to
gone too, only the right front had any tread life left.  So I upgraded all
to Bridgestone S-02's.  The tirerack charged me $1320 delivered for the set.
I think that we are going to have to get use to this.  Ouch!  A local tire
shop (Discount Tires, yeah right) quoted me $2200 (b4 tax) installed.

The Bridgestone is a nicer tire.  I have decided to retire these for street
use only and have moved onto Hoosiers for autoX and track.  If you drive
your Porsche like it should be driven, don't expect miles from your tires.
