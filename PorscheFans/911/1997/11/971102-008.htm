I have the following problem with my 85 Carrera. During the year that I
have the car in my posession now, it starts to smoke more often during
the start of the engine. Sometimes this happens twice a week (I use the
car daily), sometimes it doesn't smoke for months. During normal use it
does not smoke at all even at high RPM. Does anyone have any ideas what
could be the cause of this ?. (the actual smoke smells more like fuel
than it does like oil by the way)

The car is imported in the Netherlands from Sweden. Some stuff is
different on the car because of its origin (fog lights for instance). I
was wondering if the engine also has modifications ?

If anyone can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.


Kin regards,

Marc van Vossen
