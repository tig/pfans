My understanding is that it has an inertial sensor to measure
acceleration. Aside from 12 volts DC(?), the unit has no external
connections. All of the unit's computations are done entirely using
acceleration and time. For example, it computes velocity using the
relationship: accleration = dv/dt. You manually input the mass and
it estimates HP. The HP reading is not terribly accurate as it can't
account for Cd, ambient conditions, rolling resistance, etc., but is
probably more reliable than just the seat of the pants :-).

Its biggest problem is that any inclination (either from not mounting 
perfectly level or from inclined roads) will throw off the readings. 
At around $150, it's not a bad toy but it will not give you the kind 
of info you'll get from a dyno's torque & HP vs. RPM graphs. If you 
are serious about performance tuning, spending the $150 on three or 
four dyno runs is a much better investment.
