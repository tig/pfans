I'm running into a problem during the restoration of my 1969 911T:

The engine fuse box contains two fuses.  The innnermost fuse is =
connected to
the coil and to the fuel pump.  When the ingition is turned to the on =
position, this
fuse is not energized.  There is a blue lead with a yellow tracer that =
heads back
to the front of the car.

If I temporarily apply power (via a jumper lead), the fuel pump starts =
running and
the coil is energized.  I can also start the car and get it running. =20

What I'm looking for is someone who is experienced in this area and may =
have
a few suggestions as to where to check.  Also, if you have any =
information on
where this lead crosses the front fuse box it may help.  The dashboard =
does light
when I turn the ignition to on and the starter moter cranks when the key =
is turned,
but for some reason, power is not getting to the lead in question.

Thanks,

Michael
