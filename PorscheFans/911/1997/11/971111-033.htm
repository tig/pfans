Sorry about the 'trick' question.

The Deutsches Museum in Munich gives credit for the 'peoples car' concept and
the original design for it to Bela Barenyi. The story is that he was trying to
get a job with Porsche in 1932 and left drawing for a 'Volkswagen'. Barenyi
took his case to court in 1952 and was awarded the patent based on a 1926
design for a rear-mounted flat engine with a body that is rather like the
original VW. He even had a preliminary design for a flat-6.

Barenyi went to work for Daimler-Benz and was responsible for several major
patents including the idea of the safety cell with crush zones,
side impact protection, safety steering wheel, and roll-over protection. He
also designed the 230/250/280SL.
