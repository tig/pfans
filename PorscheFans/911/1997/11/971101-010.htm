We're trying to troubleshoot an erratic '90 C4 speedo; tried a speedo
swap
with no help and can't find the sending unit.  There is just a plug on
the C4
where the sender can be found on a C2--Anyone know where the C4 sender
can be
found?

According to the shop manual, the pulse sensor for 90 C4 is on the left
side of the car on the gearbox.  Looking from the side of the car it
should located at the front half of the rear wheel well drivers side
(LHD).  Should have two wires attached blue and brown.  Brown is ground
and the blue becomes green at the speedo.  Hope this helps.

BTW this is different from the 91 and later models that seem to use the
ABS sensors.  If this sender doesn't exist on the gearbox you have a)
the newer system or b) onboard computer option.   Both of these look
significantly more complex to troubleshoot.  (I'm not a certified
Porsche technician) :-)
