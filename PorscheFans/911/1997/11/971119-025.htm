I think I've seen part of this video.  At the end of a video Automotion sells,
there isa RUF-CTR yellow Porsche on a track with a lot of incar and some out
of car shots.  The driver looks like he is intentionally sliding the rear end
out and smoking the tires every chance he gets.

I will look around and see if I can find it cheaper than $59.  Thanks for the
reply.
