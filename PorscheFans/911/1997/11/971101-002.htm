Just to re-visit this one more time, I think the answer to this
question is that one ultimately needs to learn how *not* to let
the car get into this situation in the first place.  IMHO, the battle
to "catch" the rear end of a 911 coming around is won in the first
couple of micro-seconds.  Once it passes a certain point, you're
merely along for the ride.

As Larry mentioned, the place to do this is on the track.  Learn
to "sense" what the rear is doing so that you can take corrective
action early.  I've usually found that when the rear-end comes
out, slight opposite lock is all that is required to control it (while
maintaining a steady throttle - doing anything drastic with the
throttle won't help...).  Do this exercise enough times on the track
and it will become second nature.  In fact, do a driver's ed in the
rain - that has to be the ultimate test of smoothness and 911
rear-end antics.... :>))
