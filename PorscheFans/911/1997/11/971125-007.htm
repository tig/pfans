I am not sure about the whole of europe but certainly here in the UK 
911's  were not suitable to run on unleaded fuel until the 1984 
DME Carrera model.  This is due to the hardness (or lack of it) of 
the exhaust valve seats which need periodic lubrication by lead from 
the fuel.

Shell say that you can run unleaded in a pre 1984 911 if you run a 
tank of leaded every 4 tanks of unleaded. Alternatively you can get 
new cylinder heads fitted (i'm sure thats cheap!).

Hope this is some help

Unleaded fuel is really no problem at all - lead was the work of the Devil.
Lead did do a few things for us, but it may have actually done more harm than
good. Lead in gasoline contaminated our oil, it fouled our plugs and it
loaded up our oil control rings. Modern cars that run on unleaded fuels last
longer, run better, and go further between services. We often see the modern
Porsches of the unleaded era run for well over two hundred thousand miles
without requiring major mechanical work. 

However, besides acting as an octane booster tetraethyl lead acts as a shock
absorber between the exhaust valves and valve seats. The concern we
enthusiasts have is for the potential of excessive valve seat recession or
pound-in because of being run without leaded fuels. The reason that lead is
so important to these older cars with "soft" seats is that the lead acts as a
lubricant between the valves and the valve seats, cushioning the valve each
time it seats to prevent exhaust valves and/or seats from recessing or
pounding-in. In older Porsches, with their softer seats and valves there is
some cause for concern. The newer cars, from 1977/78 on were designed so they
could run on unleaded gasoline. In 1978, when Porsche started to use
catalytic converters to meet the emissions standards requiring the use of
unleaded gasoline, they changed the valve seat material to an sintered iron
material that they call Pluko. Just how hard are "soft" seats and how hard do
they have to be to prevent recession or pound-in. Really soft seats are cast
iron seats with a hardness of from Rockwell 12 to 25. Seats with a Rockwell
hardness of 45 to 50 are probably hard enough in most cases to provide for
satisfactory protection. 

I have hardness tested the exhaust seats used in a number of our different
Porsche cylinder heads. I checked the following heads with the following
results:

	1) 1966 911 head RA 65
	2) 1969 911 head RA 54
	3) 1976 911 head RA 64
	4) 1.8 914 head RA 59
	5) 1.7 914 head RA 44
	6) 1962 356 head RA 64
	7) 356C/912 head RA 58

None of these seats can be considered "soft" seats and as such they should
not cause any problems with unleaded gasolines. Additionally all of the
Porsche engines built since 1964 have some form of valve rotators. Their
favorite is to use the ATE style keepers which do not hold the valve tightly,
so that the valve is free to rotate. This has served them well and only the
924 engines had  a separate valve rotator. So we should be able to use
unleaded gasoline without any additional changes. However, the best way to
keep track of what is happening until we are sure, will be with more frequent
checks of the valve clearances. Obviously, if the valve clearance changes
over a short period of time, some changes will have to be made to the exhaust
valves and/or seats.

It is also interesting to note that when lead was introduced to gasoline in
1923 there was very similar concern about the effect on the engine's valves
and valve seats because of the addition of lead to gasoline as there is today
with the removal of lead from the gasoline. At the time the engine designers
felt that the lead caused a serious service problem with the spark plugs and
exhaust valve damage caused by the corrosive effect of lead oxide. The
designers forged ahead and used lead as an additive because of leads
superiority over all other antiknock additives of that era. With higher
octane gasoline the engine designers could use higher compression ratios to
achieve major gains in both power and fuel economy. During this period of
automotive history the designs and materials used in high-compression engines
made tremendous improvements over a very short period of time. These included
special alloy exhaust valves, and seats and sodium cooled valves all to
combat valve and valve seat erosion, caused not by the removal of lead, but
the addition of lead to the gasoline. With the introduction of lead to
gasoline the octane number was increased from about 50 to todays 90+ for high
octane unleaded gasolines making possible a boost in compression ratios from
4 to 1 up to the 9+ to 1 used by all of our modern Porsche engines. Because
of advanced catalytic cracking methods and other octane boosting additives
the gasoline companies find it easier to make high octane unleaded gasolines
today than they did sixty years ago so the removal of lead from our gasoline
hasn't caused much problems. 

Engines that are run on unleaded gasoline burn cleaner and will run much
longer between tune-ups than cars that are run on leaded gasolines. All
modern normally aspirated Porsches (4, 6 and 8 cylinders) have a recommended
service interval of 15,000 miles including the oil change intervals and the
turbocharged cars have a recommended oil change interval of 7,500 miles.
Bosch has 30,000 and 50,000 mile spark plugs and the unleaded fuels are
largely responsible for these extended service intervals. It also looks like
engines that have been run on unleaded fuels will last longer than those run
on leaded fuels, it is not uncommon for 911 SC engines to run for 175,000 to
200,000 miles without requiring any major maintenance. 

Another concern for the enthusiasts should be the use of alcohols as a
gasoline octane booster or Gasohol itself. A number of auto manufactures
recommend that you do not use Gasohol, and Porsche says that if you have any
running problems, fuel economy, stalling or problems with vapor lock or hot
star problems you should switch back to a gasoline which does not use alcohol
as an additive. 

Gasoline, alcohol and water have no desire to be together. Water and gasoline
will not mix and stay mixed. If moisture gets into a fuel tank contaminating
gasoline, the moisture will eventually end up in the bottom of the tank. On
the other hand, if a gasoline with alcohol or Gasohol is used the alcohol
will hold some of the water, loosen up dirt, scale, rust, etc. and carry this
debris to the injectors or carburetors causing contamination of the fuel
induction system. If you have enough moisture in the tank you can get a
condition called phase separation where the alcohol combines with the water
in the tank and settles to the bottom of the tank. This phase separation can
cause the engine to run very poorly if a large dose of this water and alcohol
mixture is ingested by the injection system or carburetor.

Alcohols increase vapor pressure and increase the probability of fuels
boiling or vapor lock. The vapor lock depends on ambient temperatures, engine
temperatures and the temperature of the fuel. When  vapor lock occurs it can
be impossible to start the car until the temperature goes down and the fuel
vaporizes less readily. Fuel pumps, fuel injection systems and carburetors
are designed to handle fuel in the liquid phase not a vapor phase, and
therefore the problem. Carbureted engines seem to have more problems with
this high RVP problem than the more modern injected cars do so this is
probably even  more a problem for the older Porsches than it is for more
modern fuel injected cars. 

The major oil companies in the states west of the Rockies do not use alcohols
as an octane booster. Some of the independents use it extensively. In the San
Francisco Area, Beacon gasoline usually contains ethanol. They have started
just recently posting it on the pumps. In the Midwest there is lots of
Gasohol. Some Gasohols contain ethanol, some contain methanol, and others
contain mixtures. Ten percent is the maximum that is permitted by law.
Ethanol is less corrosive than methanol, but methanol is cheaper and contains
more energy.

We had originally thought that the oil companies using alcohol would be
required by state law to post that fact on their pumps. But, only about 45
states require posting. The others don't care if it is posted or not although
some oil companies are posting in some of the states where it is not
required. Oil companies using alcohol vary from area to area. It is most
common in the Midwest and frequently found along the east coast from New
Jersey to Georgia. You should try to avoid use of any fuels that are blends
of gasoline and alcohol if at all possible, and that is also true of any
additives that include alcohol as a major ingredient. 

Because of the problems caused by mixing alcohol with gasoline there are now
companies producing additives to protect cars from the use fuels with alcohol
in them. If you live in a state that uses alcohol in the gasoline you should
look into one of these additives, "Alcohol Protector" by Gold Eagle Co. 4400
So. Kildare, Chicago, IL 60632. Fuels containing alcohol have the ability to
absorb moisture from the air. Once the alcohol absorbs water to its maximum,
about 1%, a phenomenon known as phase separation can occur. The risk is that
the water and alcohol mixture can get trapped in some fuel injection systems
and cause corrosion or gum things up. 

Here in the US the gasoline companies have started to use MTBE instead of
alcohol in gasoline. The reason that the gasoline companies are blending
Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) is to help control exhaust emissions from
vehicles during the winter months when air is more dense and it takes cars
longer to reach their operating temperatures. The use of oxygenated gasolines
help to improve air quality by reducing carbon monoxide (CO) emissions which
has been a serious problem in the winter. I am told that this formulation is
required in Colorado, Arizona and some parts of Nevada from November through
March. In some metropolitan areas such as Los Angles and New York these
reformulated gasolines are also used all year around to help reduce carbon
monoxide emissions.

MTBE was originally used as a high octane blending component. As such, it was
mostly used in blends of unleaded premium gasolines to raise the fuels
octane. MTBE is just one of many oxygenates used in formulating gasoline. For
the past decade or so the gasoline companies have been using alcohols as
oxygenates to boost the octane in gasolines as the use of lead was reduced.
MTBE acts more like hydrocarbon gasoline blending stock than any of the
alcohols and is very soluble in gasoline. Also, unlike alcohol, It will not
separate from gasoline when water gets into the gasoline,. As far as
oxygenates go, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether is probably the best one to add to
gasoline and is becoming more common all the time even though it is is more
expensive because it works well. 

Alcohols produce about half of the energy that gasoline does so when you run
an engine on alcohol you use about twice as much fuel to get the the required
energy. The reason that an engine burning MTBE gets about 3% worse fuel
economy is that like the alcohols it has less energy. The end result is that
you have the same energy you just have to burn more fuel to get it. But be
thankful that we are not yet required to burn 100% alcohol because you would
have to burn almost twice as much to get the same energy as you are presently
getting with your MTBE blended gasolines. A 944 would have to have a forty
gallon fuel tank to maintain the same cruising range that it has now on
gasoline. 

Because these oxygenated fuels produce less energy there can be some problem
with using them in older cars because they will have the effect of leaning
out the mixture. This lean mixture could cause poor running and detonation
and if adjustments are not made to richen the mixture it could also lead to
damaged pistons, valves, or cylinder heads. Modern cars with oxygen sensors
and closed loop control systems will not have any problems because they will
adjust the mixture to maintain a very low level of oxygen in the exhaust. The
older cars can be adjusted or rejetted to run a little on the rich side to
improve driveability and eliminate any of these long term problem. 

We need to be much more concerned about the use of alcohols in gasolines for
any purpose whether as a water dispersant, as a gasoline octane booster or as
Gasohol itself. A number of auto manufactures recommend that you do not use
Gasohol, and Porsche has said that if you have any running problems, fuel
economy, stalling or problems with vapor lock or hot star problems you should
switch back to a gasoline which does not use alcohol as an additive. 

Gasoline, alcohol and water have no like being together. Water and gasoline
will not mix and stay mixed. If moisture gets into a fuel tank contaminating
gasoline, the moisture will eventually end up in the bottom of the tank. On
the other hand, if a gasoline with alcohol or a Gasohol is used the alcohol
will hold some of the water, loosen up dirt, scale, rust, etc. and carry this
debris to the injectors or carburetors causing contamination of the fuel
induction system. If you have enough moisture in the tank you can get a
condition called phase separation where the alcohol combines with the water
in the tank and settles to the bottom of the tank. This phase separation can
cause the engine to run very poorly if a large dose of this water and alcohol
mixture is ingested by the injection system or carburetor. 

The united states uses a different method of rating octane that is used in
Europe which causes some confusion. We use the average method which is the
RON + MON divided by two and is referred to as the CLC method (US Cost of
Living Council) or AKI (antiknock index). The older Porsche manuals for cars
like your 1969 911S would have referred only to the RON method of rating
fuels. The owners manuals since 1977 have referred to it as CLC and in the
late 80's as both CLC and AKI. 

Regular fuels in Europe have octane ratings ranging from 91 to 98 RON
(Research Octane Number) which corresponds to 87 to 93 CLC (average method).
As an example the 1977 911S/Turbo Carrera owners manual says that the 911S
engine requires 91 RON octane or 87 CLC octane so that they can quite readily
run on unleaded regular. The same manual says that the Turbo Carrera for
racing or sustained high speed driving requires 96 RON octane or 92 CLC
octane. 

The testing method that the RON is averaged with to derive our CLC numbers is
the Motor Octane (MON) which is a much more severe testing method. The motor
method tests the engine at a higher speed than the research method. Both of
these tests relate the knocking characteristics of gasoline against standards
to establish the octane numbers. RON is considered a better test of
anti-knock characteristics for engines operating at full throttle at low
engine speeds. The MON test is considered to be a better indicator of
anti-knock characteristics at full throttle high engine speed, and part
throttle low and high engine speeds. The CLC method attempts to create a more
meaningful rating by averaging the two. The CLC octane rating will usually be
four to five points lower than the RON rating.
