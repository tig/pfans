I've received a lot of advice from shops and dealers, all suggesting
relatively big $$ solutions, and none have given me confidence that they will
solve the problem.

I recently purchased a 77 911s with 25k miles in Seattle and drove it back to
New Hampshire, great trip with only the one problem.  Periodicaly, the
starter motor would seem to spin but not engage.  It bore no relationship to
hot/cold, accessories on/off, etc. etc.
Once push started, no problem.

Battery was new but not original size [70 series?], since replaced with huge
original size
Stereo was stolen and replaced by competent dealer
Alternator [not updated] was replaced when engine was overhauled/updated not
due to problems other than mechanic thought the windings looked "crispy"
Alternator puts out @13-13.5v and 40 amp. at @2500rpm but only @11.5-12 at
idle with accessories on.
Get power to starter motor via ignition switch etc.
Starter operates fine when it works, no grinding to flywheel etc.
New battery seems to hold charge fairly well and car seems more likely to
start with full battery 

Solutions I've been offered along the way include:
replace starter
replace battery [done]
tighten connections [done]
remove noise suppressor connection from regulator [done]
check draw [< 1v]
replace voltage regulator [the French Marchant ?]
replace and/or update alternator
replace alternator and starter
replace ignition switch

Any solutions which come with an explanation would be sincerely appreciated,
I don't mind spending the $$$ but want to feel confident those $$$ will solve
the problem.

Thanks
