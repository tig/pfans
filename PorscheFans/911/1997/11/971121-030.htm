Maxie Hoffman was a former motorcycle driver, from an Austrian family,
friend of the Porsche family and of Anton Piech, brother-in-law of
F.Porsche; he opened in 1947 an exotic car showroom in Park Avenue in
Manhattan, devoted to european cars, in particular Mercedes Benz and
Porsche. He realized that the American market was ready for top-end sports
car and obtained from Mercedes Benz a road version of the 300SL, winner at
Le Mans. Since he liked very much spiders and roadsters (and knowing the
American passion for open cars), he was also the mentor of the 190SL and
the BMW 507. In 1950 he became the Porsche distributor for the American
market; although the factory was expecting a five-car-a year budget, he
reached in three years a five-car-a-week target, great achievement for a
small car costing more than a Cadillac. Briggs Cunningham was one of the
earliest clients of Hoffman, winning the class in Palm Beach the 8th of
december 1951; John von Neumann was another famous client of Hoffman, and
purchased some  lightweight 356 SL, bodied for Le Mans. Hoffman induced
also the factory to produce in 1952 the first, legendary, Roadster America,
Glaeser and Drauz bodied. Maxie Hoffman was also the liaison between
Porsche and Studebaker, for designing and producing the  prototype of typ
547. Studebaker money (2M DM) allowed Porsche to build the new factory in
Zuffenhausen.
In 1952 Hoffman suggested the introduction of a new logo, abler than the
bare Porsche lettering to compete with the Prancing Horse or the Benz star:
Ferry replied with our beloved Stuttgart/Wurttenberg crests. The most
famous operation promoted by Hoffman was the creation of the Speedster, a
bare Reutter bodied 356 targeted for the north american market for an
under-3000-bucks price (2995 US$).
