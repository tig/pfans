I'll throw in my opinion here since I've had too much coffee to drink and
feel like rambling... :>)

I'd go with the Webers.  The CIS works well, but it has alot of limitations
from a performance sense.  It won't tolerate much in the way of
aggressive cams, and won't let you realize all of the power that can be
had from the 2.7.  I have also found the CIS to be a "sluggish".  It seems
that the engine doesn't rev really quickly with a blip of the throttle.  Maybe
it's due to the inertia of the sensor beam or something...

Anyway, I would also stay away from the MFI.  IMHO (no flames please),
it's kinda like old Jaguars, when it works, it works great, when it doesn't
well - it's a PITA.  Again, Webers, although maybe not quite as nice as a
well set-up MFI system, will work pretty well.

In the long run, the Webers might even prove to be the cheapest route.  A
fuel distributor and a couple of warm-up regulators will get you pretty
close to a set of Webers...

The only other consideration is what this does to you from a class stand-
point.  Will the car still be competitive in whatever class it ends up in?  In
my case, Webers jumps me up two classes (in PCA Club Racing) which
would *really* hurt.

Oh well, enough rambling...
