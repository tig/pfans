What size is the line to-and-from the cooler?  How large is the B&B 
cooler?
I'm installing an RX7 cooler which measures about 5"x23" and is much
longer than the other cars I've seen at the track.  I bought 12AN SS 
line
and am still seeking feedback before I decide to run my Terbatrol in
series or not.  At Pocono last week, I saw an '87 Carrera racecar with 
only a
small front cooler and 12AN lines which always runs cool in the 
NorthEast.
p.s. what do you mean by taping it to get it to 210-220?  Are you 
blocking
air-flow on purpose because it runs too cool?  The thermostat should 
take
care of that.



Alas, Steve, I've long since forgotten the exact size of the tubing 
used, but it is bigger than the RX7 coolers, which I understand are used 
by some, but restrict the flow because of their smaller I.D.  
Actually, I seem to recall that the restriction is most offensive 
when the car is cold, because the mechanical oil pump has to force 
cold oil through a restricted passage, and there is no clutch 
mechanism to take pressure off of the oil pump.  Perhaps someone 
else on the forum can explain this principle better.  I've just said 
as much as I recall from researching this issue.

The B&B is approximately 4 3/4 X 21".  It's covered with a bumper, so 
that's the best measurement I can give you without disassembling it.   
If you only plan to run in the northern climes it may not matter much.  
In Texas, we have enough really hot track days that the max cooling is 
necessary.  

I tape the grill in front to keep the temperature above 200 on less than 
hot days.  Supposedly 210 is optimum.  The thermometer opens at 180, I 
think, so on cool days it never gets above 180 or so, no matter how many 
laps I run, unless I tape it.  On hot days, I have never seen above 210. 
(Compared with the old days when I often saw 260 with the front fender 
mounted cooler only, and 270-280 without any cooler.)

I can't say what lesser cooling might be sufficient.  I just know that 
mine works.

Good luck,

	Lee Wilkins
