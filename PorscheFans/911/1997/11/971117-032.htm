Hi Porsche Fans:

    I need your help. My brother-in-law who owns a Cobra "replica", left
this joke on my answering machine today. You may have heard it before:

    Q: What is the difference between a porcupine and a Porsche owner?
    A: The porcupine has the "prick" on the outside.

    He actually left this message on my machine 2 times! And my
sister-in-law called and left it again!!
    OK, this means WAR!!! Can any of you out there help me out with a
joke I can leave on HIS answering machine relating to Cobra's? Hell,
even if you made it up and it's a good joke, I'd like to hear it. Us
Porsche owners need to unite and fight back!

    Thanks,
    Andy Zimmerman
    '78 SC Euro Targa (black on black)
