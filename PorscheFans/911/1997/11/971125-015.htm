	Seems to be the consensus, also with possibly bad shocks or
tired bearings...
	I guess un-lowering the car should solve that one way or another
then...(along with replacing the tires). Next paycheck then !

	I would tend to lean towards the "my car is too low" theory.
There are cuts on the front tires, on the side, all around. At first I
thought it was that the PO's wife hit a sidewalk or something (after
all, she did wreck the tranny).. Turns out the car is so low that the
fenders are cutting into the tires !  I guess that's low enough !  ;-) 

	Now the rear seems OK, about one inch higher than the front and
I'd assume that it's stock.
	Would someone have the stock height numbers front and rear and
an accurate way of measuring them please ?   ;-)    And recommendations
on those? I mean, if I'm going to have the shocks changed, I might as
well change to a good spec, maybe not all the way to stock, but for sure
not as low as now ! 

	>Good luck and keep asking questions!  

	Oh, for sure !  And I must say, I am still amazed at the quality
and number or answers I get. The list seems as good as the car is !
