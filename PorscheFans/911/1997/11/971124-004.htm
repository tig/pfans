Dear All,

A few questions, I have a 1970 2.2S which i have been renovating for the
past 3/4 years. I'am now up to the engine part of the project. Are there
any major areas to look for, I know about the tensioners but I have heard
that the oil pump should be upgraded to a later one????. Has anybody
upgraded a 2.2S to a 2.4S and what is involved, new pistons & liners??, is
there any point here.
I have been on the list for approx 1 year know and have seen Bruce
Anderson's name mentioned quite a lot. I'm sorry if I show my ignorance but
who is Bruce, the only great American Bruce I know of is from New Jersey
(I'm from the opposite side of the pond). What kind of books does Bruce
produce that can be purchased, either here in the U.K or in the U.S..

Many thanks,

Nick Phillips
