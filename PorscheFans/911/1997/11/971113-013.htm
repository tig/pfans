Stephenson Films Inc is making a movie about sports car racing- "Tracks
of Glory”. Any suggestions?

We could use help from volunteers located in the East or France, plus
owners of GT2 race cars and those companies and shops interested in
advertising. Filming is scheduled in the summer of 1998, in RI, MA, at
New Hampshire Int'l Speedway and at LeMans, France. 

The movie concept was based upon real life experiences of a race
instructor. The three drivers - Jim, Hank and Michelle - represent real
people who race in Porsche Club events. These characters believe they are
good enough to race in GT2 class at LeMans, France. However the movie is
a fictional story that deals with human passions, the excitement of
racing, love, commitment, overcoming obstacles, and a suspenseful,
uplifting ending. The characters are able to overcome conflict and
tragedy to achieve their personal dreams.    

For more information, visit our web site at www.stephensonfilms.com. At
the conclusion of our public offering, Stephenson Films will be one of
the few publicly owned companies producing movies. All investors will be
invited to attend filming at NH Intl Speedway.
