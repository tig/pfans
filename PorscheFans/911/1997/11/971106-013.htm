Well put, Ken.  Taking the scenario onto the track, what do you do if you're
driving a corner at the limit, and the car in front of you spins?  Nowhere
to go?  I guess it happens.

I've been struggling to learn the answer all summer.  Contrary to earlier
advice, it seems to me that an AutoX, not a Driver's Ed, is the place to
experiment.  Although better than the street, you still don't want to spin
and go off track in a DE.  But a spin during AutoX is no big deal.  Entertains
the crowd.

I've read about and been taught three strategies for recovering from too much
speed in a corner.  They certainly won't work in extreme cases, and I can't
claim to be able to perform these maneuvers with any consistency, but:

1)  If you think you're going too fast to be able to reach the apex (inside
    most point in the turn), then HIT IT ANYWAY!!!  Never ever miss an apex
    by driving wide.  Most of the time if you steer in, the car will perform
    beyond your expectations.  And if this causes a slide or spin, you've
    got much more track in front of you to work with than if you start to
    slide after the apex.

2)  Depending on the corner, and the next one, you may be able to straighten
    the wheel momentarily and brake, then turn in and complete the turn at
    the outside of the course.  I've tried this technique of putting in
    "little straights" for braking in AutoX courses with several quick turns.

3)  Use a skid to slow the car in the first part of the turn, then press the
    throttle to regain traction in the rear and complete the turn.  This
    difficult technique (for me) is one way to drive a decreasing radius
    corner.  You can initiate the skid by lifting off the throttle, or by
    riding the brakes into the corner.  If you do it right, you skid from
    the inside to the outside of the course, then throttle on, the rear
    hooks up, and you finish the turn.  The idea is that the skid slows
    the car.  I've tried it several times, and made it twice.  Its a real
    thrill when you do it right.  You finally feel like you can work with
    this rear engine car!  Another advanced technique here to recover the
    front tires from their skid is to very briefly counter-rotate
    the wheel.  I've never had the presence of mind to try this part.

Check out Hank Watts' book "Secrets of Solo Racing" for much more information
on this most interesting topic.  I hope Hank or Ross or one of my instructors
will jump in here and correct anything I've "misinterpreted" ;-)

Cheers,

- Brad
