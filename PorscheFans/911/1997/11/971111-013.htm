1) What is the preferred upgrade for an original (39K mile) clutch? Vehicle
is stock and original except for Autothority chip. And does the flywheel
always need replacement? Factory dual-mass or aftermarket lightweight or
other. Cost would be appreciated also. Need to see if I have to start
saving now:)

2) The car has the stock Blaupunkt AM/FM/Cassette. Does anyone know if the
wiring is in place for me to slide in a Blaupunkt CD changer in the trunk
or an in-dash unit. I would basically just want to mail-order something
that I could shove in about 30 seconds.

3) I never realized how loud these cars are.  Makes my old cat-free RX-7's
and 951's sound quiet in comparison. Mechanic said that it only gets worse
until the 15K valve adjustments. I noticed that the engine racket went down
a lot after an oil change. Is this typical? How long does it last before
going back to normal volume?
