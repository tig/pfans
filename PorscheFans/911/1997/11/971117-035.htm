inspecting my rear tires on my  C4 (i'm running 17" twin turbo rims with
P-Zero's) they seem to be running close to the replace time.. they seem to
be much more worn then the front's; even a bit more the the ratio of the
power distribution from front to rear.. (i'm sure 7 hardcore track days
helped the process) so my rear are at 80% worn, the front, 50% worn... is
this normal on a C4, and if it is... should i get new ones for the rear
only??, i usally try to keep sets in the same wear condition, but i'd feel
a bit guilty throwing away 2 front P-Zero's with just 50 tread wear....
(btw, i was not really impressed with the P-Zero system...  pretty low
milage tire, chunked rather profusely at the track.. good in the rain, not
good on the pocket... close to 1 grand for four... lasted summer and fall)

any suggestions welcome
