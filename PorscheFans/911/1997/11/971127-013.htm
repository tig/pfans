An old marketing research trick...if the 911 were an animal, what would the old
911 be compared to the new one?

A panther vs an over-the hill lion?

It's definitely a challenge, and I can't apply animal kingdom models very
easily.

I bought my '97 C2S when I had seen plenty of spy shots and read the specs
on the 996 and checked out the Boxster. I have no doubt the 996 is a better
car in may ways, but here's my 2 cents:

1. For $20,000 more, it should be more differentiated from the Boxster. The
Boxster's charm is in its rear aspect. It's weakest styling is where it
departed from the show car--the elongated nose with excessive front
overhang and the flattened side styling. Unfortunately, those are the parts
the 996 shares.

2. The smoothness of the 996 reflects Porsche stylists' longstanding
dislike for 'flares', but that particular 20-year tradition was the essence
of the flagship Porsche to many, as have aggressive aerodynamic aids. The
996 looks more like a conventional sports coupe than a sports car. And to
me, it looks like a committee design. Japanese cars are designed by
committees, with the exception of the Miata and original 240Z. You'd think
they'd figure that one out, quick. The 996 looks--as many here have
said--like a Lexus.

3. In profile, the overall shape is reminiscent of a 911, but the front and
rear overhangs are excessive--making the car look dated by comparison to,
say BMWs, Mercedes, etc.

4. The interior, although it has nice details, lacks the character of
Porsche's later cars. For me, the best looking interior Porsche has ever
done is that of the 928--flowing, sculptured, integrated and functional.
The straight-across bolster and dash of the Boxster/996 is reminiscent of a
late-80s Ford Escort. The oddly sculpted center pod would be at home in any
recent Taurus. The instrument cluster--to me-- is the big hit of the
interior. I think it looks great--a bit Buck Rogers, but in keeping with
the balance between flash and function. The door panel styling also seems
to be a huge improvement.

In response to another poster: yes, we can all be armchair stylists. We are
the buying public. We have a perfect right to react to new car
styling--especially if it's based upon an icon like the 911. Going back to
the introduction of Porsche's previous models, I can tell you that my
initial reachtion to each has held firm over the years--from the purposeful
but plain 914 to the voluputuous muscularity of the 928. the car I liked
best from the first time I saw it was the 993. And that's why I'm doubly
disappointed with the 996. I may feel differently when I see it in person,
but I doubt it.
