Nick, 

I recently refurbished the S calipers on my 1971 911S and it was easy.
There was enough surface corrosion that I also replaced the caliper
pistons.  After taking the calipers off the car, it was almost a 10
minute job once I figured it out.

*  I had read several warnings about using a metal tool to remove the
o-rings, so I used a cap from a bic pen -- worked great -- but I doubt
the extra care was necessary.
*  It took 100psi of air pressure to pop the pistons out (with mild
corrosion).
*  Apparently you cannot hone the cylinder wall with these S calipers
because of the plating (?).  I understood that this plating should not
be sanded/etc., but I did it anyway (very lightly) with very fine emory
paper to minimize the old corrosion.
*  On the advise of Jason Burkett at Paragon Products, I coated
everything with silicone paste before reassembly.
*  Everything I read said not to take the calipers apart unless they are
leaking, so I did not take the "small side panel" off.

2) Has anybody had any experience with referbishing 1970 911 'S' type
calipers?. Are there any do's and dont's with these calipers. Can the
small
side panel be taken off without springs etc flying out?.
