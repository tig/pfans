That should be the emissions computer. It uses the oxygen sensor to--among other
things--control the fuel flow. I know because mine died a few weeks ago. It cost $295
plus labor to fix. Steve Poole mentioned that the 1979 911's had an air pump rather
than the Lambda sensor the 1980+ SC's have. Thus pre-1980- US) cars don't  have the
electronics box under the passenger seat.
