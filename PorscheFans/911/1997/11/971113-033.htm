Subject: 	911 newbie thinks Pcars break a lot...

 David--
	Sorry you did not get a lot of help from the List. I do not remember even 
seeing your post. 
	I have had 911's for over 15 years. Yes, they are not trouble free cars. But 
they are unique, and once folks get them, they often feel other cars fall 
short. I will likely have some kind of Porsche ( seems that they have killed 
the 911 off....  :-(     -until they pull my license for old age...
	If you want a car that rarely gives trouble, I suggest a nice safe dull 
toyota or honda, maybe. But you will have missed an Experience I would not 
want to have gone through life without. If you want a 911, get one, and 
realize that everything in life is a trade off of some sort. For me, there is 
nothing that even comes close to a 911.  
	As super cool cars go, Porsches are pretty reliable, compared to the nifty 
Italian makes, etc. Also, if you think about it, almost no other car generates 
the level of fervent loyalty and enthusiasm as does the Porsche 911. Well, 
maybe Ferrari does, too, I suppose. 
 	Also consider if you will,  that there are no Honda owners Lists like this 
one that I know of (may be one, possibly, but I doubt it-- "maybe 'cause they 
don't break", Dave thinks...). There is one for Ferrari, I am pretty sure. 
	Also keep in mind that many cars discussed on the List are 20 or even 30 
years old, and some have 200, 000 + miles on them. Most car makes never even 
live that long. Many Pcars are also heavily modified, or are race cars. These 
cars may have unique troubles that a stock three year old car does not 
exhibit. On the List we discuss all these variants.
	Furthermore, remember that people usually post queries to the List when their 
cars are having trouble, Folks don't send in reports that their car is running 
fine.... No news is Good News. 
  
	Some folks are not cut out to be 911 owners. Maybe you are not. Miatas and 
RX-7's are nice cute 'n friendly little appliances, you might like one.  Good 
luck, Warren.
