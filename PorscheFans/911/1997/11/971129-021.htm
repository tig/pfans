Hi Pfans,

Can anybody give me a good explanation of what the Bosch Jetronic 
box is installed under the seat in my 1980 SC?

My guess is some kind of engine management setup.

Now the reason for asking! While I was lookng around my brand new 
purchase, I found the Bosch box, but the large plug on the front, 
(kind of like a big centronics connector) was unplugged. The car has 
been driving fine. Can the functions of this box be over ridden and 
should I be worried?

The car had a prepurchase inspection by the local Porsche dealer and 
it made no mention of this, only what a great car it was. if it 
hasn't been unplugged purposely, you would expect the dealer to find 
this as a problem.

thanks
