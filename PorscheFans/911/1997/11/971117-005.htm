Can someone on the list help me with understanding the service behavior of
torsion bars. In my mental constructs, I imagine that cyclic loading can
cause the metal to fatigue in the form of micro fractures in the bar. The
calculation of spring stiffness is determined by the dimensions of the
torsion bars, the lever arm and a constant. So the spring stiffness should
remain constant if the dimensions remain the same. However, if micro
fractures occur, then the effective diameter of the torsion bar is reduced.
The spring stiffness would then be likewise decreased by the fourth power.
Is this sound logic? My torsion bars are nearing 30 years old, what is the
service life of the torsion bars used in moderate driving. Of course the
conservative position is to replace them and not worry, but I don't
particularly wish to upgrade to larger bars at this time and it would be
foolish to impact the restoration budget to this degree if not necessary.
Please e-mail with your experience because if there is no response, I will
assume that there has been no trouble and I should not be concerned. TIA.
