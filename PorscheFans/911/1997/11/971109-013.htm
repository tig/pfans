>>Allright Pfans, so you're really on with the mechanical questions, but
>>answer this:
>>
>>What part of Bohemia was Dr. Ferdinand Porsche born?
>My source says Maffersdorf Austria.

Correct, near Reichenberg. Maffersdorf is now kown as Liberec, Czeck
Republic, and is located southeast of Dresden and northeast of Prague.

>>How about this, true or false:
>>The Porsche crest was derived partially from the Porsche family coat of
>>arms.
>I thought the stag's antlers were from the family crest. The horse is from
the
>Stuttgart city crest.

This one I don't know and was hoping to find someone who knew for sure. My
wife and I were musing about placing the Podhajsky family crest on the
steering wheel to commemorate our reassemble of our restorted Targa.
Strangly enough, my family crest does not have a horse on it.

>>Ferdinand Porsche designed gas/electric vehicles before World War One.
>The 1900 Lohner-Porsche was a 4-wheel drive electric car.

Correct, Dr. Porsche also designed the first front wheel drive car and a
gas/electric vehicle. I had to laugh the other day when I heard news that a
revolutionary car had designed which was gas/electric.

>>Walter Fricke deserves the Pfan award of the year for his superlative help
>>on retrofitting the rear swaybar.
>I'll have to take your word on this one %^)

Yes, take my word for it.

>Trick Question:
>
>Who officially has received credit for designing the Volkswagen concept?
>
>chrisc
>'72 911T

My mother-in-law terrorizes the streets of Los Gatos, CA in a pristine
Beetle that she has been offered incredible sums of money for. I should ask
her, but I think it was Hitler that received credit, and who would argue
with him?

Another trick question, true or false:
Ferdinand Porsche received his doctorate from Rensselaer Polytechnique
Institute.
