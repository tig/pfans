I don't agree with P-fans sayng the 996 can be mistaked for a Mazda;
definitely she looks porschey, closer to a 993 than a 993 to a 964. No, I
don't think the problem is if she "looks" or not like a 911. I think the
996 team was well instructed about designing a 911sh car, i.e. a car
seeming, for the present market, a 911. But new millennium (average) buyer
is very different from the past. He wants a car looking similar to a 911,
without the sturdy, military, effectiveness of a 911. The contemporary
trend is to be homologated, average people (with or without money) are
worried about being different from next door people. If Mercedes Benz or
BMWs have a tarty, unnecessary, unBauhaused interior, they want a Porsche
with similar phony-retro appearence. But the real problem is that this
approach produces, inevitably, trendy cars, as opposite to cars with an
expected life of thirty or more years. Following the trend is like riding
the tiger, a dangerous affair. Behind those (marginal) design choices are
the real problem for a car expected to be the 911 heir: a longer wheelbase,
manieristic gauges, adjustable steer wheel column, arbitrary designed
headlights (a circle or an ellipse are a circle or an ellipse for ever, you
can design an infinity of amoebas, without any reason to prefere one to
another). A water cooled engine is not a betrayal, since we had real
Porsche with water cooled heads since 917, 956, 962 and 959, but "tuning" 
a water cooled engine to sound like an air cooled is a big betrayal of the
functional philosophy of Prof.Ferdinand Porsche (why a proudly new Porsche
engine hasn't a proudly new, original, sound?). Oh, the Market, the Market,
the new Moloch for the rulers of car business. They are right, we are the
loosers, dynosaurs belonging to an elitarian era . 
Dieses ist lange her...

Aldo, more and more in love with his 964 turbo
