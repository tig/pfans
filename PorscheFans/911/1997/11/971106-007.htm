	Of course you shod buy the car even if you have to leave it outside, unprotected.  Like children, if you wait until the time is PERFECT you will be to old to enjoy them (it).  I own a '79 and while I wd like to keep it in a garage I can't yet either, I drive it year round (fun in the snow) the body is galvanized and the paint is pretty good so I don't obsess over rust- I wash and wax it regularly though.  The cars are ment to be driven.  Of course to decrease sun damage over time you may want to get a good cover for when your not using it and sunscreen for inside the windshield.
The best reason for buying a an '83 is that for much less than the average american spends on the AVERAGE new car you can get a very above average car Porsche and may find it is a lot more practical to live with on a day to day basis than you think.  And while it would hurt to leave a $60k or $70k car outside it shouldn't be painful to leave a $20k daily driver out in my opinion, certainly if the option is not having a Porsche.
