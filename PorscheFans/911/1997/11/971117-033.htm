Ron Podhajsky asks if torsion bars wear out.  Scott Winders says that,
just like springs, they do.  

Ron, who sounds suspiciously like someone who took Materials 101 in
engine school, promptly posits a mechanism (microcrystaline fractures
reducing effective diameter).  I am curious as to whether a torsion bar's
wearing out is related to a change in RATE (which would suggest
junking them unless you wanted a softer bar?  Or junking them becasue
they would soon change even more?) or to a change in something else,
maybe "set."  One hears of older cars sagging (VW vans used to haul
loads, for instance).  The sources I read usually just talk about resetting
or using adjustable spring plates to restore ride height, but they are not
discussing exacting performance requirements.  One also is adjured by
the manufacturer to release the load on the spring inside one's click-stop
torque wrench when it is not in use to keep its calibration.  Torsion bars
obviously have cyclic loads as well as static loads.  Torque wrenches
don't, at least not when they are not being used.  So is it possible for the
bar to twist slowly, especially under the static load which is always
there unless the car is up on blocks, without losing much of its rate? 
Some sort of slow deformation or creep?

All the authorities speak of is avoiding anything which could be a stress
riser (a nick in the surface, or corrosion) which would lead to a fracture
(rate equals zero).
  
To know if a bar had lost rate one would think that you would have to
measure its rate.  Perhaps that is not so easy to do on car, though, given
bushing compliance, small changes measured at low forces available
scales might be good for, etc.  Racers who use coil springs can
purchase testers (not cheap, either) to measure the coil spring's rate. 
But free height is really easy to measure.  does that suggest a change in
free height is not a suitable proxy for a change in rate?  (or a distrust of
manufacturers?)   If a coil spring looses rate when its free height
lessens (sag), would one not suppose same was case for a torsion bar
(using the postulate that a spring is a spring is a spring?)

Or is loss of rate sort of like plastic deformation in a bolt?  Once it has
happened it is a downward trend - if in ten million cycles a 400
inch/pound bar became the equivalent of a 375, it might only take one
million for it to become the equivalent of a 350? 

Just curious.
