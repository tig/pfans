Hi, Andy,

I think this might be "Victory By Design - the Porsche Story"... it has
clips of a RUF CTR at the beginning and end of the video - a wild ride
around Nurburgring... very very cool!!!! The entire video is good, but
this (unfortunately too short) section is worth the price of the video... for
me, anyway!

As far as sliding the rear end is concerned, I've heard it said that this
is the fastest way to corner a 911 ON STREET TIRES. The story is that one
of the factory guys was testing a 911 on the track and was surprised to find
that he was faster when hanging the tail out. He only realized what was up
when he got out of the car and noticed/remembered that it was on street
tires. I *think* it might have been Hans Stuck.

In other words - he's not just hanging the tail out to waste the tires or
look cool (not that it looks cool anyway!!!!)

Cheers,

Ross
