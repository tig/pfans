Nutty as it sounds, I agree with you and would be curious if you find a
source with the appropriate bulb. The ONLY good thing that can be said
of a BMW I once owned was its red lighting for instrumentation.
Apparently is a better choice of colour as it does not affect/degrade
night vision.

Will the Zenith master of this group please step forward and give me a hand. I
have a pair of  Zenith 40s on a 2.4T motor. The carbs were rebuilt and
installed. They run well except when the motor  is turned off and sits for
15-30 seconds. A slight gurgling sound can be heard from the carb on the
passenger side. Then the passenger side carb begins to fill-up with fuel. It
runs out of a series of holes in the housing beneath the venturi and above the
throttle plate. I can watch an ounce or so  of fuel fill the barrel until it
runs out of the bushing between the throttle shaft and the carburetor housing.
The fuel then runs down the intake manifold. This happens always after the car
has been run. The barrels in the carb may vary maybe only cylinder 4 will
fill-up, maybe 4 and 5 , 6 is hard to see in but judging from the fuel on the
intake manifold under 6, it leaks also.
The holes that the fuel flows out of are there to allow fuel into the barrel
when the throttle is open and the fuel is drawn in. There should be no fuel
out of these holes with out the low pressure (vacuum) created when the engine
is running. I believe that fuel is also running out of the idle mixture port.
Because it is under the throttle plate it cannot be confirmed visually , but
it shares the same channel as the leak I can see. The quantity of fuel leaked
has been enough to raise the oil level!
Things I know to be true:
1) Only the right side (passenger) leaks, could rule out a fuel pressure
problem
2) The float levels are correct , set with a see-thru float level gauge.
3) I have tried new needle valves and a lower than stock float level(no
washers)
4) No parts have been left out
5) The auxiliary enrichment system has been disabled 
6) The Idle jets are larger than stock 55 vs. 47.5
7) I have tried another carb housing and top (with different floats)
Any ideas , thoughts , or past experiences, (do I call a Priest or a Weber
sales person)  that may be of some help please mail me with some advice.
Thank you,
Randy
