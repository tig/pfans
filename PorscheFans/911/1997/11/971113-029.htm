All,
I was at the event and saw the car.  The front was pushed to the drivers
side 5+ inches and three of the four corners were flattened.  The fact
that the two occupants came out okay (the driver was cut on the forehead
when the helmet pushed off past his glassses) is a tribute to the design
and build of our cars.

The explanation that was discussed the following day during the morning
driver's meeting  was the instructor was going out with a student and in
their rush did not secure their helmets.  Working staging we made sure
ALL participants had their helmets secure before allowing them on the
track.  I know, we should have been more diligent prior to mishap.  I
must say I did not talk to the people directly and more information
could be available.

There was a lot of conjecture just after the accident that the helmets
were pushed off the back of  both occupants.  Try this sometime with an
SA95 helmet, with the proper fit.   We did at the event, and I can't
imagine it happening without significant trama to the neck and chin of
the wearer. The cut to the forehead from the glasses would be consistent
with a front to back ejection, also.  Just my $.02

P.S. Sorry I included all the prior message but I thought it might be
important to repeat.
