Hello Folks. I just purchased a 73 911T that has (I found out later) a =
2.7. The previous owner didn't drive the car too much and he said that =
the engine has had "a top end job". I don't have too much faith in the =
"top end job" because the guy could not provide any paperwork that =
described the work that was performed. The engine seems to run pretty =
strong but it is kind of difficult to start in the morning. Also it has =
some serious oil leaks that appear to be coming from the crankcase =
(front pulley seal) and oddly enough I noticed today that the nuts that =
hold the crankcase halves together near the rear end were actually =
slightly loose. I snugged them up but not too tight. I have no resources =
for these questions except what anyone out there can provide so I assure =
you any advice will be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!
