> In Mark's post he had asked how I had determined that I had a fuel
> distributor problem and what I did to fix it.  Some of the regulars
> may recall that I've had a long running love / hate relationship with
> my CIS system.  In Mark's case he had an injector not seating which he
> was able to fix with cleaner.  I poured enough Techron in my tank to
> float the car, changed the injectors, removed and vacuum checked the
> airbox, runners and boots.  Checked the primary and warm up regulator
> pressure a couple of times and last disassemble, cleaned and adjusted
> the air plate and fuel distributor piston.  What I was left with was a
> rich running engine that ran well but still had sooty plugs.  If I
> leaned the mixture adjustment the idle would pick up as I would expect
> but I would then get a range of back firing followed by a miss if I
> continued to lean it.  I didn't take much to determine that the
> missing cylinder was specific to one output port of the fuel
> distributor and not an injector.  My suspicion at this point was that
> one of the differential pressure diaphragms had failed or stuck.  As
> some may know these are factory repair only and run around $400 for a
> rebuilt unit.  
> Just to make sure I hadn't overlooked the obvious I decided to check
> the fuel lines from the distributor to the injectors for an
> obstuction.  I removed the line from the injector on the offending
> port and put the end in a can expecting to get fuel out of the line
> when I undid the fuel distributor end.  No fuel.  I checked the line
> next to it and got fuel drainage as expected.  I looked at the copper
> seals for the banjo fitting and found the lower one to be a steel wave
> washer instead of a copper seal.  Can you say "air leak"?? I've seen
> similar air leaks in brake lines where you get air into the system but
> fluid doesn't leak out.  I didn't have time to warm the car up (30
> degrees F) but hope to see if my mystery is solved over the upcomming
> long weekend.  I sure can think of something else to do with $400.
