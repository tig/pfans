David,  don't know what type of alarm you have, but the factory unit with the
door
key to me is adequate.  

This is on the key-lock type on my '95 (you lock the door manually by
inserting
key in door lock).  The newer cars apparently have a more sophisticated unit
available (option 530) with a remote locking/unlocking unit with an
immobilization
of the FI and starter and no apparent door switch for the key.  I read a tech
bulletin on this, and it scared the daylights out of me.  if the battery in
your remote unit
fails, you have to remember a 4-digit number, pry the plastic caps off the
door
locks, then go thru a 2-page procedure to open doors, insert key in ignition,
then 
flick key on and off in certain sequence to code in 4- digit number - all
done in
about a 2 minute window  or else the alarm will sound for 3 minutes and you
can't
shut it off!

Hi Porschefans,
Does anyone have any knowledge of the 993 factory alarm system.  Does it
pay to install an additional aftermarket quality alarm system?  I've
always had aftermarket systems, viper etc. with many convenience
features, and mostly no problems, but I'm a little nervous to continue
to do so.   Any thoughts and experiences would be appreciated.

Respectfully
David Klein
