> A little history:
> I have just purchased a 1979 930 (previously owned a 1982 928S, 1985/2
> 944, 1986 944, 1985 928S and a 1980 911SC).  Everything on the car was
> stock and it was driven very little (38,832 miles to be exact) so I
> couldn't say no to the purchase.  There were a couple of dings and chips in
> the paint and a
> couple of surface rust spots where rock chips took off the paint and
> exposed the metal underneath.  Due to the age of the paint, I am having a
> body shop take the car down to the metal and reprimer and paint it the
> original color (dark blue slate) and replace all of the outer seals.  I'm
> adding new H-4 lights and lowering the car.  Since the car was sitting for
> long periods of time, I am having my mechanic replace all the engine
> gaskets and seals as well as updating the chain tensioners, tuning it up,
> doing leakdowns, and valve adjustments (basically a major service).  I have
> added new stainless steel heat exchangers and a 4 1/3" dual outlet exhaust
> system to get more horsepower and a meatier sound.  I have also upgraded
> the turbo and am now probably pushing around 350+ HP from the stock 265.
> 
> My three questions:
> 1) My mechanic was wondering if I wanted to replace the stock air filter
> system (it being so bulky and large), with, I am assuming, a K&N system of
> some sort.  I have heard that doing so will increase my horsepower a bit
> more (+7-10HP) and provide 37% more air for the engine.  I have also heard
> that during hard and heavy rains and car washes that water can get into the
> engine and cause the engine not to turn over and risk damage.  Is this true
> or am I reading about something completely different?  Should I change my
> air filter system?
> 
> 2) What are some opinions on the Weltmeister Cambermeister strut brace?  Is
> it worth it?  I will be doing some track events, as well as racing the
> quarter mile (hoping to make it into the 11's), but mostly street/highway
> driving.
> 
> 3) Anything that I should be aware of about the 1979 930's regarding
> oversteer, maintenance, peculiarities or FYI's?

>  Adnan-     It is very, very easy for a novice to wreck his first 911. Many 
> do. I almost did when I got my first rear engined buggy 15 years ago, but I 
> was very lucky. If an inexperienced 911 driver lets off the gas and/or brakes 
> in mid turn, or even applies so much gas as to break loose the rear wheel 
> traction, the back of the car may well pivot around like a pendulum, and then 
> you and the car leave the road backwards. This can happen very quickly. 
> 	This actually happened to me on a rainy night less than two weeks after I 
> bought my first 911. At about 45 mph, I came around a curve, and I saw a 
> branch down in the road; I swerved and braked to avoid it. In a split second, 
> I was spinning 360 degrees, and all I could do was wait for the outcome. I was 
> much more fortunate than many, as I slid across someone's lawn and came to 
> rest in his hedge... I had to paint a fender and door,   and buy eight new 
> hedge bushes... pretty lucky, wouldn't you say? The more recent cars such as 
> you are considering buying, are somewhat more forgiving, but they are still 
> rear engined 911's. It can still happen. Be careful, but have fun. 
> 	One can still cut safely with a sharp knife, or go skeet shooting with a 
> loaded shotgun; for me, the awareness of some danger makes for a more 
> exhilerating experience. If not, I would drive something competently dull, 
> like the  Nissan Altima you mention. I recommend getting some advice and help 
> from experienced 911 pilots. Join the PCA and go the driver's ed classes,
