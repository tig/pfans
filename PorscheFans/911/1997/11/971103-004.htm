Seeking better handling, I thought that installing swaybars in a =
previously barless 69T targa would help. Procuring aftermarket 15mm =
bushings for the used factory bars I bought from another member of this =
list was difficult. The Automotion catalogue suggests 19mm swaybars both =
front and rear for improved handling. The book "How to Make Your Car =
Handle" by Fred Puhn describes the home manufacture of swaybars. I =
purchased 4130 chromoly bar stock from Aircraft Spruce and machined the =
front bar using the factory bar as a pattern. The rear bar was more =
difficult requiring four bends in the 19mm bar. The factory bar provided =
a pattern for where the centerlines should be at the attachment points =
but the bend radius had to be larger due to the increased diameter. A =
slight modification accommodated this. The insides of the bends were =
heated to a yellow color over a distance of about 50mm along the bar =
before applying pressure. Surprisingly enough the bars finished out =
beyond my expectations for $30 worth of materials (not including =
bushings) and an afternoon of work. Fred suggests heat treating the bars =
to a tensile strength of 160,000 to 180,000 PSI which my conversion =
computes to 36 to 40 Rockwell C. Can anyone suggest a heat treater that =
can handle this size piece for a reasonable price? All the local ovens =
can only handle pieces smaller than 36 inches. I will post the handling =
results after installation and testing. I would appreciate any feedback =
you may have on any aspect of this endevour.
