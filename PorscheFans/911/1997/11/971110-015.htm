I had a similar problem with my 85 911.  My conclusion was that the
idle was set too high.  The PO had set the idle high because the
car would stall.  I fixed the real problem.  Dirt and vacuum leaks.
Remove and clean the idle positioner.  Remove, disassemble and clean
the throttle body assembly (special attention to the idle air bleed
screw).  Find and fix vacuum leaks.  I attached my shop vacuum to
the air box and used smoke to look for leaks.  This took a long time
but the result is a nice stable idle and no $$$ spent.

>Hallo,
>
>I own a '85 Porsche 911 Carrera, with 3.2 engine (DME injection
>system). Over the last few months I experience problems with the idle.=

>Each time I engage the clutch the idle drops to 100-200 rpm (or stalls=

>when I have the aircondition on) and than rebounds to 800-900 rpm.
>Occasionally the idle goes up to 1400-1500 rpm and only after some
>driving it falls back to the correct 800-900 rpm.
>
>I have checked / cleaned all electrical connections and cleaned the
>idle positioner (or is it called the auxiliary air valve) without much=

>result. When I disconnect the idle positioner the engine picks up
>nicely, so it looks as if its working. Any advice whether it could be
>anything else than the idle positioner is welcome.

>Thanks, Dirk
