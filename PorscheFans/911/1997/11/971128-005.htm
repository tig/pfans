Am I the only one who has seen the 1998 Supercup version of the 996?  
Any doubts I had about the 996 being a Lexus/or Mercedes SL kind of 
car were erased. If the basic platform is targeting a market which 
expects more comfort and room than "traditional" 911s offer, so be 
it.  

The boy racer version has flares, wide tires and all the usual 
stuff that makes a 911 race car look so good.  I'm very confident that 
the flares and things will be made available to us perhaps in a Club 
Sport version, same as the C2S and C4S gave us the widebody and 
matching wheel/tires.  It also proves Porsche's statement that the 
future race-cars will be 911 based and not Boxster variants.  In one 
regard that's off, one could make a heck of a racer out of a Boxster 
with its mid engine configuration. I presonally still lust after a 
Porsche 904 which was build off the 914 platform I think.

I'm going to enjoy my 993 and bide my time for a while.  By the way,
in Supercup livery (wild paint job) there is more than a little 
family resemblance to the GT1.
