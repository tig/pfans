Hey Fellas:
    I hope someone out there can help me out.
    I have a '78 911 SC Euro Targa and the brakes are squealing. They
don't squeal unless I apply the brakes and only if I apply them lightly.
They don't seem to squeal as loud or even at all if I apply them firmly.

    My first thought was the pads must be worn. Well, I've taken off all
4 wheels and looked at the pads and they all look fine. They all have
about 3/4 of the pad left. I know this because I compared them on the
car to the replacements I bought (before I actually checked them!).
    Anyone got any ideas??? Can anyone offer any comments or
suggestions? Bleed the brakes? Calipers not releasing? Pistons sticky?
Also, my parking brake doesn't work very well (ie: the car still rolls).

    Thanks in advance,
    Andy Zimmerman

P.S. On another subject, does anyone know where I can find an antenna
"coupler" that converts the thicker plug from the replacement antenna to
the thinner type that will plug into the wire comming from my Blaupunkt
stereo? I've been to Radio Shack and the local VW dealer with no luck
whatsoever. - Thanks!
