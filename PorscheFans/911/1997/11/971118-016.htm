	Morning porschephiles ! 

	I didn't want to make a fuss yesterday so as not to jinx it (the
buyer could have changed his mind).. But no...I drove my first 911 home
all the way from sacramento yesterday night, not the best time to get
acquainted to a new car (indeed I froze my butt for 1/2 hour until I
lucked out with the fan controls and got some heat (the location of the
controls for heat is like on my karmann ghia!!!, couldn't find the dome
light either..). I was quite nervous driving it back as there are many
more gauges to look at and I am still unfamiliar with their normal
behaviour... But all was fine !  Didn't miss a shift..well, one time I
got neutral instead of fourth, but I was just being cautious ! 

	I have a porscheload of newbie questions, please forgive me
because I am sure they were asked before:

	- The oil pressure gauge.. Ahem... Cold engine, it registers
zero and stays there for at least 10 minutes as I drive at constant rpm
(fwy). If I stop, after 5/110 minutes, if will register middle to 3/4
full in neutral... Is that OK ? Yesterday at sustained 80mph , it was in
the bottom third after the car got warm. And it bounces a lot ! 

	- Druck ?  Is that like instant pressure ? That was pegged at
3.5 the whole trip. 

	- Is it me or is there a light in the passenger footwell that is
turned on when the headlights are on ? 
	- The steering wheel seems to vibrate a bit too much ...
(slightly lowered car, no pwr steering, hard shocks). Could it be that
plastic thing on the steering column the list was discussing a while
back ?  I'll balance the tires anyway....

	- Ok, the car's got 114 K miles, purrs like a cat, what's the
deal with hydraulic chain tensioners ? If it lived this long without
them.... ????

	- Is there a manual for climate controls in a FAQ somewhere ?
;-) 

	- I can shift straight, no double clutching, no rev matching,
(the tranny is new). Should I do the previous anyway to preserve it or
is it OK to just shift it normally as long as it lasts ? 

	- Second gear is in my driver seat, I know what you guys were
talking about now ! 

	- Lugging it ? under which rpm ? It wasn't comfortable when cold
under/at 2000 rpm. More like 2500/3000. Fine, but do you damage it at
2000 ?  (not that I plan to drive it like this, but I want to know)

	- Saw a recommended maintenance section in the car's latest
paperwork : Blower motor (something unlegible) and injector leak (more
unlegible). Trouble ? 

	- Idles at 800 rpm, cold, warm, starts warm and cold (so far).
not a drop of oil in the garage this morning. Compression 175 170 170
170 170 175 , leak down 5% all cyl. 

	Now if I could stop grinning from ear to ear, it's starting to
be painful ! ;-)
