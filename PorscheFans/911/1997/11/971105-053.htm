Thought I should share what I feel is my secret (VERY recently discovered
so it's hardly a secret yet) for heel/toe in a 911.

When I first got my car (August) I finally understood why so many people were
writing in with heel/toe problems. I just couldn't do it because the brakes
are so damned good that on public roads I wasn't braking hard enough to get
the brake pedal down FAR enough to make heel/toe comfortable (I am,
incidentally, in the "toe on the brake, cock foot counterclockwise, heel
on the gas" school of heel/toe).

I adjusted the gas pedal BACK a bit (just a wee bit and I checked the throttle
stop afterwards to make sure I wasn't bangin it), it helped a tad, but only
a tad.

Then the revelation. My leg was the problem - I couldn't get my heel on the
gas because my ankle didn't bend enough because my leg was at too high an
angle.

Solution? Simple. DROP THE SEAT AS FAR AS IT WILL GO.

My leg's at a better angle, my heel now reaches the gas, and I can heel/toe
as with any other car I've owned (with a floor-hinged accelerator pedal).

No fancy pedal extensions needed.

It may well not work for everyone - my legs are surely not the same as yours,
but if you're having heel/toe problems, give it a shot - who knows...

That's my fear too. I even find in spirited street driving that the pedal
drops JUST A BIT too far and my foot is in danger of catching the gas.
Recall, though,  that I raised the gas pedal a BIT (no more than 1/8 inch
at the turnbuckle).

I've clipped the rest of Hank's GREAT book on heel/toe for brevity - but
I will try the Parnelli approach clutch in, neutral, clutch out, blip, clutch
in, gear, blip-and-clutch-out-at-almost-the-same-time. I don't care for
the Bondurant approach - mainly because I don't think I'm skilled enough
to do this!!!

Cheers,

Ross
