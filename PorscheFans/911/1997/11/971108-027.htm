    Andy:

    The squeal's caused by the pad vibrating against the caliper. To
    cure it, go to your local auto-parts store and tell the guy that
    your brakes are squealing and you need some of that blue goo that
    goes on the back of the pads... He'll know what you mean.

    Remove your pads, coat the back of each one, and reinstall
    them... The squeal will go away.

    -Andy

    P.S.  If you prefer, you can also get special shims that go
    between the pad and caliper... Tweeks and Automotion sell them,
    and maybe your local auto-parts store does, too.
