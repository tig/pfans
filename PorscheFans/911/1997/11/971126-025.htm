the new 996's less-than-drool-inducing styling:

To me what Porsche has done is a 928 replacement, not a 911 replacement.
Remember when the 928 came out - Porsche told us how much better it was than
the 911, the press told us how much better it was than the 911, only the
people buying the cars didn't care. The 911 was unique, it had character, a
undefinable presence. The 928 bombed, the 911 flourished.  I hope for Porches
sake I'm wrong or there may be no Porsche for long.

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whatever one may think of the new 996's looks, or Porsche design and
engineering in general, one must question the effetiveness of their marketing
(beyond, that is, the ridiculous but effective "there is no substitute"
crap).

I own a late '86 (S4 brakes + ABS) 928 S 5-speed, and I am a member of the
928@porschefans list.  True, the 928 was not the marketing success that
Porsche hoped for, but 60,000+ cars and a 17-year run do not constitute a
"bomb."  Like all manufacturers in the early-to-mid-70's, when the 928 was
conceived (before the 924, remember), Porsche was facing enormous uncertainty
regarding crash standards (different, as we all know, fron "safety"),
emissions, noise, and both fuel availability and economy.  There was also
great monetary uncertainty as the USA let its currency float, among other
issues.  Remember also that, at the beginning of the 928's design, the
"icon-ization" of the Porsche, M-B and BMW brands -- which led to
ossification of "traditions" like rear engine/air cooled design -- had only
just begun.  Given these circumstances, Porsche did about as good/bad a job
of predicting the future as could be expected.  Their one major mistake was
waffling between a true 2-seater like the 911 (don't tell me that the 911 has
reat seats!) or a true 4-seater, ending up with the wrong size car for either
purpose.

I suspect that the Boxter/996 product mix is deliberately designed to bracket
the existing 911/993 product.  The Boxter -- especially with the obvious
planned upgrades including more power, 6-speed transmission,
speedster/targa/coupe variants, etc. -- will be the sports car.  The 996 will
be a "bigger/cushier/heavier-than-a-911-but-not-as-big-as-a-928" product.

Porsche would pay me a LOT of $$ if I could prove in advance that this was or
was-not going to be a marketing success and tell them for how long the
current rosy sales picture would last.  Since I can't, I'm "stuck" --
  ~~;^-)   -- with my 11-year old 928.

I suggest that, as far as Dr. "Me? I vasn't a Nazi!" Porsche A.G. is
concerned, for long-standing 911 fans, you are better off viewing the Boxter
as the true "new 911."  I just wish they'd drop the "development" B.S. and
give us the REAL Boxter -- big (3.0?) engine, 275hp, 6-speed -- right now.
