Morning folks,

First, thanks to all who responded to all my annoying questions. I
frankly did not expect that much info, those being newbie questions and
all, but I was overwhelmed by the volume, and am very much appreciative
of all yout help !  

My car is out of the shop with new tensioners (collective wisdowm
prevailed), a couple of new gaskets here and there, and new flexible
aluminum tubes (dunno what they are called but they're new now, maybe
that'll cure the oil smell with the heater)... Heater blower motor was
fine, just missing a fuse (how dumb was the previous mechanic?),
injectors fine also after all...
Total $996... Acceptable...

I am left with the vibration in the steering but my mechanic thinks it's
the tires balancing....
Sooner of later, I want to de-lower the car anyway so I'll do the shocks
then...

I was told my catalytic converter was gutted (for more perfs), that
sucks because the PO told me it was  sports exhaust, not a gutted
exhaust, but I am broke right now so it'll wait, but I wonder how it
passed the smog then !  (with flying colors too, must be a very clean
engine !!!) 

The mechanic also confirmed the car was never invlvedin any accident,
and was just plain mint ! In fact, he was drooling all over it so I had
to let him drive it a little...always good to have a friendly
mechanic... Boy I feel better !  There's always that risk that you got
@#$@# by the previous owner ! 

Once again, thanks to all for your help and patience ! 

Greg. 

83 SC

PS: gotta find an empty parking lot now and test the limits of adhesion
!!! Everybody keep telling me I'm gonna wreck the car if I don't do
that...Fine...
