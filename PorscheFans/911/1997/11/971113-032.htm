Hi Rick- 
	I also have an '81 SC. The oil temp guage needle does not move much in my car 
either, never has, and I have had my car for many years. My mechanic says I am 
lucky, as she runs fairly cool. The car has the fan upgrade that was standard 
for that year (11 blade?) and I have been told the '81 SC's seem to run 
slightly cooler and smoother than the earlier SC's, apparently due to somewhat 
different emissions control arrangements than the older cars had (no smog 
pump) . 
	Temp indicator at rest cold is in the lower middle of the white box, and when 
operating under normal conditions, it is at the very top edge of the white 
box. Total movement here is minimal, like 1/4 inch.  The only time my car's 
temp needle gets much above the white box' upper limit is when stuck in 
traffic with AC running (I live in FL), or when the car is operated at 
prolonged high rpm's. Runs cool on the highway, only gets warm if I run her 
above 90 for while. (that's kilometers, officer...). Highest I have ever seen 
it was still 1/4 inch below the red zone at top of guage. My guess is you are 
lucky like me and also have a cold blooded 911...
	By the way, I recently learned, from a tip on this List, that on our 
'numberless guages', that if one looks at the guage from an extreme side 
angle, one can see tiny celsius numbers at the outer edge of the guage.
	Congratulations on the purchase of an '81 SC. I enjoyed a contented 
relationship with my '81 Coupe since 1984. The car has been very good overall 
and a genuine joy to own, and the only real trouble zone has been the lame AC. 
If you have an experience anything like mine, you will be a happy man. Good 
Luck and Happy Porsche-ing,    Warren .
