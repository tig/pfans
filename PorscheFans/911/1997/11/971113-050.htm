David-
	Yours is a common question on the list, and you're right, it rarely gets
answered. I don't remember your original post, but the advice on how to buy a
911 could fill a book, it's a very difficult question to answer in a
Porschefans post. 
	Call Classic Motorbooks, 1-800-826-6600. They have several books available
that I can recommend. "The Used 911 Story" by Peter Zimmerman. This is a good
technical breakdown of all the different years, and how to buy without
getting taken. "The Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide" by Dean Batchelor is
good also, with less technical info, more on options and differences between
the years. It has all models, not just 911's. "Original Porsche 911" by Peter
Morgan is very good at showing the changes through the years, and all the
options available-great color pictures.
	Excellence is a good magazine, and also check out the PCA Potomac website,
along with the pages of other PCA regions.
	You will notice a lot of repair questions on the list, but we don't need the
help of others when our cars are running fine. Look at the model year of most
of the 911's, most are at least 20 years old, with a minimum of 100k miles.
Many are daily drivers, something you won't find with other makes. Good Luck
in your search.
