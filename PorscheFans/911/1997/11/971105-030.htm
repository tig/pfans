I usually let my 86 Targa warm up about 5 minutes...and then I drive it slowly
(3-4000 rpm max) for about 10 or 15 minutes depending on the outside
temperature.  I live on a side road that leads to a major highway around here. 
So I take car to warm up the car before I have to pull out into traffic that's
doing anywhere from 60-90 mph.  Overnight temps usually are not below 40 around
here in the winter.

I bought an Evolution 4 from Automotion (www.automotion.com).  It's fairly
water resistant (it doesn't absorb water).  My 86 Targa doesn't have any kind
of awning or garage to park under so it's out in thw weather all year (worst
weather we get here in California is heavy rain, which is rare for my area
anyway).  The Evolution-4 is a 4 layer cover.  It hasn't scratched the car
since I started using it about 4 months ago.

I have a funny (well, some of my family thought it was funny, I was mad!) story
about the cover.  A friend was over and brought his dog (I have cats btw, which
love to run all over my Targa and the Evo-4 has kept them from scratching it!).
 His dog is a couple years old, maybe 30 pounds...I was busy in another part of
my yard and walked by my Targa to find this dog sleeping on my hood.  I
carefully picked it up and removed it, then yelled at it a bit...now it stays
far away from the car...but good news was that it didn't do *any* damage to the
car...not a scratch, thanks to that cover.

Before I bought the Evolution-4, I called Automotion explained that I had cats
that would scratch the car so I needed the thickest cover available.  I think
if you call them and tell them what you need they could recommend a cover.  The
only bad thing about the Evo-4 is that isn't pretty large, takes up a good
portion of the trunk.
