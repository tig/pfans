>thanks,
 well lance you asked so here goes. In 88 I just about fell over the 
deep end with the thought of owning a 959, what a car. then the 
reality sets in, way too much $. Ah but my years of body work can
lead to artistic creation. Oops I had never made a fiberglass mold.
Looked at the conversion kits and some were butt ugly. Settled in with
Getty Design out of Santa Ana, final generation of molds are excellent
Built my car out of a 74 911s targa, cut the bar, full fledged convertible.
The front end,bumperand fenders are bolt on, one piece. Rear 1/4s
are a combo weld and bond. Recent post concerning bonding has
appeared, I have not had a delam or seam show problem. One has
to be patient with construction. If you want a really straight car, do the 
body work and let it sit for 2-3 monthe in the sun, then block it out and
do it again. Another tip is to cook your parts, really bake them so as
to release all that styrene. I alluded to not knowing how to make frp
parts, that has all changed. My shop relocated on a large lake in NH
and boats are a boon! Now I know very well the process. Gettys parts
are the best I have ever assembled given a hand lamination as 
opposed to SMC( Which turbo tails and other factory parts are of)
Anyway costs for conversion-dissassemble,attach,refinish,reassemble
is an honest 12k, parts are 4.5 of that. You will also need a wheel/tire
package. My personal car had 345/35/15 avs yokls on the rear that
were an absolut blast at the autox. I have done a few with references
 available. If there are more questions give me shout. Be happy to
answer the experience. Car was way cool on the street....
