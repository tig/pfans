Hello again,
    I have gotten some good information on a couple of questions previously,
and hope I will have similar luck again.

    Here is my dilemma. I am currently rebuilding my '72 Targa 'E'. I have
completed the tranny, and am currently completing the steering and suspension
rebuild. My engine parts are out being machined and most of the new tidbits I
need have been purchased.
    Now that I have gotten this far I am beginning to think about repainting.
The car history is reasonable, with the original owner having the car from new
till '93. His records were excellent. The next two owners seem to have just
driven the car with little to no maintenance, and I purchased the car in July
'96. I have noticed a couple of points that made me question which way to go.
There is bit of rust starting to peak out from the rear deck at the fold seam,
and there are a couple of bubbles in one of the fenders. Aside from that just a
couple of scratches and nicks from road debris. The body is in extremely good
condition for a 25 year old car.
    I would like to hear pro's and con's for dipping the entire body to strip,
and possible costs. Otherwise what are the good and bad of a area strip, repair
and repaint of the entire car. I don't want to be cheap, but cost is a
consideration, and I really don't relish the idea of pulling out absolutely
everything. 
    One other issue that stands out, is that I am starting to see the
undercoating begin to flake away from the inside of the wheel wells. can this
be touched up or does it need to be replaced. 

    Please let me know about your experiences and knowledge of similar to help
me make up my mind, and thanks in advance for your help. I would also like to
find someone in the Dallas area that others would recommend.

Regards,
