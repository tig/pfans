Morning folks,

Why is it you always finds the little bugs after you've bought the car,
never before ?  ;-) 

Anyway, no biggie - I hope, but my sunroof seems to be very slighlty out
of alignment. This shows in that the felt strip that goes around shows
has about 2 millimeters of space on the back (driver side) and seems to
compress the front a little too much on the driver side, the alignment
being fine on the passenger side. So it seems (from the back of the car)
that the sunroof is slightly twisted to the right (once again, this is a
very small thing). it operated perfectly, BTW.  There's a faint scratch
mark on the sunroof which IMO suggests it' s been jammed and "fixed".
Is there a way to realign this correctly ? I want to replace that felt
strip that goes around, the front part seems easy enough (although, what
glue would I use ?), but the rear section (attached to the sunroof
itself) seems to be a pain... Any idea ? (for alignment and replacement
of the felt)..

I am taking it in tomorrow for upgraded chain tensioners and general
checkup.... Can't wait to get the go ahead from my mechanic and start to
really drive it !   ;-)
