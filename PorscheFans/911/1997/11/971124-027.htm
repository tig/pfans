Hi PFans!

All this talk about misbehaving PCar blower motors, plus the bracing 
weather, encouraged me to check for proper operation of this beast in my 
'83SC.  Low and behold, 12 volts plus at the connector but no noise from 
the 
fan.  I've noticed no difference in the operation of the heating system in 
the 3-plus years I've owned it, so I guess it has never worked.

I get decent flow from the vents when underway, so I guess air is "ramming" 
into the fan inlet and moving the heated charge forward.  I would like to 
fix this though.

I remember some posts to the list within the last few weeks describing R&R 
for the blower motor. The assembly almost looks accessible!  Any words of 
wisdom?  Also, who has the best price for this unit.  The best I saw in a 
recent Pano was $158.

In a totally unrelated matter, has anyone found a source for touch-up 
quantities of obsolete PCar paint?  PCNA says light broze (Heilbrunz) 
metallic touchup paint is not available.  And I do not need (yet at least) 
quarts or gallons.

TIA for any help

p.s.  Say Vol, can you tell me how to reset the default volume level on my 
SGI Octane?
