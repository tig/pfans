I've been following the thread about the puff of smoke and have a question.  What does the smoke smell like?

When I start my 1967 2.0 L at home (about 8200 ft), I get the smoke and it smells like gas.  When I start it (cold) in Denver (~5280), I don't see the smoke.  I've always assumed that the car was running very rich and leaned out a little as it warmed up.  I didn't think that I was dealing with oil burning off.

This has happened on two engines.  The original engine with 300K+ miles on it (maintainence history unknown) and on a 1969 911S engine with unknown miles on it.
