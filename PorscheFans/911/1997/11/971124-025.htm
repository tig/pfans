Dear 911 list

Other than old Porsches -- my newest is a '66 911 with 1/4 million miles
which I have owned since 1970 and 4 other Porsches, oldest '52 coupe (15 year
restoration almost done and a tractor -- my interest is collecting Porsche
books.  To support this habit -- probably the largest English language
Porsche book collection in the world I am Porsche specialist book dealer.

Further I write the revies column for the 356 REGISTRY and used to write the
book reviews for EXCELLENCE until I was told they only wanted positive
reviews.

In any event, I have become distressed with several information related
threads by the user's group.

The Haynes 911 manual is NOT an adequate substitute for the original factory
shop manual.  If you are going to work on your Porsche or even if you only
want to understand that which your mechanic tells BUT the factory shop
manual!!!  The parts manuals are neat because they show the parts in exploded
views.  Call your dealer, I don't sell new shop manuals.


Classic Motorbooks is an excellent source, but if you can live with checks
rather than charge cards and want actual recommendations call me; my prices
are usually 20% off list.


PORSCHE 911 FOREVER YOUNG, Aichele               55.00      69.95
the best 911 history written

Porsche 911 Performance Handbook ed 2, Anderson 17.00     19.95
fantastic value, good history, excellent on recomendations 

PORSCHE 911/912 64-73 AUTHENTICITY                 18.00     19.95 
PORSCHE 911/912 74-89 AUTHENTICITY                 18.00     19.95
only places to find what really came on the cars

PORSCHE 911 STORY                                               35.00
    59.95
the 2nd best and best with technical information

Used 911 Story, Zimmerman                                       15.00
    17.95
small over priced book -- except when you are buying a used 911, 5th edition
just out

The Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide" by Dean Batchelor  15.00       17.95
filled with inaccuracies.  4th edion just out.

Original Porsche 911" by Peter Morgan                          28.00
     34.95
superficially appears to be an excellent book but as with all English books
has too many errors.  But it is decent at showing the steps involved in
several major repairs.

Excellence is a good magazine -- especially the technical articles
Also consider the Up-fixin series put out by the PCA -- compendia issued
every few years of tech articles form the PANO


Please don't hesitate to contact me directly -- I'll sell you any book that's
available but I'll also advise you on what's decent.
I have a book list available.
