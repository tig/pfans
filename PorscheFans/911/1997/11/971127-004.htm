If you've replaced the "air box" with a K&N cone, you don't have an air box
and don't have to worry
about it.  The air box referred to is on Bosch K-Jetronic injection
equipped cars (pre '84).  It sounds 
as if you have the Motronic (EFI) system.

The air box in the K-Jet cars is subject to being blown because
all air being fed to the intake runners is routed through the bottom
chamber of the air box after the
throttle.  In the event of a backfire, the pressure gets pushed back up the
intake runner into the
sealed plastic box.  The pop-off valve is spring loaded and allows the
excess pressure to be vented
to the upper chamber (where the air filter is).  If the box is blown (not
literally in most cases) unmetered
air leaks into the lower chamber causing the mixture to run way too lean
causing the engine to run
poorly, at best.

Hope this helps...
