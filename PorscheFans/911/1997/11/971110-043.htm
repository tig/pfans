My brother was just told by his mechanic at a respected Atlanta area =
German car shop that 993's (an example of which he owns)are exhibiting =
abnormal camshaft (lobes?) wear. That this mechanic attributed it to the =
use of synthetic oil instantly calls into question his credibility, =
however. Nevertheless, If anyone has any information on this subject, or =
would like to refute it, please chime in.
