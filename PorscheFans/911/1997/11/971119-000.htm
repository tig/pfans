Gregory,

Welcome to the group.  I'm replying probably because your introduction
brought back such vivid memories for me that I couldn't resist.  That first
drive home when you know that you're going to break something or have an
accident.  Fortunately neither occurred.  I suggest reading the owner's
manual and some other books (e.g., Bruce Anderson's and or the Haynes manual).

I've addressed your comments in CAPS below.  Remember to include your
e:mail in your signature.

	Morning porschephiles ! 

	I didn't want to make a fuss yesterday so as not to jinx it (the
buyer could have changed his mind).. But no...I drove my first 911 home
all the way from sacramento yesterday night, not the best time to get
acquainted to a new car (indeed I froze my butt for 1/2 hour until I
lucked out with the fan controls and got some heat (the location of the
controls for heat is like on my karmann ghia!!!, couldn't find the dome
light either..). I was quite nervous driving it back as there are many
more gauges to look at and I am still unfamiliar with their normal
behaviour... But all was fine !  Didn't miss a shift..well, one time I
got neutral instead of fourth, but I was just being cautious ! 

	I have a porscheload of newbie questions, please forgive me
because I am sure they were asked before:

	- The oil pressure gauge.. Ahem... Cold engine, it registers
zero and stays there for at least 10 minutes as I drive at constant rpm
(fwy). If I stop, after 5/110 minutes, if will register middle to 3/4
full in neutral... Is that OK ? Yesterday at sustained 80mph , it was in
the bottom third after the car got warm. And it bounces a lot ! 

I THINK YOU ARE MISTAKING THE OIL LEVEL GAUGE FOR THE OIL PRESSURE.  YOUR'S
SOUNDS PERFECT.  YOU CHECK THE OIL LEVEL WARM, WITH THE ENGINE IDLING FOR
ATLEAST 45-SECONDS.  ONE MORE THING; DON'T TRUST THE GAUGE ONLY, USE THE
DIPSTICK, CHECK THE OIL OFTEN (THEY USE OIL), AND MAKE SURE THE REPLACE THE
DIPSTICK IN THE "TUBE" INSIDE THE OIL FILLER.


	- Druck ?  Is that like instant pressure ? That was pegged at
3.5 the whole trip. 

THIS IS YOUR OIL PRESSURE.  SHOULD BE HIGHER WHEN VERY COLD, THEN WHEN WARM
SHOULD DROP TO APPROXIMATELY 1 BAR PER 1000 RPM.

	- Is it me or is there a light in the passenger footwell that is
turned on when the headlights are on ? 

DON'T KNOW, MINE DOESN'T HAVE THIS "OPTION".  CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE GLOVE
COMPARTMENT LIGHT IS OFF AND THAT THE DASH LIGHT ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE IS
OFF.

	- The steering wheel seems to vibrate a bit too much ...
(slightly lowered car, no pwr steering, hard shocks). Could it be that
plastic thing on the steering column the list was discussing a while
back ?  I'll balance the tires anyway....

MAYBE, IF THE WHEEL MOVES ALOT WHEN THE CAR IS STATIONARY CHECK THE
"PLASTIC THINGY".  IF IT IS WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION, INSPECT THE TIRES
FOR WEAR AND BALANCE AND THE WHEELS FOR TRUENESS (IS THAT A WORD, NOT!)

	- Ok, the car's got 114 K miles, purrs like a cat, what's the
deal with hydraulic chain tensioners ? If it lived this long without
them.... ????

READ THE FAQ OR A PORSCHE BOOK.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER YOU'RE
LIKELY TO HEAR THE RATTLE OF DEATH UNLESS THE TENSIONERS ARE REPLACE.  BUT
DON'T PANIC.

	- Is there a manual for climate controls in a FAQ somewhere ?
;-) 

FROM AND OLD POST:

*****
It seems quite quirky, but after a while the simplicity is useful.  Here we
go:

	The 3 levers:
		1. Controls fresh air only.  All the way left means NO fresh air, center
means fresh air using no fan, to the right fan assisted with 3 speeds.

		2. Controls the output of the fresh air (windshield or feet).  Left for
feet, right for windshield.

		3. Controls the output of heated air (windshield or feet). Left for feet,
right for windshield.


	To control the amount of heated air, use the two levers next to the
parking brake.

FOR BEST HEATING AND COOLING, MOVE THE TOP LEVER TO THE LEFT.  THIS SHUTS
OFF THE UNTREATED AIR (E.G., COLD IN WINTER, HOT IN SUMMER)
****

	- I can shift straight, no double clutching, no rev matching,
(the tranny is new). Should I do the previous anyway to preserve it or
is it OK to just shift it normally as long as it lasts ? 
YES, ALL OF THE TRANSMISSIONS SEEM TO EXHIBIT DIFFICULT SHIFTING.  DOUBLE
CLUTCHING HELPS WITH SHIFTING.  LEARN THE CAR, THEN GRADUATE TO THE FANCY
TECHNIQUES.

	- Second gear is in my driver seat, I know what you guys were
talking about now ! 
YEP.

	- Lugging it ? under which rpm ? It wasn't comfortable when cold
under/at 2000 rpm. More like 2500/3000. Fine, but do you damage it at
2000 ?  (not that I plan to drive it like this, but I want to know)
YOU'LL BE UNLIKELY TO DO ANY DAMAGE AS LONG AS YOU'RE COASTING OR VERY
LIGHT THROTTLE.  USE MORE RPMS WHEN YOU WANT TO ACCELERATE.

	- Saw a recommended maintenance section in the car's latest
paperwork : Blower motor (something unlegible) and injector leak (more
unlegible). Trouble ? 
NOPE, BLOWER MOTOR PROBABLY MEANT THE CAR HAD LITTLE HEAT OR NO A/C.
INJECTOR LEAK IS PROBABLY NOT SERIOUS GIVEN THE AGE, JUST REMEMBER THAT
WHEN YOU HAVE SOME OTHER PROBLEMS.

	- Idles at 800 rpm, cold, warm, starts warm and cold (so far).
not a drop of oil in the garage this morning. Compression 175 170 170
170 170 175 , leak down 5% all cyl. 

SOUNDS GOOD.

	Now if I could stop grinning from ear to ear, it's starting to
be painful ! ;-) 

WELL DON'T STOP.  I HAVEN'T.
