 Dipping is great if your making a race car. otherwise your 
looking to invest in huge quanities of advil (or drug of choice).
I dipped my GT2 car. I found only one place in N. Cal that does it, 
due to EPA regulations. Eats everything, even weak metals. 

  But the fun part is that it doesnt evaporate quickly or for that matter
slowly. So as you weld, we hit pockets of left over stuff. or you 
find that one little area that somehow holds what seems to gallons of the
crap.  And you find those little rubber grommets that you forgot! 

 Great idea for a track car, but if your doing a street car.. eh.. no way. 
way too much work. ;>
