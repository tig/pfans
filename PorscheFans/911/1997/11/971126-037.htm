I have a '68 912 and love it. There are people that think this is the
last of the true porsches as it has the same basic engine as the 356.
The 912 motor can be built to be quite fast as the engine weighs less
thus requiring less horsepower to push the car as fast. If you speak to
some they will tell you you can build the 912 motor to push the car
faster than an original 911 of its time. I find the engine to be easy to
work on myself and the parts are not hard to find. There are experts
that can help in the rebuild with lots of lit on the 356 power plant.
Other than the motor everything else is the same as a 911 (and the 912
emblem).

The draw back is nobody has herd of the 912 other than true porsche
enthusiasts.

I love the 912 and it has been fun restoring mine.

If you have any questions feel free e-mailing me I would be glad to
help.
