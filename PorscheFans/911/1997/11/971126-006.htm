I am not a convert yet either.  Being a marketing researcher, I don't
get the need to change the instrument cluster either.  Guess I grew up
with the cluster that way and am used to it.  Perhaps the marketing
researchers (who do they invite for these clinics?  Lexus SC400
owners???) noted that this cluster might be confusing?  I sense that
most of us didn't buy a 911 for the excellent Honda like ergonomics...or
did we?  We bought them because they are beautiful, obnoxious beasts.

I for one think that you can't make a Porsche generic.  It can't be
generic because a car in low volume must have personality.  An old
marketing research trick...if the 911 were an animal, what would the old
911 be compared to the new one?  The old one, no matter how refined,
always commanded respect...like a tamed wild animal that could still
chew your head off if you didn't pay attention.  The new one seems more
like a well trained labrador.  I don't want my Porsche to be a lab.
I'll buy a Honda..they're tame and friendly.  Sure hope the new one
develops a beastly personality.  The 928 never did.
