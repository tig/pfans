I think the hydrolock issue arises only on cars with aftermarket
carburetors and (naturally) aftermarket air filters.  The factory air filters,
if my not all that good memory of peering into other's engine bays with
factory carbs or factory MFI serves, are generally big suckers which are
heavy, take up a lot of space, and cause the air to go around various
corners.  All good reasons for a hot rodder to discard them (Automotion
in its catalog touting K&N calls the stock filter housings ugly), except the
factory issue won't usually convey any water to the vicinity of the tops
of your carburetors or whatever, as they had this in mind when
designing them.

The after market versions, even the K&N Watershields, will allow water
to get onto the air filter base plate, at least under some conditions.  Water
in this area has several ways it can get into the carb and hence into the
engine, if there is enough of it.  Or at least the reported experiences of
some on the list say so, and I have found some minor water within the
filters after hosing things off without covering the filters sufficiently, so I
can believe that if more got in, problems could arise.

However, I also have a K&N in my CIS engine.  Since rest of system is
stock, you'd have to point a hose directly sideways into the air intake
snout to get much water in there, and even then I don't think it would
work its way into the engine.  If you put a K&N in the stock filter
enclosure of a 3.2, same deal, and you'd expect same for a turbo. 
Supposedly lower resistance with equally good or better filtering, plus
you never have to buy new filters (instead, maybe you just have to keep
buying K&N filter cleaning/recharging kits?).  So no apparent drawbacks
if you keep it stock other than the filter itself.

I think I have seen pictures of a supposedly less restrictive K&N for some
later model applications (not for CIS, that's for sure) where you take the
stock filter housing off and install a big conical K&N filter in its place,
sticking out horizontally.  I suppose one benefit of this is that the air
doesn't have to make as many twists and turns before entering the filter
and intake,  which case simple minded volumetric efficiency theory says
should be good.   If I were contemplating this for a street engine, I would
examine the plumbing to see where water would go if it got through the
oily K&N material (which it seems it can do).  If it can find a way gravity
can take it to your intake valve (as with carburetors), I'd maybe worry, or
at least always cover it up if engine got so oily or dirty the car wash
method of cleaning it was indicated.  If the intake rose some before
turning down toward whatever counts, I'd not worry as much -
whatever gets in the top of the filter maybe can just leak back out the
bottom?

Just my thoughts on this.
