Looking to buy a used 911 with the following characteristics:

911 Coupe (ONLY), any model back to '74 ok
Full rollcage completed
3.2L motor or better
I want most of the mods needed for Time Trialing completed
    (fire system, belts, fuel cell, etc)

Trailer desired also.  Max 2000 lbs (I only have a Ford Explorer)
    Closed would be great but a good buy on an open one ok also.

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Willing to consider any
reasonable car in good condition.  I can't afford to build from scratch
so I prefer to buy!!  Email details directly to me at:

jts@home.com (home)
  or
jeffs@vitalsigns.com (work)

Have 1992 Turbo for "possible" trade. See it at:

in the process of installing a stereo in my 1970 911T. I'm curious =0Aabo=
ut the experiences of others in the placement of speakers and =0Aother co=
mponents in early 911s. .....>=0A=0AHere are some notes from my installat=
ion in my project car.=0AI just installed a Kenwood cassette stereo in my=
 69 911T. Since the original=0Aradio cutout for these years was for a twi=
n shaft unit, I had to cut out the=0Aradio panel opening to accept the DI=
N size stereo and fashion a brace for the=0Aback side of the unit. Discar=
d the DIN sleeve that comes with the stereo. You=0Awon=92t need it or hav=
e room for it.=0A=0AAs for front speakers, you=92ll find the inner door p=
anel (the metal part) has a=0A5 1/4=94 opening for a speaker. You can act=
ually install a 6.5=94 speaker in this=0Aopening (the cone dimension of a=
 6.5=94 speaker is 5.25=94 ... double check the=0Aspeaker). The larger sp=
eaker should give you a little more bottom end. Just=0Aadd a grill on the=
 door panel (the fabric part). Find a grill that=92s more or=0Aless flush=
 with the door panel to avoid interference with the window crank=0Ajust a=
bove it. Mounting the speakers in the doors means you=92ll have to drill =
a=0Ahole in the door jamb to run the wires inside the vehicle. For a clea=
ner=0Ainstall, use rubber grommets in the drilled holes. You can even go =
to the=0Atrouble of finding color coded wires that blend in with your pai=
nt color. My=0Acar is white so I used a length of white heat shrink tubin=
g around the speaker=0Awires that show in the door jamb.=0A=0AI=92m using=
 a set of Infinity 6.5=94 CS600 separates. I flush-mounted the tweeters=
=0Ain the front kick panel material just above the map pocket next to the=
 door=0Ajamb. Yes, I did cut a hole in the factory material (I hope Ferde=
 allows=0Athis). To keep the material from sagging, I took a piece of gal=
vanized sheet=0Ametal, cut a hole in it the size of the tweeter and sandw=
iched it between the=0Atweeter mount bracket and the soft kickpanel mater=
ial. You can surface mount=0Ait too if you want (less cutting). More expe=
nsive tweeters provide an=0Aangle/swivel mount for the best directional s=
ound. The crossover boxes are=0Acrammed into a crevice behind each kickpa=
nel. This setup keeps each tweeter in=0Aclose proximity to the midrange c=
one. In the rear, I picked up one of those=0AMoch I rear speaker enclosur=
es for the back shelf (used). It had a pair of=0ABoston Acoustic 5.25=92s=
 in them already. =0A=0AWhile I had the car apart, I added sound dampenin=
g material to the interior.=0AYou know, the DynaMat stuff. Instead of the=
 real thing, I found some=0Aequivalent material from J.C. Whitney. It=92s=
 cheaper, looks and does the same,=0Abut without the logo printed all ove=
r it. I covered the floor area with it=0Aafter removing the factory insul=
ation blanket and some floor pan rust from=0Ayears of outside storage. I =
also cut some pieces for the door panels. I could=0Ahave gotten carried a=
way here. I just wanted some sound dampening without=0Aadding a lot of we=
ight. I=92ve read of car audiophiles lining the entire=0Ainterior, trunk =
and wheel wells with the stuff.... about 300 lbs. to the=0Avehicle weight=
..=0A=0AThe setup sounds pretty good with the engine OFF. With the engine =
ON, I can=0Ahear the radio, but since this is a Porsche there is a defini=
te mix between=0Agood audio sounds and good engine sounds... with engine =
sounds predominating.=0AYou have an early 911 so you know audio quality o=
n the road is relative. I=0Adon=92t have any experience with a sub-woofer=
.. Aren=92t there sub-woofer units=0A(non-cone type) out there you can mou=
nt under the seat? It seems to me the=0Asub-woofer should be inside the p=
assenger area. I know, not too much room for=0Aextras.=0A=0AMy system doe=
sn=92t have an amplifier ... yet. Mounting the amp under the seat=0Amay m=
ake connections to the speakers and head unit easier. A CD changer might=
=0Abe my next upgrade. Hope this helps.=0A=0ASherwood Lee=0A(So. CA)=0A
