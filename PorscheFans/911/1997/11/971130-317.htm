Tom, it's been 8 years since I worked on a CIS-equipped car, and I do not
have
any more technical info. From your description, I think the airbox is blown,
but 
can't be certain.  To my knowledge, you can remove it, but you might
have to unbolt the rear engine mounts and lower the engine to get some 
clearance (something like an inch or so).

Wish I could be more help.  Maybe someone else on the list can.  Good 
luck!

 I pulled the air cover and filter off and found several screws loose on the
body housing -- a couple inside and two on the side.  Does this indicate that
the airbox is damaged?  One of the inside screws seems to have stripped
threads.  All else looks ok.  Is this something I can do myself?  Without
pulling the engine?  There's not much room in there.  Thanks for the help.
