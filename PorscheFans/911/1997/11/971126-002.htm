HI PFans,

I picked up my 1980 911SC today! Coupe with leather trim and 16inch 
Fusch wheels.

As with most of the "just got it" stories, I took it real easy on the 
way home, just making sure I monitored the gauges and making sure 
everything is ok. Oil pressure was in line with the 1 bar per 1000 
rpm rule, and oil temp only went up to 3/4 when I was stuck in 
traffic for 15 minutes. Once I got her on the tollway at a gentle 
100km/h it went down to half and stayed there.I was pretty happy with 
the temperature as it was over 100F in Sydney today. The aircon was 
also ice cold which i understand is a miracle in itself! Looks to 
maybe need some oil though so i'll be undertaking my first "checking 
the oil in a 911" routine tomorrow. 

The gearbox feels pretty good and I didn't seem to have any issues 
with finding 1st gear at any time. Concentrated on nice slow changes 
on the way up, and double declutching on the way down. My brake pedal 
is a little far in front of the accelerator pedal to use my usual 
style so it looks like I'll be needing to come to grips with a new 
foot position but I can live with that <g>.

When I got home my wife wasn't that impressed, she thinks 
"it's not very practical". Still wants to drive it though<g> My four 
year old daughter loved it and pestered me all through dinner 
to let her go out and sit in it. She's a Pfan in the making! Her best 
comment was "it looks like a fast racing beetle car, daddy". Very 
perceptive.......

Does anybody have a paint code decoder? The little paint code sticker 
inside the door says    376 9-3

The car is a US import and is a, and I don't want to get to technical 
here, a bluey/greeny colour. I saw an 83 Cab in the identical colour 
on the road yesterday. If you can tell me what the official name is, 
I'd much appreciate it.

Anyway, thanks to all those on the list who helped me out while I was 
in the buying process. Your input was very valuable.
