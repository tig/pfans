Terry,  thanks for your comments. Yes, I remember my mechanic, who also builds 
race cars, mentioned the DOT certification, or lack of said, when he discussed 
the stainless lines with me. He felt that they were a good option nonetheless. 
They seem to have firmed up my pedal feel in what I consider a good way. The 
old (original) hoses were causing trouble with impeded backflow of the brake 
fluid, as tiny scales of the inner hose liner material were acting like little 
one way reed valves, and thus kept my brakes partially applied... I thought my 
impression of decreasing power was the result of the advancing age of my '81  
911, but in fact I was unwittingly driving around with my brakes on (feel a 
little silly admitting this). The SC is pretty quick once again, so in effect, 
the new brake lines have rejuvenated my car!
	 Yes, obviously there is a rubber line inside the braided steel mesh, haha... 
Good point on the abrasion factor. Some years ago I mounted an oil cooler on 
an '84 VW GTI  I had, and used stainless lines. I noticed that, after about 
5-10,000 miles, the stainless mesh had almost worn through the lower radiator 
hose, as the engine's vibration and torquing about in its rubber mounts caused 
a "filing" action to occur at the point where the hoses touched. I moved the 
oil line and wrapped the (now new) radiator hose in a protective segment of 
the old rad. hose just in case. Incidentally, that little GTI was a great 
little car to commute to work in... Warren.
