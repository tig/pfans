Well I disconnected the battery and I could not operate the locks.  So I guess
my car didn't retain the mechanical locks? (it's the factory central lock
setup)

I'll have to add this somewhere.  I have one of the 9v battery adapters that
plug into your cig lighter so you don't loose radio presets when changing
batteries etc so I'll probably modify one of those (my radio doesn't store
presets internally) and hide it outside somewhere.

Thanks for the info.
