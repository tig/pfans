<< Folks,
 If things go according to plan, I will be the proud owner of a 78' 911
 SC on Saturday. I have a couple of basic questions, hope I can get some
 help from the veterans.
 1) Driver Ed School, I am really interested in going to a Driver's Ed
 school. Problem is I live in the Midwest (Moline, IL) and would like to
 know what is the best way to go about doing this in our 'El Nino'
 stricken weather. How long do I have to wait before they start offering
 classes in Ohio or IL. Any contacts I can have to get some info, email,
 www sites, phone numbers. >>

If you don't already belong, join the Porsche Club of America (PCA).  Your
local region is Central Iowa and the current President is Mike Massell in
Iowa City (319-364-4956,or pick up a packet at Lujack's, the Porsche dealer
in Davenport.  Ask Mark Pilon).  You can also write the PCA Executive Office,
PO Box 30100, Alexandria, VA 22310 for membership ($36 per year, give your
vehicle VIN).

That region is quite small and cannot sponsor Driver's Ed courses by itself,
but the Chicago Region is very active in driving events using both Blackhawk
Farms and Road America at Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin.  Once a member of PCA, you
can enter other region's driving events which are advertised in the club
magazine Panorama.  Several regions use Mid-Ohio at Lexington, OH for driving
events.

You will have to be satisfied locally with "low speed" driving events around
the Quad Cities at this time of year.  I believe the Central Iowa Region has
one last autocross event for the year.  Tell Mike I suggested you call him.

Perry
