A first hand account would be more useful information.

I have had the unfortunate experience of landing chin first on a road after 
being hit head on by a Jeep Cherokee while riding a BMW motorcycle.   The 
impact speed was estimated to be 45mph.  My helmet stayed on despite an 
impact that was heavy enough to crack the shell in the chin area.   No, I 
don't remember much about how I hit but I do remember a pretty good impact.   

Given this experience,  and other falls that I have seen during motorcycle 
racing,   I find it hard to believe that an airbag is going to remove a 
proper sized and secured full face helmet.   If it did have enough force to 
do that I really don't think I'd want my face in the way of it.

This seems to be one of those ancedotes that those that don't use full face 
helmets use to justify what they do.    I wouldn't think about getting on a 
motorcycle without a full face helmet and I don't think I would do a 
driver's ed without one either.

Having said that it would be interesting to hear other thoughts about the 
advisibility of disabling air bags during Driver's Ed events.   I understand 
that it is very easy to do on a 993.   I think I'm going to keep mine on.

Cheers.
