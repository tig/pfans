I paid the deposit today on my brand new used car. A 1980 Porsche 
911SC. Yeah! (well, if it passes the mechanical inspection ok, but 
I'm confident)

This is my first 911 and I have a couple of questions. 

How long does the car need to be "warmed up" in the mornings? I live 
in a reasonably warm climate (Sydney, Australia), overnight temps in 
winter of around 32-40F and in summer of 40-48F.

Does anybody have any favourites when it comes to car covers? I'd 
like to get one that is mostly waterproof. The car will be parked 
outside, under an awning.

Any additional info you folks might have that i need to be aware of 
will be very appreciated.

thanks

terry
