I hope Andy Warren will forgive me, but here's a post he made a while
back regarding SS lines...


There are three reasons to install stainless-steel brake lines:
 
1.  They look racy.
2.  They don't swell like rubber lines, so they can potentially firm
    up your brake pedal.
3.  If you're doing a lot of off-road driving, the stainless-steel
    braid may protect your lines from being punctured by rocks or
    whatever.
 
Here's the thing, though:  Since stainless-steel lines don't bulge as
they age, and since the inner Teflon lining is hidden behind the
braid, there's no easy way to inspect the lines for warning signs of
imminent failure.  This is no big deal on a race car, since the lines
are (or should be) replaced at least once a season.  On a street car,
where most people are likely to let YEARS go by without even looking
at their lines, it can be an issue.
 
Plenty of people, therefore, warn that you should use rubber lines
instead of stainless steel... They'll be happy to give you anecdotal
evidence of steel lines simply bursting (or, more commonly, separating
from their hose-ends) catastrophically with no warning.
 
I haven't seen any references to this sort of failure that mentioned
whether the lines were:
 
    REAL Aeroquip or Earl's hose,
    attached properly to the CORRECT hose-ends, and
    installed properly on the car.
 
I define "correct hose-ends" as Earl's Speed-Seal (the new name for
Fluor-O-Seal) or Aeroquip Super Gem, and "real hose" as Earl's
Speed-Flex (the new name for Fluor-O-Flex) or Aeroquip... uhh... I
forget their brand name.
 
Anyway, Speed-Seal hose-ends work just like Earl's Swivel-Seal ends;
the hose-end can swivel after assembly.  The nipple/cutter assembly
on these ends (and on Aeroquip Super Gem ends) was specifically
developed to prevent blowoff of the hose-end... I'm still waiting to
hear from anyone who has firsthand knowledge of one of these hose
assemblies coming apart, and until I hear from that person, I run
"real" stainless-steel lines on my car and replace them regularly.
 
THIS IS IMPORTANT:  The lines that your performance-parts distributor
will sell you are made with no-name hose from God-knows-where
(probably Taiwan), and the hose-ends are just swaged-on fittings that
are an invitation for disaster.  I won't put these on my car, and I
don't recommend that you put them on yours, either.
 
There are now "DOT-approved" stainless-steel lines.  I have no idea
what they are, but I suspect that they STILL use cheap-ass crimped-on
hose ends.  Until my suspicions are disproven, I won't put THEM on my
car either.
 
If you decide to put stainless-steel lines on your car, you need to
be aware of a few things:
 
    1.  When you install them, you must make SURE that they can't
    kink, twist, or stretch under any combination of wheel droop,
    bump, or (for the front wheels) steer.
 
    2.  The stainless-steel outer braid will cut through anything
    against which it rubs, so you have to make sure that the lines
    don't rub back and forth over anything important.
 
    3.  Stainless steel lines have been known to fail when dirt gets
    between the outer braid and the Teflon lining... As the braid
    moves back and forth, the dirt abrades the Teflon and can make
    it rupture.  If you look at stainless-steel lines on motorcycles,
    you'll see that many of them are encased in plastic tubing,
    apparently in an effort to eliminate this problem.  The tubing
    also helps considerably with the abrasion issue mentioned above.
 
Good luck...
 
-Andy


Hope this helps!
