>Well, sort of.  One of the P.O.'s really did a number in this particular
>area.  I've had to
>rewire most of the car based on info that I've found from here and there.
>The front
>lighting harness was pretty easy as was most of the dash, but there are
>still a few
>unknown wires to trace down.
>
>>The blue lead with a yellow tracer appears to go to the RPM transducer.
>The
>>coil and fuel pump as well as the fuse lead breakout of a WECO connector.

>Ah - there's one problem.  I was looking for the blue/yellow to go to the
>fuse box, assuming
>that the red leads all terminated in the engine compartment.  With my
trusty
>toner in hand
>I quickly traced back the third red to the #6 position on the fuse box.
>
>>If fuse 6 is not getting power then the terminal connector into the
>>dash may not be making contact or the ignition switch is faulty. This is
>>assuming that all wiring in between is intact.
>
>
>Problem #2: No power to fuse #6 when the ignition is switched on.  After
>hooking up the
>meter and checking one of a couple of loose wires I found the 'switched'
12V
>lead.  Everything
>works great!
>
>>Unfortunately, as you may know, the wiring diagram in the Haynes Manual
for
>>the '69 is only for the E and S. Most of the diagram seems to be
applicable
>>to the T but does not show the fuel pump or coil connections correctly.
>
>Yup - been there before...
>
>>Please contact me if I can be of further assistance.
>
>Thanks for all the help Ron.  Thanks to you, the total time in tracking
down
>this problem was
>about 5 minutes (versus who knows how long tracing wires without your
help).
