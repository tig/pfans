<SNIP>	 I understand that, when the old chain tensioners start to go, I
will hear a 
fairly loud and distinctly unusual new sound at low rpm's, from the
loosened 
chains . This noise, I am told, will likely go away at higher rpm's when
the 
chains take up the slack from rotational forces, but I personally doubt
that 
operating motor at higher rpm's with loose chains is a brilliant solution
to 
this problem, haha. The theory is, if I catch it early and limp the car to
the 
mechanics (or flatbed it!) I just may get away with it.-- At least this is
my 
understanding of the situation...
	 Funny, generally, I am not a gambler, except on stocks...!    

	-Was there an upgrade that came stock with the SC's?    I am not sure. 
	-What the heck are these "guards" I hear about?    Don't know exactly....

	PFans: responses/criticisms definitely solicited here!   Warren.

The info about the sound you hear is correct.  This happened to me on my 75
targa.  Damned loud rotten noise that would decrease as rpms went up. 
Thank god I was only 1/4 mile from my wrench when it happened.  I asked him
if I could drive it home. He immediatly reached in took my keys marched
into his office and called a cab.  Said he would give me a call when he was
done.  Dont want to butt heads with this German.
