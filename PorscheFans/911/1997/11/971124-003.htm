    The last time this came up, I trolled for flames with, "No
    way... Honda's high-end sports cars look MUCH better than the
    996."

    The 996 still doesn't look like a Honda to me... At worst, it
    looks a bit like the Toyota Supra.

    That's what they said when the 911 replaced the 356, and when
    the body style changed in 1974, and when the C2/C4 was
    introduced, and again when the 993 came out.  Just as we've all
    gotten accustomed to those body styles, I'm sure that we'll get
    used to the 996 eventually.

    Besides... Even though the 996 isn't quite as goofy-looking as
    previous 911s [here I go with the flame-bait again...], it STILL
    won't be mistaken for anything but a Porsche.

    If it makes you feel better, think of the relationship as "40%
    of the Boxster parts are interchangeable with the 911".
