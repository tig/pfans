Greetings,

I'm in the process of installing a stereo in my 1970 911T. I'm curious 
about the experiences of others in the placement of speakers and 
other components in early 911s. I bought 5 1/4" component speaker. 
For now I'm putting them in a spare set of door pockets that I bought 
from a friend. These were already mangled by some p.o. who put 
speakers in them so I don't need to worry about damaging them. I was 
told, however, that for killer sound I should make some enclosures to 
place the speakers at the kick panels under the dash. I experimented 
with cardboard mock-ups but I just don't think that there's room there. 
Has anybody ever put speakers there????

 I intend to put my  power amp in the compartment next to the gas 
tank in the trunk (this IS called the "drug compartment", isn't it?). 
Anyway, has anybody ever experimented with putting a sub-woofer 
in this same compartment???

Sorry for being so verbose but any advise or tales of previous 
experiences would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks,

Joel
