[I'm replying to old mail from the dark interval of digestness.  Please
forgive if this has been dealt with.]

Despite the story below, Americans didn't invent cars, either, of course.
Daimler and Benz, independently invented cars ni 1886 in Germany, 
Benz having had the decency to invent the motorcycle first (still a
puzzling fact, why he would think to put a motor on two wheels before
four; maybe just fewer things to deal with . . .).  Of course, both the
original cars were OPEN cars, making all these coupes a bunch of
revisionist craziness.

About Tyres and such ... 

An englishman and an american are talking about a car. The brit 
points to the winshield and says " the windscreen is cracked". The 
yank says "that's a windshield not a windscreen".  The other responds 
"in england it's a windscreen, that's a boot (points to the trunk) 
and those are winky winkies (nods towards turnsignals)".  The 
american shakes his head and says no, those are a windshield, a trunk 
and turn indicators.. besides, I should know, america invented the 
automobile.  The englishman pauses a second and says " I beg to 
differ, because while you yanks may claim to have invented the 
automobile, we invented the language!".

May that put an end to the debate <grin>?
