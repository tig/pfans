Hi All,

RE:"Volney Spalding" <vol@espresso.corp.sgi.com> comments on startup =
smoking


My '83 SC did not have this problem for its first 150K miles or so, by =
227K it was happening every now and then, but was definitely burning oil =
on highway and under hard acceleration.  This is when I had the engine =
rebuilt, new rings and bearings, old pistons and cylinders, complete =
rebuild of top end new valves, guides etc.  For first 5K engine did not =
smoke at all, after that it went though a period where it blew smoke on =
every first start in morning (I took this to be the rings seating in).  =
Now at 250K it has the random smoke in the morning maybe 20% of first =
starts and occasionally a middle of the day lunchtime smoker (very =
rare).  My engineering sense tells me that this is a ring tolerance =
issue due to the fact that the aircooled engine has more temperature =
variation sensitivity than say a small block V8.  Just my opinion :-)  I =
doubt that it has anything to do with oil level.
