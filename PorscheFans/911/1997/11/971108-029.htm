Merlin:

There are two problems with increasing the caster angle.  The first 
one's minor: it'll increase your steering effort.

The second problem is larger:  When you increase caster, you increase
the mechanical trail distance... That's why more caster increases the
steering wheel's self-centering effect.  The increased mechanical
trail, though, tends to overwhelm the PNEUMATIC trail, which makes it
harder for you to sense, through the steering wheel, the point at
which the tires are about to break away.

You know how the steering gets real light when the front tires are 
right at the edge of adhesion?  With a lot of front caster on an 
otherwise-unmodified front suspension, you may not be able to feel 
that any more.

My advice would be to try increasing the caster angle, but pay
attention to how the car feels at the limit and be prepared to
change it back if you can no longer feel what the car's doing.
