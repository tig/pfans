Snip> They run well except when the motor  is turned off and sits for
15-30 seconds. A slight gurgling sound can be heard from the carb on the
passenger side. Then the passenger side carb begins to fill-up with
fuel. >

I'm not a master by any means, but this sounds like a problem Webers
also experienced called perculation. E.G. the carburators heat up from
the engine and when the engine is turned off, the heat transfer causes
the gas to boil and perculate out.  Weber had a fix for this that
involves drilling a hole in the top of the float bowl to relieve
pressure. Another solution was to install some insulators (six) under
the intake manifold flanges.  UpFixin has articles on all this. Warning:
I understand several engine fires resulted from this problem.  You might
call PMO (advertises in Pano) for more info.
