I originally bought the Haynes manual, then the service manual on fiche,
then purchased the AllData CD ROM, then finally a used set of hard-copy
manuals. Here is my experience with each.

The Haynes manual is based on an early car, perhaps an early seventies, with
addenda for the later models. It is way too terse and omits steps and
details that the factory manual points out in great detail. I do find that
it sometimes clarifies what the factory manual says by presenting a
different sequence of steps and pictures for a given task. By itself, it is
adequate for tune-ups and routine maintenance.

The full service manual can be obtained on fiche as noted below. It is
produced in negative (background black, text white), though, which doesn't
affect the readability of the text but renders the pictures mostly useless.
It is also tediuous if you need to "flip" between several different pages,
since there is no way to "Bookmark" a fiche reader. You can, however, print
out individual pages at the fiche readers of many libraries. At a dime a
page, this would still be less expensive than the printed factory manual, if
you had the time to spare to print it all out.

The AllData CD-Rom was a major disappointment. The only thing that looked
like it came from the factory manuals were the wiring diagrams, and they
were incomplete, missing several pages. The rest of it was even less
comprehensive than the Haynes manual. Its organization was "clever" but not
really helpful. I have not used it since I purchased the full service
manual.

The factory service manual is the bible. I bought mine used and find it was
a very good investment. My only criticism is that the torque specs for some
bolts is difficult to find. I have resorted to the torque table in the
Haynes manual for a couple of bolts. However, I would not attempt any major
work without it. So far I have done the clutch and transmission and found it
very helpful.

BTW, I also have the parts list on fiche and find it also to be very
helpful. Last night I was removing the RS America brake calipers and
reinstalling the stock ones. I needed to know whether there was a washer
under the bolt heads of the stock setup. I looked at the fiche and, voila,
there it showed the wavy washers in the exploded diagram of the front
brakes.

I bought my fiche reader used for $50. If I had to do it again, I would look
for a reader that accomodated the larger, European size fiches.
