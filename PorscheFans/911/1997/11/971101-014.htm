My friend has a 90 C2 and would like to lower the car. He wanted me to
post
this question to all that have experienced this process.  I have told
him of
the wealth of information I have gotten on my ill 72T.   He would like
to know
of the proper way to lower the C2 and what parts are needed.  snip...

Tom:
I lowered my C4 last winter using H&R progressive springs.  It was a
pretty easy job to do in my garage.  I recommend air tools or a very
large breaker bar for the lower rear shock mount, though. :^)  Tell your
friend to do some research on the spring rates before he buys.  Some
vendors like H&R simply increase the rate 20% to start and increase
progressively from there as the spring compresses under cornering, etc.
They also shorten the length so the car sits 1.5 inches lower.  I find
this comfortable for a street C4, your friends spine may be different.
Suspension set up once the car is lowered is also critical to handling.
Take it to a shop and have the car corner weight balanced and 4 wheel
aligned.  I found setting the suspension to Carrera RS specs had a major
effect on the terminal understeer of the C4.

The Eibach springs, lower the car 1-1.5 and the front spring rate starts
out below O.E. and progresses to 40% past it. The rears start at O.E and
increase to 40% under compression.  I haven't ridden in one but I
suspect this would give a softer ride and less understeer.  I don't know
about the Porsche options other than the M030 Sport suspension springs
which are 40% stiffer than stock in the rear with heavy duty shocks all
around which will also reduce understeer.  I understand RUF has a
suspension kit that uses shorter shocks and springs along with revised
sway bars that is considerd a good handling upgrade and lowering
upgrade.

I would have your friend call one of the performance shps in advertised
in Pano to discuss what he is trying to achieve with the lowering, just
a better look, which can be done cheaply and easily or significant
handling changes, which could escalate the $$$.
