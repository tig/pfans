In a message dated 11/9/97 7:22:49 PM Central Standard Time, you write:

<<  Is it necessary to
 substitute all of the front suspension or can the existing A-arms still be
 used? Are the hydropneumatic strut assemblies completely different than the
 conventional set-up? There is definitely no source for the seals to repair
 the failing struts? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. >>

Some, but not all a arms have the splines necessary for the torsion bars.
 You are probably in luck as yours is an early Hydro car. You can check by
knocking the round cap at the front of the a arm out with a long rod from the
back of the a arm.  If they have splines, you will also need torsion bar
adjusters and bolts, as well as the torsion bar foam seals.

For awhile, Automotion had a kit to convert the struts to accept Koni
inserts.  Haven't seen them advertised for awhile, but worth a call.

The struts were never repairable as far as I know.  They are under gas
pressure on the inside.

If you can't convert the struts, buy 911SC struts and the ball joints and
ball joint pins to match.  The aluminum calipers will bolt up to the SC
struts, but not standard T struts of the era.  You can also look for S
struts, but they are harder to find and offer no advantage.

This conversion is VERY worthwhile.  The car will handle better, especially
if fitted with a front sway bar at the same time.  We did this to a friends T
many years back, and he could not believe the difference.
