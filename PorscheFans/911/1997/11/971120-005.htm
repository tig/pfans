Let me add my recommendation to the one from the Porschefans list about
PCA. You live in (I think) Golden Gate Region (around San Francisco) which
has a very active year-round program of social, technical and driving
events. You'll make new friends, and also find a lot of understanding
spouses (of both genders) to befriend yours and explain why it's okay that
you just HAVE to have this or that bit or piece to make the car go
faster-longer-lower-shinier......

PCA people also offer an incredible network of knowledge and resources to
keep your new little jewel running right and shining bright. Factory parts
prices? In New Yorkese, "fuhgedaboutit!" Between other members and the
sources available in "Porsche Panorama", the Club's national magazine
(calling it a "newsletter" doesn't begin to describe it any more), it's
like Alice's Restaurant..... "You can get anything you want....."

Aside from the social and parts/service source aspects, PCA regions tend to
sponsor one or more of six major car-oriented events: 

1) Concours d'elegance, which is French for "clean car contest",
competitive car cleaning, what a concept.

2) Road rallys, which are public-roads-based driving events which reward
winners for their ability to decipher clues, while driving at precise
(legal) speeds for precise distances and precise times.

3) Autocrosses, which are closed-course, (usually) low-speed events
involving driving through a course defined by traffic cones.

4) Drivers education events, conducted on racetracks, are designed to teach
you how to handle your car safely at high speeds. Experienced instructors
teach, you drive, everyone has a blast.

5) Technical meetings, where a room full of people hear expert presenters
talk about the arcane design and construction nuances that affect our
beautiful toys.

6) PCA Club Racing, an out-and-out racing series for people who just have
to see what they learned in Driver's ed.

If you can't find happiness and excitement in this, you may wish to ask
yourself why you love these little jellybean-shaped road rockets. 

Enough from me. Hit the website (www.pca.org) and join the fun!
