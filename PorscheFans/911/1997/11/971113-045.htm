Dave:

 You might try a couple of things regarding the oil temp problem. 

First- make absolutely sure that the guage and it's sending unit are
reading accurately.

Second- make sure that the rubber seals around the spark plug connectors
are in excellent shape. The hottest part of the engine is the cylinder
heads and these rubber seals help make sure that all of the cooling
airflow goes over them. This item is overlooked often.

Third- Remove the fan housing and make sure that there isn't anything
blocking the airflow over the cylinders or oil cooler. Heavy buildups of
dirt, oil, grease, etc can cause hot running engines.

Fourth- Make sure that the CO is within spec and that the ignition
timing isn't way retarded or advanced due to sticking advance weights
inside the distributor. Vacuum advance needs to work correctly as well.

Let me know what you find
