Greg:
I am changing a few things on my Targa during my restoration project and I
don't wish to compromise with the torsion bars. I have built 19mm swaybars
for this car that has not had swaybars before. The old rubber suspension
bushings are being replaced with after market polygraphite hyperformance
hyperbole ones. The rear rubber bushings were ignited while on the spring
plate and made an effective torch which reminded me of the movie where the
French citizens massed through the dark alleys of Paris during the
revolution holding their torches high. Anyway, along with new Konis this
suspension should achieve new levels of freedom and restraint. With all this
alteration the torsion bars spring rate will determine the natural frequency
(how fast the body bounces or oscillates in the absense of shock absorbers).
If the spring rate decreases because the torsion bars are worn out then the
suspension becomes very soft like my mother-in-law's Peugot that she
couldn't give away. That defeats my purpose. I have a feeling that at some
point semantics will fail and that suspension tuning will become the
visceral animal that it is.
