Colin,

	>I'm coming into this thread a little late . . .

Fair enough, and I'm very late in responding.

Pedal adjustment:  I'd try to avoid dropping the brake pedal very much
if the car is ever to be taken onto the track.  Under hard use, brakes
start going away, and more pedal travel is definitely the appropriate
path of truth and righteousness.  I've been happy fabricating a top &
side pedal extension; the Third Foot, as described, sounds similar
and should be worth doing.  I like to extend the pedal towards the
brake, so that heel-toe becomes ball-of-foot/outside-edge-of-foot, but
one must exercise caution that, when the brakes start to fade, you
don't end up catching part of the throttle when all you want or need
is the brakes.

Well, the ugly fact is, yes, it does make a difference.  Some background
is necessary here.  There are two reasons for blipping the throtte.  The
one most drivers relate to most easily is lining up the gears in the 
transmission so as to reduce the wear on the synchros.  This is the whole
basis of the double clutching since, if you don't let the clutch out when
the transmission is in neutral, you won't get things lined up no matter
how expertly you blip the throttle.

The second reason is that you want the engine spinning at the right
speed when you let the clutch out, so that, at the exact moment the
clutch is released, the motor is providing neither acceleration nor
deceleration.  If this is your only objective, you don't need to release
the clutch in the middle of the shift.

Many drivers simply count on the synchros to do their job and release the
clutch slowly while traveling in a straight line.  This will work, but it's
harder on the synchros, a little harder on the driveline and leads to a
certain
instability as the speed of the car is used to spin the motor up.  Such
instability becomes untenable when you start to put the car on the edge
of its capabilities during greater fractions of the lap.  In particular, if
the
brake bias is properly set, the additional work required of the rear tires
will tend to light them up.  If the car isn't proceeding in a very straight
line, the backend will start to come around (remember that, at this point,
there has been a lot of weight transfer to the front, but all the original
mass of the rear of the car is still at the rear).

Most drivers who work on heel-toe follow the single blip approach.  Other 
than the most expert of them, the usual result is that the synchros are
reasonably lined up, and the motor is spooled up pretty good at the
time the clutch is released.  And, again, if double-clutching is not the
issue, then a single blip can get the motor to the right speed for when
the clutch is released.

All this being said, if you are trying to save gears/synchros AND trying
to optimize stability as the clutch is released, there is a problem.  The
problem is that the blip just before releasing the clutch while in neutral,
if it is done just right, will dissipate somewhat by the time you get the
clutch in, the lower gear selected and the clutch back out.  Importantly,
the engine will rev down faster than the car is slowing down.  So,
if you're going to be truly precise, one blip will not do the job.  At this
point many people will give you a blank stare and presume that, heel
and toe having been tough enough to get good at, they are not going
to mess with any extra steps or harder methods.  However, if you're
looking for maximum car control, you don't want to be upsetting the
car any more than necessary.  The less you upset the car, the more
you can put it on its edge and still control its path.

What's a poor boy to do?

Bondurant's approach is one solution.  It requires learning how far down
to press the throttle to maintain, for a few seconds, what is something
like a high idle, while maintaining threshold braking.  It has the advantage
of relatively little foot movement, unlike the twisting required for the blip.
It's going to be hard to get good at.

The other approach was demonstrated in one of the videos that was
available 8 years ago, and is probably still available.  If I remember
correctly, it was the one featuring Parnelli Jones.  It's a bit of an
intricate dance on the pedals, but it also works.  If you're serious
about this approach, the video is worth seeing.  The first part of
the sequence is as you'd expect: brakes applied and continued, clutch, 
neutral, clutch out, blip, clutch in.  At this point, just after shifting into
the lower gear and at the last possible moment, just before you let out 
the clutch, you apply another blip, somewhat smaller than the first (since 
the engine is already pretty much spun up and you're only having to add 
back the rpms that were lost during the interval since the lower gear
was engaged), then let out the clutch.  The whole cadence is a bit
quick and synchopated, but learnable with enough practice.

This second approach is complex, and involves the foot/ankle twisting
again, but does not require precise control over how far down the 
throttle is pressed.  We're still doing ballistic actions.  I think this
approach is easier to learn than Bondurant's, but it's something about
which reasonable people might differ.

Hope this helps.
