I posted this to the 356 list last week and probably should have posted
to the 911 list, where I might get more response. Since then, I have at
least partially solved the problems as shown in blue, but still have one
that's got me stumped:

	At idle it varies around 1000 rpm and has an erratic "miss"
resulting in a drop of 200 rpm for a moment. This miss seems to occur
only after warm up. I changed ign. wires and plugs, but it's still a
problem.  Think it is a leaky carb. shaft on right carb.

	At off idle (2000-3000 rpm) it stumbles during acceleration
Changed left Solex with a spare one w/ tight shaft and flat carb base
which eliminated the stumble

	At highway speed (3800 rpm) power "seems" o.k. until you
accelerate, at which time it hesitates very noticeably.  Adjusted float
level higher which eliminated the hesitation. 

	Also, at this speed (3000+ rpm) a slow pulsing harmonic
vibration occurs which is definately from the engine, not the drive
train.  This will occur even when the car is stopped and engine is
running at 3000 rpm.  Haven't figured this one out yet.  It's related to
reciprocating weight I think. ( bent trans. input shaft?, imbalanced
flywheel?, crankshaft?)  I didn't have this until after a recent
engine-out project which included resurfacing the flywheel, new clutch,
new main and input shaft seals, and pilot bearing.  The bent input shaft
is doubtful since engine/trans were carefully removed/installed as unit.

	So what do you think the cause is?  Thanks in advance for your
response,  Greg.
