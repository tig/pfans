Snows starting to fly so I've reduced the price on this outstanding restored
and race prepped car. If she doesn't sell she goes in to hibernation for the
winter. Only 4000 miles since the restoration on all parts. In a detuned
state (smaller jets, timing retarded, higher elevation) she was chassis dyno
tested at 228 HP. A newer SC only tested at 150 HP at the same shop. With
bigger jets and all it should get about 25 to
50 more horses. This baby is as fast or faster than any newer stock 911
including the 3.3L Turbos. She's perfect for club racing or concour. I'm
listing all the improvements. It's long, I'm sorry but there's a lot of stuff
here.
