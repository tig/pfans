This finally makes some sense.  Wide tires are simply going to wear in
the middle.  Sounds reasonable.  I could understand the notion that
under-inflated tires would be soft and perhaps respond to centrifugal
(centripidal, rotating, whatever) force by ballooning out.  However, 
the phrase, 'increasing tire pressure counteracts this' left me a bit
puzzled.  Just what did we think the extra pressure was going to do,
suck the middle of the tire in towards the center of the rim?  Au
contraire, it, TOO, is going to push the center of the tire out.
Counteracted, no doubt, by appropriate casing design, it seems like
the pressure increase has to push on something.  Maybe if you could
build a hard right-angle into the shoulder and soft sidewalls, the 
increased pressure would bow the sidewalls out, pulling the center
in, but it sounds pretty iffy.

And then we have Ross Parker messing everything up by bringing
in empirical data, indicating that his wide tires do wear evenly.  In
the tone of Seinfeld, 'How DO they DO it?"
