I used RE71Rs in driver's ed for years, wet and dry. I really liked them
a lot...predictable, good grip, fair wear.  They weren't as fast as
Yokos in the dry, but were a LOT faster in the wet.  Unfortunately,
these days sizes are somewhat limited, although still have plenty of
selections for pre-SC cars.
