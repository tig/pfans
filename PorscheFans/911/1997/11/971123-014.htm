Hello all,
	Does it seem that Porsche is following the way of other manufactures =
and making the 911 look more and more like a Honda or an Acura or =
everything else being made today? Or is it just me? To me the shape has =
always been one of the big attractions and I don't know that I would buy =
a newer one now that it has changed so much. I read an article that said =
that 40% of the 911 parts are now interchangable with the Boxster. =
Something doesn't seem right. Of course, the engineering will always be =
admired and that alone is worth the price. Opinions and flames welcome: =
