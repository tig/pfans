Michael:

>I'm running into a problem during the restoration of my 1969 911T:


Are you at the point of reconnecting your wiring harness?

>The engine fuse box contains two fuses.  The innnermost fuse is connected
to the coil and to the fuel pump.  When the ingition is turned to the on
position, this fuse is not energized.  There is a blue lead with a yellow
tracer that heads back to the front of the car.

The blue lead with a yellow tracer appears to go to the RPM transducer. The
coil and fuel pump as well as the fuse lead breakout of a WECO connector.
This connector is fed by a red wire that originates from the left side of
fuse 6 in fuse box 1 in the luggage compartment. Check there for power at
the appropiate times. If there is power there and not at the coil, then the
terminal connector in the front of the engine compartment may not be making
contact. If fuse 6 is not getting power then the terminal connector into the
dash may not be making contact or the ignition switch is faulty. This is
assuming that all wiring in between is intact.

Unfortunately, as you may know, the wiring diagram in the Haynes Manual for
the '69 is only for the E and S. Most of the diagram seems to be applicable
to the T but does not show the fuel pump or coil connections correctly.
Please contact me if I can be of further assistance.
