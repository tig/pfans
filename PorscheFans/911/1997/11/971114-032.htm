Hi fellow Porsche pilots,

Here is a recent story about my '83 911SC Targa.

About 3 weeks ago my car started running kinda of rough, it about =
coincided with the first "cool" weather here in Florida so I suspected =
that fuel pressure regulator was acting up. I decided I should =
disassemble it and clean it (I had done it before with success), I also =
decided it was probably about time for a new fuel filter ( I drive about =
450 miles a week so I run a lot of gas through the filter).  After I was =
finished the car did run a little better, but I was still experiencing =
rough idle and a curious loss of power at about 4500 rpm.  Anyway I came =
to the conclusion that I better start looking for a replacement fuel =
regulator and continued to drive the car.  1 Week ago I started to =
notice jumping of the tach needle at idle by almost 1000 rpm, Since the =
car didn't actually sound like it was stepping that much in rpm I decide =
to look into the ignition system, I inspected the plugs, wires, cap and =
rotor, everything looked OK (I was worried that the CD iginiton might be =
flaking out so I took it apart and measured a solid 400 VDC on the =
capacitor - it also had a nice loud whistle).

On Tuesday I got in the car to head for work and it ran really bad when =
I started it up (really bad !!) I debated about not taking it and =
driving the wifes car but I was running late and decide that it was =
probably just cold.  After about a mile it started to run better and I =
hopped onto I-95 for my 45 min drive to work.  After about 30 miles on =
I-95 the engine stopped completely and gave me one TREMENDOUS backfire, =
complete with a blue flame I could see in the driver side mirror.  I =
coasted to a stop and called AAA to get a tow back home.  After a nice =
half hour chat with the tow truck driver I arrived home and began =
troubleshooting. =20

I was convinced that I would find something obvious and that it would be =
the ignition system.  I first checked for a spark from the HT lead of =
the cool - no spark was found.

I checked the coil itself by disconnecting it and using a clip lead to =
fire it - I did get a small spark so I decided the coil must be good.  =
(To this point my troubleshooting was flawless but I was about to make a =
mistake).

I decided that the problem must lie with the CD unit and removed it and =
disassembled it and much to my glee I found a bad solder joint right at =
the connector.  I resoldered it and put it back in the car.  But I still =
didn't get a spark.  At this point I decided that I was an idiot for =
taking apart the CD unit and that I had probably damaged it.  BUT I had =
another one on the shelf ( It was sure it was a bad unit but I figured =
that with two of them I might be able to find the bad component in the =
one I had just removed).  I spent about two hours fooling around with CD =
units until I had convinced myself that the original one was still =
functional and that maybe it wasn't getting triggered by the =
distributor.

I pulled the cap off and what was left of the rotor, timing plate and =
assorted other goodies spilled into the engine compartment.  The top =
bearing on the distributor had failed allowing the distributor shaft to =
wobble around inside the cap and thus destroy itself.  Well now I am =
waiting for my re-built distributor I hope I get it by Tuesday of next =
week and I expect a spectacular improvement in performance.

I am not really upset about it after all a distributor that can last for =
256K miles is pretty impressive, I hope the re-built one lasts that =
long.  Of course after looking at the manuals my car was experiencing =
classic distributor problems,  I have so few problems with the car that =
I sometimes forget that I have factory manuals though.

Anyway thought you might be entertained by may tale.

AAA sure beats a piece of clothesline and an old roommate.
