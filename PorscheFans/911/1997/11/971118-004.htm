'Scuse me while I pull Murphy's knife from my back.  It seems I spoke too
soon.  After running fine all day Monday, I got rumblin, stumblin, bumblin
on the way home.  She's running on five cylinders now and my immediate
suspicion is the spark plugs of unknown vintage.  I figure I'll replace
them all tonight as a matter of course and check the wires and distributor
as well.  A couple of questions before I get started.
1. Any advice on checking the dist.?  I don't have much experience with
them and am wondering what I should be looking for -- wear, corrosion,
little blackened bits, that sort of thing.  I also don't want to misalign
the rotor...er...if that's possible.
2. If it's a spark plug that suicided, what about fragments in the
cylinder?
3. Anyone know the proper torque for a spark plug?

My guess is that the plugs had quite a few miles on them and the hard
driving this weekend just about put them over the edge, so that all it took
was a little driving on Monday to kill them.  I'll know more after tonight.

One other thing (when it rains, it pours), my brand-new Pagid orange pads
are now causing horrific scraping noises on the rear brakes.  They worked
beautifully at the driver's ed, but started this scraping sound on the way
home.  I did my best to bed them in properly *prior* to the driver's ed,
but due to cold weather and rain I may not have succeeded.  I don't think I
warped a rotor because I don't get any vibration.  Any clues before I check
'em?

Sorry for the long post.  Please reply directly to me (and to the list), as
I'm on digest and I want to get this going tonight.

TIA
Mark
