At the risk of being flamed, I've got a great idea...if you don't like the
way the 996 looks, don't buy one.  I'll bet that will really show Porsche.
Boy will they ever be sorry they screwed with the 911, won't they?  Give me
a break.  Come on, how many of you had the same reaction when the 993 came
out (best looking Porsche 911 ever IMHO)?

I congratulate Porsche for having the guts to change the car to meet the
needs of the real world out there which unfortunately includes very strict
emission laws and WAY too many lawyers (usually found driving Porsches or
BMWs).  Look at it this way...we're lucky to be able to drive these
wonderful automobiles, and Porsche is lucky to still be an independent car
manufacturer, and if the 996 keeps them alive at the modest cost of bugging
a few dyed in the wool air-cooled Porschephiles, so be it.  Personally, I
don't think it's as nice looking as the 993 and so I decided to buy a 1997
911 C2.  I've always wanted a Porsche, and wasn't sure I liked the 996,
so....but I still think Porsche did the only thing they could do to
survive.  I'd say let's all hold back on our criticism until we actually
have a chance to see one and, more importantly, drive one.  Then at least
the criticism will be based on our own experiences, not pictures and
articles out of car magazines.

Anyone want to buy my 1991 BMW 750iL?  Nice V-12 WATER-cooled engine UP
FRONT!  $22K and it's yours...seriously.

OK, I'm done, stepping off the soapbox, and donning my flame-proof suit.

Now, on a more serious note, I'm getting some steering wheel vibration at
approx 55-65 MPH.  Nothing below or above (BIG GRIN!) that. I figure it's
wheel balance.  Any thoughts?  The alignment checks out OK (according to
the dealer), so I can only assume one or more wheels are no longer in balance.

Also, I've been watching the thread on manuals with some interest.  When I
bought the BMW two years ago, I bought the shop manual ($100) via an
Internet source along with the parts and specs fiche ($20-25 each).  I have
done most of the minor maintenance myself and would like to be able to do
the same with the 911, but $500 for a shop manual seems a bit steep.  On
the other hand, I know nothing at all about maintaining these wonderful
beasts, and so am looking for any information that would help.  Any ideas?

Thanks,
