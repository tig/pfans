Scott,

It sounds like you have a loose hose that goes from the fuel tank to the
charcoal canister.  That canister is located inside the front boot on the
drivers side just under the fuses and behind the head lamp.  The canester is
pressurized by a hose that goes from the engine shroud (where it is
pressurized by fan pressure) to the canester and is designed to blow gas
fumes back into the tank rather than having them vent to the atmosphere.  If
the line comes loose you get all those gas fumes blown into the boot and
from there into the passenger compartment or out by the front tire.

<Subject: Gas Fumes in '73 T

<I have looked everywhere!  It is definitely coming from the front of the 
<car.  When the car is parked overnight the fumes seem to be the worse 
<inside the car.  After "spirited" driving you can also smell it.  I can not

<find any leaks.  On the track I am getting gas coming out of the overflow 
<tube up in the left front wheel well.  I am not sure if that has anything 
<to do with the problem or not.  Any ideas?  

<Thanks,

<Scott
