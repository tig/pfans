"73.5 911 (with CIS), just driving along at low revs or high, the engine stops dead for a few milliseconds, then continues.  It's as if someone switched the key off then back on. . . also, there is an occasional backfire." 

James, my l975 911 S Targa was doing exactly the same thing!  I asked my
mechanic about it, and he recommended a new Permatune CD box.  That seemed to help for a short while (100 miles or so), and then the problem came back.  Turned out the main problem was contaminated points.  New points seems to have solved the problem.  One P-fan who replied to my request for assistance at the time suggested that I try cleaning the contact surfaces of the points with a matchbook cover -- it's worth a try!
