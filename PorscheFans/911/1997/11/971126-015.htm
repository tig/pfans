Greetings Porsche fans.  I just purchased my first Porsche, a silver 1971
911T. Truth be told, I always wanted a newer SC, but the more I read about
the 911, the more I began to want a lighter, closer to the original
concept, Porsche.  The kicker in my decision to go with the earlier car was
when California passed the law to exempt all 1973 and earlier cars from
smog tests.  

I'm sure I will have many questions as I sort out this car.  The first of
which pertains to oil capacity.  My car has a makeshift dipstick (I've got
a new one on order from Porsche now) so when I changed the oil I didn't
know exactly how much to put in.  The owner's manual said 7.4 U.S. quarts.
The sticker on the car says 7 liters.  The Clymer repair manual says 9.4
U.S. quarts.  I drained approximately 10 quarts from the car.  I then put
7.4 quarts in the car.  My oil gage reads 5 liters/quarts (?).  My car may
have an aftermarket oil cooler on it, but I'm not sure.  The car has
factory A/C and I believe that the AC is the cooler under the deck lid, but
the car also has what looks like an oil cooler at the very front of the car
under the front valence.  Or maybe I have the oil cooler and the AC cooler
mixed up.  

Anyway, if anyone can tell me 

1)  If my car has an aftermarket or additional oil cooler on it and
2)  How much oil I should put in it I would be very appreciative.

Thanks,

John

1971 911T
