Lee:

What size is the line to-and-from the cooler?  How large is the B&B cooler?
I'm installing an RX7 cooler which measures about 5"x23" and is much
longer than the other cars I've seen at the track.  I bought 12AN SS line
and am still seeking feedback before I decide to run my Terbatrol in
series or not.  At Pocono last week, I saw an '87 Carrera racecar with only a
small front cooler and 12AN lines which always runs cool in the NorthEast.
p.s. what do you mean by taping it to get it to 210-220?  Are you blocking
air-flow on purpose because it runs too cool?  The thermostat should take
care of that.

Thanks,
