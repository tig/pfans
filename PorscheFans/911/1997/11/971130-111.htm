Hi Pfans,

I just bought a beautiful 80 911SC Targa and have a few questions. Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.

1. Why does my 911 have a factory Fog light switch when I dont have fog 
lights? (I would assume they would have just left a blank there) Is it 
possible this controls something else? 

2. The car leans to the drivers side a bit. Is there an adjustmet that can be 
made to correct this? My 944 leans in the opposite direction but I have to 
replace the springs to fix it. (Hope this isnt the case with my 911.)

3. How do you work those damn defrosters between the seats anyway?

4. Can anyone recomend a good solution to the stock shifter? Im anxious to 
take on the corvette down the street. He wont try me in my 944 anymore and 
Im relunctant to race him in my 911 until I get a decent shift kit.

5. Id like to put a tail on, either Whale or Carrera. Prefer a Whale but have 
been told
it is much wider than a carrera tail and it might not look right on an SC 
Targa, but I have nothing to compare them to. Any thoughts? 

Thanks in advance.
