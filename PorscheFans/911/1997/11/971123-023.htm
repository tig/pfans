Folks,
I have an 1986 911 Carrera with the 915 Transmission.
The clutch, pressure plate, through-out bearing, and pilot were replaced 
about 1.5 years ago (recently?).  The pressure plate was refinished.
Now, after 8000 miles or so, when I lift the clutch pedal, at the very top 
of the "stroke," the clutch pedal tends to stay hung down about 1 inch.  If 
I accelerate, the clutch rises through this "dead" zone but if I very 
carefully, very carefully, and slowly accelerate, the clutch stays down the 
1 inch or so.  This does not seen to affect the shifting and no slip of the 
clutch seems apparent.
Do I need to adjust the clutch, rebuild the pedal bearings, or what?
Is it correct for the pedal to reach the top of it's stroke with a little 
free play indicating(?) that the through-out bearing is totally unloaded? 
 Is it possible to "negatively" load the through-out bearing?
Thanks
Tony Scribner
