<snip>

As you indicate, it may be only be a problem 'in the heat of battle', but
that grinding noise is usually  the sound of catching reverse in the 5-4
shift. I never had the problem on the street, but found it happening on the
track. Automotion sells a spring kit that is supposed to prevent this
problem in 915s, but I was unable to install it in a '72 shift tower.
Instead, I bought an SC shift tower and it was a 95% solution. I suspect
the rest of the solution is stiffer engine mounts...

I had that trouble with a G 50, and ended up having the transmission taken
apart to solve it.  Some monkey had put an incorrect retaining pin in the
transmission. (The correct one was found at the bottom of the trans case.)
You are wise not to force it. the leverage of the shift linkage is
enormous, and can accelerate transmission damage if you get too heavy
handed. I know this from e$perien$e.
