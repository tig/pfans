Ok, I admit I'm not the world's greatest mechanic.  After several hours of
trying I still haven't managed to change the spark plugs.  I hear you
falling over with laughter.  Prepare for stupid questions....

What's the accepted manner to get at the plugs?  I figured top access was
hopeless so I attacked it from underneath.  There's a cover plate/splash
guard that I need to remove to get at the plugs.  Unfortunately, I could
remove all but two screws on each side -- those seem to be welded on -- and
never got the plates off.

Even when I do get to the plugs, I'm not sure I can get my torque wrench in
there.  How do you guys manage it?

Top access on the passenger side would be much easier with the a/c
compressor removed.  I can unbolt it and move it around, but the two lines
connected to it prevent it from moving very far.  Can I disconnect those
lines without screwing up my a/c (which works very well, finally)?

Those plug recesses are *deep*.  I had to use an extension on my socket
when I did a test fit, then had a bitch of a time getting the socket back
out because the extension kept coming off.  Had to use a pair of pliers,
blind.  Should I remove the "Porsche" covers, and if so what can of worms
does that open?

At 50 bucks an hour, I'd be getting rich on this job.  ;)  Anybody want me
to work on their car???
