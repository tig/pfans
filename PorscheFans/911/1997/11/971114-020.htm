Hello all...
I've been lurking on this list for a couple of months now...and I'm jumping
into the fray.

Anyway...I'm currently contemplating the purchase of a 1978 911SC Targa.
(I took it for a test drive... the grin factor is unbeatable).

I've been doing my homework (purchased the Haynes 911 manual, read Bruce 
Anderson's "buying a porsche 911", read the porsche faq, and ordered a few
more books (Bruce Andersons' and someone elses) from amazon). I'm now at
the point where I have tons of questions, and no-one to ask them of!

The car I'm looking at is as follows:
1978 911 SC Targa - with 75K miles (although I think this is low) (built 77/11)
It has an oil cooler (is this std?), (11 blade fan...is this std for this year?)
It had engine work done 5 years ago (at 50K miles). Mostly ring work from
what I can tell from the receipt.
It doesn't seem to have carrera tensioners (is there a way to tell this 
short of removing the chain covers...or finding a receipt for them?)

The major concern I have right now is the transmission. The current owner
was having problems shifting into first (had to be at a dead stop), so
he took it in to have this worked on (feb of this year). By october, something
in the transmission had "moved or something" such that the transmission could
no longer be put into 1st gear at all! (oh oh). Now its in the shop again
(a different shop), having the repair, repaired. Needless to say, this
worries me (greatly!). How can I ensure that this repair work will be done
well...? (can anyone recommend good shops in the Toronto area, or identify
shops to avoid?). If worst comes to worst, would the safest bet be to
put in a rebuilt transmission? (or send the current one to a reputable 
rebuilder?) (I don't want this car to be a money pit! ;-)

At somepoint I'll have to take it to be safety checked and totally checked out.
Once again, any recommendations as to where in Toronto to go, would be 
greatly appreciated. 

Are there any other major areas with this car to be concerned about?

If there's a knowledgeable owner of a porsche who'd like to help me through 
this process, and who can answer my questions I'd be really grateful 
(I'd be more than willing to summarize my questions and your answers, 
and send this summary back to the list!)

Thanks
