I found my alarm problem (see 10/10/97 list).  I thought I'd share the 
solution.

Short version:

I figured out where the small spring makes contact with the side of the 
radio and placed a small square of electrical tape there.

Long Version:

On the top of the factory CD player there is a switch covered by a 
piece of spring metal.  When this switch is depressed it connects one 
of the leads on the main radio connector to ground.  In addition the 
factory has provided a small spring metal switch on the side of the 
radio chassis opening.  Both of these switches are wired to the same 
input on the Central Locking/Alarm Unit.  If either of these get 
shorted to ground then the alarm goes off.

The switch on top is normally open when the radio is installed fully 
into the dash but gets depressed when the unit is slid out of the 
chassis.  Presumably the switch on the side is intended to contact the 
chassis and thereby ground it when the radio gets wiggled to remove it 
from the chassis.

In my case the switch on the side was contacting the radio at all 
times.  I simply figured out where it touched the radio and placed a 
small square of electrical tape there.  If you wiggle the radio out it 
will still set off the alarm.

I am assuming that the reason Porsche has two anti-theft switches is to 
accomdate aftermarket radios.  They also may have  figured that a thief 
with very small hands could remove the rear connector before removing 
the radio thereby disabling the switch on top of the radio.  It that 
case the side switch would get 'em.  I still haven't figured out how 
they got through the doors...
