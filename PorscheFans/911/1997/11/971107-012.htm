I was about to ask the same thing. My car's gas mileage has dropped about 2 mpg. Also in the DC area. What's going on?

Does anyone know if the gas suppliers just changed their formula for the
winter (i.e., to highly oxygenated fuels)?  

My p-car just started running poorly (surging badly and idling roughly).  I
just took my wife's car in for service because it is running poorly
(surging, low power, rough idle).  I just drove the rental car to work
(surging, low power, rough idle).  Does anyone else see a trend here?

Before I tear into my car, I'm curious if the car has the flu or is just
eating bad gas?  All of the gas has been purchased in Northern Virginia and
Washington DC.
