Phil, you can calculate a fairly close estimate of your tire's
circumference.
Remember that tire sizes use the format of:
     (Tread width)/(Aspect ratio)R(Wheel diameter)
Using the 185/65R15 as an example:
     Tread width is 185mm
     Aspect ratio (ratio of sidewall width to tread width) is 65%
     Wheel diameter is 15 inches

Again, using 185/65R15 as an example:
     Sidewall width = (Tread width) X (Aspect ratio)
     Sidewall width = (185mm) X (65%) = 120mm

     Diameter of tire = 2 X (Sidewall width) + Wheel diameter
     Diameter of tire = 2 X (120mm) + (15 inches) X (25.4 mm/inch)
     Diameter of tire = 240mm + 381mm = 621mm

     Circumference = 3.14 X (Diameter of tire) = 3.14 X 621mm = 1,950mm

If your speedometer is reading 7% low, then you can "correct" this by
putting 
on tires that have a 7% smaller circumference.  The closest "165" tread
width 
tire to correct this error (circumference = 93% X 1,950 mm = 1,814mm)
would be 
a 165/60-R15 with a circumference of 1,819mm.  The closest "185" tread
width 
tire to correct this error would be a 185/55-R15 with a circumference of
1,836mm
(which would still leave a -1% error).  

So, the 195/65R15's you mentioned would have a circumference of 1,993mm 
and your speedometer error would worsen to about 10%.  My 1971 911S
rubbed
slightly with 195/65-15's and with 205/60-15's, but only during extreme
"parking lot"
turns (which I now avoid).

FYI: Don't make the same mistake I made and assume the speedometer error
is the same as the odometer error; they are much different in my car.
You 
can check the odometer error by measuring against the mile markers along
the 
highway.  You can check the speedometer error by using a stopwatch (you 
should have 60 seconds between mile markers at 60 mph).

Since tire sizes affect all sorts of things on your car (e.g.
acceleration,
top speed, handling, speedometer, and odometer), it may not be wise to
focus 
your tire search on speedometer accuracy.  I would not want to trade off
handling for speedometer accuracy.  For general use, it seems reasonable
to me to either:
     1) put on the original size tires, or
     2) put on the widest tire you can fit, using the aspect ratio for a
tire which is the 
          closest to the original tire size's circumference.
and then mentally adjust for whatever speed/odometer error exists.
Frankly, your
best advise will likely come from the experienced members in your local
club 
who drive their cars in a manner similar to you.  I use 205/55-15 for
street tires (on 
6 inch Fuchs) and 225/50-15 for autocrosses and time trials ( 6 and 7
inch Fuchs).
NOTE: My car is lowered slightly but my suspension has been somewhat
tightened.

By the way, I put an Excel spreadsheet together which calculates tire
diameters and 
circumferences for a wide variety of tire sizes.  Let me know if you
want a copy.
