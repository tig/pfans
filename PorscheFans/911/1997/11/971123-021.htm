Subject: Reason for Chain Tensioner Upgrade

The Carrera tensioners are the recommended solution to this problem.
Mechanical stops are a low cost solution but only if you hear impending chain
slap noises from the failed tensioner. Better be close to home too. Avoid
mechanical tensioners because there is no way for the system to compensate
for chain stretch/slack due to temperature and wear variations. Unless you're
in there often enough to adjust it. If set too tight then chain wear
accelerates. If too loose.... Well you've got the idea if the chain is too
loose.

I put in the hydraulic tensioners and .... Lo and behold I still had chain
slap!! (Left side only). Evidently, my engine modifications (cylinder head
surfacing, deck height machining, etc.) placed my chain just outside the
tensioning range of the hydraulic tensioner. Mechanics tell me the regular
tensioners have a little more range. 

The solution? An oversize chain wheel on the idler arm. Buried in Bruce
Anderson's new edition Performance book was a small paragraph (along with a
photo elsewhere in the book) about over/under size chain wheels for those
annointed with such engines in need. The oversize wheel (created in several
sizes) allows the idler arm to get into the range where the tensioner can
control the chain slack. I went ahead and replace both sides along with
updated (post '80) idler arms. Now the engine is smooth and quiet (though not
that kind of quiet).

There are other solutions as well. Let me know if anybody is interested.
