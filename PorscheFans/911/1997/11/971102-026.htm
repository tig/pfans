Subject: Oil cooler questions

Hi - I have a 1970 911 coupe with a 2.7 engine, Webers, headers,
and 915 transmission.  The engine was built to one of the formulas
in Bruce Anderson's book (Euro RS pistons, E cams) and is rated
at 210 HP.  The oil cooler setup includes the stock cooler on
the engine, plus a thermostat, oil lines and trombone front cooler
from a later car.  The oil lines from the thermostat to the trombone
are the original type metal lines.  The lines from the engine to
the thermostat don't look OEM.
   The oil temp runs about 180 on the street and I did see 250
when I had the car at the track on a hot (90 degree) day.  The car
is basically a track car and driven very little on the street.

Larry, I have a 2.7 liter engine (RS Spec) also.  I went through all the 
permutations I cared to on oil coolers for track usage, and what finally 
worked was a B&B front mounted cooler, with  the RS bumper with an open 
grill in front of it and as much open flowing space behind it as you can 
get.  A fender mounted cooler was an improvement over stock, but not 
enough of an improvement, so I would discourage spending money on a 
fender mounted cooler (unless you want to buy mine :).  Finally oil 
cooling is a non-issue. Even on the hottest Texas days, the car hardly 
gets over 210, and I find I have to tape it to get it to 210-220 on most 
other days.  

Good luck.
