I've looked at the old seal, the Targa glass, and the defroster wires, and I
am convinced that the glass was in the outer channel and the wires were in
the inner channel.  Also, my wires are routed a little differently, the
ground wire runs in the sheath that goes into the engine compartment as well.

My question is: doesn't it make sense to have the defoster wires on the
inside of the glass rather than the outside?  It seams to me that running
the wires from the inside of the glass where they attach to the clips, under
the bottom edge of the glass to the outside of the glass for routing just
doesn't make any sense.
  I have looked at all the holes in the old seal and they are between the
outer seal and the inner seal and the clip marks left in the old seal are in
the outer channel.  Okay, so the old seal was installed wrong?  I'm pretty
sure that it is the original seal, however,  as I have owned the car since
'83 and I have all the records from '72.

Still confused on Targa glass installation,
Mark
