Ahhhh, but I *did* say that I hadn't had the car for long, didn't I!!!

Perhaps the PO took a file and shaved down the inside and outside edges,
or perhaps he does his own alignment every 2 months and switches back
and forth from lots of negative camber to lots of positive camber! ;^)

(i.e. I wouldn't call my data terribly empical!!!)
