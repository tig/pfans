Greetings P-nuts,
I posted this ad here on the 911 group once before, on 10/23/97 (I think)
and since then my hard-drive took a rather nice dump -- So, as a
consequence I have no idea if anyone has tried to get back to me on this.
If anyone has tried to email me, please do so again - thanks loads

At any rate...

I have this nice, very original Targa on my hands that I'd like to place in a
good home.  It belongs to a good friend of mine, who has left it up to me
to find a good home for it...It's a good car.  Any questions etc can be
directed right back to me - no problem...I have the car in my posession
now, so please call @ any numbers listed below. Thanks.

cheers
Thom Kuby
