Going "too fast for the turn" means, I suppose, that the car is going to
understeer off the road, or oversteer and spin out, or you feel it will.
Fair enough.  You actually have a lot of options with the 911 in that 
situation - more than many other cars.
Going too fast and understeering - Very carefully use a small lift off the
throttle to induce rotation (oversteer) which slows you down by scrubbing
off speed and cancels the understeer.  Obviously you have to practice this
at lower speeds to get comfortable with it.
Going too fast and oversteering - Correct oversteer by a quick steering
wheel correction and return.  Then use a "sawing" motion with the steering
wheel to balance the oversteer (steering with the rear of the car and
just using the steering wheel to correct your line) while maintaining an
even throttle.  You can also practice this at the track by intentionally
early apexing and using the natural oversteer of the car to complete
the turn (Hurley Haywood technique).
 
Hope this helps.
