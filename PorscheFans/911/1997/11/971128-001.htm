Re the question about the pop-off valve:  I don't recall anyone
responding as to how to get one, so here goes.  It's not a factory item,
so a Porsche dealer wouldn't be expected to carry it.  Most of the
aftermarket houses have it, however; it should cost you $39 or so.  You
need a hole saw to install it, plus some epoxy (J-B Weld or similar).

There was also a question about a parts source.  For factory items, I've
had good luck with Stoddard [(800) 342-1414]--they have almost
everything in stock, and don't have artificial s&h charges--you pay
their actual cost (postage plus a little more for packaging) and no
sales tax.  So you can order a decal or trim clip and not have to pay an
automatic $5.95 (or whatever it is that Automotion charges these days,
minimum).
