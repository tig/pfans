Howdy Pholks,

First let me give you my $ 0.02 on the fiberglass body parts. It's not so
much the fiberglass itself you have to worry about. After about 20 years
most people know how to make a decent body-panel out of fiberglass that
doesn't shrivel/wrinkle or what ever (unlike us people). Therefore painting
them will be no problem what so ever (takes so extra preps though). What
does cause trouble is the place where the parts are fitted. The
panels/parts that come as a complete unit shouldn't give you any problems
at all (front fenders, bumbers, skirts, decklids etc.) since these replace
the org.parts completely. The main problem are the rear fenders, which will
have to be 'glued' onto the existing parts. It's these 'welds' that are the
trouble makers because you have to different materials (being sheetmetal
from the org.bodywork and the fiberglass) which have different
stressfactors. The stress always appears at the 'weld'. Ofcourse on newly
applied f.g. bodyparts this is invisible so you won't see the weld on any
demo-car (unless they did a real scrappy job that is) but on the long turn
they will show, no matter how good the job was done. 
I rebuild my previous car, a VW Scirocco with a f.g.body kit (which made it
fit 285 rear tires - go figure) my self. It took me nine months (well every
Saturday out of those) which included several in between paintjobs, and I
just know for sure I did a better job than any bodyshop could have done for
me but after about 9 months I could see the welds (hardly anybody else
could, but I saw them anyway). They didn't crack the paint, but the
f.g.parts had just set in (shrunk just a teeny wheeny little bit) which
showed through the paint. Once it was settled it didn't get any worse
though (I drove it for 6 more years without further problems), but it still
bothered me anyway.
If you want something that really looks good instead of flash, I would say
go for the metal kits available!
Good luck.
