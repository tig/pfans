This is my first post so please bear with me if I do it wrong.  I have a 75
911S 2.7 that I owned for 10 years, sold to my Nephew who owned for another
10 years, then I bought it back.  It is (or was) running great.  I use it as
a weekend driver only and had not started it for several weeks.  This
morning, on start, I got the dreaded backfire.  Now it won't start.  I think
I had this happen once on my first ownership period and it turned out that
the box was not blown.  Anything I can check before taking it in?  My Haynes
manuel is no help. The car has just over 60,000 miles, manual chain
tensioner, headers, upgraded valve covers, valve job at 50,000, and a few
other fixes.  Thanks in advance.
