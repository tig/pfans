Screeeeeeeeech Aaaaaaaaaaaaa Karawhrumpppp ..... silence. The quiet drip of 
gasoline.... KABOOOM!!!.    .......Well, you had to ask. ;-)

Steer like hell, Ross, and hope you have said enough prayers? I dunno Ross, I 
have had my 911 for a while, experience begets knowledge, maybe.... and 
overconfidence, probably. Of course, having now said that, next you will here 
that I have James Deaned it into a tree. Take it easy, push your own limits 
gingerly, and you will get the feel of it. A little tail twitching is fun, a 
spin is not.... May I suggest Driver's Ed? I know I could profit from some 
good instruction...   Good Luck,  W.

What happens if while driving your 911 around a fast turn you realize that
you are going to fast for the turn?  If you brake you are screwed.  If you
let up on the gas you are screwed.  If you don't do a thing you are screwed.
I know that you are "suppose" to brake before the turn and accelerate into
and during the turn in an "ideal" situation, but things do not always work
that way.
