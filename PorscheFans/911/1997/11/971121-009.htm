Just did the spark plug change on my 89 Carrera.  I indeed had the problem 
of separating the extension from the socket after tightening.  One method I 
use is to apply a small amount of silicone grease to the socket's rubber 
insert.  Releases from the plug easily, can't hurt the conductive path and 
won't excite your ire when you need to pull the wire boot for the next 
change.

As Mark has observed, changing the plugs on a 911 can be a bit of a
challenge, particularly on the AC side.
The spark plug socket invariably gets stuck on the plug because the
friction of the rubber plug 'grabber' inside the socket is greater than the
resistance of the little button that holds the socket and the extension
together.  When you attempt to pull the socket and extension out of the
hole, the extension separates from the socket instead of the socket from
the plug.  Now you have the socket buried inside the plug hole & some
ingenuity & pesistence is usually required to fish it out.
Obviously the objective is to prevent the socket and extension from
separating.  The answer:  wrap the joint with some masking tape, or
maybe even some of that roll of duct tape you have laying around the
garage.  I personally prefer masking tape, because duct tape leaves a
sticky residue on the tools.
Happy fishing,
