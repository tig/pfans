First off, yes, to get the spring plate off of the torsion bar, you will
have to remove the eccentric bolts.  The good (?) news is that changing
your ride height affects the suspension geometry (alignment) so
you'd have to mess with these again anyway.

Did the aforementioned joker "corner balance" the car?  If so, then
maybe for some reason, the left rear *has* to be a little low for it
to balance out?  Anyway, if you raise only the left rear, most likely
you're going to mess up, or at best alter, the corner balance of the
car.  Since ride height, alignment and corner balance are all
inter-related, changing the ride height at one corner of the car
is going to mess everything up.

My suggestion would be to start from scratch.  Get a copy of Ray
Scrugg's booklet on how to align your 911, set your ride heights
where *you* want them, align the car to whatever specs *you*
want and then corner balance the car (easy to do if you can
borrow a set of scales from someone).

Good luck,
