Folks,
I drove my 78 911SC back from Kansas City to IL this Sunday. I have a
permanent smile on my face these days, and had one throughout the 5.5
hour of 'safe' driving (max 95 mph). I have more questions about my 911,
hopefully you guys will help me out on this. Once again all help is much
appreciated (I am glad I did not buy an auto 928).

Q1) What is the regular idle on a 78 911 SC (3.0)? My motor starts at
2000 rpm and then drops to just above 1000rpm. The reason I am asking
this is because I am having a hell of a time driving the 'beast' in
town. I mean the car starts heaving (hiccups) when I have it in 2nd gear
at 2000-2100 rpm. Is that normal? It loves high rpm, but on roads with
30mph limits, I would love to atleast put it in 3rd gear. Any thoughts?
Am I being an oxymoron, or is there something the matter with my car?

Q2) What is the best REPAIR manual for a 911. Is Hayes good enough? For
Audi's Bentley makes the best manuals, is there something like that I
can buy. For driving I have a choice between Bruce Anderson or Vic
Elford. Any thoughts?

Q3) Is there a source I can use to get rid of the striped paint under
the windows and railings on my BLACK Porsche. The white surface right
under the sills seems a common problem and I am sure there is a solution
for it.

Thanks folks, until next time.
