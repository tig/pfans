Mark had some problems changing spark plugs in his 911.
There has been a lot of replies, but nobody mentioned the superb
spark plug tool made by/for Porsche. =


Hi Mark,

Get the original spark plug tool that come with the car, or
at least came with my -85. =

It has a spring and swivel somewhat. Rubber boot inside that =

hold the plug. You need also an allen wrench, 10mm,  to turn this. =

It has nice knurled end, so it's easy to turn by hand when the =

plug is loose. =


I have a myriad of different spark plug tools, first tried everything
and wondered, this can't be so cumbersome. Took the original tool
and found out that it's a Porsche among spark plug tools. =

It has a bit of "fisherman=92s wife" look, it's just practical, nothing e=
lse.
Just remember the torque for spark plugs in Al-heads is very low, =

and regardless of other opinions, also Porsche's, I use always =

sensor safe hi-temp anti-seize paste on spark plug threads. =
