 I saw your post about the 959 conversion. I was wondering where the other
$7500 came from? I can under stand $4500 for body parts, ~ $2000 for tires
and wheels, the rest?

Thanks for any input,

Todd, wheels and tires are above and beyond the 12k, 7.5 covers
me taking apart a 911, installing a glass one piece nose that raises
the hood 1.5 inches at the latch to gain a more bulbous nose.  One 
then needs to fit a one piece rear that includes both 1/4s, a rear tray
area as wide as turbo flares between tailights below wing, rear valance
and rear door jamb panels. The door jamb panels are fact. metal parts
incorporated into the glass part during layup. This leading edge is 
welded into the inner 1/4-wheelhse panel as a factory part would be.
This method works, as opposed to bonding a "skin" to the door edge
and slamming the door a few hundred times and flexing the body in and 
out of "Burger Doodle" will certainly lead to delamination. Coupe or cab
will then get a short bond areafrom  quarter window area to engine bay
opening. A wrap of glass seals the lenthwise edge of engine bay. Rear
support bkts are built for rear of glass at tlight area. Fitting of the 959
tunnel wing also occurs before any welding or glass work. After that
both left and right rockers get a panel that connects the body flare
flow from both wheels These require mods to the existing rocker as to 
maintain an "even" door gap. After the body is fit a truing of parts to 
secure a flawless base to which a final finish can be applied. Wet sand
and buff, and then reassemble ( interior and all glass and rubber has 
been removed ofcourse, we do'nt like overspray and paintlines do we?)
And of course this is a Porsche, it demands attention to detail to get 
a "factory finish and fit" as opposed to a kit car you can build in," a few
weekends in your garage with a few simple hand tools". So thats the 
skinny on a 959 body conversion. Slopenose is easier in  that you
maintain factory 1/4s at turbo width, cutting in brake ducts. Front 
fenders are a bolt on, as well as front valance and box rockers. Been 
there and done that too!  So It comes down to " Time is money,
craftsmen cost money, Porsches cost money. Compromise and thats
what you will get. However on the track pretty bodywork do'nt go no 
faster....;>)
