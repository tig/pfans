Andy:

Most cars retain the mechanical locks when remote-actuated power
locks are installed; if the battery dies, you can still unlock the
doors with the key.

On cars that ONLY have remote-activated door locks (e.g., custom cars
whose exterior door locks have been shaved off for a sleeker look),
there's usually a hidden 9V-battery connector somewhere under the
car... You plug a 9V battery in there and it applies enough power to
unlock the doors.
