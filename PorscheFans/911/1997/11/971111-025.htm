Ed,

My brother's 993 is not one of the cars that allegedly has experienced
accelerated cam wear - the mechanic just told him about it when he
brought his car in with some Mobil 1 15W-50 for an oil change and other
service.

Like you, I am a 'lubricant fanatic', and have been using oil analysis
services on my own cars. So far, no problems have surfaced - but I don't
have a 993. Now that you mention it, I suppose I should recommend to my
brother that he do an analysis on the oil in his car. If there is
accelerated cam lobe wear, I suppose we would see Iron at excessive
levles in the oil. He'll need to wait until he gets some mileage on his
fresh oil change though.

I would still be curious to hear if this 993 cam wear problem is endemic
or just anecdotal.
