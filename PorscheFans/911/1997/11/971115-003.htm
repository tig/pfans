Francois Duval inquires whether there is a fix short of rebuilding 
the tranny for grinding during a 5 to 4 downshift in a 915 tranny.  
It is possible that there is something wrong with Francois' tranny.  
However, mine is recently rebuilt, and I still experience this from 
time to time.  I've been assuming that what needs to be "fixed" is 
the driver.  I think that, in the excitement of getting braking, 
blips and double clutching and all done in a hurry, I'm simply not 
coming far enough left with the lever, possibly in part out of  fear 
of going too far left and catching 2d instead of 4th.  If there is 
some tranny fix for this, I'd welcome hearing about it.  Otherwise, I 
think it's just a matter of practice and feel, as seems to be true 
with so much of Porsche herding.

I've also occasionally experienced the lever seeming to stick in 5th. 
This hasn't happened often enough for me to describe it any better.  
When it has happened it's been a pretty firm stick, to the point 
where rather than forcing the lever I have simply let the engine 
wind down until the lever decided to come loose.  Has anyone else had 
this happen?
