Folks,
If things go according to plan, I will be the proud owner of a 78' 911
SC on Saturday. I have a couple of basic questions, hope I can get some
help from the veterans.
1) Driver Ed School, I am really interested in going to a Driver's Ed
school. Problem is I live in the Midwest (Moline, IL) and would like to
know what is the best way to go about doing this in our 'El Nino'
stricken weather. How long do I have to wait before they start offering
classes in Ohio or IL. Any contacts I can have to get some info, email,
www sites, phone numbers.
2) I don't have a garage right now. I have asked a friend to get me one,
but it is 5 or so miles away from my house. Is there a good car cover I
can buy for the 911, so that I don't have to part with it everytime
there is a snowflake on the ground.
3) What would a be a good book on driving techniques for a 911. I have
lurked around long enough to hear a few names, but would prefer a little
more thorough mention of the book, maybe an ISBN number so I can order
it from amazon.com.
Help is much appreciated.
