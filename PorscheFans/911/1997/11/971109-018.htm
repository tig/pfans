I've never owned a car with power locks before.  I was wondering what people
do when their battery goes dead with the car locked?  I tried locking my 86
Targa today and removing the negative from the battery, and of course the
locks didn't work.  Anyone ever had their battery go dead while the car was
locked?

Also, I picked up one of those Moch 1 underdash panels.  Has anyone installed
one of these in an 86 Targa?  I don't see how it can physically fit (hits the
cruise control box, the opening around the ashtray is too small, and it seems
to be too long to fit under the dash)...hmm but maybe I'm installing it wrong?
 <g>   It looks like I will return it.  I got it on sale from Automotion.  If
there are special tricks to getting it installed please let me know.  TIA.
