Tuomas-
           There are basically two areas to look for routing your wires from
the dash to the luggage compartment/trunk.  Open your hood and pull the snaps
off your  carpeting at the rear of the compartment--center mat as well as the
rear most portions of the side mats.  Looking under the hood on the far right
side against the firewall is where you'll find the main wiring harness feed
through from the trunk (and fusebox) into the passenger compartment.  You may
find a place or two to run wires through here.  Also on the far left hand
side (behind and outboard of the hood strut) there are some wires for the
blower and underhood light going through the firewall.  It looks like it
would be easy to sneak wires through the existing grommets here.  
     Remember to 'camo' your wires by wrapping tape around them and  factory
bundles whereever you can.  Also, you are right to be cautious about drilling
as I saw a mid 80's Carrera that had a pretty devastating electrical fire
because some bonehead attached the alarm brain to a convenient spot under the
left side of the dash and used sheet metal screws to make it nice and
secure--you guessed it a screw pierced one of the main wiring harness bundles
I spoke of earlier and managed to find an inadequatelly fused hot wire
(couldn't tell which one as all that was left was charred wires with no
color-coded insulation left).
     Hope this helps,
