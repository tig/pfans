David, I have been using a Colgan bra on my 993 for a little over a year.  
Could have gotten the Porsche OE for same price, looked similar, but 
coould not get it with no front license plate cutout (we don't have front
licenses her in PA).  The Colgan fit pretty well, only problems are that
you can't leave it on for long times, especially after having it out in
the rain (dirt/water gets trapped around the edges).  I have found also it
is easier to clean off the bra with it on the car rather than trying to clean
it after removal.  It still seems to rub slightly around the top of the
fenders,
so look at the fender tops from time to time and keep a good coat of wax
on the car to cut down abrasion.  

My method right now is to use it for long weekend trips, take it off the car
as soon as I get back home.  I don't use it for local running around, but if
trip is longer than an hour or so, on it goes.  Considering the considerable
amount of dirt/gravel on local roads, car would look like junk right now 
without it.

Hi Porschefans

Does anyone have any preferences for a 993 front bra.  Because of
concerns for scratching and paint damage I have not used one up until
now.  I'm familiar with the names, Colgan etc. but have no experience
with how they perform in actual daily use...  Please cc me in your reply
if possible...

Thanks in advance
