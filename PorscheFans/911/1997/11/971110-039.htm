John Watson (johnapmec@hotmail.com - 1974 911S) asks: 

"since i'm about to do my first spark plug change on my 911, I though
I would ask for a little advice.
 1)should I change the plugs with the engine warm or cold?
 2)what kind of anti-seize should I use on the plug threads?
I work on aircraft, and I know how easy it is to screw up the threads of 
an aluminum head. This is why I'm asking. Thanks for the help."

John - I think a lot of folks on the list could learn more from you as a
certified aircraft mechanic than you from us:  what is the drill in the
aircraft world, where more is on the line when things fail?

However, I'll give you my self-taught experience for whatever it might be
worth:   1) - it doesn't matter.  I've pulled plugs hot to read them at the
track, or to change them.  I've pulled plugs cold to change them. So far,
so good, haven't ruined any threads in a dozen  years of messing with
my own Porsche(s), plus 20 more messing with their predecessor Vws. 
Generally a little more comfortable with engine cool.  You'd think it would
be easier also when cool, differential expansion being what it is.

2) Antiseize and plugs is a little like theology:  is it good because it
prevents galling, corrosion, seizing, all bad things.  Or is it bad because it
inhibits heat transfer from the hot plug to the cooler (or at least
somewhat cooled) head?  I like to use a touch of it just to be safe, as I
have never noticed any bad effects on the plugs from using it, and my
heart heads for my throat whenever I have to use a wrench for more
than a half turn or so while backing a plug out (after which I slip a piece
of rubber hose over the ceramic and twirl it out).  

You, however, are spared another complication:  it is said that some
things adversely affect oxygen sensors:  silicone being one, and the
wrong antiseize being another.  I looked at what Permatex had to say for
their antiseize, and for what it is worth their tubes and jars say it can be
used on oxygen sensor threads, so they don't think their product is a
problem.  But I digress, as you don't have an oxygen sensor to worry
about.
