Mark:
  You are right 1/4" is probably too large I guess the actual size is
more like 3/16" but I think many places sell this size as 1/4".  Anyhow
I used to use a thinner rope but then I started tearing some older
rubber seals that I have had in stock for the last 10 to 12 years.  They
were not cracked or dry rotted and they still had their protective
coating on them.  They had just gotten stiff.  Sometimes I get rubber
from suppliers that is in the same condition so you never know how long
these things have been kicking around.
  Anyhow on with part two:
The Targa seal is especially stiff and cumbersome so it is best to put
this on in a heated garage or perhaps use a heat gun to keep the rubber
soft and pliable.  They go on easier in the summertime, but you may lose
10 lbs. from profuse sweating.
  There are two channels in the Targa seal, one is for the wires (outer)
and the other is for the glass (inner).  It is easy to put the glass in
the outer channel but this is not correct and will not work.  Before
putting the glass on the window, make sure that all electrical clips are
in place.  If they have pulled off during removal they can be
resoldered.  Make sure they are pushed flat against the edge of the
glass and then you can begin to install the seal to the glass.  It is
easier to put the front part of the seal (adjacent to the Targa band) on
first, this will enable you to line up the corners properly.  The seal
will want to flop off as you work from one side to the other so keep a
roll of 2" masking tape or duct tape to tape the seal down hard to the
glass once in the channel by wrapping the tape from one side of the
glass over the rubber to the other side of the glass.  You will only
need to do this 2 or 3 times one the front of the seal but the back
portion is much more difficult and you may have to tape every six inches
or so.
  Once the seal is safely secured to the glass you can place the glass
in the opening of the car to help you locate the area to put the holes
in the seal for the defroster wires.  Hopefully you have the old rubber
to see how the wire is routed through 3 holes from the inside of the
seal to the outer wire channel.  You can use a sharp ice pick for this,
but be careful.  Push the pick back and forth to expand the hole.=20
Snap-On makes and excellent needle nose pliers which has teeth with a
backward rake.  If you push these through the hole in the rubber you can
grab the wires in the center of the connector clip and pull the whole
clip and wire through the rubber.  You will have to do this 11 (eleven)
times so you will be good at it when you are finally done.
  The ground wire runs to the right side of the car and the two hot
wires run to the left side.  There are three clips on each side of the
window. The ground wire goes to the first clip on the right side with
jumpers between the first and second, and second and third clips on this
side.
The hot wires go to the first and second clip with a single jumper from
the first clip to the third clip on this (left) side.  Run the wires
under the tape holding the rubber on because you will be pulling and
twisting the rubber putting the wires on the clips.  Locate the position
of all the clips and place the wires in the outer channel with the ends
in proximity to the clips.  You may have to untape and retape as you do
this.  Now you are ready to install the wires.  You must poke a hole for
each connector between the wire channel and the glass channel about =BD"
away from the clip for each connector.  Pull each wire through these
holes by the connector with the needle nose pliers and connect to the
clip on the glass with the pliers.  You will have to reposition the seal
on the glass after completing each clip taping and untaping as you go
(Are you having fun yet??). =20
  If you have completed all this in less than three hours you did well
and you deserve a break and maybe a stiff drink.  If this is your first
time, I doubt that you did this under six hours in which case you will
probably need a good nights rest while you wait for part three or the
final act of Porsche supreme lunacy.  Every time I do one of these I
console myself by thinking that there is some poor slob in Stuttgart,
Germany who had to do these everyday.  I know he retired to the looney
bin.
