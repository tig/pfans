Well I give up. Trying to trace the fuel pump wiring on my 73.5 with CIS has 
been a bit of a challenge. The electrical schematic (Haynes) shows the fuel 
pump connected to fuse #7, no relay evident. So I pulled fuse #7, expecting to 
hear the pump stop pumping. It didn't stop! I then searched everywhere else I 
could think of for a fuse that might control the fuel pump circuit. Nothing. Then  
I reexamined the connections to fuse #7. A black wire (which goes off to the 
rear window defogger switch) is connected to one end of the fuse, while a 
red/green & a red/black line are connected to the other... exactly as the 
schematic shows. So I disconnected the red/green & red/black lines from one 
end of the fuse &, lo and behold, the pump stopped. In effect, the fuse seems 
to be functioning only as a convenient place to connect two wires carrying 
current to the pump.Shouldn't the current for the fuel pump flow THRU the 
fuse to protect the circuit? Is the schematic wrong? Is it likely a PO moved the 
wire to bypass the fuse for some reason? Do I just not understand how electricity 
works? All of the above? Any help gratefully received. Jim Taylor,  '73.5 911
