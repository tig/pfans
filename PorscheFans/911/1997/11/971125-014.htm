Jeff,

How old is (are) your little (?) one(s)?

I've been using a booster child seat popular here in Europe for kids above
the age of four.  Our Emma is only three, but by using it, the seat belt
fits nicely and since there is no back rest portion, it all fits.  Mine is
made by Klippan, I think, but there are many available. I tried at least a
half a dozen seats (all the major makes here in safety-conscious Finland)
with back rests included that use the three point belt for restraining the
child.  No luck. The thickness of the seats added to the already miniscule
leg room (remember - their feet point out horizontally at this age) made it
only possible in the psgr. side with the front seat all the way in the
front - not really an option.  As to Krista, 20 mos., careful in-town
driving only with similar setup.    This is not really good, as she needs
more support and should actually be rearward facing, but that's what the
Audi is for...

Actually, if anyone has any better ideas, let me know.

Greetings Porsche fans,
    I am looking for a childs car seat that will fit in the back seat of my
82 911SC Coupe. I remember seeing the same question answered in an older
issue of the Panorama, but have been unable to find it again. Any help
would be much appreciated.
Thanks,
