Mr. Brian Buxton asked about spark plug wires and plugs for a 930.

We have some experience here that may be helpful to him and others.
While the OEM Bosch plug wires are fine, there are some other products
that seem to work a little better and certainly last longer. On a
turbocharged car that makes a great deal of engine heat, this is even
more important.

We have had excellent luck using Magnecor plug wires and their
proprietary plug connectors. They make two sizes of plug wires, 8.5mm
and 10.5mm. Th smaller of the two is the recommended one due to the
requirement in fitting inside the plug connector ends. Their wire is a
very high quality spiral wound suppression wire that we have found to
solve a lot of problems with EMI. Indeed, with the Electromotive
crank-triggered ignition systems, these wires solved a myriad of running
difficulties. We now use these exclusively. 
The OEM plug connectors have been a constant source of grief for Porsche
owners since the early 1970's when the problems with the internal
supression resistor began to manifest themselves.  Intermittent rough
running and slight missing, all the way to outright ignition failure on
one or more cylinders, have been traced to faulty spark plug connectors.
No longer inexpensive, these items can be replaced with the Magnecor
ones that have NO internal resistor. No more plug connector problems.
The necessary suppression required to protect the Motronic and your
entertainment system is supplied by the suppressed wires.

We have no connection(no pun) to Magnecor. They are simply an excellent
product that finally solves a long-term problem. Many folks sell them
and in fact, they have an excellent web site that has a great deal of
information about ignitions. A definite Bookmark!!!
http://www.magnecor.com

Brian, for spark plugs, we prefer the stock Bosch plugs unless you are
running more boost or compression than what is stock. We have less
problems extracting Bosche plugs than any other brand. At least for us,
they are the most consistent plug wehave found, to date.

I hope this helps.
