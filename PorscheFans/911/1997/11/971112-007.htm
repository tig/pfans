I have a 77 911 and would like to understand the heat and fresh air
system for this particular model (ie, what was available).  As far as
I can tell there are no fans for fresh air on my car.  That is, the upper
right lever is not attached to anything (it was that way when I
purchased the car).  The car was equipped with an after market
under dash A/C unit, and as such has a blower "behind" the dash
(in the trunk).  The engine has been replaced with a 3.2 with no
extra attachments (ie no A/C or heater blower).  I can pull the 
2 levers between the seats and get hot air, but have no control 
over the force of the air.   Can a blower be added that will give
me that control?  If so, where would the switch/nob go to adjust 
the force?  As to the unattached fresh air lever, could this have been
disengaged due to the aftermarket A/C that was added (since it
has a blower).  Or did this model not have fresh air blowers?  If
it did where would I look to see if they are there?  Can the blower
for the A/C unit be used instead, even without the A/C unit being
connected?  I would like to get a basic understanding of the workings
of these pieces so that I can see where I can go with it.  Any help
would be appreciated.
