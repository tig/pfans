Porsche produced a 911 Carrera 3.0 in Europe from 1976 until 1978 (I =
think). Can anybody tell me... What is the difference between a Carrera
=
3.0 and a 911 SC? The specifications seem so very similar, yet the =
Carrera seems to be regarded as superior.
(Side question) Does anybody know for sure... Does the 911 SC need =
leaded to run with fuel?

All the best, regards,

The SC inherited the three liter displacement, but I believe that the
case, bearings, etc, were from the turbo.  Also, the SC got a very high
level of standard trim and amenities.  It was also a heavier car.
Maybe someone else knows, but I also think the flared fenders in the
rear were adopted from the turbo car.
It does not need leaded fuel.  It will run on standard grade unleaded,
and must do so in the US.
