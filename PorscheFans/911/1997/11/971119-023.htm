Greg,

I live in the SF Bay Area and bought a Porsche in June.  I figured it
would be a good idea to join the local PCA region, the Golden Gate Region.
There is also the Loma Prieta Region in the area and some others that
aren't quite as active.  I didn't realize at the time just how good of
an idea it was.

After my car was broken in, I hit the PCA autocross trail and competed
in 4 LPR, 6 GGR, 6 Zone 7 autocrosses.  These are held at 3Com Park,
the Dublin Sheriffs Facility, Mather AFB, Carson City, NV, and in the 
Laguna Seca paddock.  There are alot of good instructors available to
help you out and just alot of nice folks.

The GGR also has time trials during the year.  I have only attended one
of these, but am thinking about another at Sears Point in early December.
Hurley Haywood was the guest instructor at Thunder Hill and he even 
offered to drive my car for several laps.  There are other activies within 
the PCA, but autocrossing and time trials are all that I have had time for.

And there are alot of other associations in the area where you can get 
track time, but they don't seem to be as education oriented.

See http://www.pca.org/ for more information.
See http://www.wenet.net/~seppi/images/993c4s.jpg for my baby.

Good luck,

Dan Jones
