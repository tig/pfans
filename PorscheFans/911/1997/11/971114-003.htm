I think he was using the early 911's as a reference. The 2.0 - 2.4 engines were very
peaky and needed to be up on the cam more than the 3.0 - 3.x's. The older 'S' engines
really didn't like it much below 4000 rpm and really fouled the plugs if they were idled
for a long time in the 1000-3000 range. The mechanical FI is really flat between 2000 and
2800 (but kicks from 4500 to the redline!)
