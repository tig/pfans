> Subject: Airbags and Helmets Warning
> 
> I want to warn everybody that there may be a danger with airbag
> deployment removing helmets, particularly closed-face helmets.
> 
> In October at a PCA drivers ed event at Watkins Glen, an instructor with
> a student in a nearly new stock 993 spun in the inner loop and shot
> across the exit to hit the outside Armco and tires at nearly 100 mph.
> The tires did their job and the car was shot 4 or 5 feet into the air
> and backwards where it came to rest shiny side up in the middle of the
> track. The airbags deployed and apparently removed the closed face
> helmets from the heads of both occupants. The passenger's hemlet was
> found on the other side of the Armco. Both were using standard 3-point
> belts. The force of the collision caused the driver's stock carbon
> kevlar seat to bend clockwise 20 degrees. Both were transported to the
> local hospital and released after being examined.
> 
> I can only speculate that this was not an incident of carelessness
> involving not having the chin strap on securely since it affected both
> occupants. I think the airbag came in contact with the chin portion of
> the helmet and forced it downwards which made the back of the helmet
> ride up and off the head.
