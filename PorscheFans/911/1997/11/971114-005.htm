Even though this could have been put on one of the other boards, I felt the
911 board is where I would find this.

I am looking for a video called FAZINATION.  This was a 2 tape video. The
first an on board drive in the RUF yellow bird at the Ring, and the second
tape was at the RUF factory

Those who have it know what I am talking about..............

If anyone has these tapes collecting dust I would like to purchase these from
you.

I missed the opportunity to buy this at the 94 parade, and have been kicking
myself ever since.
