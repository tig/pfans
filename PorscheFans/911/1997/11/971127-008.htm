Hi all,

I mistakenly attempted to answer two posts with one response and may have
created some confustion, so I'll try to clear this up:

To Everson Hull (greg1@erols.com)
The first paragraph of the message is regaring the fact that it doesn't
appear you'll need
a pop-off valve because the K&N cone filter, if I understand you correctly,
replaces the filter
box on the motronic injection system at the mass flow sensor.

To: Randy (R3126@aol.com)
You DO have an air box and the second paragraph was my explanation of the
airbox and what
happens if it is blown.  The pop-off valve costs somewhere around $12-15,
the air box is around 
$350 (the last time I looked).  Installation of the pop-off valve is
relatively easy with the engine out
of the car, but is a pain with the engine in due to the lack of clearance. 
Detailed instructions should
come with the valve itself, but basically involves drilling a roughly 3"
hole down from the upper 
chamber to the lower chamber and gluing the valve into the box with epoxy
provided with the 
installation kit.
