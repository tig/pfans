I experienced intermittent starting problems lately in my '84 911 with 150k 
miles on it.  Symptom was a click and no other noise in response to the key.  
Also, the after market installed digital volt meter was reading about 0.5 
volts lower than what several of us including list members thought it should.  
BTW a belated thanks to all that offered their advice and source of 
replacement parts.  Long story and too many replaced parts, like the starter 
and probably alternator too. Later we found the problem.

The main electrical cable connection to the positive terminal of the battery 
was loose.  The wire inside the lead connector was a touch corroded and was 
mechanically loose.  The solution was to cut the wire a few inches up from the 
end and to use a connector that allowed soldering of the wire in the 
connector.  The OEM part depended on mechanical pressure, i.e. squishing of 
the lead sleeve around the wire, only.  Went on a long driving vacation and 
have been commuting for the last couple of weeks, no problem.
