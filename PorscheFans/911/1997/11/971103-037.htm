David, 
	Now that is surely a 'new one' on me, the WD40 for vinyl.... I am an 
enthusiastic user of the stuff on stuck parts, etc, but never on vinyl, or, 
heaven forbid, leather.... I would imagine it would dry these things out 
rather than keep them supple. However, as the theory with Hide Food for 
leather seems to be replacement of the natural oils that dry out with 
time/sun; I guess that, vinyl being petroleum based, and WD40 also being, 
there is a theoretical possibility that it might work... but gut feeling says, 
"Naw, that's ridiculous, can't work..". I look forward to reading the replies 
to your post on the Pfans List.! You're sure your post isn't a joke, now.... 
By the way, I think Armorall is pretty good on vinyl, but I'm not as sure 
about leather, as some insist it will dry leather out. Personally, I don't 
think so, given my car's condition after quite a few years of light use of the 
stuff. On the other hand, nobody ever seems to use it on one piece of trim and 
not another, just to see the difference. Anyone ever hear of a test by say, 
Consumer Reports? O well,  who the heck knows for sure....Warren.

****************
I used to use armorall in my vehicles, but was warned that it would actually
dry out the dash, and once you started using it, you ALWAYS had to use it.  I
A few weeks ago, on a testdrive of an '87 Carrera, the owner of the car
explained to me that WD-40 made a great dash protectant.  I thought he <snip>

So, this weekend, rather reluctantly, but curious, I "did" the dash of my VW
with the WD-40.  Wow!  It looks great!  All of the dry-looking spots left over
from my armorall days disappeared!  And the stuff spread really evenly.  And,
it's not greasy like armorall, and doesn't leave finger prints when you touch
it.  I'm IMPRESSED!    Anybody got any ideas why NOT to use WD-40 on the dash?

Dave
