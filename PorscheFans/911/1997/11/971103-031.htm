Hello P-Fans

When I put Pirelli P5000s on my '79 911 SC, I put 225/50 on the front
and 250/55 on the rear.  (I'm quoting those sizes from memory)  The
front were $AUD310 each and the rear were $AUD360 each - fitted and
balanced.  Total for a set of tyres that'll probably do around 15,000
kms was $AUD1,340.  Working on an exchange rate of around
$US0.70=$AUD1.00 that comes to $US938.00.  I am in Darwin, Australia
which is 3,000 kms by road from the nearest other state capital
(Adelaide, South Australia) and the tyres come up from Perth which is on
the western side (where the America's Cup had a sleepover for a while!).
On my 4WD (Mitsubishi Pajero) I put Bridgestone Desert Duellers at
$AUD750 a set of 4 fitted and balanced and I kept the best of the
previous set as the spare.  (That car has 304,000 kms (188,500 miles) on
it and just doesn't stop)
Fuel here in Darwin is 83.9 cents per litre which roughly equates to
$AUD3.19 per US gallon (working on 3.8 litres per gallon).
Car prices are higher here too due mainly to import duty and currency
exchange rates.
A Boxster is around $AUD110,000 new.  Last years 911 without any
optional extras like turbo was around $AUD215,000 and the top of the
line was around $AUD295,000.
A run-of-the-mill '86 944 is around $AUD30,000.  A 1994 911 will set you
back around $AUD140,000-160,000.  Buying a new 911 is doubly expensive
because the price drops off by the tens of thousands.
However, since the Indonesian currency has taken a huge beating this
year, you could probably buy a 911 much cheaper there simply by
utilizing the power of your own currency but then you'd have to pay some
import duty somewhere.  The Indonesian Rupiah has dropped about 30-40
percent so you get a discount there.
If you're thinking of shipping Porsches here to sell, there are already
people doing that.  If the car meets the Australian standards for
emission control then you'll be in luck but if it doesn't then the car
is immediately worth around 15% less and you have to find a cash buyer
which takes longer.  The reason is that some states won't register a
vehicle (depending on it's year of manufacture) if it doesn't come up to
pollution control safety standards and standard leasing companies won't
finance vehicles that aren't Australian-compliant because they're harder
to sell.  Also, British delivery Porsches aren't as desirable by
enthusiasts because of the risk of getting salt-induced problems.  I've
only heard about it but I think some of the roads in England have salt
poured on them to melt the snow and that salt gets into the underbelly
of your 911 and starts to corrode and damage things.
