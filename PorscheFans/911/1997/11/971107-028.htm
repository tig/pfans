Everything Hank says is true.  Add to this the fact that the MASS in
front and rear haven't changed...so when you apply the brakes, the load
on the rear wheels lightens, while at the same time the 60/40 (or
whatever) rear MASS bias still exists.  As the centrifugal force
increases (pushing proportionately heavier parts more than lighter parts
toward the outside of the turn), the rear end will want to move toward
that outside faster...thus oversteer.  Maintaining speed or accelerating
decreases the amount the rear end "lightens", which in turn decreases
the relative amount the rear end wants to move toward the outside of the
trun...thus decreasing oversteer.
