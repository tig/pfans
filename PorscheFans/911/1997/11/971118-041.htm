Pfans,

OK, this has been bugging me for a while.  Bear with me on this:

Many of us have had the experience of the phantom puff
of smoke at start up, which then goes away.  We've all been told
this is normal.  Conventional wisdom would suggest this to be a function
of valve guide wear.  Yet, cars have been taken apart which
occaisionally puff at start-up with no evidence of valve guide
wear (Or so I've been told).

Definately annoying but not necessarily representative of
an engine problem.  I have seen it happen on newer and older cars.

Not only that, but the symptom occaisionally goes away
on it's own.  In other words it can come and go randomly.
In my case, it only happens when there are a bunch of people
hanging around my car.  grrrr. :)

Yet my 2.2T motor never did this.  Many engines never do this.

So if it's not necessarily valve guides, what is it?
Oil obviously leaks past the rings or the valves and sits in a
combustion chamber until the car is started.  But why sometimes and
not others?

One theory I have heard sounds unlikely:

"Random Alignment Theory".

The rings rotate randomly during operation and sometimes line up
to create a channel oil can easily travel between sump and combustion
chamber.  This attempts to account for the randomness.

Do the rings actually rotate in their grooves or do they stay put?
Is there any way to find out?  One mechanic I talked said he
has taken engines apart and found both conditions to be true:
Rings apparently unmoved from their original position and rings
in apparent random position (Evidently people tend to line up the rings
with the gaps 180 degrees apart during installation).

Or perhaps it can be explained by the "High Oil Level Theory":

The other variable which has been suggested is that the puff of smoke
may be more likely to occur when the oil level is high *and* the engine
has been shut off quickly before the oil can collect in the tank, meaning
more is in the sump, ergo more likely to flow past the rings.....
(if the grooves are in a random favorable alignnment...)

My experience does not support this premise.

Any definitive data?

Thanks,

Vol

71T 3.2  Very occaisional smoke on start-up.  Used to happen a lot more.
