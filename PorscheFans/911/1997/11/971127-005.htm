Ted Arneson asked about the max width for this application.  I am currently
using a set of HRE's, 8.5x17 front and 10x17 rear mounted with 245's and
275's the right front rubbed a little on the outside at the fender/nose
junction.  I removed a little of the plastic and the problem went away.  The
problem was only with 245x45x17 R1's the same size in an S02 caused no
problem.

You can use the rear 8's in the front and buy a set of 9's for the rear.  I
have a set of those in the garage somewhere that worked without problem.  On
those I could run 255's in the front and 275's in the rear, R1's.  I believe
the HRE problem is due to the back spacing.  They sit out a little further
than the 8" P wheel.
