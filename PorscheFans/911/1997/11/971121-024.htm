All,

I don't recall the name of the person that wrote the explaination of
rev-matching and double clutching.  You did a very good job.  That is how
it was explained to me by a long time racer and p-car mechanic.  I've
ridden in his car at a drivers ed and his feet were like those of a
dancer.  If you were not watching carefully, you would never know he was
double clutching each and every downshift. He's so smoooooth.  I have a
funny story about his shifting that I'll pass along at another time.

I'm not flamming anybody, because we could all make this mistake.  Twice
in the past couple of weeks, someone, it may have been different people,
has replied to a message and the entire digest was included in the reply. 
Folks, lets all be careful that we don't make this mistake.  Little snips
of a previous message is all that's needed to get the point across. 

Thanks
John
