Hello Mark & Porsche fans:
  Mark is chomping at the bit to finish his Targa window so after
resting from the last episode I'll try to finish this up.
  Hopefully, you now have a targa glass with rubber and defroster wires
carefully installed on the glass.  Unless you are a masochist I assume
that you did this with the inside of the glass facing up, I forgot to
mention to position it this way.  Well now it is time to turn the glass
over and install the aluminum trim moldings.  It is a good idea to have
some assistance when doing this so you don't accidentally pull the
rubber loose.
   I usually use a empty 55 gallon drum with a tire cut in half and
placed on top to support the glass.  This provides a somewhat none slip
surface when installing the rubber.  However, when the glass is
supported with the inside down you have to use a softer surface such as
a blanket to protect the defroster wires which are on the surface of the
glass.  If these are broken or cut all your efforts to install the wire
are for naught.
  With the glass safely positioned, you can now install the moldings. 
Use some lubricant in the rubber channel to help the moldings slip into
the rubber.  Remove the tape from one side of the rubber being careful
not to pull the rubber loose when pulling the tape.  Position the
molding over the channel and press into place holding both sides of the
rubber and having an assistant hold the glass from sliding all over the
place.  This is where strong thumbs come into play.  You should be able
to feel the molding click into place when the rubber pops into the
securing channel on the molding.  It is very important that the molding
is all the way in or it will come out when installing the glass.
Now install the connecting clip and the other molding the same way and
don't forget to install the end clips.
   Now carefully turn the glass over to put the ropes into place for the
final installation.  Heavily lubricate the two ropes as you place them
into the channels.  One rope goes into the channel on the rubber nearest
to the targa band, the other goes around the sides and back of the glass
with two ends overlapping at each corner. 
  Now you will need the aid of at least two strong willed assistants. 
The two helpers can hold the glass near the opening while you insert the
defroster wires through the hole into the engine compartment.  Don't be
a slacker now and leave the grommet out for this will make the job even
more enjoyable.  I will usually try two times to get the wire through
the grommet without it popping out.  The third time it stays out, and if
I remember, I silicone it later.  Do not pull the wire all the way
through at this point because they will have to clear the rope when
pulling and it is easier if there is some slack in the wire harness.
  Now the moment of truth.  Place the glass in the opening and push
towards the targa band as far as possible.  You should try to guide the
channel holding the rope along the pinch welds near the targa band so
that the corners are in position before pulling the ropes.  Now with the
helpers applying steady pressure on the glass (down and forward) pull
the rope up along the targa band on each side about 6 to 8 inches.  Now
switch to the other rope pulling each end evenly around the back of the
glass (pull one side then the other) pulling the rope out in the middle
of the glass in the back.  As you pull the rope make sure that the
rubber is coming over the pinch weld along the entire pull.  If this is
all done correctly the glass should be nearly in place and pressure by
the rubber toward the targa band will be noticeable.  This is where it
gets tricky.  On all other glass you need a little outside pressure to
pull the rope in place, but the shape of the targa glass is already
causing the rubber to be squeezed along the targa band.  Additional
pressure here would cause the rubber to tear.  So with the assistants
holding the glass pushing slightly forward to keep it from popping out
backward push up on the inside of the glass along the targa band as you
carefully pull the rope from one side and then the other.  Push up with
one hand and pull with the other, when the rope passes your hand, move
your hand farther along and push up again until completed.
  Now with the all the rubber over the pinch welds and the moldings
still set in the rubber you can slap the window with you open hand all
along the edges to help the rubber settle into place.  If all this is
successful you can slap yourself on the back high five your assistants
or whatever.  Rest assure you have gone were not many others have dared
to tread.
  Good luck! Hope you get it right the first time, but don't get
discouraged if you don't
