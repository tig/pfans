I remember hearing from my uncle (an engineer) that no-one knows what
happens to the lead in an engine. It doesn't come out the tail pipe, nor
does it seem to collect inside the engine. It just disappears. Am I wrong?

Another point with the removal of lead is what it is replaced with. Here in
New Zealand, they got rid of Leaded fuel about 18 months ago, and for a
month we had huge problems with rubber hoses in cars melting away, and this
caused at least 3 car fires in that month! This was happening because of
the aromatics they had used to boost the octane level after removing the
lead. Amongst the new aromatics were high levels of benzene, (and another
savage one, can't remember what it was) which is poisonous. These high
levels of aromatics melted any slightly older rubber hoses. The last
problem we had(have) is the fumes. The new 96 Octane Unleaded(which
replaced the 96 Octane Leaded), is really hard on the skin, burns slower,
smells worse when raw or burned, and really enjoys clogging spark plugs,
and can vary greatly from tank fill to tank fill in its power.

Overall, removing the lead in New Zealand has removed one potential poison,
and replaced it with another, and started all sorts of problems. There is
more to the Leaded vs. Unleaded debate then meets the eye.
