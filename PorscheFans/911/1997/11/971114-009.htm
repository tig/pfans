Hello A.K.

Running without the cat will indeed make the car louder.  How much louder?
Let's just say, noticeably.  Depending on the muffler you are using, you
may still be under 'legal' limits.  I have a '79 930 and my mechanic
removed the cat when he installed my new muffler and the car is a bit on
the loud side, though still legal.  I have listened to two identical
mufflers (one with the cat and the other without) and you could pick out
the cat-less one easily.  However, the person without the cat needed every
horse he could get and he can run a 1/4 mile consistently in the 10's
(incredible for an Eagle Talon TSI).

I have set off one sensitive alarm system when I drove by the car from the
low rumble of my exhaust.  I am hesitant to go into a closed parking
garage.:-)    You will really notice the noise level increase when you
accelerate hard (it will have the tendency to startle other drivers so be
careful).  There will also be a slight more potent gas/exhaust smell that
will emanate from your vehicle.  On the plus side, you will increase your
horsepower a bit and you will get a louder, meatier sound.  Keep in mind
that your car will fail any emissions testing.  If it is for the track, no
problem, if it is for the street, you may get a ticket.  My 2=A2.  Not sure
about the air pump.

BTW, thanks for all who answered my question about the use of a strut
brace.  This list is extremely helpful and my best regards go to everyone
on it.
