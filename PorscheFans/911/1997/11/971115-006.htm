Garth,

Lots of silent readers on this list have been through their own 
rebuilds.  If it weren't for the list, it is fair to say mine would 
have gone a lot slower, thank you Bob Spindel.  The books were the most 
critical tool, however in my opinion.  I wouln't try it w/o the factory 
manual (hardcopy/fishe), the factory tech spec. book, or the latest 
copy of Bruce's Performance Handbook.  Bruce's book is great because it 
gives someone who doesn't know what their looking at a fighting chance. 
He points out some mistakes in reassembly that, I would think, are very 
easy to make, yet catastrophic if uncaught.  The special tools you'll 
need depend on the model year you are rebuilding.

I know some places in Excelence advertise the factory publications.  If 
you have problems after it is all done and think they may be intake 
related (fuel/air/spark), Probst's book on Bosch fuel injection might 
also become handy.

Good luck. Go for it.
Chris Woodward
