Francois  - you say you have trouble shifting from 5th to 4th, not cured
by double clutching, and think that you hear the zzzzing sound I
onomatopoetically described, and ask if changing oil might fix this, or if an
expensive rebuild is in the offing.

Changing oil won't in itself cure much of anything.  Careful adjustment of
the shift linkage, however, may.  Because you describe your problem as
only occurring when downshifting from 5th to 4th under stressful
conditions (on a track, end of straight, but doubtless with a fast 4th gear
corner coming up so you don't slow much - if it were a 3d or 2d gear
corner, you wouldn't bother with 4th at all, just shift from 5th to whatever
gear you needed toward the end of your braking), I assume you have no
trouble whatsoever up-shifting from 3d to 4th.  That being the case, your
4th gear synchros are probably fine.  And you shouldn't have a bent
shift fork (taking Terry Shugart's suggestion that a bent fork only affects
shifting into the gear away from which it is bent).

Here is why I have on occasion zizzed going from 5th to 4th:  I was
actually starting to engage reverse!  I don't think you can actually get it
into reverse at speed, and the noise would forstall your trying harder.

I acquired this problem shortly after shifting into 2d when going for 4th in
a race.  (although I have seen it happen on the street also, and heard it
when folks with 901s on the track were downshifting to second and
didn't get it quite right)  This is a slightly difficult shift under any
circumstances (though I don't want to overrate it).  When you are under
centrifugal forces it is not made any easier.  If the linkage is not adjusted
spot on, and you are fishing around a bit too far to the right, you hit
reverse.  Adrenaline complicates things also.

The cure was to adjust the shift linkage very carefully.  You want 4th to
be right at the edge of the spring pressure.  When adjusting I pull up the
rubber boot at the shift lever so I can see what is happening there while
moving things around at the shift coupler and making trial shifts in the
garage.  That way you can also be sure that the front to back adjustment
is correct, so that the 5th/reverse lockout pawl is helping and not
hindering things.  Also helps to install solid motor and transmission
mounts (a very good thing to do for any race only car -- you will not
notice any change in "ride."   but said on this list by those who have tried
it to be a bad deal for a streetable car - fillings in your teeth will fall out
driving on street).  Also, I needed to rebuild my confidence that my hand
knew where the gears were.  Trying to avoid second naturally inclined
things to go more toward reverse.  

If the problem is that it doesn't want to go into 4th, but doesn't make nasty
sounds at all, then I'd suspect you are trying to pull it in between gears. 
Or possibly the lockout pawl on the shift tower is in the way because of
a slight misadjustment.

I start aligning things when the need arises by getting the tranny in
neutral, loosening the adjustment lock on the front of the coupler, and
turning both shafts at the coupler as far counterclockwise (facing the
rear, which is how you are likely to be looking at it scrunched in between
seat and doorpost) as they will go.  This seems to get the side to side
adjustment pretty much where it needs to be.  If I am misremembering
this, someone on the list will correct me.

Before adjusting things, obviously you want to be sure that the various
bushings, both up by the shift lever, and back in the coupling, are as tight
and unworn as they need to be.  I like to take the shifting tower assembly
out and use thin washers to take any slop out of the shift lever on its
pivot pin.  

The good news is that if you were hitting reverse, change oil and don't
worry.

Does this make sense to you?
