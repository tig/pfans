Dipping is certainly effective.  It's probably the only way to get every
bit of old paint off, like in the door jambs and hinges,  but it's a heck
of a lot of work, and also expensive.  You have to remove **everything**,
and you have to transport the body and pieces (doors, hoods, etc.) to the
stripper and back. It might be worth it if you were doing a Bugatti which
is worth something, but in my opinion, it simply isn't worth it for your
car.  There isn't that much painted area on a 911 anyway, and even less on
a Targa.

I like chemical stripper.  It's easy to use, readily available, rather
inexpensive compared to dipping or blasting, and can be done in your
driveway.  I've used it on a bunch of cars, including a '72E Targa (yup,
like yours).  It'll take about 2 gallons, at about $25/gal.  In places like
the door jamb, where it's impossible to work with the stripper and a
scraper (unless you remove the doors), I simply don't strip, just repaint.
These are not high wear/stress spots and invariably the original paint is
in good shape and perfectly OK to repaint.
