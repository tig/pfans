I have to say when I first saw the new 996 I didn't like it, but the
more I see it the more I like it.  I am holding out final judgement
until I can see one in person and actually drive one.  I actually 
like the new interior but again want to see it in person.

The 911 hasn't dramatically changed since it was first introduced,
so it is obviously going to be hard to accept a new and unusual 
shape for the 996 but I believe in the long run it will work just fine.

Change is hard for people, but change is good.  Without change
things die.  

Buddy

ps: One good thing about most of you not liking the new 996 it
will keep prices up on my 993!!!
