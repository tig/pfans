Greetings to all,

Like the subject says, I'm looking for a used 911.  I've looked at =
everything advertised in the newspapers here and in the Atlanta area, =
but the nicest car I've found is a 1983 911SC with 120k miles - asking =
$14K.  The Kelly Blue Book web page prices this car at $15.8 k, but this =
one is not perfect - but damn near, as far as I can tell.

This is a gray market car - is that a bad thing or a good thing?  (More =
or less dollars?)

There are three or four tiny places on the car with 5mm or so rust =
spots, but otherwise the original paint is perfect.

Questions:

Does anyone know a good Porsche mechanic in or around Birmingham to =
perform a pre-buy inspection?

What's the best way to handle the rust spots?

In your opinion (in your market)  is such a car worth $14k?  I feel a =
bit mad to be plunking down that much money on a car with that many =
miles - yes, I know it IS a Porsche!

Do you know of a very nice older 911 for less than $20k that might be a =
better deal?=20

Has anyone ever bought an older 911 long distance? =20

Thanks in advance for you help and guidance.
