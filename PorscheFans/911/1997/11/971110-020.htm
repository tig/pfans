Hi group,

I have noticed recently that the brakes on my 87 911 are not as good as =
they should be. For example, yesterday I had to do a hard stop going 60 =
and approaching a green light, which suddenly turned red. Now, I had =
plenty of distance to get the car to stop in time, but it seems =
everytime I push the brakes hard to reduce speed quickly, they lock up =
and I start sliding too soon. I also have a Pickup truck,  and I know =
that it wouldn't have had the problems stopping at this light. Porsches =
a known for excellent brakes, but this one is pretty bad.
Can anybody enlighted me as to what could possibly be the cause for such =
powerless braking? For general information, the front rotors & brakes =
pads are only 3 months old! System was bled at that time, also.=20

I haven't driven another 911 lately, by I am sure that the braking =
performance on my car is not up to par.

Any help will be highly appreciated.

Thanks,

Darrel
