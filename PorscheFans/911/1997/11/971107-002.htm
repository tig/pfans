Can anyone explain the physics of a 911's handling characteristics?  I'm
having a hard time figuring this one out.

I mean, if you let up on the accelerator or apply the brake's in a turn, the
back tends to slide out.

I know that applying the brakes, transfers weight to the front.  But, it
seems to me that the added weight in the back would help to counteract that
force.  And therefore help to maintain the traction.

And, as a counterpoint, It seems as though accelerating in a turn would
transfer the weight to the back and lower the traction of the front tires.
And, using that logic, it seems as though steering would be more of a
problem under acceleration.

What is wrong with my logic here?  Just curious?
