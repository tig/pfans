Hi Porschefans,
        Stupid me drove by a local car lot known to have
a Porsche or two.  This time there was my dream sitting
inside the showroom.  It was black, flared, had a whale
tail.  As I walked into the showroom, my greatest fear
came true.  On the back in perfect Porsche script was
the one word that stopped me in my tracks.  Turbo.
        She's an '87 Turbo, black with tan leather
interior.  Has been driven 35,000 miles and is being
parted with for $35,000.  It had a slight ding in the
passenger door that's being removed.  The paint looked
original but needed a good detailing.  She's living in
Dayton, Ohio.  It's a United States car.
        It appears to be factory, all except for a
HKS EVC boost controller and Borla turbo exhaust(she
sounds sweet, very raspy, can hear the turbo fluttering
in the exhaust, LOUD but not at all annoying like my Supra).
        So, is the car worth it at $35k.  What should
I look out for?  The owner said one of the oil lines
was replaced.  I know the owner of the shop, and he seems
to take good care of cars.  He previously had a 930 Euro
that claimed 20kmiles.  It obviously had 120kmiles on it,
but the speedo was changed over to US and the odo was
certified at 20kmiles.  I think he is offering a warranty
with the '87 though, and it looks to be good at 35kmiles.
I wasn't able to get under it to really check it out.
I think the only problem I saw was that the driver side door
didn't close all the way.  It seemed to take a little more
that regular Porsche door effort to get it past the
second catch.  Dunno if it was in an accident or not.
I was starting to rain, an knowing the temperament of a
930 when it's wet stopped me from taking a testdrive.
I'm thinking of visiting her again tomorrow.
        The only problem is in order to afford this
car I'd have to get a loan from my father.  It is my
dream car at this point, but will I ever see one
like this again?  I could build one from an older 911,
but would it be the same?

Thanks in advance!
