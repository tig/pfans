Hi,

I was asked by a list member about double clutching and rev matching,
thought this might be of some benefit to others...

DISCLAIMER - I hardly claim to be an expert in this - corrections
and/or flames welcome! ;^)

No such thing as a stupid question!

Sure...
 
We'll do rev matching first - If you shift in the "normal" fashion, you
are doing the following (take a downshift as an example):
 
- clutch in
- move shift lever to next lower gear
- clutch out
 
What happens is that before you clutch in, engine and gearbox input shaft
are coupled together by the clutch, hence they're spinning at the same speed.
As soon as you move the shift lever to the next lower gear, though, the
speed of the gearbox input shaft has to change (to a higher speed in a
downshift). Synchros in the gearbox facilitate this.
 
Now, because the input shaft has picked up speed, you have a discrepancy
between the speed of the engine and the speed of the input shaft - when
you release the clutch, the engine has to pick up speed OR the gearbox
input shaft (and hence the rear wheels because you're in gear and hence they're
connected) has to reduce speed to to make up the differential. Without
trying to match revs, it's usually a bit of both... you'll release the clutch
and you'll hear the engine pick up speed but you may also hear the rear
tires 'chirp' as they are instantly travelling slower than the speed of
the car.
 
Rev matching modifies your shifting like this:
 
- clutch in
- move shift lever to next lower gear
- blip throttle
- clutch out
 
The extra "blip throttle" step adjusts the engine speed to the same as the
speed of the gearbox input shaft (ideally). Thus when you release the clutch,
you get no chirp from the tires and the engine does not get sped up by the
car.
 
This accomplishes a couple of things... it reduces the wear in your clutch,
it's better for your engine, and above all it makes the whole shifting
process smoother. Having the rear tires 'chirp' on a downshift probably does
not increase their wear appreciably, but if you're close to the limit of
adhesion in a corner and you downshift without matching revs, the 'chirp'
is probably enough to send you spinning into the trees.
 
Now, the one thing that rev-matching won't buy you is reducing wear in
your gearbox synchros. When you move the shift lever from one gear to the
next, the synchros are responsible for adjusting the speed of the input
shaft to match the gearbox output shaft (through whatever gear has been
selected). Synchros are friction devices and they wear out eventually...
they're expensive to replace as replacement requires a gearbox rebuild.
 
The other technique mentioned, double-clutching, helps reduce synchro wear.
A double-clutched downshift works like this:
 
- clutch in
- shift OUT OF the gear you're in into neutral
- clutch out
- blip throttle
- clutch in
- shift IN TO the gear you want
- clutch out
 
Let's take this in steps...
 
- clutch in
 
Obvious ;^)
 
- shift OUT OF the gear you're in into neutral
- clutch out
- blip throttle
 
Ok - You've decoupled the gearbox input from the gearbox output (you're in
neutral) and you blip the throttle. You're picking up the engine speed AND
the gearbox input shaft speed (because your clutch is out) to a certain point.
The gearbox output shaft speed is regulated by the speed of the car and really
shouldn't change (much) over the duration of a shift.
 
If done correctly, the gearbox input shaft speed has been bumped up to exactly
match what you need in the next step....
 
- clutch in
- shift IN TO the gear you want
- clutch out
 
If the preceeding step was done correctly, you should have the input shaft
spinning at precisely the right speed so that when you perform the 'shift'
phase of the above steps, the synchros do NOT NEED to adjust speed at all,
i.e. the input shaft is spinning at exactly the same speed as the output
shaft (through whatever gear you've changed into).
 
The above sequence saves clutch wear and limits drivetrain shock in the
same way that shifting with rev-matching did, but adds the benefit that
it reduces synchro wear AND can speed up your shifting if done properly.
 
The last claim might sound unbelievable, but you've probably noticed that
when shifting "normally", it takes some time for the lever to 'plop' into
the next lower gear - this is a function of the synchros NOT permitting the
gear to engage until gear speeds have matched up. A proper double-clutched
downshift can actually be performed in less time than a shift without
double-clutching.
 
It takes a lot of practice to get it right, but if you start slowly (i.e.
DO NOT try to make quick shifts until you're really used to doing this) you'll
gradually get better until it's second nature.
 
Give it a try... your car will (eventually!) thank you!
 
Cheers,
 
Ross
