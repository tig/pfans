james:

i've had a similar problem.  in fact, two similar problems.  i have a '75 
911S with CIS.

the first problem was quite vexing: the car would occasionally cough, or 
quit, or hesitate briefly on acceleration.  revs would stay constant 
instead of rising.  very annoying, couldn't find the cause.  finally, the 
fuel pump quit, and the mystery was solved.  new fuel pump, no more 
problem.

now, about a year later, some part of the ignition (cd box, distributor, 
coil, etc.) system is going bad.  periodically the tach will bounce 
around randomly and the engine will misfire.  when it gets bad enough, i 
open up the distributor and clean the points.  it's gotten so i have to 
do this every hundred miles or so.  really annoying...

so the take home messge is:  watch the tach.  if it stays steady, the 
problem is likely to be fuel; if it flails, or drops to zero briefly, 
look to the spark.

i don't know the cause for the second problem, and since the engine is 
kaput anyways (20 psi oil pressure at 4000 rpm...), i don't really care.  
just so the damn thing lasts until i buy a new car.

hope this helps
