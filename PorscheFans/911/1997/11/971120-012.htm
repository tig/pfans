Folks,
So far everything is running fine on my SC. It still idles at 2000 rpm
when I start it, but once it warms up, the idle drops to 1050. I think
it is still slightly high, but I will leave it alone for this winter.
First Oil Change -
When I was driving to IL from Kansas. I noticed that the OEL (oil
capacity needle was fluctuating just on the border of red and white), so
I poured in a couple of quarts and it was OK. But I wanted to be
careful, so I took it to the local Porsche dealership yesterday for an
oil change (I Live in Moline, IL, the only dealers for Porsche is
Lujacks auto plaza). When I picked it last night, the oil pressure was
back at the border of the red area and my DRUCK PRESSURE was running
high. I called them up this morning, after checking the oil through the
dip stick, it barely made it to the minimal oil level (there is no
significant oil in my driveway), my friendly service rep told me that
the pressure was running high because they put in 10W - 30 ! I asked
them what oil they used and he said Northland (never heard of them). I
was charged for 11 quarts of oil.

So to cut it short, I paid $63 for an oil change, and they used an oil I
have never heard of (is it some kind of a performance oil? maybe I am
just naive) and not enough of it, I added a quart of 10W30 Castrol this
morning and things look better. Next time I will do it myself, any
suggestions on the oil I should use for a 78' 911 SC. Any one knows of a
good Porsche mechanic around Davenport, IA, Iowa City, Peoria, IL area? 

Last but not least, what is double clutching? I have been reading about
the need to double clutch when down shifting in SC's, since the syncros
on these babies are a little sensitive to abuse. Is it merely using the
clutch to disengage a gear first and then using the clutch again to
engage it. Just a simple Yes or No will suffice ;-)
