Pfans:
This may be a reach but I was talking with PMO regarding their in-house
developed Webber replacement last week.  In course of the conversation I
mentioned that I didn't see why you couldn't bolt a couple of small
Holly 4 barrels onto a plenum chamber for each bank of cylinders and
have a pretty fair and tunable induction system.  The guy I was talking
to said yes he'd heard of people using Hollies and it may have been
offered by some 3rd party source in the past.  Anybody ever see or hear
of such a thing??  You can still get Holly 4 barrels and parts for
pretty short money compared to Webbers.  This would assume that the
application didn't have smog equipment requirements.
