I am contimplating the purchase of my first Porsche.  I was planning on
buying a 911SC because they seem to sell in my price range.  I have been
told that I should get an '81-'83 because they are "better."  Is there
any truth to this?  I know cars change over the years, especially
911's.  But why shouldn't I buy a '78 and save a few bucks?  Were there
any seriously beneficial changes throughout the SC years?  Do the
Targa's have leaking problems?

Oh, and what am I looking at for annual maintenance cost on an older 911
like these?  Are you guys spending big $$$ per year to keep them running
in tip-top condition?  I don't want to jump into something I can't
handle.

Thanks in advance for any and all responses,

Matt Blodgett.
