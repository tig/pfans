r. warren cramer cheerfully admitted he doesn't know what kind of
tranmsission his SC has, and whether he should be worried about his
first gear breaking off, etc, the way people with big torquey high
displacement engines added to early cars (and 914s) with the 901
transmission have to consider.  I don't know as much as he thinks, but
that's never stopped me:

Warren, you are in luck.  The 915 arrived with the 2.4 in 72.  In fact,
maybe your '81's 915 transmission even has an aluminum rather than a
magnesium case (my '77 had mag) and is even stronger (though mag
tranny cases don't have the bad rep mag engine cases have, at least not
at stock power levels).

Are there any special weaknesses to the 915?  Well, shifting into first is
certainly an irritant, as you must know (especially so, since for me it
seems it is a sometimes thing - usually everything is fine, but when you
have been asleep at the switch and notice the light is green and people
are honking at you - or thinking about it, here in Boulder we are all polite -
, it won't go in).  If getting mad and slamming it into first, and finding you
can't thereafter find all the gears at their accustomed spots because you
have bent something is a weakness of the transmission, that could be
considered one.

There is a way of shifting it so you end up in two gears at once which
locks the tranny and you are stuck and have to get a flatbed to take you
home.  As I recall from the instance explained to me (for once this wasn't
me learning by doing), this can happen if you are still rolling backwards in
reverse, but yank it out of gear and stuff it into another, like first (I think -
reverse/5th shift fork is in a rather shallow notch on the shift rail
compared to the other forks).  I've heard of this only once in a dozen
years, but shop owner who explained it to me and had flatbedded the
car in knew all about it, etc.  Avoidance is be stopped when doing this,
don't rush it.   Cure didn't involve replacing anything a la your friend's
problem, but did require pulling tranny and taking end cover off to pop
things back into their accustomed places.  

Rapid shifts produce rapid wear of the synchros.  continuing this wears
the dog or engagement teeth.  these teeth hitting each other is what you
hear when you screw up a shift somehow and hear a noise, or if your
synchros are worn enough that you often hear a "groink" (a technical
term) when shifting into a particular gear (my speedy shifts from second
to third, of which I was so proud, led to this).  if you keep this up too long
these teeth will wear so much it won't stay in that gear.  Taking it easy
shifting on the street avoids any of this.  Or double clutch (see earlier
posts on this subject from various list members), at least when
downshifting rapidly.

Then there is slightly hitting reverse when you are after 4th, say when
downshifting from 5th - that zizzing sound isn't the dog teeth because
reverse doesn't have any of those because you're not supposed to put it
into reverse while moving.  it is the sides of one or two gears rubbing
against the side of the reverse idler.  other than being embarassing and
adding a bit to the metal paste in your tranny fluid, it doesn't seem to do
much harm if not practiced too often.

Anyway, I would posit that the problems of the 915 are mainly those of
driver abuse.  However, better transmissions doubtless exist (like the
950 from the late Carrera 3.2s on - but you'll have to ask someone who
has one about that.  they seem to like it)  

Stop by Boulder on your way to the Steamboat Springs parade this
summer.  We squeezed our last driving events in last weekend - driver's
ed on Saturday was fine, snowed over night some, autocross the next
day was wet with light melting snow and only the hardy in attendance.

Cheers
