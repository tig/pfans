Dan, it isn't too hard a job.  Trickiest thing as I remember is disconnecting
the solid brake line from the bottom of the caliper up to the mounting point 
on the strut where the rubber brake line connects to it.  You will need some
flare wrenches for this (recommend just disconnecting the fitting at the
strut
and leaving the caliper fitting alone).  Might want to spray the fitting with

penetrating oil and leave it for a day before starting work.  Be careful;
poor
wrench fit or a very tight fitting could cause you to strip the fitting.

The caliper is held in place to the mounting bracket with two Allen-head
bolts.  Remove the pads, then these bolts to remove the caliper.  You 
will then have to remove the caliper bracket; once again, two more Allen-
head bolts.  Would suggest measuring their size with a regular Allen-head
wrench, then purchasing 1/2 in drive sockets in right size (I think 6mm, but
this could vary model-to-model).

With the mounting bracket off, you should see the complet rotor; if you look 
around the stud circle, should see some Phillips-head screw holding the 
caliper to the hub.  I loosen these with a hand impact driver and Phillips
head screw fitting.  Remove them and the rotor should come right off.

After reinstalling  the brake caliper and brake line, don't forget to bleed
the 
brakes.

Fancy tools you need are the metric lare wrenches (measure sizes with an
open-end wrench) and 1/2" drive Allen sockets.  You might be able to use
a regular Allen wrench, but my experience is that they are more prone to
cocking and stripping the bolt heads (something to be careful of on these
Allen-head bolts).  Also, you might not need the impact driver (a big 
Phillips screwdriver might work, but I was more prone to strip screw heads
with the screwdriver).

I've done this on my old '76 911S, '84 Turbo-Look, and recently on the 993.

Hey fellow P-Fans,
(snip)

How difficult is it to remove disc brake rotors ?  I have a Haynes manual but
directions are sparse. Are there any tricks I should know ?  Front and rear.
Any special tools needed?  Should I have them turned replace them?
