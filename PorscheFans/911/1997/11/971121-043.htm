Randy,


Heat can be transferred two ways. First is by direct transfer. The muffler
heats the air, which then heats the bumper. This mechanism is not very
efficient.  Air does not transfer heat well. The other is via infra-red
radiation.  Very low -frequency electromagnetic radiation transfers heat
energy directly from the muffler to the bumper. This mechanism is
efficient.

Coatings designed to reflect infra-red will reduce the bumper temperature.
I'm thinking the coating goes on the bumper, not the muffler. I don't see
how a coating could suppress the emission of infra-red waves. Although I
guess they could make emission less efficient.

The heat energy is reflected somewhere. So you are right in assuming
something else has to get hotter. The muffler would likely run hotter (the
energy would be reflected back to it from the bumper).  Even if the coating
does prevent the muffler from emitting I.R., then the energy from the hot
exhaust has to go somewhere else. Everything  (heat exchangers or exhaust
header pipes, exhaust valves) will be hotter as well.  But since the
third-party turbo increases your engine's  energy output, more heat will be
produced as well.

I don't know what's worse - to have a hot bumper or have the exhaust system
run somewhat hotter. I'd guess not that much energy makes it to the bumper
(compared  the total heat output of your motor).

It would be useful to know how hot the bumper gets with the stock system.
Perhaps  the stock turbo was engineered to give the best performance
consistent with a heat output that will not cook the car. A cooked bumper
may  just be a feature of an engine that now generates more energy.

1971 911E Coupe #0038   -not up to emitting flames but  whose rear panel
gets pretty hot too
