Mr. (Mrs. ?) Nine14,

Thank you for making my point! The 912 and the 911 were targeted at
differents markets, just like the 986 and the 996. In this case they
copied the whole damn exterior. The 912, like the 986, has less gauges
and a lower level of trim in the interior as compared to the upscale car
in the 911 line.

Heck, I would say in overall performance, the 986 is closer to the 996
than the 912 was to the 911.

New and different is always bad when it comes to icons like the 911 or the
356 in her day. As I have said before, 5 years from now this will be
something we will look back on and wonder what the big stink was.
