Hi Joel
My last post should have read as follows.  Sorry, its late:

1:  Place the main yoke in a vise with something to push into the hole in
one of the nylon bushings (like a small socket) from one side

2: On the other side of the yoke , place a large socket  to fit against the
metal part of the yoke, but has a hollow opening large enough for the pin to
be pushed into. (This is what the pin falls into that is being pushed from
the other side)

3: Tighten the jaws of the vise until the bushing pin is pushed out.

4: Remove the dog eared spline from the yoke (the metal thing-a-ma-bob) that
the bushings were holding in (the same thing that you thought you could
never get out)

5: Drift out the nylon bushing from the other side of the yoke

6: Reassemble is in reverse. (Use the vise to press them back in.) However,
I coated the new bushings and pin with dishsoap, which helped them get
seated easier back into the yoke

Enjoy your improved shifting.  If you need to know how to align the coupler
with the shift rod/transmission, drop me a line.
