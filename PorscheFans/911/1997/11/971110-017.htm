All,
 Finally the clutch was replaced on my 87 911 with 65K miles.  Here is the
report about the job.  The decision to replace was made because of
increasingly pressure needed to be placed on the clutch pedal.  it was
beginning to take a real amount of effor to use the clutch. So wife bought
me a clutch kit from Sonnen Porsche on sale $500, reg price $833. (Best
deal seen after months of watching sales). PCNA says there is a bearing
update that needs to be done to 87-mid production 89 cars.  Parts for this
are about $150 and is about 45 min of labor for service bulletin 8902.  For
preventive measure had pilot bearing replaced and oil changed.  Cost was
1051( mostly labor) plus 500 for clutch kit obtained 3 months ago.  Work
was done by local dealer.  Super results! Clutch did show some wear
consistent with it being the original clutch  with 65K miles.  There was
significant drying and some scoring of the old cross shaft and release arm.
The service bulletin really did need to be done.  Clutch action is as easy
as  a 944 or japanese car.   I am glad  the work was done and if you are
getting heavy clutch action on your 87-mid 89 911 consider this work. Its
worth it.
