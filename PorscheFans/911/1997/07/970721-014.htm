I received several requests to "amplify" my comments about the G50
conversion from Patrick.  One deals with a 3.6 conversion in a 1968 911,
which is very interesting, but I believe the package needs to have a
long wheelbase chassis ('69 up?).  Check w/Patrick to see.  I put a G50
in a 1984 911 and a 1973 3.0 RSR.  Both installation packages came to me
complete and very well presented.  The space is tight, but doable.  The
crossmember in the '73 is bent about 1 1/2" out from extra length and
the extras will cause a problem (axle flange compatibility, length of
hyd. clutch tube, 964 pedal assembly changes), but the hyd. clutch is a
must, the 240mm flywheel and clutch means you can buy new RSR parts that
are virtually indestructible (unless you have an RSR pushing them), and
the new pedals are also a nice upgrade if you can brace the front trunk
sheetmetal to keep the assembly from flexing during brake pressure.  The
first time I did the conversion, it took me almost 60 hours, the second,
about 40.  So, the next should be less than a week of labor to install
the whole package.  Call me if you need any help at G&W Motorsports
