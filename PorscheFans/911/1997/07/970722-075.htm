I hate to bring up the subject, considering the fiasco
of multiple messages we all received, but I feel compelled
to let all of you know that I have had a number of dealings
with GPR and they have all been excellent.  I wouldn't hesitate
for a minute to purchase things from them.  To me they have been
polite, helpful and extremely prompt.  The last time I
bought something I was actually the one who made an error (too
long a story to tell) and they cheerfully replaced the part and
refunded my money.  I was more than impressed.

I also have bought a lot from Parts Heaven as the original
poster had, and agree that they too are a pleasure to deal
with.

I have no hesitation in recommending GPR, and indeed, I
have done so here on the list as well as "off-line."

P.S. Usual disclaimer applies.  I have no interest in GPR
other than to see them prosper so I can continue to do business
with them.
