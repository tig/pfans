I am resending it. Here is the story.....

-------------------------
I was driving a '73 914 (FI) on the freeway, and I found that it loss 
all the power. Then I realised that it went out of gas. So I was forced 
to stop on the shoulder. And I fill a gallon later. It started up fine. 
But when I continue to drive for a while, it started to shake. I never 
encounter that before. 

Will this hurt the engine? Does FI need to be service? What problem will 
I see later?

Please help to answer my question, thanks.

Forget to mention, I was TEST driving this car. I am still thinking if I 
should buy it.
