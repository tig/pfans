Hi,

Most pony car owners and Larry with the Prelude S/H are running
full tanks for improved handling/traction. How about in 
rear engined cars with tanks in front?

I have run near empty in my 911S for 12 years but have to try 
something new as my car isn't keeping up with all the
newer fast cars in AS anymore.
So after 2 empty runs on Sunday I filled my tank. The car
felt MUCH better - the front end stuck better entering turns
that it was plowing in before, and braking felt better too
(I usually lock up my inside front when I even think about braking).

I thought I was at least a second faster but was over 1/2 second slower.
I had not made mistakes that I had made on my earlier runs so it
was probably more like 1 second slower.

I guess in a light (2300 lbs) car like mine without much
torque the extra weight hurts overall more than it helps.

So don't belive how your car feels, all that matters (to me at least)
is the bottom line - the time. Any feedback from other rear engine
cars is welcome!

Time to drain 10 gallons out befor the DIVs this weekend
(My SE-R will have a rare treat of 94 octane Sunoco).
