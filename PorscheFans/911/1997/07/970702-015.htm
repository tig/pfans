Did you see the show on the Discovery channel called "Fast Cars"? It
covered Porsche, Ferarri (sp?), and Corvette. It was a historical
comparison of the three cars, and what type of engineering is behind each.
I saw it before we owned a Porsche, but now, I'd like to see it again.
While we were looking, we saw the show you're talking about, and it just
made me want one more!
