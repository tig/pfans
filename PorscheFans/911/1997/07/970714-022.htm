I recently purchased a 78 911sc.  While visiting a remote location this
weekend, the clutch ceased to work.  Specifically, while depressing the
clutch, a popping sound was heard.  The pedal remained stuck to the floor
with the clutch locked in the engaged position. 

 After removing the floorboard cover, I determined that the pedal assembly is
fine.  The pedal, when pulled off the floor (against the resistance of the
floor mounted return spring), left the portion of the clutch cable that I
could observe in a slack posture (running through the tunnel near the
shifter).  I was able to start the car in 2nd gear and nurse it several miles
to a friends home that I was visiting (without shifting or stopping for that
matter).  

A review of the service records show that the clutch and clutch cable were
supposedly replaced some 45,000 miles ago. My question:  does this problem
sound like a broken clutch cable or a broken clutch assembly?  I can handle
the former but not the latter.  If the latter, does anyone recommend a repair
shop near the town of Brentwood (some 15 miles west of the car's present
location) in Northern California.  I live in Berkeley and could also use a
recommendation as to a permanent mechanic.  Is the clutch at the wear limit
and require replacement anyway?  You can reply direct, if possible.  Sorry
for the novice question, but I am truly hoping to avoid a tow or an unknown
shop since I have had bad experiences with both -- damaged rocker panels,
bent tie rods (used for towing), lack of familiarity with car, etc..  Thanks
-- am very impressed with this list.
