Hi P-Fans:
I've seen posts on the list that repeat something I've read for many years (
ex: Road &Track, and such), namely,  that Porsche speedometers are typically
10 % optimistic.  I've tested my own car, a 1985 Carrera  with stock gearing,
and this is what I've found:   
4000 rpm in 3rd gear indicates 60 mph.
4000 rpm in 4th gear indicates 77 mph.
3000 rpm in 5th gear indicates 72-74 mph. 
Knowing that my gear ratios for 3rd through 5th are  1.26:1,  1.00: 1, and
0.79:1, (all through a final drive ratio of 3.88:1),  and knowing the formula
,  mph= (rpm x tire rolling radius)/ (168 x overall gear ratio), and also
that my tires have a 24.88" diameter, the following CALCULATED speeds-in-gear
was arrived at:
4000 rpm in 3rd gear calculates 59 mph
4000 rpm in 4th gear calculates 76 mph
3000 rpm in 5th gear calculates 73 mph.
Amazing! This is "spot on!".  Now this begs the question: is the speedometer
indeed this accurate, or are BOTH the speedo and tachometer 10% optimistic?
 Does anyone out there know for sure?
Regards,
