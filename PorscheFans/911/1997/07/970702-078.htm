i was told that 1998 cars will be 993s.. a batch of 2000 cars to be built
between september and november.  after that the factory switches over to
boxster production (they cannot build 993s and boxsters side by side
apparently) while 996 production will not commence till march or april
whereby the rules allow it to be tagged a 1999 car.

thus 1998 cars are a small batch of 993s and all 996s will be 1999 and
later.

the rags say that the 996 will be "slightly larger" than the 993 but
judging from the boxster it seems that "slightly larger" looks and
feels quite a bit larger to me.

there are some pretty good spy pix in CAR and autoweek.  i really don't
like the styling of the 996, at least from the spy shots.  i like my
headlights round, not with extra large tear ducts or eye boogers... those
tail lights work on the flat tail of the boxster but look out of place in
the 996. perhaps they have taken this parts sharing thing a tad too far.. 

i do hope however, that not everyone is as turned off as me, as it will
be sad to see it sell poorly on account of its styling.
