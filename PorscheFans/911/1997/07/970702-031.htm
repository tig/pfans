Well, my policy (with Farmers) doesn't cover a, b, or c.  Specifically
it excludes: "demonstrations of speed", "timed events", and anything
at a "racing facility".  You'll have to read your policy to determine
if you are covered...  Don't call your agent and expect a legally binding
answer to what is or isn't covered - they don't know diddle, they're
just sales people.  Call an adjuster or someone at the home office for
the real answer...

It's not a matter of "if", it's a matter of "when" and "how bad"...
