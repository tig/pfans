  For those of you struggling with the decision of whether or not to do your
upgrade project yourself, or those who aren't quite satisfied with how your
last effort to perform your own restoration/maintenance turned out:

  In the last month I have had someone else install Carrera tensioners. Labor
was $212...parts $410. I had asked for the newer idler arms. He forgot. Also,
the kit that was used didn't have the recommended support brackets.
  I had a new headliner installed, because I was worried about taking the
windows out myself. I picked the car up this morning. Labor was $965!!!! No
charge for parts because I supplied the  window gaskets, clips, headliner kit
and new chrome strips
for the windshield. When I got the car home I noticed: sunroof with major
scratches, right rear window doesn't close completely, the wiring for the
rear window defroster is visible entering the gasket in the lower right hand
corner and the mirror came off of windshield when they installed it. They
promised to fix everything, but I wish I hadn't had the job done (my old
headliner wasn''t all that bad).
  My advice to all: if at all possible, gather available literature, ask
questions of other PorscheFans, gather your courage and your patience...and
do the job yourself. You will be much more fussy, cleaning everything as you
go, removing rust and painting parts that never get attention. And if
everything isn't perfect in the end, it probably wouldn't have been perfect
if you had paid someone else. My two cents. We'll see if I stick to this
philosophy when again my 77 911S cries out for attention.
