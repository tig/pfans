Then Paul Zwerner and Terry Shugart pointed out that there IS an important
check valve on the fuel pump that should be suspected in such cases.

  Well, of course, the answer is that we are ALL right.  In order to
maintain pressure on the FI, the gas needs to be constrained at BOTH ends.
There is a check valve on the pump to prevent backflow, and a check valve
on the distributor to prevent outflow (to the return line to the tank).
   The gist of all our suggestions is that you have to make sure the rest
pressure remains high when the pump is off.  According to Watson's FI book,
you need to test the rest pressure (using a CIS pressure gauge), and narrow
down the source of any observed leakage by pinching or valving off hoses to
various components.  The list of usual suspects includes the 2 check valves
mentioned above, the cold start injector, and the fuel accumulator (as
someone else pointed out).

  Wow! You must be "killing" lots of them! ;-)
