I own a 88 Carerra Coupe in Granite Green Metallic (grey really) but 
unfortunately have some minor damage to the SUNROOF paintwork which 
therefore need repainting. Obviously the sunroof is a seperate panel 
with a black seal between it and the roof and didn't think there 
would be a problem getting a good paint match. I have contacted 3 of 
the approved Porsche bodyshops here in the U.K. who have all given me 
different answers on the amount of re-painting required.

The 1st said they would need to paint the whole roof to get a good 
paint match, that meant taking windows out etc and their estimate was 
rather large.

The 2nd said they would have no problem matching the paint and would 
therefore only repaint the sunroof  and hence the estimate was 
very reasonable.

The 3rd said they would blend the paint into the roof a bit so there 
was no noticeable difference in colour their estimate was very 
reasonable. Although I can't see how you can blend paint into a 
body panel when it has been laquered!

I want as little as possible painted but I do want the best job (of 
course), I just wondered if any of you fans out there had
experience of having a small area of your car repainted in a metallic 
colour (sorry for english spelling!) and how good a paint match you 
got?

Thanks for any advice
