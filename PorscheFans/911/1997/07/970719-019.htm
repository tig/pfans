>> What does the oil screen cover have to do with oil temp?>>

Bob,

The theory as presented to me was that the oil pickup works better with t=
he
new cover, because it does not have a drain plug in it. So it is a unifor=
m
partial sphere. The down side is that you always have to take it off to
drain the oil as there is no drain plug.

>>You might also check that the 'oil screen cover' is on the correct way.=
<<

Apparently if installed the 'wrong' way, the indentation where the drain
plug is will interfere with the oil pickup. Since the car ran hot and the=
y
were seeking any reason for it, changing this is one of the things they
did.

My mechanic also told me that another cause of running hot was using oil
filters other than true 'factory' filters. His specific example was a
customer who had bought a filter from one of the warehouse car parts
places. The filter was marked for porsches, but apparently does not have
the same flow through characteristics as the 'real' one. Changing the oil=

filter on this car solved its heating problems. I don't have personal
experience with this oil filter problem, just passing it along.
