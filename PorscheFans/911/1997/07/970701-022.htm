Tom,

A VERY common problem in late 80's 911s is for the sway bar mounting
brackets to fatigue and crack thru.  When that happens, it sounds
exactly like you describe (I know).  Look under the car just ahead
of the rear wheels.  If the sway bar mounts are broken, you should
be able to see.  If this is the problem fret not, it is simply repaired
by a good welding shop.  Make sure they reinforce the repair with a
web piece or it will break again (BTDT).

Keep Porsching,
Wayne

I have this problem that's driving me nuts!  When I break aggressively
from 3mph or go over a speed bump at 1-2mph my 86 targa w/60k miles
makes
a sound like a hotel bed that needs oil.  However, the shocks seem good.
Do you think it's the springs.  Is this sort of problem common for a
very
clean car from that era?  Are springs costly to replace?  Is it maybe
not
the springs at all?  Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
Already appreciative Targa Tom
