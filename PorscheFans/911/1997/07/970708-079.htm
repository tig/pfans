Harvey- I recently upgraded to H4's on my '85. German Parts & Restoration
had the best price on them at $125 each. I chose not to get the primered
trim rings (around $40 each I believe). Instead I disassembled the lights,
scuffed the chrome well, primed them and painted them to match my car. Ok,
I'm a masochist. Actually, I don't like the "added on" look of the snap on
trim rings.

Can't comment on H4 versus H1 performance. The H4's seem to work well,
though my true reason for upgrading was mostly cosmetic.

However, in comparison to other modem designs, I'm not terribly impressed
with the H4's. I have 55/100 bulbs in them. In a crude "side by side at
dusk driveway test" my wife's new VW Cabrio had much better illumination.
(I think lighting design has improved over the years.)

Installation is very straightforward (if you're not repainting them).
Remove the old rings, and old headlamp assembly. Plug in new connector,
refit new assembly, adjust aim. 

Hope this helps.

RIchard
