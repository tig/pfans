 Did you notice any difference in the sound of the car? I'm thinking of
 doing this myself, but I won't do it if it severely affects the
 wonderful rumble of the flat-six. >>

Hi,
I currently have a SSI/Monty stainless combination and that seems to work
great. I's a little louder but not much. Also the sound quality is similar to
stock, just a little deeper.  I had a Bursch muffler with the SSIs for about
a week and that was not acceptable. It was loud and the sound was very
different. Almost like a high performance bike. Not very subtle. I like the
normal 911 sound along with the whine and mechanical noises from the engine.
Bye
