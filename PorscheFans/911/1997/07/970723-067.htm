I am a new member of your audience, with a $500 deposit on an '85 Euro.  The
exhaust has definetly seen better days, the engine seems to have no power,
you can hear it miss a beat and make a few other "clunks" that lead me to
believe it may be motor time.  

I live in a rural area of British Columbia, lots of 2 lane mountain roads
and one interstate seldom patrolled, where early in the AM you can travel at
220 KPH +, never taking your foot off, for over an hour (borrowed a
Mitsubishi 3000GT for a couple of months).

I love the shape of the 928, always have, but I'm not married to the motor
and to what I perceive could be a $6000 bill for the rebuild.  Seems to me a
400HP LTI would be a nice transplant, at half the cost and twice the
dependability.

Is there anyone out there that can provide some advice as to books, shops,
or web sites that specialise or have done this.

Appreciate any feedback.  Purists please don't flame me, all I want to do is
drive.
