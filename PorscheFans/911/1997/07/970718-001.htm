Hello,

A little while ago I posted a question on timing for my engine. It was a
3.0l with S cams, 9.5:1 compression, MFI, Twin plugs, early exhaust, and a
Electromotive ignition system. From the responses I received I set the
timing at:

Static =               0"
650 - 1000 rpm =  5" BTDC
3000 rpm =         27" BTDC
8000 rpm =         25" BTDC

The cars idles very well at 750 - 900 rpm and seems to run good except for
one problem  - Detonation. 

I am getting severe detonation under certain circumstances. It is most
noticeable between 2000 and 3000 rpm when the engine is under load. The
ambient air also makes a difference - when the air outside is cool I can't
hear anything, but when it is hot out ( 75" or above ) it is very loud.
Engine operating temperature doesn't seem to effect it ( normally runs
180", peaks on track at 210" ). I use high test gas and 103 octane boost
has no apparent effect.

I am about to leave on my vacation with the car which incorporates two
track events. I have an appointment with my mechanic on next Wednesday in a
last ditch effort to cure the problem. Any ideas would be greatly
appreciated as I am afraid of doing permanent damage to my engine.

Thanks in advance,
Todd Meisner
