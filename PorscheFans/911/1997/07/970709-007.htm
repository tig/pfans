I put H1s on my 78SC a few years ago and was thrilled with the increased
output.  I've got 100W high beams and 50W lows.  I did put a relay in
for the high beams, to keep from burning up the high/low switch.  

Right now, the high beams are great -- like having the sun come back
out.  The low beams are about what you have now, which is not enough
light if you have a chance to get used to the high beams.  I don't know
about H4s, but the H1s have a well-defined light cutoff point in the low
beam pattern.  Because of this, I've been thinking about putting 100W
bulbs on the low side as well; I don't think I'll blind anyone.

Installation was not a problem.

Have fun,
Tim Krone
