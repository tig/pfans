This is a response to the gentleman regarding the 74 911 with a 2.7. I am
unclear if your engine has been rebuilt. However I would caution anyone on
the purchase of any car with over 120,000 miles. The 2.7s are fine if they
havn't been overheated or they have been rebuilt with the neccesary upgrades.
Easy upgrades are the 11 blade fan and a tail for extra cooling. My 74 911S
2.7 has been substantially built with a chassis dyno test of 228.7 HP. I
drive it weekly at speeds over 140 and I can't get the temp over 190. However
something is critically wrong with my motor. It doesn't leak or use any oil.
I'm going to take it into the shop next week for a complete tear down to see
if I can correct that problem. If anyone wants a list of my upgrades for
reference just email me. If this message gets spammed a thousand times, "I
didn't do it".
PS: I got a wild WAV file called "duckjob". You figure it out. If you want
this email me.
