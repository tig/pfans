I am having some sunroof problems and was wondering if anyone may have some
suggestions.  Ever since I have had my car (6mo), I have always thought the
sunroof motor was extremely noisy.  I didn't know if this was normal so I
took the sunroof out and cleaned and lubed the channel and slides etc.
thinking that the motor was loud because of excess strain from sticky/dirty
parts.  After all this, including the zipper blowing out of the 26 year old
 headliner (yea! another project), the sunroof is still really loud and has
trouble doing the last little push to bring the rear edge flush with the
roof.  Does this sound like it is a problem with lube or may the motor be
dying.  Does anyone have any experience with these motors getting loud and
weaker with age?  I've owned many cars with sunroofs, mostly Japanese, and
the sunroofs have never been any noisier than a normal, quiet power window.
 TIA for any help
