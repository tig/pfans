Steve, just a guess; the brake fluid reservior has an overflow pipe on it,
as I remember (at least my '84 and my present '95 do). Would suggest
looking on the reservoir for a built-in plastic nipple that (hopefully) is 
plugged off.  Might have been done by the previous owner (assume there
was one?)

(reply to):

Last evening I was replacing the hood struts on my 88 coupe (Wow!
that left side bottom pin is fiddley to get in) when I noticed a pipe
that was not connected to anything but looked like it should.

The free end of the pipe was discovered lurking near the master brake
cylinder.  It is about 1/4" o.d. 1/8" i.d. and is of dark grey
braided cotton over rubber. It was connected to something once cos
it still has a black cable tie round the end.

The pipe runs from the area of the master cylinder across the
bulkhead to the left wing where it does a 90 degree turn and runs
down the wing.  Just before the fuse box (in fact just above the
windshield washer bottle) it connects in line to a white/clear
plastic pipe where it continues toward the left headlamp. It then
dives through a grommet in the side of the wing near the front of
the battery. I cannot see from under the car where it goes, at first
I thought it was the headlamp washers but it's not.

I sure would be grateful if anybody can tell me what this pipe is or
where the free end should connect to.
