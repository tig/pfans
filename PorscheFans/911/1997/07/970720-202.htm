     I asked a question the other day regarding 2.7 liter relibility.
 Specificly I am looking at a 1974 S model with 119,000 miles on it, one
owner no major engine work performed.  The car has had a recent major service
and a new clutch installed.  The paint is in very good condition and the
interior has been redone.  I've spoken to the mechanic who relayed that the
compression is good, the valves appear fine and the heads are secure with no
leakage.  The asking price is $7,800.  My question is how many miles can I
expect to get out of the engine?   The car drives great and goes like h--l.
 Thanks for the input.
