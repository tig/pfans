Robb,

About your brakes pulling to the right: have you replaced the brake
lines to the calipers?  If they are still the original rubber lines they
may have deteriorated on the inside (look OK on outside!) and cause all
kinds of weird brake problems.  I had an old Toyota Tercel (notorious
for brake problems anyway) that would pull to one side and after
replacing the calipers and front discs, one disc showed excessive wear
within a few weeks.  The lines were then replaced and all was well. 
This may be your problem as well.  I would replace these first before
rebuilding the rest of the parts (assuming that they are original rubber
lines).  Hope the solution is as simple as this . . .
