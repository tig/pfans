Bill Kline:  I have had the pleasure of taking off numerous 911 bumpers
including the aluminum type which is found on the 911SC.  A few simple
tools make this job easy and keep the frustration level to a minimum.  

The front impact strip is removed first.  This can be best accomplished
with a moulding clip removing tool which is like a small v-shaped pry
bar.  Remove the two phillips head screws at each end of the strip and
then carefully pry off each clip with the moulding clip removing tool.
Sometimes the clip receivers will pull out of the bumper and will remain
on the male portion of the clip.  You can remove these from the clip by
placing the large end of the clip carefully in  a vice and use the
v-shaped tool to pry off the ring insert. Unless you are replacing the
white plastic insert strip, leave it in the rubber strip for easy
reinstallation.

Once the impact strip is removed the bumper mounting bolts will be
exposed.  Before removing these bolts, remove the four screws on each
bumper extension.  It is a good idea to have some assistance in the
actual removal of the bumper to prevent scratching the fenders and
valence panel.  If you have to do this by yourself get some 3m
protective  tape and place a strip on each fender and the valance paner
under and over the bumper extension and bellows.  Now you can remove the
four bumper bolts and carefully slide the bumper off of the impact
absorbers. Take note of the rubber pad and any washers that are one the
end of the impact absorbers these are important for proper spacing and
should be put back on in the same manner.  A good idea is to tape them
in place with some masking tape.  

To remove the mustach rubber, I use a long (about 16 inches) phillips
screwdrive with the car sitting up on jack stands under each control
arm.
This screwdrive is somewhat flexable and can reach all the screws
easily.
You can examine this rubber piece to see if the dreaded rust has invaded
the metal portion and has made it bubble.  If its nasty and your budget
can afford it replacement is the best option.  If the rubber is just
nasty looking and there is no rust Marhyde bumper blace paint will do a
beautiful job of bringing the rubber back to original appearance.  I
have seen this for sale at K-Mart for less than $4.00.

Installation of everything is pretty much accomplished in reverse order.
When installing the front impact strip line up the clips with the donnut
receivers in the bumper a good smack with the palm of your hand will
force the clips into their receivers.  If you have a frail hand a rubber
hammer can accomplish this with no damage to bumper.  Good luck in this
project.
