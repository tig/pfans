I may have some good news.  I was talking to a chemist at 3M who is worki=

on developing a new formula for the Stongard material as well as the=20
adhesive.  Their goal is to make it much easier to install and drop the p=

significantly.  Ideally to about $75 installed!  Who knows if they=92ll g=

this low, but at least the price is moving in the right direction.
