Steve,
 I went with the Bilstein Heavy Duty (gas) rear shocks and strut inserts.
I'm happy with them but really don't have a basis for comparison.
Bilstein also make a Sport flavor as you mention and that shock is
a different animal. I think those responding that their cars ride nicely
with Bilstein shocks do _not_ have Bilstein Sports.
The best/least expensive place to get shocks that I know of is RD 
Enterprises (800 683-2890 orders, 619 282-8550 info).
 If your struts are like mine ['86 with Boge struts] the inserts
are very easy to change. All you do is remove the nut on the top
of the strut, compress the strut (jack under the control arm) and
swing the strut outside the fender. [Note: mask the lips of the fenders
with masking tape before you start this job.]  Remove the dust shield
and unscrew the retaining ring holding the strut insert in. Remove the
old strut insert and put the new one in. _Do not_ add fluid to the
strut as many people would advise. I tried this and wound up blowing the 
gaskets inside the retaining rings.  This may be a Bilstein thing. Bilstein
was very nice about sending me new gaskets and advised me not to put
fluid in the strut. Because the compressed gas in gas shocks acts a little 
like a spring they will raise the ride height of the car so you will have 
to adjust the ride height after you change the shocks.
 The rears have a difficult to remove bolt on the bottom - a breaker bar
with a jack handle slid over it (my "cheater" pipe) did the trick.
 have fun,
 Chris

P Fans,

	I recently discovered that my 85 targa needs new rear shocks (slight 
evidence of fluid around both). I think it would be best to replace all 
four shocks since the car has 78K miles. Do any of you have any 
recommendations? I've only had the car for about 7 months and would like to 
start participating in Drivers Eds and autocrosses (if I can find any in my 
area). I think I read here that the "sport" type shocks from Koni and 
Bilstein are too harsh for street use. Are the Koni adjustables a good 
alternative? Where are the best deals for shocks? Lastly, the rear shocks 
appear to be a straight forward replacement, other than getting to the top 
mounting nuts in the engine compartment. However, I have no idea how to get 
at the front struts. The Haynes manual does not give clear enough 
instructions (at least for me). Can someone give me any insight on how to 
do this or is this job better left for a pro? Thanks for any info/hints you 
can provide.

Steve
