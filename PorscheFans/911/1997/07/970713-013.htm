Thomas, considering I went from a '84 Turbo-Look to a '95 993, let me offer
the folowing recommendations (nos in parenthesis are option code nos.
that will be on a label on the inside of the trunk lid)

-  ABD/limited slip differential (220 & 224)
-  17" wheels (398, I think; these were dealer-installed on mine)
-  8-way power seats (437 left, 438 right

The rest to me is a matter of taste (premium stereo /w CD, supple leather,
Carrera 4 with AWD, sport suspension, etc.)

If you are interested in high performance driving, the sport suspension might

be a decent option (# M030).  I found the stock suspension a little floaty &
soft for my taste.  Th M030 stiffens it up nicely but is somewhat harsh on 
rough roads.

What you'll notice:
  - Much easier steering
  - Much more comfortable seats
  - Much added headroom
  - A decent heater/AC unit (good cooling & heating power, good air
distribution)
  - Quieter, smoother engine (but with beautiful exhaust note whan you nail
it)
  - MUCH improved shift linkage
  - Much better ride comfort
  - Reduced steering kickback and bump steer
  - Improved windshield wipers and washers

What you may gripe about
  - I think after your Turbo you will not like the brake feel - they will
feel 
    spongy and lacking stopping power (my biggest complaint)
  - Oil changes are a nightmare
  - Do usually get a puff of oil smoke on a cold start
  - freeway passing frequently requires downshift to 5th, sometimes to 4th
  - Glove box is literally that - a box for a pair of gloves ONLY
  - Seeing those pretty front & rear fender bulges plus the whale tail 
  - Hellacious damage to your bank account!

Might want to consider a '96 - they have more power, prettier 3rd brake
light,
and advantage of OBD-II (I think the '95 is the only year with the OBD-I
system;
this might make it harder to service in years to come).

1995 993
 

I'm looking at purchasing a 1995 993. I'm looking for
suggestions on options that are desirable.

Also, I currently have a 1987 911 turbo, what are the pros and cons
of this trade?

Thanks ,
