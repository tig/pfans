Greg,

	I am in the process of restoring my first 72 T Targa and have been
spending some time with the injection system.  
	This car is roadworthy, but, it exhibits the same symptoms.  The uneven
running at low throttle is most likely due to 

1. mal-adjusted throttle butterflys/bypass screws
2. worn out throttle bodies (mine are going to Beaker Engineering for
rebuild next week)
2. mal-adjusted injection pump

	The misfiring on overrun is due to an over-rich condition, most likely
caused by a non-functioning throttle cutoff switch.  To test this thing,
start the engine and go around back.  On the left intake bank, you will
see a microswitch actuated by a cam on the throttle lever.  Hold the
engine at medium rpm (3000 or so) and push the switch down with your
finger.  The engine should cycle up/down.  If it doesn't, this system is
to blame.  If it does, adjust the actuating screw.  With the hand
throttle down, turn the screw until you hear the switch close, then half
a turn more.

	Funny how much you learn by playing with old toys.  If you need any
more info, let me know.

Brendan
