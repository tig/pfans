The key, as for all 911s, is to anticipate your best cornering
speed, enter the corner slightly slower than that, and accelerate all the
way through. Once you put your foot down to accelerate, DON'T EVER PICK IT
UP! I'm not as good as describing it as Bob White is (U. Chicago, Autmotive
Engineering Professor) but on deceleration, the semi-trailing arm design of
the rear suspension unloads, the rear of the car rises, and if it's
turning, the effect is to kick the tail outward away from the direction of
the turn.

Well, to me that's where the fun begins! Isn't that why we drive Porsches?
You'll have most fun by going into a corner fast enough to create a slight
understeer. Then, to correct the understeer release your throttle (gently,
like you said beware or you'll be looking into the headlights of the guy
behind you!) once you feel the back of the car's coming out, step on it!
Kick the darn thing! Get those horsies to work! Well you know what I mean.
You'll get those great long powerfull slides/drifts and a big smile on your
face (after all that's what it's all about!). If you do it right, they'll
be very smooth (no bouncing off balance left and right and left and…) and
even over all four wheels. YAAAAAHHOOOOO!!
Once you know how the car's going to react and when he's gonna do what,
it's as easy as ABC. Just build it up (yes it takes some nerve, specially
the first time) gently. Pick a favourite corner (one where you can make
sure that you can see upcoming traffic and that gives you some space, just
incase the car decides to kick your ass instead of you kicking the car's -
it'll take some stress of your back). Rain is great for trying out too!
Well, there's a great corner coming up, I'm off, see ya!
