I have a 3.2 rather than a 3.0 engine, but I have heard that the SSI
systems (which I have) also work well on all earlier engines. I also
have a Monty muffler, which I heartily recommend. Great sound and both
it and the SSI are of the highest quality.

According to Bruce Anderson, this combination is worth about 25 HP (on
the 3.2, perhaps somewhat less on the 3.0). There is no other way to get
this kind of HP increase without tearing into the engine
(pistons/cylinders, cams, etc).

BTW, I am going to be on vacation for a week, so don't expect a quick
reply to email.
