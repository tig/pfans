Frank Ahlgren and PFans!:
I'm not sure if I can elegantly describe a limited slip differential- but
here goes. (You may find better responses from others on the PFans list). 

First of all ,your car has ( and needs) a differential for the driven wheels.
When a car is going straight down a road, both the right and left driven
wheels(powered wheels) rotate at the same speed. However, when you turn, the
outside wheel travels farther than the inside wheel. Your wheels that are
powered must "differentiate" this difference in speed, otherwise the gear
train is under tremendous stress.  A cluster pack of spider gears allows this
difference to occur in all differentials. This is called an "open"
differential. For certain low traction applications ( for example, if the
left wheel is on ice and the right one is on solid ground), unfortunately,
the power goes to the lightly loaded wheel- the one on the ice!  We don't
want that . A limited slip differential has( usually)  a series of clutch
discs that "limit" the amount of differential speed seen by the 2 wheels-
therefore some of this lost power ( for the ice example) will go to the wheel
with traction- this is what you want.  For certain performance driving
applications, it is also desirable to have the power more evenly applied to
the 2 wheels. The normal limited slips fitted to Porsches are ( I believe)
40% limited slip. Later versions , under more sophisticated computer control
, have different amounts of limited slip under power, as they do " off the
gas", in a spirited turn. This stabilizes the car somewhat better than the
"fixed ratio" limited slips of the earlier cars, without unduly provoking
understeer. This discussion may ultimately lead to questions of vehicle
dynamics, and we'll let that one go for another time. Or if other PFans want,
we can pick up this thread. Hope this awkward explanation helps!
