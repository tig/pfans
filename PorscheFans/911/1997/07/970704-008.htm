I too am very interested about coverage at DEW. I've heard that there 
is litigation in process or pending in the Connecticut Valley  Region 
involving two drivers who had "incidents" and were refused 
compensation by their insurance.  This sort of incident may put the 
whole DEW program at risk.

Anyone have any info on what's going on? Where I live, insurance 
companies use a standard gov't approve form of binder. As well as the 
usual stuff, "racing and speed events" are excluded.  DEW isn't 
racing but it does raise the interesting question of whether an 
insurance copany might consider it a speed event.

Our region forbids timing equipment and stresses the educational 
part. Anyone care to share tips on how they handle this potentially 
nasty problem? The feeling is that if coverage is denied, attendance 
might drop because not everyone is will to foot the bill if he she 
has an "incident". 

Ted, 

I agree with your comments on proper braking. Well said. 

Bob
