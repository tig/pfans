   Recently I bought a 1987 911 Carrerra Targa. The Porsche dealer who
inspected the car before my purchase noted a few things that needed to be
corrected. None these were serious enough to keep me from buying the car. 
   One of the items that he noted was that the left outer CV boot is torn.
Can the boot only be replaced? Any tips would be helpful.
   On a less serious matter, I would like to upgrade the radio to a more
modern one. The radio in the car now is a Blaupunkt. I am not sure how it is
removed. I see 4 holes in the face plate, one in each corner. Putting a pin
in these releases a spring clip. This still did not free up the radio. I
don't see any other retainers. What's the secret?
