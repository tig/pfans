Jim asked about compression test readings:

Jim the S cam has some overlap and will probably give you low readings. 
I have a race cam in my 912 and I only get about 110lbs.  AS long as
they are even you should be fine.

The best test is a leak down.  The tester is a device that hooks to an
air compressor and blows air into the cylinder when you have moved it to
TDC.  It has two gauges, pressure in and pressure out.  The closer the
pressures read the less air is escaping from the combustion chamber. 
Again you are looking for similarities between cylinders.  Older engines
will actually read higher pressure because of carbon deposits.

But the big benefit of leak down is that you can hear where the air is
escaping.  If it is coming out the case then it is rings, if it comes
out the intake then the intake valve isn't seating, same for exhaust. 
I'm not a mechanic but have used this and seen it done many times.
