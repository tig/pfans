I'm early in my research for a 944 Turbo.

(Please forgive for this post here, not many folks on 944)

It is my understanding that the desired model is a turbo model.

Also, a even more desirable model is the S series.

Combined, a 944 S turbo is the utlimate.

Furthermore, the 88 year model 944 S turbo was the best they made before
stopping at 89.  I could stand corrected.

Now, I could all be a very wrong newbie, (This is my 1st post) but I am
starting my research here and now and need help and advise and information,
not flames.  Please go easy on me.

I have already driven a 86 944 turbo.  Nice.  Needed a few things.  Few
minor items to be repaired.  Didn't feel comfortable with the driver, yet
extremly knowledgable, 18 year old driver.  :)  AS if you didn't hammer a
car when you were that age.

I need a huge full emcompasing check list of things to know and thing to
look for and most important, a price list/guide as relating condition,
milage, etc...

Thanks in advance for all you'alls help in my new endevour, and, if anyones
got what I want, I have a ultra cream puff of a '62 Austin-Healey MKII
Sprite for trade!  ;0
