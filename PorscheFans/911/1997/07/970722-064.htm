I had an interesting experience at the track this weekend. A three 
day event. After friday (300 miles on the track!) my R1's were toast. 
The left rear had two blisters in the middle of the tire (no, not in 
the groove) through which the cord was visible.  Our circuit is 
clockwise with 14 turns and the left rear takes a beating on a 911.

I discovered this Saturday morning. I had a fresh set of R1's but for 
some reason I couldn't get them on the rim. The fronts refused to 
seat. Those stiff side walls refused to seal.

I was bummed. The yokohama guys were present and seeing my problem 
offered to help. They didn't have any 032R's in my size (big bummer) 
but offered me a street tire instead. It's an AVS S1 which is a Z 
type Y rated (190+ MPH continuous) high performance street tire.

It's seriously cheaper than the Bridgestone S02 and obviously more 
expensive than the R1. The deal was "try it, if you don't like it 
return them after the weekend". I pointed out that after two days on 
our very abrasive track (two days wipes out a set of R1's) the tires 
would be toast. He said it didn't matter.

I was astonished. I abused the heck out of them. They were a little 
squirmy at first but no more thanan S02 which is to say not much. Not 
as crisp as the R1 but as I wore off some tread, they were 
astonishing for a street tire. Grip was almost as good as the R1 and 
I couldn't wear the suckers out.  Again I point out that the track at 
Mt-Tremblant is very abrasive (surface like sandpaper) and almost any 
tires sticks well there, the difference between an R tire and a 
street tire is not all that big. Still, with a 3300 pound C4S driving 
in the instructor group, tires take a beating.

To my surprise, no chunking, feathering or anything else. They look 
like I'd been for a highway cruise. To make a long story short, I 
kept them, laughed when it rained (two very deep rain channels) and 
kept on going.  I've never heard of these tires and they aren't 
listed on the Tire Rack web site. 

For whatever it's worth these things will make me switch from the S02 
for street use and rainy tracks for Driver's ed. Anyone know anything 
about them?

Bob
