John,

I'm not convinced that your problem is electrical.  Although I'm no A/C
expert, I was recently reading about the effect of an improper charge in
the system.  My recollection was that a low charge allowed the gas along
with the liquid coolant to enter the evaporator; you want pure liquid.  The
gas overcools the evaporator which leads to icing which causes the thermo
circuit (?) to shut off the compressor until the evaporator thaws.

You wrote that when the system cuts out, that you have no power going into
the switch.  If my theory is correct, then the wiring circuit must pass
through the thermo circuit before going to the switch.  

To correct the problem, you'll need to charge the system to the correct
level.  Perhaps the new compressor requires a different amount of coolant
than the factory system.  And maybe you can tell by inspecting the sight
glass in the receiver/dryer.

Good luck, let us know what you find,
