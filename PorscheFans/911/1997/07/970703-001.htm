Roger,

Thanks for your reply regarding A/C recharging.

>You stated that you had pressures of 27 psi in your a/c system but this

I think what I was reading was the pressure within the freon canister,
because this was the pressure with the gauges closed and hooked up to a
running compressor (I don't know, it still doesn't make sense).  When I
opened up the low side to let some freon in, the gauge does go up to around
the 75 mark.  If I let it open all of the way I'm sure it would be within
spec.  I had the unit recharged before by a service tech and there was
never any sign of activity concerning the white ball in the receiver/dryer
unit in the left front fender as you describe.  I'm just wondering if it is
faulty or the if the unit has to be running for some appreciable time until
it gets going?  The system did cool well though.

I assume this is with the gauges closed?
