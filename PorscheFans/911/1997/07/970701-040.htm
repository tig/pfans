Your brakes are a closed hydraulic system which operates on the premise
that brake fluid is virtually incompressible. Thus, when you press the
brake pedal the attached master cylinder piston pushes on the trapped
brake fluid which in turn moves the brake pistons. However, if air gets
into this system, things don't work as well because air compresses.
Thus, you braking effort becomes non-linear because you must first
compress the air bubbles in the lines before sufficient hydraulic
pressure can be applied to the caliper pistons.

Bleeding the brakes is a process of flushing the fluid out at the
calipers so as to remove any trapped air. The most common method
requires that one person press the brake pedal while another opens the
bleed nipple on a caliper. The nipple is then closed when the pedal
reaches the floor and the process is repeated until no air bubbles can
be observed coming out of the nipple. This needs to be done for all four
calipers, starting with the one farthest from the master cylinder. The
first enhancement to the process is to use a length of hose over the
nipple going into a clear jar so you can more readily see the bubbles or
lack thereof. This also makes for a much tidier procedure. Otherwise,
you end up with brake fluid on the suspension and the floor. CAUTION:
you don't want to get brake fluid on your car's paint; it can discolor
the paint. The next enhancement is to use a pressure or vacuum bleeding
accessory. I use a pressure bleeder.

Another reason to bleed the brakes is to get rid of the water that
dissolves in the brake fluid. Non-silicone brake fluid is hydroscopic,
which means it will absorb water vapor out of the air. Water in the
fluid is bad for two reasons. First, it can rust steel brake components
like pistons and lines. Second, when heated it will boil and turn into
steam. Steam bubbles in brake lines have the same affect as air bubbles
and are the cause of brake fade (not to be confused with brain fade). I
make it a habit to bleed my brakes before attending track events for
this reason. Racers will bleed their brakes between every session.

There you have it in a nutshell! (well, OK, this is an email message not
a nutshell)
