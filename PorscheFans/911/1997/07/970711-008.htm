Paul,

911's can easily tow a trailer. I've towed over 500 kg for years. Spec's
given to me by a list member in Germany are 600 kg, no brakes, 1200 kg with
brakes. 

A hitch can be fabricated by any competent welder, especially one
experienced in hitches. I started with a pre-fab unit with a detachable
tongue - just make sure the main support tube is wide enough. Wide enough
for what you ask - good question. Under the car , right on the main frame,
is an area for tow hook/ hold down straps to mount. Make a bracket that
bolts here and goes to the rear of the car. 

Cut you bought hitch to fit between these brackets and weld. To keep the
hitch from rotating downwards there are two basic options. 

One is to use U-bolts attached to the bumper shock tubes. 

The other is a little more difficult to explain, but here it goes... The
hole for the hold downs on the body are sort of egg shaped. Cut a piece of 
steel plate ( 1/4" I think ) in this shape. Weld this to the plates you
made to fasten to the frame. Drill a 1/2" hole through the middle. Now cut
another 1/4" piece of plate large enough to cover the egg shaped hole with
a 1/2" hole in it as well. Now sandwich it all together with a 1/2" grade 8
bolt. The egg shaped insert will prevent the hitch from rotating. This
really does work great and makes for a two bolt / ten minute installation.

Hope this helps.
