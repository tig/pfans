Thanks to everybody that responded to my odourous A/C problems. I have a long weekend 
comming up and will try out the recomendations starting with those of the least degree 
of difficulty and moving on up.

The 911 has recirculating air only for the A/C - the air intake in under the
passenger's floorboard (it really is a board!), which comes out for access
quite easily.

I've looked at the floorboard on my car it is held in place by three screws. 2 are easy 
to get at but the third is under the gas pedal. Is there an easy wasy of getting to that 
screw behind the pedal? I do remember seeing a mechanic a while back just reach under 
the pedal move something and the pedal just flopped forward. What it was I have no idea.
