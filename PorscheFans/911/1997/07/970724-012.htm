Assuming you're talking about an '80-'83 911SC, here's a fews thoughts:

Before buying, take it to a Porsche mechanic you trust for a thorough
pre-purchase inspection, including a compression and leakdown test. Offer
to split the cost with the owner, if you buy the car. (If you don't buy it,
you'll pay the whole shot.) If the owner balks, walk away, smoothly and
quickly. If you're new to the marque, call the nearest dealer and ask them
fro names of reputable independent servcie shops in the area, or use the
dealer. (You can also find out through the local chapter of Porsche Club of
America, which the dealer should know how to contact.)

The clutches on early '80s cars are most suspect. Many were supplied with a
clutch with a rubber center "donut" intended as a shock absorber. The donut
rubber gets old and breaks....... goodbye clutch. Earlier fuel injection
models (pre-'82) had atendency to backfire occasionally, which would
rupture the air cleaner "box", a $200 repair for one belch. There's a $15
pop-off valve that can be installed to guard against this. Also, the pedal
cluster bushings, made of Delrin plastic, tend to swell and bind over time.
Check this area carefully in the inspection  stage.

Damage: Even though the lower body panels were galvanized, rust is always a
factor to watch for. Make sure there is no visible rust or any breaks/chips
in the paint inside the front fenders or along the lower rocker panels.

One way to check for repaired body damage is to stand at the front or rear
and sight along the body side from directly behind or in front. Look for
wavy panels, and joints that don't quite match. Check the amount of space
between the door edges and the body; it should be the same all the way
around. Another way is to bring a small magnet and touch it to the body at
likely damage points. If it ddoesn't stick, you're touching bondo, not steel.

Modifications: Purists will tell you that any non-factory modification is
bad, but hey, we buy these toys to express our individuality, right? Even
the guys that stuff small-block Chevy engines into 911 chassis have their
reasons.

Generally, modifications should be documented as to what was done, and by
whom. That gives you a way to get opinions from others (like PCA people) as
to the quality. Common 911 mods include adjustable Koni shocks and larger
anti-sway bars (good), lowering the car (OK if done correctly and proper
alignment is maintained; watch out for excess ball joint wear), and
installing "whale tail" rear spoilers (good, but make sure the matching
front "chin" spoiler is also installed. It's a black rubber piece about 3"
deep.) Anything involving wiring should be done cleanly, with no
connections and loose wires showing.

Maintenance: Plan on spending around $1,500 or so immediately after you buy
the car. Don't ask on what, it just seems that's what it costs to fix
whatever is found on the pre-purchase inspection. Then, assuming 8,000
miles annually (and only one or two drivers ed events) figure on one major
tune-up (including valve adjustment), two oil changes, and maybe one other,
minor visit to the mechanic for...... whatever. I've driven 911s and 944s
for twenty years, and the average annual maintenance bill has run about
$800 or so. I must note that I do a fair maount of drivers ed work (I'm an
instructor driver), so I'm more particular about wanting to ensure that all
the pieces are going to go in the same direction when I want them to (at
120+ MPH).

Good luck! The later 911SC Porsches are the best of that group, and the 3.2
Carrera models (1984-1989) moved the breed ahead even more.

Sincerely,
Tom Thompson
