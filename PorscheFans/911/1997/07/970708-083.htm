Nill,

I have the 80/100 bulbs in my car. The wiring is up to the increased
current, however the hi/low beam stalk switch may not be. The safest thing
would be to interpose a relay.

The low beam improvement is remarkable. In fact, I have aimed my lights so
that low beam gives the best pattern without bothering oncoming drivers. If
I switch to high beam, I can hunt for squirrel nests in the trees, but it
doesn't improve down the road visibility. I experimented with a number of
aiming points, and to get the high beams on the road ahead, they still
blind oncoming drivers while the low beams become useful only for hunting
for lost contact lenses immediately in front of your car.

The ultimate solution is independently aimed high and low beams. These
would be H1 lights, I think, but I don't know if they are available to
replace the H5 units in your car and mine
