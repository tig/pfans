Yup, seems like it's happened again.

I missed about 3 days.

I have to say that while this is an EXTREMELY valuable resource and
I'm sure the admins are doing everything in their power to keep it
up, I think the quality of the software being used leaves something
to be desired....

Jim had mentioned a while ago that he was shopping for new list software...
Hope this happens soon!
