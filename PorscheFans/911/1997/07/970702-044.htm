Michael,
I can understand your question and problem.  I too was looking at 911s a
short time ago ('87-'89) and came across a few cars which were almost
suspiciously nice.  The first car I looked at was an '87 coupe with 25,000
miles on it.  It is possible that a Porsche might have only 2,500 per year,
but did it sit for 4 years and get 10,000 in one?  What concerned me more
was that this was the 5th owner and that there were ABSOLUTELY NO STONE
CHIPS AT ALL on the car. (Think about 5 people learning to drive on your
car!)   It was in a pristine garage which might have been cleaned the
morning before I saw the car. The car started and ran well but it was Feb in
Michigan and the owner wouldn't let me take it out in the snow
(understandable).  He was asking $31,000 for the car (a bit high I think).
The owner was an insurance salesman and the two before him were car
salesmen; there were only a few maintenance papers (but how much maintenance
is needed in 25,000?).  I walked away from this car; didn't even try to get
him down.  

When later I was looking at an '87 targa with 52,000miles, documents
complete, new oil lines and upgraded clutch a friend described it as an
"honest" car.  I made an offer (didn't get it).  I still think that first
coupe I walked away from was less than honest, but I think I'll never know
for sure.  I later found and bought another honest car, I don't think much
about that first one I looked at.
