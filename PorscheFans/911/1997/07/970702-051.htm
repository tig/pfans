I know this has got to be one of the most-repeated subjects around,
but...
The PO of my '88 Targa was an old Corvette guy and he ran Goodyear
Eagle GS-C Z-rated tires (205/55-16 front, 225/50-16 rear).  I'm
getting close to replacing the rears, and want to find the
best-handling street tire I can.  This car is for entertainment only,
so ride harshness, noise, and wet handling are not my concerns.  Tire
wear is a consideration, but I want great dry handling, on the street
only, more than anything else.  The tires I see mentioned here
include:

Yoko A008P
CompT/A ZR
Toyo Proxes F1S n-o
Pirelli P-Zero
Dunlop SP8000

1.  Which tire would you buy, given that dry handling is most
important? (Feel free to add tires I missed)

2.  Am I asking for trouble if I get new (non-Goodyear) rears and keep
the Goodyear fronts for a few thousand miles?  Should I bite the
bullet and replace all four at a time?

3. What kind of wear can I expect out of the tires?
4. If you have experience with the Goodyear GS-C tires, how do the
above compare to them in terms of handling, ride, and wear?

Any thoughts appreciated,
