To continue the caliper thread:


1/  Walt Frike wrote:

b) The other style is
one piece, with some sort of reinforcing ring molded into the base of the
boot.  When it is forced down it holds itself in place.  These are
aggravation personified, at least for me.  Press down on one side, the
other goes up.  Use of tools, more force, etc. usually leads to damaging it
before it has even been installed.  Maybe somewhere there is a tool
which allows even (and pretty strong) pressure to be applied all around
its circumference?

How can I insure that the caliper repair kits I order are always the first
kind, and not the second?  Or does the second kind give superior
service, not burn through at the creases, and I just need some special
tool?

Walt : I believe the second type is commonly called a 'scrapper ring'. It
is used in racing applications and will not be ruined by the heat like the
rubber bellows. It does require more care when used on the street however
because the piston is exposed. Installation is easy if calipers taken
apart, see #4 below

2/ There seems to be some resistance to my suggestion of using a grease gun
to remove the pistons. I suggest you try it before you knock it. To see the
piston come out in 1/8" increments rather than slam out with 120 psi force
shows the benefit. Using you own brake system will also work but you run
the risk of getting air in your brake system. As to the problem of cleaning
out the grease, if you don't clean the calipers well enough to get the
grease out then you didn't clean them well enough anyway. The grease
doesn't adhere well to the fluid covered parts ( all of them ) and most of
it comes out in big clumps.

3/ Brake assembly paste is recommended by most manufactures so I defer to
them on why it's better than brake fluid. This stuff is not a generic
'rubber lubricant' but a purpose made compound for assembly.

4/ As far as taking the caliper halves apart I concede that it shouldn't be
done on a regular basis if the seals are not available. My mechanic told me
that some seals are the same as a common VW part - I will get this info and
pass it on. However if there is any corrosion or mild pitting it is the
only proper way to clean it up ( by honing the cylinders ). My mechanic has
been doing this for years and has not had any problems - just be careful !
