The story I have is a bit different.  There were not only instructors behind
the car, but there was one in the car.  As the driver entered the turn, he
was going fast but believed that all was under adequate control.  The 
instructor (remember, BMW club, not necessarily experienced with the 
power or stick possible with a 911TT; also, California's BMW club has 
been refocusing their track events to less speed and has dropped some
excellent instructors who drive both Porsche's and BMWs) decided that 
it was not possible to make the corner, and grabbed the wheel to force 
the car cleanly off the track.  This (greatly!) surprised the driver who 
responded, almost involuntarily, by hitting the brakes as he left the course.
