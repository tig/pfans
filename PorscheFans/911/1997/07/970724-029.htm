Your friend don't have to go Washington to buy a Boxster. I believe 
there are a few Boxsters in the well known Porsche dealership around the 
SF Bay Area. 

You can check with:

Stevens Creek Porsche+Audi+VW
3350 Stevens Creek Blvd, San Jose, CA 95117
(408)244-5400

Carlsen Porsche
1730 East Embarcardero Road, Palo Alto, CA
(415)856-6300

If you like I can drive it down to SD for you. :^)
