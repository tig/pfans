Tom,
 Though I'm sure someone is just waiting to "fall down laughing" and say that

this is a "stupid" idea [perhaps the _real_ reason myself and others are 
reluctant to post answers to the list] I'll stick my neck out and cc the
list.
  My guess is the that one or both front torsion bars are rubbing inside 
the their A-arms. If you are heavy, have a heavy friend or a friend with
rythm 
you can sit on or push down on a front fender and bounce it up and down
enough 
to reproduce the symptom. The rythm part is necessary if one person isn't 
heavy enough to bounce it alone. <g>
 I had this problem after I changed my torsion bars. I still had this
problem after changed the front torsion bar bushings.  There is a cure for 
this malady though. It tried and it works.  If I say anything more Greg Brown

will kill me. (See the archives for July 31 or Aug 1, search for "Re: 911
front 
suspension bushings")
