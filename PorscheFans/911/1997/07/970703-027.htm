Let me see if I get this straight . . . you're on the track and wonder what
the
best braking technique is . . . 

Hmmmm . . .  if you're on the track, then the object is to get around as
fast
as possible.   That means staying on the gas as long as possible, and on
the
brakes as little as possible.    

An old saying comes to mind:   Flat out until you see God, count to three,
then
brake.   

Most other techniques have nothing to do with maximizing speed.
________________________________________________
	Dave:

	Nothing personal, but I don't agree that it's that simple.  Virtually
every "newbie" who gets on the track (not that I'm saying you are one - I
have no idea) subscribes to this philosophy, and winds up seriously
affecting their ability to learn the track, progress and lap times.

	It's axiomatic in racing that speed coming out of a turn is more
important than speed coming in, particularly on turns before the longest
straights.  That's because the speed you have coming out of the turn is
the speed you will carry all the way down the straight.  On the other
hand, the speed you gain by braking late you will have for all of a few
hundred feet or less.  Therefore, it's much more advisable to brake a bit
earlier going into the turn to make sure that your car is well under control,
so you can get on the gas as early as possible in the turn and be at full
throttle at or slightly past the apex.  I see students again and again trying
to pick up that extra little bit by braking late into a turn, get the car all
squirrelly, and lose seconds down the next straight because they lost 5
mph or more on the exit speed.

	On the other hand, if you are a very experienced driver,
obviously you are going to want to pick up every tenth, and it becomes
improtant to brake later, even trail brake into the entry of the turn where
appropriate.  But my guess is that over 95% of the people on this list fall
into the "not particularly experienced at race driving" category, so I think
my advice in the previous paragraph is much more generally applicable.

	As usual, just MNSHO.
