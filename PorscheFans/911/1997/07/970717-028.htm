Terry,
   Before you buy new injectors you should pull out each bank put each 3 in
a jar in two groups , turn your ignition on then press the airflow activater
and watch the spray pattern one at a time. Be sure to keep all 6 in the jars
because they will all spray all the time this should tell you whether you
need new injectors or not by the spray pattern . Most hard to solve problems
I've encountered usually turn out to be the metering head. Good Luck.
