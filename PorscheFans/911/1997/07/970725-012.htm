Greetings - 

My 911 has approx. 57,000 miles.  After the autox last Sunday, it developed
the annoying habit of sporadically cutting out at above roughly 3,000 rpm in
1st; and 3,500 in 2nd and 3rd gear.  Its almost as if the engine was turned
off for an instant - then it lurches forward as it catches.

I thought it might be a fuel filter problem; mechanic thought it was
electrical.  He checked out his theory and found no noticeable problem but
suggested that I acquire upgrades to the spark plug wires.

Also this summer, the oil temp has been consistently hotter than in previous
years.  In track events, it has reached between the 3/4 mark and the red zone
before I cooled it off.  Mechanic says that the temp between the incoming
hose and outgoing hose from the cooler isn't significantly different,
suggesting that it be flushed.  Any thoughts?

Any theories out there?  Are "hot wires", or some similar upgrade of spark
plug wires worth the investment?  Any different read on the oil temp issue?
 Thanks for the input.
