My '87 color chart doesn't have Prussian Blue.  It has Dark Blue, which is
a very dark, almost black, non-metallic blue, Marine Blue metallic, which
is almost as dark but, of course, metallic (I think this is maybe the one
that goes a little purple in some light - gorgeous with a tan leather
interior), and Venetian Blue metallic, which I would describe as a medium
tone grayish blue.  Oh yes, there's also Diamond Blue metallic, which is
much lighter and really comes off as more of a silver, and was the color
used on some of the anniversary special edition cars.

BTW, I got this original color chart from vintage literature specialist
Walter Miller, who advertises in the back of Excellence.
