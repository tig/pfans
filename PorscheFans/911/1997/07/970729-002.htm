This may be the companion to the A/C Stench question. Does the
recirculation switch somehow close the condenser drains? Last weekend I
took our newly acquired C2 for it's first long summer drive. About 3
hours into the trip we entered some long tunnels so I put the AC into
recirculation mode and forgot about it. A half hour later whenever I
punched it to pass slow traffic I got a refreshing gush of ice cold
water on my throttle foot (as if the car was echoing my wife's
admonition to "cool it.")

After stopping and disabling the recurculation mode(back to normal) I
noticed the car was draining profusely from the forward drains under the
car. 

Could this have been caused by the recirculation mode or was it just a
function of high humidity and three hours on the road?
