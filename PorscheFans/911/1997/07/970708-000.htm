Guys

for those who have been following the speedometer tragedy, the mistery has
finally been solved!
As you may recall, the speed sensor replacement did NOT solve the failing
speedometer.
As I had noted a few weeks ago, the failure of the speedometer seemed to
have coincided with the advent of the "hot" (100 & up) weather.
When my local wrench took some rather "angled" looks at my speedo, I
thought the heat had finally
gotten to him! Then, to top it off, he pulls out a large black suction cup
and slams it on to the face of
my speedo, immediately pulling on it real hard!!!! (no, he was not trying
to pull it out and kill it).

Finally, he explained his actions. He told me that the heat must have
caused the "plastic" speedo
glass to expand and concave inwards. Subsequently, the plastic "caught" the
needle and prevented 
it from "moving". Interesting, eh? (this guy is good, I tell ya!).

Well, after some "plastic surgery" the speedo now works!

Moral of the story... next time check your plastic (no pun intended) before
you rush out and buy a speed sensor.

Auf wiedersehen,
