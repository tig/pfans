I have several questions regarding the Factory AC on my recently
acquired (Jan. 1997) 1981 911SC Coupe.  At this point the system has
been recharged and serviced by looking for leaks three times.  The 
last time it lasted about three weeks which is twice as long as the 
first two times.  The experienced mechanic has tried dye and a 
sniffer to try to find leaks and can find no more.  His assessment is 
that the OEM York compressor is leaking internally and should be 
replaced.  

What is the likelyhood that a new compressor will fix the problem?

Should I consider converting to R-134a?

Are barrier hoses required for R-134a

What other components are required to convert?

Has anyone had experience with a receiver/dryer rplacement called a 
Pro Cooler?

What brand of replacement compressor is preferred?
