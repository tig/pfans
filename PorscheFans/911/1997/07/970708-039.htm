<<It is tune with high fuel mixture, and I am using 92 octane now. I am

trying to switch to lower rating gas. Is this a good idea?>>

Clemson,
I really wouldn't do that.  My 930 gets pretty poor gas mileage as well, but
man what fun!  I never use any gas in either of my Porsches that isn't 93
octane Shell or Amoco.  I've heard the argument that 92/93 octane fuel is no
better than 87, but I don't believe it.  In my experience higher octane fuel
helps the engine to run cleaner and more efficiently, it improves fuel
economy, and it does make more horsepower as well as eliminating spark-knock.
 If there wasn't something superior about it then race teams would use 87
octane gas.  Pay the extra $.10 per gallon, if nothing else than for peace of
mind.  My 928 even has a sticker in the engine compartment and on the dash to
use nothing but high octane Shell products, and I doubt that Porsche owns any
piece of the Shell Corp.  There's even a doctor here in town who regularly
puts 7 or 8 gallons of 103 octane racing fuel in his two 930's and Testarossa
before filling the rest of the tanks up with 93 octane.  It surely doesn't
hurt anything but your pocket book.  Don't scrimp with your Porsche.
