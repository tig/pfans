Thanks to many replies and some hours on the 74 911S, turned out 
the hazard switch was loose and a connector under the dash was 
disconnected causing intermittent problems with the entire 
lighting system.  Taught us a thing or two !

Now the next project is clear: get the puppy under 200 degrees.
Where exactly is the bloody oil cooler ?  
The Haynes shop manual (sic) says there's a 2 piece cover for the 
cooler and am having difficulties locating it.  Is the oil cooler 
behind the air-filter unit towards the rear passenger seat or what ?  
Do I need to disconnect the air-filter unit, the fuel injection 
system, etc. ? Also have this oil cooler condensor thing under the 
front hood but where is this supposed to connect ?  Does anyone 
have a microfiche drawing to FAX me ?  
Any textual step by step instructions will help !

Thanks,
