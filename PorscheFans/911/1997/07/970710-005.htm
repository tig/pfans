my wife, who is a recognized leader in the field of destructive testing,
broke the targa latch on our 77.  the pin sheared on the handle, which was
the easy fix, but the "barrel" that the handle plugs into split, down at the
base of the barrel.  after finding a replacement latch mech was $275 (per
side), i had to find a quick fix.

a spring-type hose clamp fit, very tightly, around the barrel, compressing it
back to it's original shape, and allowing rotation.  this works just fine!!
 took 10 minutes to repair, and i am awaiting her next "experiment".

i believe the root cause of the busted latch was either weatherstrip that
sits too high in the windshield channel, or she forced the handle in the
wrong direction?
