Alan,

	It has been a while since I changed the clutch cable on an SC but
frm what I can remember it is relatively easy. First step is to diconnect
the linkage from the clutch under the trans. This is self explanatory and
will require two 17mm wrenches to loosen the locking nuts. Loosen the nuts
all the way and undo the linkage from the t/o fork. The next step is to
remove your center console and caarpet from the drivers footwell and
center tunnel. When you look in the access hole in the tunnel you can see
the end of the clutch cable which has a clevis fork and locking pin. You
will need to remove this pin...this is more difficult than it sounds so
examine it closely first. Then loosen the locking nut to the clevis fork,
an 8mm I believe, and unscrew the clevis fork from the clutch cable. At
this point the cable can be pulled through the tunnel from underneath the
car by the fire wall. The new cable can be fitted in the reverse order. A
solid tube through the center tunnel allows you to simply slide the new
cable into place. I would also recommend lubricating the new cable
before sliding it into the tunnel. Also, examine the arm that runs through
the pedal cluster which the clevis pin attatches to for wear...Have you
rebuilt your pedal assembly yet???

Don't you love these cars, they are a never ending project. Good luck!
