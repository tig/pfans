Well, since Harley didn't rise to the bait...

I don't completely understand it either, although there are a number of
considerations.  A Targa is not as rigid as a coupe, and it's not as open
as a cab.  I think it's seen as a "compromise" by many, which of course is
exactly what it is.  But that's not necessarily bad.

Yes, but so apparently do cabs'...

>Is the car less solid with a T top ?  

Yes, as compared to a coupe.  With the top on I get a fair amount of
rattles and groans.  WIth the top off I don't notice it at all, but it's
said to be noticeably less stiff for track purposes.

>Other problems ?  

The top wears out after a while, and has to be recovered.

The shape of the Targa doesn't hang together as well as the coupe, and I
guess in any color other than black it's got "too many notes".  In black or
dark gray it looks great, though (IMHO, cognitive dissonance mode on).
Anyway, I never liked Targas much until I bought one.  I was looking for a
cab, got frustrated, noticed the price diff on Targas, and fell in love
with the first one I looked at.  So far I am very happy with it indeed.
With the top off (which is 90% of the time for me), it's almost exactly
like a cab from the inside; you're really not aware of the rollbar/rear
window except for the view through the mirror and having significantly less
wind buffeting.

Perhaps the most significant advantage of the Targa over the cab is that
you can run PCA track events with it, which you can't do with a cab unless
you install a rollbar.  That advantage perhaps pales in comparison to the
fact that you can probably find an '87-'89 Targa for $6k or so less than a
comparable cab, maybe slightly less than a comparable coupe, but then of
course you'll give that back on resale.

And if you need any further encouragement, note that according to PML,
while '87-'89 coupes and cabs continued to tick down about a per cent in
value last year, Targas ticked *up* a point or so.
