Hi,  
I posted a message regarding the engine temp. and oil pressure of my 74-2.7 on the wkend. Didn't 
see any comments, probably do to the list crash, so here goes again.
I was under the impression that operating temps of 210-220 deg. and slowly dropping oil pressure 
from the 65 area to 20 or below( due, I assume to the oil thinning at higher temps)was relatively 
normal. I have been driving my 74-911 for five years and get it serviced by a porsche shop. I 
queried the mechanic about these conditions when I first bought the car and was given the 
impression that this was how the motor operated.After scanning the list last week I'm not so sure 
that these conditions are normal. The engine seems to operate smoothly and much to my satisfaction  
but now Im concerned that I may be doing damage.
feedback would be most welcome.

Thanks
John
