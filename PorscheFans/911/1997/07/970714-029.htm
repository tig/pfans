PORSCHING  by Chris Welty

Romantic Excursions

Many people believe that the relationship between a Porsche and its
owner is entirely monogamous, and that spouses, or anyone
approximating this state, can tend to get in the way.  This is
actually not true, and there are many truly romantic and exciting
things two people can do together with their Porsche. 

The first step in realizing this goal is understanding what
romanticism really is.  There are many definitions of the word, but
human language is such that a dictionary definition is not always the
right path toward meaning.  Each person has their own idea of what
romantic is, and these ideas are frequently quite different.  My wife,
for example, thinks moonlight walks on the beach are romantic.  Such
an excursion would not be very romantic for me, since I would spend
the whole time glancing anxiously back at the parking lot to see if
anyone was trying to break into my 911. 

Romantic notions are typically not subject to compromise, either.  You
might think, for example, that my problems with the moonlit walk on
the beach could be alleviated by turning it into a moonlit drive on
the beach. I, however, would be too anxious that the salt water might
get on the car and rust out the floor pan, and of course I'd have to
spend the whole next day washing all the damn sand out of every nook
and cranny.  Sand is such a pain in the neck. 

Does this mean that *I* am not romantic?  Not at all, not at all.  I'm
considered by many to be a hopeless romantic, it's just that my notion
of romance is different than that typically found in Danielle Steele
or Jane Austin novels.  For me, one of the most romantic activities a
couple can share together with their Porsche is bleeding the brakes. 

Brake bleeding has long been a favorite activity for active couples
who don't mind getting a little dirty together.  I have an
acquaintance who claims his wife's wedding vows included, "love,
cherish, and pump the brake pedal," and I know several people who
claim they got married just to be sure there'd be someone around to
help bleed the brakes.   That, however, is a common mistake. 

While brake bleeding is a very intimate activity, you can not take it
for granted.  When I was dating, I was always very careful in
approaching my dates on the subject of brake bleeding.  I found that
expecting someone to come home with me and pump the pedal on the first
date was frequently unrealistic, even after an expensive dinner and a
Broadway Show.   I would often go to great lengths impressing someone
just to get them into my garage, and when there I paid extra attention
to safety and cleanliness. 

Once I was married, I soon began to expect my wife to help me bleed my
brakes whenever I desired.  No expensive dinners, no Broadway shows,
no great lengths.  In fact, before long I would come home from work
expecting to have dinner ready and waiting for me, with a good
bleeding session to follow.  I would try to explain how important it
was for a car to have frequent brake bleedings, and that you couldn't
let them go too long without it - especially track cars.  At this
point I cared less for safety and cleanliness, spilling brake fluid
all over the floor and sometimes leaving the car teetering on a couple
jacks. 

Eventually this casual and callous attitude began to take its toll.
My cars would often go months with contaminated brake fluid, and the
topic of bleeding became a sore one at home.  I would stand in the
kitchen, silently staring at my wife not wanting to ask, and she would
pretend like she didn't know why I was standing there.   

What almost destroyed my marriage was the "EZ Bleed" (TM) system.  I
think it was Kevin Gross who turned me on to this, back in the days
when the Porsche EMail discussion list had fewer than a hundred people
on it and we hadn't had every discussion more than twice yet (so I was
still actually reading it).  I don't blame him, his intentions were
good.  This system, much like the hand-pump vacuum bleeder, enables
one person to bleed the brakes fairly easily.  I was soon bleeding my
brakes more than I ever had before. 

My wife became suspicious.  I no longer asked her to help me, and I
never stood around like a hungry dog hoping she would spontaneously
decide she was in the brake bleeding mood.  She was sure I had rented
out a garage somewhere and had found someone else.  I didn't care,
since all my cars had firm brake pedals. 

Before long, though, I began to recall wistfully the days of saying to
my wife, "Pump.  Hold.  OK, again..." ad infinitum.   I started to
think how much I had changed since my younger days, and I realized
that I had lost something.  Bleeding brakes is not just about flushing
old fluid from the brake system, it is about sharing quality time
together.  I was certainly not being very romantic anymore. 

In a tender and emotional scene my wife and I reconciled, and we bled
the brakes on all our cars in one evening.   It was so romantic that I
rebuilt my master brake cylinder the next morning so we could bleed
the system again that night. 

Romance and Porsches doesn't stop with brake bleeding.  It's far less
frequent, but adjusting the clutch cable length is a lot of fun, as is
setting the hand brake, and who could forget those wonderful times
push-starting the car when the solenoid got too hot... 

"What's wrong?"

"It's too hot.  I should have parked on a hill."  Sigh.  "OK, I'll get
out and push.  You keep it in first and let the clutch out once I get
it rolling." 

"OK."

"Ready?   Here goes..." Grunt.  "AAAAARgh.  You're letting the clutch
out TOO SOON!" 

"sor-RY."

"You want to push?"

"Couldn't we have taken the Honda?"

"WHAT?!  Grrrrrrr....As soon as I get this knife out of my back I want
you to try second - and wait until it's rolling." 

"OK."

"...LET IT OUT ALREADY!"

There are other things you can do, like taking a spring or fall drive.
Or summer.  I don't do winter drives in the Porsche anymore, but we
used to.  Getting too old, I guess.  That is, the Porsches are getting
too old. 

I find, while driving in the U.S. where the highway speed limit is
about the speed most people WALK, that I have trouble paying attention
or even staying awake sometimes.  Driving slow requires so little
mental processing that I will shift my attention onto other things
very often.  This means that when I'm driving either the car is
wandering out of my lane or going fast enough that I have to pay
attention, which brings me to another romantic thing my wife and I
share in our Porsche. 

"Slow down."

"I'm not going that fast."

"100 miles per hour is very fast."

"You don't understand, I'm well below the performance limit of this
car.  Why, at Bridgehampton..." 

"You are well ABOVE the speed limit of this state, not to mention the
mandatory speed for license revocation." 

"Thank you dear."

"... Wake up."

"I'm not sleeping."

"You're not in your lane, either."

"Oh, errr ... I just wanted to see if the road was smoother here."

"Well now we've established that unpaved surfaces are not as smooth as
paved.  Maybe we should return to our lane." 

"Thank you dear."

I hear that some couples even drive at the track together!  At first I
thought this was only the kind of thing you read about in the Panorama
"Forum" section, where no one believes the stuff they write about
there really happens, but it's true.  I've seen it, and it's happening
more and more these days.  We may even try it soon. 

All in all, a Porsche itself can facilitate romance in many ways.  I
suggest that you get out there and be romantic.
