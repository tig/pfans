Chris Brennan writes with many questions about his 85 911 Carrera 
Sunroof Coupe.  I can more-or-less answer one of them.

Gotta define the difference between 'standard' and 'stock'.  The standard
wheel for '86, and I think for '85, was 6x15 (front) and 7x15 (rear) cookie
cutters.  Essentially no cars were imported into the US in this configuration.
There were two optional packages.  6x16 front with 7x16 rear Fuchs alloys,
and 7x15 front with 8x15 rear Fuchs alloys.  Both packages would be 
considered 'stock', but not standard equipment.  The 16" option was the 
most common, being fitted on something like 85% of the cars, and were the
nearly automatic dealer checkoff on specifying cars they wanted.  The
balance of the cars got the 15" Fuchs alloys.  In '87, apparently in response
to a factory glut of the 15" Fuchs alloys, the 7/8 combination became the
standard wheel configuration.

I presume the cookie cutters you have are 15".
