It may be a long shot, but these are my questions:

EASY:
   Does anyone know the weight of the '91 3.6 engine, complete, 
without transmission?

VAGUE:
   Should the top of the air flow meter (I think that is what it is -
silver, 4 pin plug, right before rubber boot and butterfly) be parallel
with the ground, or what looks like mounted flat? I ask because mine
sits at an angle and appears to be mounted correctly (approx 30
degrees), but I've seen pictures where they look dead flat, and cannot
see how it could be installed like that.

RANDOM:
   There are two terminals on the oil pressure sensor. The only marking
appears to be a blue dot by one. Two green wires with different colored 
stripes attach to this sensor for the guage and ??? (I think one of 
these wires is green with a black stripe). Which wire goes to which 
terminal? I know, I know, I disassembled this too quickly.
