     A former California resident suggests this route as an alternate to 
     the Vista del Mar route which should get the adrenaline pumping.
     
     An alternate route:
     Turn east on El Toro road from the San Diego Freeway.
     Drive straight to the intersection of Rancho Santiago and El Toro. At the 
     green light start the watch.
     The road goes uphill to a sweeping left hand turn for about 3/4 mile.
     After the turn the road widens for 1 1/2 to 2 miles for a straight 
     uphill to the ridge.  The ridge runs left, right, right, left and then 
     kinks right where the Santiago Canyon road leads off to the right.  Go 
     flat out through these turns.  The kink has a gravel or dirt company 
     that brings trucks out onto the road.  They will time their turns so 
     that you can pass them in the left turn lane for the oncoming traffic 
     at Santiago Canyon, if you dare.   After the truck entrance the road 
     has a series of Esses that lead to a third lane for passing.  The end 
     of the passing lane leads into a canyon and  crosses a creek.  Do not 
     pinch any left-hand turns or you will hit oncoming cars from the east 
     who are tight up against the inside of the hill.  Once you pass this 
     section the road goes through a meadow with Irvine lake on the right.  
     Go fast but watch for cars with trailers pulling into the lake during 
     full moons. After this series there will be another passing lane for 
     you up a long hill.  At the crest of the hill the road turns downhill 
     with a passing lane.  Several jurisdictions can patrol the downhill 
     slope and set speed traps.  Be especially careful of the fire station 
     at the crest of the hill on the left. At the bottom of the hill is a 
     light.   Stop the watch.  This trip is 11 miles and a good run is 13 
     minutes.
