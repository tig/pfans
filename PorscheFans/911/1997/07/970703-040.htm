Ok, you're probably wondering what A/C and ignition coils have in common.
 The answer is that they shouldn't have anything in common.  Especially the
space they occupy under your rear deck lid.

I brought my 911 to my mechanic yesterday to have the a/c system checked
since it stopped working last year & I decided to have it fixed this year (as
opposed to removing it completely in order to save weight!)  The reason it no
longer works was due to a hole in the rear condensor caused by the ignition
coil being mounted too high in its little bracket and rubbing against it.
 Maybe it slid a bit when I changed the wires last year and put the coil wire
on?

Whatever the case may be, if this happens to you, it'll run you $300 for a
new condensor ($100 from Parts Heaven for a used on) and a few pounds of
freon, and some labor.  So the next time your behind your P-car, you may want
to give a quick check to make sure you don't have the same problem.

I feel kinda stupid for not noticing it myself.  Oh well.
