As I reported last week, I replaced the badly warped leather dash in my
84 Carrera with a boneyard vinyl one (came out great, BTW).

Observation #1:  The new dash improved my AC.  Really.  Evidently, the
leather had shrunk and deformed the dash so much, the AC vents were
pulled a little loose from the plenum that they press fit into. 
Precious cold air was leaking out of the breached plenun/vent seal
behind the dash, as well as causing a pressure drop.

Observation #2:  Unless you know what you are doing and have the proper
tools, spend the $45.00 and have a pro put the winshield back in.  It's
worth it.

Observation #3:  I bought (via mail order) an aftermarket windshield
gasket seal, based solely on price ($45.00).  Don't.  Go to the nearest
Porsche dealership, spend the $60.00, and by the factory one. It is
thicker, beefier, looks better, and is easier to work with.  The cheezy
after market one is going back today;  it was too thin, and a very poor
fit.

Obsevation #4:  I blew the fuse for the dome lights, and went to buy a
replacement.  I did not know this, but BUSS fuses now make normal
replacements for these piece of s#$# ceramic fuses.  The replacements
look just like regular glass enclosed fuses, except that they have
pointy ends, in order to snap into the german fuseholders.  I, for one,
will be upgrading *all* my fuses to glass enclosed types ASAP.
