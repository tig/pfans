I know tire questions have been beat to death but I have a question that =
is
somewhat unique to me. I've been using Yoko AVS tires for quite some time=
=2E
I think they are great tires for what I use them for. I noticed recently
that the Yoko 509 tires are also Z rated for about $100 less per tire. So=

I'm wondering what it is that makes the AVS worth $100 more than a 509. =


I have two cars that eat a set of rear AVS tires every 8000 to 12,000
miles. For the driving I and my wife do, this equals 4 tires a year for t=
he
rear. There are lots of things I could spend $400 on if the tire
performance is not substantially different. =


These cars do not participate in sanctioned speed events, although they d=
o
get exercised frequently on the winding mountain road we live on.

All opinions appreciated.
