I am looking for information on Garrett TS04 ball bearing turbochargers. I 
understand these are the same units being sold by Vision Motorsports as their 
Kokeln units. I also understand these to be similar to the KKK K29 in output? 
I am concerned about installing this unit because of the smoking problems that 
the Garretts exhibit with a 911 Turbo. I understand this is due to the 
capacity of the oil scavage system from the factory. I contacted a 
distributor/mfg of this ball bearing unit and was informed that it requires 
1/3 less oil than the regular units. I wonder if this reduction is enough for 
the stock scavage pump to handle? Has anyone used one of these units on their 
911 turbo or know anyone who has? Any feedback would be appreciated!
