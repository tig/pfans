Terry, 
from my experience your problem likely will reappear because the old foam at
the fire wall will keep disintegating.  The solution is a new  pad. I chose
the Dynamat "Hoodliner" thermodynamic pad which has a reflective aluminum
layer at its rear facing surface (keeps heat away from the interior of the
car). I found that product reduced interior (cab) noise by about 2-3dB in the
100hz region over the stock Porsche replacement. I also installed a different
Dynamat product on the inside (cab side) engine wall, which reduced the noise
another db or two.

As you may remember we left our intrepid CIS trouble shooter with a =
functioning system, no spitting or missing and all seeming well with his =
world after checking and changing out the injectors.  That was until I =
tried out my new found full throttle on a short trip during lunch time.  =
All was well until throttle down which ended with a small backfire in =
the muffler.  Got to where I was going and couldn't restart the car.  It =
acted like it was flooding and when finally started missed and sputtered =
on the way back to my office.  4 hours later I turned on the ignition =
and was greeted to the sound of the injectors spraying.  They stopped =
and after some difficulty I got it started.  Same thing as before, =
missing and sputtering through traffic until I got a little room and =
gave it a quick burst in 1st.  After that all seemed fine again and it =
restarted hot at home without a problem.  Next day I pulled the fuel =
distributor assembly and disassembled it to see what could have caused =
the fuel distributor to stick open.  Found some black residue in the =
throat of the air venturi above the air plate and the same black goo on =
the leading edge to the round plate where it is checked for adjustment.  =
Everything else, pressure regulator seat and fuel distributor piston =
looked fine.  I centered and readjusted the plate and poked around a =
little.  It looks to me like a piece or pieces of the sound insulation =
had fallen into the air box intake the last time the fuel distributor =
was off the car.  At full throttle with good vacuum for the first time =
in I don't know how many years some of it got sucked up and then caused =
the plate to stay open on throttle down.  I checked a piece in gas and =
it does dissolved into the same kind of black goo I found.  I hope this =
is all that there is to it and from now on I'll use a shop vac anytime I =
open up the air cleaner.
