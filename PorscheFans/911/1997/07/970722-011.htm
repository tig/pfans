According to Bruce Anderson's book, the Silver Anniversary edition was an
'89.  The '88 was a special edition to commemorate 250,000 911s built.  The
latter was painted Diamond Blue Metallic with a Silver Blue partial leather
interior and wrinkled leather seat inserts, and matching color wheels.  325
went to the U.S., 250 for Germany, and 325 for RoW.  As for the '89 Silver
Anniversary (which were mostly silver metallic but a few in satin black
metallic), Bruce says 500 were built, but doesn't say how many of those
came to the U.S.  I think Zimmerman's book gives that figure, but I loaned
it to someone at the office.
