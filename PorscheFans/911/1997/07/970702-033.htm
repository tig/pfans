From the user manual that comes from the car I read how to check the oil 
level (car running, warm, level ground) and how many drain plugs there 
were.  I don't think a close up photo of the bottom of the oil tank with a 
plug in it is all that much help, but that is the type of picture all cars 
come with.  I happened to lean under the car from the right rear and there 
it was (oil tank plug), right in my face.  I also read to fill it up with 
10 qts to start with, let the car idle for 30 seconds, then check the level 
and add if necessary.

From the list I learned that the oil comes out fast and that a normal catch 
pan can't catch it fast enough.  We bought (she bought) a 10qt wide mouth 
catch pan.  I had my small mouth 15qt pan ready for backup as well as a new 
roll of paper towels and some shop towels.

The car had been driven at least 10 miles, maybe 15, in the last hour 
before it got to my place.  I put a fan on it for a while to hope it would 
cool.  I didn't want 220 deg F oil running down my arm.

The first thing I like to do is loosen the oil filter.  This way I am sure 
I can get it off for replacement.  I don't believe in oil filter wrenches.  
I was just able to get it off with my hands.

After a little while, when I checked the oil tank drain plug, it wasn't 
that hot.  Hmmm.  Oil/air cooled engines must be strange!  So, why not go 
for it?  It was 10:30pm anyway.  I loosened the oil tank drain plug and 
started to twist it off with my hand.  Felt a little oil trickle and then 
prepared to let 'er rip.  When the plug came out the oil came flying out.  
It didn't just drain fast, but really fast.  The first 8 qts came out in 
probably 15 seconds and the last quart in the next 15 seconds.  (That 
initial rate is a quart every 2 seconds for the math impaired.)  Holy oil 
dump, Batman!  Fortunately, the 10qt catch pan was up to the task and I 
didn't spill more than a drip.  Also, the oil that came out later was hot.  
Almost very hot.

Next was the block drain plug.  This plug was hot.  I had to leave the fan 
on it for another 1/2 hour.  After that time it was not so hot I couldn't 
hold on to it for a few seconds.  I had my large catch pan (with the 
smaller opening) ready for this oil.  I had it right under the drain plug.  
Removed the plug and a good amount of oil came out and shot right over the 
catch pan right onto the drive way.  D'oh!  It almost shot out.  The rest I 
did get into the pan.  Used a few paper towels on this one.  This oil was 
much hotter but, fortunately, only my hand got oily.

Put the plugs back in and removed the oil filter.  I like the "high" filter 
design (high with respect to the engine) where oil doesn't spill all over 
creation when you remove it.  The other cars that I've owned (not that I 
own this one) are all on the bottom and removing the fliter sucks.  Anyway, 
put the new filter on (finger tight) and started adding oil.  Added more 
oil.  Added more.  Grew an inch.  Added more oil.  Put oil in, then, after 
that, added oil.  I stopped at 10qts.  The SO fired it up and we waited at 
least 30 seconds to check the oil level.  The level was just below (maybe 
1/2 cm) the bottom mark on the dip stick.  It says it takes 1.85 qts to go 
from the bottom to the top.  I put 2 qts more in.  Then, we went for a test 
drive.  The in-car oil level gauge pointed off the gauge on the high end.  
I hope I didn't over fill it.  It takes about 13 qts, right?  We drove for 
5 minutes at below 2000 rpms.  Came back, car hot, measured again.  It 
showed just over (1 cm) the top mark.  D'oh!  Since I have no idea how fast 
this car burns oil or how oil level can affect the car, I decided to drain 
some.  Plan 1) remove crank case plug for 0.2 seconds, then put back on.  
But, that sounded like a good way to burn myself and drain 2 qts, not 1/2 
qt.  Plan 2) use hand pump to drain from oil tank.  Good thing I remembered 
that that late at night.

I hand pumped about 3/4 qt out.  Oil was pretty hot.  Checked level again 
and I was about .1 cm above the top mark.  Rats.  We went for another test 
drive below 2000 RPM.  Came back and the level is right at the top mark, 
maybe a smidge over.  Call it even.  I'm sure we'll burn a smidge on our 
525 mile drive today.

Next time:
o remember to put catch pan farther to passenger side for draining crank 
case oil
o fill with 10qts, then let car run for several minutes before checking 
level.
o add oil 1qt at a time, after the initial 10qts.
o change oil in neighbor's driveway!  (Just kidding :-)

Happy wrenching.

PS:  I did get the dip stick back in the dip stick hole.
