I was allegedly clocked doing 67 in a 50 zone, by K-55 radar, by a
Newark, NJ police cruiser on the Pulaski Skyway.

I decided to fight the charge, and I reccomend all of you to do the same
EVERY time it happens to you. I WAS 100% SUCCESSFUL YESTERDAY!!!!!

There are 3 ways for you to avoid getting hit with points by your
insurance co (and by the state if your state also charges you with
points)-- here's how:

1. Plead not guilty and get a court date. If the police officer doesn't
show up and you do-- you can ask the court to dismiss the charge for
lack of prosecution. This routinely works because in most traffic
courts-- there is no prosecutor-- there's just you, the police officer,
and the judge. Without the police officer-- the state has no case! This
is what happened to me yesterday!!!   To slightly increase the chances
of getting a no-show officer situation-- 10 days before your court date,
call in to the court clerk and request an adjournment, stating you will
be out of town on your court date, or that your lawyer will be
unavailible on that day, or whatever. If they grant your request-- good;
If they do not-- don't worry-- just go to court on the original court
date. (You want the adjournment because chances are a little less likely
that the police officer who ticketed you will be properly informed of
this new court date, and he will therefore be a no-show...)

2. If the officer does show up-- you will want to speak to him; here's
how. When your name is called for roll call-- answer that you are
present-- if the officer is also there-- he too will answer--"officer
present" right after you say that you are present. This is your
opportunity to speak to him quietly for a moment. As a matter of fact--
many of the officers took the initiative at this point and THEY called
the defendant out into the hallway for a minute to have a chat. Your
goal is to have the officer ammend the summons to some other offense so
that he still gets credit for the "collar", the city still gets their
fine money, BUT you won't get any points!!!! In NJ, you want to get the
offense ammended to 39:4-215 -- this is 'failure to obey signals, signs,
or directions'. The judge can set the fine as high as your origninal
speeding ticket-- but there are no points for this offense!!!!!  I've
seen this successfully done numerous times. The police officer may even
offer to do this for you before you say word one! And remenber-- if you
show up and the officer does not-- you have already won!!!!

3. This last method is much harder, and you may need an attorney to pull
it off. I was prepared to do it myself-- but I'm a 3rd year law student,
and so it was simple for me to look up the cases I needed to know about.
You need to attack the calibration of the radar, the training of the
officer, and the proper use of the radar. The proof neccesary for this
sort of defense varies from state to state, and so you may need an
attorney on this one! What you are looking for are published cases in
your state where a judge has set the standards of proof neccesary for
the state to prove all aspects of the speeding offense, especially
proper working order and use of the speed reading device that you were
clocked with.

Well-- that's it for now-- I hope this gives some of you the heart to
fight EACH and EVERY speeding ticket you may receive!! Remember-- you
may win simply by showing up!!!

Best regards---- Gregory in NJ (no-- not the one who keeps telling us he
is moving to 				New England)


PS I now have K-40 front and rear undetectable radar built into my 964
cab, AND I also use a Valentine 1. (When I got my speeding ticket last
year-- I was driving my MR2-Turbo, and did not have a radar detector on
at the time (doh!!). The biggest plus of the K-40 is its always on-- you
don't have to first reach into your glove compartment, get your
detector, mount it on the windshield....... its too easy for you to tell
yourself-- "oh--i'm just gonna be on the road for 10 minutes... i don't
need it..."

PPS For those wondering-- how is it a law student is already driving a
serious car--I'm not some young snot-nosed rich kid driving a Porsche
while still in school. This is my third career. I've already made a
couple bucks as a NYC chef and as a medical billing computer
consultant!
