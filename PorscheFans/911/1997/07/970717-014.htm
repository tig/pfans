One thing that could conceivably cause this is bad alternator bearings.
When you hear it scraping, shut off the engine and then attempt to
wiggle the fan pulley side to side and up and down. Movement would tend
to implicate the alternator bearings. You can replace the bearings in
the alternator or exchange the whole thing for a new or rebuilt
alternator.

But then again, since I haven't had this happen to me yet (knock on
wood), it could be something completely different like Martians trying
to mess with your head. ;-)
