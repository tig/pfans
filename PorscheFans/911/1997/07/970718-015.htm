Steve -

On my '87 the dust covers are not completely hemispherical, but have a slightly
narrower "waist".  I used an old 3/8" drive extension and a metal hammer to get
them off.  You can't get much angle on them, but it works.  The rounded end of
the extension allows you to tap pretty firmly without denting the cap.  Just
position the extension at the waist of the cap, angled as far outward as
the hub clearance will allow, and rap on alternate sides.  It was nearly a
"night of 1000 strokes" to get them both off, but as with everything else
on a Porsche, patience pays.

Once you get the covers off, there's an allen screw locking the main nut.
Adjustment is obvious, and you'll finally find out why the hub has that
angled groove cut into it!

If you've ever had brake boiling problems and wanted to remove the front
dust shrouds, this is a good time to do it.  Remove the main nut, carefully
remove the rotor (bearings come with it, and DON'T get any grease on it!!).
This exposes two or three bolts on the dust shroud.

Hope this helps,

- Brad
