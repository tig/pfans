    Superior to the behavior of the other Goodyear Eagles or any of
    the other manufacturers' high-performance tires?  Yes.

    Hard to know for sure... Firestone makes a similar tire, and
    Goodyear has an "AquaTred II" that's alleged to perform even
    better than the original AquaTred, but I think the differences
    AMONG the rain tires are smaller than the difference between all
    of them and the tires not specifically designed for rain.

> 3) Is the behaviour good on dry roads (e.g. fast cornering)?

    Not particularly... As with most things, tires that are
    optimized for one set of conditions usually compromise others.

    Personally, I like Yokohama AVS Intermediates on my P-Car; I
    think they're a good compromise.  They don't offer the BEST dry
    grip, and they don't have anywhere NEAR the AquaTred's resistance
    to hydroplaning, but the dry-weather performance isn't terrible
    and they're manageable in the rain if I drive intelligently.

    On the other hand, the really EXCELLENT dry-weather tires (like
    Yoko A008s, BFG R1s, or the stock Yoko A022Hs on my other car)
    can be terrifying in standing water, at almost any speed.
