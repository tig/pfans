Last evening I was replacing the hood struts on my 88 coupe (Wow! 
that left side bottom pin is fiddley to get in) when I noticed a pipe 
that was not connected to anything but looked like it should.

The free end of the pipe was discovered lurking near the master brake 
cylinder.  It is about 1/4" o.d. 1/8" i.d. and is of dark grey 
braided cotton over rubber. It was connected to something once cos 
it still has a black cable tie round the end.

The pipe runs from the area of the master cylinder across the 
bulkhead to the left wing where it does a 90 degree turn and runs 
down the wing.  Just before the fuse box (in fact just above the 
windshield washer bottle) it connects in line to a white/clear 
plastic pipe where it continues toward the left headlamp. It then 
dives through a grommet in the side of the wing near the front of 
the battery. I cannot see from under the car where it goes, at first 
I thought it was the headlamp washers but it's not.

I sure would be grateful if anybody can tell me what this pipe is or 
where the free end should connect to.
