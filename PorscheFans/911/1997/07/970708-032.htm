<<Yoko A008P- Yokos are very sticky but wear very quickly as well.  Very good
tires.

CompT/A ZR- don't like Michelin tires at all.

Toyo Proxes F1S n-o- good tires, but they are cheap for a reason.  Fairly
sticky.

Pirelli P-Zero- probably one of the best tires you can buy, but they are
expensive.

Dunlop SP8000- Very good tires as well.  I used to only use Goodyears and
now have switched to only using Dunlop.  Just put a set of 8000's on my 930.
 



<<1.  Which tire would you buy, given that dry handling is most

important? (Feel free to add tires I missed)>>
Would highly recommend either Dunlop 8000/9000's, P-Zeros or Bridgestone
S-O2's.



<<2.  Am I asking for trouble if I get new (non-Goodyear) rears and keep

the Goodyear fronts for a few thousand miles?  Should I bite the

bullet and replace all four at a time?>>
Probably not, but it is nice to have an all new set of tires.



<<3. What kind of wear can I expect out of the tires?>>

Depending on your driving I'd say from between 12 & 15,000 miles.  It's been
my experience that Dunlops wear especially well. 

<<4. If you have experience with the Goodyear GS-C tires, how do the

above compare to them in terms of handling, ride, and wear?>>
Don't really like Goodyears at all- had two sets of GSC's & will probably
never buy Goodyear again... they wear quickly, are not very sticky and they
are loud.  Decent in the rain though.  BUT, you have to remember that there
is a reason Porsche is putting S-O2's on all the new Turbos.
Just my opinion.  Have SP 8000's on my 928 right now and will be putting
P-Zeros on it very shortly- just for a change, I still love Dunlop.
