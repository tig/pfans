The June issue of 911 & Porsche World presents an All Time Top Ten Porsche
list. I know that this kind of compilation is absolutely age-related and
aleatory, influenced by present trends and by market etc. but,
nevertheless, I want to spend few words about some of their choices.
The list:
'54 356 1500S Speedster
'55 356 1500GS Carrera
'64 911 2.0
'69 914-4
'72 911 Carrera RS
'75 911 turbo
'77 911 SC
'81 924 Carrera GT
'84 944
'94 993
They claim the above cars the most commercially and historically
significant, under a "strategical" point of view. I agree that if my car
would be included in the list, probably I didn't feel the urgency to post
my opinion about... Anyway, I still can't understand why the 924 Carrera GT
was more "strategic" than the 928 ...
The actual reason of my posting is to use the top ten Porsche List as a
chance to start a reflection about the current subtle but growing habit to
consider the 964, in some way, an accident before das Letzt Wunder, the
993. The 993 is, undoubtedly,a beautiful car, a better car than her
predecessor, as always happens in the best families. Nevertheless, from an
historical point of view, this is irrelevant. Every car (painting, book,
building, music...) must be evaluated at her days and related to the entire
line of evolution. The 964, less "perfect and smooth" than the 993, less
"top of the 911 evolution", was absolutely more revolutionary compared her
predecessor than the 993 compared to the 964. A totally new structure and
floorpan, spring suspensions, the twin spark M64 (not in my 964 turbo), the
introduction of 4wd, a radical redesign of aerodynamics after twelve year
of the SC based body and, why not, a state of art ABS and a new,  now
working, A/C were  more radical changes compared to the past than a
redesigned rear axle, slicker headlights, six gears, new wipers, a new
crankshaft or hydraulic valve-adjusters are compared to the 964.
And for that reason I like very much the 993 but feel no need to trade my
964 turbo for her, since I know that market laws and not a
technical-historical evaluations, will depreciate her after a while. Now
964s are living the saddest period of their existence, just used, not still
veteran. It happened to my former Carrera 3.2 after the introduction of the
964 and, in few years, the same people who sang requiems for her will
rediscover her as the last of the classic 911... How many years they will
need for reaccept the 964 (das Letzt Wunder in 1989)?
As you know I don't care so much since on the track I don't fear any 993
(TT apart), but I'm pretty bored by this atechnical, trendy up and down. 

Hoping to start a reasonable discussion and not a  flame war...

Aldo
