Terry,

Thank you for you help so far in clarifying the various clear films
available for protecting headlight lenses and paint.  The data is
now in, at least for me.

 Per your advice, I contacted Steve Maglione (details for the P-Fan list=20
are below) as well as Stongard (used to be Those Guys).  I was=20
interested in the thin tape, not the very thick pieces that protect the=20
headlight lens.  The thin tape from the two sources are similar, but=20
not the same.  The Stongard stuff has 3M written on the backing=20
material whereas the material from Maglione is plain.  Both tapes=20
seem to be about the same thickness.  Maglione is apparently=20
going through some business changes, as it took him a long time=20
to ship the stuff.  Stongard responded to a request for literature and=20
a sample within a couple of days, it seemed.

Advice on the water mix with which to wet the surface varies from 2 oz. of=
=20
alcohol per quart to a 35% mix of alcohol and water.  Some recommend=20
that 3-4 drops of dish soap be added per quart.  I don't like working with=
=20
the stuff wet, having done one headlight on the racecar wet and one dry.
Just too hard to get things to stick down until most of the moisture is
gone.  I'd may feel quite differently if I get around to applying this stuff
to the paint.  I had only a small sample from Stongard, so I just put it=20
in the middle of the 993 headlight, as a test, long term.

Based on the 3M brand, I'll use the stuff from Stongard if I do this again,
though others could make a good case for going with Maglione, based
on his stuff being a lot cheaper.  I have no data that Maglione's tape won't=
=20
work just fine, or that it's not 3M, but the thing I like about the=
 Stong=E4rd-
supplied material is being sure it's 3M.  I've had excellent success with=20
just about anything from 3M, and often had problems with similar products=20
from other sources.

Thanks again for your help.
