as promised, i have set up a 993 list.  there are several reasons
why i did it:

- much better list software.  i have enabled a feature that will ask
for confirmation if a subscription request is sent.

- much more active and hands on list admin (me)

- i felt that 993 discussions tended to be quite different in content from
older 911 ones.

- smaller group of people and lower volume leads to friendlier
conversation and higher signal to noise.


list policies:

- discussions should be relevant to porsche 993's.  this list is not
meant to replace 911@porschefans.com;  rather it is a sub-list for those
who are interested in just this particular model.

- my organization prohibits all commercial advertising.  if you run a
business selling porsche parts or services, you may not use this list
to advertise.

- private individuals occassionally selling unwanted parts or cars is
probably ok. (until i hear otherwise)

- flamers will be asked to take it offline.  persistent trouble makers
will be removed and barred from future participation.



disadvantages of this list:

- no WWW interface to it

- digests not tested yet.  however the feature is there and i will welcome
feedback if this is not working right.  for now i have set things up to
do weekly digests sent out every sunday.



how to subscribe:

	send email to listproc@u.washington.edu

(the list software insists on you giving your name)



how to post to the list after you subscribe:

	send your posts to 993@u.washington.edu
