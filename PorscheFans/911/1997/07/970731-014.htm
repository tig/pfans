Hi

You've done everything else, so you've probably already checked this. It
may be your ignition switch.
It may be dropping too much voltage across the switch, or the wiring to
the switch. 
The ignition switch would be the only thing one of these relays would
bypass. You can buy that kind of relay at any auto supply store, the
mail order ones come with wire, connectors and instructions (hopefully).
When this happened to me, I discovered I had a 10.5 volt battery, worked
fine unless the engine/starter was too hot. One cell was shorted out.
