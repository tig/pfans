Mike,
I read your posting with interest as you have brought up a topic that has
been debated for a long time. However I would like to throw my 2 cents in...

Theoretically adding weight to the front must induce understeer as you
increase the forces of inertia which fight against your attempt to shift
direction of the vehicle.  The amount of affect from an empty to a full tank
has a great deal to do with your suspension specifications, the type of
course you are driving and your driving style. 

BUT, the overall weight of a vehicle is not nearly as important as the weight
balance. Although I have adjustable sway bars I found that at the highest
speed race tracks I am actually better off with a medium soft rear sway bar
setting and adding 75 lbs to the front of my 911C. This gave me just the
right amount of additional understeer in the highest speed corners (i.e. 90 -
125mph) yet this wasn't enough to hurt my lower speed corners where I needed
to get the rear around quickly.

In slow speed slalom style cornering the added weight can actually reduce
understeer by assisting the suspension in keeping the front end down and
affectively increasing the tire's contact patch on the road. Again this
depends on your suspension and style.

The braking? - well I don't know how it made an obvious improvement other
than you weren't going as fast and/or your corner balancing improved with the
additional weight (although I would think that would affect the wheel closest
to the gas tank...?mmmmm).

Your lap times are usually your best gauge, however, many times after making
a change in your car's setup you don't immediately drive to the new setup's
full potential. How many times have we seen someone install the latest and
greatest suspension and go slower the first time out? It happens all the
time. 

By the way - always remember that the more stable and "stuck" your car feels
the faster you still have yet to go! Keep the shiny side up.

Bestest regards,  Ross

p.s. where are you located? Got any "reasonable" Les Paul standards laying
around?
