     The user manual says Porsches burn oil but I think the one my 
     girlfriend and I have burns (way?) too much.
     
     The car has about 66k miles on it.  We drove it 540 miles on July 2.  
     I had removed an unmeasured amount before the drive because the oil 
     was just over the top mark on the dip stick.  After the drive and 
     after sitting for a few days it was down to the lower mark.  I added 2 
     qts before and during the drive back (another 540 miles) and the level 
     seemed to stay about the same.  Whenever we drive the car, we park it 
     on level ground (after being fully warmed) and let it idle for 30 
     seconds or more.  Then, we check the oil level gauge.  It seemed to be 
     holding fairly well since the last half of the long drive back and 
     through this week until yesterday.  Now, the oil gauge is showing 
     there is much less oil in the tank.  She says it will be down to the 
     low red mark in a day or two more.
     
     The car has wet oil on the bottom in a few places.  We knew this when 
     we bought it.  The check on it done by a mechanic listed several items 
     that need to be replaced to stop the leaks but they were all normal 
     Porsche maintenance things.  We deducted this cost from the price. It 
     doesn't leak enough to drip.  Even after the car is fully hot, it 
     doesn't leak enough to drip on the ground.  Also, the other night I 
     was following the car at night with my head lights on.  I can see no 
     smoke of any type coming from the exhaust.
     
     Can the car be burning this much oil and not have it be visible?  
     Could it be leaking this much and be boiling away before it reaches 
     the ground?  Any ideas?
