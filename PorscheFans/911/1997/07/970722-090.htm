It sure is hard to keep up with all this mail. Anyway, I hope these
aren't to late to help the people that asked.
	You can splice and replace sections of the oil cooler lines that go to
the front using standard copper tubing and fittings from the plumbing
section of any hardware store. Just solder them using regular acid-core
solder.

	Turbo rebuild kits are available from the US importer of KKK.

	I've bought a couple from them in the past. They were around $100. You
need to give the real model # though, ie.. 3LDZ for a K26. They told me
they did all of the rebuilding for PCNA. The guy also said if I didn't
feel comfortable doing it myself they charged about $150 labor.
(Disclaimer: no affiliation, monetary interest etc..)
	Don't lube your clutch cable. They are plastic coated and that would
just gum it up. If the plastic wears through and starts coming off, it
can make your pedal stiff. In a pinch you can strip the rest of the
plastic off and reuse the cable. I wouldn't run it long though, or it
will start wearing through the tube.
	Everyone should have a "Porsche Technical Specifications" book for
their car. You can get them from your dealer, or you can mail-order them
out of the mags for less than $10. They will answer a lot of your
questions and are interesting to read. It covers serial #'s for the car,
engine, and tranny. It also list detailed engine specs, gear ratios,
torque values, alignment specs, tune-up specs, fuses, relays, bulbs,
etc.
	When refinishing anodized wheels, they have to be polished to a mirror
shine because the anodizing dulls that to the original look.
	I put a set of Toyo T1 tires on my car the first of spring. They are
stickier than A008G's and P's, or any P7-- I've run. 3 sec. autox. And
they have a wear rating of 200, we'll see about that. Good ride, quiet,
excellent wet. (Disclaimer: same as above.)
