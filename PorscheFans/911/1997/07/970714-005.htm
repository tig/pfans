Before you get real excited about your calculated speeds, verify that
the
diameter of your tires is actually 24.88".  I bet it's not.  What I do
is make a 
mark on my garage floor next to some memorable feature of the tire, then
roll the car so that the tire makes exactly 1 revolution, make another
mark
and then measure this distance.  Divide this number by pi (3.14159) and
use this number in your calculations - I think this number is a better
approximation of the "diameter" that you're actually dealing with.

Most likely you'll find that the tire is smaller in diameter than 24.88"
and
as such, your speedometer is reading a little high.
