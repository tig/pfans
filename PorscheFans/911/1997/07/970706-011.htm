Hello P-Fans:
I've noticed some recent posts on Stongard installation, and would like to
offer suggestions, since I'm in the process of doing this work right now.
 First, the painted surface must be clean; better if the old wax is removed.
Next, both  the surface and the adhesive part of the Stongard should be
liberally sprayed with a pre-mixed  solution of water and rubbing alchohol. I
believe a 35/ 65  alchohol/water mix ( up to 50/50 perhaps)- works very well.
This acts as a "sliding" lubricant, much like wallpaper "sizing" , and helps
avoid wrinkles and bubbles. As you work the surface with the squeegee, get
out as many of the bubbles as possible. You won't get them all out, but what
remains are (hopefully) only a few, small bubbles. You need to pin-prick
these bubbles and try to work them out. Don't be discouraged if these last
few won't come out. Just make sure that there is a pin prick over these.
Within 7-9 days(!) these will dry out and will disappear!  During this
few-day waiting period, occasionally try to "work" these small bubbles out
with the squeegee, or finger pressure.  If all went well , you'll get the
factory look your after.  I've done this so far on the rear-most rocker
panels, the rear fender guards ( "sharkfins"), and the painted side of the
outside rerview mirrors. The BIG piece ( hood bra) is going to make me
nervous. I'll post the results later this summer, and advise whether
professional help was required ( window tinters, etc). Hope this helps!
