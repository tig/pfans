Joe Sommer asks some questions about alignments, a few of which I will
cast my pearls upon for what they might be worth for pre-993s:

By all means use a place with some experience with 911s.  The rear
adjustment drives even such places slightly nuts.  Most good shops use
laser/computer systems these days, although there are other methods
which can yield  equally as good results if used very carefully.  The
laser systems make it easier to get both the front and rear toe in sync
with each other and the centerline of the car.

Not many alignment shops will have the scales for corner
balancing, however.  This is a race/autocross/track setup deal.  No one
else much cares, not much demand, the setups cost $1,200 - $1,700 and
are at least a little bit fragile, which is discouraging if you only have a half
dozen customers who  want this service, etc.  It can also add quite a bit
of time/money to the process if any big changes have to be made:  align,
corner balance, realign if needed, re-corner balance, etc. until satisfied.  

Doing the alignment with you (or your weight) in the driver's seat (if that
is the condition for which you want the car aligned) is good advice
(though I am a bit dubious about just how much difference that makes -
maybe one tenth of a degree is what I have seen in stiffly sprung race
car).  Makes more difference for corner balancing, where your weight
might be as much as 10% of the car's weight.  Ditto with gas in tank,
although the tank doesn't look like its weight, full or empty, is offset any
where nearly as much as much as the driver's weight is.  Wisdom I've
heard for racing corner balancing is use half a tank, but this is for races
a lot longer than 20 minutes.  For autocrossing you can select what you
want to have in tank (say 1/4 for weight, full to get more front end
weight, whatever) for handling purposes, as you won't burn much off,
and could even replace between runs perhaps.

You are right that you should put in your new (turbo) tie rods as part of
or before (not that hard to do, you can get toe close enough through
measurement so you can drive a short way to the alignment shop) your
alignment. 

You will need to tell the shop what specs you want (unless they have
special experience with Porsches whose owners have autocross/track
stuff in mind), as otherwise they will align to factory specs, which may
not do what you want.  Historically, autocrossers want a ton of negative
camber, and trackies perhaps somewhat less.  Factory specs are
modest in this regard. 

Factory calls for some toe in to make the car want to go straight.  Zero
toe means less rolling resistance, and I haven't found it makes the car
darty at all, plus it is a spec which is easy to remember.  Some toe out in
front is said to improve turn in for autocrosses, though it can't do much
for straight line stability on a high speed track, or just on a highway
where you may not want to have to be at 99% concentration all the time
just to stay in your lane.  I've never tried toe-out, though.  Maybe I'd like it.

I have been moving with the new BFG Comp TA R-1s to less and less
negative to try to get the tires to wear evenly over the surface instead of
having the cord show up on the inside first, but I'm more concerned with
track events and tire wear at same than maximizing autocross cornering
power.  However, my concerns of years ago when first I dialed in lots of
negative for my set of track tires/rims - that my street tires would wear
out quickly on the insides - have proven unfounded, in part because I
chose to run quite hard and inexpensive street tires (Nitto), which didn't
wear much at all.

Ask the list what setup people think you need for your car, goals, and
tires - sure to provoke spirited responses.  

Walt Fricke (soon to compare his do it yourself alignment on coilover
early 911 race car which worked just great on track with what alignment
shop says it is - Wacho weight checker corner balancing got cross
weights pretty close per local club's scales)
