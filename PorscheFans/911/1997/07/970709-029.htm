Yes! I just replaced the wires on my 1980 911 SC Targa with a set of Fyrebraid
ignition wires that I picked up from Performance Products for $119. They are
red color and rated to 1400 degreees F.  They do not have the stainless steel
sheath around them.  The  OEM stainless ones are rated to 600 degree F and
cost ~$250, so I think I got a better deal.

 I had a bad connector, and probably could have gotten away with just buying a
new connector, but I was so jazzed that I found a set that didn't cost me
$250, that I decided to just replace the set.  
I have not noticed anything different about the way the car runs, nor do I
have a "High power stereo"  so I couldn't tell you if I was getting any noise
into the radio.
They look cool though as they are red, although have some oil spots from
installation.
Their are other "standard" sets for generic 6 cylinder engines that are even
cheaper.  I have no experience with those.  Maybe someone else does.

    All,
     I just looked at the engine in a darkened garage, and it looked like 
     an electrical show in there.  Anyways, it appears time for a new set 
     of plug wires for my 1980 911SC.  My question is, is the steel braided 
     line covering the plug wires necessary for something?  If not, it 
     appears that there are plenty of high-quality wires sets out there for 
     much less than the factory braided sets.  Anyone switch theirs to 
     non-braided wires?
     
     Thanks,
     Alex Gilmour
