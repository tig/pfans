What model of Allen Wrench have you tried? My '71 was like this, almost
completely rounded out heads, and I just couldn't get them out, I was
using some craftsman allen sockets, and they just spun round in neet
tidy circles. A friend of mine asked why I bothered with Craftsman and
handed me a rail of his Snap-On allen keys, which worked no problem,
spun the bolts right out! You might try finding one to use. The other
technique is to drill the head off of them, pull the seat out and then
use a stud puller to get the remaining bolt out.

Subject: remove seat, oil change '89 911

     My girlfriend just bought a 1989 911 Carrera Coupe, black with grey

     (parchment?) leather, black wheels, spoilers.  Neat car.
     
     We'd like to remove the driver's seat because an aftermarket stereo

     has been installed there and we need to get to it.  The seat is
held 
     to the tracks via six (6mm) Allen head bolts.  Two of these bolts
have 
     the inside of them fairly rounded.  Unfortunately, the outside of 
     these bolts is complete round AND it is inside of a trough.  Do you

     have any suggestions for getting bolts like this out?  Is there 
     another way to remove the seat besides unbolding it from the track?
     
     Also, the car will be going on a fairly long drive over the 4th and

     its time to change the oil.  I understand it takes 13 quarts.  Good

     thing my oil catch pan can hold 15 qts.  The only manual we have at

     this time is the user manual that came with the car.  The Helm
manual 
     will be ordered soon.  Is there anything special to a 911 oil
change?  
     Any tips or instructions would be great since we won't have the
shop 
     manual anytime soon.
     
     Thanks in advance.
