Hi,
   I'm trying to locate the transaxle number 915/01, 915/02, 915/12, etc. on
my 72 Targa.  Is this number or the serial number visible with the engine
and transaxle in the car?
  Also while inspecting one of the rear rotors while removed from the car I
uncovered two cracks in the drum portion of the rotor.  These cracks extend
from the inside inner edge of the drum portion, under the disc portion,
towards the  the outer mounting portion of the rotor near the base of the
disc rotor.  Kind of hard to describe obviously.  The question is do I need
to replace the rotor, and this means both rotors for equal braking?  These
cracks have apparently been there for a long time and I would have never
seen them had I not removed the rotor.  So am I lucky that I caught them, or
should I ignore them?

Pls post and e-mail direct.

Thanks in advance.
Mark
