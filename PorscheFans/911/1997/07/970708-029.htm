Thanks much.  On my bimmer, I did it all.  Reason I put relays in at all
is that I had two PIA H-4's that were ceramic based and had 100 watts for
the low beams and 175 watts for the high.  They were simply unequaled.  I
would like to put the same arrangement on a 911.  However, I have not
found a kit for mounting the PIA on the trunk.  I beleive that they
exist; the problems is to find them.  I may have to go to Europe to find
them.  I guess that I could go to a machine shop and have them made, but
that is lots of bother and would be real expensive.
