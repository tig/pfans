Kahler's, in Pleasanton, has a huge following, and did good work for me.
Ask for Denny, he owns the joint, and will talk to you over the phone.

Another shop that I've been pleased with is about 10 miles north of
Kahler's, in San Ramon.  It is called something like "German Auto
Service"...sorry, I can't ever remember without looking at the card
(which is home in my desk). 
A fellow named Mickey owns it, and is the chief wrench there.  Small
shop with friendly service and good prices.  I had my major done there,
and because he had the car longer than promised, installed ( supplied by
me) a short shift kit for free.

These are probably farther away from Berkeley than you would prefer
(about 30 miles), but they are relatively close, and the only two I've
had experience with.

Hope it helps,

John D.
