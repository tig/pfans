     I just replaced the Michelin XGT Vs on my car with a set of BFG Comp 
     T/A ZRs.  The most apparent thing I noticed with how much softer they 
     feel in everyday driving.  Pavement joints and such don't seem to 
     thump as much with the T/As as with the XGTs.  Since I can't come 
     close to driving this car at its limits I can't really comment on 
     their high performance aspects.  All I can say is that they haven't 
     given me any surprises when driven hard.
     
     Does anyone know what OEM tires originally came on my car?  From the 
     DOT codes on the tire sidewalls I presume the XGTs were the OEMs.  I 
     replaced them at 37K miles and considering that the two POs were 
     pretty easy on the car I can believe the XGTs might be the OEMs.
