I have an '85 Carrera, and I'm a retired accountant who has never done any
car maintenance himself. After waiting 30 years to get my first Porsche, I
decided I was going to change the oil myself. If I can do it, anybody can do
it! Steps to change oil:

1) The 911 holds 11 + or - quarts of oil so you need a BIG oil catching pan
to handle all that volume. I got mine at Pep Boys-it holds 15 quarts of oil
(incidently, when I change oil I take the pan into Pep Boys and they dispose
of the old oil for free). It is large, wide and, if I'm lucky catches all the
oil that comes rushing out of the 911. 
2) I change my oil about every 4-5 thousand miles. You'll hear different
opinions on this issue-the factory recommends changing every 15k. I change
the air filter every other oil change. I get my air, oil filters from the
local Porsche dealer. And don't forget to get the brass ringed gasgets for
the two oil drains.Last time I changed, oil filter was $6.80, brass ringed
gasgets were $.74, air filter was $10.00. I've changed recently to Castrol
Syntek-I think a case of 12 qts was $23.88. I usually go through the extra
quart before the next oil change.
3) The 911 has two, yes two, oil drains. By far the biggest in terms of oil
volume is in the bottom of the oil tank,  just to the rear of the rear tire.
If you get on your knees at the rear of the tire and peer under the fender,
you'll see the oil drain in the bottom of the oil tank. If your engine is
hot, let it cool off before changing oil-that's a lot of hot oil to mess
with. Put that big oil catching pan under the oil tank oil drain and be sure
it's top is open and the little air cap is also open-you don''t want anything
to interfere with the oil going into the catching pan because THERES A LOT OF
OIL AND IT COMES FAST. Consider yourself ahead of the game if you only get a
small splash on the garage floor. Let it all drain out, get a brass ring
gasget-apply some fresh oil to it with your finger and replace the drain
plug-torque it firmly-not tight.. 
4) The second drain plug is in the bottom of the engine. If you go to the
rear of the car, kneel at the center and look towards the front-under the
car. The drain is on the left of the portion of the engine that is between
the two exhaust type pipes. Drain that also-you can see that the drain points
to the left-position your pan so as to accomodate the left thrust of the
outrushing oil. Again, put on a brass ring with fresh oil and tighten the
drain plug firmly-not tight.
5) Oil filter is on the right hand side of the engine (looking toward the
front of the car). I always get a bunch of paper towels and wad them up under
the filter before I remove it to catch any oil that comes out when I'm
unscrewing the filter. I use them to grab the filter, once unscrewed and
turned downwards to minimize oil leakage. Get the new filter, put fresh oil
on the rubber ringed gasget and put the new filter on. 
6) Air filter is located in the air box in rear box on the right hand side of
the engine. The box has what looks like a horn that protrudes just infront of
where you fill the oil. There are four clips that hold the filter in place.
Two in front and two in the rear-and the bottom one in the rear is a bitch to
reclip--I always have my wife do it with her small hands. 
7) Oh yeah, now put in the oil. I always put in 10 quarts, take it out and
drive it up to engine temperature and then put in the 11th quart. Sometimes
it takes the full 11th quart, sometimes only part of it-I use the dipstick to
determine how much of that last quart I use. 

Well that's how a novice does it-it works for me.
