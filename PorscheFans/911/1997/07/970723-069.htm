Hi P-Fans:

This technique actually works very well.  Though it takes about a week to
just get used to it. I highly recommend it.

I just picked up an '82 911SC Euro and have a few wonderfull questions:

1.  My 'DRUCK PRES' gauge flys around like it's on steroids. My logic says
it should be relativly smooth and based on RPMS as it measures oil pressure
that is created by the duel pump right off the drive shaft. However, at idle
it bounces from 1-4.  When I get to about 2.5k RPM it reads out above 5 and
stays there. My guess is the oil pressure sending unit, P-FANS?

2.  If I turn off the car and take the key out I can still turn on all the
electrical stuff(radio, lights,etc...).  Is this normal?

3.  Getting into third gear is bassed on luck. Actually it isnt that bad. It
seems as if the stick just bearly makes it in and then wants badly to pop
right out.  There are no grinding sounds or anything of that nature, just
that it is hard to find and when I get there it never seems as if I really
am.  With a comparrison to second, I am developing muscles I never knew I
had.  It takes some strength and then second snaps in.  Fourth is similer
but needs less umph. There is a short shift kit installed and the stick
itself is rather short and does not give me much of a mechanical advantage.
Does this mean I need to adjust my trans. or just the shifting mechanism? I
had to go out and buy some gloves because my palm was getting really sore
(and I have already heard a dozen perverted things about my sore palm, thanx)

I have not looked at the mechanism at all, but I plan too as soon as I get
the manuals I ordered }:)

There is a whole bunch of other stuff I have to fix, but these are the only
ones that are not cosmetic in nature that concern me.

Lastly, how easy is it to adjust the valves for a mechanically inclined
person? My pre-purchase inspector said the valves needed adjusting... 

I must say, my left leg is getting a hell of a work out.  Perhaps I might
loose this gut I have developed if I drive more? Now look at me, I am making
excuses to go driving.....

Well, enjoy!

Michael
