Luther, thanks for the tip and the phone #, I will add it to my Rolodex.

I just got off of the phone with another dealer, and they were able to 
find the needed parts for me.  For those who are interested, here is the
deal;
My car is an 84, so I asked for dash parts for an 84...the problem is
that the dash fiche for 84 doesn't show them, the '83, however, does.

Which brings up a follow-on question:

The parts guy said that the 84 dash has one large defroster vent in the
middle of the dash, and the earlier 83 (SC) dashes have the two smalleer
vents, one on each side.  My car is definitely an 84, apparently with an
earlier dash.  

What gives here?  Did they use left-over SC dashes in the Carrera's?
