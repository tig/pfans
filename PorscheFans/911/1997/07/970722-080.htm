Your hot start problem *might* be caused by a problem with the fuel
accumulator gizmo.  It is located somewhere between  the fuel pump and
the engine.  Its job is to maintain fuel pressure in the fuel line so
that the gas will actually spray when you re-start the engine.  There's
some kind of diaphram (or something) inside the accumulator that wears
out over time; when this happens, fuel pressure to the engine is no
longer maintained when the motor is off; hence, hard re-starts.

That's just one possibility.  I'm sure others can think of different
problems that can cause hard hot re-starts. 

Good luck.  Hope you get it fixed.
