>Hello all, I'm the proud owner of a 74 911T, yea !!!  It was a "blind" 
buy, saw it on the auction block and >won the bid sans inspection.

Congrats!   There wasn't a '74 911T.  Last 'T' was in '73, maybe you 
have a '74 911S?

>1.  Turn Signal does not blink.  Stays on solid. Do I replace the 
relay or what ?  On the other hand the >hazard lights blink OK.  Since 
this relay performs both functions of turn signal & hazard, perhaps it 
is not >the relay.

I've had this problem and the bulb wasn't properly grounded.   Try 
unscrewing and cleaning
to see if this works.

>2.  I'd like to drain & refill the tranny fluid, but could not locate 
a drain plug.

Large Allen head nut, loosen filler nut first.

>3.  The engine seems to like a temp of 250 deg.  Upon starting and 
engine cool, oil pres builds up to 40 >or 60.  At 200 + temp, pres 
drops to 20 and then zero on the gauge.  What do I look for here or is 
this >"normal" ?

250 is too high, 180-210 is normal, 230 getting hot...  Rule of thumb for oil
pressure is 10-15psi for every 1000 rpms.   Change the oil first if you
haven't done so already.  With an unknown quantity like an auction car, I'd
do a complete tune-up of plugs, filters,  fluids, valve adjustment etc 
since I assume
you got no records with the car.

Good luck with it!
