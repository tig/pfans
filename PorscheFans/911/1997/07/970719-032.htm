Hi there,

I've just gotten back from a long trip to Europe, which of course =
included
a visit to Germany!  Luckily I was able to convince my two non-car loving
fans to accompany me to the Porsche museum in Stuttgart.  Well, first
things first (or let me say the most exciting to me!) was when we left =
the
museum (this is for all the 911 fans who don't want to read on about the
museum).  We were walking along a road which runs right next to the
factory, right after leaving the museum exit.  Well, I wasn't paying
attention to the cars coming up behind us (wish I was!) because a Porsche
passed us at a fairly slow speed (there's a tight corner that was right
behind us).  Well, immediately my sense were heightened because this 911
had the "boxster style" tail lamps and was slightly sleeker looking. I =
was
thrilled, realizing this was the new 996!  I knew I had no time to get my
camera out, so I just decided to enjoy the show. The car pulled away
quickly, and I was enthralled by the sound that it's new engine made. It
went up to a "T" in the road at the other end of the factory, made a left
turn and pulled away at a very fast rate.  The sound the engine made was
fantastic! There was no attempt made at camouflage (pictures of the car
are already released by Porsche anyway), except perhaps for the color,
which was all black.

Well, I can't really comment that much on the car (I didn't even get to
see the front treatment) but there are a few things I can say from my
brief observations.  Contrary to some thoughts (my own in particular!)
from seeing the early pictures, this car is beautiful! The rear end is
very sleek looking, and the car looks much racier and lower in height =
too.
I'm not sure what the exact height dimensions are, although this could be
an illusion because of the longer body of the car.  The tail lamps, which
I was not crazy about before, look great too.  Finally, the sound is
something that cannot be explained and is a wonder to behold.  I drove a
boxster a few months back, and the sound does not compare at all.  The =
new
996 has the same turbine-like whine of the air cooled cars, yet sounds
super strong when revved up and has a very deep powerful sound. The
experience was something that had me excited the rest of the day, and my
friends just couldn't comprehend why:)

Well, on to the museum and some other interesting Porsches I saw.  The
Porsche museum is very small - yet they do a good job of placing as many
cars in there as possible.  There was the 1950 356 "Ferdinand" coupe =
which
was one of the most impressive cars to see in real life. Some of the =
other
interesting cars (I'll list all that I can remember) were a 59 type 718 =
RS
60 spyder, Porsche 62 type 804 Formula 1 race car, 356 A 1600 speedster,
73 917/30 spyder (Donahue's), Paris to Dakar rally car, 917 short-tail,
917 long tail (one of the coolest cars there!), 956, 936, 959, early VW
beetle, and the one-off 911 Panamericana. There were also numerous
engines, the most impressive being the experimental 16 cylinder 917
engine. I'd be happy to comment more on the individual cars that I saw if
somebody would like me to, but this message is already getting pretty
long! :)

Some other interesting cars I saw on the trip were a stainless steel 911S
at the Deutsches museum, and an Audi A4 Quattro Wagon with Porsche turbo
brake calipers and wheels which was heavily modified (besides just the
brakes). =20

I also received some pictures from my grandfather - he and a few friends
raced a 911S and 914-6 back in 72-73 at SCCA events like Road America and
Watkins Glen, and so he has many cool pictures from his races, plus other
cars (like a BMW 3.0 CSL, Mike Rahal's 906 - knew him and young Bobby
personally, Hurley Haywood's RSR, 908's, etc.). If anybody has a web site
and would like to post these pictures let me know! I had a fantastic =
time,
and have many great stories. I'm also a big military history and aviation
buff so I have many pictures and stories from the museums that I attended
and I'd be happy to share stories with others interested in these topics.
I hope my long e-mail didn't bore too many people!:)
