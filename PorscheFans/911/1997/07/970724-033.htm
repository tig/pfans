I noticed the same thing, this has been ocurring over the last several years. 
 I also like the Targa, have ever since I first saw one.  I belive the price
break is due to principally consumers falling into one of two schools, the
Coupe and the Cabriolet.  The middle ground where the Targa resides has become
the odd man out, however, I have benifitted from this myself, having purchased
a Targa.  I belive the people who really want the wind in their hair typically
opt for the Cab, and those that don't go with the Coupe.  
I know I am sterotyping a bit, but that is simply my opinion.  
I regards to your question, do they leak?  Absolutely, so do Cabs.  I simply
drive a different car when it rains, which in LA isn't really all that often. 
even if I am caught in the rain in the Targa, it doesn't really pour into the
car, just drips annoyingly.
There is a little body flex with the targa that I do not notice when I drive
my wife's coupe, but it is very slight, I noticed it a LOT more in my Supra
Targa.  
I strongly suggest you drive both types of cars so you can experience it
yourself.  You may not like it, or maybe not even notice it.
MY personal suggestion, If you really want the Targa, get one.  I love mine,
leaks and all.

good luck

Subject: What's the deal with targas ?

Hi all,

I am starting to research the 911 market for a future purchase, probably
in the coming 3 months or so, and I am looking at 80/83 911 SCs and
early carreras (well, 84 only!). Well, that's pretty much what all that
I can afford (I am selling my GTI VR6 for this). 
It seems that on all classifieds, targas come cheaper than coupes. That
I don't understand. What's wrong with them ? Is the top leaking ? Is the
car less solid with a T top ?  Other problems ?  I am personnaly more
attracted to the shape of the coupe, but I thought a "hair in the wind"
car like a targa would actually be more expensive ! If they are cheaper
(and they seem to be by one or 2 grands for comparable cars), maybe I'll
get one after all.. Advise, please !  ;-) 

Thanks !   Greg.
