Hi There, 

I was driving along today in my '87 911, and the engine started make a
strange noise.  It seemed to be rising and falling in noise level at
constant intervals that lasted about one second each.  It sounded something
like this:  AAAHHHHHNNNN  aaaahhhhhnnnn AAAAAAHHHHHNNNNN aaaahhhhnnnn.  I
turned down the radio (to be certain that it wasn't a gimmick being forced
upon me by Tori Amos) and then I slowed down.  As I did slow, the noise
continued until I down-shifted, at which point the entire car lurched and
the engine died.  So there I was, coasting along with the engine off. 
Well, I'll tell you, I put that car in neutral and I started it right back
up.

It seemed to drive fine for a while after that, but when I stopped a few
minutes later for a traffic light, it died again.  Well, I'm telling you,
what happened next will completely blow you away.  I started 'er up again
and, well, she ran fine from there on out.  Dang.

So anyway, what might have caused this to happen?  I stopped off at my
friendly mechanic's shop and interrupted him from what seemed like a very
unpleasant mechanical session with a late '80's Jaguar.  He was calling it
foul names and spitting a lot.

Anyway, he said something about "Gol-derned Motronics" and "it's one of
them dangnabbed switches".  He told me to bring it in on Monday. 

Can anyone here tell me what "Gol-derned Motronics" are?  Further, can
anyone here describe the significance of "dangnabbed switches", especially
in conjunction to their relationship with "Gol-derned Motronics"?

Also, can anyone here explain this?  In my younger days as a pot-smoking
hippy college failout, I drove a Volkswagen bug.  I am not (I repeat:  I am
NOT) making any gratuitous comparisons between bugs and 911's, so don't go
jumping all over my ass, okay?  What I am saying is that when I used to
drive this bug (which lasted about 300 miles until it blew up), it would
sometimes do this lurch, wheeze, sputter thing before it got warmed up.  My
dad owned a Vanagon that did the same thing.  I figured that since these
were both air-cooled engines, coupled with the fact that my 911 quit doing
this "thing" once it was warmed up, might offer some explanation as to why
this is happening to my pretty car.


One more thing.  Sometimes when I am at lower speeds in second gear, the
car kind of makes this grinding noise -- like maybe I am going to slow to
be in second gear (but I'm not).  Does that help or make any sense to
anyone out there?

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer (and for putting up with me).

Frank Ahlgren

P.S.  -- If, as you read my post, you tried to imitate out loud the sound
my car was making, I feel sorry for you.
