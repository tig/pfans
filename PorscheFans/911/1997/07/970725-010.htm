I am restoring my 1970 911 T ,  presently  it is in about four different
locations.  The body is in one city being completed, the engine is in another
and so on.   I have run into some problems though,  My 2.2 has webbers and it
now appears as though they are beyond repair, I do not want to put zeniths
back on, so now I am in search of one, perhaps two used Webbers.  If anyone
has one or a set I am in the market, I will pay cash if I must, but would
prefer to offer a trade.  I am a pack rat so the items I can trade do not
have to be Porsche related.  I would also appreciate any advise on wheel
restoration (Fuchs) 

Please send responses to
