Not knowing the year model of your car, it could be the starter solenoid
that is sticking. When the engine/gearbox/starter is hot from driving
the solenoid sticks. Does your car push start easily? My car would
always start cold but not hot. I had my starter and solenoid
rebushed/furbished and the problem went away. It is a similar problem to
what is described below in the fuel pump.
Good luck
