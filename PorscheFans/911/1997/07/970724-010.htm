>Still got that beautiful yellow '87 targa? We corresponded about a year
and a half ago on the topic of whether you were willing to sell it......

>OK, tires. Today's high-performance tires are designed with extremely
stiff sidewalls, and short (shallow) tread blocks, specifically to prevent
the kind of tread squirming that produces the howl you hear from ordinary
tires when they're pushed hard. Also, this type of design is intended to
help the car hold on to the corner right up until the slip andgle and roll
deflection exceed its limits. At that point, the tire patch is actually
lifted off the road surface, (think tilting a board up from a flat surface)
and goodbye traction! Your Bridgestone RE-71s fall in the high-performance
category, ergo, no squeal, no slip until they're right at the limit.
>
>Although their breakaway is more pronounced and comes with less warning,
RE-71s do have a narrow band of "warning time". The warning comes from the
car motion, not tire noise, and needs some getting used to. If you've
lowered the car, it has less body roll before bottoming on the suspension
stops. The key, as for all 911s, is to anticipate your best cornering
speed, enter the corner slightly slower than that, and accelerate all the
way through. Once you put your foot down to accelerate, DON'T EVER PICK IT
UP! I'm not as good as describing it as Bob White is (U. Chicago, Autmotive
Engineering Professor) but on deceleration, the semi-trailing arm design of
the rear suspension unloads, the rear of the car rises, and if it's
turning, the effect is to kick the tail outward away from the direction of
the turn.
>
>You mentioned you had autocrossed the car. Do more of that, it's the best
way to get more "feel" for waht's happening at a relatively slow speed.
Don't go out to win, go out to gradually increase your speed and feel how
the car responds.
>
>Another idea..... If you aren't a member, join Porsche Club of America and
attend their driver education programs. These are closed-course, non-racing
events designed to teach safe high-speed driving. As a 20-year veteran of
PCA and an instructor for PCA's Zone I, (northeastern US and eastern
Canada), I can attest to their effectiveness. The Club is also a great
source of information about all aspects of the marque, and a good
connection for less-than-dealer-cost parts and accessories.

>Please let me know if any of this makes sense, or if other questions arise
from it.
