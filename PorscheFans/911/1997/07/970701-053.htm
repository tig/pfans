Thank you for everyone's help in rebuilding my front brake calipers.  There
were many ideas that created a great pool of knowledge to draw from.  I
believe the rebuild was successful.....but.....I just took the car out for a
test drive and unfortunately i still have the original problem (car pulls to
the right under very heavy braking.)  Any suggestions on what to check
next?????  I will be rebuilding the rear calipers next, but i don't think
that will fix the problem(just a guess).  Then i'm on to the master cylinder,
but i'm not sure if i want to tackle that project.  How difficult is it to
change the master cylinder?   Am i better off having someone do the work and
diagnosis versus me??  Question....I bleed the brakes by myself with a
Mityvac brake bleeder, is that technique just a good as the usual two person
technique?

Thanks for everyone's help,
