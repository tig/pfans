<< 5) Oil filter is on the right hand side of the engine (looking toward the
 front of the car). I always get a bunch of paper towels and wad them up
under
 the filter before I remove it to catch any oil that comes out when I'm
 unscrewing the filter. I use them to grab the filter, once unscrewed and
 turned downwards to minimize oil leakage. Get the new filter, put fresh oil
 on the rubber ringed gasget and put the new filter on.  >>

Just a note to add to Rich Brown's excellent writeup.  After removing the oil
filter, particularly if it appeared to be overly "tight", make sure the
sealing gasket in the filter mounting face has not separated and bonded to
the oil line mating surface in fender of the engine compartment.  Some
"cheap" non-OEM oil filters, non-lubricated gaskets, or overly tightened
filters (by dealers or "other" oil change "specialists") can separate and
leave the oil gasket still on after filter removal and when you put the new
filter over the top and start the engine... instant oil mess!  Hand tighten
only!

And check the oil level, engine fully warmed at idle as noted.  Even after 25
years of 911 ownership, I have never seen even a dealer add oil to bring the
car to the correct level (usually overfilled).  Moral...change it yourself on
pre-993 911's at least.
