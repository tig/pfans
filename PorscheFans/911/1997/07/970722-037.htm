> "Try it: It Works! Some of the most serious preventable accidents occur
> because of blind spots while driving.  Now there is a remarkable simple
> solution discovered by an engineer named George Platter.  He presented his
> method at the prestigious Society of Automotive Engineers.  The National
> Safety Council  tested his theory and discovered, to their amazement, that
> it works! The method has been tested and fully endorsed by the National
> Safety Council as described in their September/October issue of Traffic
> Safety.  Here's how it works.

> First, forget how we learned to adjust our outside mirrors by plopping
> behind the steering wheel and turning the mirrors so that we just saw the
> side of our car looking back at us in the mirrors.  Instead, adjust the
> driver's side mirror by resting your head against the driver's side window
> and then turning the mirror so that you just see the side of your car.  Once
> this is set, move to the center of the vehicle and turn the passenger side
> mirror so that you can just see the side of your car from the center of the
> vehicle.  That's it. You won't see your own car in either mirror, yet what
> you will see is far better. Cars behind you show up as usual in the inside
> rear-view mirror above the dash, but the instant the car leaves your field
> of vision from the rear-view mirror the outside mirror picks it up.  No
> blind spot; no delays; no wondering where that car about to pass you has
> disappeared to; and no waiting a few seconds for the car that you just saw in
> your rear-view mirror to show up in your outside mirrors.  All three mirrors
> work in harmony with one another, and the blind spot has been eliminated!"
