This reminded me of the other night (and a couple of weekends ago).  Street
racing has always been big here in Evansville.  There was even a group of
doctors who would go out on our bypass about 2am every weekend and race each
other.  Quite a sight to see a Lotus Turbo Esprit, Ferrari 512, 500SEL AMG
Benz, 911 Turbo and various other cars screaming around the town.  Anyway, I
was on Hwy 41 here in town and there was a motorcycle (1997 Honda CBR 600F3)
behind me ( I was driving the 930).  He was reving his engine a little bit,
but I just took off normally.  After I got to about 8 mph I decided what the
heck, and I punched it.  By this time he had already cut in front of the car
that was to my left and buried his throttle.  Now I know that 930's are fast,
but I always though motorcycles were extremely fast (I even owned a CBR 600),
and this guy never got farther next to me than my rear bumper.  And he was
definitely on the throttle.  We both got on the brakes at 100mph.  The same
thing happened to me the other night too.  I was driving back toward my house
and there was a guy on an older (94/95) Suzuki GSX-R750.  I was cruising
along in 2nd gear when he downshifted suddenly and blipped his throttle.
 Having none of that I promptly floored the accelerator and proceeded to
absolutely walk off and leave him.  And yes he did wind his bike out, and I
didn't get any type of "jump" on him.  We quit at 70mph b/c it was a narrow
street.  I was very impressed.  Anyone else had any experiences such as
these?  It makes for intereting reading!
