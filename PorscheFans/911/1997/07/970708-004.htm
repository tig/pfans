I've been following this thread with some interest since I'm one of the
wannabes.  The thing I'd like to add is actually from Vic Elford.  In his
"Porsche Performance Driving Handbook" or something like that, he said that
one time he was following no less than Jim Clark and noticed that Jim was
braking much earlier than he was.  When he asked Jim about it later, he
said that it allowed him to get on the power much sooner, giving him a
better exit speed and better overall times.  When Elford tried it he found
that Clark was right on the money.

Something else he said also struck me.  Every once in a while, he'd get
into a zone where he could make the car "dance."  A really fantastic
feeling.  He said that Jimmy danced *all* the time!  Man would I have loved
to see him drive . . . .

p.s.  I think my above reference is correct.  Blame any errors on my
distinct lack of caffeine this morning.
