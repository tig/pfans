my wastegate sticks most of the time occasionally it does free up to show 8 bar.

but most of the time it will peg the needle past the 1 bar line...

ques.....how much pressure can this be putting in the cylinders????  I have been

watching the boost but ocassionally wind out a few gears and hold it at 1 bar

or more (I assume) for a few seconds.....am I risking doing serious damage????

can the stock turbo put out that much boost????  I have been putting off taking

the wgate apart...since I'm getting boost the diaphragm is okay right???

so could the problem be maybe some carbon sticking the gate??? can the wgate

be taken apart at home with no special tools??? I would like to put in a 1 bar

spring when I take it apart....I've been told by a porsche shop(in HNL) that

this is safe with the stock intercooler????
