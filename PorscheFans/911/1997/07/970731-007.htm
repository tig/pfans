Hello all, I have a 911 Bosch H1 headlight assembly for sale, never used,
brand new in original box. This unit has seperate bulbs for high and low
beam with both seperately adjustable, so that low can be set for city
driving while the high beam for long distance. I have been told they are
the best ones to have, so when a friend had this one cheap I bought it. I
have since found out that I can't use it legally, as I'm in Australia, and
with righ-hand-drive the low beam points the wrong way. Luckily I found
this out before I ordered a second light.
	I paid $195 dollars for it and I saw them in Performance Products for $389
each. I would like my money back and with the currency conversion at
roughly 76cents Australian per US dollar, it would cost you guys in the US
only about US$148. I think the airmail costs would probably be another
$10-$20. I can accept VISA and MASTERCARD through my business. Perhaps
someone might have something we can swap? Please email me if interested.
	Regards, Dean.
