============================================================
I second that emotion.  The place for flaming is the flamers group.  If
there are few subscibers to the flamers group then that is an indication
of the level of interest in that subject area.  I realize its tough to
reply to whatever piques ones ire on a list other than the original list
but if we don't do that then we are perpetuating the "circle of flame". 
I don't see this as a limitation on free speach or on the vitality of
the group.  It simply the courtesy of not involving people in an
argument that they have no desire to be involved in.  Its the net
equivalent to "take it outside".  Those want to watch are free to
follow.

Just my .02 worth
