Hello All,
     I installed the tensioner upgrade kit about a month ago, and had many of 
the same questions about the price range from supplier to supplier. From what 
I found out, all of the kits apparently come from the same manufacturer, an 
OEM supplier. So, when I called Vertex, they said that yes, theirs were from 
this same supplier, and I bought the kit from them. I did not have any 
problems, and all of the parts looked fine to me. I also bought the updated 
support arms from them. I would recommend them to anybody based on my 
experience. Also, when you call them and order the kit, he will ask you what 
price you saw the kit advertised at. I thought this was funny, until I got my 
first issue of Panorama, and in the Pano ad the kit was $325. I think that the 
support arms were $5-$10 cheaper as well. Keep this in mind when ordering.

    Also, when I was getting ready to do the upgrade, I was looking for some 
sort of instructions, and eventually got in touch with Alan Caldwell who has 
written a number of article on this procedure. He was very helpful and sent me 
quite a comprehensive package of articles detailing the entire process. If 
anyone is interested, I could fax them a copy. Let me know.

   As far as installing the kit goes, it went fairly easily. This was the 
first time I had done anything major to a Porsche engine. You spend more time 
removing things to get at the few areas for the upgrade than you do actually 
installing the tensioners. Basically, if there is something in your way, 
remove it instead of trying to go around it and you will save a lot of time. 
Just be sure to keep good track of what goes where, and make sure everything 
goes back in exactly the way it was before. When removing the tensioners and 
chain wheels, you must do something to keep tension on the chain as it is 
absolutely important that the chain does not skip any teeth on the cam or 
crankshaft sprockets. Most people that I have heard of recommend using some 
soft wire, or some sort of wood blocks. I thought about it and ended up using 
long nylon zip-ties. They worked great. They fit nicely between the links in 
the chain, and you could just run them through the chain, and pull them tight 
against what ever area you were pulling against. When you were done, you could 
just snip them and pull them out. I tied together the chain around the top and 
bottom of the cam sprocket to keep it from jumping a tooth, then to keep the 
whole thing from rotating I tied from the bottom part of the chain to one of 
the studs on the top, and vice-versa. This worked out very well for me, and I 
couldn't think of a downside of using them. 

    I would like to thank everyone on the list who helped me along in first 
deciding to do the upgrade, and finally in how to do it. 

Regards, 
--Josh
