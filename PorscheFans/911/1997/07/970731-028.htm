I've got an intermittent no *very*-hot start. It's happened twice on
road-trips now... Pound out 400 miles, stop for gas, try to start the car,
nada. I hear the fuel pump buzz, but no click, no starter. The first time I
was planning to stop for the night anyway, I let the car sit over night, it
started fine the next morning. The second time I was around 200 miles shy of
home, we push started the car(arrrghhh), ran fine, drove it home. It wouldn't
turn over the next morning, or the morning after(OK, *that* strikes me as
odd), started fine that evening. Of course, the service appointment wan't
until the day after that, so by the time I took the car in it wasn't faulting
anymore. And despite being used as a commuter car in the intervening 3
months, nothing has happened since. And, to get it to fault I have to drive
it 400 miles, which by it's nature has me nowhere near a shop I'm likely to
get an appointment in. 

So, I know it's probably either the ignition switch, or the starter solenoid,
and I want to drive the car to Corvallis, OR late in September, and since I'm
going to a wedding, I'm *not* going to want to screw with mechanical problems.

I was thinking of preemptively replacing the starter, when it occured to me
that if it is the starter, odds are strong it's just the solenoid. Is it
possible to purchase a solenoid for less cash than the cost of a starter, and
is it replacable seperately(for my *other* cars, it's not economic to just
buy the solenoid)? Can one pull the starter on a G50 equipped 3.2 without
pulling parts of the exhaust system? And does anyone have a plausible
explaination for the delayed starting ability on the second incident? That
one was helping to raise some doubts about this being solely a hot start
problem, but since it hasn't happened in almost 3 months I've almost
convinced myself it is "just" a hot start problem.

Thanks,
Alex
