Well, not ALL of us, but it's on my list of things to do (for both the
SHO and Porsche).  :-)

One of the SHOtimers (and former One Lap competitor) owns a Dynojet shop,
plus The SHO Shop in Huntington Beach has a Dynojet also. Due to the
relatively limited production of the Yamaha 3.0 V6, plus a limited number
of performance parts available (which tend to be pricey), there was a lot
of hype as to what mods were REALLY effective. The Dynojet clarifies a
lot of these issues. The Dynojet is a reliable measurement tool, plus it
is relatively inexpensive and is easy to set up and use.  Measuring HP at
the wheels is what really counts, anyway. Dynojet locations can be found
at www.dynojet.com (although the last time I tried the locator wasn't
working). The Yamaha motor is similar to the Porsche motors in that they
are (relatively) low displacement, high-rpm motors that don't produce a
lot of torque, so mods must be done carefully so you don't kill your
mid-range (plus SHOs are heavier so it is a greater concern with them). 
After I test the Porsche (stock 3.2) I'll post the results here.
