Was really interested in the beginning of the thread posted by Darrel a =
couple of weeks ago about the Carrera speedo intermittently quitting - =
but didn't notice any list responses (maybe they were sent back to =
Darrel rather than the list?).

Anyway, I have an '87 911 Carrera where the speedo has a mind of its own =
- operates fine for the first 10 - 15 minutes - then kicks off.  After =
resting overnight, the cycle starts again.  The problem is only occurs =
in cold (?) weather (less than 45-50 F) has hasn't repeated since the =
warmer months arrived. When the speedo/odometer cuts out, there are =
other circuits that are dead too - like the windshield wiper delay (no =
delay, always on if the main switch is on), the wiper motor doesn't come =
to rest at its stop point, the cruise control is dead (never used =
anyway...).  Taken it to two shops and both are mystified.  Checked the =
steering column switches, relays work and its driving me nuts.

Any suggestions or thoughts?  Thanks in advance for any info.
