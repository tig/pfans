When My 84 did something simular it was the relay located in the well with the 
blower motor toward the pasenger side wall.

Subject: 	AC


     This is my third post on the subject and so far I've had a total of 0 
     responses, but I'm convinced somebody in the group has some experience 
     with after-market rotary air conditioners (please help!). 
     
     I'm pretty sure I have an electrical problem and I'm trying to trouble 
     shoot it to find the source.  The AC turns itself off after a few 
     minutes on high, but runs fine on med. or low.  I can turn it back on 
     high after a few minutes, but it won't run for long.  Here's what we 
     know:  the power wire that connects to the back of the AC switch gets 
     extremely hot if the air is on.  My first (somewhat) educated guess 
     was that the switch was bad and was the source of the interference.  
     Wrong.  New switch and same problem.  Second, there's no fuse where 
     there should be a fuse!?  I put a fuse in the place for the AC just to 
     see what would happen, but there was no change.  The AC shut off like 
     usual and the fuse looked OK (not blown).  I'm hoping there's some 
     standard way they rewire these for the after-market compressor so I 
     can find where to look.  Third, when it shuts off, there is no current 
     going to the switch.
     
     Can anyone help shed some light on this?  I'd like to find the fuse 
     and also how to get to the wires elsewhere in the circuit to test 
     them.  If anybody has spent time troubleshooting the electrical system 
     and can offer some hints I'd appreciate it.
     
     
     TIA
