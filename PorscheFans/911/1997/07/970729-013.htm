Collyer,

I too have a 88 Carrera Cabriolet and about 8 months ago I put  in a Pioneer
CD player (DEH-425) with a  detachable face.  It is a great stereo but there
were 2 problems with it:  1) The detachable faceplate was a pain and many
times I would forget to pop it off and hide it or take it with me (this
would not have been a problem in a coup - but in the summer my top is always
down).  2) It didn't have the CD changer on the faceplate ( I would have to
buy a FM modulator to get a CD changer in my system).

So I looked around and found a Kenwood CD head unit (KDC-7007) that when
powered off, the faceplate flips and hides its self (it looks like you have
already taken the faceplate off).  It also has the CD changer controls on
the faceplate so you can add a Kenwood CD changer.  It also has disk naming
so you don't have to remember what disk is in what slot - but you also need
a CD changer that has disk naming for it to work.  For the money I would get
a 10 disk changer ( I like my old music and its nice to add new music with
out pulling out my old stuff).
You can check it out on Kenwood web site at:
http://www.kenwoodusa.com/catalog/index.html and go to car audio.  

The Pioneer did have more power (although the Kenwood says it has the same)
the Pioneer did play louder.  I still have the Pioneer (in the box with the
books) if any one wants to buy if for $175. 

As far as the 3 sets of speakers go -  the big trick is to find a tweeter
that will fit in a flush mount 1 inch hole.  I got a MB-QUART 5/8 inch (I
think that size is correct) and I still had to file down the mounting rings
to install it.  The other 2 are 5 1/4 and 4 inches.  I went with MB-QUART
because 3 of the 4 car stereo shops I called said they were the best.  And
they are made in Germany.  A 10 inch SUB in the trunk also sounds nice. 
Because the 3 speakers are all small you lack the big punch a sub will give
you.

I don't know about the Blaupunkt Reno SQR-54.  I pulled my Blaupunkt because
it shorted out every time I touched the volume.
