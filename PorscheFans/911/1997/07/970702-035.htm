"I had talked to a couple of BWM instructors who were behind him when he wen=
t 
off.  The consensus is that he early apexed turn 4 with too much power on th=
e 
exit, dropped the two left wheels into the dirt at the exit of this right 
hander, and instead of "driving" it off like we've all been told he jerked t=
he

de 
ended with him dragging to....." 
 
Don't want to start a war here and I don't have all the facts but there is 
more to the story than this version that makes it sound like the driver did 
something really dumb......there was a BMW Club instructor in the car at the=
 
time of the incident....and some question as to who did what with the steeri=
ng 
wheel...the car and driver ran at LS several weeks before at a PCA time tria=
l 
and did quite well.  Please understand that I'm not trying to point a 
finger.....this incident took place a while back and is apparently resolved 
financially......I'm only trying to point out that there may be more to the 
story than you've put forth and we shouldn't be quick to assume the driver d=
id 
something stupid all by himself....... 
 
Ted 
Driver, instructor, hoping intently that he never has to make a real quick 
decision in a TT that a someone else is driving  on a track...
