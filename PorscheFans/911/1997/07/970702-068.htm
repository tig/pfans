If you don't have the shop manual (I don't) pick up a copy of the Haynes 
manual, it describes this procedure fairly well.  You first need to get the 
bearing cap off.  I find a large screwdriver and a hammer work well.  Beat 
around the circumference slowly and it will eventually come off.  Then get 
a long Allen wrench and loosen the Allen bolt that locks the U shaped nut 
onto the strut spindle.  Now you should be able to see a large washer 
behind the nut.  If not wipe away some of the grease.  You want to tighten 
the nut so that it is difficult, but possible to move this washer by 
pressing against it with a flat blade screwdriver.  I know this sounds very 
vague but that's also what the shop manual tells you (I have been told).  
Then before you put the bearing cap back on put you wheel back on and 
tighten it down with 2 or 3 lugnuts.  Grab the outside edges of your tire 
and wiggle it and feel for movement.  There should be none.  You may feel 
movement through the tie rod and steering box, but that feels totally 
different than what a loose bearing feels like.  If it feels OK take off 
wheel and put bearing cap back on and your done.  If you still  feel 
movement tighten down the U-bolt a bit more and repeat.  If you get to a 
point that you have cranked down on that U-bolt as tight as you dare and 
you are still getting some movement you may need new bearings.

Good luck!

What are some techniques that are used when tightening front wheel hub and
bearings?  How do you tighten the nut enough, but not too much also?  I 
know
you want to eliminate the axial movement in the hub, but to what extent, it
seems to be a pretty fine line??

Thanks for you help.....
