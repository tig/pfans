Hello,

A man created this post and sent it to everyone.  Then I replied to man. 
Then the listserve sent my message to everyone.  Now I am the man, kindof. 
Except for the fact that when I subscribed to this listserve, it told me to
hit "reply to all" when replying to a message on this listserve.

But none of that matters anyway, because I get "Unsubscribed" about once a
week anyway, which leads me to believe that there is a bigger, more
invasive man controlling the listserve.  I think it is a conspiracy.

Anyway, I just like Porsches, and I hate that every time I look at my mail
my reply is sitting there, en masse.  I guess it bothered some guy named
Doug too, because he sent me email thanking me for "contributing to the
madness".

 I didn't mean to make old Dougie mad, so I hereby apologize for doing what
I was told to do when I first subscribed to this listserve (even though I
get UNsubscribed once a week now).

I'm telling you, it's a conspiracy.

Paco Ahlgren

p.s. -- I think Doug may have been involved.  I think he may know something
about JFK and aliens too, but I'm not saying anything else.

p.s. (again) -- I feel sorry for the guy who initiated this whole thing.  I
also feel sorry for G.P.R.  If anyone knows their address, I'm probably
going to send them a box of chocolates and a case of motor oil.
