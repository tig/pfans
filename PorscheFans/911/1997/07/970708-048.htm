     All,
     I recently switched my 1980 911SC to Mobil 1 and I had the same bad 
     experience that I had with my 1966 GT-350, namely excessive leaks, and 
     it started burning oil like crazy.  (Everytime I rev the 911's motor, 
     a huge puff of blue smoke comes out).  Anyways, I chalked the oil 
     problem in the Shelby (~3500 miles on the engine) up to the fact that 
     I have forged pistons and the oil control isn't as good as with cast 
     pistons.  I switched back to conventional oil and the fouling problem 
     went away.
     
     The problem that I am having in my 911 is that it still appears to be 
     burning oil after switching back to conventional oil.  I drove it 
     about 15 miles at pretty high RPMs to try to "clean out" the engine.  
     So far, it still burns oil, and after it sits for a while (30 
     minutes), it idles really rough (almost dying) until I drive it a few 
     miles.  Could the plugs be getting oil fouled? 
     
     I also notice puffs of smoke coming out of the oil fill tube as it is 
     running when I am checking the oil.  Is this normal?  Could I have a 
     bad valve?  It was running perfectly before the oil swap.  Could I 
     have fouled some kind of sensor (O2 sensor)?
     
     Anyone have any advice, similar experiences? 
     
     Thanks for any and all help,
     Alex
