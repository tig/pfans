Todd, you want to call either public relations at PCNA or FAX a request
to Ina Schlegl at Porsche. Her Zuffenhausen FAX # is 711 911 6245. Be
sure to put the country code for Germany [49] in front. However, DON'T
mention that you are taking delivery of a non-Porsche <g>.

Last month, I had a factory tour (advance reservations only) and it was
fantastic. I will be posting a long (1400 word) description in two
weeks. The highlight of the visit was seeing the new 996. This was not
part of the scheduled tour, but incredible luck on my part because the
test driver left it parked outside.

The reason for the article's delay is that my company is downsizing
(i.e., my division is being eliminated lock, stock & barrel) and I have
to start job hunting. I should have time to finish the article in 2
weeks or so.

If you have specific questions, e-mail me at my home <fagaly@mill.net>.
If you're in the San Diego Area, I've got some really nice photos.
