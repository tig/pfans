> Of course, my nagging question is why the points self-destructed in  the first place.  It happens every 2 years or so, and seems to be tied 
 to contaminated FI.  This time, as the last, both have needed 
 attention. We're getting this crappy gas in CA that doesn't help  
 either. They're pushing it in Denver now, I read, and if not stopped it 
 will spread, like low-flow toilets, regardless of whether it's needed 
or even whether it does more good than harm.  Oh well.
 
IMHO, your point problem isn't related to the fuel system on those cars.
Points should last a year or more, but replacing them every 24 months
isn't too out of line. Points fail from rubbing block wear and high 
current flow in switching the coil on and off. Point surfaces can
fail prematurely from oil mist inside the distributor or other 
contamination on the contacts.

Your "point" out the state of the fuel we buy  is a very good one 
indeed. This is a nationwide issue and not just confined to one state or 
another. Many cities have been listed by the EPA as not conforming to 
the Clean Air Act and therebore those areas have been sentenced to use
either Re-formulated Gasoline or Oxygenated fuel, or both. Either way
certain fuel injection and carbureted systems have a very tough time 
coping with the chemical makeup of this stuff. This fuel recipe 
basically makes most cars run leaner. Porsches that use an oxygen sensor
are better equipped to adapt to the fuel makeup. CIS systems without a
feedback system do not do very well with this brew. 

Several years ago, a company called Downstream Alternatives published
a booklet called, "Changes in Gasoline II". This is a book for the auto
technician trade that deals with this subject in detail. Technical it 
nature, it describes the different fuel combinations and their 
different characteristics and effects. Our upcoming Web site will have
excerpts from this publication. I will post the URL when this happens.
There isn't an inexpensive solution to this problem. The use of Ethanol
and MTBE as oxygenates really forces Porsche owners to focus good 
prevenatative maintenance on the entire fuel system. Failure to do so 
will result in the purchase of some mighty expensive components for 
their cars!!.
I've just barely scratched the surface of this entire issue here. The
need for fuel additives and awareness of the potential problems could 
fill a volume. Stay tuned :^)
