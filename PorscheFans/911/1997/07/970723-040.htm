Steve, I really hate to burst your bubble, but I don't think you should buy
a Porsche in your situation.  It's kind of like the old saying about the
Rolls... if you have to ask, you can't afford it.  It will eat you alive,
as will any sports car.  I had a Corvette when I was 18, and that thing
just about killed me financially (and otherwise, but that's a different
story).

Buy a Toyota, get a good job, and save your money till you can afford to
blow three or four grand or so a year on maintenance and insurance without
having to agonize over it.

Good luck (because I bet you'll go ahead and get one anyway...),
