Well, I just came back up from my garage.  Here's the latest on my paint
prep project.

I've removed:

ALL exterior chrome/aluminum trim pieces (minus the targa SS cover). 

ALL weatherstripping/rubber trim pieces.

Headlights, parking light assys.

The rear bumpers and license panel are off the car as well.  Here's what
I've got planned.  I was going to have a friend who works at a
windshield shop come over and help me pull the front and, UGH, the rear
targa windshield.  But I think I'm going to let the paint shop handle
them.  I'm scared they may crack or chip and then I'll be in trouble if
I remove them.  

I'd like to remove the targa bar SS cover, but I think that I need to


remove the rear windshield first, right??  I want to get the targa
scripts off of it so I can add them to my pile of trim pieces I plan to
get powder coated.

I still need to remove one fender to undercoat it.  Then I'll reattach
it.  I plan to drive the car over to a local shop to get an estimate in
its stripped condition.  If I'm not happy with theyre estimate, I'll be
able to drive it to another shop.  This way I won't have to deal with a
tow truck.  I think that the shop I plan to go to also will increase the
estimate if they see that I towed the car there.  

I'm thinking that I should save around 20 hrs of labor based on some
detailed estimates from two shops I don't plan to go with.  Even if I
don't save much, at least now I know the job will be done right.

Oh, I still need to remove the leftover adhesive from the
weatherstripping.  I will use the 3m adhesive cleaner.  Any suggestions
on what to use to scrape off the adhesive??  I think some kind of hard
plastic scraper would work best.

I think I've got an aftermarket trunk lid installed on my car and I'm
still debating on whether to just use what I've got or get a factory
used hood.  About the only thing that bothers me with mine is that it
doesn't have the factory undercoating on the inside surface.  Can the
paint shop duplicate this??  Also, I'd like to get the beige
undercoating on the inside of my trunk reapplied.  Can most paint shops
recoat with the original beige undercoating??
