I am not a mechanic but my mechanic has installed a few procoolers.  The 
verdict is that the unit has gotten easier to install and now has proper 
fittings, the unit does not have a provision for a sight glass, makes topping 
off the system more difficult.  The system lowers the head pressure around 
25lbs which is ok. Vent tempatures lower only around 5-7 degrees, not the huge 
change claimed or noticed.  The local distributer/parts house who supplied the 
unit has sold 20 units and had 8 come back for customer dissatisfaction, to me 
this sounds pretty bad...  In South Florida the only way to make an early (pre 
C2-C4) a/c sytem more effective is to use the under car condenser. I believe 
that is produced by Performance Air in C.A..  I have sat in cars with the 
undercar condenser that have sat in the sun for a few hours and the a/c blew 
as cold as any 911 I have been in.  Despite the non-factory set-up underneath 
the car I think it is the only effective upgrade.
Good Luck in your cooling.
