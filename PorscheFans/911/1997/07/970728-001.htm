Hi Rich,
If my memory serves me correctly...and that remains to be
questioned...and I'm certainly not an expert on the Wittington boys,
but..they were big into IMSA racing back in the late 70's early
eighties.  They were, I believe, real estate guys from Georgia and
definitely owned Road Atlanta for a while.  I think Don's brother is
named Bill.  They were big friends of the Pauls (i.e. John Paul) who I
believe was from Lawrenceville, Ga.. Back then there was a lot of
questionable goings on with the Paul family, and I believe the
Wittington boys were always mentioned in the same breath.  I did some
driver schools back then when they owned the track and it was not in the
best of shape under their ownership.  I also believe either Don or Bill
had a fifth place Indy finish one year.  I am sketchy about Don's racing
career.  Hope this helps a bit.
