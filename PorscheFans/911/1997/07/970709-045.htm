        This is a great forum! I just bouyght a '85 911 Carrera. It has
been well taken are of and I'm going to continue the upkeep.
        One problem is the engine inslating pad, it was hanging when I
bought it and 3m adhesive didn't work. Should I get a new pad? Or is their
a better pad or adhesive?
        My heater dosen't blow hard, and there is no levers like I see in
the manual, in the heater box. Anyone know why this is so? Used to have a
KGhia and it had the same set up and that heater worked great.
        Having problems with my cruise control also. Dosen't want to
engage, but accelerates the car fine. Tried pressure on the pedal, but
still no cruise.

        Couple of performace questions, I want to increase my horsepower:
Chips, exhaust, wires. air filters, what THE most effective way to speed up
a fast car!

        My car sits real nice, low in the back, but I'd like to drop the
front about an inch, how do I do it?

        Thanks for all replies!
