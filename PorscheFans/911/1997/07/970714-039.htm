If one were to create a list of most significant Porsches based upon
the amount of design work that went into the creation of the car, the 
964 would probably be on the list and not the 993.  A subjective list 
of a small size that tries to include the most significant models  will
most certainly omit many examples of cars that are significant for
one reason or another.  The list of ten is just to short, I can think of
at least ten significant 911 variations.  

It would be nice if the 964 was accepted as a fine evolution of the last
911 model prior to  evolution into the 993, but I would not count on it.
Look at the example of the 1974 thru 1977 911 and 911S.
The '74 was a year of significant change for the look of the 911, a look
that lasted till the 964. Most uninitiated couldn't tell a '74 from an
'88.
All USA bound 74's had a fuel injection that was to become the standard
for all to follow till '84. They are only slightly heavier than the
previous year
and have the same HP and more torque than the 911E.  They must have 
been well received at the time or significantly inexpensive because
Porsche
sure sold a lot of them. Certainly there are some significant examples
of great cars built in those years, but ask anyone if they want a plain
'77 911S 
or a '78 SC?  Everyone says "SC please".  There are some very desirable 
964 based cars (RS America, Turbo, Carrera Cup),  but in ten or fifteen
years
ask the question - 964 C2 or 993 C2?  I think you know the answer.
I look forward to being able to afford to purchase a used 964 much
sooner
because of this attitude.
