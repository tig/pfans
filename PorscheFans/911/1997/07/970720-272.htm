        I'm  sure Matt , when the time came for you to get involved with
Porsche  you were probibly the kind of guy who wanted to get one cheep, fix
it up cheep and then boast about how cheeply you accquired your Cheep
Porsche.  After all with this many cheeps in any manufactured  car the end
result is usually the same, A cheep car.

        In sted of quitting the marbles game because you were loosing when
you were a kid, or maybe you're still a kid.  You should have gone home and
researched Porsche.  Porsche Parts availibility, vehicle costs new and ten
years later. Basic labor rate at any given Porsche dealer.

        You would have soon found out that this is a unique car maker.
You may have found out that all parts aren't allways in supply, new or used.
  
        Some commen sence might have told you  that as a production 901
moves on and wears out the 911 design and parts will change and  into
somting new and better.  This is being Porsche minded.  

        I'm sure some where someone is trying to rebuild a 356,  he or she
needs patients and a little luck, not to mention money.  You can be sure the
when a rare part is found, the part will be sold and the buyer will be happy
reguardless off the cost.

        When thier task of building or restoring thier Porsche is completed,
they will be truely Porsche Minded.  Thier Porsche of course will not be a
cheep Porsche put together with cheep ideas or fantisies about what any
given part is worth. 

        Lastley Matt,  you seem juvenile as the your  rude posting display.
Ask your self, "How is the next Porsche Parts House going to react when they
hear my name ?"  After all Porsche Fans goes into a lot of Places. I hope
some day when you grow up you'll be truely Porsche Minded and know what that
really means.
