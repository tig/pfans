Steve,

From the updated-FAQ-to-be (a message originally from Bob Brewer):


> Oh, this is a fun job.
> 
> Remove the rear window chrome trim.
> 
> Remove the black sealant around the base of the targa band, exposing the
> screws, remove screws.
> 
> From inside the fender well, remove 2 nuts on each side securing the
> band.
> 
> I don't recall if there were nuts or bolts holding the band that are
> hidden under the interior trim, piece, but you can remove the trim piece
> by removing the screws and pushing it toward the rear of the car.  I
> think.


And, from Jeff Shorey:


> I just encountered this very same problem a few weeks ago on my new
> winter restoration project.  I assume you found the 4 10mm nuts under
> the fenders and the 15-odd screws on the fore side of the bar.  What you
> don't know is that underneath the bar, all around the inner metal
> structure, is foam padding.  This padding acquires adhesive-like
> properties after 20 years or so.  Solution: heat it up!  In this case, I
> got out my little propane torch (this may seem barbaric, but it works)
> and heated up the front part of the bar (it's stainless steel, so
> nothing is going to hurt it).  Actually, it didn't take a whole lot of
> heat to get it loose.  Pull forward on the bar (don't burn yourself) and
> you should feel it starting to slip and loosen.  Wiggle it back and
> forth until it breaks fully free, pull the bar forward and lift the
> studs out of the holes in the fender.  The foam strip is on the front
> edge of the bar (the horizontal edge, not the vertical), right at the 90
> degree bend.  There is also a cloth buffer strip a couple of inched from
> the back of the bar.


Hope this helps!
