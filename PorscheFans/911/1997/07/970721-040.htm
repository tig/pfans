Hi, all,

Well, I've wanted to send this for a while now, but have hesitated hoping
that "things will get better".

Apparantly they won't.

We again have a situation where the PorscheFans mail server is causing
messages to be repeated ad nauseum (this is NOT the fault of those who
originally authored the repeating messages). Perhaps the only blessing in
this is that the subscription lists are likely still very small because
of LAST week's problem.

I'm not flaming the list admins - we are getting a free service and I'm
sure the admins have paying customers they need to take care of as well.
We are getting what we pay for - no more, no less.

But... for those of you who are not overly familiar with mailing lists,
what we are seeing is **NOT** normal. The PorscheFans lists have been
continually innundated with problems FAR greater than most lists I have
been on or have managed.

Ok - here goes - no beating around the bush. Who is interested in moving
the PorscheFans lists to a different site with the potential of reducing
the volume of problems?

Ideally, a home could be found for all (7? 8?) PFans lists and the web
site (which could and should be expanded). If appropriate, I could and
would donate my time AND computer hardware (if I have enough disk, etc...)
to the effort.

Now the iffy part and the reason why I haven't expressed these sentiments
before... regardless of whether the list admin function comes for free (as
it would, for instance, if I were permitted to administer the lists),
maintaining a connection to the 'net costs money on a continuing basis. I
wish I had a high-speed Internet connection that I could just run this
from, but I don't...

I don't want to bring up the P******ph*** word, but ex-philes will know
what I'm thinking.

I know lots of you out there would willingly pay a few $$$ to get things
running more smoothly. I also know that paying on a continuing basis is
a tough thing - perhaps unreasonable - to expect from people.

Does anyone have any other thoughts or ideas? I'm sure I'm not the only
one interested in somehow improving our service...

How 'bout vendors out there? Would you be interested in spending a few
$$$ for list maintenance in return for some ad space on the web server?

Cheers,

Ross
