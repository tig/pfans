Hello all,
    I have a question about the air pump on early SC models. When I bought my 
car, the belt that drives the air pump was not on the engine. I asked the 
previous owner about this and he said that his mechanic told him to leave it 
off, that this gave the engine more power. He also said that when he took it 
through emissions it passed without it until they did the visual inspection 
(which they no longer do in WI). I thought that this car felt more powerful 
than any of the other SC's that I had driven but just figured that it had 
something to do with the great shape that the car was in. Well, I just had to 
take the car through emissions testing, so I put the belt on it. I didn't 
really expect much of a difference. I couldn't believe the effect! The car 
felt like a dog. It felt much, much slower. The engine wouldn't rev nearly as 
quickly, and acceleration was terrible. It was nowhere near what it was 
without the belt installed. With the air pump working, the power band was much 
different. It would slowly accelerate until about 4800 rpm, where the engine 
would speed up very quickly, but not seeming to produce much more power. Also, 
the engine did not sound as good. On an interesting note, the car passed the 
emissions test with the belt installed. In fact, they ran the test twice 
because they said that they had never seen a car go through and measure so 
clean. That really surprised me.
    So, what are the effects on the engine by not keeping the air pump hooked 
up? Is it hurting the engine in any way? What does everyone else do?
    If it does not hurt the engine to leave the belt off, then I would suspect 
that any other SC owners out there who still have it hooked up would be in for 
an inexpensive power boost. I really could not believe the difference that it 
made.

Regards,
