I've got a 97 C4S that has the factory "motor sound" package. This package
consists of louder mufflers that seem to have some baffles removed for
loudness and no more power. The cover of the air cleaner cover has extra
holes drilled in it and a chromed plastic intake so that you hear more
induction noise (no performance gain). I also have the stainless steel
muffler tips. The muffler sounds nice, but the I've taped shut the extra
air cleaner holes because they cause a very obnoxious resonance at about
5000 RPM that sounds like you have your head in a 100 gallon drum. You
can't hear it outside of the car though. If I had to choose again, I would
not get this package. Rather I would get the B&B sport mufflers which sound
just as good (or better) and may produce a little extra horsepower.

I just installed a K&N air filter and this may help with performance and
certainly does't hurt. There is no difference in sound.
