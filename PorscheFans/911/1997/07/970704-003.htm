Some info and a question-
Sorry to bring up old topic, but a while back some were asking about radio
performance etc.  Just finished installing a Sony CDX760 & amp in my '89 930,
along with Infinity speakers.  Their CS50 model fits into the existing door
panels, including crossovers in place of factory ones, and you can use the
factory mounts and grills.
All works and sounds great.
Now the question-there is a connection to the factory radio which is
apparently at 12V unswitched, and goes to a tab on the radio mounting bracket
which sits against an insulator when the radio is installed, but grounds to
the radio chassis when you slide it partway out.  Anyone know what this is
for?  Part of alarm system?  Thanks-
Larry
