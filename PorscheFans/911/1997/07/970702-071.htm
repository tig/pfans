Fans-
	I thought I'd share my experience fixing the odometer and trip odometer in
my '71 911T. From what I understand, they can be easily broken by resetting
the odometer while the car is moving.
	The bezel is hard to get off, but a large flat screwdriver gently pried
around the edge many, many times will do the job. Once inside, Walt is right,
it is somewhat complicated. I eventually found a pressed on gear that was not
turning with the shaft. I used Krazy Glue, and everything works again. This
was only a few months ago, so I don't know how long it will last. It
cerrtainly was a lot cheaper than replacement, or even sending it out. It
took me too many hours to mention, but our labor is always free, right?
