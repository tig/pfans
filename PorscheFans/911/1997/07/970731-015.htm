Jeff,

>Anyone had a front suspension pan replaced on an early 70's 911 lately? I need
>to have mine replaced. I guess battery leakage in the past has taken its toll.
>I will have a body shop perform the work. What is involved? What is a
>reasonable
>price to pay for such work? Is OEM part necessary? Are other parts comparable?
>What is a fair price for the front pan? Are there any other parts on the A-arm
>assembly that should be inspected/replaced?

   I really can't help you with any of the specifics of your question, but
I am writing to tell you about a book ithat you may not know of.  It is by
Haynes, but is not the usual manual.  It is called something like "Porsche
911: Guide to Purchase and DIY Restoration."  One of the authors is Dean
Batchelor.  I got it at my local Barnes and Noble or Border's (can't
remember).

  It has extensive sections on "rustoration."  It shows the process of
cutting out the old pan and welding in a new one.  I think it would
definitely be worthwile to have even though you won't be doing the work
yourself.

HTH,
