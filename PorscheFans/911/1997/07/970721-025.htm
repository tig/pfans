Joe -

As you've probably guessed, the excessive wear on the insides of your front
tires can be due to high negative camber or maybe toe-out.  I'd bet on the
negative camber, since a lot of toe-out makes the car drive funny - kind of
floaty - and you'd notice something was amiss.

The negative camber is supposed to make the car corner better, at the expense
of tire wear.  Some clubs limit the amount of negative camber that you can
run in a particular racing class.  So if you plan to race, you might check
into your local provisions and instruct the shop how to set the camber.

The turbo tie rods can also bump you up in racing class.

You should go to a shop that is experienced with Porsches.  Not too many cars
are as adjustable as ours, especially in the rear.

Cheers,

- Brad
