 I built a 2.7 race motor, and had flywheel bolts come loose (same
symptom Glen had - one worked out far enough to hit clutch disc so it
felt
like clutch wasn't fully disengaging) with a later style flywheel.  This
is
bad news, as in one case metal transferred from crank to steel flywheel,

ruining end of crank.  Next time it  happened with new crank (I thought
I
just hadn't tightened enough somehow) metal mostly transferred from
cast iron flywheel to crank, and its end could be machined smooth again,

although it had to come out to do it.  Both flywheels junk, of course.

.......some good stuff deleted....

2) Word is that the 4th order harmonic of the 70.4 crank is at a high
point
right at the flywheel mating surface, which means they want to shake
the flywheel off even when everything is perfectly balanced. ...

Mores stuff deleted...

   On stock engines this isn't really a problem if properly assembled.
When I
ran a stock 2.7, probably not entirely properly assembled, the flywheel
stayed on with a redline of 7000.  This flywheel problem drove factory
nuts on their race engines running at 8000 or maybe more.  Rumor is
they put in new bolts every day (night, more likely).  One guy tack
welded the bolts.  Didn't work.  People have tried dowel pinning, and
wedge mating.  The books say the factory tried a harmonic damper.

*****************

Walter et al,
One thing to consider is the stock Flywheel bolts have a lot of
clearance with the holes in the Flywheel so the only thing resisting the
vibrational torque is friction between the flywheel and the crankshaft
mating surface. This is a problem at extended RPM if everything isn't
mated up perfectly! As soon as you have motion, you mess up that
"perfect" interface and it gets worse...as you noted about the material
transfer from the flywheel to the crank.
And then the motion of the flywheel relative to bolts allows them, or
maybe a better description is, causes them to back out and loosen up!!
So The CAUSE of the bolts backing out is flywheel vibration relative to
the Crank/Bolts, the EFFECT is the bolts back out, (they can't resist!)
and rub on the clutch disk, that's when you finally notice the damage!

One solution that apparently works is to dowel pin the Flywheel to the
Crankshaft so that there is no opportunity for motion between these
parts. This comes form an old 911 racer
Ralph Meaney, who finished second in class at Daytona in 1970 driving a
privately entered 911.
Increasing the torque of the fastening bolts is potentially a bad
solution , the torque spec take into account the variation in material
allowed by the specification, so you don't know how close you are to the
elastic limit when you over torque these bolts, and you can potentially
make it worse, i.e.. reduce your clamping force.
Locktite only stops the bolts from backing out, it doesn't prevent any
motion between the Flywheel and Crank flange. Again as soon as there is
motion, the bolts will back out!

If you can reduce the clearance between the Bolt's diameter and the
Flywheel holes to zero then you have a solution. Maybe our friends at
Raceware should make Flywheel Bolts, and a reamer kit!! Boltmeister
where are you?
