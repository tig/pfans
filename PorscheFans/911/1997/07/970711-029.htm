Steve Iverson says he took apart his '90 3.6 too quickly, and wants to
know which of two green with stripes wires goes to which of the two
terminals on his oil pressure sender.  I would be so bold as to hazard a
guess that one of these is the pressure sender terminal, and the other is
a built-in idiot light terminal.  Were I at home I'd look at the wiring diagrams
for Scs and earlier cars I have, as these color codes tend to stay
somewhat the same.  Were I he (and had no books for diagrams) I'd pull
out the gauges in the dash and look at what color stripe is on the green
wire connected to the pressure gauge, and on the idiot light.  With luck
the wires don't change their stripes, so to speak, at the various
connectors along the way.  Could also just hook them up and see if
these two functions work properly, and if not, reverse.  This can't hurt
the idiot light (the sender is just a contact to ground which opens under
pressure), although I can't say for sure if it might not put more charge
than desired through the gauge (I think the gauge will withstand a direct
lead to ground, but not certain).  If you hook an ohmeter up to these
contacts on the gauge you should be able to figure out which is the idiot
light - it should show  zero resistance between the contact and the body
of the sender.  Plus, if engine is in car, it should show infinite resistance
when the engine is running.  The gauge terminal will show some
resistance with the engine off, with (if memory serves) increasing
resistance as the pressure builds.  Perhaps someone with a 3.6 will do
more than theorize for you, though.
