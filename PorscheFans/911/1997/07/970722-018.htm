I have a 77 2.7S in my '73 911T.  I eneded up putting on an external oil 
cooler.  If your temps. are really never going over 220, then all I would 
recommend is going to synthetic oil (Mobil 1, etc..) and leave it at that.  
But unless you are fairly easy on the engine when you drive and live in a 
cold climate I would be suprised that you don't see much higher temps than 
220.  As far as your oil pressure you should see at least 50 at 5000 rpm 
with a warm/hot engine.  You should only see less than 20 when the engine 
is warm/hot and at idle or very low rpm.  If you are seeing less than 20 at 
5000rpm that's a very bad thing indeed.  I would verify your engine oil 
temp. gauge first off and then go from there.

Good luck!

Hi,  
I posted a message regarding the engine temp. and oil pressure of my 74-2.7 
on the wkend. Didn't 
see any comments, probably do to the list crash, so here goes again.
I was under the impression that operating temps of 210-220 deg. and slowly 
dropping oil pressure 
from the 65 area to 20 or below( due, I assume to the oil thinning at 
higher temps)was relatively 
normal. I have been driving my 74-911 for five years and get it serviced by 
a porsche shop. I 
queried the mechanic about these conditions when I first bought the car and 
was given the 
impression that this was how the motor operated.After scanning the list 
last week I'm not so sure 
that these conditions are normal. The engine seems to operate smoothly and 
much to my satisfaction  
but now Im concerned that I may be doing damage.
feedback would be most welcome.

Thanks
John
