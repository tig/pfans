James,

Rust in the fuel tank can cause the problems you are refuring to.  I 
would check that first.  I have found my Webers very reliable.

Take Care,
Ken

>      Last year,after a long term body restoration (7 years), I had
>      the 2.4l engine and Weber carbs in my '73 911T rebuilt.  I've
>      put a total of 3,000 miles on the car since then.
> 
>      I've experienced several problems with the carbs - ranging from
>      lean miss sputtering up to running on 5 cylinders below 3,000
>      RPM.  My engine rebuilder has worked with me to increase the
>      idle circuit jets and eliminate the sputtering but the
>      non-functioning idle circuit problem keeps coming back.  At
>      this point it looks like one has some dirt in it.  A new fuel
>      pump and filter were installed at rebuild, and a new fuel
>      filter was installed at about 2,500 miles.
> 
>      Shear distance between the engine rebuilder and myself prevent
>      me from going back to him often - the flat haul rate runs into
>      the low $400 range one way.
> 
>      My questions are:
> 
>      1.  Are the Weber carbs that finicky?  What should I expect? 
>      Is a once a year tune up enough or do they need attention every
>      time the weather changes by 10 degrees F?
> 
>      2.  Are there any good Weber carb guys out there in Southern
>      Indiana that anyone can suggest?
> 
>      I prefer posts to the 911@proschefans.com list rather than
>      direct email.  Seems like there is better info sharing that
>      way.
> 
>      Thanks for your help.
