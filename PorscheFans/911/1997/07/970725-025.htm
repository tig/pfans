Yup, the answer SEEMS to be an easy one...

DO NOT post individually to all of the PorscheFans lists.

While nobody is 100% sure of the mechanism involved (we have our
educated guesses and suspicions), both times where we've had the
dreaded 'repeat message' problem seem to have been prompted by
people posting to ALL 8 PorscheFans lists in the same message.

Posting to 'all@porschefans.com' is entirely safe and is the CORRECT
way to do this.

Cheers!
