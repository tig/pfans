Ray,

Thanks alot for the info, but why are oil changes such a 
nightmare (in the 993)?

The car has two oil filters; one in the right-rear fender, another at the
bottom
of the engine. This is a change from the old 911's; from what I have heard,
it was 
necessary to keep the hydraulic lifters happy with the 15,000 mile oil 
change interval Porsche has used for years.

Procedure largely is:
  -       Jack up right rear
  -       Remove tire 
  -       Remove inner fender liner
  -       Remove rocker panel cover (totally) 
  -       Reinstall tire and lower car
  -       Drain oil tank in right rear fender (have to get jack out of way
since
          oil drain plug is right above jack location)
          ****WARNING: Plug is 15mm hex and is ALUMINUM; I recommend
           using only a 6-point 15mm socket****
  -       Jack up car again & remove wheel
  -       Remove oil filter, replace with new one
  -       Remove oil plug at engine (tight fit with left-side heater air
bypass 
         duct right near plug), clean plug & reinstall
  -       Under right-rear side of car, remove the right-side heater air
bypass 
           metal duct (hose clamps connect it to rubber duct)
  -        Using a clamp-style filter wrench, remove engine oil filter
(Circular 
          wrenches that fit over entire end of filter won't fit in cramped
space),
           install new filter & replace duct
  -        Lower engine, refill with approx. 9 qts of oil
  -        Start engine, let warm up, then top off oil level 

Have done this twice; hasn't gotten much easier with time.  Recommend
the factory filters, and get the aluminum crush washers for the two drain
plugs.  if you need a laugh, might want to call a dealer & ask him for a
price.

Another fun job I have heard is the no. 4 spark plug change (right front top
side
of engine); it's buried by the power steering pump which apparently has to 
come out.  Haven't done this yet; plan to do it at 30,000 miles.
