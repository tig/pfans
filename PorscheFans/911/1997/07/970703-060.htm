Re: Colin O'Keefe's query about Goodyear GS-Cs: I have them on my '87, size 
205/55-16 fr., 225/50-16 r. I like them a lot. They were on the car when I 
bought it last Sept., and were brand new then. I've since put about 6,800 
miles on them plus one driver education event at Heartland Park and do not 
see any appreciable wear (car has recently checked factory alignment settings).

They ride pretty stiff, but are quite sensitive to pressure in that respect. 
I keep them at 30 to 32 psi front and 38 to 40 psi rear and am satisfied 
with their ride characteristics, though there are probably softer riding 
tires around. As far as handling goes, they're great on the street and very 
good on the track (for street tires). Wet weather traction is just okay. On 
the track, they were very forgiving of my ham-fisted driving and exhibited 
very progressive break away characteristics. Track pressures were 32/38, 
with no sidewall rollover.

I've never been a big fan of Goodyears, but overall, I highly recomend the 
GS-Cs. Of course, I haven't tried any other tires on the car as yet so I 
can't compare them to anything else on a 911. Oh yeah, they also look great!
