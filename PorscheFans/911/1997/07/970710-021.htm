Buddy,
There are a number of brands of amplifiers that will accept "speaker level"
inputs.  I personally only have experience with a Rockford Fosgate Power 300
amp.  I believe this company is somehow tied to Hafler for home systems.  This
amp, is not in my 911, has been very reliable and durable.  I bought it
origanally for my Supra Targa, which had the same symptoms you expressed.   I
used it to power 2  channels (left and right, paralleled front (4 ohms) and
back (8 ohms) and a pair of 10" subwoofers.  This is a substantial amount of
power (300 watts)  and I have not put this amp in the Porsche because I do not
want to load the electrical system (35-50 amps continous).  If you are not
running subwoofers, you won't need as much power.  
I suggest getting something in a 4 channel ~40watt per channel amplifier. 
Stick with a "Name Brand"  like Alpine, Kenwood, etc....( and there are
Numerous others)

The MOSFET type of amplifiers are considered to be generally higher quality,
although, as such will cost more.  i.e. my retailed when new for $999.
It is worth going to a coouple of high end stereo stores and just asking them,
find one that has experience with Porsches.  Personally I like Leo's here in
Torrance, cuz the owner drives a 993 and uses it to try out all the gadgets. 
They also have a lot of experience with Porsches.
