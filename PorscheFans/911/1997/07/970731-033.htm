I too picked up a 72 T that hadn't run in a long time.  Same symptoms.
	To fix it, I 
	1.  pulled the fuel tank and had it relined - didn't help but it was
flaking inside so it didn't hurt.
	2.  replaced all fuel line, most of it crumbled in my hands as I pulled
on it.
	3.  replaced fuel filter, clogged with old tank and fuel lines.
	4.  dismantled electric fuel pump and reassembled with new o-rings in
place of the round black powdery crap left from the old ones.
	5. THIS IS THE BIG ONE - sent fuel injection pump to Pacific Fuel
Injection for a $700 rebuild

	After the rebuild, it worked great.  Hot, cold, warm, slow, fast, targa
top on or off - that old car is wonderful.

	Now, I want perfection so I am going to have the throttle bodies
rebuilt to even out the idle and low throttle.

	Otherwise, all problems are cured.

	Separate advise would be to pull the rear cam chain covers and take a
look at the tensioners and plastic chain guides. I had the old style
guides in mine. One day, a guide gave it up and took the chain with it.
Luck was with me and no other damage was done, but the newer guides are
much better, and all eight are now the new type.  It only takes one time
to learn that lesson. I put new standard tensioners with guards in, and
it seems fine.

	Of course, the new paint job doesn't hurt either.

Good luck,

Brendan
