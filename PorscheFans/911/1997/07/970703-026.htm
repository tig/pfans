Thought I'd throw my $.02 into this Radar Detector dialogue.
Radar detectors are not the 'magic bullet' many would have you believe 
they are. 
1.Everyone I talk to seems to agree that if you are zapped by 'photo 
radar' you cannot slow down fast enough to avoid being nailed. They 
spend all their energy concocting ways to beat the ticket in court.  
2.Super wide band and 360 degree sweeps are only effective if the radar 
is left on or pointed at a car ahead of you. If the cop is 'gunning' 
each car with short bursts, and you're up front... you're toast.
3.There does not seem to be very much difference between a $150.00 model 
and a $450.00 model. The game seems to be 'big cost step-ups' for little 
payback. All this hype-talk like 'bogeys' and 'stealth' etc. is meant to 
push buttons. You are speeding. A cop has a 'radar device'. If you get 
caught you either have to go through a very time consuming and 
convoluted process to fight it or pay. It's that simple.
Conclusion:
I'm not saying don't buy one... let's face it one ticket avoided is the 
price of admission. I'm saying don't get caught up in the 'bells and 
whistles' game.
$150.00-200.00 will give me:
*Wide band Laser with 360-degree scanning
*City/Highway modes with decent sensitivity.
*VG-2
 
I'm not sure I need much more.
