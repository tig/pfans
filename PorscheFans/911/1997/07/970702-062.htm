Folks,

Andy Warren and I have been talking offline about the proposed approach
to braking.  With Andy's permission, transcript follows:


------------ Ezra Goldman, responding to Richard Hocking writes:

Technique is about using the brakes less of the time but more intensely. 
Ask any instructor at the next event to chat/demonstrate some of that. 


------------ I write to Andy: -----------------------------

Does this make any sense to you?  Seems to me that, in a given lap,
you have to slow down x amount and the heat equivalent of that is
going into your brakes.  At the same time, you have exactly 1 lap
worth of cool air running over your brake system by whatever path is
allowed by your current setup.  Why would it be better (outside of
slightly better lap times) to brake short and hard rather than
somewhat longer and easier?


------------ Andy writes back: -----------------------------

This common advice has always mystified me, too... In fact, it seems
that if there's any difference between the two techniques, braking
more GENTLY for a LONGER time should heat the fluid less, by this
reasoning:

The same amount of heat energy is generated each way, of course, since
you're converting the same amount of kinetic energy to heat in each
case.  The difference is that, when you brake hard, the heat in the
rotors can rise faster and higher, since there isn't as much time for
it to be conducted, radiated, or convected away from the discs.

Assuming that we don't suddenly "shock" the discs and warp them ,we
only care about hot discs because they transfer their heat to the
brake fluid and boil it.  Take a wildly unrealistic example:  If the
discs reach a temperature of 2000 degrees for even one second, the
fluid will boil... But if they're kept at 100 degrees for a YEAR,
the fluid'll be fine.

Slow braking also lets air resistance, engine friction, and the
tires' rolling resistance perform more of the braking job, but their
contribution is relatively minor unless you're talking about REALLY
slow, REALLY gentle braking.

Of course, if you brake SO hard (on a non-ABS equipped car) that the
tires lock up, all the braking friction will be betwen the tire and
the road and the discs might not heat up at all.  I don't think this
is what anyone's suggesting, though...


------------ Then I write: -----------------------------

Well, I tried to figure out some way that there might be a non-linear
relationship between the temperature of a body and the ability of a 
stream of ambient air, flowing at a known rate, to dissipate energy 
from that body.  But what I come up with is that they only way you're
going to get to corner 2 with cooler brakes is to leave corner 1 with
cooler brakes, or wait longer until hitting the brakes (which is what
the advice implies), giving them a little longer to cool in the airstream
before you use them.  However, hunching a somewhat asymptotic 
cooling curve, seems like you're trading off limited cooling at the 
end of the straight (on the brake-hard-and-late approach) with cooling
while trying to raise the brake temperature (on the brake-earlier-and-
gentler approach); option B should be more effective in keeping the 
temp down, I think.  So I still can't see any merit, and now have two
notions against the approach recommended on the list.

------------ Andy responds: -----------------------------

    I agree, although as you know, this is contrary to the "popular
    wisdom".

    Maybe we're missing something... Does it help to consider all
    THREE ways (convection, radiation, and conduction) that heat can
    be dissipated?

    I don't know... Maybe we're making a mistake by concerning
    ourselves with the heat IN THE ROTOR; perhaps the only real
    issue is the heat in the caliper (and by extension, in the
    fluid). Can we trade higher temps in the rotor for cooler fluid,
    by only allowing heat to conduct out of the rotor into the
    caliper for a short period?  If so, maybe THAT's why the
    brake-hard-and-late approach is recommended.

    I'm too busy to think much about this now... If you come up with
    any breakthroughs, let me know.
 

------------ My response to this is: -----------------------------

Given that the heat is being generated at the interface between the
rotor and the pad surface and is presumably traveling to both the 
rotor and the caliper, and recognizing that there is some thermal 
resistance in the pads, I still don't see how the advocated approach
is going to achieve the proposed results.



Now, anyone want to get into the nitrogen in the tires issue?
