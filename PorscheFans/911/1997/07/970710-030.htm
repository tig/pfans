Just came back from Thunderhill (third track weekend) with the 993, and 
noticed a slight vibration at about 90 mph on the drive back to the Bay 
Area (vibes weren't there at 90 on the way up).  Got home and checked the 
tires, and noticed that both right tires had "deformed":  the outer-most 
tread blocks all had their leading edges curved upward!

I don't know what this condition is, so I'll call it "feathering" (is that 
the right name?)  I've never seen this condition before, and was wondering 
WHAT HAPPENED?  Also, is this a safe condition (I don't drive at 90 very 
much!) or should I get the two right tires replaced?

I've seen chunking before, and know this isn't it (isn't chunking caused by 
tires that are too new?).  The tires are OEM Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 (205/50 
and 255/40 x 17s) with 4000 miles on them, and they've been to two other 
track weekends with no problem, including another weekend at Thunderhill 
back in May.

Some other clues:  the track was fairly hot, as the air temps got to around 
100 degF.  Last time at TH I had good traction at 32 psi cold, so this time 
I started out at 31 cold, knowing that the track was going to be hotter 
than May.

The fifth (out of six) run session felt really greasy, the post-session hot 
pressures were up at 40 psi, and pyrometer indicated 140 deg on the outside 
third of the tires, with 160 deg middle and inside.  Since I run stock 
camber, I figured this meant the outside regions of the tires were still 
not working hard compared to middle and inside, so I aired down to 33 psi 
before the last session.  The last session felt much stickier, and the next 
day the cold pressures were at 28 psi.

I suspect either the hotter track surface or the final lowered pressure is 
a factor in the tire feathering.  BTW, Thunderhill is predominately right 
hand turns, so it made sense that the right tires would have problems.

Any help out there?

TIA,
Bob
