        I live in SoCal, so I don't need my heater often, but you know how
it is, I want the option. I have a 85 911 with auto heat, no levers at all.
The fan did not blow at first. But I could hear the motor pulling on the
cables. Well the fuses were blown so I replaced them and the fan started to
blow, but still no heat. Then I opened the lid while I had the heater
turned all the way up, and it made the most awful noise as if it was
rubbing against the fan housing. Where do I start in fixing this problem?
where is this fan at? how can I tell if my cables are busted? Can I fix
this easily? Heat exchangers look fine from the outside. Auto heat sounds
great, wish I had it ! Thanks Pfans for help.MLB.
