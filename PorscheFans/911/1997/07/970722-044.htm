10 or 15 years ago this was much more prevelant(UUCP), however this is
definitely *not* the most common method of mail delivery today(SMTP.)
Barring firewalls, or large companies that redirect mail internally, there
is generally only one other machine(besides the originating machine) your
mail may be stored on if the mail is unable to be delivered and that is
the secondary mail-exchanger listed for your domain. It goes like
this(again barring firewalls, secure sites, or really primitive setups):

1) You send a message to someone@example.com:

	a) A query is sent to the DNS server for example.com to find
	   out who is the primary mail exchanger for that domain.
	   An attempt to contact and send the mail directly to the
	   primary mail exchanger is made. If sucessful the primary
           exchanger processes for local delivery(or forwards it, or
           whatever.)If this fails then we move to:

	b) A query is sent to the DNS server for example.com to find
	   out who(if at all) the secondary mail exchanger for that
	   domain. An attempt to contact the secondary mail server
	   and send the mail to it is made. If this is sucessful,
	   the secondary server holds the mail in the queue, processing
	   the queue at regular intervals, attempting to send the mail
	   to the primary exchanger. If this fails, depending on the
	   configuration of your system, you will generally get a
	   "mail is undeliverable" message, and a "will try to resend,"
	   and the mail is queued on *your* box for however long is
           specified in the config files.

There shouldn't be any "re-forwarding." Once a message is delivered to
primary or secondary MX, it is deleted from the local queue(or at least it
*should* be.) The possiblity for looping does exist when the primary
thinks the secondary is the final destination, and the secondary thinks
the primary is. It gets real ugly real fast...

This is incorrect. Unless there is a failure to deliver to both primary
and secondary MX, there won't be any mail for the system upstream to send
again. The upstream doesn't care if it got Primary or Secondary MX, as
long as it got one of them...

Sorry for the non-Porsche related post, but this mis-information really
bugged me...
