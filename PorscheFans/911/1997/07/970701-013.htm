A week or so ago I was at a Drivers Ed event.  I had a little bit of fade
in my brakes, but nothing severe.

After the event I bled the brakes and did a cursory inspection of the
pads (ie didn't take them out, but checked that they had some pad left).
The pads have about 30-40% left on them.

Anyway to the point.  Since bleeding the brakes I have noticed that at
speeds above 45 when I brake reasonably hard I seem to get some brake
chatter.  Below 45 when I brake no noise at all and brakes seem to work
fine.

Anyone got any ideas as to what this could be.  When I get the chance
I will probably do another inspection, but if I am going to take the
wheels off if tbe problem might be in the pads I would be grateful
to know that.  Hence, I could replace the pads while already working
on the car (I'll just have to order the parts).

On a second note.  I have the intention to do more track events, but
do most of my driving on the street.  At events in the past I have
experienced the pedal starting to soften up on the last run of the day.
Do people think it would make sense for me to go to some kind of
racing pad ?  Generally, I don't want to have to change pads before and
after every event and I have heard that some racing pads may not be good
for street use.  Is this true for all racing pads ?
