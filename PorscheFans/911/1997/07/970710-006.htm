I removed it on both my 993's no problems with my dealer. They know 
Bruce Anderson's suggestion to remove it and they don't mind.

993 Cabrios work very well on the track. I switched my cab for a coupe 
because I didn't want to waste the car by installing a roll bar. Not 
all track events insist on roll bars but PCA events sure do. If you 
don't mind drilling all those holes, go for it. The cab is pretty 
stiff right out of the box and other than being a tad heavier it will 
run with the pack with no trouble.

Driver's Ed. I also agree that restricting performance is a bad idea. 
In Rennsport we stress smoothness and safety. Our events are usually 
incident free. We do not encourage students to drive anywhere near 
the limits of the car. If they have that tendency, my favorite trick 
is to make them drive as fast as they want to go -without-using-the-
brakes.  Not only does it slow them down, they end up cornering 
faster because without braking they are a helluva lot smoother.
