There is absoultely no need to use leaded fuel in a 1973 911. Use any
high quality high octane fuel.  The valve seals are more than hard
enough to last a long, long time using unleaded fuel. Anyone who tells
you otherwise is misinformed. The fact is lead emissions are highly
toxic and your car's motor just does not require lead for proper
operation. If you don't beleive me, read Bruce Anderson's "911
Performance Handbook".

This is a subjective issue. I would leave the small blemishes intact.
Porsches were built to be driven. If you drive the car then the paint
can not be maintained in perfect condition. A professional could use
touch up and/or color sand the blemishes. But what's the point? Your
paint sounds much better than average and originality is a key factor in
the market value of your car. Just use the correct touch up paint and
procedure for repairing stone chips.

There are two different views on this topic.

 How often (and where) will you drive > 100 mph? Unless you become a
drivers ed event freak(this can be a wonderful way to enjoy your Porsche
and learn how to really drive it, but I'm told it is highly addictive)
it will cost you twice to modify the car. Once to do the modification
tastefully, and then again as resale value will likey decrease since
originality usually increases market value. The clear bra does not (in
my opinion) increase the desireability of your car. If I were to buy
your car, I would rather touch up the stone chips then have a clear bra
on the car. I'm sure others will have the opposite opinion.

On the otherhand, there is no shortage of original 1973 911s. Early 911s
car are special - but they are not that special. If you will get
pleasure out of modifying the car then just do it. I think modificatons
for safety purposes are desireable. I've replaced my stock seats with
modern Recarros and before that I installed modern retractible seat
belts. I've kept all the mechanicals original (a previous owner replaced
the troublesome hydropnuematic front struts with 911S hardware). I even
decided not to change the original (and excellent) 14" Fuchs with 15"
Fuchs from the same era. I enjoy preserving the 1970-71 technology and
the feel it gives the car. I do not drive > 100 mph for more than a few
seconds, so I do not feel compelled to add front and rear spoilers.

My advice would be to make sure the car is 100% mechanically and then
drive it as much as you can just the way it is for a year. Then you can
decide what alterations may be desireable.

Best wishes for many mile of enjoyment with your new early 911. 1973 is
a wonderful year. You are fortunate to own that car.
