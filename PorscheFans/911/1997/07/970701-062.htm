Rick,

What would happen to your license or insurance rates if you were "nailed"?

The Valentine One has consistently garnered top ratings -BY FAR- in the
C&D radar detector tests every time it has been tested.  I have driven for 
several years with it, and the range and signaling capability has always 
amazed me; between it and the CB radio, I have not had a problem since 
getting it.  Only problem is poor discrimination between true radar and
burglar alarms, but I can live with this.

Subject:

Does anybody have an recommendations on any other detectors?  I may buy a
new one.  It would have to have laser, because these Western New York cops
use it sometimes, and also have VG-2 detection because I drive in Canada at
least once a week.

I've seen several brands that fit this description for around $ 100.  I can
respect the Valentine One, but it seems a bit pricey.  Maybe it's worth
it...
