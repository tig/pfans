Porsche 911 timing chains are double-row heavy-duty roller chain.  There is
almost no danger of the chain breaking.  The pins joining the chain links
can wear slightly.  Since there are many links in the chain, the sum of all
the worn pins can cause a small error in valve timing.  I would not even
consider changing a timing chain, unless the engine was apart for some
other repair.  Then by all means invest in a new chain.

I have seen several engine disasters caused by the "tensioner failure"
problem.  In every case, the end of a chain guide has broken off, and gone
through a sproket.  This breaks the tensioner mechanism, and caused the
engine to "jump time".  Valves and pistons collide, causing thousands of $
in damage.

Early tensioners were spring loaded, with a hydraulic damper.  A failed
tensioner has lost the hydraulic damping action, and the chain can get
slack and whip around during sudden changes in engine speed (usually gear
shifts).  You will hear chain rattle, and should replace the tensioner and
all guides right away.  Chain whip is what breaks the guides, and starts
the dreaded jump time accident.  As long as you fix it before the system
jumps time, there is no need to replace the timing chain.  You can retime
the valves if the engine has high miles, and the chains are worn.

By the late 1970s, Porsche improved on the early design with the "930
tensioner".  I was basically the same design, but with a more robust and
durable hydraulic damper.  The original chain rails were rubber, which gets
brittle when it ages.  Later rails were aluminum, with rubber bonded to it
for the chain to rub against.  Both types can break and mess up an engine. 
The latest rails are ABS plastic, which is almost unbreakable, and very
durable as well.  I strongly recommend you remove any rubber or aluminum
chain guides, and install the ABS type.

Everybody is now pushing the "pressure-fed" system, where the tensioner is
supplied from the oil pump.  The system is complicated and expensive to
retro-fit to an older 911.  I do not recommend it unless you have money to
spare and plan to race.  For an older car, the best insurance is new chain
rails, and the 930 tensioner.  As long as you have the ABS guides, and
replace the tensioner when you hear chain noise, the original system is
bullet proof.

I have had my 1970 911T since 1977, and have some track time and a lot of
high-speed (100 MPH+) miles on the car.  I have done two engine rebuilds,
and replaced the guides, and chains, and the tensioners each time.  I used
930 tensioners on my last rebuild six years ago.  I have no concern that
the engine will fail because of the tensioners.  The pressure fed system
may last forever, but for the cost, I would just replace the chain, the
tensioners, and the guides every time the engine is overhauled.  The cost
is only a few percent of the total parts cost, and it is the last time you
need to worry about the timing chain.  The tensioner, chains, and guides
that I replaced had over 100,000 miles, and still worked and looked fine. 
Replaced them as cheap insurance on all the expensive new parts in the
engine.

Hope this helps.
