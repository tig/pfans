You might want to consider the fact that we aren't spamming the news
server.  You might want to realize that, in fact, the mail server itself is
responsible for the inundation you are experiencing.  You might consider
that we actually "replied to all" as instructed upon subscription to the
mailing list.  You might want to theorize how difficult it might be for us
to sit at our computers and continually bombard the mail server.  You might
then realize not only how difficult it would be, but also how very near
impossible such a feat would be.  You then might want to sit down and have
a long look at yourself in a mirror.  I don't know why you might want to do
this, but you might.  You might also want to eat.  Or perhaps you might
want to go for a walk.  You might feel kind of silly.  Don't.  You might be
a nice guy.  You also might not deserve to feel like a weenie for being
rude to us.  It happens.  Or it might happen, I don't know.

I might be Frank.
My wife might be Lou.

We might thank you for your time . . .
