When you do a corner balance it is almost impossible to avoid messing 
up the alignment. You are changing the ride height and unless the 
change is miniscule, your alignment is blown. Balance first then 
align. Do the balance with you in the driver's seat and a half tank 
of gas or whatever you normally have on the track.  Normally you use 
the alignment rack to do the corner balance anyway so why not finish 
the job correctly? :-)

Interesting question about tires from Brad (I think, the GPR spam has 
affected my memory).  If you drive the car in winter you have two 
choices, high performance winter tires or, drive very slowly. High 
performance street tires are compounded to operate with max traction 
and and resist high temperatures such as you'd get on a high speed 
cruise in the summer. THEY SUCK AT LOW TEMPS!  Compounds which handle 
high temps are a compromise. They are at their worst traction-wise at 
temps below 45 degress F.  At very low temps, i.e below freezing, the 
rubber freezes and there is very little traction at all.  Four season 
tires and winter tires are compounded to remain flexible and grippy 
at low temps with the compromise being high temp resistance and 
durability when run very hot.

I live in Montreal and know exactly what you're facing. When the sun 
is out and the roads are dry I drive my 911 ... slowly or, I fit a 
set of high perf. winter tires (I like the toyos winter jobbies 
which are supposedly designed for the 993 and turbo). 

As to a tire which will give you warning ... dunno. Porsches usually 
have broad tires on properly sized rims and relatively stiff 
suspension. 

They don't squeal much under any circumstances unless you lock them 
up or get sideways.  I don't know which model 911 you drive. Pre 89 
models don't give as much warning as the later ones. No 911 warns you 
as politely as a rear drive front engine car or a front driver for 
that matter. Some tires are more forgiving than others. Goodrich R1's 
are not as for giving as a street tire.  Based on tests I've seen the 
Toyo T1 was well rated for driver feedback but again, I wouldn't use 
tire squeal as my warning sign. The car will talk to you if you tune 
in to it. 

I am personally very fond of the Bridgestone S02 and the new Yokohama 
AVS-S1Z tires for my 911.
