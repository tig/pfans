John, are you SURE these are 4.5x15 wheels on a '68 911S?

The way I understood it, 4.5" wheels were only on the the original '67S
(the first year for both the S model and the Fuchs alloys).  My '68 912 has
5.5"x15" fuchs on it.  The increased wheel width was one of the minor
changes made '67 to '68 model years...

Can anybody else clarify this?  Why would a set of 4.5" be found on a '68S?
Early car?  Rare spec that this owner has?  Now I'm curious...so if anyone
has an answer -- please let me know.

Cheers
Thom Kuby

PS -- hope you find it!  these early wheels aren't easy to come by.  My
"set" of 5 actually came from three different directions.  But the wheel
dates, stamped on inside, are all real close together...spooky eh?
