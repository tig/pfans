Fellow P-fans;

When my 1980 911SC was up on the lift recently, the mechanic noted "Your throttle bushings
are all shot. Your probably not getting full throttle."  Of course, I want as much throttle as I can
get!

But, something doesn't seem right with his statement.  It is my understanding that the
accelerator rod (which is surround by three bushings) is under a tension load, not a
compression load, when the accelerator is pressed.  Therefore the rod wouldn't be subject to
bending and providing less than full travel when the pedal is pressed.

Is my assumption correct, and/or could he have been talking about the bushings in the lever
mechanisms?  Are these bushings susceptible enough to wear that they would noticeably
affect throttle position?

Thanks in advance.
Jeff
