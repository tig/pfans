Reading the recent mail on alignment on 911's I thought I would check 
the front camber on mine as it seems to eat the inside 1/3 of the 
front tires. I have not measured it exactly yet (hope to do it at the 
weekend) but just by using a spirit level on the alloy rims it is 
obvious that I have more than the 0 + 50' of camber spec'ed in my 
manual for a 88 coupe.

I have read up a lot about  camber and toe in adjustments and these 
all seem straight forward for a DIY attempt, but if my camber is out, 
why is it out? Could the caster also be out??. The car has a very 
complete history and has only been main dealer serviced. It has never 
been in an accident (but then everyone says that!).

Having only driven this 911 I have no idea how heavy the stearing 
should be. It seems fairly heavy on mine (2 hands are a must for 
tightish 90 bends). Does the caster have any effect on stearing 
weight?  Can a DIY'er check the caster and if so how?

I appreciate any comments on this.
