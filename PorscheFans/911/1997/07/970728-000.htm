A company called Protomotive Engineering in Southern California
specializes in just the kind of thing you're looking to do to your '85
Carrera.  Check out their website at:
http://www.net-quest.com/~knighton/.  And when they're through with your
engine, you'll have a lot more than just an 85 HP increase over your
stock motor.  I think it's closer to 110 HP or so.   Their "Stage 1"
motor upgrade on a 3.2 engine results in a total HP rating of 360,
according to their web page. While you're at their site, drool over the
600 and 700+ HP engine conversions they do.  Wow.   

Another approach to what you want to do would be to swap your engine for
a 3.3 liter
Turbo engine.  Then take it to Power Haus in Arizona (somewhere) and let
them stroke the engine for a few weeks.  To do all this would, of
course, take a lot of $$$$$$$$
to accomplish.  

Good luck in your project.
