Randy,

Changing ride height is the same as installing new t-bars i.e. it's labor
intensive but if you're a decent wrench, can be done in a weekend.  The fronts
are real easy - 30 min job.  Just 2 adjuster nuts.

You need to re-index the splines on the t-bars to lower the car in the rear.
There is a small amount available (~1/2") w/o re-indexing since you have the
2-piece adjustable spring plates.   This may be all you need.
Due to the labor involved, I'd recommend going to bigger bars at the same time.

The usual lowering is to Euro height i.e. 25.5" F and 25" rear ground 
to fender.

I've lowered my car ~1" below Euro height and I just have to be careful 
with low
driveways.   It's not a daily-driver, just a weekend toy so factor in 
your intended use
when you lower it.   You also need to install rack spacers in front to 
correct bump steer.

See my Torsion Bar FAQ at the Central PA PCA Region website:
http://home.ptd.net/~psprechr/ under Tech Info on how-to-do-it.
