This isn't the first time I've heard this but if you're willing to move
the mirror, the passenger side can work very well.  Just mount the mirror
about 2" forward/aft (can't remember which direction on a T) of the
original
mounting holes and it will be perfectly visible through the quarterlight.
If you look really close, you can tell that they're assymetrical but it's
hard to spot.
