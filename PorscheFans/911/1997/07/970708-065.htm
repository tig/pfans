     All,
     I recently switched my 1980 911SC to Mobil 1 and I had the same bad 
     experience that I had with my 1966 GT-350, namely excessive leaks, and 
     it started burning oil like crazy.  (Everytime I rev the 911's motor, 
     a huge puff of blue smoke comes out).  Anyways, I chalked the oil 
     problem in the Shelby (~3500 miles on the engine) up to the fact that 
     I have forged pistons and the oil control isn't as good as with cast 
     pistons.  I switched back to conventional oil and the fouling problem 
     went away.
.. . .

Alex,

I'm not convinced that the oil is the problem.  You may want to check if
you overfilled the oil tank causing oil to enter the airbox.  Pull the
plugs, inspect and replace with a fresh set if necessary.

Other things to consider.  Did you knock off a vacuum line during the oil
change?  Did you get a bad tank of gas?  How old is you O2 sensor
(disconnect it or replace it)?

From your description, I might agree that additional leaks showed up from
the synthetic and perhaps some burning.  I'm not certain that the poor
running resulted from the oil.
