To see what was lost in this unfortunate 96 Turbo accident at Laguna,
take a look at:

http://www.bushwacker.net/ggr/members/index.html#R
Rattazzi, Gianluca

It took this picture at the GGR Event at Laguna before he did the BMW
event.

I agree with Charles, we should learn how to drive our cars without
detuning them.  I recently spun my '92 Turbo a couple of times at Laguna
and it was because of my inexperience and the fact that I took the car
over it's limits.  I freely admit that I have limited experience with
the car (3 Time Trials, 8 or so Autox) and am favor of

1) more closely matching the instructors with the students
2) having the instructors really push for slow, incremental changes
during the course of an event, rather than trying multiple things at a
time and "experimenting" with the tried and true line

While excellent drivers give great instruction most of the time, certain
cars are meant to be driven differently and respond to input on vastly
different scales from those that many of the instructors drive.

skills,

The driver of the 911 Turbo was an experienced BMW school driver in the
advanced group.  He had an E36 M3 left at home with warped rotors that
was used in many prior schools, without incident.  The driver was having

some difficulty adapting to the 911 Turbo and the incredible performance
on
tap.  The accident was truly unfortunate.  And a reminder that Laguna
Seca
can build your confidence and then deliver a very unpleasant surprise
with
its concrete walls.

The idea of limiting performance at Drivers' Schools with chips, speed
limits or banning R1's is an incredibly bad idea.  The performance of
the cars, BMW and others, continues to climb with the development of
technology.  The Schools need to continue to adapt to this performance
increase as they have done in the past.

Safety Yes, performance limiters No.  If cars get bent at a school it is

regrettable but acceptable when proper safety equipment prevents injury.
