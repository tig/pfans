	Brian, this is one of those "...wouldn't it be nice if this
	stuff really worked..." products. Kinda like "high-performance"
	ignition wires, transmission leak sealer fluid, fix a flat, etc.,
	i.e., this product isn't going to do anything for you.
	
	Will it hurt the car? Maybe. No one really knows yet. However,
	it is pretty unwise to put anything in your oil *other* than
	more oil. I figure if it was really all that awesome, Porsche
	would recommend its use. Good luck.
