Air-coolers,

Thanks one and all for the reality check re the 1975 911S.  Sounds like you
really enjoy your cars.  Also sounds like it's a steep and expensive
learning curve to switch models. I know 944s fairly well, what can be done
to them, and what isn't worth doing. 911s would be a mystery for a while. 
Think the car I looked at had most the upgrades mentioned, but the rust is
the big problem. Can't afford to spend money on body work and
suspension/engine mods at the same time.

The bottom line I synthesized was go beyond '75 for a 911 unless you really
knew the history, and best to start w/ an SC.  I feel a need for major
speed at this point, and getting more out of a 2.7 l engine is going to
cost.  And getting larger rear wheels on the '75 is also going to cost.
Would be a long, expensive road getting this car ready for the track. 

And by the way, 944s will also exhibit the dreaded trailing throttle
oversteer with the right (or wrong) suspension setup and enough speed in
the corners.  Don't think the track techniques for the two models are that
different. Brake hard, set up the suspension, and stand on it. The 944s may
be more forgiving, but I do wish mine would power out of an exit like a
rear end heavy 911. 944s feel like they're clawing their way out.
