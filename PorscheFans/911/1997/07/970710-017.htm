I sent this out right before the list went down and only got one reply 
(thanks for the picture David!) and was wondering if anyone out there could 
explain the easiest way to remove then oil cooler from a CIS 2.7.


I have had this oil leak on my right heat exchanger ever since I installed 
an auxiliary front mounted oil cooler on my '73 911T (with a 77 911S 2.7 in 
it).  So I pulled the right heat exchanger off yesterday and it appears 
like it is coming from where the oil cooler mates up to the case.  I see 
there are seals that probably need replacing but I can't figure out how to 
remove the cooler.  I can not get to the top 2 nuts.  The car has CIS in it 
and I can't see a thing from the top and from underneath I can't get at 
them either.  Has anyone done this before?  Do I have to pull the engine or 
remove my CIS to remove the oil cooler?  (Haven't done that before and 
don't want to) Any suggestions or help would be much appreciated!  I was 
also wondering about a metal tube that you can see from underneath the car. 
 This tube is about 3/4 of an inch in diameter and has some oil coming out 
of it.  It appears to be a oil drain/overflow tube or some thing like that. 
 It is bolted to the side of the oil cooler.  Any one know what it is and 
what it connects to?

Thanks!

Scott
