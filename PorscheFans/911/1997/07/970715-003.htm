Pfans,

I asked this question a couple of years ago, but have
never been able to solve the problem.  My engine cuts-
out on occasion - one occasion - only when I turn left.
The severity of the cutting out is a function of how hard
I turn left.  If I am waiting at a stoplight to turn left and
then turn, the cut-out is pretty severe.  If I merely change
lanes on the interstate it is more of a very noticable
"miss".

Here's the weird part: I have, over the past couple of
years, painstakingly deduced under what conditions
this occurs (e.g. gas tank level, engine temp, etc., etc.).
Believe it or not, the *only* parameter that seems to
affect when this happens is ambient temperature!  It
almost never does it when the outside temperature
is below 70 F, and does it almost constantly when it's
greater than 95 F (like last Sunday).  It is also of mild
interest that this *never* happens on the track - only
street driving.  It also only occurs as I am *just* begin-
ning to turn left (i.e. if I continue to turn left, like on a
cloverleaf, once the engine stops its stumbling, it
runs fine through the rest of the turn).

I have been unable to re-create this anomaly in my
garage (can't turn left).  I have always assumed that
it is some ignition problem, but I can't find a problem.
(I also can't rationalize an ignition problem that would
manifest itself only under the above conditions).

The engine's a stock 2.7, with new plugs, wires, cap,
rotor, points.  Fuel distributor is less than 5 years old,
as is the warm-up regulator & aux air valve for that
matter.  Runs perfect most of the time.

What do you think?  CD box?  Coil?  The only way to 
fix this, IMO, is to start replacing stuff until the problem
goes away.  

Another interesting point is that a friend of mine with
an '85 Carrera has the *exact* same problem (only
his cut-out only shows up when accelerating from a
dead stop).  The 3.2 and the 2.7 share virtually nothing
from an injection/ignition standpoint, so I didn't glean
much from that unless the problem is in the fuse box
or something weird like that.

I'm willing to entertain any ideas on what this might be...

TIA,

Mike Dayton
