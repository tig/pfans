>>My 82 911SC has had overheating problems<<

Jeff,

My 83SC showed the same types of temperatures you are seeing (except no
track comparisons). I ended up giving my mechanic a substantial sum of $$=

to trouble shoot it. He also calibrated the temp with a probe in the oil
tank, and it agreed with the gauge. The end result was he replaced the
engine thermostat and put on a late model oil screen cover, I don't know
what else to call it, the thing on the engine case with the drain plug.
This eliminated the drain plug, making oil changes a bit messier but
improving oil pickup somewhat. Temps dropped down to a range of 210 or mo=
re
depending on how hot it is. This is a gain of around 30 degrees. He says =
he
consulted with several of the shops in the area, all of whom said he had
done everything they could think of to check it out. Their consensus is i=
t
still runs hot, but they ran out of ideas. =


You might also check that the 'oil screen cover' is on the correct way.
