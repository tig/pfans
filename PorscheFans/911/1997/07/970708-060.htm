In the process of helping a friend remove an overly large sound system
that was in his newly purchased 1990 C2, I need to know what wire, or pin,
on the DIN cable that runs from the radio to the stock amplifier under the
passengers seat does what.  There are 6 wires in the cable, 4 of them are
the same size and two are quite a lot smaller.  There is also a braided
shield. I know that one of the small ones is a 12v signal to turn on the
amp, and I suspect that the four larger wires are the four signals, but I
don't know what the other small (blue) wire is, nor do I know which signal
wire is which.  Does anyone have any information to shed  light on this,
I have looked at the factory wiring diagrams, but they do not help.  Thank
you in advance for any help.

Regards
Tom Smith
