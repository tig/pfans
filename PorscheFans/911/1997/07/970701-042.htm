Hello air-cooled folks.  I belong to the 924-944 list (yeah, I know), but
would like some advice/opinions on purchasing a 1975 911S Targa.  I know
just enough about 911s to be dangerous.  This topic is probably old hat on
this server, but would appreciate comments.

I love my 944 S2, but 911s do have a certain charisma and this '75 seems to
be in pretty good shape. 

-- 130K miles, rebuild engine w/ 20K miles, upgraded head bolts and timing
chain to offset some of the bad features of the 2.7 liter engine. 
-- Rebuilt clutch that feels good even to a 944 driver. No razor-sharp
release point common to many older 911s.  --Rust spots beneath headlights
and on one lower rear corner of the door jam (a hole all the way thru). 
-- Compared to my 944, the car felt high and relatively unstable at 80-90
mph, but I'm not sure what they're supposed to feel like.  
-- Felt good downshifting and accelerating thru sweepers, but ground the
gears a bit from 5 to 4 and 4 to 3 if shifting was too quick, or w/out
double-clutching. Brake and throttle pedals are at very different levels -
heel/toe would be difficult w/out a major addition to height of throttle
pedal.
-- Targa was wind noise, but would assume that needs to be rebuild.
-- I trust the Porsche shop that's selling it, and who's looked after it
several years.

The car would be for fun driving and for the track -- maybe Vintage racing.
 Does the Targa body flex that much more than a coupe? What's the cost like
for lowering the body a bit and upgrading the suspension? Is it inevitable
that I will want to drop a larger engine in it (felt pretty quick for only
175 hp)?  Is the oversteer pretty extreme on these older models w/out the
larger rear wheels?  I expect it would take me a while to get comfortable
in the corners, but then that's part of the charm.  I like having my 944
take care of me when I do something stupid, but think it would be
interesting to track something that bites back a little more.

TIA. Please reply to me (zmf@uwyo.edu) since I don't get the 911 posts. And
please don't mention to the 924-944 list that I dropped by.

-- Nick Fuzessery
