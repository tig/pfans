Nill, I believe if it isn't shown on the sticker, you don't have it.  Easy
test I
believe is to jack up rear of car, put it in neutral, then try rotating the
jacked-up
wheel.  If it moves, you don't have limited slip.

Are you the origiinal owner of the car?  If not, previous owner might have 
put in a "performance" chip, which commonly increases the rev limiter.  I
would find it a little hard to believe the factory unit is bad, since it is
controlled
electronically by the fuel injection "brain".

If my '87 Carrera's hood sticker does not show an option code for limited
slip, does that mean it does not have it?  How does one tell if a car has
limited slip?

My car seems to rev freely well past the redline, to almost 7000 (which is
as far as I've tried it).  Shouldn't the rev limiter cut in before that?
What's more likely, that my tach is off or the rev limiter isn't working?
