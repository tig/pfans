I have changed the front bearings on my 70 911T.  I don't think the design
has changed.  I am also less likely to change bearings not.  They last a
long time, and will do fine if they are smooth and don't make noise.  My
very heavy 300 D Mercedes still has its original bearings after over
200,000 miles.  Repacked them once.

The trickey part is removing the race from the hub.  The safest way is to
use a brass drift and a hammer.  Brass will not scratch the hardened steel
parts.  I shrink the new races in:  after everything is cleaned up, put the
hub in an oven at about 150 degrees F.  Put the races in the freezer for 20
minutes or so.  They will drop right into the hot hub, and lock in when
thermal equilibrium is reached.  You should still set them hard on the
shoulder with a brass drift punch (the shrinkage will cause some clearance
between the race and the shoulder.  This is not a tough job.

Before I can run the next autocross, I need to do a couple of minor things.
The main thing is my front wheel bearing.  Being a glutton for punishment,
I thought I might do it myself.  Major questions are how do you get the
bloody thing off?  And what's the best way to set the preload when putting
the new one on?  Any other pitfalls for a 911 newbie?

On my old RX-7, I just used a hammer and screwdriver to get the old
bearings off, and a piece of pipe and a bigger hammer to put the new ones
on with no ill effects.  Something about this procedure bothers me on the
911. :)

TIA
