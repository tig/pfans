Our group, Rennsport Region, part of zone 1 is having a lively debate 
about making the stock Boxter elegible for DEW.  Apparently Zone 4 
allows them as does NER.

At the moment Zone 1 does not allow them without an aftermarket 
roll bar. 

Given the success of the Boxter there is a lot of pressure from 
owners to attend DEW and few opf them are prepared to install an 
additional roll bar. I can't blame them, the aftermarket bars are 
really ugly and the car is ill designed to have one fitted. Besides, 
Porsche built the car with roll bars at the factory!

The concerns expressed are two:

1) Is the factory roll bar system strong enough to withstand a high 
speed roll-over?  

2) The factory bars are relatively low. What happend to a helmeted 
driver of 6 foot or more whose helmet is higher than the factory bar?

I recognize that PCA tends to err on the conservative side. I also 
suspect that PCA does not take the factory's advice on such matters 
too seriously, witness the requirement for the 993 Targa to have a 
bar initially an then allowed without one.

Having attended the Exec. meeting of the Rennsport Region, I promised 
to use the power of the list to seek an answer.

Thos in favor of allowing stock Boxters say:

    Meets German roll over standards which are much more rigorous 
than DOT. 

    Boxters drive on the Autobahn at high speeds and must resist a 
high speed roll-over.

    NER has investigated and are satisfied.
    
Those against say:

    We don't know that the boxter is safe in a high speed roll over. 
The 993 Cab is not.

    We are concerned because taller people end up with their helmet 
above the roll bar, this assumed to have nasty consequences if the 
car rolls.

Guys, Bruce, Pete A, does anyone have some (hopefully) factory 
supported facts to inject into this lively argument which seems 
largely based on hearsay?

I hope this will be resolved in favor of the Boxter because to 
maintain our growth, PCA needs those guys out on the track.
