Colin O'Keefe asks for input on tires:

Colin,

Given your objectives, I think you should consider a set of truly
sticky tires, such as the BFG Comp T/A R1s.  They won't go
more than a few thousand miles on the street, but they're rated
for speed, relatively cheap, and will meet your number one 
objective better than anything on your list.  After a set of those,
(and that might be a while if you don't drive the car that much), 
you can decide if the economics lean towards stick or prudence.

You can do the backs first if you like, but you'll have more fun
if you get the whole set at one time.  What will happen if you do
only the backs is that the car will exhibit less oversteer and more 
plow.  If you're ready for that, you'll be OK.
