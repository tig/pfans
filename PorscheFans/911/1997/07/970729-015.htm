Dear Pfans:

        I bought a 1987 Targa about 2.5 months ago and live in the Fort
Myers area of Florida. I have been unable to find someone who will work on
my car reasonably or with a modicum of honesty and competence. I had been
driving a 93 Acura Legend which was admittedly boring but great from a
maintenance point of view. When I lived in Vermont I had a great
relationship with my mechanics who were friends and patients as well. When
they said you need this to be done and this is what it is going to cost I
felt a high level of comfort. I have owned 911's before and I know they need
a little extra finesse but down here the guys who specialize on 
Porsche's seem to think they're brain surgeons. I have had outrageous
estimates and poor work done on a number of occasions.

        I am frustrated to the point that I am considering giving up my
911. I would still like to drive a car that is fun so this is my question:
Are there any of you out there who have owned 911's and 944's. Is it a huge
let down to go to say a 944s2 cabriolet. What is it like to drive and is it
a simpler car to maintain or are we still in the same boat - ie. it's a
Porsche and therefore you need a specialist to work on it. Any feedback here
would be greatly appreciated.
