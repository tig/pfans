Mike, me thinks something is up here! You need two A's and two B's. Each
tire has a directional arrow on it. The rear tires should have the
directional arrows pointing in the direction of rotation. The front tires
should have the directional arrow pointing COUNTER rotation. According to
Yoko this has something to do with the carcass design and braking forces
blah blah blah. Anyway, you need two A's and two B's in order to accomplish
this "pattern". The problem probably is that supply of A008RS tires is
drying up as the same size is becoming available for Yoko's new R compound
tire, the A032R. As a tire size becomes available in A032R, Yoko is
discontinuing the A008RS in that size. That may be the problem here.
