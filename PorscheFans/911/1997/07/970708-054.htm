I am looking the front clear european signal lens and maybe light
assembly for my 96 993 C2, would it take out the little black rubber
bumper?  I have seem some pictures of the european version 96 993 C2
without the black little bumper, and it looks good.  How do I remove the
rear black bumpers?  Would it leave a hole after I remove it?

Where can I purchase these clear lens, I have looked at every Porsche
magazine, and there were no mention of the newer 96 model lens, only for
the older Porsches.  What kind of price woul dI be expected to pay for
them?  

By the way I have installed the K&N air filter on my 96 993 and I works
really good.

I am getting about 19 to 20 miles to a gallon on city daily driving.  It
burns about 1/2 quart of oil every 1000 miles.

The factory specs. on the 96 993 says it can reach 0-60 mph in 5.4 sec. 
is that a conservative number?

What is the "Nuckle" sound coming from the back seat area of my Porsche
when ever I pass a bump on the road?  I have heard it before in other
older 911s, is it a typical Porsche characterist?

I have been driving the car in the Georgia Summer heat = (90 degree with
80 % humidity)  with the air conditioner on, in town driving the oil
temp gaug seems to get a little higher but still below the niddle point,
and during highway speeds the temp. drops below the first marker point. 
I think the engineers at Porsche had finally for it just about right
now!  Good job guys!!!  

Thanks
