Pholks,

I recently received a set of HRE wheels that I ordered from
Automotion.  When I ordered the wheels, I was somewhat
apprehensive about whether or not the things would fit as
I was going to put relatively large tires on them (245/45s
on 8x16s in the front).

To ease my fears, I "test fit" a similar sized set of wheels
on my car to make sure they would fit and then measured
the backspacing of the wheels that fit.  When I ordered the
wheels from Automotion, I told them what backspacing
measurements I was looking for.  The salesman said,
"Oh, don't worry about it, HRE makes these things all
the time to fit your car".  He did take my measurements,
though and said he would forward them to HRE and have
them call me if there was any discrepancy.

To make a long story short, the front wheels don't fit.  And
guess why?  Yep, the backspacing is wrong.  If they'd
made them like I asked they would've fit.  The inside lip
of the wheels rubs the "dust cap" on the strut.  They made
the wheels with 3/16" more backspacing than I asked
for.

I was just going to order a .25" spacer, but this pisses
me off.  I paid alot of money for these wheels and they
don't fit.  One of the rear wheels won't hold air either, but
that's another problem altogether.

At least I got my headers on.  :>|
