A friend of mine would like to buy a Boxter, and he has located one at a
dealer in Washington DC. The car belongs to a lady who doesn't want it, so
she is willing to sell it. Thus far, no problem.

The question is, is there some sort of inter-dealer exchange or delivery
system in place so that if my friend is going to buy the car the dealer can
deliver it through a dealer in San Diego, where he lives? If such a plan
exists, how does it work?

He will be in Washington next week, so he could take delivery there, but I
don't think that driving a brand new car across the country is a very wise
idea. What do you guys think? Does anybody have any experience with
shipping the car with a company that specializes in that sort of thing?

Perhaps a better question altogether would be: does anybody have, or know
somebody that has a Boxter for sale in southern California?

Thanks,


Gabriel
