I run Cool Carbon blue pads. They work fine on the street as well as on
the track. However, they produce a fair amount of dust and they squeak
some. These are the trade-offs you have to live with for a street/track
pad.

You should also use a high boiling point fluid. I use Motul but there
are other good ones out there.

Another thing you can do is brake less on the track. I know that sounds
funny, but not only is it the fastest way around the track, it gives the
brakes more time to cool. When I say brake less, I mean for less time.
You of course have to increase the pedal pressure to give the same
amount of slow-down in this shorter period of time. Our PCA region
(PNWR) holds driving skills sessions with, amongst other things, a
threshold braking section. This really helped me to learn how much I
could apply the brakes before the car would skid.
