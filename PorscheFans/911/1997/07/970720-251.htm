We just wanted to show you how polite some of your fellow members are -- I
am ecstatic that, as the mail server fouls up, I am graced with this sort
of extreme literacy.  Thanks for all of your support.  Oh, and Quark, I
find it interesting that your mother's name is Louann.  Isn't it
coincidental that that is my wife's name too (although I don't claim to
manipulate the same orifices that you do with your mother).  Please realize
that I am in no way upset that you have sex with your mother in her anus.  
Oh, and I didn't watch, either.  Good luck . . .
