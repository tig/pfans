Something similar happened to me on my '68 911T, which has the standard
distributor and points, since I don't know if the 85 has electronic
ignition, this might or might not apply. 
After driving in the rain for most of the day with several start and
stops no problem. We went out to eat that night, the rain had stopped
nice summer evening, anyway after the meal the car wouldn't start, I
pushed and pushed but nothing. Eventually phone the AA, the guy who came
out was impressed by the Porsche; asked the problem, tested for spark at
the plugs, removed the distributor cap sprayed it with Q20 a light
penetrating oil wiped it clean and said start her up. I did, he said the
heat of the engine, and all the moisture in the air had caused water to
condense inside the cap causing it to short. He also said that the light
layer of oil removed the water and should protect it for a good while, a
year later still no problem.
good luck
