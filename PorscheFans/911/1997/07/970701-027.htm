I have heard some minor noise with the Porterfields, but on a previous
911 I had a symptom that sounds similar to yours.  After installing new
front pads on a '79 SC, I would get this sort of grinding noise; only at
slow speeds and light brake pedal pressure and mostly on the right
front.  It turned out that while the rotor appeared smooth, it in fact
had a ridge at the outer most and inner most edges of where the pad
contacts it.  I pulled off the wheel and took a large file and slowly
worked the outer ridge off by rotating the rotor and holding the file
nearly flat against the surface.  Took a little effort but fixed the
problem.  I have since taken to chamfering the pads a bit when
installing them as well.  Haven't had that sort of problem crop up on
other 911s I've worked on after taking those precautions.

Good Luck,
