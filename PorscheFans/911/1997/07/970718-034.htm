1)	Premium unleaded works fine.  Stay away from oil and fuel additives. 
Believe it or not, the better brands are fine as is.  The changes make for
cars to run on no-lead fuel are better alloy for the valves, and Stellite-6
(cobalt alloy) valve seats.  Porsche 911s have had this from the start. 
Early 911 owners often ran "white gas", which is the name for Amoco premium
unleaded.  Before the unleaded gas requirement, Amoco was the only mass
marketer for premium unleaded fuel.

2)	As far as modifying the car, or getting it painted, that is a personal
preference.  Early 911s are collectable, but if you plan to drive the
thing, it will continue to get more ratty.  I would do cosmetic maintenance
to keep the car nice.  Enjoy.



Hello all,
     My wife and I have just bought a 1973 911T w/CIS. The car is spotless
inside and out. I have a few questions about it that I thought this very
knowledgeable list could answer. Since we are expecting to pick it up
tomorrow a prompt reply to my e-mail address or the list would be greatly
appreciated.

      1.) I understand that these cars ran leaded gasoline. A mechanic who
   did the pre-purchase says that he can get       regular leaded here in
   Denver. I thought they made the stuff illegal to buy at a regular gas
   station. The salesman            (what do they know...) says you can run
   high-test (91 octane +) in the engine with no problem. Since we are
   about to     pick up the car and it'll probably need gas, who is right?
   Can the early cars be run on unleaded? Will I need to run
   unleaded with a lead additive (yuck!)?
      2) The paint is the original code 114 (signal yellow) and is very
   nice and all original (verified). The lower rocker        panels have
   the "PORSCHE" script with stripes that is in pretty good shape but as
   24-year-old decals are prone to            do they have
   faded/cracked/yellowed a bit. There are a few rock chips and really
   minor dents on the bonnet and         nose and a small scratch on the
   passengers door. My question is this: Since the original paint is in
   such fine shape   should we fix these small blemishes or leave them as
   part of the cars "character". We aren't trying to build a
   100-point concours winner but small stuff like this on any car bothers
   me. Should I just let it go? If I did have the work       done it would
   be at a professional restoration/body shop whom I have gone through
   before and specializes in older       cars. I think that they would be
   able to fix these spots, match the paint and install new decals without
   harming the rest       of the originality.
      3)Should we keep the car as a) original as possible b) original in
   1973 options but not necessarily in what the cardex  says about this car
   (i.e. add front spoiler and rear valence) or c) add what we want
   (tastefully, of course). I guess the  question is should we keep this
   car original and true to its cardex records (which we will be getting
   from Porsche).         l'm leaning towards originality but that front
   end does get light at over 100...     :-)
      Clear bras - I have this on two other cars and they work great. For
   those who don't know what they are basically it is a      clear tape,
   cut to the car's dimensions and then applied wet to the
   nose/rockers/mirrors/wheel wells. It protects        against bugs/rocks
   and can be replaced without damage to the paint. Looks 100% better than
   a vinyl bra and won't       flap in the breeze. My question is since
   this was not something in existence in 1973 should we put it on this
   car. I            guess this is another "originality" question.

     That's about it. Any advice you can give me will be appreciated. We're
looking forward to driving the car in PCA/RMR (and AMR) events this late
summer/fall. We're even planning to make the trip to Monterey in '98. That
should be fun...

Thanks again for your help!
