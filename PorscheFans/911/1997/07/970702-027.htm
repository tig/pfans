The master cylinder will not cause a car to pull so I would wait on that.  
It sounds like you either have a front suspension problem or your rear left 
brake is not working correctly (assuming your fronts are at this point).  I 
would pull off your left rear wheel and give the caliper and rotor a good 
looking over.  Also jack up the front end and pull the front wheels off 
(yea again) and look and the struts, and tie-rod's comparing the 2 sides 
for anything that looks different.  If you didn't bleed correctly you would 
have a mushy pedal and should know it.  Did you bleed right rear, left rear,
 right front and then left front in that order?  I doubt this is where the 
problem is.

Good luck!

Thank you for everyone's help in rebuilding my front brake calipers.  There
were many ideas that created a great pool of knowledge to draw from.  I
believe the rebuild was successful.....but.....I just took the car out for 
a
test drive and unfortunately i still have the original problem (car pulls 
to
the right under very heavy braking.)  Any suggestions on what to check
next?????  I will be rebuilding the rear calipers next, but i don't think
that will fix the problem(just a guess).  Then i'm on to the master 
cylinder,
but i'm not sure if i want to tackle that project.  How difficult is it to
change the master cylinder?   Am i better off having someone do the work 
and
diagnosis versus me??  Question....I bleed the brakes by myself with a
Mityvac brake bleeder, is that technique just a good as the usual two 
person
technique?

Thanks for everyone's help,
