Richard,
They just work, O.K.? I too have had my share of $150. detectors and
they're junk compared to the Val 1 and the specific criteria I gave a
couple days ago.  Any of your points I could speak to at length but this
gets almost like religion.  
Just got back form a little trip that took me from the mid-west to 
several eastern states and back.  Quite simply, I got more of a kick out
of the trip using the Val.1.   I was through states where its illegal, 
never turned it off, frequently got it up well over 100 on nice mountain 
roads, had a blast enjoying the car & not  falling asleep @ the speed 
limet.
Of course it's not a "silver bullet" for blindly putting 'the pedal to
the metal', its just one more tool to play the game a little better.
Its a personal thing too.  I like to play the game. Also feel the states
should find a better way to collect their #%@ revenue.
Not sure what your "shotgun" is but photoradar is radar and in a slower
city setting I bet you'ld have some warning. I have no front plates and 
very dificult to read rear plates (part of the game).
There's plenty of good detectors out their. Val. 1 is just a little 
different in what it does and how it delivers it's information to the 
driver. Try one sometime, you might be surprised.    Gregg
