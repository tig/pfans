My 82 911SC has had overheating problems since I purchased it
last year.  When the weather is mild (below 75 degrees) I rarely
have any problems with oil temperature.  On a typical summer
day (90 degrees) driving at freeway speeds without a/c, it will
typically be at around 235-240 degrees.  If I turn on a/c or go
up any type of hill or do some spirited driving, the temperature
goes up to 240-245.  On the track on hot days, temperature will
climb to 250, at which time I bring the car in and shut it down
(usually 10-15 minutes into session).  From what I have read
and the people I have talked with at the track, these temps are
above "normal".

I have calibrated the temperature gauge using a temp probe in
the oil tank, and it is correct (corresponding to the
centigrade numbers hidden behind the gauge cover).  I replaced
the fender trombone cooler with a 34 row Earl's radiator
cooler.  I also recently added an electric fan to that cooler.
It now gets LOTS of airflow.  These additions made little
difference.  The O2 sensor outputs around 5.5 volts at warm
idle.  Seems reasonable, if not slightly rich.  Temperatures
are the same with or without the O2 sensor hooked up.  Timing
is ok, engine compression and leakdown tests are solid, recent
valve adjust.  Castrol Syntec 20-50 oil.

Took it to the Porsche dealer and spoke w/ their head
mechanic.  He is not sure of the cause, but did say that the
temperatures were abnormally high.  He said it could be the
engine oil cooler or thermostat and that the only way to check
those is to pull the engine.  He also said he had never seen
either item fail.

I would like to find out typical operating temps for SC cars,
or just position on the numberless gauge (driving conditions
and ambient temp would help).  What else should I check?
Could the engine oil cooler/thermostat be the cause?  I would
think that a problem with the engine cooler would result in
very rapid overheating.
