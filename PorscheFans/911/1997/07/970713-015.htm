P-Fans:

I have heard quite a bit about 2.7l engines and their problems.  However, I
just looked at a '77 3.0 today.  I went home and looked in all of my books
for any kind of info and found very little.  What kind of issues do these
engines have? Do these engines have thermal reactors?

Also, the car had turbo flares.  I do not know if it is a 'factory' or not.
Did they make turbo look cars in '77? Actually, I think that the rear flares
are fiberglass, but I could not tell where they were joined to the body so I
am assuming that the work was of resonable workmanship.

TIA

Michael
