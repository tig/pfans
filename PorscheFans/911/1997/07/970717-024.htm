Brian,

The early sunroof motors are noisy compared to modern cars.  The sun
roof should work smoothly. It also works quickly. I suspect the sticking
at the end you describe is an alignment problem. My motor sounds like it
straining a bit at the end though so it's possible your roof is behaving
normally. 

In the past, people have talked about the drive mechanism failing or
about leaks due to worn out seals (a previous owner replaced the sun
roof seals  on my car in the mid-80s).
I have not heard reports about noisy motors or motors becoming weak.

My advice is - if your roof does not leak and works quickly, I'd forget
about it.

Best wishes,

Bill
