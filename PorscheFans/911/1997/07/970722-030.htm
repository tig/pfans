Hmmm - I'll put forward an explanation of what I *believe* is happening,
though of course I'm not there so can't tell for sure!

First, Internet email works on what's called a "store-and-forward" system.
I.e., mail being sent from one system to another first gets stored in
a spool area, then forwarded on to the next system. Mail will sometimes
have to get stored and forwarded by 6 or 7 different systems (or more) across
the net in order to reach your mailbox. Once the message has been successfully
forwarded down the line, it is removed from the spool area on the
forwarding system.

In the event of a failure in the "forward" part of that, the forwarding
system just hangs on to it and after some predetermined amount of time
(usually 1/2 hour or 1 hour) it will go through stored messages again and
try to reforward what it's got.

The KEY thing is that upon failure of any kind, the receiving system should
NOT try to forward the message on to the next hop, but should instead just
remove it from it's spool area (the system upstream will send it again).

The PFans list server is not working quite properly in that it is receiving
messages, storing them, AND forwarding them to the list, but is in a couple
of occasions returning an error indication to the system that has forwarded
the message. The message still gets sent out to at least part of the
recipient list, but the system that had sent the message to PFans believes
it needs to resend the message, and it does so after that 1/2 hour or 1 hour
time period. And again. And again, and again, and again.

This has happened in the past, and SEEMS to be associated with messages
that get copied to ALL of the PFans lists. I don't know if the list software
breaks down when there's a large number of recipients or if there's some
other problem.

Unfortunately, the only way to break OUT of the loop is to go to the
admins of the site UPSTREAM of PFans and ask them to remove the messages
from their mail spool. I've done this already, but system admins don't
generally take kindly to requests from anonymous people to remove queued
email.

This is the kind of situation that needs active administration from the
PFans site itself - if they would contact the upstream site (which in
this case is at pacbell.net) and ask to remove the messages from the queue,
this would stop.

Sorry for the rant, and hope that helped!
