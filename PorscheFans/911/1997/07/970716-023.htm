Clovis asks a frequent question:

"From: clovis@cts.com
Subject: Shift travel in 85 911
When I'm accelerating, I'd like to shift a bit faster, will the shorter
shift kits really help? How hard are they to install? Also sometimes
getting into first can be hell! is their something wrong that could be
fixed when I change to the shorter shifter? i.e. kit to help shifter
travel into correct position. Newbie Porsche Guy.....Thanks all. MLB"

My advice is:  1) short shift kits are fairly easy to install.
2) neither the short shift, nor anything short of a G-50 transmissionplant,
will cure the baulkiness getting into first from a dead stop, though blipping
or double-clutching will make it a snap while moving should the need
actually arise (it shouldn't).  However, don't succumb to using too much
brute force, as an enraged right arm can actually bend part of the
mechanism in the transmission.  I don't like it, but one can live with it.
3) Don't think of the short shift as making your shifts quicker.  I think it
makes them more precise and easier to do efficiently, and I wouldn't
leave home without it.  But rapid shifts can wear out the synchros well
before their time.  The quick flick from 2 to 3 I was so proud of eventually
was accompanied by a sort of groonch sound which kept getting worse.
 The groonch started when the synchro ring wore partially out, and the
groonch was caused by the much more expensive engagement teeth
grinding on eachother.  I used to figure on spending $800 each time I took
a tranny in (usually several gears had problems like this - second from
downshifts, 3d from up), and that was with me doing the tranny removal
and reinstallation.
