Good advice but the 3.2 does not have the round plate & screen set up.  It 
does have a second drain plug in the case there which must be drained to 
remove all the old oil.

There's nothing special to a 911 oil change, except that the drain plug is
under the oil tank in the right rear fender area. The filter's easy to get
to, also, right there by the filler cap.

If the car is new to you, you may also want to drop the bottom plate under
the negine. That's the 3" round plate straddling the case halves. There's a
screen in there that might yield some useful information about how much
sludge there is in the engine, and whether any little bits of metal are
coming off anything inside. The screen needen't be cleaned at every oil
change, but certainly the first time would be advisable.

About the seat.....Hmmmmm, if the 6mm hex won't work at all, don;t try to
force it; the socket will just round off more. Get a pair of long-nose
Vise-Grip pliers, and see if you can get a grip from directly above. The
seat should slide forward or back far enough to allow this. Once you get
them out, have a new set on hand to use in putting it back together again.
Any dismantling shop should have some. Try Kempton in Florida, or
PartsHeaven. Both have 800 #s.

Good luck, and enjoy your (girlfriend and her new) car!
