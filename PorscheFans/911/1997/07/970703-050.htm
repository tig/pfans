For a while now, I've noticed a noise in the front suspension when I begin to
accelerate the car normally. I can only describe it as a moan and it doesn't
occur every time I start out. It seems to be related to the beginning of
motion of the car and stops at about 5 mph. Sometimes, I've noticed it when
slowing to a stop as well-at about the same speed. It doesn't seem to
correlate with either the brake pedal or the clutch. Today, for the first
time, when I did a sharp right hand turn into the garage the drivers side
wheel squeeled-sounded like the power steering squeel I've experienced with
other cars (and occurred when the steering wheel was turned to the right at
the max). I checked the manual and there apparently is no power steering
resouvour (sp?) like other cars I've owned.  I have some plans to drive over
the 4th weekend--should I cancel?  I'd appreciate advice as to how serious
this problem (s) could be and whether I should drive the car this weekend.
