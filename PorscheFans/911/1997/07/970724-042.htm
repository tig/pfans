I have an '87 Coupe that is also lowered and aligned reasonably close to
factory specs.  I am currently running Dunlop SP-8000 tires, which I like
very well especially when hot.  But I don't get the kind of response from
the car that you describe.  I can make the rear tires slide in a corner
either in power-on or power-off conditions.  In the power-on case, the
behavior is very smooth and predictable.  The car can "hang the tail" a
long way out before finally spinning, giving me plenty of time to gather
it back in.

In power-off conditions, things are different.  The infamous lift-throttle
oversteer seems much more abrupt to me.  This may be due in a large part
to my under-developed sense for this rear-engine tendancy.  I have to be
very deliberate in re-applying the throttle to control this skid.  But it
does not occur without warning.  The tires squeal away, again giving an
opportunity to control the car before spinning.  Its just that the driver
input to control this type of skid is unnatural to me.  (Its so unnatural,
in fact, that I tell my wife I must practice CONTINUOUSLY.  Every track
event.  Got to go to all of them.  It's really hard work, Dear...)

My best bet is that you're experiencing lift-throttle oversteer.  If you don't
have it, check out Hank Watts' book "Secrets of Solo Racing".  His writing
has helped me.

Practice, practice...
