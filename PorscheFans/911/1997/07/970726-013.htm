Hi Richard,

Sorry to see you leaving… I guess you're right, this thing has gone way to
far. I can't really see why people get so upset over a certain message
repeated a million times. Ok it's a drag, but heck, if they'd taken two
seconds to think about it they could have figured them selves what's been
going on. Some people just seem to need an excuse to get abusive I guess
(why don't they do this on one of the numerous stupid chat-things on the
net of subscribe to some of the perverted sites). Anyway, it's a sad thing…
I understood some people (Ross Parker) are trying to come up with a
solution for this evercrashing list-server as well as the Listmaster
himself (keep up the good work Jim), so I'll just hope & wait for that to
happen, maybe you'll get back on line when this happens… Well, I guess
we'll have to miss out on your wit and (TMHO) great humor. Thanks a bunch
for the laughs.

Bye…
