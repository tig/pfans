I had a good friend who worked for one of the gas companies in Colorado
who supplied gas to all the pumps....   He told me that the "Regular"
leaded
gas that is sold in Colorado has so little lead in it that it will
actually
pass standards for UNleaded.  (Probably also won't give your exhaust
seats
what they need, either!).  It was recommended to me to use a little 100
octane
airplane fuel with each tank -- they call it low lead fuel (low lead for 
airplanes, high lead content for cars).
