This morning my '75 911S crapped out at the top of a freway on-ramp. 
Feh.   Looks like the ignition is going south.  I limped it home and
biked into work.  Like a hole in the head I need this.

Symptoms are thusly: loses spark occasionally, which kills the car if it's
idling (if it's at revs, or moving, it restarts itself).  Once when it
died, I didn't turn the key off, and I got to watch the tach bounce 
between 0 and 8000 (engine is dead, fuel and ignition still powered).  
Also looks like some of the grease/dielectric is leaking out of the coil 
(or whatever it's officially called in a CD ignition)--and the damn thing 
is maybe 10000 miles old.  The points and plug wires are new, and the 
dist. cap is only a few thousand miles old.  The spring on the 
rotor-based rev limiter is OK.  CD box still whines.

Anyone have a good diagnosis?

This had better be cheap--I've just decided it's time to sell the car...
