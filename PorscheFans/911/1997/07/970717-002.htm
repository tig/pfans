Pfans:
Many thanks to those that helped with my pressure regulator diagnostics. =
 These included Bjarne's description of his regulator repair, Gary =
faxing me the  test procedure, Dave's offer of help and Joe's great lead =
to a CIS test fixture at a reasonable price ($56 from JC Whitney).  Test =
was easy and quick and for better or worse didn't show a problem with =
the warm up regulator and I've still got a lean burn pop.  Vacuum is now =
OK (might not suck a golf ball through a garden hose but much better =
than it was),   pressure checks good cold and warm & pump flow rate is =
fine.  Lean it out and you get an induction backfire.  Unless I'm =
missing something that pretty much leaves me the injectors.  Anybody =
ever have a bad injector cause something like this??  I guess it =
wouldn't hurt anything but my wallet to change them at around $25 each.  =
I haven't heard of any success stories on people cleaning them and don't =
know of a local source for a good spray test.  Any suggestions would be =
appreciated.
