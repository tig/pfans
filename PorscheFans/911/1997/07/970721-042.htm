Apology accepted.  Global Internet war has been averted.  The (mailing list)
bombers have been recalled.  You still, however, are required to take that
English class!

The next time some sort of server problem or other computer glitch causes you
to receive mail that you did not want, don't flame an entire mailing list
over it.  Actually, you could have sent it to flamers@porschefans.com which
has been set up specifically for that purpose.

Now back to the regularly scheduled Porsche content . . .
