     Is there a common leak that causes residue to collect on the cooling 
     fan housing.  Over the past few months, mine has gotten more and more 
     oily and yet I can't clearly identify the source.

     John, 
     Check your rear crank seal.  When this leaks, oil gets onto the crank 
     pulley which flings it around and gets into the fan, belt and inside 
     of the engind compartment lid.  You will see oil in the well of the 
     engine support around the crank pulley if it is leaking.  
     
     Believe it or not, this can be replaced without taking the engine out 
     of the car but it is a real challenge.  There is very little room to 
     work.  When I did it years ago ('85 Carrera) I think I had to make a 
     couple of special pry bars to get the old seal out.  SnapOn makes a 
     19mm offset box wrench (expensive, of course) that is just right for 
     getting to the bolt on the crank pulley.  I remember hearing that you 
     can support the engine, and remove the rear engine support frame to 
     give yourself more room to work.  Good luck.
