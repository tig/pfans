Sri,

Very serious issues.  Others on the list will likely have other and more
expert help, but I'll do what I can.

Are you sure you know how to check the oil level?  Warm motor, at
idle, level surface.  Use the dipstick (near passenger-side engine cover
hinge) until you're sure you can trust the dash guage.  Excessively
low oil MIGHT cause the excess temperature and low oil pressure.

Low oil pressure is DEFINITELY not normal. This must be addressed.
If the oil level doesn't fix it, have it towed to a mechanic.

Engine temperature is too high.  250=B0 is the point at which, according
to conventional 911 wisdom, motor damage begins.  If oil level doesn't
help, you'll need to investigate the current oil cooling system and=20
consider some modifications.  Unless you are driving very hard in
hot weather, the original system should keep the temperature well
below this.  Others need to help here, but my understanding is that
the '74 does not have the thermal reactor, but the '75s and '76s do.  Are
you sure this is a '74 and that someone has not added a thermal reactor?

Tranny fluid: drain plug is a very large allen-type.  Be sure you  can get
the filler plug out before opening the drain.
