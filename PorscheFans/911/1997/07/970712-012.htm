Following the advice by several members of this list,I successfully
replaced my clutch cable today and also did my first oil change. I actually
contemplated taking it in for the oil change but after the fine advice I
was given from the members of this list, the job was a snap!  I decided to
pick up a new shock for the rear trunk lid and that was also easy to
install and works great.  I bought my parts from Performance Products and
was very pleased with the price and speed with which I received them. You
guys (and gals) have really added to the enjoyment of owning a 75 Porsche.
Thank you!
