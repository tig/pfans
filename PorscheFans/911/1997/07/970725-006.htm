Gettin there aye?
                          Rear window- Targa SS cover removal..... Take the 
cover off via 4 nasty little stud/ nut combos under the 1/4. Then the 
glass, this sucks because of the wires that are interfed thru the rubber
and connect to the glass. Yes there is a connection thru a grommet
down into engine comp. However I leave the rubber in the car with
 the wires untill after paint and then go thru the grusome job of threading
the wires in to a new rubber with a razor xacto and silicone and a lots
%&$#%*&^%##$^%^ on what a pain in the butt this little configuration
is. On some cust. cars after discussion of course we just delete the 
harness, fair weather sailors! Oh yes another hint on rubber/wsheild
removal gently pry the alum mldng up and out trying to keep as straight
as possible, upward bends are not as bad as sideways, mark them as 
l/r and set aside up high and way out of the way!!!! Cut the rubber at 
the first ridge against the glass and pull (RIP) this strip off, the glass will
now push straight out with big PALM pressure, never your fingertips
and isolated pressure points. Now to put this all back in is another 
lesson and 20 clams ( jus'kiddin) when you are ready I will tell you 
how I goes about install. 

UNDERCOATING  *******************
                                 Do not fool around with anything but WURTH
                                  Say it, WURTH, again, WURTH
its the best , it has texture when properly applied and the right colors
Now I say that, however I have not asked for the biege in quite some 
time, and i remember spraying gas tanks etc. that color, I have scince
been using gray and black. A little research and ? could lead to what 
years, what colors of interior undercoating, I usuallly go with the 
achaelogical dig at the time, gently sifting thru the layers of many years!

VIN #s check with PCNA on getting new decals and or alum. plates
 i know the decals are available with a little effort, try the metal version
and let us know...and remember half the fun is just getting there and 
once your there ,what are you going to do next?
 cyall8R,
