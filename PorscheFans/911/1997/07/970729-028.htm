After driving about 200 miles up to Tahoe this last weekend, I did a
walkaround of my '88 Targa and noticed that the black rubber plugs in
the right headlight retainer ring were gone.  I looked closely and
noticed the screw at the ring's bottom was gone too!  Has anyone heard
of these items spontaneously flying off, or do you think the same punk
who removed my metal valve stem caps in the parking lot bought himself
a screwdriver?

The question:  I took the ring off for safe keeping until I can get
another screw tomorrow and noticed the rubber seal is a long strip
(with a break at the bottom of the light)  rather than a true O-ring.
Shouldn't this seal be donut-shaped with no break in it?  What's the
best place to buy these seals?
Thanks
