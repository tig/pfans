I am a lucky 914 owner, so can't comment 100% on the 70's 911 cousins,
but you might look inside the door where the threaded mirror
reinforcement should be. On 914s it was common on the passenger side
even if no mirror was mounted by the factory. If so blessed, you merely
have to punch the holes from the inside (gently, gently) and drill them
out. I forget who suggested this first.

> Ah, "cheap and nasty black mirrors" are the clue here.  Some PO installed them, not realizing that the mirror on the passenger side does not mount at the same location as the drivers side.  This is one of those neat little 911 quirks (like the wipers parking on the drivers side) that I really like, and most people don't even notice.

Unfortunately, this is for the later paddle-style electric mirrors, and I can't find any similar instructions for the early cars.  The driver's side mirror is mounted further forward than on the passenger's side.
