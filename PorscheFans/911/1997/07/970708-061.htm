this may not be common knowledge, but the limited slip in the 964C4 and
all 6 speed 993s (2wd & 4wd) have smarts to "reduce oversteer effects"  if
you lift off in the middle of a turn.  porsche calls it "dynamic driving
differential (DDD)" and there are electronics to detect lifting off in a
turn, which would cause the diff to lock up to 60% in the 993 C2 and 40%
in the 993 C4 to induce understeer to counter the oversteer effect. 

the locking ratio under acceleration is just 25% for the C2 and 40% for
the C4. 

not a well publicised piece of info judging by the lack of traffic on it
here.  $1200 for the 993's LSD sounds like a pretty good deal considering
how much it does.  i have not driven a C2 with and without this feature
side by side to report on how it performs, but if you are seduced by
hi-tech stuff, this is pretty attractive, having been directly developed
from the 959's ultra sophisticated AWD system.

tiptronic cars only have traction control available (applying the brakes
to a spinning wheel up to 44 mph), 6 speed cars have both TC (called ABD
in their marketing jargon) *and* DDD.
