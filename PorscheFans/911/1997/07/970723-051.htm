At 60,000 miles, you probably need a regular 30K service. As the valve covers
must be removed to adjust the valves, the oil change is done at that time,
along with a trans oil change, plugs, and everything else on the list.
Probably a good thing to let your mechanic do it all this interval.

I did my own oil change between the 15K services, and it was not a problem IF
you have a 12+ liter container that can take a lot of oil all at once. If you
use a funnel, it will overflow all over your driveway or garage. 

BTW, try 10 quarts for the original fill, and adjust accordingly. For the
small difference in price, I used a German oil filter.

I change my oil once a year, and typically drive 5,000 miles or less per year
(darned Insurance limits), with few short trips.

I tried Mobil 1, and found it tended to weep out of the valve covers onto the
exhaust manifolds, adding a fragrence to the garage that my wife didn't like
much. I went back to a synthetic blend the next time.
