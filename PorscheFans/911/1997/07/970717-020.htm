>Hello all,
>     My wife and I have just bought a 1973 911T w/CIS. The car is spotless
>inside and out. I have a few questions about it that I thought this very
>knowledgeable list could answer. Since we are expecting to pick it up
>tomorrow a prompt reply to my e-mail address or the list would be greatly
>appreciated.
>
>      1.) I understand that these cars ran leaded gasoline. A mechanic who
>   did the pre-purchase says that he can get       regular leaded here in
>   Denver. I thought they made the stuff illegal to buy at a regular gas
>   station. The salesman            (what do they know...) says you can run
>   high-test (91 octane +) in the engine with no problem. Since we are
>   about to     pick up the car and it'll probably need gas, who is right?
>   Can the early cars be run on unleaded? Will I need to run
>   unleaded with a lead additive (yuck!)?
>      2) The paint is the original code 114 (signal yellow) and is very
>   nice and all original (verified). The lower rocker        panels have
>   the "PORSCHE" script with stripes that is in pretty good shape but as
>   24-year-old decals are prone to            do they have
>   faded/cracked/yellowed a bit. There are a few rock chips and really
>   minor dents on the bonnet and         nose and a small scratch on the
>   passengers door. My question is this: Since the original paint is in
>   such fine shape   should we fix these small blemishes or leave them as
>   part of the cars "character". We aren't trying to build a
>   100-point concours winner but small stuff like this on any car bothers
>   me. Should I just let it go? If I did have the work       done it would
>   be at a professional restoration/body shop whom I have gone through
>   before and specializes in older       cars. I think that they would be
>   able to fix these spots, match the paint and install new decals without
>   harming the rest       of the originality.
>      3)Should we keep the car as a) original as possible b) original in
>   1973 options but not necessarily in what the cardex  says about this car
>   (i.e. add front spoiler and rear valence) or c) add what we want
>   (tastefully, of course). I guess the  question is should we keep this
>   car original and true to its cardex records (which we will be getting
>   from Porsche).         l'm leaning towards originality but that front
>   end does get light at over 100...     :-)
>      Clear bras - I have this on two other cars and they work great. For
>   those who don't know what they are basically it is a      clear tape,
>   cut to the car's dimensions and then applied wet to the
>   nose/rockers/mirrors/wheel wells. It protects        against bugs/rocks
>   and can be replaced without damage to the paint. Looks 100% better than
>   a vinyl bra and won't       flap in the breeze. My question is since
>   this was not something in existence in 1973 should we put it on this
>   car. I            guess this is another "originality" question.
>
>     That's about it. Any advice you can give me will be appreciated. We're
>looking forward to driving the car in PCA/RMR (and AMR) events this late
>summer/fall. We're even planning to make the trip to Monterey in '98. That
>should be fun...
>
>Thanks again for your help!
