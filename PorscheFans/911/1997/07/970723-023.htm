I have a pair of 993's, a 95 (wife's) and a 96 C4S. Both  
instructors for PCA. Have B and B as well as fabiani supercups. B and 
B triflows are very tame. Nice rumble at idle but by 2500 rpm they 
are about as quiet as stock. No performance increase noticeable on 
either car.

Supercups sound fantanstic. Removeable cores (one bolt, like a 
motorcylce) sound incredible, but too loud for street use with them 
out. Cores in the sound is awesome but if you make a lot of lengthy 
cruises you might not like the droning sound. For shorter trips, say 
100 miles or so no problem. No noticeable performance increase cores 
in. Cores out the car seems to pull a little harder over 4500 rpm but 
that may be due to the psycho sound <grin>. 

Note both systems are cat back and are legal. The oxy sensor is in 
the cat so you don't have to worry about it. The factory mufflers 
have no sensors in the either.
 
K and N does nothing for power increase. Sound may be a little be 
louder, hard to be sure. Cheapest is to remove the air box cover and 
drill a couple of 1.5 inch holes in it (nearest the front of the 
car). Increases air flow and increases the intake noise (moans at 
revs.. nice) like the engine sound package does.
