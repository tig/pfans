I'd like to add my $.02 in on finding used parts, though I'm new at
this.  I was looking for a used Carrera cooler for my 81 911SC and found
one one my third hit.  I first called PAR in NY and the used parts guy
wasn't in that day (?????) and he said he would call me back, never
did.  I called Parts Heavin in CA and when I told him I was looking for
a good used Carrera oil cooler he said "Ha!  Isn't everybody?" and told
me he didn't have any.  My third call was to dC Automotive in VT.  They
had one and told me the two short lines were bad, though, and I ordered
it.  After 5 days I called them back and they were very apologetic and
told me the first one they had they found a defect in and had to get me
another, and they were shipping it that day.  It arrive 2 days later
WITH oil lines that were in fine shape.  They also included 3 handmade
lollipops, which they also sell, with a note on my invoice that "they
are suckers for fine Porsches".  This extra step goes a long way to me
and I will call them first from now on to find used parts.  I
wholeheartedly recommend dC Automotive and their number is 800-579-2410.

Also, I now have two brand new factory short oil lines for the cooler
that I did not need.  I paid $115 for the both of them, I'll take $75
and I'll ship them if any one needs them.
