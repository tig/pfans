Hi Ronnie,

In your obvious state of agitation you have made a serious blunder.
Since you have elected to perform the internet equivalent of tugging 
on Superman's cape (one of those things you shouldn't do) let's see 
what is in store for you as suitable punishment.

First, the list needs to know what type of person you are, so here 
goes.  Courtesy of the 'Net, and a few select database accesses:

Ronnie is 19, he lives on the left coast, and he's a Scorpio.  He 
likes disco music (his folks must have played it while he was in 
the womb.) and he's a major Star Wars geek.  Several government agencies
indicate that they are monitoring him for political activities (c'mon Ronnie,
you don't think the government actually wants any of those libertarian
zealots to get into office and start dismantling the bureaucracy, now do
ya!).  He is a student (definitely not majoring in English).  He's also
pursueing a career in finance.  I'll bet that cashiers job allows you to
drive lots of fine machinery so that you can form legitimate automotive
opinions (about "porsches, cameros, and firarris).

Okay, enough fun.  Your first punishment shall be:

Next semester, you are required to take a course in basic English, including
spelling.  They do still teach that in California, don't they?  It's in your
curriculum guide between DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 103, and ESPRESSO MAKING 101.
 Check it out.

Your second punishment shall be:

A UNIX script.

Sounds exciting, doesn't it.

Well actually, the fun just begins there, because this script does 
some interesting things.  Since you have demonstrated to the 
thousands (between server crashes, of course) of Porschefans that you 
have no automotive taste, you have been forever sentenced to 
permanent subscription to all of the other known automotive mailing
lists on the internet (sans PorscheFans, of course).  Yes, sports fan 
(according to AOL, you like sports, and mock trials), this nifty 
little swatch of (non Java) code subscribes you automatically to automotive
nirvana, once per day.

This punishment shall remain in force until one of two things 
happens:  You issue an apology to all Porschefans, or your AOL mailbox
overfloweth, and your account gets shitcanned.

Remember, if you decide to flame several thousand people to 
demonstrate your tastelessness, you just might piss someone off.

Have a nice day.

-Captain Chaos
