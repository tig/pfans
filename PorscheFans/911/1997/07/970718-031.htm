Hi all,

While returning from a 60 mile trip today in my 86 911 my Valentine 1
started to power on and off by itself. Thinking the unit was defective I
shut it off. A little later I flashed my headlamps to pass and noticed
that when I flashed the lights my radio went off. I now figured that the
car was loosing charge. No warning lights were on. I did have the AC on.
I made it home and as I suspected the car would not restart..no crank.
After about 1 hour the car restarted and all apeared normal but I have
not driven the car again yet.
Is this an alternator probelm? battery? I have owned the car for 2 years
and the battery has never been replaced.

TIA
