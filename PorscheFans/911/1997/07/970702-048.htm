On 7/2/97, Hank Watts wrote, regarding the TT crash at Laguna:
	
The story I have is a bit different.  There were not only instructors behind
the car, but there was one in the car.  As the driver entered the turn, he
was going fast but believed that all was under adequate control.  The 
instructor (remember, BMW club, not necessarily experienced with the 
power or stick possible with a 911TT; also, California's BMW club has 
been refocusing their track events to less speed and has dropped some
excellent instructors who drive both Porsche's and BMWs) decided that 
it was not possible to make the corner, and grabbed the wheel to force 
the car cleanly off the track.  This (greatly!) surprised the driver who 
responded, almost involuntarily, by hitting the brakes as he left the
course.

Well, maybe it's just because I'm a lawyer, and primarily a litigator at that,
but if some instructor grabbed my steering wheel and caused about $60k
worth of damage in my car, I think we might be spending some time
utilizing our country's justice system.  One assumes certain risks when
one takes one's car to a driver training event at a race track, but not the
one that has been described, IMHO.

As an instructor myself, I can tell you all that I have touched the steering
wheel of a student's car for instructional purposes while it was in motion
and I wasn't driving, but only after a detailed explanation to the student
regarding what I was going to do and why, and receiving enthusiastic
permission from the student.  Also, and obviously, when this happens,
the student has been instruced to slow down considerably so the
instruction can be done safely.

If this story is accurate, I sure hope the instructor in question has been
treated like the Mkie Tyson of the racing community and has had his/her
instructing privileges revoked, at least for a while so things can be
sorted out.
