Was really interested in the beginning of the thread posted by Darrel a couple
of weeks ago about the Carrera speedo intermittently quitting - but didn't
notice any list responses (maybe they were sent back to Darrel rather than the
list?).

operates fine for the first 10 - 15 minutes - then kicks off.  After resting
overnight, the cycle starts again.  The problem is only occurs in cold (?)
weather (less than 45-50 F) has hasn't repeated since the warmer months
arrived. When the speedo/odometer cuts out, there are other circuits that are
dead too - like the windshield wiper delay (no delay, always on if the main
switch is on), the wiper motor doesn't come to rest at its stop point, the
cruise control is dead (never used anyway...).  Taken it to two shops and both
are mystified.  Checked the steering column switches, relays work and its
driving me nuts.

I have only recently joined this list, so did not see the previous thread.
Hopefully I'm not posting something that somebody already posted :-)

Anyway, my '87 Carrera exhibited the same symptoms as yours about 4 years
ago and started exhibiting the symptoms again in late Jan.  The fix last
time was to replace the speed sensor.  The shop that did it for me told me
that these things were known for going bad.  I don't know whether that is
true or not, but after replacement I had no problems until recently.
