Jim or Lynn,

First, if you can get ahold of it I recommend the August issue of
"Excellence"
magazine; Bruce Anderson wrote a very good article on the '74 -'89 911.
Earlier issues covered the earlier and later cars, too.

Briefly, when the first 911s were built, they were magnesium cases
(discounting
a few VERY early cars with aluminum cases).  For the initial 2.0  liter, and
later 2.2 and 2.4 liter cars, they were acceptable and durable.  From '74 -
'77
the engines were 2.7 liters, and this is when the trouble started.  The
engines
couldn't take the higher stresses induced by the 2.7 liter configuration,
partly
due to less metal in the case and partly due to the higher engine
temperatures
caused by emission controls.  In '78 the 911SC was introduced, with the 3.0 
liter aluminum block engine.  This has been a quite durable engine to my 
knowledge, all the way to the '89 Carrera with the 3.2 liter engine (first
introduced
in '84).  For info, the CIS fuel injection introduced in '74 and carried to
'84 is 
somewhat sensitive to fuel type and can occasionally be a problem with
warm/hot starts.  The '84 -on Motronic electronic fuel injection in my
estimation is a
much better running and more reliable unit.

I put about 105, 000 miles on a '76 911S; at approx. 70,000 miles, the engine

was burning and leaking oil badly and required a total rebuild.  When I got
rid 
of it the same problems were starting again.

I then got a '84 Carrera Turbo-Look which I sold with 125,000 on it.  The
intake
manifolds were leaking and the valve guides were worn to their wear limit,
but
the bottom end of the engine was fine.

For info, in '87 there was a major change in the transmission,switching to a
newer style with smoother, lighter shifting and a lighter clutch.  The tranny
in the 
previous year cars ('78 thru '86) was OK, but couldn't take the rigors of
heavy
use on these later higher torque engines (it was originally introduced on the
2.4
liter cars).

Hope this helps; good luck to your friend in his quest.

  Hi.  I'm jumping over from the 928 list to ask a question for a friend
who is starting a search for an early model 911.  He has heard that some
models used a magnesium block which was prone to overheating and could
subsequently warp at the cylinder head mating surface.  Could anyone
shed some light on this problem and perhaps recommend the earliest model
year that should be considered to avoid such problems?  TIA.

(P.S. a direct response to my e-mail address would be appreciated since
 I'm not a regular on the 911 list.)
