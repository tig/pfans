Todd:

No reason why you shouldn't be able to change your own oil.... BUT.....

The key part of the 60k service (actually every 15k) is a valve adjustment.
 If the engine is drained of oil BEFORE removing the valve covers, much
less oil is lost to the garage floor (BTDT)

In my opinion,  have the shop do the whole service including the oil
change.  For changes between services (at 3k, 5k or whatever interval you
choose)... do the work yourself and save the bucks then.

Good Luck,
