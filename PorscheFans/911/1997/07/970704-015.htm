I bought the "generic" kit from Vertex.  I had the shop install them
while they were rebuilding the engine, and they never said anything to
me about them appearing inferior or anything.  I have not had any
problems with them in the 11 months and 2892 miles since they have been
installed.  My opinion, is that the big "color catalog" vendors just
charge higher.
