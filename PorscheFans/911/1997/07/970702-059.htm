new one.  It would have to have laser, because these Western New York cops

use it sometimes, and also have VG-2 detection because I drive in Canada at

least once a week. >>

Rick, I have had three Escorts (Escort 3-band corded, Solo 4, and now the
newest cordless Solo) in the past 6 years and I have loved them all.  The
Valentine One is supposed to be the best detrector on the market, but it is
expensive.  My Solo is cordless, has all bands of radar plus laser, and is
mighty compact.  I also like being able to take it from car to car with no
trouble (I've bought 4 windshield clips to make things easier and keep the
windshields cleaner).  The police around here don't like me very much.  Can't
imagine why.     =)
