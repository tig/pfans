Hi,

I am new to the list and must introduce myself.  My name is Jouko Haapanen
and I am presently living in Finland, working as GM of our family Audi-VW
dealership.  I moved back to Finland after living in Canada from 77-91.  

I don't presently have a Porsche, and here is my dilemma - where can I find
a good 71-72 911?  Why those years? Well, as the taxation here is set up,
it is next to impossible to import a used car unless it is 25 years old
from date of production.  If anyone can suggest whereabouts to start
looking, how much a good car (for driving - not for show) should cost etc.,
I would appreciate the help.  Obviously I would prefer an original "S"
coupe, no flares/spoilers/fuzzy dice, but as this is an "extra" car for the
garage, I do not want to pay myself silly.

It seems that the $6000-7000 range is common, but as I am here, where I
cannot seem to find a good early seventies car, I cannot judge if these
maybe generally better than the few here.

Yes, I will have to arrange for shipping etc, but that will get sorted out
in due time.

Please reply by posting/e-mail if you can help.
