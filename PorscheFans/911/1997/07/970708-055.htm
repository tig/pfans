<<2.Super wide band and 360 degree sweeps are only effective if the radar 

is left on or pointed at a car ahead of you. If the cop is 'gunning' 

each car with short bursts, and you're up front... you're toast.>>

I agree with most of what Richard has said in his post, except for the above
statement.  Radar detectors aren't supposed to be and have never been
foolproof.  They have never been advertised as being the end all be all to
avoiding tickets.  They are merely tools to be used in conjunction with smart
and alert driving.  My Escort has detected radar up to 1.5 miles ahead of me,
and if the policeman is using instant on radar ("gunning") my detector will
always pick it up and produce a faint signal, albeit enough for me to realize
that there may be something ahead of me worth slowing down for.  You can't
plug in a detector and keep your foot on the floor.  You also have to drive
intelligently.  Watch cars ahead of you and slow down if you see them
suddenly braking.  Pay attention to where your detector does and does not
normally go off.  The only ticket I ever received because my detector didn't
alert me was in 1989- and the officer was using laser (before laser detectors
were a thought).  He was the only officer in the state of Indiana qualified
to use laser... lucky me.  Anyway, just thought I'd add my thoughts.

P.S. My K-40 front/rear mounted detector in the 928 came with a one-year
guarantee for the company to pay any speeding ticket that I received- in
full.  They are very expensive detectors (up to $700 base price not including
the install), but I think well worth it.  They must think that their product
works pretty well to offer such a "warranty"... and to be honest I have never
even been pulled over once in the 7 years I've owned the car.  Hmmm...
