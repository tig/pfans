Jeroen, I installed the Autothority kit in my '84 Carrera several years a=
go.
 This
involved the mass flow sensor change and the replacement of the chip in t=
he
ECU; also a small jumper wire had to be added, but you keep your original=
=20
ECU.

No power change was noticeable until you got above approx. 5000 RPM,
after which the change gave a noticeable but not overly dramatic power=20
increase.  In  actuality, the biggest benefit was the greater ease of acc=
ess=20
to the far forward cylinders (plugs, valves) on the right engine bank, pl=
us
the=20
greater ease of changing/cleaning the air filter (get a K&N filter with t=
he
kit).

Disadvantages? Two main ones:=20
(a) had an intake whistle at very light throttle when starting from a sto=
p.=20

(b) the wiring from the mass flow sensor to the old engine wiring harness=
 was
 very cheap. There were three wire ends coming from the sensor which you
were to stick into the appropriate ends of the wiring harness connector
leading
to the old air flow sensor and tape in place.  I got an old dead sensor f=
rom
a=20
junked car, cut out the connector portion, then soldered the wire leads t=
o
the=20
back end of this connector.  This gave me a nice harness connector on the=
=20
sensor leads that plugged professionally into the engine wiring harness.

Am surprised that your sensor is bad; are you sure you don't have an=20
air leak at the connection between the intake manifold and the head?
I have been told that this is common on these engines as the gasket
dries and shrinks with age (mine were getting bad at 125,000 miles).

Hi,

Turns out I'm having some trouble with the air flow meter in my '87 carre=
ra
(some slight stu-stu-stuttering @ 2500 rpm). Well it's not that annoying
(yet) that I'm willing to spend $400 on a new one, but in the everlasting
process of gathering P-info (I'm no wrench, I didn't even know what an ai=
r
flow meter was or did) I came across a device that replaces the air flow
meter. It was mentioned in the latest issue of 911 & Porsche World. This
device uses a 'hot film' or 'hot wire' and nolonger has a moving airflap
(this mechanical part is the one that causes the thing to fail). There's =
an
English firm that provides it (FilmStar) and I saw something likewise in
the Performance Products catalog. I believe there's also one from
Autothority. These little dingies come with a new ECU and are supposed to
deliver 20 extra hp's. They're pretty expensive ($ 2,000 compaired to $ 4=
00
for a regular air flow meter) but the extra hp's are kinda attractive (wi=
ll
we ever get enough?). Does anybody on the list have any experience with
these things, are the worth the extra bucks and do they deliver the hp's =
as
promised?
Well, I'm looking forward to any comments=85
TIA
