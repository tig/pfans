Hi,(I think the list was down when I sent this yesterday. )

I guess you'll be depressed to hear that Goodyear may have made your
Dunlops, they have an agreement with Sumitomo to make Dunlops in North
America and vice versa, saves on shipping costs. 
BTW I have a set of Eagle GS-C's and find they are one of the better
tires I've tried.
