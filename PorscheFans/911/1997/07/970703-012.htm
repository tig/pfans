Eric, 

I had the same problem on my 993. It is a known problem and the 
dealer should know about it. If not, a call to the PCNA hotline will 
get them the details. The good news is that you will get it fixed for 
free and with a little luck, you'll get a new clutch out of the deal 
too. In my case the jumping caused damage to the 2nd and 3rd gear 
cogs as well as scoring of the clutch plate.


Andy and Hank,

Like you, I've always wondered what the best technique was to keep 
the braking system cool. My theory is that a shorter firmer braking 
technique is better. The amount of kinetic energy converted to heat 
is the same. By building the heat more quickly two things happen. 
Firstly the rate of cooling is related to the differential between 
the hot parts and the airflow to them. The greater the differential 
the more efficient the cooling process. Secondly the brakes will 
have more time to cool down before the next application. 

Contrary to the above, a more gentle braking technique may result in
less heat because you can corner faster with a car in balance than 
one which is nose down ....that being the case you use less brakes 
and create less heat.  In sum I get a headache thinking about it 
<grin>..

Best cooling aside, I prefer to apply brakes gently at first to
flatten the contact patch then increase the braking force smoothly
but firmly.  The real trick is to release them gently just before
turn in so you don't have the car standing on its nose which greatly
reduces cornering speeds.  This sorta sounds like a combination of 
both and my headache is still going strong.
