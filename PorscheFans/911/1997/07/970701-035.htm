Brian & those new to the list,

I think most 911 owners remember their first oil change and the
"13-quarts".  First I'll say that you are right that changing the oil is
fairly straight forward, now having said that I point out the differences.

The oil tank in the 911 holds the majority of the oil.  When you remove the
drain plug, about 8-quarts drain in 30-seconds.  Few containers can handle
that flow rate so you end up with a lot of oil on the ground.  Next,
remember to drain both the oil tank and the crankcase (it holds about 2 - 4
quarts).

Then remove the oil filter.  By now, most of the oil has drained from mine,
but again you can expect a mess.

When re-filling the car, I suggest adding 9 or 10 quarts to start.  Then
start the engine and check the level and correct as necessary.  You don't
want to overfill it nor do you want to underfill it.

Good luck,
