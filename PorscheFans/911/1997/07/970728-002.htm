Nigel,

Even if the drain is working properly a collection of dust and pollen 
in the evaporator tray can result in a stink after a while.  The 
ideal solution is to clean the thing. It isn't easy. Here's a trick I 
learned from a local mechanic which works for me in a variety of cars:

Start your car. Close all windows and doors. Set the AC or heat fan to
HIGH and RECIRCULATE.

Take a big can of Lysol Disinfectant spray and spray it back and 
forth into the air intake (just ahead of the windshield on a 911 and 
most other cars). Spray it continuously until the can if empty. Let 
the car and fans run for another 10 minutes or so.

Sometimes a second application is needed, but this simple method has 
been effective at removing the swampy smell.

18 Wheels on a 993

Going to 17 or 18 inch wheels will not change your speedo and odo 
readings if you use a wheel tire combination which is the same as the 
factory supplies. As the wheel diameter increases the tires profile 
is reduced to provide the same rolling diameter and circumfrence. 

I suggest you think twice about 18 inch wheels though., Tires in that 
size are relatively scarce and cost a mint of money.  My C4S came on 
18 inchers and I bought a set of 17 inch rims for track use.  The 18 
inch Bridegestone S02's cost about 40 percent more than the 17 
inchers due to the lower volume and demand. Next season, Goodrich 
will have 18 inch track tires for the 993 but I bet they cost a lot 
more than the presently available 16 and 17 inchers.
