Darrel,

I'm sorry to hear that the new sensor did not work.  This one is a
puzzle to me.  Let us know when you find the true failure.  I
think we will all learn from this one.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne

Porschephiles,

I have taken the list's adivse about my non-working speedo issue and
bought a speedo sensor for my 87 911.  It was put in yesterday by my
Porsche wrench, and lo and behold, the damn speedo still don't work!

Very disappointed, and a little mad for seemingly spending $ 100 for
nothing, I drove home, since the wrench was at a loss and told me to
come back Monday, so he can put an oscilloscope on it.
After driving about 15 miles, the speedo suddenly started to work as
if nothing ever happened.  This morning, however, the speedo was dead
again. Incidentially, this is how my problem started; sometimes it
worked, sometimes it didn't. Looks like I am back to square one.

Do any of you have any other tips as to what else could be causing
this intermittant problem?

Thanks,
Darrel
