What is a fair asking price for a modified 1972 911 RS?

Originally it was a 911 S, and modified to RS. Added (1) 1989 3.2 Carrera
engine with about 250 hp, with custom chip, air, race headers, sport
muffler. Also (2) race suspension with new shocks, torsion bars 29 and
24mm (3) new clutch, (4) transmission, (5) CV joints, (6) brakes, race
pads, new rotors, calipers, stainless steel brake lines, etc. (7) rear
flares (8) 16" wheels with wider tires, (9) repainted (10) precision
steering components, (11) roll bar and race seat, harnesses, etc.

Car is perfect for drivers ed or PCA racing, but is also street drivable.
Just 5,000 miles (mostly highway) since rebuild, so it is a new car
except body. Lightweight car is 2400 lbs, so 0 to 60 in less than 5
seconds. Power to with ratio is excellent, (1.04) equivalent to about 320
hps with 3200 lb car.

Your suggestion about pricing would be helpful. 
Thanks, Jim Stephenson
