Hi PorscheFans, 

I've got a 1979 911 SC 3.0 litre 142,000 kms (88,000 miles) Guard's Red
Sportomatic

I don't race it even though I have a permit for sprint racing (CAMS
license)

I live in the Northern Territory in Australia in Darwin.  It's a
tropical town with lots of beautiful scenery and a population of less
than 100,000.  We get lots of tourists (terrorists!) through Darwin and
a good proportion of them are Germans.  I've managed to bump into a few
of them and one of them worked in the Porsche factory (in Stuttgart?)
for a while.  She was cute too.

I know that Sportomatics aren't the darling of the racetrack but as a
business transport they're superb.  First gear handles anything from
0-100 km/hr (0-62 miles/hour) without using the redline zone, second
handles anything from 0-170 km/hr (0-106 miles/hour) although it's
slower away from a standing start of course, and third handles anything
from 0-260 km/hr (0-162 miles/hour) and it's definitely slow off the
mark.  Sportomatics can be used as a comfortable "automatic" type of
drive - that is, stay in second all day, or you can use the 3 gears to
get around quickly.  There aren't many cars in the Northern Territory
that could beat me I don't think.  We've got about 30-40 Porsches in
Darwin - half of them 911's (from early 70's to new), a couple of
Boxsters, a few 928's, a couple of 944's and yes we even have an old 924
or two floating around (I'm glad I've never had one)

The GOOD NEWS is that outside the city limits we have a NO SPEED LIMIT
zone that stretches from Darwin to Alice Springs (half way across the
country).  So, with a few exceptions you can wind your car up to the
limit of it and you and go for it.  The road down south is called "The
Track" so going south is known as heading off "down the track".

The BAD NEWS is that the road is not free of obstacles.  There are
little eagle hawks that eat the road kill and there are lots of
kangaroos that hop into sight at random.
With the shape of the 911 front end aerodynamics you are literally
inviting anything that you hit to share the front seat with you so it's
"driver beware" or CAVEAT DRIVOR!

We get Ferrari, Ford, Porsche, Mazda, etc all coming out here with their
new cars to thrash them off down the track for endurance and heat
testing.  We also get Boeing bringing aeroplanes here for similar
reasons but that's another story/site/FanGroup.  (The new Boeing 777 was
tested in Darwin and Alice Springs last Xmas.)

Last December, as well, we had the new 996's (heavily disguised) coming
through, making use of the local Porsche Dealer (Morgan's Motors) for
minor repairs.  At the Boxster Release here the Porsche sales executive
was a little sheepish about admitting that the new 996's were here but
our spies were at work.

Anyhow, see you on the Net and I look forward to communicating.  If
you're coming out here come and say hello.
