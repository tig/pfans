It sounds like the problem is shift fork alignment.  This is rare, but one
of the forks may have loosened, and is preventing the selector finger from
selecting the correct fork.  I wish I could tell you there was a quick fix,
but if that is the problem, the tranny will have to come out of the car.  I
would carefully check the gear shift linkage.  Take the coupler off at the
transmission, and see if you can manually put the transmission though the
gears.  If you can't, the problem is internal to the box.

The early 911, and the 914 gear boxes are the same, except for some
differences in the clutch cable and the shift linkage.


Original message:
My brother is having trouble with the transmission on his 69 911E.  All of
a
sudden it became impossible to find some gears.  I first thought the
problem was
related to the bushings on the shift coupler.  These were replaced with no
improvement:  Still can not find neutral, first or second. We have tried
adjusting the linkage with no success.  

Q: Does the transmission (or some component) need rebuilding or is there
something I am missing ?  

We also have a 1974 914 (body poor, very good interior and mechanical,
26,000
miles, any buyers ?).  

Q: Will the transmission and/or any components of the 914 tranny fit the
911? 

Thanks in advance,
