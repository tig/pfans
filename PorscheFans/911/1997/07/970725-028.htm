Glen with a 70 Targa 2.7 and a 70 Coupe had a '69 style flwheel in one 
come loose.  

I built a 2.7 race motor, and had flywheel bolts come loose (same
symptom Glen had - one worked out far enough to hit clutch disc so it felt
like clutch wasn't fully disengaging) with a later style flywheel.  This is
bad news, as in one case metal transferred from crank to steel flywheel,
ruining end of crank.  Next time it  happened with new crank (I thought I
just hadn't tightened enough somehow) metal mostly transferred from
cast iron flywheel to crank, and its end could be machined smooth again,
although it had to come out to do it.  Both flywheels junk, of course.

1) Seems like the 66mm cranks don't have problems unless you just didn't
get the torque.  I am dubious that "ordinary" used bolts will cause a
flywheel to come loose on this crank, at least on a stock engine.  If the
bolts and threads weren't cleaned and lubricated  (which loctite should
do) some, the torque on the wrench will not be the effective torque
(stretch) of the bolts, which could possibly account for the problem.  If a
bolt is really stretched beyond its limit, it won't torque up again, will it?  It
will just keep stretching below the torque you want until it breaks.

2) Word is that the 4th order harmonic of the 70.4 crank is at a high point
right at the flywheel mating surface, which means they want to shake
the flywheel off even when everything is perfectly balanced.  (don't ask
me what a 4th order harmonic is, though.  In one of the Upfixn's there is
a diagram showing the harmonics of a 917 engine - the null point was
right on the gear at the center of the crank where they took the power
off, which meant it was so well balanced harmonically they could reduce
the oil pressure.  the 70.4 is a far cry from that, it would appear).  On
stock engines this isn't really a problem if properly assembled.  When I
ran a stock 2.7, probably not entirely properly assembled, the flywheel
stayed on with a redline of 7000.  This flywheel problem drove factory
nuts on their race engines running at 8000 or maybe more.  Rumor is
they put in new bolts every day (night, more likely).  One guy tack
welded the bolts.  Didn't work.  People have tried dowel pinning, and
wedge mating.  The books say the factory tried a harmonic damper.

3) Two years ago Bruce A shared with me his fix for the 70.4, which
has worked for me since:  Use red loctite and torque to 150 ft/lb.  Yes, I
know 105 or so is the spec.  But if you want to go above 7000 rpm, use
150 ft/lb.  Haven't broken a bolt yet, going in or coming out, or shaken a
flywheel loose again.  Stands to reason you need new bolts for this.  It's
scary.  My 12 point Allen socket is long, so I prop the working end of the
torque wrench on a jack stand adjusted to bolt level to keep everything
lined up while pushing down, and breath a sigh of relief when I get to the
torque.  Excellence had an historical article about 3 months ago which
led me to believe some US mechanic came up with this fix (using green
hematite - might that be loctite?) way back when on some factory
engines for Sebring or Daytona and bolts stayed put, but factory couldn't
figure why it couldn't get the bolts back out.  Wish I'd know of this fix
before learning the hard way.

4) My 66mm setup works fine to 8000 with standard torque, and it
sounds like the 66s just don't have this flywheel problem, although I now
use a bit more, like 120 or 130, since I know the bolts will handle it.

5) Loctite should not be necessary on a stock setup, but can't hurt - red
anyway just makes disassembly a bit harder.  I've thought of green
sleeve retainer, but it appears unnecessary and red is hard enough to
disassemble.   If you use it here is a system:  a) clean the oil off your
new bolts b) clean the threads in the crank end - brake cleaner, loctite
clean and prime, something which leaves no residue.  I like to run a clean
old bolt in and out several times as part of this process to help clean it
out c) put the flywheel on dry and snug down all the bolts d) remove one
bolt, give it a little dab of locktite, run it in, and torque it down.  repeat with
rest of bolts.  this makes sure you don't get any loctite on the mating
surfaces, which have to be clamped together.  loctite is not as strong as
steel and you don't want it in there.  Motor wizard Ed Mayo down in
Texas said he's known people to lap the mating surfaces together to
insure maximum contact before assembling.

6) given that the stock 105 ft/lb bolts will torque to 150 just fine, why
throw away bolts torqued only to 105?  Yes, the factory manual says
don't reuse.  If I was in the rebuilding business I'd use new bolts
because even if the customer asked me to reuse the old ones chances
are he'd forget that if something went wrong, and would blame me.  Fact
is, though, lots of folks have reused the bolts for stock engines, and
nothing bad has happened (then again, here is Glen wracking his brains
trying to think what he did wrong because his came loose, although he
doesn't tell us all the details).  On the other hand, unless you know the
history of the bolts, how often have they been reused, etc, you can't
make a very educated guess as to when it is time to retire them.  All bolts
stretch - that is how they develop clamping force.  What is important is
keeping the stretch below the elastic limit, so that when they are relaxed
they go back to their previous length (which you don't know, in this
case).

Of course, the other thing the 70,4s did at racing rpms was break at the
rod journals.  The racing cranks had larger radius fillets to try to stop this.
The only broken 70.4 of my acquaintance was used for time trialing, but
not above 6500-7000 per its owners.  Knock on wood, but there are a lot
of guys out there in PCA class 4 and SCCA GT-2 who spin ordinary
70.4s to 8000, and crank breakage doesn't seem to come up.

Walt Fricke (would you trust advice from a man who told you how many
things he had break on him?)
