Hi Harvey,
I put H4s on my 83. I like the looks of them much better, and the light
output is better. I stayed with the 45/55W bulbs. I had tried a set of
80/100W, but became concerned about overloading the wiring and switch.

The ones I got used came with black painted crackle-finish brass rings.
I had them painted to match the car. The shop took the gas filler door
and kept it to match the color, did an excellent job.

They were a major PITA to mount. I wound up taking them to my favorite
wrench, even he couldn't get them on. Went back home, took everything
apart again, tried mounting just the ring. It was a matter of rotating
the rubber gasket to get the proper fit. They snap into place with a
faint "click", and only a few threads of the retaining screw (brass
also) engage.

All in all, a nice upgrade. H1s would give the separately adjustable
high and low beams, with an increase in price.
