My next door neighbor had his clutch cable snap, 1983 911SC Cabriolet,
and he asked me to help him.  Among other things that I have never done
on a Porsche this is one of them.  I have the Chilton's book and the
manuals on microfiche.  I have found where the cable connects at both
ends, but I have not even seen the replacement cable.  First, how do we
disconnect the cable in the footwell?  The adjustment looks very
straightforward once the cable is back in, but, how do I get the cable
to go back up through the tunnel.  Which way do we pull it out?  do we
attach the new one to the old and pull it through.  I assume that the
cable and housing come as an assembly?  Is my coupe exactly the same as
his Cabriolet?  We already removed the floor from behind the pedals for
access.
