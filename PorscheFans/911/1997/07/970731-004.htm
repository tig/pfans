Several past postings have asked about experiences with short shift
kits.  I am 6'2" and installed a short shift kit on my 73.5 to reduce
the reach required to get to 1, 3, 5 with the seat far enough back to
accomodate my long legs.  I rejected the glue on end change option (mine
was welded in place by a PO so wasn't removable anyway) and purchased
the Weltmeister kit which includes a new shift lever and the required
spacers, bolts, etc.  Unfortunately, in addition to a shorter throw
ratio below the pivot point, the shift arm is also shorter above the
pivot point so I wound up with about the same reach to 1, 3, 5 with a
stiffer and much notchier feel.  I didn't like it and took it out a few
days later.  Any P-nut who wants it is welcome to my complete
Weltmeister kit for $50 + UPS.
