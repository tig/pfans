THe answer is......Maybe. You should insist on a pre-purchase inspection by
a highly qualified mechanic who can put the car on an alignment rack and
see if the unibody has been racked out of alignment by the crash. If it has
been, walk away.

If not, have the mechanic check out the engine mounts for any visible signs
of movement. If the seller admits to "kissing the rail" it's likely
something more was involved. Look for any signs of re-straightening or
replacement of the rear semi-trailing arm on the suspension, ditto the
shock absorber on that side.

As to the body stand at the front of the car, head level with the fender,
and sight down the side. Any ripples or unevenness in the front fender or
door means that the "kiss" went further than the rear fender. You don't say
which side was hit. If it was the right side, have the mechanic look for
signs of repair to the oil tank, which is located just inside the fender at
the right rear.

Price sounds fair if the damage is confined and the body isn't wracked. at
122k you'll figure on about $2k worth of "stuff" to get fixed in the first
year. A Clutch is probably the first order of business, followed by CV
joints, brake rotors and pads, shocks...........

Good luck with it! They're wonderful to drive.
