And be careful when working around a running engine!! Getting caught in
a moving belt or fan could be disastrous. Remove and replace the filler
cap with the engine off. Don't wear loose clothing such as neck ties,
scarves, unbuttoned sleeve cuffs, etc. And be very careful with that rag
you are going to use to prevent oil from dripping off of the dip stick;
keep it wadded up in your hand so that none of the rag is hanging loose.
I've seen people get hurt in machinery (not p-cars though) and it is not
a pretty sight. Of course, with a little caution this procedure is a
good deal less dangerous than driving the car at high speed.

You can add oil with the engine off, but you will need to turn it back
on to recheck the level. On my car it seems like there is about 3 quarts
between the low and high marks on the dipstick, so adding oil in one
quart quantities is safe. However, unless the level is really low (like
off of the dipstick), don't add more than a quart between level checks.
That is, measure level with engine running, turn off and add a quart,
restart and measure level. Repeat until the level is between the bottom
and top marks.
