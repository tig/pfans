The guy rebuilding my engine told me specifically NOT to use the tow
hooks for trailer tie down.  He told me about a guy who ripped the hooks
out after he hit a bump.  It's better to strap down the wheels and
suspension components fixed to the wheels.  This way the chassis is free
to float on the suspension.  It's probably OK to pull it up on the
trailer by the hooks though, as long as you keep the cable taught and
don't jerk it.  Mine were rusted, so I had no choice but to push it!  

Just my $0.02.
