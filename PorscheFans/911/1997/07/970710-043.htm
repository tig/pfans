     Last year,after a long term body restoration (7 years), I had the 2.4l 
     engine and Weber carbs in my '73 911T rebuilt.  I've put a total of 
     3,000 miles on the car since then.
     
     I've experienced several problems with the carbs - ranging from lean 
     miss sputtering up to running on 5 cylinders below 3,000 RPM.  My 
     engine rebuilder has worked with me to increase the idle circuit jets 
     and eliminate the sputtering but the non-functioning idle circuit 
     problem keeps coming back.  At this point it looks like one has some 
     dirt in it.  A new fuel pump and filter were installed at rebuild, and 
     a new fuel filter was installed at about 2,500 miles.
     
     Shear distance between the engine rebuilder and myself prevent me from 
     going back to him often - the flat haul rate runs into the low $400 
     range one way.
     
     My questions are:
     
     1.  Are the Weber carbs that finicky?  What should I expect?  Is a 
     once a year tune up enough or do they need attention every time the 
     weather changes by 10 degrees F?
     
     2.  Are there any good Weber carb guys out there in Southern Indiana 
     that anyone can suggest?
     
     I prefer posts to the 911@proschefans.com list rather than direct 
     email.  Seems like there is better info sharing that way.
     
     Thanks for your help.
