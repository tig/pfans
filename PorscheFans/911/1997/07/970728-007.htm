Steve,
I have Bilstein shocks in my SC.  I don't find them to be too harsh (even on
our wonderful CT roads :) ).  They were there when I bought the car, so I
can't really compare them to stock equipment, or any other brands, or offer
installation tips.

P Fans,

	I recently discovered that my 85 targa needs new rear shocks (slight 
evidence of fluid around both). I think it would be best to replace all 
four shocks since the car has 78K miles. Do any of you have any 
recommendations? I've only had the car for about 7 months and would like to 
start participating in Drivers Eds and autocrosses (if I can find any in my 
area). I think I read here that the "sport" type shocks from Koni and 
Bilstein are too harsh for street use. Are the Koni adjustables a good 
alternative? Where are the best deals for shocks? Lastly, the rear shocks 
appear to be a straight forward replacement, other than getting to the top 
mounting nuts in the engine compartment. However, I have no idea how to get 
at the front struts. The Haynes manual does not give clear enough 
instructions (at least for me). Can someone give me any insight on how to 
do this or is this job better left for a pro? Thanks for any info/hints you 
can provide.

Steve
