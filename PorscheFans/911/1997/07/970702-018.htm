 You bring up a good point. Custom wheel sellers should be able
 to get wheels from manufacturers other than those they routinely stock
 and display. I doubt NTW stocks the Borbets but ordering them is another
 matter. However, I didn't check with them since they have been a bit
 higher priced then other local retailers on the same items when I have
 priced things before. Maybe I would be pleasantly surprised. At any
 rate, I would love to see their quoted price on your wheel set compared
 to others. Also, my ROH wheels are probably harder to get as they seem
 to be a lesser known manufacturer.

 Sorry for all the bandwidth on this topic, but hopefully the information
 will be useful to someone.
