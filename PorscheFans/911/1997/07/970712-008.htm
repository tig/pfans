     Jeff, Pfans,
     
     
        My experience converting from a 5 blade to an earlier 11 blade fan 
     was that it is most important that the outer pulley half match the 
     fan.  My pwrench, who sold me the fan, told me that I could use the 
     outer pulley half that came with the 5 blade --- WRONG!!  The outer 
     half failed from over heating the first time I drove it for more than 
     an hour.  The belt was trying to turn the fan at one speed, and the 
     outer half at a different speed.  The result was constant slippage 
     overheating, and a failure of the  pulley outer half that left me 
     stranded for a day on the way to a drivers ed event.  The pulley half 
     you use should have 8 large holes equally spaced (not the one with 12 
     holes in 4 groups of 3 you currently have). 
     
     
        The original belt size fit the 11 blade fan (I don't recall what 
     size that was).
     
        Good luck,
