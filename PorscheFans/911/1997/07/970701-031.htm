Hi, I am a 944,914 guy, I have a chance to buy an 88-911 coup with 122k. 
The car is clean and has seen a bunch of track events. The driver kissed 
the rail and had the whole car repainted. I talked to the shop and they 
said it was just the rear fender, but being black they could not match the 
paint etc...

It has a slight oil leak at front of motor (Rear of car) and his mechanic 
said it has been a slight leak for 6 months and it may be the front oil 
seal.

Interior is good, and tires are Comp. ZR-1's on 16's.

The deal is 15k as is.

I don't know it this is good or not so any advice is welcome.

Thanks
