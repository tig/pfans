Hi Michel

The solution is to find someone who actually takes the time to properly
balance your wheels. I find regular tire shops in general have kids who
were working at McDonalds yesterday now attempting to install your
tires.
Someone who knows what they are doing should be able to balance without
putting weights on the outside. Sometimes this is impossible due to bent
rims or badly balanced tires but usually it can be done, it's just
easier to put them on the outside.
Most tire jockeys spin the wheel once and then put the weights where the
machine told them and never recheck if this is right. Usually it isn't.
The guy who mounts my tires will spin the wheel and use masking tape to
temporarily hold the weight in place and will spin it again and again to
get it perfect. He doesn't put weights on the outside unless he cannot
balance it from the inside.
You may be hard pressed to find someone who will do it properly as it
takes more time and care.
