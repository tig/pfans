Hi Folks

While I'm not going to argue against using 93 octane in a 930 there is
no need to use much higher than recommended octane in your car. Octane
doesn't affect how clean or efficient your car runs, additives may.
Race teams use higher octane because they are using more boost and or
higher compression ratios. Plus they are at WOT a lot more than you can
be on the street.
Higher octane allows you to make more power if your engine is designed
to use it, but it doesn't give you more by itself. Don't throw your
money away on octane boosters or racing fuel unless your engine needs
it.
Of course I may be saying this because 93 octane is about $0.45 a gallon
more than 87 octane in my neck of the woods.:-)
