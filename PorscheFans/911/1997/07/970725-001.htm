  I had the same symptoms on my box several years ago.  In my case, it was
due to worn dogs on the first gear set.  When a torque was applied, the
dogs popped out.  I suspect you are looking at gear replacement, then.
   For me, it was even worse.  Some fraction of the dogs sheared
completely.  I then had too much shrapnel coursing about in the tranny, and
this caused a lot of collateral damage during the 2-mile limp home.  I had
mine rebuilt u$ing all new part$, and the re$ult wa$ a very nice $hifting
box (but expen$ive).  If I had it to do over again, I would have swapped in
a rebuilt unit from PAR or someone like that.
