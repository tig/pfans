Encountered a problem w/ my sunroof today. When I tried to close it, it 
wouldn't move and made a loud popping noise as the motor strained to push it 
forward. It appears as thought the right side is hanging up somewhere. I 
finally got it closed by pulling on the right front corner while my wife 
operated the switch. But it still won't close fully as the right rear corner 
is not flush against the roof. (BTW, tried to use the hand crank, but the 
little screw that covers the handle hole on the crank cover wouldn't turn 
and I stripped it). Anybody know what is likely wrong and how much I'm 
looking at to get it repaired?
