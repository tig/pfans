This is a good question that a LOT of us would like answered.  It seems
to vary from insurance company to company.  Now, I have State Farm and I
was involved in a track "incident" two years ago.  I was driving a Neon
back then and my left front hub decided to separate on me during a
driving school.  This resulted in the wheel rolling off in front of me
while I ground to a halt on the lower control arm (luckily, on one of
the slower corners on the track so I could drive straight off into the
grass.  The wheel banged around a few moments in the wheel well and bent
up the fender and my rotor disintegrated, since the center part of the
hat was still bolted onto the wheel.

I called State Farm and did not lie, but did not voluteer anything
either.  During their investigation, the tow truck driver said he towed
the car from the raceway, so State Farm wanted to know if I was racing. 
The well worn R1s on the car looked like slicks to them.  I was quick to
point out that they were DOT approved tires and were just pretty worn
out, I guess.  They even questioned the fact that they were oversized. 
My original size is 185/65/14 and I had 195/60/14 on.  Finally, they
asked what, in fact, was I doing on the racetrack and I simply
responded, "I was attending a driving school" and that was the end of
that.

It was deemed an accident due to mechanical failure and not my fault, so
it came under comprehensive and not collision.  State Farm does not pay
for the failure part, so I paid to replace the broken hub and the
resulting bodywork damage, alignment, new wheel, rotor, etc. was paid
for by State Farm.  I did not get a new R1 to replace the scuffed tire,
but I didn't want to push it.  I'm sure this situation would have been
VERY different if I had slid off track due to driver error.

Amusingly enough, a month after this happened I bought my 1981 911SC and
took it to State Farm for insuring, so they could take the obligatory
pictures of my "new" used car.  I don't know what they will do when they
see this car now with a roll bar in it and two 5 pt. harnesses attached.
