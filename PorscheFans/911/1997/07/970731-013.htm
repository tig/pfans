No service on my '78 911SC has given me as much payback lately as taking a
quick look at the clutch spring and operating levers at the (915)
transmission end of things. 
Following the Haynes manual, I dismantled the dry but otherwise well working
operating and adjusting levers, as well as the auxiliary spring at the
transmission (piece of cake). 
I washed everything but the o-ring in gasoline, liberally applied high-temp
moly wheelbearing grease to all metal friction interfaces, especially the
needle bearings and in between the three leaf-springs of the auxiliary return
spring, after prying the individual springs apart with a screwdriver blade;
then I remounted everything.  

Finally I adjusted clutch play to the prescribed 1mm gap at the stop lever.  
Now the clutch operates smoother through its whole travel and with much less
leg muscle effort. 
If no re-lubricating was ever done to these parts since the car came out of
the factory, this work is highly recommended.  It was a very pleasant and
worthwhile return for about 1 hour of light duty screwing.
