Anyone with a '84 - '89 911 should save this message as it's easy to fix,
anything but easy to diagnose...

As some of you may remember, I was having a problem with my right side
parking lights not working - actually, they worked with the ignition off,
directional to the right (Euro parking mode), but didn't work as running
lights when the headlights were turned on.  The fuses and bulbs all
tested fine.
 
The culprit is a diode which is connected in-line directly behind the
headlight switch.  It's connected to a thin grey wire with a red stripe -
the diode (p/n 911.617.108.00) is enclosed in a long, rectangular, clear
plastic case with a VW logo on it (go figure).  For testing purposes a
connected the two connectors together with a thin jumper cable - the
lights worked.  Tomorrow I'll stop by the local dealer and get the
replacement diode.  Can somebody remind me what a diode does???

Thanks to Keith Burrell for the thoroughly correct answer.
