What happens with engine numbers in USA?
I've been trying to buy a 3.6l motor for a few months now and every 
time they are checked we find that the engine numbers have been
restamped.
I mentioned this to Porsche mechanic here in Australia and he said that
most of the American pcars engines that they work on have been
restamped. Does this really mean they are stolen? or could there be
some other reason.
Just interested....
Thanks
Darren

78 911 soon to have 3.6l 
ps
Have a 3.0l motor WITH engine number in Calif. for sale.
Various panels, interior and wheels also for sale. Email for more info.
Would like it to go as one lot. But smaller lots considered. 
May consider interesting trades.
