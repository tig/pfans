James:

 The Weber IDA 3C series carbs have 3 basic caveats. They are VERY 
sensitive to fuel pressure, float level, and dirt. Once these are set up 
properly, they will need very little attention for a long time.

Webers are far more sensitive to dirt than American carburetors, hence
most technicians have problems. First, make sure that the engine 
insulation pad is in good shape and not flaking those little black 
"crumbs: off. That will play hell in keeping the carbs free of dirt.
You can restore order to the idle circuit by removeing the idle jets 
holders and draining the float bowls with the drain screws, remove the 
main jet holders. Remove the brass screw over the progression holes. 
Using a soft-tipped air blow nozzle, gently blow air back and forth 
between the idle jet hole and the main jet hole for each respective 
barrel. This will flush out the microscopis dirt that is plugging up the 
idle jets. Blow out each main jet and idle jet. Replace all jets and 
don't overtighten anything. Use new copper washers if you have them.
Make sure that you have a very high quality fuel filter such as the 914
plastic one.

Remember, these carbs are just great, they need to be supplied with 
clean fuel. They will not "pass" any dirt at all. Any and all small dirt
particles are deposited into the idle circuit passages and that's what 
is causing your problems,(IMHO).

Let me know how you do.
