Adam,
The B-K piece is a pleasure to view and to use. It is precisely made and
meticulously finished. For belts, Dave Turner Motorsports in San Diego
(800.854.6640) sells a nice kit using Simpson equipment that includes a 6
point harness with all the hardware needed to install in a 964 (such as a
94 RSA) using the stock belt mount points and without any drilling needed.
Just be sure to tell them exactly what seat configuration you have (i.e.
power assists, sport or stock or ?). The Simpson set provides good quality
belts and an excellent cam-lock buckle, and Turner includes the proper spec
eye-bolts, washers, etc. for the full job. (std. discl.- just a satisfied
customer)
