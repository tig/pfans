 Question to the list.

This passed winter I replaced the pilot bearing in my fly wheel (69 type)
and used the same 
bolts, it wasn't until after the motor was back in the car that I read in
Bruce's book about 
replacing them with new ones. Well the first time out with the car the
motor developed a 
grinding noise. Thought it was the tensioners, turned out to be the fly
wheel bolts had come
loose and one of them was rubbing the clutch plate.
I'm now armed with "new " bolts and before I install them I wanted to ask
the more "experienced"
members if I should " lock tight" them in or just torque them in. I'm kind
of gun shy now after 
having to old ones come loose so quickly.
Thanks in advance.
