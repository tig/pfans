This is for tk zeus.wustl.edu.... and anyone else with similar 
questions.

FWIW:

 A very important question has been raised here. Tires, being expensive 
and consumable, are the single most important factor in how a car 
handles. Before one makes the decision about what to buy, one must make 
sure that the suspension works correctly to see the greatest gain from
the tires you choose. Something about the order of Carts & Horses :^)

This question was raised is such a manner that suggests that the 911 may 
be lowered near, or onto its bumpstops. When one cannot ascertain when 
breakaway occurrs, this to me, is potentially dangerous. At least the 
sheet metal is in danger. Beauty being in the eye of the beholder, some
cars look very "cool" but that have been lowered too much for safety, 
let alone good handling. There is already excellent information 
available about where the ride height should be and how far 
the fenderlips can be above ground, depending upon tire/wheel size. One 
quick way to determine if you are too low is to observe the front A-arm 
from the front of the car and notice the angle of the arm. if it is 
level(at the bottom side) or slightly points up toward the wheel, it is 
too low without some suspension modifications. If the A-arm points 
slightly down toward the wheel from the inner pivot, then everything is 
OK. 

The rear of the car should sit slightly higher than the front. We like 
the car to sit 1 to 1/12 degrees slightly nose down for rake. This 
ensures that the rear has adequate travel and alignment range and that 
the overall drag and lift coefficients are at their minimums for using
factory-type spoiler packages.

Without being there, nobody can determine exactly what the problem is 
here, but we have spent a LOT of time un-doing somebody else's work to 
raise a 911 back up, rebalance and align to make it drive correctly 
after somebody made it look real "cool".

Just our 2 cents worth here. Questions answered gladly,...all part of 
the service :^)
