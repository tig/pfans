> Sorry for the slow response...haven't been on line for a few days!  
> Thanks for the info also.  
> When I lifted the carpet I found some flexible metal fasteners which 
> hold some other wires (you may have seen them they are a flat ribon of 
> thin painted metal welded to the car at one end). I used these to secure 
> the cable for the changer, plus a few wire ties.  Since my changer faces 
> forward I ran the wires around the back of it and then under the seat 
> rail support (where you'll see the other wires going).  I followed the 
> other wires along the tunnel up to the fire wall and I ran them up under 
> the wood foot rest (or whatever it's called) until they exited under the 
> dash and then over to the receiver.  I coiled the extra wire up (most of 
> it) under that board.  I still had a pretty tight fit with the 
> receiver's wires under the dash but wires ties and electrical tape did 
> the trick and it looks professional.
> It may have been somwhat easier doing the connections Blau to Blau but 
> it was pretty much a no brainer with the instructions.
> Let me know if you have any other questions or how it turns out!  One 
> other thought, if you want to keep your tools pristine buy another hex 
> wrench or socket to remove the seat rails, mine got a little torqued by 
> the tight bolts.  Eric.
