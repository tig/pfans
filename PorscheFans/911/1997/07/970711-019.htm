I want to express my appreciation, and a huge "thank you" to all the
list members that put up with my questions, and offered their advice and
tech tips regarding r&r'ing my dashboard.  Thanks, guys, you saved me a
ton!

I finally got up enough courage last night, and armed with the
collective knowledge of this list, "did the dashboard".  I removed the
glass and r&r'ed the dash in about 2 hours.  I haven't put the glass
back in yet, as I got side tracked cleaning all the newly exposed nooks
and crannies.  As an aside, I used a product called Vinylex to wipe
everything down when I finished....good stuff; I recommend it.

I suggest having another person around; preferably somebody with small
hands.  There were a few spots where my wife's small hands came in very
handy, as I just couldn't get my big paws in a couple of places.
Also, a long extension for your ratchet driver is very handy, as is a
universal joint.

I found a service that will come to the house this weekend, and install
the windshield for me for $45.00, so I think I'll go ahead and get it
installed and sealed properly...8^)

Here's the payoff:

Estimated cost, parts and labor, for r&r by shop:  $880.00
(Includes dyeing a factory black dash to match)

Total cost of doing it myself:  $225.00

Dash from an 83SC (in my color) $130.00
Window seal                     $ 45.00
Reinstall window (labor)        $ 45.00
Nylon dash pegs                 $  5.00


Thanks again!

John D.
