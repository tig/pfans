I have painted Porsches as a hobby for 16 years.  First of all, find out
what kind of paint the shop plans to use.  There is a wide variation in
durability of paint from brand to brand.  If you do not get a top quality
paint system, your top will fade fast even if it looked perfect to start.

Since you are repainting an entire panel, matching with the rest of the car
should be easy.  The better paint suppliers have color matching equipment
that is far more sensitive than the human eye.  The match is with the
unaged factory paint.  Matching of paint on the rest of the car depends
entirely on the degree of deterioration of the original finish.  If the old
finish is in reasonably good condition, the match should be near perfect. 
Try looking at protected paint inside the doors or under the gas filler.  
If you see a difference in color with the paint on the flat sections of the
car, that is the degree of mis-match you will have on the sunroof.  I would
recommend against "blending" in with the rest of the roof.  This sounds
like the formula for disaster.  Good luck.  Let me know how this works out.
