Hi Ross,

These comments apply only to the 1989-1994 C4.

I have not had the impression (on the list, at driving events, reading
books, etc) that the C4 suffers much from reliability problems from the
additional drive train mechanicals. There are clutch plates in the center
differential that do wear, but it must not occur at a rapid pace. I don't
personally know of a C4 that has had to have that service done. The only
caveat I am aware of is that in some cars, the front differential can leak
gear fluid. Drop the front underbody tray to check it out.

As for handling, the C4 suffers from severe understeer in high G low speed
turns. This is a 'feature' of the car intended to prevent spins, and can be
prevented by keeping light pressure on the brake pedal during the maneuver
(keeps the computer from locking the differential).

The C4 is also heavier than the C2, though 1st and 2nd gears are lower in
the C4 so 0-60 times are about the same. You can feel the additional weight
in the front of the car if you drive a C2 and then a C4, but it gives the
car a slightly more 'solid' feel than the C2, at the sacrifice of some bit
of nimbleness. But it isn't very much.

If you are going to race your car, or regularly participate in track
events, I would suggest a C2. A C2 will be easier to throttle steer, and
you will have a greater range of tire options, since the C4 requires front
and rear tires to have almost identical circumferences.

For a street car that may see adverse weather and bad road, the C4 is a
good choice over the C2.
