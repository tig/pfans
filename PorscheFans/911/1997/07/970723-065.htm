I have done two rebuilds myself (amateur garage mechanic).  There are two
special tools you can buy for a reasonable sum.  There is a need to set the
preload on the ring gear, and this is very trickey.  Most shops do not do
it.  They just mic the old shims, and replace with the same size, and then
hope for the best.  I would quiz the shop on how they set the
pinion-to-ring gear load.  Porsche has a very expensive special tool.  I
have a trick that works well: put a  light coat of blueing on the pinion
gear.  Assemble the trans, and trun the gears.  The scuff marks on the
blueing should be at the center of the pinion gear helix.  If not add or
remove shims and repeat the process.  This is a lot of work, but I cannot
afford the special tool.  Good luck.

 P.S.  Parts for a complete rebuild cost about $400.  Labor should be
another $400.  For $800, they should do a very good job.
