Hi P-guys & galls,

About repainting the sunroof;
Think I'm entitled to give some advice here, 'cause I'm pretty close to the
fire…
A friend/client of mine runs a (very good if I may say so) body shop, which
painted 3 of my cars, including my current 911. With me hanging out there a
for years & years and doing a lot/most of the prep work on my own cars
(sanding, fixing little dents & other minor stuff…).

Mixing the paint with the rest of the roof doesn't seem the right thing to
do in your case…
This technique is mostly used for small fenderbenders when costs have to be
kept low and the job has to be done fast, therefore mostly applied to the
suburban-slob-car (no offence). 
A good bodyshop can do it right though, but I wouldn't have this done on my
car, and I surely don't think you should do it on yours, especially since
the roof doesn't need  painting! 
Any good bodyshop is able to make a good color-match and any decent one
will do the job again if it turns out not to match, just as long untill it
does!

Some other paint recomms:

If any of you are thinking of having your car repainted, have it polished
afterwards! This means that after the paint job (but before reassembly) the
entire car is sanded very lightly (just taking of that new shine and any
unwanted dust in the paint) and then the car is polished untill it shines
again. It'll cost you some extra bucks, but once it's finished, GET OUT
YOUR SHADES!!! The surface of your car will be so mirror-smooth that you
will be able to detect even the slightest pimple on your forehead from a
mile away 8^)

You can save some bucks by doing some/most/all of the stripping/rebuilding
yourself (heck, if I can do that, anyone can!!!). It's fun to do too. If
you can't/don't want to do this yourself make sure they strip it completely
(tape-marks will always show and end up being more of a pain in your *ss
than you might think).
 
Sanding it yourself is not adviced, unless you REALLY know what you are
doing, you could do more damage than good in this department. So it'll cost
you more instead of less…8^(

When looking for a bodyshop, don't just call, get in your car and go have a
look! Check for your self how the work is done there, look at how it's done
and look at the results of their work.
A decent bodyshop only uses filler to fix minor dents & scratches, not on
the major dents! 
Good work will cost you, but if you can afford it/are willing to spend it,
the results will show for it (and isn't that what you wanted in the first
place)! Also your P (or other special) car deserves it!
