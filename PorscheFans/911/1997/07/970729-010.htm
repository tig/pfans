The shooting star logo is the tipoff. The wheels are 'Etoile', French for
Star. These are similar to Gotti wheels.

The distributor used to be in Huntington Beach. They may not be in business
anymore. I can't find a number for them.

There should be either 28 or 40 allen head bolts. Try 90 ft./lbs.

And be careful not to damage the wheels. There were very few spares around,
last I checked. My 928 convertible came with a set, one of which had a
bbent inner... I had mine straighened by Tru Wheel (800) fixarim
