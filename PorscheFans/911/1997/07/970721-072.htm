From a previous post :


I am planning to take my 87 coupe in for an alignment.  I have noticed that
my Yoko's A008Ps are very thin on the inner sides of both front tires.  The
rears are wearing well (just have completed two track events at Mosport). 
I've got about 30k kms on the rubbers and feel it is time to get the car
aligned due to the uneven wear of the front skins.

I was told that I should take it to a reputable shop that has experience
with aligning Porsches.  The alignment machine should be a drive-on unit
with computer control.  I also was told that car should have a full tank of
gas, and the meticulous shops will even get the driver to sit in the
passenger seat?  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Since most 911's are quite stiff a driver doesn't affect the alignment to a
noticeable degree
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

How about getting the car weighed on all four corners
after the alignment process?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Corner balancing MUST be done before the alignment
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

What am I looking at in terms of cost for such a job?  I was also told
since the 911 is uni-body construction (which cars aren't these day) and
that a regular alignment is necessary for these cars?  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Actually, almost every car is a uni-body. Things like trucks and vans use
body on frame construction. Unless the car hits a big bump an alignment
should do you for a long time. If you get it right and the tires are
wearing good don't touch it until tire wear changes.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Should I have the shop put in the turbo tie rod ends (considering
purchasing 
them) prior to the alignment and have the whole sequence done at one time?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Again, get any work done to the suspension before the alignment
