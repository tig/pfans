I am currently looking at a water damaged 911 Targa- 1987 . The car came
from Florida and was totaled due to a flood. I called the guy up and he
knows very little of the car - as by now the car was a repo from a bank
loan gone bad. Ruff live hugh.

The car looks fine and runs. The interior looks normal so i must assume
that they swapped everything inside. The exerior looks ok with one of the
front fenders having a slightly different color then the rest of the car.

The engine looks fine with a slight oil leak on the  valve covers and
slight oil residues on the heat exchangers - from valve cover i presume. I
have not seen the car run since when i was there nobody else was around.

Can anybody tell me what too look for. What are the typical problem areas
with water damaged cars. How is the engine/transmission affected by water
damage. How about the wirring - the ECU seems to be ok.

Any insight appreciated,
thanks,
gerald
