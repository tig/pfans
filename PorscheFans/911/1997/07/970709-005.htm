<pre>
you asked to learn more about thermal reactors.  the t-r's were the german's
(low cost) alternative to catalysts.  bmw's of the same era also used t-r's.
 the idea was to intentionally run a rich fuel mixture, and add supplemental
oxygen into the reactor via the air pump.  this caused the "afterburner"
effect.  all that extra heat worked it's way back into the heads/valve
guides/valves/etc..  
as you can imagine, intentionally running a rich fuel mixture did not help
gas milage, which was also a concern in the mid-70's.  
don't forget that catalysts of that era were mostly of the pellet style,
which added a lot of backpressure to the exhaust.  so perhaps the germans
were also trying to keep the bhp numbers up there by using thermal reactors?
 with the newer honeycomb catalysts, backpressure is kept to a minimum over
the life of the car (assuming one doesn't melt the catalyst thru misfiring),
so hopefully most of us will resist the temptation to remove the catalyst.  I
worked for a major mfg. of auto catalysts for a few years, so feel free to
hit me with any other related questions....
