Pfans:

I've noted some discussion on tensioner update procedures as of late.   

 The information given was fine and I would only add the following words   

of caution.  Set the engine at #1 TDC before you start and make sure you   

match mark the cam sprocket to the cover.  Wiring the chains together is   

fine but if they jump they are more likely to jump at the crank sprocket   

and with the match mark you'll see it and can correct it before doing any   

harm.  Happy wrenching.

To add to what Terry wrote ---

Another reason to set the engine to TDC:  If you set the crank to TDC for #1
while doing any left side cam work, you place the cam in it's most stable
position when cam chain tension is removed.  When doing right side cam work,
place the crank on TDC for #4.  If you leave the crank on TDC #1 while doing
work on the right side, the right side cam is in an unstable position and
when you remove the chain tension it is likely to twist on it's own, making
the return of the chain to its proper place on the sprocket more difficult.
 There are other positions for the cams which provide some stability, but the
TDC position is easiest to find.
