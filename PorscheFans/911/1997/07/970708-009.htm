Yes, a fix is possible.....  My high beams would automagically come on
after using my turn signal or hitting a bump in the road.  Embarrassing
at times.  A "person" in a Olds Cutlass figured I was flashing him to get
out of the way.  He flicked a cigarette butt out of his window at me, did
a crash maneuver into the right lane and then proceeded to tailgate me
after I passed him.  When I entered a left turn lane, he attempted to
intimidate me by nearly broad siding me.  (idiot) 

Anyway, remove the steering wheel which will give access to all of the
screws holding the switch cover housing ( four behind the wheel and one
on either side of the housing near the turn signal and windshield wiper
controls).  Then remove the screws that hold the switch on the steering
column.  It is not necessary to unplug the switch, but you should
disconnect the battery prior to beginning work.  If you look at the
switch, you will see some relay contacts that appear to be <<very>> close
to each other.  These are the only contacts visible  without
disassembling the switch.  VERY carefully bend the arm of the outside
contact to increase the gap between the contacts to about the thickness
of a flat toothpick.  Use a tweezers, small needle nose plier or perhaps
a metal pick and bend the arm near the point where it attached, not near
the actual contact.  You can then operate the high beam switch to
visually verify that it makes and breaks contact like it should.  Put it
all back together and enjoy.  8^)
