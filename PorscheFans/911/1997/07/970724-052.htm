I am considering purchasing a 76 911S Targa for parts. I will be keeping
the engine, trans, fuel tank, targa top, wheels, dash with gauges, and
front brake calipers. The car is complete but has some serious rust. The
engine, fuel tank, and dash with gauges have been promised to a friend, but
I have seen no firm commitment. However, the car has numerous quality
parts. New front fenders, rust and dent free doors and hood, all suspension
parts, all glass, good interior, and much more. My budget can not really
fit it in. I am looking for someone in the St. Louis area that would like
to take what is left for a good bargain price, or share the cost of the
purchase. The door posts are severely rusted, but the rest of the car is
pretty solid. It had an engine fire and everything around it is burned. It
is a great car from the door posts forward. 90,000 miles!  I will part it
separately if necessary. Here are some sample prices. $100 each for
complete doors with glass. $100 for the hood. $135 each for the new front
fenders which could be reproductions. They seem to fit well though. $65 for
the windshield. $125 for the rear glass with defogger. $75 for the fuel
tank. $140 for the complete dash with gauges. $40 each for rear calipers.
$30 each for rotors with hubs. I have some very nice rebuilt non S calipers
for the front at $50 each. All of these items are in excellent condition.
Offers would be accepted on remaining items. I wont have the car for at
least two weeks. Im trying to line up potential sales to offset the
purchase price.
