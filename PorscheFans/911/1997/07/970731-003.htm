Hi Jeff & Linda:
There are a lot of shops putting these pans in and charging all kinds of
money. Stoddard makes a nice reproduction pan and fuel tank support
piece (you will need both pieces) for arround $275.00 plus shipping &
handling.
These pieces are nice enough to look original if done by a competant
body shop.  Some shops like to short cut the pan because it is quicker
and easier.  This is fine as long as the short cutting occurs under the
fuel tank together with a nice neat butt weld and not at the front of
the pan where it joins the front body panel.  Additionally there is two
reinforcement pieces PN 901.501.409.21 that should be welded on prior to
welding the fuel tank support.  Most shops never put these additional
brackets in, either because they do not know about them or they don't
care.  Once the fuel tank support is welded on you will never know
either; but if you want your car to have the original strong factory
structure, all pieces should be included including the tow hook.  About
95% of the time the tow hook is not rusty and can be cleaned up and
reused.
   Mig welding or the proper type spot welding or combinations of both
should be used for all welding.  Stay away from the brass users.  
   I usually charge between $2,000 & $3,000  (parts included)to do this
job depending how much surrounding sheet metal has to be fabricated and
repaired.  Factory sheet metal is galvanized and fits beautifully but
will add about $450.00 to the repair.  Included in my price is completed
undercoating with factory rubberized undercoat painted to the original
color or whatever color you might want and rustproofing of all interior
channels; and I do put back the tow hook! Good luck and do not put this
off too long for rusty suspension pans can be dangerous.
