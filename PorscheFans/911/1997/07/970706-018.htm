    You haven't, Harley.

    "Carrera" is Spanish for "race"; it was first applied to
    Porsches after the Carrera Panamerica, a race across Mexico.

    There were Porsche "Carreras" before there were Porsche 911s; the 
    earliest Carreras were 4-cam 365's, back in the mid-50s.

    In the early days, the "Carrera" name was only used on race cars
    (and homologated street cars like the early-70s Carrera RS's and
    RSR's)... It didn't become a generic street-car model name until
    1984, when the 911 Carrera replaced the 911SC.  Since then, all
    911s have been called "Carreras".
