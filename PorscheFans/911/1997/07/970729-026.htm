I recently purchased a 72 911T. The car had been sitting for 5 yrs. (Idont
even think the guy ever started it)  It was in a garage so its in perfect
condition. I have one major problem though. It wont run after it reaches
opperation temps. (180-190 degrees). The engine back fires and feels as if
its running on only 2 cylinders. Its loses power then eventully stalls.  Then
if i let it sit and completly cool off it runs again (untill it warms up
again)  I had all the fluids changed in the car, and changed all the filters
+ screens. funny thing about this problem is that I had it to a Porsche
dealer to correct the problem. They again drained the tank (they believe its
a fuel supply problem) cleaned the screens and put about 5 gal. of gas in the
car. It ran fine idrove it all over and it was fine. Then I filled the tank
with gas and the problem resurfaced.   If anyone has any suggestions I would
greatly apperciate them 

Thanks
