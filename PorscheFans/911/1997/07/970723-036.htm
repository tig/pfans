Hi all,

I am starting to research the 911 market for a future purchase, probably
in the coming 3 months or so, and I am looking at 80/83 911 SCs and
early carreras (well, 84 only!). Well, that's pretty much what all that
I can afford (I am selling my GTI VR6 for this). 
It seems that on all classifieds, targas come cheaper than coupes. That
I don't understand. What's wrong with them ? Is the top leaking ? Is the
car less solid with a T top ?  Other problems ?  I am personnaly more
attracted to the shape of the coupe, but I thought a "hair in the wind"
car like a targa would actually be more expensive ! If they are cheaper
(and they seem to be by one or 2 grands for comparable cars), maybe I'll
get one after all.. Advise, please !  ;-) 

Thanks !   Greg.
