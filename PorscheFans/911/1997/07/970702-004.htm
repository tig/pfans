Sorry for the late reply to this but I just saw the same car at the body 
shop when I went by today, which reminded me of the original question 
below.

It looked pretty messed up: right rear tire collapsed nearly face down to 
the ground (!), right rear corner all torn up to and including the 
melted-cheese tail, torn metal all along the right side up to and including 
the right FRONT wheel arch.  The body man told me it's estimated so far at 
$42k NOT including the replacement transaxle or engine case.  Total repair 
will be in the low $60s!!!!  Oh, and it has 2310 miles on the clock. 
 Apparently the insurance company is covering this since it was at a 
Driving School event!

I had talked to a couple of BWM instructors who were behind him when he 
went off.  The consensus is that he early apexed turn 4 with too much power 
on the exit, dropped the two left wheels into the dirt at the exit of this 
right hander, and instead of "driving" it off like we've all been told he 
jerked the steering wheel to get back on, and the resultant double spins 
and 200 yd slide ended with him dragging to a stop against the inside wall. 
 I was at Laguna two weeks after the accident and thought I saw a longgg 
silver streak along the same wall.  Haven't spoken to the poor fellow 
directly though.

Subject: 	911TT crash at Laguna Seca

This past weekend there was a BMW Driving Event / School.  I
heard that there was a guy there with a new 911 Twin-turbo
(approx. 3K miles) who lost it and totalled it into the wall
on turn 4.  Was anyone there who can give more details?  Just
wondering.  That's ALOT of $$$$.

Keep Porsching, (not crashing)
