First of all, the mechanic working on my car is at a Pcar dealership
($69/hr),
so maybe I'm the idiot.

With that out of the way here's my '90 C2 problem:
Mechanic replaced distributor with updated one with vent tube last
summer. Suddenly, the car would spit and sputter and hardly run
after washing or even a hard rain. On hard acceleration, or when
lugged, the car would occasionally stumble, and misfire. And, after
the distributor installation, I had a BUZZ in my radio. (Hmmm)
I took the car back to the mechanic and he couldn't find anything wrong.

I lived with the problem for a few months and today it's back in
the shop for this problem and an intermittantly dead battery.
The service manager just called - HE CAN'T DUPLICATE
EITHER PROBLEM!

(My latest problem involves a seemingly dead battery that will sometimes

come back to life a couple of hours later and crank the car.)

I"m dying here! Sounds like he cracked the distributor cap or something
during that installation. Any suggestions (other than find a new
mechanic
which I intend to do ASAP)?
