Hello all, I'm just in the process of stripping down my 2.7 engine, and
would appreciate comment on the following:
	I have seen a bit of talk regarding flywheel bolts recently but my problem
is I can't get mine out. They are so tight that when using a standard
ratchet the 12 point star bit will turn out of the bolt. Today I bought a
1/2 inch air impact drive (rated at 250 ft/lbs torque and the bolts should
be tensioned to 105 ft/lbs) & I thought getting at the bolts straight-on
rather than at 90 degrees would be the solution, but the bolts are still
too tight - the rattle gun won't budge them. Maybe locktite has been used.
I might see if I can borrow a larger 3/4 inch drive unit.
	Also I have read that the head studs should be replaced with timeserts and
dilavar studs. Is this really necessary and how do I know whether I already
have them? There seems to be a thread insert already in the crankcases - is
this standard or do I have these timeserts already? How can you tell?
	I have Nikasil barrels (11 fins) and am not sure how badly these are worn.
The pistons to me look like new and seemed to only have gummed-up oil rings
but no other visible wear. I think all the nikasil coating is still intact
in the barrels with no lip at the top at all. I have access to measuring
equipment to measure piston & barrel diameter but they are in imperial
measurements and my manual has metric. The measurements seem to be too
small for me to convert accurately. If they were in a normal car I wouldn't
hesitate to use them again but the Porsche engine is something completely
new to me. Anyone have any tips here to find if they are OK to use again?	

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
		Regards Dean.
