Just to add, if you are doing the tensioner update yourself, make
double-d*mn sure the oil lines are completely open.  When we did mine a
couple of months ago, they weren't.  The result?  Brand-new tensioners
failed within the first 15 miles, bag-o-nails sounds and all.  Had to do
the whole thing twice.  On the plus side, my mechanic was VERY helpful,
doing the whole job a second time, no cost and in less than a day for
something that wasn't at all his fault.  I sincerely hope he got his money
back on the parts.  In case anyone wants to know, his name is Steve Bloom,
Bloom's German Car Service.  Super-nice guy, very knowledgeable, up-front
and honest.  I'd highly recommend him to anyone in the Atlanta area.

Incidentally, I let him source his own parts and was very happy with the
pricing.  A good mechanic is gold.
