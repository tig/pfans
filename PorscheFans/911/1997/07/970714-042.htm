Steve Meltzer asks about pressure bleeding brakes as an alternative to
hand vacuum bleeding.  

One of the 914 era Upfixn's has an article on this, which I followed:  Get
a spare reservoir cap and gasket.  Drill a hole in this cap and insert a tire
valve stem assembly.  Pinch or otherwise close off  the overflow tube
from the reservoir.  Now, if you can add some air pressure through the
valve, you can pressure bleed your brakes.  To add some air (not too
much, doesn't need much and the reservoir is not designed for
pressure), connect your reservoir valve with your front tire (or some
other handy tire - hard to have too llittle pressure here).  Getting the parts
to connect these two tire valves may be the tough part.  The one which
screws onto the tire has to have a gizmo in it to depress the Schraeder
valve to let air out of the tire and into the hose.  Vws of '70 or so vintage
used the spare to pressurize the windshield squirters, and had such an
attachment.  Various other cars did too.  You can use a similar gizmo on
the reservoir end, or any old end which screws onto a tire valve stem
and leave out the valve at that end).

Of course, you have already jacked up and removed whichever wheels
you are going to bleed, or have a plan to do this in some order (usual
advice is farthest from master cylinder first, so for most it is RR, LR, RF,
LF, although with dual circuits I doubt the front to back order really
matters, and am dubious that the side to side matters either).  So all you
do is attach your wrench to the bleeder and put on the tube to your
catch can, and crack the bleeder until satisfied you have gotten out
whatever you want to get out.  Especially if using this system to flush
the system (where it shines), keep close watch on the fluid level in the
reservoir - you don't want to be pushing air into the system, just new
fluid to push old out.  to add more fluid, unscrew the air hose, take off
cap, add fluid, etc.

I like this better than the vacuum method.  I seem to get less brake fluid on
my hands and elsewhere, and I could never tell if the bubbles I got with
the vacuum system were just sucked around the bleeder and back out,
or were actually in the fluid.

there is the issue of fluid contamination with this system.  professional
pressure bleeder systems use a rubber bladder to pressurize a tank of
fluid, which in turn is attached to the reservoir somehow.  that way the
pressurizing air (with its attendant water) never contacts the new brake
fluid.  Of course, the air that went into your tire may have had moisture in
it (in fact, it probably did), so that is, at least in theory, a drawback.  Can't
say I have noticed a difference compared to other methods, but again I
didn't take samples to my basement laboratory and carefully measure the
percentage of absorbed moisture, or check the boiling point, or make any
other quantitative measurement of this.

I've used this simple pressure system off and on for a dozen years
when working alone.  Even with someone to help you can't overstroke
the MC, you don't get hoarse saying "pump," Carrol Smith says that
pumping with any force can create cavitation and air bubbles (he prefers
gravity bleeding, slow though that can be), and all in all it is pretty quick
and slick.  Still, the vacuum systems seem to have most of these virtues
too.  Maybe if I just had a large enough catch bottle I'd like them more.
