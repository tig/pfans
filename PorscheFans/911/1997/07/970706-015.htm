Believe it or not, the oil companies, especially the better brands,
understand lubrication.  Believe it or not, the car manufactures have
people that understand lubrication.  You will void you warrantee if you
tinker with your oil

The oil additive package is controlled, in some cases, to the parts per
million level.  Then you dump a quart of  something in it, and  you have no
idea what it is?   At best, you are wasting money.  At worst, you will harm
the engine.  By a good brand on oil, and follow the manufacture's change
interval.  If you have to spend extra, go with a good synthetic, but still
follow the prescribed change interval.  You will get the optimum life from
your engine.  As for the testimonials you hear: "believing is seeing" 
"there is a sucker born every minute"...

Enjoy your car.  Oils available now are good.  Do not mess them up.  Have
fun!


Porsche Owner seeks advice,

I have heard from a friend, and now seen on the Infomercial, about a
product
called Prolong Lubricant.

This is an oil additive. It is claimed to reduce friction, increase
horsepower and increase gas mileage. 

My friend says he uses it in his Corvette (no accounting for taste) and
swears by it. He says he gets better mileage, smoother idleing, etc.

Does anyone have any information on this product? Has anyone used it in
their
Porsche? Any dangers by using it on a 911? i don't want to be stupid with
my
Porsche, so any advice, comments, information, etc. that you may have would
be greatly appreciated.
