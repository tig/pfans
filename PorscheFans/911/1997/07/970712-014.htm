This is very common with Porsches. Your car was trying to attain 
'SCHNOTZ' through an action which is referred to as SCHNOTZING or 
GAZOOONHEIGHT. To the tuned ear the sound is more AAAAUUUCCCCTTTT... 
aaaauuuucccctttt... {take a moment and try to this] 

>I turned down the radio

Wrong!
If you would have waited for a second or two, instead of turning down 
your radio - an act that in this case is comparable to placing a finger 
under your nose to stifle a sneeze - your Porsche would have completed 
the SCHNOTZ and you would have heard a single 'choo', followed by a 
misty spray from the tailpipe. If this happens again, [DOOBLE-SCHNOTZ is 
very rare] immediately tune to an Opera - Wagner is a good choice.

>she ran fine from there on out. 

She? Gotten Himmel... FRAU-SCHOTZ!

>Dang.

I assume this is a Gomer-ism... similar to "Gollleeee Andy!"
Very unusual for someone from Memphis.

Don't you hate it when they refuse to talk plain English, or in your 
case American. It's a clogged Piffel Valve, no doubt caused by a failure 
to complete the Schnotz.
The only time I have ever heard the term "Gol-derned Motronics" was on a 
very obscure episode of Andy of Mayberry when Barney was talking to Aunt 
Bea about a gizmo he was designing to revolutionize Nuclear Fusion. They 
later changed it to a recipe for marshmallow brownies, which of course 
led to that famous episode where Aunt Bea makes the hash brownies and 
Barney and Oppie steal Ffffllloyd's Porsche Turbo, and cross state 
lines.

"I would like to assure the members of the committee and the honorable 
Senator from Tennessee that I have never met this person. And I most 
certainly do not...AAAUUUUCCCCTTTTT aaaauuucccctttttt..."

Actually it cleared my sinuses.

>Frank Ahlgren

It's your last name I can't pronounce without sneezing.
That's it... AAAHHHHLLLLLGGGGGRRRRREEEEENNNNN.
Holy Schicklegruber...I've achieved SCHNOTZ!!!!!

1989 Coupe that only goes ZZZZOOOOMMMMMM!

P.S. Great post Frank!
Apologies to all my German friends. Just a minute, I don't have any 
German friends, just a German brother in law. In that case, who cares.
