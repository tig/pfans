I recently purchased a 78 911 SC.  A few weeks after I bought the car, all
the insulation fell off the inside of the engine compartment.  I at first
thought I would be able to re-glue it in place, but it simply crumbled to
dust when handled.  I therefore have removed as much of it as I can get at.
 Any advice on a suitable replacement would be welcome.  It seems to me
that to do a decent job with the correctly shaped OE stuff would require
removing the engine first.  Does anyone have any better solutions.

Also, I have read conflicting recommendations for the mileage interval
between valve adjustments on these cars.  Can anyone state what the correct
interval is.  I am planning on doing this very shortly, so any advice on
this procedure would also be welcomed.

Thanks,

Eric
