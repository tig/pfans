Arnold,

Have you looked at Firestone's SZ50s?  They were designed by Masawa
Kawabata, who did the RE71s for the 959, and, more recently, SO2s.
They're supposedly modelled after CART/PPG's rain rubber.

SZ50s certainly seem to handle better in both dry and wet conditions
than the comparable BFG and Goodyear tires.  I was able to drive them
back to back on a wet/dry autocross course mounted on Mustangs.  Road
noise in the dry was very low, and cornering squirm wasn't bad.

Last year I was out at Road America for a day-long ride and drive event
with Scott Pruett and a few other pro drivers (David Murray, Pete
Cunningham, David Donahue, Buzz Collins).  While it did drizzle some in
the morning, it was dry most of the day.  Those guys drove the crap out
of the Corvettes the SZ50s were on (2 sets of brake pads) and at the end
of the day there was little feathering and no chunking to be found.

Good luck!
