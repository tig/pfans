"It's Evil, Dad.  Don't touch it!" - Time Bandits

This is one of the things we agreed not to talk about when Pfans
got started.  Some of us were there and some got (and get!) pretty
hacked off about it...  Here's the story - sans gory/sketchy details
and editorial...

Short version:
Money donated (around US$10K) to listmeister and list doesn't exist.

Long version:
Porschefans' predecessor was also run on a volunteer basis.  The
listmeister was a partner in several firms, a race team, and
several other ventures.  The main server for one of the firms
hosted the P-list.  While some aspects of the list were automated
via software, the listmeister still performed many duties manually
(subscribe/unsubscribe, etc).

Listmeister experiences professional and personal problems and requires
cash - street 911 and race 914 are put up for sale to meet obligations.
List members offer to take up collection to buy 914 so listmeister can
keep it.  Listmeister is moved by members' generosity, but decides to
sell cars and suggests collection be used for keeping the list running
and new hardware.

Time passes.  Money is donated without strings attached.  Listmeister
experiences further personal and professional problems.  Partnerships
dissolve, divorce is imminent, computer that hosts the list crashes.
Listmeister is no longer partner in firm that owns computer.  List is
low on firm's priority list and ceases to exist...
