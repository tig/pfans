Must sell this project car to make room for replacement 911 coming as soon as
you buy this one.  Compression test on 12/96 was 1) 175, 2) 070, 3) 185, 4)
175, 5) 175, 6) 180.  On 7/97 vehicle failed Texas hydrocarbron emissions
text--on low idle (2500 rpm) it gave off 424 ppm; maximum legal is 400 ppm.
This car needs a top-end rebuild and I'm not a mechanic.  I'm hoping to get
$10K for it that I will use as a down payment on another 911 I am looking at.
AC works great (bulkhead kit added), AM/FM is o.k., windows tinted, Carrerra
tensioners and popoff valve, new Yokos on back and front Yokos have over 60%
tread.  New front brake pads and lines flushed this month.
I've owned the car for a year and a half and have put a lot into it.  It is a
daily driver, has been garaged and can be seen in Houston.

p.s. Please forgive the re-post if you've seen this before.  I got calls on
the first post, but it never showed up in a digest, so I figure there was a
glitch...
