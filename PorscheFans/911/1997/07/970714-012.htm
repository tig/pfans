Ah well, the increased suck of the rebuilt throttle bodies has caused
the clutch-operating vacuum servo of my car's Sportomatic transmission
to pack in. So, does anyone have a '69-'73 Sporto vacuum servo lying
around? (I'm told that the servo was also used on a VW version of the
system). Apprarently the larger servo used on 3-litre cars will not
fit on an early one.

Partly because of the Sporto woes, and partly because the rest of the
car is in good shape & I'd rather keep it than trade it for a car with
manual transmission and unknown problems, I'm considering putting in
a 901 or 915 transmission.

I'd appreciate any info on sources for good used or completely rebuilt
boxes, also the other bits necessary fro the conversion (I understand
there are some firms that offer complete kits). JCM in Colorada has
been recommended as a supplier of transmissions, but I don't have an
address for them. Advice, war stories, and general blather is welcome.

Mark Honman & '69 911E Sporto, back to playing with the interior.
