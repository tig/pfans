The 75 2.7 is one of the worse years for any 911 IF it hasn't been fixed 
up.  You mentioned head bolts - make sure it has Divlar studs in all 24 
locations.  The Carrera tensioner update is also almost mandatory.  Other 
problems are the 5 blade fan.  Should be updated to the 11 blade fan for 
better cooling (about $400).  Also the catalytic converters on these years 
really overheat the engine (should be removed).  In my opinion ALL 2.7 
liter engines should have an external oil cooler to run at the proper temp. 
 If it doesn't have one think about $1k for a decent set up. Also have the 
valve guides checked out.  Did the engine overhaul include new valve 
guides/top end?  These wear out quickly in these pre 1977 2.7's.  911 
transmissions are very durable, but very notchy.  Your 944 is a dream to 
shift next to a 75 911, but it should not be grinding gears.  Make sure the 
syncro's are not shot.  Very rare for 4th and 5th gear syncros to be worn 
out, usually 1st and 2nd gears are the ones to go.  You don't mention 
price.  This car shouldn't be over $9k or so by the sounds of it (assuming 
a complete engine rebuild).  It is a great car if it has the above 
modifications.

Good luck,

Scott

73 911t (2.7 with all the above mod's)

From: zmf@uwyo.edu (Z. Fuzessery), on 7/1/97 3:14 PM:
Hello air-cooled folks.  I belong to the 924-944 list (yeah, I know), but
would like some advice/opinions on purchasing a 1975 911S Targa.  I know
just enough about 911s to be dangerous.  This topic is probably old hat on
this server, but would appreciate comments.

I love my 944 S2, but 911s do have a certain charisma and this '75 seems to
be in pretty good shape. 

-- 130K miles, rebuild engine w/ 20K miles, upgraded head bolts and timing
chain to offset some of the bad features of the 2.7 liter engine. 
-- Rebuilt clutch that feels good even to a 944 driver. No razor-sharp
release point common to many older 911s.  --Rust spots beneath headlights
and on one lower rear corner of the door jam (a hole all the way thru). 
-- Compared to my 944, the car felt high and relatively unstable at 80-90
mph, but I'm not sure what they're supposed to feel like.  
-- Felt good downshifting and accelerating thru sweepers, but ground the
gears a bit from 5 to 4 and 4 to 3 if shifting was too quick, or w/out
double-clutching. Brake and throttle pedals are at very different levels -
heel/toe would be difficult w/out a major addition to height of throttle
pedal.
-- Targa was wind noise, but would assume that needs to be rebuild.
-- I trust the Porsche shop that's selling it, and who's looked after it
several years.

The car would be for fun driving and for the track -- maybe Vintage racing.
 Does the Targa body flex that much more than a coupe? What's the cost like
for lowering the body a bit and upgrading the suspension? Is it inevitable
that I will want to drop a larger engine in it (felt pretty quick for only
175 hp)?  Is the oversteer pretty extreme on these older models w/out the
larger rear wheels?  I expect it would take me a while to get comfortable
in the corners, but then that's part of the charm.  I like having my 944
take care of me when I do something stupid, but think it would be
interesting to track something that bites back a little more.

TIA. Please reply to me (zmf@uwyo.edu) since I don't get the 911 posts. And
please don't mention to the 924-944 list that I dropped by.
