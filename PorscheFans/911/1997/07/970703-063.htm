Colin,

(2)  YES!!  My 993 wore out the rear tires (Yoko A008) is less than 10,000
miles, while fronts were still less than half worn.  Replaced rears
withGoodrich 
Comp T/A ZRs, car quickly started feeling like an early 60's 911 with two
flat rear tires; car wanted to oversteer at slightest provocation. After
about
2000 careful miles, tires had bedded in nicely; grip was equal to original
Yokos as near as I could tell.
  
(3) Have gone about 9000 miles on them and they are slightly over 1/2 worn.
The Yokos on the front are worn out at 21,000 miles but this was partly an
alignment problem.

(reply to);

I know this has got to be one of the most-repeated subjects around,
but...
(snip)

2.  Am I asking for trouble if I get new (non-Goodyear) rears and keep
the Goodyear fronts for a few thousand miles?  Should I bite the
bullet and replace all four at a time?

3. What kind of wear can I expect out of the tires?

Any thoughts appreciated,
