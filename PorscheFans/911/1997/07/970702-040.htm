Dear Digesters,	

I've owend a 85 911 Carrera Sunroof Coupe (Red over black, 59K miles,
A/C, factory alarm, Momo wheel, Sony 10 disc CD) for a little over a
year.  The car is mostly stock, except for an X front strut brace and
Koni adjustables.  The car was lowered by the previous owner.  Were 16"
wheels and tires stock?  My wheels are alloy with black cookie cutter
spokes.  I have Comp TA 205/55 f and 225/55 r.  Is this a good setup? 
When it's time to replace tires and/or wheels, what are the best street
and track options? Can someone explain the "famous 915 gearbox" feel and
the 18 wheeler without hydraulics clutch feel?  Are chips avaialble for
this car?  What, approximately, was the MSRP for this car when new?  How
careful do I have to be so the "arrow" doesn't turn around and go
forward?  IMHO, without a rear wing, this is the best looking car on the
road, anywhere in the world, period.  The brakes are great.  The
handling good.  The A/C, well, it's German.  I've been told that I
"basically have a hand built car".  Thus the premium price.  I know I'm
missing something. Why do I feel itchy about this car?  Perhaps, herein
lies the rub: my affections (and experience) are elsewhere.  My 911
shares space in the garage with another German marque.  With another one
parked in the driveway.  I have a 68 1600 (upgraded, modified, and,
gulp, nearly rust free) and a 95 E36 M3 (JC chip, B&B tri flow, K&N). 
My ultimate goal is to be able to drive all of these street cars well on
a track.  Any help getting there is greatly appreciated.  Particularly
interested in hearing from Porsche fans who appreciate the other marque.
Those who flame either marque, IMHO, are uninformed.  

Chris Brennan
