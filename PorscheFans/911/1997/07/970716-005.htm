MLB,

I believe that your car has a shortened shifter (10%) over the earlier
cars.  The "short shift" kits will shorten travel on old models by 20%.  So
you will gain little.  Your problems going into first are common, "they all
do that".  It is caused by worn out synchronizers in the transmission.
Technique can help a lot.  Specifically, shift into first just before the
car comes to a complete stop (1 MPH).  Then you can go back into neutral
until you're ready to start, works for me.  When it get really bad, you may
have to have the transmission rebuilt.

You may try changing the gear lube.  It helped mine a little.  You may also
try adjusting the shift mechanism.  Finally, you may try replacing the
bushings under the shift lever to remove some of the slop.

911s do not have fast-shifting transmissions, slow down and let it do its
thing.  I think you will gain little from a short shift kit, and it may
exacerbate your problems.
