I agree with this philosophy 100%.  Many people are afraid to work on
their Pcar out of fear of screwing something up.  Believe it or not, the
mechanic that you pay to work on the car, in many cases, is just as
likely to screw something up as you are.  We got into this discussion
3 or 4 years ago on the old porschephiles list and I was basically
called a fool (not the first time) for working on my own car.  There was
more than a few people that felt that these cars *require* special
skills and that these skills were only found at a mechanic's shop.

I feel that, with the phenomenal wisdom of this list (thanks to
everyone who has helped me over the years!!!) and the courage
to jump in with both feet, anything is possible.  Heck, my 911 is
as easy to work on as any other car I've had - even better in
most cases since the quality of the parts is so much better.

Joe brings up a good point - few mechanics are going to be as
careful and meticulous on your car as you are.  I am in no way
implying that mechanics are careless, out -of-control wild
men under your car - I think it is just human nature to take
more time and care when it's your own vehicle.

For better or for worse, too, the amount of money you save
in labor costs allows you the freedom to screw up every
once in awhile  (that's a weird way to look at it, huh?).

Sorry for the rambling...the coffee's kicking in....  :>)

Have a good day,
