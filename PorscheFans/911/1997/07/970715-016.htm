Jeff,

A couple of thoughts.  First, pursue the thermostat operation.  When the
car is fully warmed, place your hand on the fender mounted radiator.  It
should be hot enough to make you pull your had away in a couple of seconds.
 If not, you're not getting flow through it.  The first check should be to
see if the line out of the thermostat is hot at that point.  If it's not,
I'd bet on the thermostat.  If the output is hot, I'd check the hard lines
running under the rocker panel; I'd bet one of them has been crushed.

The last resort would be to search for the gremlin.  One person on the list
reported fixing their overheating only during a rebuild.  After pulling the
fan housings (?) they found paper towels that had been lost during
maintenance.  It seems that the towels blocked the cooling fins leading to
the overheating.

Good luck,
