Brad,

Two things. One we aren't ever supposed to "stab" the brakes as I'm 
sure you know. I like the Pagid pads for track except for the price 
<sigh>. 

If a wheel locks up first, is it possible that the left front is more 
lightly loaded?  If the surface is crowned and off camber at that 
point the left front will lock first.  Corner balance also affects 
this but to a lesser degree unless your suspension is really messed 
up. I've seen a wheel lock up due to tire pressure being higher in a 
tire which on a particular circuit was more heavily loaded (heated up 
more) than the other side.

I doubt that the pads are responsible but I'd look at pad thickness 
and the calipers. If one wheel has less pad to rotor clearance 
(unless they are floating) you might see premature lock up.

Bob
