Bob,

I just replaced all 4 boots on my 1980 911SC yesterday, and I think that your Carrera has the
same configuration but with larger diameter axles and larger fasteners at the flanges.

You CAN replace just the one boot, however you will have to remove that half-axle entirely to
replace the outer boot and you might as well replace and re-pack the inner one at the same
time.  Cost of the boots is not prohibitive - I paid $20 each.  As for replacing all 4, I figured that I
was covered with grease anyhow, might as well do them all at the same time.   Someone else
may have a better argument for doing them all at the same time.  I'm glad that I did as the
previous jobber had not replaced one of the snap rings properly and it was flopping around -
luckily not damaging the CV joint!

If you decide to do it yourself, please feel free to contact me for more specifics.

Best regards,
