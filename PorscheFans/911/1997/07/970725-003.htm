I'm not directing this specifically at any one person. No offense is
intended. The list has some problems. We all know this. No list member has
lost his job, been injured, lost money, or met their end as a result of
these problems. It is a little annoying to resubscribe every now and then.
400+ of the G.P.R. messages were a little obnoxious. But, it only takes a
few minutes to resubscribe, and that delete key works pretty well. There
have been too many of us getting out of hand over these problems. Relax,
count to ten, and realize there are more important things in life to worry
about. I would hate to see how some of you deal with real problems. 

The list is a valuable way for us to network. The technical advice I have
received from other list members has saved me more than I can remember.
Buying parts from other members also has saved me a great deal of cash. If
the list is of no help to you, I certainly can understand why you might
leave. But, anyone bailing out as a result of these recent problems should
reconsider. Personally, I have no technical knowledge to help solve these
problems. However, I have been pleased to see there have been many offering
their services. The list is free to all of us. You can not expect things to
be perfect all the time.

I do agree some of us have been acting like Neanderthals. Is it so hard to
be civil?

Just my opinion,

Terry Merrell
