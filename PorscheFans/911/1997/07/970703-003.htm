If you are getting it when you lift off the throttle, then
it isn't true backfiring. When you lift, you actually suck
air into the exhaust this allows any excess fuel in the exhaust
gases (which are there when you lift) to burn, and it gives you 
that nifty popping on decelleration that some folks dig. Free 
flowing systems will do this as well as systems with a leak. 
So, if the popping is excessive, then check the gaskets, otherwise
that is what you have. It ain't going to hurt the motor.
