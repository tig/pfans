Mike Dayton reports  his '76 cuts out when initiating a left turn when
ambient temp is high on the street, but not on the track, but not for long. 
He's thought and checked through the usual suspects, and I'd be
perplexed also if it were my problem.  What would be affected by heat
and directional inertia to interrupt the spark getting to the distributor or
pressurized fuel getting to the induction system?  But when the most
obvious precipitator is present (Gs from left turn), only for a while,
clearing up even as that factor continues.  However, I offer the following
suggestions, in no particular order:

When my gas is low on the track, long hard right turns can cause the
engine to stumble (I suppose eventually left turns might have same
effect, but it shows up on rights first).  But Mike says gas level doesn't
matter.  I have been told that 20 year old gas tanks can accumulate
significant crud, which can be affected by inertia, though I've not
cleaned mine.  Can't recall if there is an in-tank filter, but draining tank,
removing it, removing inspection plug on bottom plus whatever else can
be removed, cleaning, etc, might not be a dead loss even if it didn't cure
problem.  Hard to say how heat would correlate, though.

I had a crack in the boot joining the air flow plate with the throttle body. 
Caused bad running problems which got progressively worse on a trip
until I figured it out and made quick fix with duct tape and later
replacement.  Hard to think of much else on that end of the system heavy
enough to affect "vacuum" so as to cause these symptoms.

If power to fuel pump is interrupted, engine immediately stops (SCs rev
limiter does this).  Could heat make pump relay (or fuse) looser in socket,
inertia cause momentary loss of contact?  Cleaning all affected contacts,
replacing the relay, even spreading the relay pins a bit, plus cleaning
fuse contacts and replacing fuse would at least be cheap, and might
leave you no worse off than having a just fine spare relay.

Fuel pumps can go bad, and maybe this one, if 20 years old, is in need of
retirement.  Again, though, intermittency isn't what one hears of there. 
The system up through the fuel pump is all that has much in common with
your friend's Carrera 3.2, though I wouldn't give much weight to his
problems (which he hasn't solved) being much of a help in solving yours,
given the vast differences between CIS and Motronic.  Fuel pump
vibration mounts broken (mine were) so pump can move, kinking the feed
hose when turning left? (no such thing happened to me - pump fairly well
kept in place by its lines, plus why wouldn't this happen in spades when
really pulling Gs -- well, significant fractions of one G -- on a track or
autocross?  You do autocross in hot weather also, don't you?)

When I bought my car in '84 the oil pressure idiot light would come on at
odd moments for irregular amounts of time.  Scared the bejesus out of
me at first (on VW bus I had been in the habit of only adding oil when the
idiot light would flicker when cornering hard, a habit I vowed not to
follow with the Porsche even though I had gotten away with it on the
VW with its wet sump), but the oil pressure gauge readings were
always fine - not a hiccough.  I developed various theories based on
conditions under which this would happen and how, say by letting off on
the gas, i could make it go away, though none proved accurate in the
end.  Eventually I was able to get to the sender (not easy, as many of
you know), which was reputed to be prone to leaks and other ailments. 
Sender in fact was fine, but a crimp splice someone had made in the
sender line was not fine, and was able to short out intermittently as the
wire flopped around a bit.  Of course, the sender is intended to "short
out," closing circuit for idiot light.  Can't think of anything much in the
ignition/fuel pump electrical system which is intended to sometimes go to
ground out (not blow fuses, etc, while doing so) and sometimes not,
other than perhaps the wire from the points to the CD.  I could see a
spade lug connector corroding and being affected by heat (this doesn't
seem to happen much, though - those things seem to work fine even
when pretty groddy), especially if the female part had opened up some,
but that doesn't seem really to fit this picture.  But checking all of the
various connectors and multi-pin plugs in the ignition and fuel pump
branches of the wiring tree, including grounds, might be in order.  You
haven't said if anything else which only works when the ignition switch
is in the on position quits when the car stutters (the radio?).  Did a
previous owner fiddle with any of these wires for some purpose?

Heavy keys on key chain causing differential inertial torque on ignition
switch when turning?  Pretty far fetched, as key is in the lock part of
switch, which in turn is linked to the separate electrical part at the back
end of the switch.  The starter switch portion of ignition switch on 
wife's '84 once packed up, but that was an all or nothing deal.

I once pulled apart a dead CD box to see if I could figure out what part
had died and just unsolder and replace.  My electronic skills were not up
to that task, but everything in the box was pretty solid.  These things
tend either to work fine or suddenly not to work at all, so I would place it
low on my list despite the fact that it is by far the most sophisticated


piece of electronics that could cause the engine to stutter in a '76.  Cold
solder joints and the like are what heat most affects, no?  Not inertial
effects in a narrow range:  low Gs, and to the left.

How about:  you connected your left turn signal inadvertently into the
ignition?  No, that doesn't explain the heat effect.  Has car always done
this?  Or did you notice it after you had fixed something else?  

Yup, sure is a puzzle.  Hope one of these musings gives more than moral
support.
