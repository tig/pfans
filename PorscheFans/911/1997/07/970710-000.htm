I have a 1977 911 2.7 litre and a couple of days ago when I put the hand
brake on it
went slack (I thought a cable had snapped), anyway I had to drive about 30
miles to get
home and in the last 10 miles there were some expensive sounding noises
coming
from one of the rear wheels (I stopped but could not see anything at the
time as it was dark & raining)

I later stripped down the rear wheel brakes etc and found that the metal
tube where the hand brake cable goes
into the brake drum housing had been rubbing against the drive shaft. I put
the brakes back together and now
the handbrake seems ok. Is there a way of preventing this happening again ?
Are it the cable tensioner nuts coming unscrewed by
themselves ?. The guy that owned the car before me said that this had
happened once before a couple of years ago.

Regards 


Bill
