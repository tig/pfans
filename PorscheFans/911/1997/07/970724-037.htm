I have a  stock 1980 911 SC Targa with the stock radio.  I am planning on
upgrading to a CD player and possibly an outboard amp.  I have a 300 Watt amp
that I had in a different car.  I am debating whether or not I should put this
amp in the 911.  my concern is that it will draw too much current (35-50 amps)
and stress the electrical system.  I am not interested in having a "thumping"
sound system, just good clean sound.  Since I already have the amp, I am
somewhat inclined to use it.  
I would like to hear from others that have put relatively high power amps, or
other high (30+amps) current drawing devices in their 911s, and what
repercutions were suffered, if any.  I am not planning on using subwoofers in
the 911 since I need the space for kids, and I believe the bass I can get from
a 6.5" speaker in the door will satisfy my needs.  I am trying to avoid a
snowball effect problem.
