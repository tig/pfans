The actions of the past week or so, have caused me to seriously 
reconsider whether it is worth the energy to regularly re-subscribe to 
P-fans and I have decided to move on. Life is too short to have to wade 
through the vitriolic spewing of, what appears to be, a group of Porsche 
driving Neanderthals that have invaded this group - So much for the 
theory 'you are what you drive'. 
Personally, my reasons for joining the group were not only Porsche info 
related, but the hope that I would connect with a few people who shared 
my quirky sense of humor... engage in a bit of verbal jousting from time 
to time and have a few laughs. I have met some very cool Pfans and it's 
been a blast. Unfortunately, there are too many swine among the pearls.

The only direct comment I will make concerning the 'sleeziness' of the 
past few days is... I have enjoyed Frank's postings. They have been 
articulate and humorous, and all I can say is... it must have taken a 
real scuzzball to push him into the type of retaliation he felt 
necessary.

Kudo's to Ross Parker and others for trying to sort this out. Good luck.

Adios.
