I make no apologies for bringing up the recent display of rudeness on this
newsgroup once again. 
It was shocking to me that such hurtful verbal attacks of list-participants
are tolerated by the listmaster. 
This has nothing to do with a healthy exchange of opinions by Porsche owners
and drivers, or censure of free speech, but everything to do with anonymous,
uncivilized behavior without consequences to the perpetrators.
There need to be real consequences for uncivil cyberspace behavior, as there
are in real life.
I therefore ask the listmaster from now on to actively intervene and throw
off the list any participant who abuses the forum for personal attacks. 

It would be sad if this episode just "fades away" for now, because everyone
is sick of it, until someone again is irritated about something and flames
anew, damn the consequences.
I see no reason for having to wade through this poison just to get to the
brilliant ideas of well meaning Porschefans.
