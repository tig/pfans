I just changed my 73 911T with CIS over to the ignitor a few months ago.  I
had to remove the distributor to get to the screw that holds the bracket for
the wire lead inside the distributor. So yes, you may have to set timing.  I
marked my spot where I removed it to put it back in the right place.  Even
with these precautions it went in one spline off and would not start.  After
rotating distributor to get car to run I once again removed it then rotated
distributor our of engine back to original position. Replaced it, put it on
the marks and it fired right up.  I took it to my technician for final
adjustment, (no timing light) and he said the timing was right where it
should be. Did it by ear & rpm (ie: guessed). Be sure to follow the
directions closely. i bought mine from German Parts and Restoration for the
price but they were EXTREMELY helpful when I had a question about
installation and the exra wire that you must hook up to make it work. I have
better starts and the car runs great.
Hope this helps, if I can give anymore advice or help please let me know.
