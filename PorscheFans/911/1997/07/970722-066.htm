Speaking of "dumb", what in the hell are you talking about, you moron? 
Jesus, isn't it enough that you're rude as hell?  Why are you perpetuating
this image of sheer idiocy by saying things like this?  What a goddamned
dolt.

MY post didn't start this -- another did.  Further, mine was by no means
the only reply that got caught in the loop through the mail-server.  So,
BIGBADBRAIN, before you continue shooting from the hip like the cowperson
that we all know you are, why don't you check your premises?  

Don't feel too bad, smart person, there are about 30 other members of the
list that range from just about as ignorant and rude as you, to just plain
old primordial-soup-like stupid . . .

If you want to bitch, do so where it means something.  And for the love of
all you hold dear and sacred, please don't promote this complete idiocy any
longer -- it's getting old as hell . . .

I unsubscribed, so if you need confirmation of my innocence, feel free to
post this on the list, bonehead -- there are plenty of folks there who know
the truth and can ENLIGHTEN you.  Maybe they can teach you some MANNERS,
also.  Meanwhile, take an aspirin and have a cold drink.  You deserve it --
you've had a rough day and a thorough spanking . . .
