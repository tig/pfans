A couple of pholks have asked about wheel/tire sizes on my '87 Targa.
This is what was ordered:

Wheels: ROH ZS 17x7.5 5-130
Tires:  Nitto NT 501 - 215/45ZR-17 and 235/45ZR-17 (rear)

The invoice states the above wheel size twice with only a description
difference between front and rear, however, I think the invoice may be
inaccurate. I'm reasonably sure that the rear wheels are 8.5 inches wide
vs. 7.5 since they fit very nice with the wider rear tires, (i.e. no
strange symmetry with tire sidewall bulging outward from the wheel).

Harvey wrote that he had a terrible experience with Discount Tire Direct.
I'm sorry to hear that since I have suggested contacting DTD in previous
posts. Maybe I just got lucky. I don't know of any wheel sources here in
Charlotte NC that have the selection I found by scouring the ads in
Excellence, etc.. Plus, I don't have the funds to buy from RUF or one of
the other more expensive sources, so, I must turn to sources like DTD and
the Tire Rack. My Audi has a set of BBS wheels that I bought from the
Tire Rack years ago, and my experience with them was also good. Oh well,
I guess it's a crap shoot.
