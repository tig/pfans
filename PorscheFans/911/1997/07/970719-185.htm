I was curious about this fix too.  The early SC's had problems with the =
oil screen itself.  The style of oil screen they had caused problems =
with high RPM oil scavenging, and would cause oil temp to rocket up, oil =
pressure to drop, and the car felt like it lost power.  I have updated =
mine, although I never had the scavenging problem happen to me.

The thing is, all SC's beginning with 1980 cars should have had the =
updated oil screen from the factory.

As someone else mentioned, having the sump cover on so the oil drain =
plug interferes with the oil pickup could also cause this problem.  =
Maybe the mechanic figured getting the drain plug out of there =
altogether would improve things.  My guess is that changing the oil =
screen cover would have had no effect, unless the original was not on =
right.
