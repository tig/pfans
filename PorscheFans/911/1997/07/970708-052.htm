The driver of the 911 Turbo was an experienced BMW school driver in the
advanced group.  He had an E36 M3 left at home with warped rotors that
was
used in many prior schools, without incident.  The driver was having
some
difficulty adapting to the 911 Turbo and the incredible performance on
tap.
 The accident was truly unfortunate.  And a reminder that Laguna Seca
can
build your confidence and then deliver a very unpleasant surprise with
its
concrete walls.

The idea of limiting performance at Drivers' Schools with chips, speed
limits or banning R1's is an incredibly bad idea.  The performance of
the
cars, BMW and others, continues to climb with the development of
technology.  The Schools need to continue to adapt to this performance
increase as they have done in the past.

Safety Yes, performance limiters No.  If cars get bent at a school it is

regrettable but acceptable when proper safety equipment prevents injury.
