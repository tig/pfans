I have a 72 911S with MFI that runs very well except in two conditions. 
 When the throttle is barely open it seems to mis-fire and just run poorly. 
 If I have my foot in the gas it will rev right to red line without missing 
a beat.  Unfortunately, in every day driving you can't run around with your 
foot to the floor.  Does anyone have an idea what causes this type of 
behavior?

Secondly, when backing off the throttle at high RPM it pops out the 
exhaust.  Granted, it can be amusing to scare the people in their accords 
with a gunshot from a 911, but in general it is not something I like to 
have occuring.

I have been told that the popping out the exhaust during overrun can be 
caused by un-synchronised throttle bodies.  Haynes says that it could be 
due to a broken RPM sensor or microswitch.

Thanks,
