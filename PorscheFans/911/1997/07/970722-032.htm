I don't know if this is a functioning list anymore, but I'll try again:

I love my "new" '96 C2, but it's just too quiet! The available cat-back
systems seem to be B&B Tri-flo, Borla, and the one advertised in Pano by
Fabiani. Any others?
Has anyone compared these, as to fit, quality and price? Any recommendations?

This is a street car, w/ an occasional driver's ed and auto-x.
Also, would the K&N filter add a bit of sound and performance?

I posted this just before the big crash and got 1 suggestion: the factory
sport (sound)
package, consisting of 2 mufflers and a sport air cleaner. Anyone have
experience with these? I also learned from the dealer that the replacement
mufflers must have a place for the downstream oxy sensors, and that
apparently some of them don't.

Thanks-------Dave
