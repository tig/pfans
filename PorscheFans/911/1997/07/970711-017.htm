Howdy again,
         On July 5 I wrote in about my upcoming dynotest. My totally restored
and custom built 74 911S was chassis dyno tested at 228.7 HP@ 7200 RPM with
187.3 lbs torque. With the Porschefans recommended multiplier of .82 as a
deduct for the moving components in the drivetrain this calculates to 278 HP
for the engine. Also the engine has been detuned (smaller jets and retarded
timing) for streetability as opposed to track events so I figure the engine
would be close to the 285 HP originally estimated. I was very proud that my
smaller engine tested higher than a Dynojet employees 81 911SC. He only had
150HP. If any of you are interested here are the specs on my itty-bitty 2.7.

If anybody is interested she's for sale. The engine and entire vehicle have
only 4000 miles since the complete restoration. Most of the parts listed
above are new. Some of the items are updates from newer Porsches. Everything
is cleaned, polished, and near concours condition. I'll state without
reservation that this is the nicest, fastest, 2.7 street legal 74 911S
anywhere. She would be perfect as a club racer or a Class 4 concours entry.
