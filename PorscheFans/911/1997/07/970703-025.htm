 Porschephiles,

I have taken the list's adivse about my non-working speedo issue and bought
a speedo sensor for
my 87 911.  It was put in yesterday by my Porsche wrench, and lo and behold
, the damn
speedo still don't work!

Very disappointed, and a little mad for seemingly spending $ 100 for
nothing, I drove home, since
the wrench was at a loss and told me to come back Monday, so he can put an
oscilloscope on it.
After driving about 15 miles, the speedo suddenly started to work as if
nothing ever happened.
This morning, however, the speedo was dead again. Incidentially, this is how
my problem started;
sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. Looks like I am back to square
one.

Do any of you have any other tips as to what else could be causing this
intermittant problem?

Thanks,

Darrel
