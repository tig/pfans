Nick,

There were two major improvements that occurred soon after '75.  First, in
'76 the entire body was galvanized to prevent rust.  Prior to that time,
various parts were galvanized, but any car that lived outside of CA or AZ
should be checked carefully for rust.

Second, in '78 the "SC" was introduced with a new 3.0 l engine that fixed
many of the problems encountered with the 2.7 l.  Some people have had
great reliability with the 2.7 l, but most people with the 3.0 l have had
great service.  In '78 you also got a better suspension with the wider rear
track that reduced the tail swapping tendency of the earlier models.  The
downside is higher weight.

As for the transmission.  The 911 has the most idiosyncratic transmission
that I've driven.  You'll hear a lot of people say "they all do that",
meaning that all of the transmissions are hard to shift.  This is
especially true when engaging 1st & 2nd.  However, 4th & 5th are usually
okay, so I would have that checked by a knowledgable 911 mechanic; could be
the clutch or a shifter mechanism adjustment.

I'll also impart a reality check about the dealer selling it.  Don't listen
to them about the condition of the car unless they are providing a
guarantee.  There goal is to sell the vehicle for the most money as quickly
as possible.  This contrasts with your goal of getting a good, reliable,
well maintained car.  If the car is good, you'll know after checking it
thoroughly.  Also, don't jump at the first car.  It sounds like this is the
first 911 you've driven.  I'd drive as many as you can find before making
the purchase.
