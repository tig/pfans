Hi,

Turns out I'm having some trouble with the air flow meter in my '87 carrera
(some slight stu-stu-stuttering @ 2500 rpm). Well it's not that annoying
(yet) that I'm willing to spend $400 on a new one, but in the everlasting
process of gathering P-info (I'm no wrench, I didn't even know what an air
flow meter was or did) I came across a device that replaces the air flow
meter. It was mentioned in the latest issue of 911 & Porsche World. This
device uses a 'hot film' or 'hot wire' and nolonger has a moving airflap
(this mechanical part is the one that causes the thing to fail). There's an
English firm that provides it (FilmStar) and I saw something likewise in
the Performance Products catalog. I believe there's also one from
Autothority. These little dingies come with a new ECU and are supposed to
deliver 20 extra hp's. They're pretty expensive ($ 2,000 compaired to $ 400
for a regular air flow meter) but the extra hp's are kinda attractive (will
we ever get enough?). Does anybody on the list have any experience with
these things, are the worth the extra bucks and do they deliver the hp's as
promised?
Well, I'm looking forward to any comments…
TIA
