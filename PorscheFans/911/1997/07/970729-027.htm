Patience. It takes time to find someone you can trust. The 911 is no picnic
to work on and the parts pricing eats into the profit of the wrench. You
may want to try working on it yourself. No, it isn't brain surgery (well,
unless you have been in and out of the DME) but it isn't tinkertoys either.

I don't feel that anyone ever gives up a 911, it gives you up and moves on
to someone who understands it.
