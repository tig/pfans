.....Recently I have come across an 1983 Euro-930 that was converted to a
full DP 935 (Slant nose-twin turbo) in1989.  I have at this point little
knowledge of DP conversions and am curious as to the build quility of the
project (especially the engine)...
.....Is anyone out there familiar with DP conversions?  If so, could you
give
some advice with regard to my concerns stated above.  I would be most
appreciative.
========================================
Bill,
DP is a pretty known P-tuner, like RUF or Gemballa and they can build quite
a mean machine 8^) They usually build the car to the customers wishes, not
much of a standart package (it's more like how much you can/want to
spend...), though the slant-nose conversions are kind of their trademark
(or used to be).

Do keep in mind that those fiberglass bodyparts aren't as trouble free as
everyone might think they are. Ok, they don't rust, save weight to the car
and in case of a hit are (relativly) easy to repair, but it's not metal!
The reason #1 for fiberglass parts is the cheap & easy way to fabricate
them. 
What I mean to say is that fiberglass bodyparts are very sensitive to
torque (especially the parts that are 'glued' on to the car) and
temperature changes, which in the long run will show through the paint or
even chip the paint of 8^( 
So it really matters how these parts were made (how many layers of
fiberglass etc.). Equally importand is how/by who they were put on the car
(this doesn't matter much for the bolt on parts, but does for the glued on
parts), 'cause these kits are also sold as 'do-it-yourself-sets'.
On the other hand, DP is said to be an expert on fiberglass for many years,
which should count for something... Just take a close look at the car and
look for the places where the fiberglass parts meet the orignal metal. You
might not see it right away, but at the right angle a bad seem will show!
Also make sure the car is really 'hit-free', 'cause many of these body
conversions are 
performed on wrecked cars, so get it inspected!

If I remember correctly, there was an article on DP in the march or april
issue of 911&world, which I believe even included a phone number of the
guys at DP (maybe you can get some info on your car from them). I could
look it up for you, just let me know...

To end my $ 0.02, I hope I didn't scare you off too much (certainly didn't
mean to) but I've seen just one to many poor body-conversions than I would
care for...

Let me know how it turns out
Good luck!
