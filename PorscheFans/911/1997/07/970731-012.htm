I'm a bit confused JUST what you are asking for.....except that for some
reason that you may not wish to be responsible for your own actions.  I
know that on rare occasions there is a problem with the police, but that
is really far and few between.  I think that many of us so called
"adults" feel that we are always in the right.  That may be convienent at
times but always distructive.  If you were in fact speeding, then admit
it and negociate the penalty.  If you were not speeding then let the
state prove it's case.  In my opinion it is better to take a lawyer if
you are not guilty of speeding.  If you are, then I would think that a
lawyer probably would be a waste of time  I am not a lawyer, just a
retired cop.
