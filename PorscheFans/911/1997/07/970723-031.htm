Well, I was in the same dilemma about 6 months ago. The 944 is cheap
and available, and I really love the 911.

I solved my dilemma by *driving* both - I've been looking for the
right 911 ever since. I get a little tempted when I see a nice 944 drive
by (I do like the look of the 944 as well), but never tempted enough to
change my mind. The cars drive completely differently and unless you
check both out, I suspect you'll never know.

I'm also looking for a daily driver. Properly maintained, both the 944
and 911 can be very reliable cars. Don't take your car to a generic
'european' car fixit shop - find a reputable mechanic and/or learn to do
some of the work yourself - it ain't rocket science but there's some tricks
that people unfamiliar with Pcars will miss.

What you can afford, of course, makes a difference. Don't buy a clapped out
beater just because it has the 'P' word on the back. Learn the pitfalls
of the cars in your price range - check out Wade Guthrie's 911 FAQ at:

http://users.deltanet.com/users/guthrie/911.htm

Another good reference for you is Bruce Anderson's "Porsche 911 Performance
Handbook".

And whatever you do, spend the $$$ to have ANY car you're considering
thoroughly checked out at a reputable shop...

Cheers!

Ross
