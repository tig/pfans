Steve Poole asks if he can fix his odometer reset himself, or should he
go to an odometer shop.  I've got a spare odo on which the reset doesn't
work at all, while Steve's sounds like it is just getting there.  Years ago
Ron Appleton of Appleton Autowerks, 303-444-9117 in Boulder,
Colorado, told me this was usually caused by a press fit gear (or
something like that) getting loose, and that he had figured out a way of
fixing it (along with a way of removing and reinstalling the bezel so you
could get at the innards without making it look like it was fixed with a
crowbar, as mine did).  From this I conclude that, unless you think you
can disassemble some clockwork gearing, knurl a very small shaft, and
press back on a small gear or something similar, the odo shop might be a
good bet.  Reset problems are not uncommon, so the main shops should
be familiar with it.  Or see what Ron would charge (he's got an
independent Porsche service business), which is what I would do with
mine if I ever decide I need it.  I went into one of these speedometers and
found and fixed a blown diode which had caused the whole shebang
not to work, but the mechanical part looked, as I recall, not set up for
easy disassembly, although perhaps my memory fails me and VDO had
ease of service in mind.

Walt Fricke (whose PO's gray market Federalizers did not realize a
separate ground wire was needed to go from the isolated electronics to
the case and its ground wire - VDO must have thought someone would
want to run their unit in a positive ground car?)
