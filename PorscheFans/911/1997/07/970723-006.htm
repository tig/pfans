Brad,

You got it in the second part. Corner balance is "modifying static weight
distribution through subtle changes in ride height". The weight of a
driver, at 180 lbs or so, does make a big difference. You adjust the corner
balance by moving the torsion bar positions in the suspension. Since this
will affect the final resting height of the suspension arm relative to the
body the alignment also changes. Therefore the alignment must be done after
the ride height or your alignment will change. Once the ride height is set
and any adjustments are made, you body weight will not have much effect on
the alignment. 

In a way a see your point, and in fact if you only adjusted you ride height
by a small amount the alignment would not change much either. I guess the
biggest reason is that to adjust the rear ride height usually means
disassembling the rear suspension altogether therefore totally screwing up
any previous adjustments.

Hope this clarifies it a bit
