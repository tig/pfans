Ah, "cheap and nasty black mirrors" are the clue here.  Some PO =
installed them, not realizing that the mirror on the passenger side does =
not mount at the same location as the drivers side.  This is one of =
those neat little 911 quirks (like the wipers parking on the drivers =
side) that I really like, and most people don't even notice.

The factory manuals have a section on installing a passenger-side mirror =
on cars without.  They include a template that shows exactly where to =
drill the holes.  Unfortunately, this is for the later paddle-style =
electric mirrors, and I can't find any similar instructions for the =
early cars.  The driver's side mirror is mounted further forward than on =
the passenger's side.

As far as what the car should have, the following is a quote from "The =
911 and 912 Porsche, A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity", by Dr. B. =
Johnson:

"The optional outside rear view mirror was mounted to the drivers door.  =
The standard mirror used from 1965 through 1967 was the same Durant =
mirror used on the 356C.  From 1968 to 1971,a slightly larger Durant =
mirror, also round, was fitted.  The base was identical, and the seal =
between the mirror and the body was the same as the earlier version.  In =
1971, it could be fitted with a convex mirror."

"A Talbot mirror was offered from 1965 through 1968.  Both right and =
left mirrors are listed in the accessories catalogs, along with text =
stating that they were not installed at the factory, but for $13.40 =
(1965 price) they were a bargain.  In 1968 the left side Talbot mirror =
is noted as being illegal in the U.S. and Germany, due to its small =
glass size."

The photos included of all these mirrors shows them to be chrome, and =
they are all round.  Rectangular chrome mirrors were offered beginning =
in 1972, based on the above reference.

Hope this helps!
