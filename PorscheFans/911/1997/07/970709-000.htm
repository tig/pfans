Warning : my experience comes from a CIS system
in a Mercedes 500, 1981.

Testing warm up regulator is done by attaching
pressure gauge when engine is cold. Start engine
and notice the pressure rise.
The exact pressurevalues depend on enginetype
and ambient temperature.
On my car (Mercedes) and ambient temperature about
20C, the initial pressure is between 1 and 1.4 Bar.

After a couple of minutes, the warmupregulator will
stabilize at around 3.4 to 3.8 Bar.

If initial pressure is at system pressure (5.0 to 5.5 Bar)
something is stopped. That could be the warmup regulator
(Pressure gauge is before regulator), fuel return line or
maybe fuelfilter.

Note that some Bosch warmup regulators (not all) have an
input restrainer under the screw that connect the input fuelline.
In my case, the restrainer was clogged and good cleaning
took care of my problems.

A good reference to CIS system is :

"Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management" by Charles Probst

(A must if you want to troubleshoot Bosch injection systems.

Good Luck
