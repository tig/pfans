Hi, all (how many of you are there now???)

Ok, yet another question...

I've been looking for months for a good '87 to '89 Carrera coupe. I'm now
starting to think about a C2 instead - it's a stretch in terms of $$$, but
I figure I wouldn't get "2-foot-itis" (sailing term) quite as soon with a C2.

Now, the question-of-the-day... there's an '89 C4 available up here at
what seems to be an amazing deal (yeah, I know, I know...)

Apart from the obvious, what can anyone tell me about a C4 versus a C2?
I seem to recall reading about understeering tendencies and the 4WD
mechanism isn't the best?

I think I'd rather have a C2, but this particular car (which MUST have
something wrong with it!) is advertised at about $10K less than it
should be....

Cheers!

Ross
