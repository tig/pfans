O.K. now you've got me wondering.

Scanning the postings yesterday I noticed an e-mail from a chap who was wanting to know if the 
operating temp. of 220+ deg. on his '74 - 911 engine was normal and also an oil pressure that 
started out in the 60s when cold and dropping to near zero when hot. Mr. Watts kindly responded 
that these conditions were very abnormal and should be addressed immediately so as not to damage 
the engine.
I have been driving a '74 - 911 with a stock 2.7 cis for five years. The engine has always 
operated with similar readings and the car has always been serviced by an authorized porsche 
mechanic. I queried him about these conditions when I first started taking the car to him and I 
got the distinct impression that these were normal operating conditions. I am very pleased with 
the engine's performance and it has given me no reason to think that I've been running it under 
adverse conditions. I would hate to think otherwise.

Comments???

Thanks,
John
