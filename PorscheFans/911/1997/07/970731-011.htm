Hi Folks -

Wonder if anyone else has seen this.  My '83 SC has had the pressure fed
tensioners for 120k miles now.  Several times during that decade or so,
I've experienced a NASTY timing chain rattle.  It always happens after
the car is partway warmed up, parked on an incline (up or down seems not
to matter), allowed to cool partway, and then re-started... i.e. the
typical running-errand driving cycle.  If I crack the oil line banjo
fitting I get oil, so I think the supply is OK.

I'm getting towards pulling the engine soon to take care of a bunch of
peripheral items (tranny, oil t'stat, etc) and will have a close look at
the tensioners.  Maybe replace timing chains and ramps for good
measure.  Was wondering if anyone else has seen intermittent problems
with the pressure fed tensioners, and what the cause might have been?

Any comments appreciated
