I asked for help with a problem I was having a few months
back, and got some good advice.  But there were a few who had the 
problem and did not have a fix.  

My 85 Carrera fed back harshly through the steering wheel at highway
speeds, a sort of "beat frequency" of regular jerks.  I tried 
different tires, alignment, balance, changing suspension height, and
got no convincing improvement.  

Then I installed new shocks -- Koni Sport in this case -- and
the wheel is smooth as silk.  My impression was that even though
I couldn't tell it, the original struts -- Boge -- were very worn out.
The car felt stiff, not bouncy, and handling was OK.

A data point for your consideration.

Regards,   Jerry Mouton
