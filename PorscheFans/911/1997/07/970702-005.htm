Richard,

The chatter ... It's quite likely that you may have warped the rotors a bit
during the track sessions or by using the brakes to stop the car when
parking after a session which keeps the pads in contact with the rotor. I
warped my rotors in the first few times I took my C4 on track. In my
experience, with minor warpage, the vibrations seemed to come and go as
rotor temp varied over the course of a commute. I often felt it when they
were cold but as the rotors got warm/hot the vibrations became much less
noticeable. If it is only a minor warble felt with brake pressure at speed,
you can (1) live with it since it isn't dangerous (2) try to have the
rotors trued up (by removing material) at a shop but this doesn't always
help, or (3) ultimately replace the rotors and try not to warp the new ones.

As to pads ... The advantage of track pads are firmer brake feel and
crisper stopping due to higher friction. The downside is (1) some brands of
pads combine friction with abrasion and wear the rotors faster, (2) there
are proponents of every brand around so you'll be given lots of advice
(good luck!), and (3) the pads will squeal or squeak. (Some would venture
that squeal can be avoided with backing plates and applications of goop to
the corners of the pads; but I still got squeal.) I used Pagid orange pads
during the track season last year. They were great on track but had the
unfortunate effect of causing my C4 to sound like an 18-wheeler whenever I
braked while tooling around town. The squeal became too much to bear and
this season I'm using OE Textar pads for street and track and they are OK.
(i.e. I can live with poorer brake feel as a trade for the lack of squeal).

So, since you don't want to change pads before and after events, I suggest
you stay with street pads and work on braking technique and cooling your
brakes for the track to make them last longer. Technique is about using the
brakes less of the time but more intensely. Ask any instructor at the next
event to chat/demonstrate some of that. Cooling can be arranged with air
scoops that attach under the car and direct air to the calipers. There are
a variety of sources for these such as AJ-USA who advertise in Panorama, or
Northstar who advertise in the Chicago region Scene, and local shops that I
can recommend for installation. In all events, it's always a god idea to
bleed your brakes before each event so you start with a firm brake pedal.
Drop me a line if you want to chat about any of this or call me at
