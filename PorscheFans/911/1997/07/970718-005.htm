Subject:    Speeding


Since going beyond the speed limit is the national sport in many countries,
there is universal disdain for those uniformed creatures
who stop you while you are driving. Here are a few things better
left unsaid.
 - Hey, you must've been doing' about 125mph (200km/h) to keep
   up with me!   Good job!

 - Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize my radar detector
   wasn't plugged in.

 - I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition
   to be a Police Officer.

 - Excuse me. Is "stick up" hyphenated?

 - Hi Officer, Do you mind holding my beer while I find my
   driver's license?

 - You know, I was going to be cop, but I decided to finish
   high school instead.

 - "Bad Cop! No Donut!"

 - I was trying to keep up with traffic.  Yes, I know there is
   no other car around,  that's how far I am behind the other cars.

 - You're NOT gonna check the trunk, are you?

 - "Lets do it different this time... I will give you the
    breathalyzer test,  now stick this in your mouth and blow"

 - Didn't I see you get your but kicked on "COPS" last week on TV?

 - Wow, You look just like the guy in the picture on my
   next to my girlfriend's bed.

 - I bet I could grab that gun before you finish writing my ticket

 - So, uh, you "on the take", or what?

 - Gee, officer!  That's terrific.  The police officer yesterday
   only gave me a warning too!

 - Do you know why you pulled me over? Good, at least one of us does.

 - So, are you still crabby because your mamma didn't let you play with
   your gun when you were little?

 - Hey is that a 9 mm? That's nothing compared to this .44 magnum.

 - When you smack the crap outta me, make sure you
   smile pretty for the video camcorder.

 - Is it true that people become policemen because they are too
   dumb to work at McDonalds?'
