You mentioned in the states where radar detectors are illegal you just
left it on.  Well, you best not try that in Virginia, because they have
detector detectors.  Most if not all radar detectors emit a radio
frequency signal and they just have recievers tuned to that frequency. 
They can "hear" a detector about 1/4 of a mile.  So be careful in Va.
