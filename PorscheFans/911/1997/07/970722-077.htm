I recently purchased a quart of the "transseal" latex bra (the same product
discussed in the digest about a month ago).  Prior to a PCA event, I applied
it to the front of my 911, as direct. After the event, there were a few areas
where the latex appears to have been "dimpled" from road debris, while the
underlying paint looked unblemished.  Success!... or was it?

The problems started the next day when I attempted to remove the latex. The
material pealed easily off of the painted surfaces but stuck tenaciously to
the vinyl trim and rubber head light gaskets..... 4 hours of tweezer work
later..!!. There was also an appreciable color difference on the paint
surfaces that I had just uncovered.  This turned out to be caused by either a
removal or discoloration of the wax.  After cleaning with a pre-wax cleaner
and re-waxing the paint luster was restored to normal.

Asside from wasting an enter day, no harm - no foul.

Has anyone had a similar experience with this product?  In retrospect, I
obviously should not have paint over vinyl and rubber with latex....duh.  But
what about the paint discoloration?  I'm obviously a little hesitant to get
out my roller again....  Was my mistake leaving it on overnight?
