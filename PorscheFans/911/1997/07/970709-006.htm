Found it !  Phew...  Muffler leak where tailpile mounts to exhaust
pipe from heat exchanger.  Complete circumferential shearing due to
metal failure (rust) at that point.  Assorted noises were due to 
pieces rubbing together, exhaust whistling past the break, and more
noticeable racecar exhaust sound on deceleration.
