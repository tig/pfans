Blake:

There's a company called Cover-It (800 932-9344) that makes tent-like
"instant garages" specifically for this purpose.  Prices start around
$200, and they come in lots of sizes... You should be able to get one
that just fits around your car.

If the wife doesn't like that idea, I'd probably suggest putting any
old cotton or flannel cover on the car, then covering it with a
waterproof plastic tarp.  It'll be ugly, but it'll keep the car
more-or-less dry.

In either case, you might want to toss a couple of big dessicant
bags into the interior to keep the interior humidity down.
