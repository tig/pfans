It's interesting that no one commented on this.  I don't believe that
ATE Super Blue Racing is not DOT certified.  I'm not a tech writer or an
attorney, nor do I play one on TV, but I read the info on the side of
the can to be DOT approved.

Here's what I an reading from the side of an ATE blue can:

"Better than specifications of FMVSS No. 116 DOT 4/DOT 3 (differing blue
coloration), SAE J 1703 and ISO 4925.  Suitable for all brake and clutch
systems rated for DOT brake fluids, and naturally suitable for ABS."

Now, here's what I read from the back of a bottle of Castrol GT LMA
brake fluid, which I don't think anyone would doubt it being DOT
approved:

"Meets specifications SAE J1703, FMVSS No. 116 DOT 3 and DOT 4 MOTOR
VEHICLE BRAKE FLUID."

My understanding of both ATE blue and Ate Type 200 amber were they were
totally compatible and have the same specs, that it was only a color
difference.
