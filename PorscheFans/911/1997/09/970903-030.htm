It feels kinda funny driving around without a rearview mirror doesn't
it?  

Anyway, as others have advised, go to an auto parts store and get some
"rear view mirror" adhesive.  The clerk will know what you need.  

From experience, here's a couple of tips for you:

1)  *Before* trying to re-attach the metal mounting shoe to the
windshield, remove *all* of the leftover glue from both the windshield
and mounting shoe.

2) Using a paper towel or tissue moistened with alcohol, wipe the area
of the windshield where the mirror mounting shoe will go.  Wipe the
metal mounting shoe too.  The alcohol removes any skin oil that will
interfere with the glue's sticking ability.

3) **Don't** use too much glue on the mounting shoe.  (Don't ask.)   
Remember, the shoe will be pressed flat against the windshield.  Too
much glue and you'll have *a mess* to clean up.  

4) Give the glue a few hours, preferably overnight, to cure, then
*carefully* re-mount the mirror stem onto the shoe. 

Good luck.

*clunk*  What the hell was that?  Oh, it's just the rear view
mirror.
