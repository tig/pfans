Thanks for all of the replies for my wiper problems. I received about 20
personal emails and to summarize, there is a split over wether it was
the intermittant relay or the wiper stalk. I decided to check the relay
and potentiometer first and they seem to be OK (contacts working and
proper voltages and grounds in the appropriate places, although 1 of the
diodes does seem out of tolerences. From what I can tell in the wiring
diagrams, it has to do with the intermittant speed rather than the
parking function). Unfortunately I'm going on vaca in a couple of days
(won't hear THAT very often!)and won't have time to check the wiper
stalk for a week or so. I'll let everyone know how it turns out. I'm
sorry if I didn't respond to everyone personally but I do appreciate the
info. Thanks again

Frank
