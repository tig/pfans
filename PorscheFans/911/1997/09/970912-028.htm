I don't believe I'm getting into this, but I'm finding this more and more
grating as it goes on.

The guy drives a car you admire. Why does this oblige him in *any* way to
talk to you about it, or anything else? Particularly if you try to get things 
rolling with a statement as cliched/self-evident as "Lot's of racing heritage 
in the 911, don't you agree?". The guy wants to be left alone, it's his
right.

And it's *not* a gold chain thing. The guy is running his car at Nationals.
Real gold chain. It's just that the perception that runs through our society
of Porsche as a status symbol can be a real PITA for those of us who bought
the car to drive, not to yack about with the really small segment(not!) of
the population who regards the car as a status symbol on wheels.

Case in point. I look young enough that I can't buy alcohol without getting
carded, I drive an '87 911. Folks on this list know you can buy that car for
$20K, and I paid less for my 911 than my Volvo. But everyone else assumes
that the car costs an arm and a leg, right? *Every* conversation at the block
party my neighborhood recently had so folks could get to know their neighbors
started with "You're the guy who drives the Porsche, right?", "How can
you afford that?"(ignoring the fact that these people are all living in $150K+
houses, driving $30K cars), blah, blah, blah. The same thing happened at a
recent wedding that I drove the car to(hey, 500 mile road trip, like I'm
going to take anything else). Lots of inane chatter. On the upside, I did get
into one interesting conversation with the father of the bride(otherwise a
*very* retiring man) about his waiting-for-restoration 911, but there was a lot 
of other "standard" Porsche related conversation. Yes, I own a 911. Yes, I love 
the car.  Autocrossing is about the most fun I've ever had fully clothed. But 
the car is NOT a substitute for my personality, I don't like having it treated 
that way, and I'd like to talk about something else 98% of the time. I bought
the car to drive, and enjoy, not to talk about and be admired in. I can't
be the only person who feels this way. Sure, the original poster could have
been blown off more politely, but a brush-off is a brush-off. 

In a related(and lighter) note, I seem to recall P.J. O'Rourke describing a
911 as a really expensive marital aid. My experince on the road(judging by
the demographic group that can't resist screaming "Nice car" as I drive by)
is that that may be the case, but only if you've got a thing for 12-year old 
boys...
