In two weeks I will be attending my first GCR driver's ed on track.

On my 993 the headlight assembly is easily removed with one lever.  I was 
wondering if anyone has tried removing these.

Does it keep the oil temp lower to run without the headlight assemblies?

What aerodynamic problems has anyone had doing this?

Does anyone know of a source for a stonegard that would fit into the 
headlight assembly opening to prevent damage?

Any input would be appreciated.
