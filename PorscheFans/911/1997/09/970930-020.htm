     We took the '89 Carrera which burns too much oil to a recent driving 
     school at Texas World Speedway (Lone Star Region PCA).  We had two 
     drivers driving it each day.
     
     The results are that it burned only 3 quarts over the entire weekend.  
     The trip included two 200 mile highway drives and the driving school.  
     This included several tanks of gas.  It may seem silly, but the car 
     seemed to burn less oil per gallon of gas during this trip than before 
     during city/highway use.
     
     For now, we will live with the extra oil consumption and the smoke at 
     start up.
