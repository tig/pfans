The tinker virus has bitten me and thought I would seek advice from you
good people.  I have been a Porchefans subscriber for only about a week,

so much of this is probably from the department of redundency
department.  The car I have driven daily for about 9 months is a 1984
Euro Targa Carrera with near-new shocks, struts, and tires (P7000s).

Since Porche has made their engines in the 911 produce more hp more than

once by making them "breath" easier it seems the easiest and least
expensive way to get more output would be to install one of those freer
flowing air cleaners - K&N being mentioned quite a lot.  Would a K&N air

filter make a noticable difference?

The next ladder step would seem to be a DME chip upgrade.  Performance
Products indicates they have a Euro chip for the 84 while Automotion is
U.S. spec only.  Do the positives (manufacturers claims) outweigh the
negatives (increased stress on the engine) here in anyone's experience?
This also seems to be a relatively straightforward and relatively
inexpensive way to boost performance.

If the above mods are made, would it be suggested that I also upgrade
front and rear sway bars to 87 spec?  Now we are getting into a little
bit more $$$ than I wish when it is all totaled up.  I do, however, have

9" BBS rear wheels that could accomodate the 245/40 rear tire.

Thank you in advance for your feedback.
