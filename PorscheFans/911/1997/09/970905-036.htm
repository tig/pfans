<<So, the super would appear to be better for the around-town driver, where
jumping out at the light or getting into traffic quickly is needed. As
opposed to the top-end speed, which you can't go to anyway (unless your
commute includes the Autobahn).>>

I disagree.  Your statements about the performance edges of supercharging and
turbos are correct, but I wouldn't say that supercharging would be the best
bet.  As I posted before I drive a 911 turbo everyday.  Although the 930
isn't as quick as some cars off the line the turbo spools up and kicks in at
3,000 rpm and you are gone!!  In traffic all you'd have to do is kick it down
to 2nd gear and go!  If you want to reduce turbo lag just add a
header/muffler system, 1 bar boost spring, and possibly intercooler and SC
cams.  If you change the turbo you can even get it to spool up by 2,000 rpm.
 I had a Mustang GT with a supercharger and would have to say go for the
turbo.  Esp. on a Porsche.  Just an opinion.
