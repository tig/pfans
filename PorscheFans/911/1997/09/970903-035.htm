My '86 911 is running a bit rough, especially when cold, when it seems
to be running too rich (evidence -stronger than normal odor of gasoline
in garage at startup).  I was told by my wrench that I could perform a
15,000 tune (valve adjust, plugs, etc.), which I did, but that I would
need his professional assistance to "adjust the fuel mixture".

Is there any real adjustment of the fuel mixture, beyond the idle
control?

Also, I'm wondering if the problem could be a bad oxygen sensor, and if
so, is there a way to test before I spend the bucks for a new one?

I also noted in the Haynes manual that there is a need to "reset" the
oxygen sensor counter every 30,000 miles.   Perhaps I only need to
reset.  Anyone have any experience with this?

Thanks in advance for your help.
