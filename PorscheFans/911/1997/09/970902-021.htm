The bezels can be removed, but it takes some patience. The bezel (if you
look closely) is folded over the instrument casing, they must have a
special tool with rollers to do this. 

I first use a small screwdriver to pry up the bezel from the case where
it is folded. Then insert the screwdriver between the bezel and the case
and slide it around a few times expanding the bezel where it was folded.
Then use a larger screwdriver and repeat the last step until the bezel
is expanded enough to remove.

On re-assembly the bezel will still snap back on the case, then use a
smooth tool, like the side of a screwdriver to partially fold the bezel
back over the case. 

The glass on my fuel gage was cloudy around the edges.  I took it apart
and found clear plastic was glued to the inside of the glass, which had
partially de-laminated. I pulled the plastic off, cleaned the glass and
put it back together. 

QUESTION - My speedometer needle stays on the peg until I reach about 40
MPH, then it jumps up. It must need some kind of lubrication?? Does
anyone know how to fix this?
