For those of you that do not remember my 86 targa died the other night losing
every bit of electricity.
Turns out the alternator supplied by the local dealer 13 months ago failed.
Wait, it gets better.
Soooo I contacted another local dealer and they supplied a newly rebuilt and
covered the old one since Porsche
gives 2 year warranties with proof of receipt. Woo Hoo, wait it gets better, So
the wife and I decided after
looking at the service manual we would replace it ourselves and besides with
the extra money saved we could buy
a special bottle of appreciating squished grapes and celebrate! TASK #1 remove
the old alternator in 8 easy steps?
1.) loosen air conditioner compressor pump and slide off belt. not a problem,
expect for 1 13mm bolt way in the back left corner.
2.) remove 3 small bolts holding on the Spark plug wires and the air housing to
the alternator frame, again no problem. 
3.) Loosen big nut on alternator holding center with Allen head wrench, no
problem
4.) remove 3, 5mm nuts off the back housing behind alternator fan, wife
accomplished this while i took a break, 16 oz. preferred beverage.
5.) remove 3 wires B+ , D- & 61 as the book says, no problem
6.) attached in the reverse order, marriage saved, hugs kisses etc., high five
and away we go, nope battery light comes on again. 
7.) Turns out Newly rebuilt alt. was defective !@#$%&^$^, Throw fit, pant rant
and rave then
8.) Go to dealer get new alternator replace and car is fine.
All in All this is really a DIY project. Requiring only a 7mm 9mm hex wrench &
15/16"???? to hold alt. nut.  At least on my 1986 Targa.
The Labor bill from the Porsche dealer would have been 274.50. We saved enough
to buy a fine bottle of grape stuff, a big 'ole side of Beef, and a couple of
the biggest orange crawdads you ever seen!!!!!
Thanks, guys for all the support
Denny
