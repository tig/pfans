	I can vouch for this scenario. It just happened to me last night! I was
running through all of the CIS tests on my 911 (warm start problem - bad
check valve and marginal warm up regulator) and didn't really pay
attention to how much fuel I had shot down the cylinders. When I was
done I went to start the car and it wouldn't turn over. At first I
thought I had run down the battery by running the fuel pump too long
since I could hear the starter solenoid clicking. Then I noticed the
streak of gas heading down the driveway . . .  I ended up letting it sit
over night with the plugs out. Enough gas evaporated and leaked out into
the exhaust to let it start, although it did blow white smoke like crazy
for about 10 min until all of the excess gas burned out of the exhaust
system. I've done the same CIS tests dozens of times when I had VWs and
Audis without this happening. What makes the 911 motor so sensitive to
it?
