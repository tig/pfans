Dear all,

having recently purchased a 1968 911T and with the UK winter approaching
I am now paranoid about rust.  Other than Waxoyl the car has had no
specific rustproofing applied since it was rebuilt.  Does anyone have
any recommendations as to products/supplier that would allow me to enjoy
the car through the winter yet not have it drop apart with rust ?

Does anyone have experience of home pressure washers ?  Are they a good
buy or a waste of time & money compared to my garden hose approach to
washing under mudguards etc

Regards,

Ian.
