I've been doing research on new tires for a while (reference a couple of
postings some months back) and as it appears have narrowed it down to 3
candidates.  The requirements I have are:

	- reasonable cost (< $150/tire)
	- reasonable wear (15k+ for rears, more is better)
	- reasonable comfort for daily driver
	- given the above, best handling and performance for spirited
		around-town and daily driving, with reasonable performance
		at the few track events/year I have been doing, and very
		good wet performance (safety, not racing! :-)

It's an '87 Carrera with stock 16" Fuchs wheels (6, 7") that use 205/55 and
225/50 tires in front and rear respectively.

The candidates based on research are:

	Firestone SZ-50
	Dunlop SP-8000
	Dunlop D40M2

The Firestone is a new tire, apparently similar in design to the Bridgestone
S-02 (Bridgestone owns Firestone, the tires are made in the same factory?? and
were designed by the same designer??).  It is getting *rave* reviews by people
who've tried them although the sources (Usenet) are Corvette and Mustang owners
but with track experience and high performance use in mind.  I have not found
any Porsche owners with these.  I had my Carrera in the shop Friday and asked
the mechanic -- he was very negative on anything Firestone although was not
familiar with these.  He also knew of a number of owners who were unhappy with
the S-02's (quality problems).  The Tire Rack recommends the SZ-50's as their
first choice for my requirements, just slightly above the SP-8000.

The SP-8000 is well represented by happy Porsche owners.  Seems like a safe
choice with one possible exception: they must be *hot* to perform well?  Will
they work well when cold?

The D40M2 is the above-mentioned mechanic's favorite tire.  It is also less
expensive than the others above, at $100/tire.  His point is that unless the
car is really set up for maximum performance (mine's suspension is totally
stock), this tire is adequate, I won't feel any significant difference with the
better tires because of the suspension, and would be just throwing money away. 
(This shop is like that; they are always talking me *out* of spending more :-)

Can anyone on the list here provide some guidance, ideally with direct
comparisons of their own?

Thanks,
