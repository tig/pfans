Ross:

I'll give you a qualified "amen"... Your point's totally valid, but
only if the engine you're modifying is ALREADY optimized for its
existing components.  If it's not, replacing a component may correct
a problem caused by the FACTORY'S focus on a "components" rather
than a "systems" approach.

In general, the opportunities for bolt-on improvement are in areas
where the factory made compromises in favor of criteria other than
maximum power... Criteria like noise level, ride harshness,
emissions controls, insensitivity to poor-quality gasoline, etc.
