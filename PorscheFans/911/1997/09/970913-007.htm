FWIW, YMMV (all the usual caveats) but here's what I've done for
years with no ill effects:  I jack the car using my floor jack (with a
short piece of 2x4 in the "cup" for protection) under the floor pan
just inside the factory jacking point.  I then put the jack stands
under the torsion bars or the small flat part of the pan just under
the torsion bars.

I did this years ago out of frustration in finding a better place
to jack and still have room for the jack stands.  My logic was that
this area supports the weight of the car during normal jacking,
albeit via the welded tube, and it looks pretty sound due to the
rockers, etc., all coming together at this point.

Anyway, *my* floor pan is plenty strong at this point.  After years
of doing this, there is no noticeable impact (pun intended) to
the floor pan.

Good luck,
