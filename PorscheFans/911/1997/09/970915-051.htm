I just purchased a 1990 C2 Cabriolet Tip (with 19,000 miles).  I love the car 
with two exceptions.

1.  After about five minutes or so, a whistle sound develops.  It seems to be 
coming from the dashboard area.  I've tried everything in an effort to 
determine where it is coming from, e.g. turned the fan on and off, same with 
the ac, pounded on the dashboard (which seemed to work initially), etc., all 
to no avail.  The sound will not go away for the most part -unless of course 
when I'm on the way to the dealer to have it fixed, in which case it's silent. 
 Has any one had a similar problem.  

2. Also, the tiptronic will not go past 6150 rpms in first gear, which is 
extremely frustrating.  After all, my wife made me get the automatic and now 
doesn't even drive the car.  I find the automatic to be significantly slower 
than the manual and would not recommend it.  Any suggestions on adjusting the 
shift points, chip or otherwise?

Let me know.
