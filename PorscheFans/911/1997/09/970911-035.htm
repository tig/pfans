I had some transmission work done on my 87 Carrera. The car was at the shop
for over two weeks, and was supposed to be returned to me today. I just
talked to the mechanic who told me that the transmission and clutch are
wonderful, but there is now a strange noise coming from the engine. His
suspicion is a collapsed tensioner that apparently is not building back oil
pressure. He said that that doesn't happen usually, but sometimes it does.
He also said that it may be due to the fact that the engine sat for a
while, but in any case after running it for a while it should build some
pressure back. Incidentally, they also adjusted the valves while the engine
was out (he said the noise cannot be from the valves).

I'm going to the shop to hear the noise in a while. Does anyone have any
idea what may be happening here? Is that a common problem? Should they have
done something to the engine while it sat waiting for the transmission work
to be done? Anything they should have done after they put it back together?
Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. Please respond direct to me,
since I receive the digest and would like responses as soon as possible.


Thanks,

Gabriel
