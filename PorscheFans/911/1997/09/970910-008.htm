    The gauge should begin to read after the engine is out of the white zone at
    the bottom of the oil temperature gauge. This defines "warmed up" for a
    911. I might add that you should not let the engine exceed 4500 RPM before
    this time as well. If you are not reading in the white on the level gauge
    at the first (level ground) stop after warm-up then you definitely need
    oil. I prefer the "three o'clock" level as a fill rule. I know this is
    heresy, but you can bag the dipstick as long as the gauge is working.

I agree completely. If you follow my topping off method that's 
exactly what you'll get, otherwise the dipstick shows full and the 
guage takes forever to come out of the red.
