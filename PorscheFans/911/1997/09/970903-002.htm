 I had my '80 SC suddenly stumble & practically die while I was on my way to
my mechanic.  I barely made it there.  It turned out to be the lambda
control circuit relay (under the passenger front seat).  It was clicking in
and out all along and finally crapped out.  My car had similar symptoms.  I
don't know if this is your problem, but maybe it is just a coincidence that
you had gotten gas & washed the car.  It's worth a look if nothing else
works.

>I have an interesting problem.  Am interested if anyone has a quick fix.
My
>83 911SC (90K miles exactly) has run great for the 3 yrs I've owned it.  It
>was running great the other day, I stopped and got gas, then took it home
and
>washed it.  When I started it to put it in the garage, it started hard, ran
>rough, and barely made it into the garage.  I left it alone for 3 days,
then
>the next time I tried to start it, it started, ran for 2 seconds, and quit.
> DId this over and over for 4-5 tries, same thing, then finally it wouldn't
>start at all.  I tried it again the next day, and it started, but ran
rough.
> I tried to take it around the block, and it barely made it up the hill.
It

>got bad gas.  That seems to have made a big difference, as car runs pretty
>good now, but it still lacks power and I can sense it is not runnning as
>smooth as it should at high revs.  A slight "wobble" to the engine.

coil,

O2

>90K miles on the nose.  I reset the O2 light, but that is surely PURE
>coincidence.

Thanks.
