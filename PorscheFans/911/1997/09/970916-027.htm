Brian,

The problem is almost certainly valve guides.  A better way to judge
the above test is to have someone follow you and see if they
can see smoke when you decel.  Also, I have heard that you should
accelerate hard in gears 1-3, then lift and let the car come almost
to a complete stop, *with* someone following you.  It is very rare
that the driver can see smoke in this test.

Good luck and let us know what you find out.

This is distressing since you just bought the car and the previous
owner must have known about the problem and obviously said nothing
to you about it.  I wonder how many Carrera's have changed hands this
way.  Small comfort, but you are not alone, I'm sure.
