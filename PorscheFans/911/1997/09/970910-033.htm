Well I was at Carlsen's the other day, saw a Turbo S in the back lot where 
cars wait for repairs.

Having never seen one in the flesh (metal?), I closely admired the car, 
then saw the whole front bumper assy was off.  Huh?  Asked the mechanic, 
and he said the car was in because of leaking front oil cooler and/or 
related hoses and connectors.  Right next to it, guess what, a '97 targa 
was in with the same condition!  And further down the row?  A '97 cab and a 
coupe, same problem!

I didn't know this was so endemic to the '97 cars.

Bob
'97, no leaks, so far.

I was behind a TurboS the other day on the freeway in Dallas.
Admiring the wide rolling fenders, big poking dual exhaust, shiny red 
finish,
wide monster
meats all tucked up inside the fenders, Super-Model Blonde Girl friend ? 
 when
all of a sudden he launched the thing!
We were doing about 80 and he was so far gone in ~4 sec. you couldn't even 
tell
what it color it was.
Please no hate mail about racing we we're just keeping up. Honest
The Question is could someone who owns one of these marvels please describe 
to
the rest
of us in exacting detail what that must feel like? Not the blonde, 930 and 
any
other specially prepped owners as well.
It was just awesome to visualize. Forget the Turbo Look Posting...Now 
seeking
90's turbo/super
Denny
