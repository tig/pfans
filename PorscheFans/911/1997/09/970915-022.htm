What. Either that, or the original post(and yours as well) are flame bait as
well. Take your pick.

"If you really exist"? Is this a new debating technique I'm not up on?

> your diatribe

OK. Quick test. Given person A and person B...
Person A wants to talk to person B about person B's possesion C(regardless of
what it is), and person B doesn't want to talk to person A. Person A then
goes off and complains to another group of people about person B's behavior,
wrapping it the guise of "I thought people who owned C were better than
that." Who is the prick?

Now, my reasoning is that it is person A. For three reasons. 1: He seems to
think that person B is obliged to speak to him, regardless of how assinine
the conversation. 2: He's stupid enough to think that owning possesion C
means *anything* about person B other than he managed to acquire it somehow.
3: He's a whiner for going off and complaining to a whole bunch of other
people about it and expecting back-up. Particularly when he says "I don't
want flames, just people's opinions"(i.e. "I don't want to hear from you if
you don't agree with me.").

This self-congratulatory "Porsche owners should be better than that" garbage
is just as elitist as the "gold chain" set, and just as wrong. No matter how
nice a car a Porsche is, it's still just a car, and doesn't say a damn thing
about the driver. And that was part of the thrust of my original post.

And the rest of my point is that most people seem to think that owning a
Porsche is a lifestyle statement, or a major component of a person's
personality. For some folks that may be true, it's not for me. And it grates 
on me that people assume it is.

And your point? I'm not sure if you think I should defer to you because of
this(in which case you are sorely mistaken), or think that I look down on you
because of this(in which case you are sorely mistaken). Everybody drives the
intersection of what they want and what they can afford. So?

> If you don't want to or know how to answer
> a non-owner's question, refer them to a Porsche owner that does.

And if the non-owners "question" is pointless chatter? If the first poster had
a real question, he should have come out and asked, not tried to engage the
guy in inane small-talk. I've got no problem with discussing good places for
maintenance, the less expensive P-cars to own, how much it really costs to
own a P-car, the weaknesses/strengths of particular models/years, whatever. 
But, like I said, 98% of the conversations that are thrust on me about the car 
are inane small-talk. Life is too short.

> Do you flash your headlights?

Nope. I was taught that you use headlight flashes to convey important
information(speed traps, enough clearance to merge, etc.). I do return
people's waves regardless of what they're driving, but I rarely initiate
them. Most of the time I'd rather be paying attention to traffic conditions.

Having said my piece, and clairified it, have fun. If you disagree, more
power to you, but if you really think that anyone driving a Porsche is
obliged to talk to you about it, get ready for disappointment.
