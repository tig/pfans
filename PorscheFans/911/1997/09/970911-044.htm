<<Could it also be possible that other radar detectors are better than the
Valentine?  I'd love to start a new thread, if it is use>>

Well, the Valentine One is the best mounted detector, but is big and a little
unsightly.  The absolute best detector you can buy is a K40, but they will
set you back at least $600 and must be installed in your vehicle (they have a
module mounted in your front bumper, and module in the rear of your car, and
the remote receiver somewhere in your dash).  They even come with a warranty
- they will pay any ticket, no matter how fast you were going - for the first
year you own the detector.  Find any other company that does that.  I have
one mounted in my 928S4 and can say that it consistently picks up police
before my Escort Solo.
New thread?
