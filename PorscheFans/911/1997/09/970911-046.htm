I had to laugh as I read the thread about some Porsche owners being
jerks....it reminded me of the time (about 10 years ago) I went in to the
Tacoma Wasington Porsche dealership to gawk.  I was drooling over a 911 when
a snooty sales guy slides over and says, "Can I help you with something?"  Of
course I was young and the only thing I could say to him was, "Yes, how much
does a pooorsh like this one cost?"  He then said to me, "'Porsh-a', is a two
syllable word."  In Tacoma it rains a lot (365 days a year).  I swear that
when he said that sentence, he should have drowned his nose was so far in the
air.  If I had had the presence of mind I would have said something to the
effect of, "Hey mister, you are SELLING CARS FOR A LIVING!" (not that there
is any thing wrong with that but what gave him the right to be that snotty to
a 16 year old kid? He probably went home in his Plymouth Horizon)  Anyway,
since purchasing my 911s, I have noticed that many other Porsche drivers are
a bit arrogant.  This is largely due to the fact that "the masses" treat
Porsche's as status symbols rather than a unique piece of automotive
engineering.  I am sure that these same "snobs" will someday move up to
owning their very own Jaguar XJ, just to make sure that everyone knows that
they have a lot of money....(they probably share a home with 12 other
families and have a house payment of $4.50 a month and a $950 dollar car
payment...but they sure look good cruising down the road.)  Enough of this I
suspect...In addition to my 911s, I also have a restored MGB (chrome bumper)
and find that when out on the roads, other MG drivers will practically wreck
their cars in an effort to wave...funny, have never had the same experience
in the Porsche....regards and happy waving!
