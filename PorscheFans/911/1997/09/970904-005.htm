In a previous query, I asked about a problem where my oil pressure and =
e-brake warning lights were flickering in unison at idle. Feedback from =
P-Fans, a pointer to a Bruce Anderson article, and a look at a wiring =
diagram convinced me that the problem was/is probably a failing oil =
pressure sensor switch. As an update, the switch appears to have failed =
completely. The lights remain on at all oil pressures and temps. The =
pressure and temp gauges continue to read normally and I see no sign of =
leaks.=20

Now I'm at the point of being tired of having the red lights on all the =
time and, rather than disconnect them, I'd like to replace the pressure =
switch. My question to the P-Fans is: Where the heck is the switch? =
Having once replaced the oil temp sensor, I know which one it's NOT. I =
believe the other one near the temp sensor is the pressure gauge sensor. =
A look in my Haynes manual seems to indicate it may be located forward, =
to the right (passenger) side of the flywheel near a thermostat. My car =
is an '84 Carrera, and I cannot see the area to confirm location. My =
assumption is that I MAY be able to get at the switch if I remove some =
items from the top of the engine. Before I begin, I was hoping to obtain =
some helpful hints. PLEASE don't tell me this requires engine removal! =
Well, if you tell me that, please be gentle ...  ;^)

While I'm here ... I'm also anticipating replacement of the front strut =
shock cartridges. One of them has a small amount of looseness which I =
can feel if I jack up the car and apply hand pressure about half-way up =
the strut (The struts are Boge). The Haynes manual procedure says to =
totally remove the strut from the car. Is this really necessary? I think =
I saw a discussion in this forum which described a method which did not =
disconnect from the ball joint. If true, could someone please point me =
at the relevant date(s) in the archives or advise me of the procedure?

Many thanks,
