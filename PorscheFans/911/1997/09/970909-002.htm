Gut Morgen to you, Steve and Pfans,

No, that was the strange thing:  the dipstick showed *approximately* the 
same amount of oil before and after I added a quart.

Now that I think about it some more, I actually have never been able to get 
an *clean* reading from the dipstick.  The reason is that as I pull the 
stick out, wipe it clean, reinsert all the way in, and pull out again, I 
cannot help but think that it must rub against the side of the tube holding 
it both on the way in (after being cleaned) and on its way back out.

As the inside of the tube is coated with oil from the first time it was 
pulled out, the stick is invariably smeared with oil pretty much its entire 
length.  Sure, there's oil in the "twisty" section where you're supposed to 
take the reading, but obviously this is negated by the fact that there's 
oil on the entire stick!  Ha, I *knew* my dipstick was lying!

Now I don't know about the earlier 911s, but on the 993 the dipstick is so 
long and it has to be fairly flexible (it actually looks more like a wire 
or twisted-strand thin cable) to get through a tube that starts out 
horizontal and (I assume) ends vertically into the oil tank.  Being long, 
flexible, and forced through a bent tube it is impossible to get a "clean" 
dip, unlike my other non-P cars where the stick is short and straight and 
it is a vertical shot down to the oil tank.

So how do P-fans get a "clean" reading with their dipsticks, assuming all 
have the long  and flexible wire type stick?

TIA, again
Bob

Good Morning,

One question. When you added the quart of oil to force the gauge to
read higher, did the oil level on the dip stick change at all?
