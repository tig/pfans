I converted my 911 over with a Weltmeister short shift about 8 months =
ago.  I love it.  Yes it is harder shifting (not much) but most of that =
is caused by the changes in leverage  by the shorter top part and longer =
bottom. =20
With my height of 6'3" it gets to be a bit of a reach to 1,3,5 but not =
unbearable.

I found the Weltmeister quality to be very acceptable.

many people are unhappy with the kits. He heard people complain that the =

kit, and what they thought of it.
