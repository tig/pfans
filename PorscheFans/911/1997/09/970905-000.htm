I have to agree with Dave here, but the lesson is clear--never allow an
incident to cloud your judgement or drive your behavior. You should have
given yourself some time to let the excess adrenaline get out of your
system before you called the shop. Since you were able to drive the car it
should have been left at home until you could develop a plan. I say this
because you had a good indication that something serious was wrong and this
is a golden opportunity for a shop to cash in. Sorry, but that is the way
of things--Hiemrath might have just gotten the bill for his kids fall
semester at university...

On the other hand, like Dave pointed out, we don't really know exactly what
transpired between you and the shop owner. Remember, the Porsche is owned
by many people who could care less about the cost of a top-end
rebuild--they just want the car back quickly. You may have led Hiemrath to
believe that he was "to fix it" and he went about it in his usual
way--which, of course, turned out to be not the way you wanted and for far
more than you wanted to pay.
