Suggestions sought-

I have an '84 Carrera with 150k on it.  The car has a history of going through 
alternators.  Last September I had to replace the voltage regulator in the 
alternator.  Shortly after this we retrofit a temperature sensing circuit to 
run the engine electric fan that sucks air across the alternator when the 
shroud around the alternator gets too hot.  Thought this would prolong the 
life of the alternator.  This last June the car would not turn over until I 
got a jump (battery is less than 1 year old).  This happened again about 6 
weeks ago, so we replaced the alternator, this time the whole thing, with a 
rebuilt one.  Well today the car would not start.  Happened a couple of times 
during the day.  After the 4th or 5th hit of the key it would turn over and 
roar to life.  I could hear the starter solenoid clicking, but the starter 
motor would not budge.  Once it started I noticed the in car digital 
voltmeter, installed by Ray Calvo the PO, was reading 11.7.  No amount of 
engine reving would get it to break 12.  However, the discharge idiot light 
was not on.  Finally by switching an electric fan on and off I got the thing 
to start charging as the voltmeter shot up to 13.3 settling later at 12.7.
