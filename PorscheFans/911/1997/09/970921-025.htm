We have a member with such a vehicle and I've been around long enough to see
and drive a few 327/350 powered 911's. 

First off the 915 trans does not appreciate the speed torque curve of a V8
and 1st gear  dies rather quickly. Most just use 2nd gear as 1st gear and
live with a 4spd.  The weight bias becomes totally obscene really requiring
more spring rate than torsion bars alone can handle otherwise you have a
heavily squatting car that can't handle worth a Bevis and Butthead dump -
fine for the freeway drag race but don't try making an on or off ramp at
speed. Lift throttle oversteer is redefined to the utmost obscene.... 

The $4500 will go into the resale value. The $1800 will make the car
worthless to all but the high school buyer.

(reply to:)

I'm looking for information on changing out a 2.7 in a 1977 911 to a small
block LT1 chevy. A friend of mine is looking to make this change and needs
info from people who have made this change.  He is making this change because
he is lookig at replacing the current 2.7 with a 3.0 for $4,500.00 or get the
Chevy for $1,800.00 including
the install kit. He will use the same trans and gearbox. Will his car still
be accepted in the PCA?
