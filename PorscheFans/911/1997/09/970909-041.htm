Jim:

Yes; if the backlash isn't set precisely right, the ring and
pinion will indeed be noisy.  However, the noise it makes doesn't
sound like loose sheetmetal unless the R&P is REALLY misadjusted.

If it is your R&P, you should be able to make it act up by putting 
the car in first or second gear, coasting along in gear with neutral 
throttle (that is, neither accelerating nor decelerating -- a slight 
downward incline helps here), then gently pressing and releasing the 
throttle a little so the car alternately accelerates and decelerates 
a small amount.

As the R&P gears switch back and forth between their driving and 
driven surfaces, you should hear the noise.  Try it and let us 
know what happens.
