Mr. Klein,

When I finally took the plunge and ordered my 993 car from the factory,
my salesperson at Carlsen was adamant that I spring for the litronic
headlight option.  Being mostly performance oriented, I originally
perceived this feature to be a waste of hard earned money.

Since I've owned the vehicle I can truly say that the lights are worth
the additional investment.  While I shall leave a scientific explanation
of this technology to more capable hands (Mr. Ray Calvo???), I can
share my experiences.  The lights afford the driver a far more clear,
bright, and precise view of the road ahead.  I'm in my early thirties
and have no difficulty with night driving, but the extra focus and
sharpness cannot be compared to traditional lighting.  When first
deployed, the litronic beams seem to flicker a moment before stabilizing
into what is best described as a cold blue light.  While no brighter
than normal headlights, these beams are very distinct and your car
will stand out at night.

They were a $1,500 option for my Coupe and I know they are standard
fare on the vaunted Twin Turbo.  I believe that a similar technology
can be found on the more high-tone BMWs (740s?) as well as the latest
Lincoln Town Car.  Recently saw an advertisement in Excellence where
a dealership was selling a litronic headlight upgrade kit for $1,600.
Not a bad deal there.

Finally, the aforementioned Carlsen salesperson (Michael Hobgood) just
returned from a month long vacation in Europe where he told me how
many cars were seen sporting the litronic beams.  Just as ABS brakes
were the rage a few years back, he feels strongly that these lights
will be the next big ticket item.  If your budget allows, I highly
recommend this option.

I'm presently looking for a 993 Twin Turbo and take solace in the fact
that my next car will have same.  Knowing what I know now, I really
wouldn't want to drive a car at night without them.

David W. Pancerz
