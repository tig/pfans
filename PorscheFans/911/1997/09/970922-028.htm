I want to thank the people who helped me identify the fender
oil cooler I described in a previous post - Tom Smith, Bob
Tindel, Ed Yourkovich, Gregg Kricorissian, Dave Buhain (nice
exploded .gif picture of cooler).  This list and the people who
participate provide a wonderful resource of information.

Everyone agreed that the cooler was a carrera cooler (84-86)
with one reservation - it should have had metal louvers on the
wheel side that were integral with the sheet metal that
controlled airflow around the cooler.  The one I was to buy
didn't have them.  When I went to pick up the cooler last
night, the owner explained that he had removed the louvers with
metal snips and replaced them with a wire mesh, hoping to
improve airflow through the cooler.  He couldn't provide any
before/after comparisons since he did the modification before
installing the cooler the first time.
