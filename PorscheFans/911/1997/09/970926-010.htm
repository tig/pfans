This isn't a direct quote, but factory blurbs are a regular part of
PANO, and I was a Pano subscriber when the 911SC first came out.  There
was little if any discussion of what "SC" meant at the time, no doubt
because the designation was already familiar as the ultimate incarnation
of the 356.  The 356 series went through pre-A, A, B, and C stages, the
latter representing the end of the line ('64-'65).  The SC was a "super"
version of the C, with a more advanced engine--one that would continue
another four years as the powerplant for the 912.

The '78 model year marked the introduction of the 928, which was
intended to have more of a future than it ended up having.  The 924 was
already in production then, and the factory was aiming at retiring the
rear-engine, air-cooled series.  As we approached 1980, the air was rife
with predictions that this, then the next, then the next year would be
the last for the 911 series.  It didn't happen, of course, and the rest
is history.

So, as I understand it, the SC was a parallel designation for what was
supposed to be the last evolutionary stage of the 911, just as it was
for the 356.
