It's generally dry and warm here in Dallas winters.  I'd be glad to keep 
your car for the winter, and I'll even feed it and exercise it daily.

Subject: wet weather storage predicament


Hi all, Here's an odd one for you,

My '91 930 is likely going to have to stay outside this seattle winter.
Doesn't snow much, rains a bunch (duh).   Here's the predicament:
I have plenty of space to park the car without blocking garage entry,
but zoning laws prevent me from building a separate garage bay.  So...
I can either leave it out in the rain, cover it with a car cover, or 
have a
custom tent-like structuer built, that is just big enough to cover the 
car
(my spouse is just wild about this last idea <not>).  What's best and 
why?
If you think a car cover, from what materials should the cover be made.
Who makes the best?

The car is in phenomenal shape and I'd like to keep it that way.  (yeh, 
I
know, if the above is true I should just kick the daily drivers out of
the garage).

Any advice appreciated,
