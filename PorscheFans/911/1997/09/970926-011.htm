There are 4 levers on the dash (color coded - black levers/knobs control
fresh air; red levers/knobs control heated air):
	A - top left - fresh air intake vent; left is closed, right is open.
	B - top right - fresh air fans speed; left is off, right is high.
	C - middle - fresh air routing; left is footwells, right is windscreen.
	D - bottom - hot air routing; left is footwells, right is windscreen.

There are two levers and a rotary knob on the center console by the handbrake:
	E - two red levers - turn the heater (and the primary fan in the
		engine bay) on and off; up is on, down is off.
	F - rotary knob - the heater's secondary fan speed control;
		0 is off, 3 is high.

On the dash, note the directional "hint" arrows/triangles near levers
A thru D (the left hand-arrow point down to the footwells, the right-hand
arrow points up to the windscreen).  Also note the defrost symbol "hints"
on the left for levers A, B, & C, and on the right for lever D...

So for maximum defrost capability:
	- close fresh air intake (move levers A & B to the left)
	- just in case, direct fresh air to the footwells (move lever C
		to the left)
	- direct hot air to windscreen (move lever D to the right)
	- enable hot air (pull up on levers E)
	- choose fans speed on knob F, as appropriate

Also note the following caveats on the air outlet vents:
	- windscreen vent  - heated/fresh air
	- side dash vent   - heated/cooled air
	- center dash vent - cooled air
	- footwell vents   - heated/cooled/fresh air
