     Howdy, and I'm just now back to the 911 list.
     
     Recently, my girlfriend bought a 1989 911 Carrera with 65k miles on it 
     with my approval.  The engine has good leakdown numbers (between 4% 
     and 7% each) and runs strong.  It has a few places that leak (seep, 
     really) oil.  It doesn't leak enough to make drips on the ground, even 
     when hot and when left overnight.
     
     During the test drive, we saw no smoke and no drips on the ground.  
     The car had been checked out by Protechnik in Houston recently for 
     another buyer anyway.  Everything else on the car seems and still does 
     seem fine.
     
     The problem is that the car burns lots of oil.  It burns more than a 
     quart per tank of gas.  We noticed this on the way home from Houston 
     to Dallas.  It seems to burn more visibly at start up, but then the 
     visible smoke goes away.  On long trips, it consumes oil the whole way 
     but you can't see the smoke.
     
     Since then we have been looking into what could cause the high oil 
     consumption.  We have checked the external oil lines (none crimped or 
     showing wear).  The car is at Mayo Performance (Porsche) in Euless 
     right now.  They just re-did the leakdown test and the car passes just 
     fine.  The spark plugs looked fine but were replaced anyway.  They 
     also drained the crank case when the engine was hot to see if too much 
     oil was building up in there.  It drained just 2 quarts (expected). 
     Their best guess is a cracked oil ring (or some other oil ring 
     problem) that would not be detected with a leak down test.
     
     The only option I have heard is to take the engine apart and to try 
     and see that way what could be the problem.  However, I would really 
     like to hear other options that don't take some much time and money to 
     perform.  Is there any other way to diagnose what could be causing the 
     oil consumption?  Can valve guides be "checked" from the outside?
     
     Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
