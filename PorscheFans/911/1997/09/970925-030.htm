You can mount Carrera brakes on an early 911 by making an adapter.

Early 911s (through 68 model at least - the short wheelbase cars) had
what I call a 3 piece front strut:  (1) A ball joint in a forged holder which
was bolted into the end of the A arm,  (2) an intermediate forged spacer
incorporating the steering trailing arm, and (3) the strut tube with an
attached forged spindle and brake mounts.  The ball joint bolts to the
intermediate part, which is held by three bolts to the strut tube, forming a
stacked unit.  Parts (1) and (3) can be used interchangeably on either
side, while only the trailing arm parts are "sided" left and right.

Until the era of 4 piston brake calipers, Porsche used first small M
calipers and then larger S and A calipers, and then the Carrera 3.2
calipers up front.  M calipers had a closer together bolt spacing for the
two attaching bolts, while all the others had the same bolt spacing, wider
and farther out from the axle.  So, leaving aside questions of centering
the caliper on whatever rotor you are using (which can be adjusted by
shimming, I think, to accept the Carrera caliper), the S, A, and Carrera
calipers are interchangeable.  

I don't know if there was a 3 piece early front strut made for the early S
cars which included the S caliper.  If so, one could just replace part (3) -
the main strut/axle assembly.    I do know that it is pretty easy for a
machinist to fabricate an uncomplicated adapter so that an S, A, or
Carrera caliper, or any aftermarket caliper which uses the same
mounting bolt spacing, can be used on the M caliper spacing early struts.
 These struts have four mounting ears, two on each side of the strut in
the fore and aft plane.  The front two are used to mount the calipers, the
rear two I believe mount the dust shields (those things we trackies
promptly discard), and they are symetrical because the same piece
performs these functions on both sides of the car.  A piece of suitably
thick aluminum stock can be machined so it fits over the axle stub and
bolts to these 4 mounting ears.  It, in turn, has two threaded holes
(perhaps with an insert for added strength) spaced suitably for mounting
the S/A/Carrera caliper.  If one were intent on the Carrera caliper (which
means the thicker and more expensive Carrera rotor, because the caliper
alone will give no advantage at all, will it?), then the adapter could be
made to place the mounting plane at the proper offset from the rotor
centerline plane.

I should qualify my view that this is not a big deal by revealing that the
roller 68 race car I purchased some while ago had this modification done
to it when I bought it.  My ventures into additional suspension/brake
modification and damage repair have made me intimately familiar with its
general form and function, as I have taken it off and reassembled it, but I
never had to make up shop drawings for a machinist.  However, trust me
- it is not a complicated piece.

It works fine - car was SCCA GT-3, I run it in club racing GTS4-R with a
hopped up 2.7 and Bremteks, and put some pretty substantial loads on
the adapter as a result, and it shows no signs of breaking or otherwise
being a problem.  When a spindle broke between the bearings, and I then
discovered that the forged collar to spindle part was cracked about 75%
through, I could discern no damage at all to the adapter (which, of
course, doesn't carry suspension loads, just braking), and just
remounted it on a replacement strut.

I do wonder why anyone with a street 911 not used frequently at
autocross/driver's ed or Club Race type events, with a basically stock
engine, would feel the need to add bigger brakes.  Not that they are
detrimental (other than perhaps adding a bit to unsprung weight), but
how many people have exceeded their brakes' capacity on the street by
roaring up to every stop sign and red light, and braking at the threshold
for 20 minutes at a stretch or more?  I suspect the factory went to the
Carrera rotors because the weight of the car had climbed by maybe 500
lbs from the more modest early cars.  And the 993s, at over 3000 lbs and
double the horsepower of many of the early cars, have even more
energy to dissipate.  But didn't the original design work well for its
purposes?  Do folks with solid rotor/M caliper Ts find they get brake fade
in daily driving use?
