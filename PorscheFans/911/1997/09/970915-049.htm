OK  here's a few:=20

1. There was the time my clutch pedal snapped off as I was pulling away =
from red light (opted for tow truck instead of gearbox damage ~ 50 miles =
from house).

2.  Blown fuel pump fuse - this one was only a couple of miles from =
house and my father helped me tow it to my house (never did tell him it =
was just a fuse and I had one in the glove box).

3.  Bad brushes in Alternator caused battery to go dead - by not =
charging it (turns out that bad brushes will not light up the idiot =
light on the dash, at least not with the French alternator - about the =
only thing the light is good for is telling you if the belt breaks). ~45 =
miles from house


Your problem sounds like fuel system contamination / clogged fuel filter =
/ I had a similar problem after changing a fuel filter one time =
apparently I contaminated the fuel pressure regulator ( I disassembled =
it and cleaned it < DO NOT ATTEMPT ).  A bad frequency valve can also do =
weird stuff, but  I don't believe a '75 has one.  Could also be a weak =
fuel pump i.e.. not enough fuel pressure to work good.  You might also =
want to look at the low voltage side of the ignition circuits (the crazy =
tach stuff might not have been the CD ignition but maybe the distributor =
magnetic sensor ???)

Oh well good luck - and keep that cyanide capsule handy.
