 I've got a couple of assorted questions for the list.  All apply to a =
1980 911SC.



1.  The sound pad in the engine compartment of my SC has finally =
deteriorated.  I have the new pad & adhesive.  Do I need to lower the =
engine to do this, or can I do it with the engine in place?  Any tips?



2.  The seal(s) on my sunroof are also shot.  I ordered new seals (front =
& rear) and some adhesive for that as well.  Any tips on this job?  Any =
special technique or tools for removing the old seals and installing the =
new ones.



3.  I have changed the oil a number of times, and have never replaced =
the washers on the drain plugs.  The reason is that everytime I order =
the washer set, they don't fit.  The ones on my plugs are aluminum =
looking and are fairly thick rings with a thin "sidewall" and fit =
perfectly.  The ones I keep getting are thin copper washers with a =
smaller opening and don't fit over the threads on my drain plugs.  What =
gives?  Everytime I order them, they tell me these are the right ones, =
but they never are.  Do I have some kind of non-original plugs?  They =
are both the same (tank & sump).



4.  I have a front mounted cooler in my car.  Is there a way to drain =
the oil from the cooler as well as the tank & sump?  It seems that with =
every change, there is always that couple or quarts of oil that can't be =
drained.  Even if I did it only once a year, at least then I would have =
a "complete" oil change and then "partial" changes in between.  Any =
thoughts?



5.  Anybody know the size and type of the socket needed to remove the =
bolts on the CV joints.  I haven't done this in a couple of years and =
when I did, I borrowed it from a friend.  If I remember correctly, it =
wasn't just an allen type, but a star configuration (or am I thinking of =
the flywheel?).



Ok, that's more than a couple.  Thanks in advance for any responses.
