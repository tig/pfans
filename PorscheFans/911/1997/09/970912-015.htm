Chris,

I'm in my early thirties and did much the same thing when I bought
my 993.  Read extensively, invested like a madman, sacrificed to the
Nth degree and I now have my dream car.  As I say to those around
me, how badly do you want it?

I'm always quick to acknowledge those driving any vehicle model made
in Zuffenhausen.  I must admit however, that I do turn a blind eye to
those benighted miscreants driving ill-handling Mustangs, Z28s, Trans
Ams, as well as irksome Japanese products attempting to goad me into
nonsensical street racing.  It happens at least once a day here in
Dallas.  Trust me...

Congratulations on the purchase of your 993 and a virtual wave to you
via the miracle of email!

Regards,

David W. Pancerz

  I too have experienced both good and bad encounters w/other Porsche owners
and dealers (Fortunately, mostly good).  I purchased a new 993 back in April.
I had been saving since I was 14 and technically should not be able to own an
$80K car based on my current income BUT I'd always wanted the car and when I
saw that Porsche was changing the car in 99, decided that I shouldn't wait any
longer. (BTW: My vanity plates say NO WATER)...
