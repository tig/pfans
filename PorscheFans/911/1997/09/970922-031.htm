Someone suggested a cotton car or and then plastic -don't think this is good.  But dessicnt is good idea - take it from one (myself) who had to clean A LOT of mold out of a 928S stored for 2 weeks under a good breathing car cover but sun roof was open a crak and waterooled and dripped in. 
I think best bet is tent structure that doesn't touch car and thus won't chaff paint and keep car sealed up with desacant bag- not expensive one from car mag but cheap one that you put i your basement.
Also although it doesn't snow much, snow and ice get on caver anthen when the wind blows this can damage paint as covermves on car.

If you must use cover(cheaper/ looks etc.) spring the bucks and get a good soft bethable cover.
