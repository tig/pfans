Because of the in-windshield antenna on my '88 Coupe, I can't mount mine
anywhere near the centerline of the car or neither AM or FM will come in
worth a damn.

What I have found works really well is to mount it to the left of the
steering wheel, about 5 inches above the dash and about 3 inches from
the left A pillar. If you do this, it will not sit flat horizontally and
still point straing ahead/back so you have to mount it kind of
cock-eyed. However, my measurements show that the rear "eyes" still can
see out the back just fine.

I also bought the optional remote display. This is a must have IMHO if
you drive at night. I use mine all the time. Here's how I mounted it:

I mounted the power supply jacks (the thing with the 2 RJ-11 jacks on it
that has the power leads) underneath the dash just to the left of and
forward of the ashtray. There's a flat bracket there that the velcro
sticks to nicely.  I then ran the RJ-11 wire for the remote through the
small gap between the steering wheel column and dash. I shortened the
wire (using a telephone repairmans kit) so it was just the right lenght
(you could also just coil  it up behind the dash). I mounted the remote
display via velcro on the 1" wide cowl that is at the base of the
steering column. Doing this places the remote display right below the
speedometer. 

I then run the coiled RJ-11 wire from the 2nd jack on the thing mounted
under the dash under and around the steering column up to the detector
which is stuck to the windshield with the suction cups.

One nice thing about this mounting location is that you don't have this
big box with a wire hanging down in the middle of your
windshield....blocking your view and obviously visible to others. When
it's off to the side it's much less noticable.

Via the wonders of digital photography and the web I've put 2 pictures
of my setup on my web site. See

the remote display is mounted and

mount the detector.
