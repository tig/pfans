PFans:
This weekend I did a little brake work on my 83SC.  It was fitted with
Hawk pads, High Performance Street.
Here's the quandry.  The rear pads were substantially more worn than the
fronts.  In fact, I replaced the rears and not the fronts.  How can this
be?  The laws of physics tell us all that the front brakes take the
brunt of the braking force...indeed, I have had cars with the rear pads
lasting through three sets of the fronts.
Is there a brake bias problem here?  Can I adjust that or is there a
part that needs renewed?

The car is used at the track and the brakes seem to work just fine (it
is essentially stock and will turn sub 2 minute times at MidOhio---which
is not shabby in my estimation, at least with me at the wheel.)

Any help or comments will be appreciated.

W. S. Cline
