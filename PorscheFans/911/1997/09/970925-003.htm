    Garth:

    Please reconsider... In the unlikely event that you crash hard
    enough to bang your face into the steering wheel or door, a
    full-face helmet will keep you looking pretty and save you the
    inconvenience of having to drink your meals through a straw
    while your jaw is wired shut after dental surgery.

    Full-face helmets will also help to keep the skin from melting
    off your face in the very unlikely event that you're in a fire.

    And... If you have a full-face helmet and a friend offers to let
    you drive his no-windshield 914 (or Formula Ford or Indy car or
    whatever), you'll be able to accept without worrying about how
    you'll keep your eyes open at 100 MPH.

    Is Mintex still around?  I don't know ANYONE who's using their
    pads.

    I VAGUELY recall that they made a real soft pad -- called #17,
    maybe?  I forget -- that worked well when cold, but was pretty
    worthless at high temperatures.

    If you can lock up the wheels by stomping on the brakes real
    hard, but your car doesn't stop quickly enough when you
    threshold-brake right at the edge of locking up the wheels, the
    only thing that'll make it stop quicker is a stickier tire... As
    I wrote a couple days ago, changing the brake pads won't improve
    your single-stop braking distance.

> Would upgrading my brake fluid help stopping at all?

    No... "Upgrading" brake fluid generally means replacing your
    fluid with one that has a higher boiling point; the higher-temp
    fluids are more resistant to fade, but they won't shorten your
    single-stop braking distance.

    That depends a little bit on how you define "better" (and on
    which Mintex compound you choose), but in general, the factory
    pads are pretty good.

    Yeah, more or less.

    The expensive parts of the tuneup are the valve adjustment and
    the carb adjustment, so you won't save very much by doing the
    other things yourself.  If it were me, I'd let the mechanic do
    the whole thing this time... If you really like getting your
    hands dirty, do your own oil changes between the 15,000-mile
    valve/carb adjustments.
