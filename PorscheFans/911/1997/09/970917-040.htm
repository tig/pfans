God, I hope not!  Things like this get lynch mobs going at PCA events.

In seriousness, if you want to participate iin PCA events such as autocrosses
and concours, and they are using the Parade Competition rules, I don't think
you can compete in a regular class.  If you're bringing the bomb out to a
race track driver's education, that's up to the region putting on the event;
they
collect the money & govern the rules.

I don't think you will be drummed out of PCA membership for this; National 
should still accept your greenbacks, since the only thing you have to tell 
them is Porsche year & model, not engine type when subscribing.

By the way, is he converting the V-8 to air-cooled, or puting in a
Rolls-Royce
grill in the trunk lid (a la VW Bug body kits)  to accomodate the radiator?

What people will do to save money!  Also, what does he expect to get for the 
car when he finally sells it?  I think it will be significantly devalued.

(reply to:)

I'm looking for information on changing out a 2.7 in a 1977 911 to a
small block LT1 chevy. A friend of mine is looking to make this change
and needs info from people who have made this change. 
 He is making this change because he is lookig at replacing the current
2.7 with a 3.0 for $4,500.00 or get the Chevy for $1,800.00 including
the install kit. He will use the same trans and gearbox. Will his car
still be accepted in the PCA?
