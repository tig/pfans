Frank,

I have an '81SC with the same problem.  I have seen instructions to pull =
the relay itself and clean the contacts, etc., but my problem is in the =
wiper switch.

Try this:  Turn the wipers on.  Then hold the stalk (press LIGHTLY =
forward) and turn them off.  If I do this, my wipers will park.  Also, =
if I press the stalk forward slightly while they are off, my =
intermittents will work as well.  At the moment I can jiggle the stalk =
and get the lot to work (till I hit another bump), and am planning on =
pulling the stalk out and cleaning the contacts in the switch (maybe =
next week).  I'll let you know if this works.

Subject: wiper problem

I'm having a few problems with the windshield wipers on my 79 SC. First
of all, the wipers will not park on their own. The motor works fine at
the various speeds but when you turn them off, they stop wherever they
are at the time. Is the parking mechanism a series of contacts at the
end of the wiper motor like on most cars I've seen? Second, the
intermittent function doesn't work at all. Turn the knob and nothing
happens. Is this generally the knob or the relay? Any info would be
greatly appreciated.
