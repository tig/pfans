I too had a similar experience with the seatbelt/airbag light.  When  
the Bosch Hammer was hooked up a high resistance fault for the right 
crash sensor was stored in the computer.  Cleaning the connections and 
clearing the fault fixed it.  I'm not sure if this is a latching fault, 
ie. it won't go away if the problem goes away.  IMHO it is worthwile to 
have the Hammer hooked up everyone once in a while as there can be lots 
of fault codes stored in there.  For example, I found out the climate 
control sensor blower was not working.  $125 fixed that (BTW a Nippon 
Denso blower!).

When I first purchased my car it was I took it into a local independent 
for a service.  What I didn't realize was that the Bosch DME on these 
cars has a proprietary interface and the mechanics Sun diagnostic 
computer can't talk to it so he couldn't reset the seatbel light nor 
could he do a system adaptation.  I ended up going to the local dealer 
for this.  What left a bad taste in my mouth was that since I asked for 
two procedures to be done (reset seatbelt light and perform system 
adaptation) I was charged the book time for each separately.  I was 
charged over two hours (excuse me, time units) of labor and the car was 
in the technician's hands for about 20 minutes.

If several of us went together the cost of a Bosch Hammer might be 
reasonable.  Sounds like a candidate  for a local PCA region to 
purchase and rent out.  Any of you EE/CS types out there know anything 
about the DME interface?  Any possibility of building an interface 
board and writing some software for a PC?  I'll volunteer to do the software.

Hey Phans,
I've got some interesting questions I was hoping someone might be able
to answer.
1.  I would like to entirely replace my brake fluid (Castrol GLMA) with ATE
Super Blue.  On the newer Porsche's, however, one needs a handheld
computer to release the solenoid/hydraulic valve to bleed the integrated
clutch/brake hydraulic system.  Is there any other way to do this?  With
car started, clutch pedal depressed, right pinky finger in left ear, etc.???
I would like to do this regularly, but cannot due to difficulty/expense of
having dealer perform the job.

2.  I have seen and ordered the ATE SuperBlue fluid, but recently noted
that ATE makes two kinds of brake fluid.  Both have the same boiling
temp, but one is DOT 3-4 approved.  Does this mean anything to me in a
street car setup, or should Super Blue only be used for racing
applications with SS brake lines?

3.  The other day, after car sat in garage for a week, both my Seatbelt
and Airbag warning lights came on and stayed on.  My mechanic says
this may be due to some collision sensors near each front shock tower
and that again, he needs to look at the problem with a hand held
computer.  I'd normally break down and buy this gadget, but at $2500,
maybe I can wait a bit.  Any ideas?
Any help would be appreciated.  ChrisK. '90 Carerra 2, Polar
