                      CLASSIC  CAR  BILL  HITS  OVERDRIVE
                                        
        
        SACRAMENTO--  Senator Quentin L. Kopp ( I-San Francisco/San 
        Mateo) announced today that his Senate Bill 42, which would 
        exempt from the biennial smog check requirement all vehicles 25 
        or more model years old, passed the Assembly on September 9, 
        1997 on a vote of 75-2.  The legislation now returns to the 
        Senate for a final vote to concur in Assembly amendments.
        
             "It is extremely gratifying to have gained the overwhelming 
        approval of the Assembly, while the passage serves as a 
        testament to the tireless efforts of classic car owners 
        throughout the state in support of SB 42," Kopp stated.  "I 
        expect that the Senate will affirm its earlier unanimous support  
        of the bill in the pending vote on concurrence in Assembly 
        amendments," he added.
        
             Kopp described SB 42 as a simple measure which would 
        provide a welcome measure of relief to owners of classic cars 
        and similarly-aged vehicles.  Upon becoming effective January 1, 
        1998, the bill would exempt all 1973 and older vehicles from the 
        biennial and change of ownership smog check requirements.  Kopp 
        said that the smog check exemption for such vehicles would 
        address numerous concerns of vehicle owners, including that 
        finding the original parts necessary to pass the visual and 
        functional aspects of the test procedure had become daunting, if 
        not impossible, in some cases, and cost prohibitive in many more 
        instances.
        
             "Thousands and thousands of car enthusiasts have backed SB 
        42 from its inception and their unrelenting work on behalf of 
        the bill has kept the measure in the legislative fast lane," 
        Kopp remarked.  "The breadth and depth of support for SB 42 is 
        unparalleled and I trust that the groundswell will be equally 
        impressive to the Governor as he considers his action on the 
        bill," he concluded.
