I hope the following website article brings some objectivity to the K&N vs.
"other filters" debate. I'd like to think of myself as having an open mind
about things, so I went surfing for unbiased opinions concerning air filters.
Here's what I got from this Toyota MR2 web site. BTW, lots of decent
information here besides this air filter article:

<Subj:  K & N filters                    
<To:  John M.  Saturday, January 21, 1995 5:14:10 PM
<From:  George Morrison

<John:  If I wrote "subjective" I meant "objective"..  I was responsible for
evaluating re-<usable air filters for a major construction/mining company
that had hundreds of vehicles <ranging from large earthmovers to pick-up
trucks and salesmen's cars.  This studywas <embarked upon due to the fact
that we were spending upwards of $30,000 a MONTH on <paper air filters.
 Using them one time then throwing them away..  I inititated the study in
<that I was convinced that a K&N type filter or oiled foam would save us many
dollars< <per year in filter savings, man hour savings, and of course engines
as these would filter <dirt better than paper. (yes, I had read the K&N ads
and was a believer)

<Representative test units were chosen to give us a broad spectrum from cars
right through <large front end loaders.  With each unit we had a long history
of oil analysis records so <that changes would be trackable.

<Unfortunately, for me, every single unit having alternative re-usable air
cleaners showed <an immediate large jump in silicon (dirt) levels with
corresponding major increases in <wear metals.  In one extreme case, a  unit
with a primary and secondary air cleaner, the <secondary (small paper
element) clogged before even one day's test  run could be <completed. This
particular unit had a Cummins V-12 engine that had paper/paper one <one bank
and K&N/paper on the other bank; two completely independent induction
<systems.  The conditions were EXACTLY duplicated for each bank yet the K&N
allowed so <much dirt to pass through that the small filter became clogged
before lunch.  The same <outcome occured with oiled foams on this unit.

<We discontinued the tests on the large pieces almost immediately but
continued with <service trucks, formen's vehicles, and my own company car.
Analysis results continued <showing markedly increased wear rates for all the
vehicles, mine included.  Test <concluded, switched back to paper/glass and
all vehicles showed reduction back to near <original levels of both wear
metals and dirt.  I continued with the K&N on my company <car out of
stubborness and at 85,000 miles the Chevy 305 V-8 wheezed its last breath.
 The <top end was sanded badly; bottom end was just fine.  End of test.

<I must stress that EVERYONE involved in this testwas hoping that alternative
filters <would work as everyone was sick about pulling out a perfectly good
$85 air cleaner and <throwing 4 of them away each week per machine...  

<So, I strongly suggest that depending upon an individual's long term plan
for their <vehicles they simply run an oil analysis at least once to see that
the K&N or whatever <alternative air filter is indeed working IN THAT
APPLICATION...  It depends on a <person's priorities. If you want performance
then indeed the K&N is the way to go but at <what cost???

<And no, I do not work for a paper or glass air filter manufacturing company
nor do I have <any affiliation with anything directly or indirectly that
could benefit George Morrison as a <result..  

I hope this adds valuable information to everybodys decision-making databank.
