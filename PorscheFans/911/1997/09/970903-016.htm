I screwed up. I really don't have archives. What I have is a email address on
a free email site called juno.com. I do most of my computer activity on AOL
now that it has a fixed monthly rate. Everytime I get a email (and I
subscribe to the individual email format rather than daily digests-which
wouldn't work) from Porschefans that I think I can use or possibly will use,
I send it over to Juno. Then every once and a while, I get on Juno and get my
mail. On Juno, you have the ability to make broad directory type folders and
I have done some catagorization of the Porschefans email by car system; i.e.
suspension, engine, etc. Keep in mind that there really isn't that much I can
do with a car-having been an accountant all my life-I only save the ones that
are fairly easy technically. At any rate, when I have saved a email in Juno,
It's fairly easy to look them up and access them.
