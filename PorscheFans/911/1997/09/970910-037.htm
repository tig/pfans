Toyo actually is a fairly established tire mfg.  They came as OE on my 
Nissan 300 back in '89, as well as a Mitsu Eclipse of the same vintage. 
 They also have an R-compound tire to compete with the BFG R1; I think it's 
called the Toyo Proxes F1?  They've also sponsored the local BMW club 
races, with a set of, you guess it, Toyo racing tires for the winner.

They're a long term outfit.

I'm seriously looking at the Toyo FZ4.  I'd never heard of
Toyo tires before but am told that they're the #2 company
in Japan and have been in the US for 10 years.  I'm leary
of a noname tire but for $125 mounted and balanced, I
think I'll give 'em a try.  I just hope they're still around when
I need to buy another set of rear tires.  There's always a
risk, I guess.
