pfans,

**** Much deleted:

This thread is losing whatever entertainment value it had
at the beginning IMHO.  But since we're on the subject:

True, owning a Porsche does not identify me as intelligent, caring,
literate, socially responsible, etc.  It is no judge of my moral or
ethical behavior.

However, in my case, my choice of cars does say something about me
(and not much of it is flattering :)

For example:  What genetic disorder is responsible for people like me
who can afford newer cars, but insist on driving older, less
practical/safe/reliable.... cars for the pure hell of it?

Beats me, but it is a symptom of the fact that I'm the type of person
who will not always take the safe path, will not always do the
reasonable thing.

Sometimes passion wins out over reason.  If this were not true
than there would be no market for sports cars (or internet startups :)

And true, I have no obligation to talk to anyone who wants to talk to me
about my car.  Just as Charles Barkley(sp?) claims he has no
obligation to be a role model.

But people usually want to talk to me about the fact that
it's old and appears to have aged gracefully.
They think it's cool that another old sports car has survived the wars
lives to tell the story.

Some are wankers and I find a way to move on.  But talking to me at
a gas station is a lot different than talking to a guy at a National
Competition event.

YMMV,

Vol
