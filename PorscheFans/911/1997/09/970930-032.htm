I have a '79 911SC that has a problem where sometimes, after high-revving,
fast-cornering driving, much of the oil apparently collects in the engine
sump, causing lower oil pressure, high oil temp, a labored idle and
noticeable engine drag ( possibly because the crank is splashing oil around
).  Turning off the engine for a few minutes seems to be the only good
solution to get it back into shape.

I have heard that this is a documented problem and there is a
factory-designed fix available for purchase.

Does anyone have any experience or details on this phenomenon, the
solution, and how to obtain it?

Best Regards,
Jim Sandahl
