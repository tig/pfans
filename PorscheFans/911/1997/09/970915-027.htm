I am sending this to you all as an example of the worthiness of your opinions 
to Pete Wilson.

On the 4th I sent an email doc to Gov. Pete Wilson requesting (with supportive 
reasoning) his backing on the pass of SB42.

I am still not sure of where he stands, but can assure you all that he is 
reading email.
I received a reply today.   And I don't even live in CA.  I live in NYC!!!!

Please do your best to email the governor, and have your friends do it to!!!!

He seems to be listening, and if there's enough haste, then our efforts may 
not be a waste.

That's why I appreciate you bringing your comments and concerns to the
attention of my office.

Be assured that your thoughts will receive the necessary attention by members

I am unable to respond to each electronic mail message individually;
however, for a personalized response, you may write, phone or fax me at
the following:

Again, thanks for taking the time to write.  I appreciate hearing from
you and I hope you will continue to actively engage in the public
policy debate as we chart California's course into the 21st century.

Sincerely,


PETE WILSON

         Dear Mr. Clardy:
         
         	Thank you for your e-mail regarding SB 42.  Your support 
         is much appreciated.
         
         	SB 42 was approved by the State Senate today, 36-1.  
         Senator Tom Hayden was the one lone no vote.  Last week, the 
         Assembly Appropriations Committee adopted amendments to SB 42 
         which freeze the 25-year and older smog check exemption for five 
         years, at which time the exemption becomes a rolling, 30-year 
         exemption.  In other words, the bill moves the current 1965 
         exemption year cutoff forward to 1973 and maintains that 
         exemption year until 2003.  The amendments were promulgated by 
         the committee.  Obviously, I prefer the previous version of the 
         bill.  Notwithstanding the committee amendments, passage of the 
         bill represents a substantial victory.
         
         	Please continue to convey your worthy support to 
         Governor Pete Wilson and urge him to sign SB 42 into law. The 
         Governor's e-mail address is www.gov.ca.gov  
         You may leave a phone message at 916-445-2841.
         Or, you may FAX him at 916-445-4633. 
         
         					Sincerely yours,
         
         					QUENTIN L. KOPP

p.s. Just think when this passes you won't be hearing SB42 from me anymore
:-)
