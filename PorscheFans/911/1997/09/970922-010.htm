Pnuts!

I have purchased a set of 3 pi3ce wheels for my 89 911 - that is stock. The 
wheels appear to be too wide based on the my driveway test fit.

I purchased the wheels based on the Suggestion from a Wheel Expert in SF!

	Stock		Suggested/Purchased
205.55.16 205.50.17	F
225.50.16	255.40.17	R


They looked too wide to me, so before I purchased & mounted the tires, I 
jacked up the rear, pulled the
Stock wheel and tire and dry mounted just the rims.......the inside rear wheel 
flange came within 1/4" of the upper oil line and 3/8" from the adjusting nut 
on the trailing arm. The wheels also protruded past the wheel fender edge a 
full inch.   I'm no expert, but tires are wider than wheels and I think they 
will rub or look like I boned a honda!.

The wheel seller says the the rear axel hangs down when jacked up and when 
everything is mounted up, this combination works without anything rubbing.

DAMIFINO.............anyone got any advice before I send these wheels back?

What is the suggested wheel size combo if you want to stay stock with 17" 
wheels?

Thanks in advance 

Bill
