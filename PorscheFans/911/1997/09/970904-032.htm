listen you porsche nuts I'm getting all your e-mail replys in my e-mail box
at aol. forward this to the genious in charge of your e-mail server. Look at
the path at the bottom of this e-mail and figure out why I'm getting about 50
of your e-mails everyday. I'm blocking all e-mail from anything with porsche
in it and I'm sure your fellow nuts are getting pissed because they are not
getting there reply's

Thankyou

Mark Hald also asks if you have to remove the whole front strut to
replace a shock.  You don't have to take the whole strut off, and I doubt
anyone ever does just to change a shock.  basically, if you can get the
bottom of the strut down low enough, after you take the nut off in the
luggage compartment which holds the top on, you can pull things down,
compress the shock/strut rod, and swing the top of all this out of your
fender well so you can take out the old shock and put the new in.  I
suggest you loosen/tighten the "nut" which holds the shock into the strut
with the dust cover off but the top of the shock reinserted into its hole in
the top of the fender well - you really have to crank on it, and you will
have trouble doing this if the assembly is too free to flop around.  Points
to consider:  1) how to hold everything when you are
tightening/loosening the big nut, and 2) not putting a strain on the brake
line, as it will be sort of holding this assembly up, and it is not made for
such use.  Doubtless this is why Haynes (which is simply cribbed from
the factory manual) says take it all off.  but these problems are overcome
all the time by shade tree mechanics and real ones too.  Dave Ferguson
taught me this once at the track - been using it ever since when the need
(seldom, thankfully) arises..

A post by your humble servant which touches on this is at 8/27/97 under
"Loose Front End."  I don't know if that helped BloombergP any.
