<< 
 The other gripe is (on the the 993 at least) the dipstick has to navigate 
 this bend in the holding tube, to go from a horizontal tube at my end to I 
 assume a vertical tube at the oil tank end. So it rubs against the tube and 
 any oil clinging to the inside, smearing oil over most of the dipstick and 
 making a true oil level reading pretty impossible.

Bob:

Those who have given "advice" on the dipstick reading have likely never tried
to "accurately" read the "miserable"  twisted yardstick that comes out of a
993.  Prior 911's that I've owned were a snap to read (hot, level, and
idling) with the short straight dipstick in the oil tank neck.  Further,
every prior 911 I've owned with the oil level guage would at least start to
register at the mid-level point on the guage if the tank was nearly full
(dipstick reading) and the car was "warm" and running on the road at
2500-3000 rpm.  Not so the 993...it barely "bounces" above the Red area
unless the car is within 1 quart of full.

I'd ignore the advice from "the straight stick crowd" (:)) except for the
suggestion to slowly add oil until the dash level guage reaches the mid-level
( 3 o'clock) position (and yes, yes, yes,....."warm, level, and idle
stabilized).

Too bad they didn't just put an access panel in the rear seat area for a
"straight shot" dipstick... (the only "plus" is you're not likely to drop the
dipstick in the tank as some have!)
