I appreciate your advice regarding the mounting of my sub strap, but
I do not appreciate the tone of your response.

Like I have previously mentioned, I am new to all of this and I am not just
learning about driving, but I am also learning about prepping my car for
time trials.  This is not the first time that I have made a mistake with my
installation, but this is the first time that I have been called NUTS.
-----------------------------
First time huh? Hmmm, we've got a cherry on our hands here... I'll try to
be gentle 8^) Well, get used to it! (I did, so I can tell you it's not that
hard). Just lighten up! Did you rather hear "not too smart"? Come on! Heck
as far as I'm concerned we're all nuts, why else drive a P-car?
If I had to start complaining every time someone calls me nuts, an idiot or
worse, I wouldn't have enough time to show up for work (Hmmm… that's an
idea)
I get the feeling that ever since we had the serious flames on the GRP mess
two months ago a lot of people on the list got grumpy or scared or
something. When ever someone's corrected or gets well ment critics he/she
feels offended or P-ed off and seems to start an argument (or flaming).
What's wrong with you people, there used to be some laughter on this list…

Well, I hope I crushed some big ego's today, big time. Feel free to flame
away, that will  tell us enough about yours 8^)
Have a nice day 'yall.

Jeroen - The Netherlands
Completly NUTS & loving it!

PS To whoever posted about the Porsche 4x4 SUV (or SUC) a couple of day's
ago, I laughed my ass off. Keep it up!
