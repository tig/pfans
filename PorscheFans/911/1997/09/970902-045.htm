I picked up a '96 C2 last weekend and was surprised by the recommendation in 
the manual of 15,000 mile oil changes for mineral or synthetic oil. That 
seems far too long to me. What are you 993 owners doing? I was thinking of 
doing 5000 with Mobil 1.

I believe that GM recommends 3000 miles with Mobil 1for the Corvette. How 
can two engines have such different oil change requirements? Try to keep the 
Corvette jokes to a minimum, unless they are really good.

Porsche has recommended the 15,000 mile oil change interval for a number of
years now, even before they started using synthetic oils. They started in
August 1992 shipping all cars with SAE 5W - 40 synthetic oil. The 1979 911
Warranty & Maintenance Manual recommends a 15,000/24,000 km oil change
interval. They go on to say to provide good lubrication and to keep the
engine internally clean, the oil should be change and the filter replaced
regularly (at least once a year), so this is not a new recommendation.
