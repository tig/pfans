At my last AutoX event I managed to get the front right tire to rub on the
inside fender well of my '87 coupe.  It rubbed at the rear of the tire,
from about the 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock position.  Strange that this occurred
while turning very sharply right, so at the time this was the unweighted wheel.

My question is has anyone adjusted their steering/suspension/offsets to deal
with this problem?  I've got stock suspension, lowered but not extremely so,
and 6x16 205/55 wheel/tires.  I wanted to upgrade to 7x16 225/50 in the front,
but heard that some cars fit better than others.  Perhaps mine is one which
won't tolerate the larger tires?

I was thinking about checking to be sure my steering is centered.  Could
nonsymmetric adjustment of the tie rods be a problem here?

Thanks very much for any experience you can share.

Cheers,

- Brad
