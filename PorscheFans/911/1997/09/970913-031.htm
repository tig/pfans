The mating connector is (normally) attached to an adjustable strap that
fits into the seat glide tunnel. This strap goes all the way through to the
back where it is attached to a stainless clip that clips to the back of the
glide. If yours are missing it means that your PO probably 1) could not
figure out how they worked or 2) did not think them important. You now know
the importance.
