Now I'm at the point of being tired of having the red lights on all the =
time and, rather than disconnect them, I'd like to replace the pressure =
switch. My question to the P-Fans is: Where the heck is the switch? =
Having once replaced the oil temp sensor, I know which one it's NOT. I =
believe the other one near the temp sensor is the pressure gauge sensor. =
A look in my Haynes manual seems to indicate it may be located forward, =
to the right (passenger) side of the flywheel near a thermostat. My car =
is an '84 Carrera, and I cannot see the area to confirm location. My =
assumption is that I MAY be able to get at the switch if I remove some =
items from the top of the engine. Before I begin, I was hoping to obtain =
some helpful hints. PLEASE don't tell me this requires engine removal! =
Well, if you tell me that, please be gentle ...  ;^)
============================

Mark, just disd my injector seals in my 84 Carrera. Here's what I wrote to 
a friend... Might be a good time to do your inj seals and IM gaskets. I 
think I saw the switch right next to thermostat. You'll have to get at least 
the rt manifold out. You will need the gaskets and inj seals since they need
to come out... Here's what I did:

Yeah, just like that... It was not really that bad. Just remove the
A/C comp, big black plastic hose from left with fan. Remove dist cap to
allow for better access. THen undo the 12 bolts holding IM. Loosen rubber
conn. bet manif halfs. Loosen fuel lines and fuel rails. Injector rails
lift right up. Undo rt manif. Plug head holes with paper. Then undo left
Manif. Undo accel ret spring under manif and accl connector. There will
be enough clearance to lift and be able to remove old gaskets and spacers.

Use vacuum cleaner to suck up gasket material while scrapping old gasket.
Replace gaskets and spacers. Put everything back. Lube injector seals
with trans fluid. Pop them right in. Attach bolts, gas lines, etc.
Put air filter/air meter back, check for clamp tightness, etc...

Took me two nights. Total of about 7 hrs to do. Car seems more responsive now
I only tested it from house to corner. Need to do a longer test...:)
Found a lot of crud by where the injectors fit. I was getting air bypassing
the inj seals. All unmetered air, diluting my mixture. 
	
Hope this help!

Lou
