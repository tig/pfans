Nil--

It's a long "box" for lack of a better term that the seat glide is attached
to (it may even be the glide itself, I haven't been down there in a while).
Anyway, the strap is pushed into this tunnel until it appears out the back.
The strap has a stainless steel or chrome clip on the end not unlike a
money clip, so there is an idea. The clip is wide and gets a good grip at
the end. Then you clip the plastic pieces together and tighten the strap
under the mat and voila! snappy dressed foot mats that do not move.

When I bought my mats and dumped the goodies out of the box, there was a
long rectangular piece of thick plastic that I almost tossed. I soon
discovered that it was a "tool" included with the mats to push the strap
and clip down through the tunnel. Anyway, you should be able to rig
something up. The hard part will be finding a mating connector for the
plastic end and the hiking store is a good place to start. If you are a PMP
owner, you have no use for your money clip so use it on the "tunnel" end ;-)
