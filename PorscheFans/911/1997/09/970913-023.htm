On yanking out my aftermarket floormats to give them a thrashing, I noted
the following:

(1)  The mats have kevlar buckles on the underside that obviously want to
mate with something, so they don't slide around.  I can't see any likely
candidates, or even an obviously place to loop something around the seat
frame.  It would be nice, as the driver's side tends to slide forward and
bunch up.  Ideas?

(2)  On the right side of what I'll call the transmission tunnel, just
below the console and just even with the shift lever, there is a bolted-in
square metal plate with a round threaded hole that looks to be about 7mm or
so.  What is this for?

As long as I was down there, I pulled off the A/C deflector.  It sure
doesn't look like it would have impeded airflow much at all, but I guess it
can't hurt to have it off.
