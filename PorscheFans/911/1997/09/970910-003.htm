Howdy,

Perhaps the only "reasonably" priced change you can make is to install SSI heat
exchangers and an early exhaust muffler ( stock ). The next step would probably
be to put Webers ( 40 IDA  or 46 IDA - the debate continues as to which works
best ) on the car. From then on its standard hot rod tricks such as cams,
pistons, head work, etc. all of which add up very fast $$$. Some would suggest
going to a 3.2l before going this far. I'm a bad example though as my 81SC has
an early exhaust, ported Mechanical fuel injection, Cosworth pistons, Head
work(ported and HD springs by AAse), S-cams, and twin plugs on the 3.0l case
$$$$$. Sure works good though at about 240 hp.

As stated before, Bruce Anderson's book is a goo reference. Hope this helps a
little.
