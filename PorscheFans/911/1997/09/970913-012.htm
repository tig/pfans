Henk Scholling--
	I have a 1981 SC which did something similar several years ago. It was a cold 
start enrichment problem, which was solved with a new warm up valve. The valve 
can be adjusted by someone who knows how to do it, but my mechanic just 
replaced it. The valve, as I recall, is on the left side of the engine block, 
near the back. You can see iut if you look there. It has a fuel injector line 
going to the injection distributor. Follow the line to find it. The valve has 
a bi-metallic temperature sensor in it that gets out of adjustment and sticks, 
causing mixture problems. You should also put a flapper valve in the air box 
so as not to damage this when you do backfire, that is common with SC's.  Good 
Luck. Warren C.
