My 911SC is always very twitchy (rear end move around a lot, feels like
it'll easily break free) for a few thousand miles if I replace just the
rears.  Basically you are riding on new, soft, full-height tread blocks
back there... and old, hard, half-height blocks in front... the two sets
of tires have pretty different side-force-vs-slip-angle
characteristics.  Back when a good weekend featured 300 miles of back
roads, this used to bug me enough to replace all four tires at once. 
Nowadays I do the rears when the fronts are halfway down, and drive on
tiptoes for a few weeks.  Never auto-x'd in this condition so I can't
tell you what the actual effect is on ultimate traction, but I agree
that the "twitchy" feeling IS un-nerving...
