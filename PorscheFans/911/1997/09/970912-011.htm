Hello again Porschephiles!  
(ooops, I mean PorscheFans :)  

Thought I'd give you my yearly update on my Porsches.  The '77 930 was
completed back in March (bright yellow with chrome '94-style wheels and '94
body kit) and looks sharp!  It is a dead ringer for a '94 Turbo.  It still
runs great except that the turbo is belching oil and needs replacing, and I
don't have insurance on it right now (four speeding tickets on my record).
So it mostly sits except for an occasional romp around the block.

Also, I've picked up a red '81 924 with the 5 lug disc brake option (with
forged 928 style wheels) for $900 about three months ago.  It has a bad
transmission and some fuel injection problems and has sat for about 3
years.  It's slowly coming to life.  My daily driver is still a '90 VW
Corrado G60, a German car with no problems...imagine that!

Are any of you tired of those road hogging sport utility vehicles (SUVs)
that EVERYONE seems to be driving these days and are running our P-cars off
the highway?  My freind and I are so fed up with these pretender beasts
that we've started a website about it.  As far as I know it is the only
anti-SUV site on the web, and it has some semi-useful, semi-funny stuff on
it.  Check it out at:

Let me know what you think of it and tell me anything I can add to it.
Also, are any of my old P-fans freinds still on here?  Let me know what's
happening with your rides.  Later,

Jay Karolyi
