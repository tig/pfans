> As an owner of an '85 911 Coupe with almost 60K on the clock, I can say
> that my car has absolutely zero rust underneath or on the body panels.  I
> live in Buffalo (yeah, yeah it snows a lot here) and I know the car has
> been in the Northeast since its birth.  However, I don't think it's seen
> any winters and won't as long as I own it.
> 
> I could imagine if the car you are considering had some substantial stone
> chips or scratches down to the bare metal that went untouched, rust could
> develop especially if the car is driven in the winter.  If you have rust
> spots that are coming through from the inside I would be very surprised
as
> these 'newer' Porsches are galvanized and seem to hold rust off very
well.

> Good luck...
