I'll re-iterate my response to your original question.  BTW, sorry for not
reading the first part of your original question correctly regarding the 
address of the PODS.

You DO NOT have to drill.  Unfortunately, I found that out too late and
drilled two holes total.  One on the passenger side tunnel for the passenger
inner lap belt and one on the driver side for the driver side inner lap belt.
I later found out that Brian Lee was clever enough to figure out how to 
attach the inner belts to the inner rear seat bolts and he got away with
no drilling and is 100% reversible.

Also, you don't want to replace the OEM belts, you leave those in for road
or auto-x use.
