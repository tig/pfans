Thanks to Dave Cooley, Terry Shugart, and Harley Myler for the input.  Found the problem last
night.  It was a vacuum leak.  Fixed that and the idle is now where it should be (900 RPM) and
solid as a rock.

Good thing it wasn't the mixture or idle speed adjustment, as the Haynes manual states
"Adjustments to the fuel injection system require the use of expensive equipment not readily
available to the home mechanic.  It is therefore recommended that these fine adjustments be
carried out by a Porsche dealer or competent repair shop."

Didn't I buy the Haynes manual to learn how to do it myself ?!?!  I guess that its time to cough up
the bucks for the real manuals.  I didn't want to pay full retail.  Any used sets out there for sale?

Terry,  I'd like to know how you managed this "expensive equipment" situation when you
rebuilt your CIS.
