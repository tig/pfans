Henk,

Believe what you will.   A spark plug lights the fire.   That is all.
If it takes an expensive special plug to light the fire, then something
else is wrong.   The ONLY thing one plug can do over another is
light it more reliably.    If it is lighting the fire more reliably then either
there was something wrong with the other plugs, or there is STILL 
something degraded in the fuel spray pattern from the injectors.

>Hello Porschefans,
>Yesterday I looked at the warming-up problem and replaced the
>spark-plugs
>on my '80 911 sc usa spec's.
>First I wanted to replace the Bosch w5dc for platinum ones,since they
>last longer and it's a pain to change the plugs so I went to the shop
>for 
>some of those.They didn't have the specific model,but the guys at the
>shop said they had a new spark-plug with 4 neg.electrodes,whitch will 
>give a possible 8-way spark.It's also from Bosch and is called the Bosch 
>Super 4.The folder said the benefits are a smoother drive,better
>acceleration and mpg,and a better cold start,and absolutely save for the
>catalystic-converter.For my car 3.0 sc from 77-83 with usa-specs the
>right one was the w56.When I took one out of the box,they looked like
>the 
>Golden Lodge spark-plugs used on every Alfa Romeo with a Boxer engine.
>So I bought the Super 4's  and installed them.
>I made a test-drive last night with the car and I was impressed.
>Smoother idle,and better acceleration from 60-140 km.Feels like i'm
>having extra horsepower all of a sudden.....
>Idon't know if they sell them already in the Usa,but here in Europe they
>just started selling them.Price was normal,about $5 or 6 dollars a
>piece.Hope this is not sounding like an ad for Bosch,but I'm convinced
>they work.
