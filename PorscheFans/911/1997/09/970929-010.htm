Mark A. Kressley is trying to use a vacuum retard distributor with his
carbureted engine.  He tells us that just tapping a vacuum port into one
intake manifold section produced excessive vacuum pulsations.  I
suggested (among other things) that he put two 0.040 restrictors about
3" apart in his vacuum line to damp out these pulsations.  

Naturally, Mark wants more info on how to do this.  Well, I am a bit foggy
on details.  The reason I know the precise sounding measurements given
above is I remembered when I got home and looked them up in my engine
notebook, where I carefully kept articles torn out of European Car
(perhaps before it used that name) and Dune Buggies and Hot Vws,
concerning the Cagle vacuum adjustable fuel pressure regulator, which
was being marketed in the early 90s.  I used some ordinary vacuum line
size tubing from my tubing junk box.  I tapped in with a small barbed
fitting, though I can't remember if it was a 1/8th IPT fitting, or maybe a
1/16th. I don't think I have a 1/16th IPT tap, though.  The line was the size,
more or less, which fits onto a distributor vacuum tubular fitting (although
I wasn't attaching it to a distributor).  I cut the line in two places to install
the restrictors, and used plastic barbed hose joiners of the appropriate
size for the tubing to reconnect things.  I pressed the restrictors into
these hose barbs.  I can't recall just what I used for the restrictors -
maybe a short piece of brass tube filled with solder and drilled, or just
plastic.  Something I could do with a pin vise or a Dremel, as I have no
lathe or mill.  I have a set of carburetor jet reamers, so may have used
the smallest of those to bring a small hole up to the specified size.  So
kluge somehing together and see if it works.  As you have figured out,
you have nothing to lose at this point, since you have (I guess) empirical
proof that one port vacuum with an ordinary line won't do what is
needed for you (lousy idle?) due to pulsations, and it sounds like
manifolds are on engine in car and you don't want to pull them to add
more vacuum ports.

I am still hoping someone with knowledge of factory carbureted cars will
chime in and a) confirm my suspicion that the factory never used a
vacuum portion to its centrifugal distributors on its carbureted cars (or its
MFI cars?), or b) explain how they (or the factory) produced the
requisite vacuum signal for a distributor from a carbureted setup which
did not have vacuum ports built into it.  Mark obviously was able to obtain
a distributor with a vacuum pot on it.  I came onto the Porsche scene
with a CIS engine, wife's 3.2 has the DME to control things, and my
Webers are on race engines with crankfire ignition, so other than my one
bright suggestion I am not the guy to give him the best practical advice.
