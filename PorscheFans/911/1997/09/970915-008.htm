Vann,

The oil change on a 3.2 Carrera is very simple.  Drain the oil tank in the
left rear fender (bolt on bottom) into a large EMPTY pan.  This is where
the largest amount of oil will drain and it does drain quickly!  Drain the
crankcase as well, you will probably need a separate pan.  I've just spoken
with a very reputable Porsche mechanic up here (used to work for Porsche in
their race department).  He said synthetic oil isn't necessary in your car.
 He suggested the bearing tolerances weren't designed for that kind of oil
and that you'd just be wasting you $$$ for the synthetic.  He suggested
that a REGULAR oil change was more important than the use of synthetics. 
His suggestions was to NEVER put synthetic in the transmission.  

I use synthetic myself because I believe in it and I can appreciate its
strengths under my driving conditions. I don't mind spending the extra
dollars for it, since I always stock up and buy it on sale!

Joe
