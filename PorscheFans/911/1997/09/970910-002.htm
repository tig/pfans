PFans: I've got a bit of a dilema regarding the wheels and tires on my
'88 Carrera. 

First, some facts to lay the groundwork:

Starting in the '87 model year 15" Fuchs (7" front, 8" rear) were
standard equipment. The tire size was 195/65 front, and 215/60 rear.
Apparently most '87s and '88s were ordered with the optional 16" Fuchs
(6" 205/55 front, 7" 225/50 rear). In '89 standard equipment was 6x16"
(205/55) front and 8x16" (225/50) rear (apparently 15" wheels were
dropped all together). 

My car came with the standard 15" setup. When I bought the car the
dealer installed new Bridgestone RE 71 (205/55 VR15 front, 225/50 VR15
rear) tires because 10 year old tires are unsafe (the tires were
basically new, the car had only 6800 miles on it). Thus my car has 15"
wheels with a lower profile than the standard equipment (side wall
height of 4.43" v. 5.08").

According to the excellent online tire comparison application at
http://www.gpsgroup.com/motorsports/tiresize.htm the smaller diameter
should cause my speedometer to read about 5% fast (when going 60mph it
should read about 63mph). My measurements (timing mile markers at
various indicated speeds) it appears that my speedomoeter reads 11-12%
fast. In other words, with the standard sized tires my speedo would
still read about 6-7% fast. 

Now for the dilema: I have no problem figuring out how fast I'm really
going while I'm driving. The problem is that my car is collecting
"virtual" miles. Every 1000 physical miles I drive results on an extra
~110 miles on the odometer. Because my car has such low milage (I'm
about to hit 11000) the effect is much more dramatic and it *really*
bugs me.

I believe I have 4 options for fixing this:

1) Keep my current wheel/tire setup and get the speedometer adjusted.
This will cost around $400.

2) Buy a set of standard equipment sized tires for my current wheels. If
I do this, the speedometer will still read about 6-7% fast. So I'll
still get the speedo adjusted. Total cost ~$1000.

3) Buy a set of refurbished 16" wheels (~$2000) and tires (~$700). If I
put the standard size tires on (205/55 VR16 front and 255/50 VR16 rear)
my calculations show that I'll still need to get the speedo adjusted
(the tires will still cause a 1% inaccuracy in the speedo plus the
built-in 6-7%). Total cost ~$3100. I'd keep my current 15" wheels &
tires for autocrossing & other track events.

Another factor is my car has not been lowered and I want to lower it to
European specs. This will involve an alignment after the lowering. 

Option #2 is pretty much out of the question because I really like the
performance characteristics and look of the lower profile tires. So my
options are really #1 and #3. With #3 I get tires that are about 1"
larger in diameter (24.86" for the 16" wheels/tires v. 23.86" for what I
have now). This will result in a +.5" ride hight difference. 

So now for my questions:

1) Will a change in tire diameter affect the alignment at all? In other
words, should I wait to lower the car if I think I'm going to get bigger
wheels?

2) Is there any advantage to having the larger diameter wheels/tires?
Any disadvantage? Why did most people order these cars with the larger
wheels? One advantage to having a smaller diameter that I see is that
the suspension does not need to be lowered as far to get to european
spec hight, reducing the potential for problems associated with
over-lowering.

3) If I do get new wheels, why shouldn't I get the '89 setup (8x16" v.
7x16" in the rear)? I know the 8" wheels are more expensive, but will
they fit my car? 

4) What *is* european spec height? I remember hearing that it's measured
from the fender. What us US spec height?
