Is there a physical test to determine if the diff is open or limited slip?
Is there a marking or something to indicate which factory diff on a '94 964
911 is the LSD on a normally aspirated 3.6?
I would imagine that just putting one rear tyre on a slick surface (wet
grass) and the other on the track would exhibit a clear difference.
The mechanics of most any diff mean that 100% of the rotation of the drive
shaft is distributed to the rear wheels.  Thus if the rear of the car is
off the ground, a gear is engaged and the engine is not running, then
rotating either rear wheel will cause the other wheel to turn in the
opposite direction.  This test would be true for LSD's or open diffs.
I can't think of a reliable test (other than the crude acceleration test I
described above) that will work.

Please advise.
