Hi P-fans,

I have a 93 C2 and the car has been having a slight idle problem for the past
year (just read someone else's e-mail regarding a similar problem).

During the last winter, I noticed that the car's idling would fluctuate upon
cold starts.  If I turn on the A/C, the engine would struggle for a few
seconds and quit.  After 10~20 minutes of continuous driving with the A/C
off, the car would idle normally.  During an April time trial in San Deigo,
the car simply quit idling.  I was able to drive the car home (with many
re-starts at stop lights), and the car was able to idle again the next day.
 Somedays this problem is worse and somedays better.  I have swaped the idle
control module with another C2 and found that wasn't the problem.  I also
briefly checked the hoses for possible vaccum leaks, but didn't find any.

This morning the car stopped idling again, @#$*#!!!!!!.  I am planning to
attend an event in Willow Spring in two weeks.  Does anyone have any advice?
 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated as well.

Thanks in advance.
