I'll second this... I was an auto-x courseworker one day when someone
ran a V8-powered 914.  It was a little scary... the thing I remember
thinking as we all scampered several steps further away from the track
was "loose cannon -- lit fuse"... wondering which way the thing was
going to go when the wheels finally hooked up.  And this was a MID
engined car with an ALUMINUM V8... I'd hazard to guess that a REAR
engined 911 with an IRON V8 would be pretty close to uncontrollable
anywhere above first gear.

The air-cooled boxer motor is at least half of the 911 experience
(IMNSHO)... if you can't afford it... buy something else!  There are
lots of fun cars in the world...
