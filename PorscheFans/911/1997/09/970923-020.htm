Hi Bob -

I'm a rookie driver in both GGR/PCA and POC clubs.  I've spent this summer
comming up through the teaching programs with both clubs.  With this recent
experience, I might be able to offer another perspective to this discussion.

1)  I thought autocross was kind of dumb.  Bunch of cones in a parking lot.
Not for me!  I need a real track!  WRONG.  Autocross is big fun, and aside from
being careful about hitting course workers, completely carefree.  My first big
shock was how poor a driver I was.  Come into a sweeping corner a little too
fast and you just head for the brakes, right?  Nope.  Big spin follows.  Then
comes the announcer over the loudspeaker with a choice remark or two, and
everyone laughs.  Big fun.  Plus you start to gain experience.  As one
instructor put it, you've got to build the instincts on car control into
the pit of your stomach so that when you get into a situation at speed near
Jersey barriers you don't have to think about what to do - just do it.  Plus,
perhaps the best thing about autocrosses in our region is spending the day
with great people and great cars.

2)  Even after a summer of autocross, lots of studying texts, and a slalom
event with POC at their Streets of Willow track, I still thought the safety
equipment was a little excessive.  But playing by their rules had gotten me
a lot of fun, so I followed the rules, set up my car, and went to my first
time trial at Thunderhill.  That's supposed to be the safest track - good place
to start.  The experience was unbelieveably intense, even though I drove
pretty conservatively.  The highlight was a ride in the red (fastest) run
group.
That's where I learned why we have the safety equipment!  HOLY S...!!  You
won't believe what our Porsches can do.  YOU SIMPLY CANNOT IMAGINE this without
experiencing it firsthand.  Suddenly it all becomes clear, and the rules make
sense.  (And you're also a hooked fish ;-)  With a stock belt you couldn't keep
your butt in the seat, much less operate the steering wheel.  I had no clue.

So fork out the cash, set up your car, and come out and play with us.  If you
still think the harnesses are silly after riding with an instructor like I did,
then I'll buy YOU a beer!

Cheers,

- Brad

PS:  Although you have to shave your mustache if you don't want to wear a
head sock, they do allow you to keep your eyebrows! (Sorry, couldn't resist ;-)
