Really, six wrecks per weekend?  You must

You missed the point the comment, by henry watts, was referencing the other

the GGR time trial series.

WE do run a safe event.


The emphasis in Driver's Ed. is properly placed more on

Yep, that what it is all about.

That is why there is a ground school prior to the race day activities.

How often on this list do we

>for the first time and got sideways on a off ramp?

These guys wouldn't do drivers ed  anyway as they know all
