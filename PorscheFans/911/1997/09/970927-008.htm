Greetings,=20

Several months ago, a post was made (many thanks to Doug Dutton) =
regarding the removal of the front bumper and replacement of the "smile" =
or "mustache" seal.  As an inexperienced but not mechanically =
disadvantaged owner, I thought a few additional points might save =
someone trying this job a great deal of hassle. =20

First, get the right tools.  The obvious include jack stands, anti-seize =
for putting the wheels back on, ratchet set, and a good work light.  Two =
other tools will really help:  1.) A clip puller.  It will make removing =
the front bumper strip quick and easy.  I found mine at Pep Boys in the =
upholstery section for $8.00.  2.)  The other is a flexible drive =
screwdriver / ratchet, .025 inch drive.  I did not have one but I have =
seen them at Sears and in the Snap-On catalog.  This tool alone could =
reduce the total time for the job to under 90 minutes.

To get the bumper off, -in addition to the 4 bumper mounting bolts- you =
must remove four sheet metal screws inside each wheel well.  These =
screws hold the bumper extension in place.  This is the body part =
between the rubber bellows and the wheel opening.  After these screws =
are removed, the bumper should slide right off.  The flexible =
screwdriver / socket driver will be helpful here.  Also, it was helpful =
on my '82 SC to remove the mounting bolt on the driver's side that =
positions the lower valance.

Once the bumper is ready to come off, remember that there are washers =
and pads between the bumper and impact absorbers, PLUS wires to the =
sidelights and plumbing to the headlight washers in there. Proceed =
slowly and note the location of as much as possible.  There are several =
screws holding the smile seal in place that are tough to get to and this =
is where the flexible screwdriver is valuable, for both removal of the =
old one and installation of the new one.

I had 2 "got ya's" on the job.  1.)  Make sure all wires to the lights =
are hooked correctly and that they work before you reassemble =
everything.  2.)  The leading edge metal support on the bellows was not =
positioned properly as I started to reassemble and I gouged the valence. =
 That is why I found it easier and safer to remove the valance =
positioning bolt.  A helper for this part would also be useful.

The end result really improves the appearance of my coupe.  This should =
be an easy afternoon project even for a beginner.  Hope this is helpful =
to anyone contemplating doing this themselves.
