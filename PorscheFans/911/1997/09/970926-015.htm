Pfans:
Given the recent threads regarding trans rebuilding I thought I'd pass
along some details on my current 915 rework. This was what I'd call an
IRAN as in inspect and repair as necessary.  In my case this was 1-4
synchro rings, dog teeth for 3rd & 4th and a shift fork for 3rd and 4th
and the obvious seals and gaskets.  Total with outside labor to remove
and install the dog teeth came a bit under $500.  On tools. You will
need the following.  27mm 6 point socket (1 1/16 works fine), 36mm 6
point deep socket, Old clutch disk, metal strapping to secure the disk,
breaker bar, pipe wrench or another way to remove the 41mm nut from the
drive shaft and a section of pipe for added leverage.  Large snap ring
pliers (for at least 3 inch snap rings).  A solid piece of 4x4 and equal
lengths of 2x4's and blocks if you're going to hand press the gears on
and off the shafts because you don't have access to a press (I don't).
I used a generic engine stand with the trans mounted to a piece of 3/4
inch ply as an adapter.  I reversed the old clutch disk and bolted the
metal strapping from the disk (mine was spring centered so it had holes)
to one of the bolts holding the transmission to the adapter so that the
direction of rotation to remove the castellated nut from the main shaft
pulls on the strap.  Disassembly was right out of the manual (Haynes or
factory) with the exception of removing the detents from both 1-2 and
3-4 so I didn't disturb the original fork alignment.  Un fun things are
the snap rings.  I ended up wiring the new synchro ring for 1st closed
so the ring would stay seated while I installed the snap ring.  Total
time for both disassembly and assembly looks like it will be about 6
hrs.  I still need to install and align the forks (waiting for overnight
special order) and have been told by a couple of people that you can do
it (carefully) without the alignment jig.  I'll see if I'm happy with
that. Thanks goes to Jerry Pellergino of EPE that hosted a tech session
on the 915 this past spring and Chris Bennett (fellow Pfan) who
organized it with Jerry.  I had a fine time getting greasy and eating
pizza with Chris and his NH buddies.  If anybody wants anymore detail
let me know.
