I don't recall anyone doing a study of this, but from what I can recall,
the 911 temp gauge that went with the "s" instrument package in the
early 70s was the same one as in my '75.  At least that's the one I
know, so I'll start there--it goes from 120F to 300F, with intermediate
markings at 180 (about 1/4 way up), 210 (about 2/5 way up), and 250
(about 2/3 way up).  That was the beginning of the hot-running cars with
thermal reactors added to the magnesium cases, and to allay fears
Porsche changed calibration in '76 to go to a max of 330!  The other
stupid idea in '76 was the five-blade fan.

What I frankly don't know is whether the unmarked gauge reflects the
300- or 330-degree calibration.  I suspect the former, so you can use
the  above approximation as your guide--that is, when the needle is out
of the cold zone it's at 180, and when it's 2/3 up but not yet at the
red it's 250.  Or you can order a calibrated gauge from North Hollywood
Speedometer, who'd certainly know which one to send you based on your
year car.

My other car, a '90 Cherokee, also has a calibrated temp gauge, and 210
is the normal operating temp for that car.  With some modifications, the
engine in my Porsche usually runs 180-210 and rarely exceeds 220, so I
consider myself fortunate.  The originally-equipped engine
self-destructed in '86 at 66K.  Rarely you'll see a '75-'77 for sale
with very low original miles, but bear in mind the above figure as the
expected life unless you do something that's not quite cricket.

For California listers, I take it SB 42 is still alive, although I'll be
an old man by the time it does me any good.  I keep my fingers crossed
meanwhile.....

instance, has gotten much briefer.  Wagner's 'Ring Cycle' takes four
days to perform while 'Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm' by the Crash Test Dummies lasts
little more than three minutes."  --P.J. O'Rourke
