Gunther:

Yes, it's possible... But it's a WHOLE LOT easier if the cam is still 
in the engine, since you can then measure valve lift and duration 
directly.

Cam the three grinds you mentioned be differentiated solely on the
basis of cam DURATION?  If so, it should be pretty easy to tell
which cam you have, even with the cam out of the engine:  To measure
duration, just find the points on the cam lobe where its shape
deviates from a circle, then measure the included angle between
those two points.

If you have to measure lift, it gets more involved... Direct readings
with a dial gauge don't necessarily correspond to the actual lift
that the cam will impart to the valve.

If you need to measure the SHAPE of the lift curve, (like, for
instance, if you're racing your car and trying to determine whether
your cam is legal for its class), it gets much more involved... To do
it accurately, you need to take into account the size of the lifter
(a larger-radius lifter foot will flatten the lift curve a bit,
increasing the area under the curve) and valve inertia and valvetrain
flex (both of which tend to slow the rise of the curve at the start
of lift).
