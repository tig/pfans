Oh God, doesn't anyone have anything NICE to say about the car?!?!  I mean,
I realize there is so much hate in the air over the 996, but COME ON, this
is the last and utmost of the real 911s! (Until they produce some signature
edition Carrera in '98)  Be honest, if the $150k price wasn't there to
compare directly with the TT's $100k price tag, then noone would be
ridiculing the "S".  

Imagine the 'regular' TT didn't exist.  At $150k, the S is STILL One-Hundred
Thousand Dollars CHEAPER than a Diablo, or even a 456GTA (reasonable
comparisons?), and, what?, THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS CHEAPER than
the Ferrari F50, the nest closest performer.  

That said,  the S is STILL cheap, and can outperform all these cars, as well
as having the luxury of all that interior work to go with it.

And what do you mean by "real drivers car" and something that isn't "all
show and no go" (or whatever the S was misrepresented as)? Just get a Twin
Turbo, strip out the seats, leather, carpet, stereo, dash, multilink
suspension, 4 wheel drive, 3.6L TT engine, ABS5, G64 tranny, exterior
enhancements, and 18" wheels.  Where does that leave you?  1971.  Will it
perform and function like the great 993?  Hell no!  Funny how noone
complained when the Nine-Five-Nine showed up years ago.

My money's on the table--I'd like to see you sit in, ride in, or DRIVE one
and not crack a smile...
