Sorry, SC doesn't stand for "Club Sport"...

SC - Super Carrera - made from 1978 through 1983
RS - Renn Sport - made in the early 70's and again with the 964/993 body styles

911 Club Sport - made in 1988 and maybe 1989
(IIRC, there supposedly was also either a 944 or 928 Club Sport...)
	deleted: rear seats, electric windows, interior trim, glove box,
		undercoating and sound insulation.
	standard: spoilers and sport shocks
	there weren't any significant engine modifications
