I think I may be in a similar boat.  The drain plugs on my oil tank and on
the sump cover aren't the same.  Everyone says they should be.  I am
always given the 2 aluminum sealing rings, but I now have these things
laying everywhere because they only fit the sump drain - the oil tank drain
plug is much bigger.  I even measured the tank drain plug and armed
with these dimensions attempted to find the proper sealing ring at my
local pcar shop - they were stumped.  Nothing to fit it.  The tank doesn't
appear to have been messed with (no signs of some past thread-
stripping repair).  The tank drain plug has some sort of large aluminum
washer that was tubular at one time - now its been mashed so severely
that it doesn't seal anymore.

Just for the heck of it, I made a gasket for it and pitched the aluminum
ring.

So far, so good.
