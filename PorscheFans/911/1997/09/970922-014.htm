PFans:

I finally found a mechanic I'm comfortable with here in Southwest Florida.
He did quite a bit of work for me all of which has my car performing better.
I do have one problem: He removed my catalytic converter and replaced it
with a straight pipe which has made the car a far better driver but after
the second day when I pulled up to a stop sign I saw some smoke coming from
the left rear of the car. I got out and looked and it appeared to be coming
generally from the left side of the engine but not through the tailpipe, so
I thought I had an oil leak that was dripping on something hot. This smoking
subsided significantly and now I occasionally see some blue smoke coming
from the tail pipe. Though this smoke emission is very infrequent I do
frequently get a smell of burning oil, but not always. The mechanic searched
and searched for an oil leak but found none. He thinks I either have a bad
oil ring or worn valve guide. The car is a 1987 and I have seen on the
digest that these are susceptible to worn valve guides. He thinks the reason
we have not seen smoke or smelled oil before was that the catalytic
converter was successfully dealing with the symptoms. I have had so much
major work to the car which involved oil changes that I have been unable to
accurately judge oil consumption but my initial impression is that the car
is not using much oil. Can anybody shed some light on this situation or make
some suggestions.

In response to Joe Sommers remarks about a stiff clutch in his '87, I too
have had a new clutch with the service bulletin done on my car and the
clutch contiunues to be on the stiff side with an unusually high release
point that makes it feel as if the pressure plate is worn. Can anyone
comment on this?

TIA
