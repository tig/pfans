P-Fans:

Sincere thanks to those who responded on the list and directly
regarding my post a couple weeks back.  My 911S Targa died just
past Carbondale, and was towed by AAA to Midstate Motors in "old" Snowmass. I knew there were just a few Porsches frequenting the Aspen area, but 
since I was just up from Denver for the weekend didn't have a whole lot of time to do research before the car broke down.  The locals all recommemded "that guy at the Conoco station," which turned out to be great advice! 
I had to leave the car, get a rental, and take a greyhound back up the hill
later in the week when they were done. Bill Welcher was very helpful, and
competent.  Turned out to be a combination of things:  The air/fuel had been adjusted to the rich side, which seemed to help the newly rebuilt 2.7 run better in Denver but was probably causing some plug fowling at the higher altitude.  Also, the points were contaminated by grunge that had managed to get up inside the distributor.  (Many of the posts back from P-fans advised me to clean the points first).  

Made it down the hill just fine.  I do plan to get my old Permatune CD box back from my local mechanic, since (in hindsight) it probably was fine and it'll be good to have as a backup.  Anyone know of a way to test those things?  Also, I plan to replace the points with the magnetic "Ignitor" 
replacement from Automotion.  Any comments on this product?
