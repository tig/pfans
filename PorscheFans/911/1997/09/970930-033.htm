Your story rings a bell...

I remember ordering Webers etc. for my 914 from a place in Florida called
Mid-Engineering in the summer of 1988.  Paid VISA, carburators still
haven't showed up.  I've moved to Finland, the car is still in Canada, and
Mid-Engineering is not in Florida (or anyplace else i know of).  If I had
any idea where these crooks are today, I'd be there with a baseball bat (or
a hockey stick ;^)   ).

still waiting for a $1000 package, albeit a little older and smarter now.
