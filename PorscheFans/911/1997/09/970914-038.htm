Street 356 Porsches were designated 'A', 'B', and 'C' models, I assume
because 'A' comes first in the alphabet, etc.  Engine designations prior to
the 'C' model were 'normal'(60hp), 'super'(75hp), and 'super 90'(guess how
many hp).  With the 'C' model appearing in late 1963, the car's brakes were
changed to 4-wheel discs, and the 'normal' engine disappeared.  The standard
'C' engine was the 75hp version, and the "top-o-the-line" was the
'SC'-"super" C-with 95hp, the most powerful stock pushrod engine Porsche had
made.  The 356 vintage Carreras were NOT designated "SC".  I have NO idea
about the meaning of SC when connected to a 911.

> A while back the list had a string going on the meaing of the SC in
>356SC and 911SC.  Does anyone still have it, or remember its content?
>If I recall, no one came up with an authoritative answer.
>Does anyone know what the SC really means?
