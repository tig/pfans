Greetings,
I bet this subject has been beaten to death but without a searchable archive, 
I'm lost to find the answers  (hint, hint).  

I'd appreciate hearing from others regarding problems with the a/c on their
911s.  I've had an '86 coupe since new and here's a summary of my
a/c repairs:
-- Compressor replaced twice and it's still leaking oil
-- System will *not* hold a charge; recharge interval is about 4 mos max.
-- System changed to R134a last year.  Works fine when it's freshly
   charged and costs less to recharge.

The a/c system has been the single highest maintenance item on the car.

Does every 911 have a/c problems?
Are there any fixes??  Different compressor?  Tricks?

It's headed back to the Porsche dealer this week for a second recharge
of the season.  Sure would like to fix this problem once and for all!!

Thanks much,
           Alan Olson
