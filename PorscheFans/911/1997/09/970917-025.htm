    Bill:

    This is a load of crap.

    I'm hesitant to even dignify it with a rebuttal, but here goes,
    anyway.

    Platinum conducts heat only about 1/6 as well as copper.

    "Null grounding induced by the platinum"?  What does THAT mean?

    If the idea is that platinum is a better electrical conductor
    than copper, it's wrong... Platinum is about ten times more
    resistive than copper.

    A "base metal" is one which reacts easily with oxygen, as
    opposed to a chemically-inert "noble metal" like platinum or
    gold.  The metal's "baseness" has essentially NOTHING to do with
    its suitability for use as a spark-plug washer.

> An added benifit is supposed to be better flame propigation.

    The benefit, if any, would come from the indexing of the spark
    plug; the material used for the washer wouldn't affect that.

    P.S.  And another thing... Sparkplug heat ranges are determined 
          under the assumption that you'll be using one new copper
          washer.  Using anything else (even a stack of COPPER
          washers) changes that assumption and may force you to
          change your sparkplugs to compensate.
