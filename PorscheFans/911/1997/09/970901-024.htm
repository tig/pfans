P-Fans.....Just installed a B&B muffler on my '88 along with their
stainless CAT replacement pipe.  In my eagerness to hear the music I hit
the road for a 20 mile loop.  The car ran great! Sounded even better.
Upon my return I realized I failed to hook the O2 sensor back up.  After
rectifying this I hit the road again only to realize that the faint
stumble just off idle as you roll the throttle on in gear was back.
Disconnected the sensor, stumble gone. It's very subtle but there, as
before, with the sensor connected.  The only downside I can detect with
the sensor disconnected is a mild burble on deceleration. This is
smoother with the sensor connected.  My question is why is this
happening? And what changes are going on with the ignition/fuel mapping
when the sensor is disconnected?  I'm assuming the air-fuel ratio is
modified by the O2 sensor.  Any damage to running without it? Where
could the stumble be coming from?  Car has 41K on it and has had a full
30K service. Your observations would be appreciated!
