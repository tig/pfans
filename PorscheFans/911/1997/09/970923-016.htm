Ross,  
I had a thunking the last time my son and I drove up to TWS to watch the
club race.
It started during large bumps in the road and progressed to smaller
ones.

It was the fan under the little flap door under the front bonnet.   The
mount was going
bad and allowed the fan blades to contact the side of the housing.
There is also a 
relay in that same area,  it may have come loose.

I limped home with the fan speed on Hi (not a problem when it was 97) ,
the faster speed
kept the fan centered better.

In any case I would peek under the flap, the only moving parts there is
the fan and the 
sound would come through to the interior very easily.

Good luck
