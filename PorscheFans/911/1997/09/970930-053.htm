After my 901 transmission realigned and it's front mainsahft bearing,
syncros and first-reverse shift sleeve were replaced, regular 75/90 gear
oil was used during the break-in period. Then I switched to RedLine
75W-90 synthetic. The transmission works well in all weather. Unless I'm
speed shifting up (as decribed earlier in this thread) the syncros work
fine.

I think the friction of the 901 syncronizer rings is not overcome by the
properties of the synthetic gear oil. I do think the lower friction and
higher stability of the synthetic oil will make life easier for my
twenty-six year old transmission.
