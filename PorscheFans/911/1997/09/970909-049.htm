Dal/PFans,

What you have sounds a lot like the the "clogged injector" problem I 
experienced with my '77 Carrera 3.0 (essentially a 911SC built a year 
before the SC hit the states).  I also went the fuel filter, drain tank, 
fuel injector purge route, but my problem would sometimes come back.

The most annoying symptom was with it would begin to run worse the more I 
applied the throttle.  It actually ran better with less throttle.  On one 
particularly bad trip, this continued until it would hardly pull at all, 
and I would pull over.   That's when I first tried the procedure below:

Here's what I did that would give my car immediate relief --  Remove the 
injectors by pulling them out of the manifold (near the bottom of the 
intake runners by the cylinder heads/cam towers).  They have a thick 
rubber O-ring that will sometimes stay in the manifold, if so, pry out 
with a small screwdriver.  You can test the injector by pointing it into 
a clear bottle, and trying to start the car.  You can observe the spray 
pattern.  Most likely you'll find it wants to make streams of fuel (or if 
it's really bad it will just drip!).  You may want to do this with each 
injector before moving to the next step.

Unscrew the injector line (I don't remember the wrench size, but you need 
two of them!).  Remove any O-ring that might have stayed on the 
injectors, and place the injectors into a small jar of something like 
"Gumout Fuel Injector Cleaner"  Normally designed to go in the gas tank, 
I've found the injectors will get better if I soak them in this for a few 
minutes (10 - 30 usually).  Make sure the fluid goes down the inside of 
the injectors (ie pour it into them slowly), and that the tip is 
"soaking" in fluid.

Remove the injectors from the fluid, and tap them (connector end down) on 
a clean paper towel or napkin that is over a hard surface (wood, metal, 
etc).  You will probably observe black flakes that come from the injector 
and end up on the towel.   Rinse with injector cleaner and repeat if you 
have lots of flakes.

Install the O-rings onto the injectors (if you have any that are cracked 
you should get new ones from the dealer/mail order).  Reinstall the 
injectors.  You might want to recheck the spray pattern, but I'm sure 
you'll find your car runs great after this procedure.

This was so simple to do and it would make such a difference in how our 
car ran, that I would do it at the track during time trial weekends.  
After we switched gas stations, and I did this procedure probably a 6 
times, I never seem to have the problem any more.  I never did replace 
the injectors in my car, although this would have cured the problem, I 
would have been  missed the opportunity to "fix" the car, which I always 
find rewarding. 

I also tried putting the injectors into a ultrasonic cleaner (filled with 
injector cleaner).  This would also clean out the flakes in the 
injectors.  I know there are folks that offer this as a service, I can 
get you some names if you wish.
