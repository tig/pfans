I'm not tired of them either.  My '87 4Runner (just getting broken in
with 132,000 miles) is the perfect parts/people hauler.  I can put
a whole set of tires & wheels in the back to get mounted and not
have to worry about theft or the weather.  Visibility is great while
driving, it's easy to pack for trips (plenty of room), hauls 4 people
comfortably and it will go places "normal" vehicles can't (I use my
vehicles for their intended purpose - I don't have 4WD because
it's "trendy").

Heck, I'm even thinking of doing some mods to the thing to
make it into a tow vehicle...anybody ever towed a 911 with a
4 cyl Toyota??

And speaking of pcar etiquette, someone mentioned mild
disdain towards the Mustang/Z28 crowd.  On that note, our
PCA Region often has cars of this ilk show up to our track
events.  The interesting thing is that more often than not, they
succumb to mechanical problems before the day is out.  This
has only served to reinforce my opinion that these things
really weren't made for the rigors of track driving like pcars.


Just an observation...
