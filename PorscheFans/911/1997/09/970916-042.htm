6 months ago while having some work done on my '75 I decided to have my
wrench put in the new chain tensioners.  He told me that these things
are indestructable and will last forever with out failure..(he did his 7
year apprenticship at the porsche plant in Germany)  I got the car
sounded great then 26 miles later all hell broke loose.  Yup the part
that does not break broke.  No damage thank goodness and the wrench
stood behind the work and the part. They do come out of the box bad.

BTW the replacement has turned 6000 mi with no sign of problem

Terry, In fact it ran OK for a short while - no noise - then started 
making a racket....it's a sound you never want to hear. I should 
know in the next day or two what the damage (physical/financial) is. 
And then I'll post to the group so others contemplating the tensioner 
upgrade can learn from this.
