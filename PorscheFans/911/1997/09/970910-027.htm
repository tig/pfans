If any of you remember my saga of having the local Porsche dealership
repair my car...then you will appreciate this.  After the dealership
turned a Valve adjustment into a 1700 dollar bill (500 was brakes, which
I had to have Midas bleed), and informing me that I had a broken head
stud (after I purchased a new O2 control unit), I decided to take the
car to another shop to have the head bolt repaired.  While we were
taking out the engine, the mechanic noticed that the O2 sensor was not
even hooked up. Ouch---what should I do....I have written a letter to
the dealership and copied PCNA.  Should I demand the old O2 unit back
for testing,  if they have it...Or should I just demand my money back
and give them the part?  I guess I am probably just out some money and
have learned a lesson.  Any comments are appreciated.
