Many thanks for all the tips and suggestions that definitely helped me
through
my mini-vac disaster. As it turned out, the nozzle that I was trying to fish
out of
the airbox eventually got nudged into the #2 intake manifold. I started by
removing
the #1 manifold and when I couldn't find the nozzle with a probe I decided to
continue
removing manifold pipes until I got some results. Fortunately I "struck
nozzle" on the
second try. I really appreciated the moral support from this group. It was
sure an ugly
feeling when I watched that nozzle fall into the airbox. You guys salvaged my
weekend (my wife said she was glad she was at work when it happened). The
pop-off
valve is in place and reassembly with new gaskets begins.
Thanks again,
Larry Bafia
