I have an interesting problem.  Am interested if anyone has a quick fix.  My
83 911SC (90K miles exactly) has run great for the 3 yrs I've owned it.  It
was running great the other day, I stopped and got gas, then took it home and
washed it.  When I started it to put it in the garage, it started hard, ran
rough, and barely made it into the garage.  I left it alone for 3 days, then
the next time I tried to start it, it started, ran for 2 seconds, and quit.
 DId this over and over for 4-5 tries, same thing, then finally it wouldn't
start at all.  I tried it again the next day, and it started, but ran rough.
 I tried to take it around the block, and it barely made it up the hill.  It
got a little better, and I then got some fuel injector cleaner, thinking I
got bad gas.  That seems to have made a big difference, as car runs pretty
good now, but it still lacks power and I can sense it is not runnning as
smooth as it should at high revs.  A slight "wobble" to the engine.
 Acceleration is ok, but not what it was.  I have since topped it off with
fresh gasoline of a different brand.  Idle is still a tad low from where I
recall it being before any of this.  There is no water on the distrib, coil,
or plug wires -- engine is completely dry.  One other thing -- I guess the O2
sensor is supposed to light up every 30K miles.  This all happened RIGHT AT
90K miles on the nose.  I reset the O2 light, but that is surely PURE
coincidence.

I can't tell how much of the improvement is a result of  the gas, or if it
would have improved anyway.  Next stop -- fuel filter, which needs replaced
anyway, and then possibly the fuel pump (though I figured electric pumps
failed completely before they got weak).  Any thoughts on this one?  Thanks.
