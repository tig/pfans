Hi Pfans:

History: 1978 911 SC 88,000 miles, new oil temp gauge checked out with =
pyrometer,  replaced loop
cooler with  brass cooler,   Prior to these changes I ran 220 degrees at =
75 mph 85 degree outside
air temperature (OAT).

Last night OAT was 60 degrees the oil temp settled at 135 degrees for the=
 entire 2 hours at 3200 rpm
(75 mph true).  Is this so low I shouldn't drive the car?

To check the thermostat I felt the oil cooler at first start up and as =
the temp rose to 140 degrees
at which time it started to warm.  After driving for 1 hour the temp was =
at 175 after shut down and
a 1 hour wait upon restart the  temp leveled off at 135 in normal city =
driving.  This seems to me to
mean the thermostat did not close after the first drive.  How fast should=
 the thermostat close?=20

At 5600 rpm the oil temp toped out at 210 degrees oil pressure at 4 bar (=
 day time 75 OAT),  at 3200
rpm and oil temp 135 oil pressure is 3.9 ( night 60 OAT).

How long should it take for the car to warm up at highway speed? =20

What is the absolute lowest normal operating temperature?

Thanks in advance.
