Hank,
I purchased my cover from A.P.A Industries (they advertise in
Pano) a few years ago. A custom fit Evolution 4 cover is about
a $100 for a 911 at least.  The bag that it came with was
a joke as it was too small to put the cover in but other than 
that I've been satisfied. 
There number is 818 834-8473 (California)
