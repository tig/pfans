So, as I understand it, the SC was a parallel designation for what was
supposed to be the last evolutionary stage of the 911, just as it was
for the 356.

I agree that there is a connection with the earlier designation for the
356, but just where does the C come from in the 911 series if not the
Carrera?  in particular the 3.0 version known as Carrera in the model
line up which the SC replaced?

The S in the 356 series definitely stood for 'super'...as it did for the
911 in '67.
So, I stick to my guns on this until someone quotes from a truly
reliable source that SC means anything but Super Carrera....
and, I agree that SC was familiar to PFans in those days, but the
carryover from the 356 is not the whole answer.
