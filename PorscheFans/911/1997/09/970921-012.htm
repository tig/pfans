Subject: K7N Filters

<<I have seen some bad mouthing of K&N Air filters, and had to respond. K&N
is measurably superior to any foam air filter you can buy. You can have it
both ways! They out flow anything, including factory and foam filters. Anyone
who says they aren't as good because they flow better should take a course in
electrostatics, or at least go down to their basement and examine the
electrostatic filters they have in their furnace (if they are so lucky). Ask
your furnace shop if electrostatic filters are better.  I have used them for
years in every vehicle I own, including my 911 - and have seen many tests
done on them. I used them on my motorcycles and on a Baja Buggy that ran in
the desert. They are clearly superior. What is a bit more cost when they last
virtually forever. Of course, you will have to buy a can of the K&N filter
oil and clean the filter once in a while, but they come oiled ready to go and
you will notice a difference.>>

If you're referring to what I said about K&N's not flowing as good as foam
filters, you're mistaken. However, I did say you can't have it both ways. I
don't think a single filter type can be the best at both air flow and
filtering. And I don't think K&N's fit in that category. Maybe when they're
new, but that only lasts for a few miles until dust and dirt particles
accumulate. That's not a real world service situation. I think the only
scientific way to measure increased air flow gain (+HP) from just a filter
change is to test the engine/vehicle on a dyno. Check out
www.buschurracing.com/dyno for his dyno test on a 944 w/and w/o K&N's. Just
one person's experience.

BTW, what do electrostatic filters have to do with K&N's on a car? Yes, I
realize electrostatic home furnace filters are better than the $.79 filters
that your local hardware store sells. Are the K&N's electrostatically charged
filters? We're probably beating a dead horse here with personal and 2nd hand
testimonials. Perhaps one day an independent testing facility could put this
issue to rest.

Happy motoring
