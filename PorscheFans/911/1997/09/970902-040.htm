All,

A business associate of mine owns a 1995 993 C4 Cabriolet (Guards Red
with black top) and recently had the entire top replaced at our local
dealership (Town North Porsche).  In less than 3 months the rear plastic
window has turned from the normal clear color to an unsightly yellowish
tint.

Granted, we live in Dallas, Texas where 100 degree summers are the
norm.  The car is always garaged at night, yet left out in the sun
during the day without benefit of a sun shade placed in either the
front windshield or back.  No chemicals have come into contact with
the plastic window (Windex, Armor All, etc...) nor has the car been
battered by an automated car wash.  Questions are:

1.  Has anyone ever experienced this discoloration after so short a
    time?

2.  Can just the window be replaced?

3.  If so, is a replacement covered under warranty?

4.  Is there any way to clean the plastic to bring it back to
    its pristine shape?

5.  Other than using a car cover, are there suggestions on how to
    prevent this from happening again (assuming Porsche installs
    a new rear window/entire top)?


Regards,

David W. Pancerz
