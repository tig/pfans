A couple of easy (for someone, I hope) questions:

1)  What is the difference between the Bosch O2 sensor I can buy at the local
parts store for $20 and the "Lambda sensor" sold by Automotion and others for
$100 or more?  Parts store tells me this $20 model is the one designated for
an 83 911SC.

2)  On the CIS system on my 83 SC, there is something called a decceleration
valve.  What does this thing do?  A couple of years ago, the local shop
adjusted my idle and plugged the vacuum line to this thing, noting that it
was "slow".  How important can it be if it can be disconnected with no
result?  Or, should they not have disconnected it?  I have a great book on
fuel injection by someone named Norbye, and nowhere in the description of the
K-Jetronic system does he mentioned this valve.

These aren't car-disabling questions -- just curious.
