I can't figure this one out.  A friend of mine has a1 3.0L with Webers and
K&N air filters.  I think it's an '80 or an '81 and it has been upgraded to
a 9.8 compression ration, although I don't think the year or the upgrades
matter.

Several times now, after a heavy rain or car wash, it refuses to turn
over.  The starter engages, you can hear (and see) it try to turn the
engine, but it doesn't turn.  Last week when this happened I tried to
turn the engine by hand -- wrench on the fan pulley, the usual way -- and
I couldn't budge it.  Eventually we started it by pushing it and letting
out the clutch in 2nd gear.  It hicupped and burped for a while, but
finally settled down.

A local P-shop, very well reputed, said they have seen this in several
other 3.0L/Weber/K&N combos, and attribute it to water getting into one
or more of the cylinders and hydraulically locking the engine.  They even
said they have seen damaged pistons/rods as a result of trying to start the
engine in this condition.  They related this to my firend.  I wasn't part
of the discussion, but it's the only thing I can think of too that would
lock the engine like that.  But I'll be damned if I can see how you can get
that much water into the stacks.  They are, after all, covered with a metal
cover.  The water can't go sideways through the K&N filter, and even if it
could go sideways, how much would actually get through the filter?

Has anyone else had this problem?  Do you know what it is?
