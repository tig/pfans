Back in June I posted this plea:
"My alternator light no longer goes out as soon as car (81 engine and
peripherals) starts.  Instead, it stays on, growing gradually dimmer, until
about 3000 RPM.  Got to fix fast, I suspect.  Might this just be a bad
regulator, or have some diodes fried?"

I got several kind replies, generally speculating that I was going to need a
rebuilt alternator.  

I had a shop deal with this while I went to Texas hoping to race and
attending the Parade.  They said diodes were fine, but replaced the
regulator and said that the commutator (?) rings looked pretty worn, and
a rebuild was in the offing.  Then they thought better of this, and
replaced the alternator and sent these worn rings back to me with the
car.  There are 2 of these rings (copper?).  The brushes bear on them,
and they allow the juice to get out of the rotating part of the alternator, to
whose coils they are connected by wires.  The rings fit over a plastic
part, which in turn fits over a steel axle shaft.  

The brushes had worn deep grooves into the rings.  One was so deep
that about half of the circumference of the ring had worn through to the
plastic underneath.  My guess is that when this started happening, the
RPM at which any production of voltage above battery level would occur
began to rise.  Eventually I found the voltage in the car wouldn't rise
above battery level at any RPM.

So if this happens to you, now you know.

p.s.  There is another insidious thing which can happen, alternatorwise. 
If the regulator quits working entirely (at least on an 84), the alternator
light won't come on to tell you.  Only if you notice the absence of its
friendly red glow when you turn on the key before engaging the starter
will  you be tipped off.  If you don't notice this, you will learn of it at night
in some remote spot when the car quits running.  So smile when the light
comes on during startup, and if it doesn't don't buy off on the wishful
notion that it is just a burned out bulb.
