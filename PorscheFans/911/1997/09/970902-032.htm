Doug,

I have the short shift kit installed in my '67 911 racer.  No problems with
the quality of the epoxy joint, etc., but then again, not a lot of miles on it. 

However,  when I installed it, I found that the increased length of the
shifter caused it to hit the heater cable tubes and other hardware in the
tunnel.  (Impossible to get into reverse and first gears, difficult for 4th &
5th).  Since I was converting to the track, I moved the offending metal
tubes.  If I had wanted to keep the heater, I probably would not have
installed the kit.  I don't know if this would be an issue with your vinatage
911.

 I recently purchased my 82 911SC Targa and of course it has the mile
long shifter throw...(Second gear actually hits the seat)I've looked
into purchasing the Weltmeister Short Shift Kit and was just about ready
to drop the cash, when I spoke with another gentleman who related that
many people are unhappy with the kits. He heard people complain that
the
shifting mechanism became very stiff and even hard to get into gear... I
was wondering if anyone out there in Porscheland had experience with
the
kit, and what they thought of it.
