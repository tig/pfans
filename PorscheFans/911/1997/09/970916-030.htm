     Hi Phriends,
     
     The time to replace the brake pads on my 84 targa is at hand -- this 
     will be my first time (so please be gentle...8^)).  Between reading 
     the Haynes and lurking here on the list, I thought I had a good handle 
     on what to do...but last weekend, I had the rear wheels off anyway 
     while adjusting the valves, so I took a quick look at the rear 
     calipers.  What I expected to see was the pads held in place by two 
     pins and a spring clip, with the each of the pins held in place by a 
     retaining clip.  What I saw was the pads, the pins, and the spring 
     clip -- but NO RETAINING CLIPS FOR THE PINS.  (What the ???)
     
     So I have two questions (and thanks for your patience with my 
     overwhelming ignorance here):
     
     1.  What's holding the pins in place?  (They're solidly in there, and 
     I didn't see any holes through the pins where retaining clips 
     could/should be.)
     
     2.  How do I get the pins out so I can R&R the pads?
     
     Any hints, tips, techniques, cautions, etc would be warmly welcomed.  
     TIA --
