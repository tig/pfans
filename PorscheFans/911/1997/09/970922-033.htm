In regard to intake runners or velocety stacks- they are tuned in length to give a max torque at a rpm - changing the length gives torque peaks at different rpms - on the street it is a compromise as in racing but in race car can change gearing for differnent tracks and would also change length of intake pipes to set up torqee.  

Sometimes (in old days?) would use different lenghts on different cyinders to make two torque peaks which would flatten out a overall torque curve over the rpm range as it s the area under the curve that is more usable then peak torque.
 
In fact this whole variocam (is this the right name) on the new cars changes the length of the intake path of air at different rpms to allow ideal length for peak torque as rpms increase.

I think the reason stacks fell out of favor after the '60s was that engine development got better and torque curves flattened out so wasn'tneeded.  Remember a high peak torque or HP is not the only important thing to make a car go fast.  If it is available at one RPM an power drops off around it you need lots of gears o stay at THAT RpM.  So cars with less HP or torque but flatter curves can be faster because it is more usable.

There I have said WAY to much.
