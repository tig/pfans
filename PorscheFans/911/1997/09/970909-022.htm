Robert,

Last year, my '86 911 exhibited similiar problems. I was tracking the car and the
engine would get real hot. The starter would not turn over and I'd have to
jump start the car. When I researched the problem, I was told two different
things:

1)  The starter is going, it's time to replace it.

2)  Check the ground wire from the starter and clean the connections. I think
     I also seen this advise in Automotion.

I did nothing except park the car on a hill, just in case. The problem just
went away. I've driven the car all this year, actually club racing it, and haven't
had any problem. Now that you brought this up, I'll probably have a problem
this weekend!  But if I do, I'll check the grounds first before spending $$ on
a new starter.

Regards,
Cal

  79' 911SC that doesn't like to turn over when warm. Turns over easily
when cold. Do these 911 starters draw more current when warm,  putting
to much of a load on the battery? 135,000 miles on the car, I bet this
starter is old. Easy way to check the starter? If it's not
starter/battery what else could it be?
