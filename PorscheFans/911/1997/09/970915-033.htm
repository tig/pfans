Hello,

I just read a quick review in Autoweek of the new 911.

In short, it looks like the car will be a winner:
lighter, more horsepower, more interior room.

They do say it has become more of a GT car than
a pure sportscar. That is indeed a shame.
Hopefully, Porsche will come out with an
'S' type version that is sportier.

I did notice a few silly things.

1. The motor is water cooled. There are radiators
behind the headlights. However, there is also an
electric fan behind the grill on the motor deck
lid (I never know if that is the hood or the
trunk in rear engined car). Why do you need a 
fan there in a watercooled car?

The other silly thing is that the car has a
High Mounted Stop Light (HMSL) like all cars
sold in the US since 1986. The car also has
a rear 'wing' that raises at speed, like the
C2 from 90+. The silly thing is that when the
wing is in the raised position, it blocks the
HMSL, so there is ANOTHER HMSL located in the
rear of the wing! That sort of looks like the
'sports' sedans that have sprouted rear tack
on spoilers that also contain a light. TACKY!

Other than that, I love the car. I guess that
since I already have a watercooled car I can
look past the new motor. More HP, less weight,
hopefully same price.

I'll take it!
