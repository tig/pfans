In a message dated 9/11/97 3:35:33 AM Central Daylight Time, you write:

<< If you remove 300 pounds from a 2500-pound car with 200 peak HP, you 
 increase the peak-power-to-weight ratio from 1:12.5 to 1:11... A 
 13.5% improvement.
 
 This is "equivalent" to a 13.5% increase in power... That is, you'd 
 have the same peak-power-to-weight ratio if you left the car alone 
 and boosted the motor to 227 HP.  >>

This is all very true, but only takes into account the acceleration phase of
the assistance that lowering weight provides.  Braking is also assisted, as
is cornering.  Therefore the "effective" horsepower on a car that also
corners and braking is somewhat more than just the effect on acceleration.
 That's why I suggested in another post that 10 lbs = (roughly) 1 horsepower.
 In the example here, you could expect another 3 "effective" hp from braking
and increased cornering speeds.  This is precisely why I run my class J Club
Racer at as close to minimum weight as is possible!  When I only have 95 hp
to begin with, I can't afford to throw any away!!
