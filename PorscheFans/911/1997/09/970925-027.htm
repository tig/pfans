Hi, all,

Time to change my oil, probably this weekend.

A couple of questions - I've looked through all my collected oil change
info, and I'm left with 2 things to ask...

- What are the tightening torques for the oil tank and crankcase drain
  plugs? (I'll hunt in the owner's manual, but dunno if it's there or not)
- Does it matter too much what type of anti-seize compound I use on these
  plugs? Specifically, do I need to worry about using an oxygen-sensor-safe
  anti-seize (I burn VERY little oil)? Or is it safer to just lube the
  threads with engine oil?
- ok, I lied... 3 questions... Ray Calvo's 993 oil change info mentions
  both a seal washer AND an O ring on the oil tank drain plug. Does anyone
  know if this is true for a 1990 964 as well?

I'll be hunting around for a BIG oil pan too!!! ;^)

Cheers!

Ross
