Nill, let me give it a shot.

First, for A/C, this is only supplied via the center dash vents; you cannot
get
A/C air out the defroster or foot vents.  The controls on the console adjust
the A/C fan and the compressor clutch.

Second, I believe you have three slide switches on the dash controls.  The
upper
one controls the defrost/heating main fan.  Moving it farther to the right
will
increase the speed.  The two switches below this largely just adjust the 
proportion of air between the footwells (heater) and defroster.  Both full
left
means all air goes to the defroster vents; both controls full right means
all air goes to the heeater (footwells) vents.

On the floor by the handbrake you will find another control, which might be 
different depending upon options.  Standard is a four position (as I
remember)
rotary switch and (I think) two hand levers.  The levers adjust the amount of
heated
air that is allowed into the cockpit; the rotary switch adjusts the fan speed
of the
footwell-mounted heater blowers (separate than the one in the dash for the 
defroster/heater control). An option is an automatic temperature control of
the 
levers; this adjusts the degree of heated air admitted based on the
temperature setting you set on the floor-mounted rotary switch (same location
as above-
described floorboard rotary switch).

My cars ('76 and '84) had the manual heater controls.  I always found that as
I slowed down, I had to back off on the floor-mounted heat levers to avoid
being roasted (you lose outside fresh air faster than heated air as you slow 
down).  Also, on humid days took a while to defrost windows due to not being
able to hit them with A/C air thru the vents, like on "normal" cars.  Best
option
might be to run A/C and be colder than you would like, and turn up defroster
heat flow.

Hope this helps.

I give up.  I thought I more or less understood how the various
heat/vent/AC controls worked, but I clearly do not.  And the owner's
manual is not a model of clarity either.  Will someone please give me a
primer?  I have an '87 with regular AC, no climate control.  With wet
weather coming, I at least need to know how to defog the windshield
effectively, but it'd be nice to really know how the whole convoluted
assemblage of levers, knobs, buttons, vents, pipes, wires, clothespins
and wingnuts is supposed to work together.
