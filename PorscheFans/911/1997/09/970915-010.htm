     OK, who has changed the oil on a 993? I was going to change mine for 
the first time on Saturday. After removing the underside panels, I found 
that nothing was where I expected it to be from previous 911's.

     I never did find the oil tank! Where the hell is it and do you drain 
it?

     The only thing that looked like a drain bolt was at the front of the 
crankcase just behind the clutch. Does that drain all of the oil?

     I found the short oil filter above the red heater hose on the right 
side but never did find the long one. Where is it?

     Is there anything else I need to know  about an oil change that is 
different than previous 911's

     The owner's manual doesn't give any information other than to  tell you 
to take it to the dealer for an oil change. Geez, Porsche, you should know 
by now that many owners do their own maintenance and at least tell them 
where the drains and filters are when you changed all of this on the 993.

     Someone clue me in so I can stop feeling like a complete moron.
