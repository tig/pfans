Nick,

I tried to e-mail you direct, but my message was returned. The 2.4S pistons
and cylinders would not be a good choice for you. They would be a good
choice if you had 2.4T engine and you wanted to make an easy and
inexpensive upgrade. I would suggest finding a 2.4T shortblock and using
your 2.2S pistons, cylinders, heads, fuel system, etc. Your pistons will
need some machining to avoid striking the crankshaft, but everything else
should bolt right on. You will end up with a much higher compression ratio,
and a much peppier engine. It would also be the least expensive upgrade
route. It is my intention to incorporate the 2.2S pistons in my 2.4S
engine. That is why I'm selling the 2.4S pistons and cylinders. There are
books available that can give you specific numbers as far as horsepower and
compression, in relation to this set-up. 

Thanks for the interest!

Terry Merrell
