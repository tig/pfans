Someone commented that you shouldn't use synthetic gear oils in Porsche
transmissions because they are too slippery for the synchros.  This is
untrue.  Synthetics are sometimes a little more slippery that a convertional
mineral oil but not to much so for the synchros.  Synthetics are approved by
the factory for use in all Porsche transaxles.  
It is, however, important to note that gear oils, both synthetic and
convertional, carry additives designed for different applications including
open, limited-slip and non-slip.  Each should be matched to your particular
application.   Synthetics will generally offer smoother shifting, lower
operating temps and longer life.
Most of the synthetic lubricants readily available in the United States are
made with Mobil base oil plus somebody else's additives.  Mobil, Texaco,
Chevron, Shell, Valvoline, Castrol, Amsoil , Red Line are some makers of
synthetics that will work well in Porsche transaxles, I am sure there are
many more.
