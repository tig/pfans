My experience with my 84 Carrera is that the switch can be pulled out
carefully without removing the door panel as noted.

However, I also had a switch that did not work on the passenger's door,
but the window could be put up and down from the driver's side (read as
motor OK).  The switch is a only toggle
with little mechanically to fail.  So I bought some good (CFC kind)
contact cleaner from an electronic store for $5, removed the switch
and sprayed in the cleaner, moving the toggle back and forth. Use
care to ensure that plastics are protected and the stuff won't melt
tp plastic goo. Returned the switch with cleaned contacts and viola.
no problems since.

Our Central PA web site has (in addition to other things) a classfieds
section that ALL are Welcome and encouraged to submit their free
postings...please see submission guidelines.
