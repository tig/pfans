Always.

The wave is somewhat dependent upon geography. Here in So Cal, the wave is
rare. When I drive to the grocery store, 1.75 miles from my house, it is
not unusual  to pass three 993s, and possibly a Twin Turbo, let alone an
assortment of older Porsches, during times of heavy traffic.

The concentration of Porsches around Beverly Hills/Sherman Oaks/Studio City
is astounding. It's not only Jerry Seinfeld going to the studio, it's damn
near everybody.

If we were to wave, we'd have our hands off the wheel an unsafe amount of time.

Hereabouts, you don't even wave to another car of the same year and color.
'Cause it's just not that unusual. But get out of town a bit--Malibu, for
instance, and it's more common to wave at similar Porsches. In fact, the
farther out you go, the more likelihood of a wave.

The headlight flash most often means: 'cop ahead'. And mostly, we reserve
that warning for our own kind...
