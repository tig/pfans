Jeez, everybody seems to be coming down pretty heavily on Ron here. You
guys are just perpetuating the practices of many shady P-car mechanics
out there. They shouldn't have started tearing down the guy's engine
without indicating they would do that - and they should have given him
the option of a quick set of pressure tests to see if there really was
anything wrong with the P&C's before disassembling it. I have no
sympathy for the kind of arrogant shops that trot out the old 'if you
have to ask, you can't afford it' line. If you don't ask, you're a fool,
and if they don't give you the chance to ask, they're pirates.

For some of you, $1000 may be petty cash, but for others, who pour a
substantial amount of their income into the cars they love, it means
something. Ahem... Soapbox off.
