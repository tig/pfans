Note:  The account from which this post is originating not one I'm supposed
to be using (it isn't even supposed to exist anymore) and is a hassle to use.

Every time I try to post from my "real" (work) account, I receive the
following error message:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eli_Leland@trilogy.com is not allowed to post to the list.
please contact listmaster@porschefans.com if you have any problems.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I dutifully contacted the listmaster with an email describing my
problem, but the only response I received was an automatic reply which
included a FAQ list that doesn't address my problem.  I wrote listmaster
again, hoping that somone might read the messages sent there, but as yet
I have only received another automatic reply.

Any ideas?  I receive the 911 list in digest form at the account in 
question without any trouble, and I can post from the account I'm using
now (obviously) but I'd like to be able to do both from my regular account.

Resubscribing didn't do any good, either.  I send and receive email using
Lotus Notes at work.  Could this be the problem?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Please reply to:
eli.leland@trilogy.com

Thanks,
Eli S. Leland
