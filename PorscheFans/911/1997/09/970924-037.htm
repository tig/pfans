The first to second shift is a slow one. I always double clutch the
third to second down shift, but if I remember correctly, it too has a
tendency to grind. If you shift slowy, not under full power, and 3 to 2
always grinds, then the syncros are likely to be worn. At low rpms I can
go from 2 to 1 with no grinding at all. But even new syncros are not
that great compared to a modern (Honda Integra for instance)
transmission.

For optimum shifting with a 901, consider the following: 

Is the clutch mechanism worn, if not -  is the clutch properly adjusted

Is the shift  linkage worn or misadjusted

The transmission internals may be misaligned (proper alignment is not
trivial and requires an alignment tool); misalignment may be common.

Use synthetic oil or at least be sure your oil is the correct viscosity

In my car the first to second up shift is a four step process - out of
first, into neutral, move towards second and feel the syncros engage,
then you  slide into second. What I'm trying to say the motion from
neutral to second is really a two step process. When I pay attention,
then the 1 to 2 shift works well. Under high rev, quick shifting
conditions it never works well. Try shifting before (rather than after)
the power curve peaks (at lower revs) and shift a bit slower. 

Does the above make sense to those experienced with 901 transmissions?

The first to second shift is long and awkward. As Bob Williams said,
first was just to get you out of the pits, and the early 911
transmission is not meant for power shifting and quick 0-60 times. My
901 was refurbishd to have new syncros and really needed to be properly
aligned. No it works much better. Even with all the mechanicals correct
it will still grind. But under low power (low revs) it does not grind at
all.   

Finally, what is the downside of starting out in second if you really
want a fast 0-60 time? Will doing this infequently cause excessive
clutch wear and/or crank or rod bearing wear, or excessive transmission
bearing wear?
