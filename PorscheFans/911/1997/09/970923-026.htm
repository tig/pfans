I own a '72s which was converted to carbs by the PO.  I have recently
installed a new distributor because the old one was worn out.  I would like
to know where or how I can obtain a intake vacuum source.  The intake
manifolds have a casting depression over the #2 and #4 cylinders, and one of
these I drilled out only to discover that a pulsing vacuum source is located
here.  Duh,  I would have realized this had I thought at all about it first,
the valve opens=vacuum,  valve close, etc.  Is there a way to hook up the
vacuum with carbs and K+N filters(i.e. no air cleaner air box)?  The reason
that I would like to do this is to obtain ~35 degrees at 6000 rpm, without
setting the timing beyond TDC at 900 rpm.

TIA
Mark
