I can't say that I am a qualified engineer, but my solution was to use
a V-sub strap (6-point), attach to the same mount points that the lap
belts attach to, and feed the strap between the seat and seatback.  
Actually, this solution was suggested by Hank Watts, so it isn't MY
solution.

On the driver side, I attach the V-sub strap to a Brey-Krause fire bottle
mount that is mounted behind the driver seat.  Having the fire bottle
mount behind the driver restricts seating position, but I tend to sit
in a very forward position.  Two other drivers drove this car during my
first GGR TT a few weeks ago and neither complained. 

As for the GGR TT, this was my first event.  I don't really have much to
compare it too.  16 years ago I went though the BSMR (Jim Russell West
Coast series), but I don't have a clue what that school is like today.
I found the GGR TT a very educational and enjoyable experience.  It took
me a little time to get use to the instruction (my problem), but I think
it was all first rate.  My instructors included Hank Watts, some guy named 
Hurley Haywood (got him to sign my car under the trunk lid) and two other 
very good instructors.

I would recommend this kind of event to anyone who wants to learn and 
experience driving their Porsches fast on big tracks.  While it is a 
competition, it really is what you want to make of it.  The majority of 
laps are spent as practice laps with only two timed laps after lunch on 
Sunday.  If you don't want to compete, there is nobody there twisting 
your arm, it's your choice.

And to be honest, I feel much more comfortable on the track with 
experienced drivers who want to drive fast, than in-experienced drivers
in their first events.  Right now, I'm in the later group, but some day ...

My hotlap timer counted 57 laps (55 me, 2 Hurley Haywood) with maybe 12
other laps un-recorded.  That works out to over 120 miles of TH for the
weekend for $230.  Students are charged an extra $50 (that will last one
more weekend for me) and $60 (I do not work the weekend).  It can be as 
cheap as $120.  Even as a student, $2 a mile is not that bad.  Try to get
that rate at your local Malibu :-).

And don't forget auto-x's.  Problem is, there aren't enough weekends a
year anymore since I bought my Porsche. :-(
