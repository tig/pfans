Someone on the 911 fans digest, as well as the boxster mentioned that
Valentine (spelling?)1's were the radar detector of choice, and that
from time to time Valentine offered refurbished detectors at reduced
prices.  Would someone please give me his phone number so I can contact
him?  Also any dealer who carries his products at retail would also be
appreciated.

Could it also be possible that other radar detectors are better than the
Valentine?  I'd love to start a new thread, if it is useful...

Having been out of the Porsche mainstream for almost 18 years, I am
quite perplexed at all the model designations. I am up to speed on the
model designations up to the 904. But a guy on the digest the other day
was talking about his 994 for example.  Can someone bring me up to speed
with all the different disignations (including the models that
went-a-racing, and what they reprasent. I know my boxster is a 986, and
a 993 (which I have on order) is a 911 wide body 2cv and a 996 will be
the new model, but what about all the others in between?

Many thanks in advance,

Steve Hubbard (Charleston SC)
