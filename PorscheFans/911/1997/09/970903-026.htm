(Original question with my reply:)

1.  I would like to entirely replace my brake fluid (Castrol GLMA) with ATE
Super Blue.  On the newer Porsche's, however, one needs a handheld
computer to release the solenoid/hydraulic valve to bleed the integrated
clutch/brake hydraulic system.  Is there any other way to do this?  With
car started, clutch pedal depressed, right pinky finger in left ear, etc.???
I would like to do this regularly, but cannot due to difficulty/expense of
having dealer perform the job.

REPLY:  I don't think you need the computer.  I have bled the brake fluid on
my 993 several times without problems.  I use a pressure bleeder connected
to the brake fluid reservoir to pressure-force the fluid out the caliper
bleed
ports, one wheel at a time.  Admittedly, I have not done the clutch, but the 
brakes came out fine.

2.  I have seen and ordered the ATE SuperBlue fluid, but recently noted
that ATE makes two kinds of brake fluid.  Both have the same boiling
temp, but one is DOT 3-4 approved.  Does this mean anything to me in a
street car setup, or should Super Blue only be used for racing
applications with SS brake lines?

I have used it for approx. 100,000 miles on my old '84 Turbo-Look, and have 
it installed permanently in my 993 (22,000 miles now).  No problems in 
either car; this is with the Super Blue.

3.  The other day, after car sat in garage for a week, both my Seatbelt
and Airbag warning lights came on and stayed on.  My mechanic says
this may be due to some collision sensors near each front shock tower
and that again, he needs to look at the problem with a hand held
computer.  I'd normally break down and buy this gadget, but at $2500,
maybe I can wait a bit.  Any ideas?

REPLY: Spending $100 - 300 at a dealer is a lot cheaper!  For the heck of 
it, checked 993 owner's & shop manuals; could not find common fault 
that would actuate both lamps (seatbelt lamp should go out upon buckling
of belts).
