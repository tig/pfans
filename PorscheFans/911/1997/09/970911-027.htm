 This has been my experience also.  Recently I put my '66 911 on the road.
Being Porsche-less for the last 4 years, I have been blinking my headlights
to oncoming Porsches as I used to do with my '89 930 turbo cab. But now I
recieve only blank stares rather than a reciprocal response.  I thought at
first it was due to the car's vintage. But perhaps not.
