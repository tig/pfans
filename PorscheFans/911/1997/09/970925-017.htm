Scott,
 For the transmission, why don't you call Gary Fairbanks (advertises in Pano)

and ask? I've only purchased parts from him but he was very reasonable on
those. $4000 seems awfully high but maybe that's just what a dealer has to
charge to make a living.  Even then it seems at least twice as expensive
as it ought to.

The SSI's replace the stock exhaust/heat exchangers with a pre-75 setup.
Many garages won't touch this sort of thing as the pre-75 setup didn't
have a catalytic converter (i.e. big fines$$$). I have this setup on my
'86 and it's louder than I'd like and I only have heat on one side. All in
all a _big_ pain and many dollars for a few horsepower and nicer throttle 
response.  In retrospect, not worth the $ equivalent of two weeks of
track time (Driver Ed.).
