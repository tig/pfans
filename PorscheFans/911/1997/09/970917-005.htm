I'm getting ready to do a few maintenance projects to my 80 SC coupe, and
wondered if I can get a few opinions from people who have "already been
there".   I also have a few parts needs.  

My return tubes are dripping, and I want to replace them with the expandable
type.  I used the tubes sold by Tweeks about 10 years ago on a 73T, and they
seemed to work OK, but I sold the car a year later, so I don't know how well
they held up.  Automotion sells another type of expandable tube and they are
on sale this month.  Does anyone have experience, good or bad with either
type of expandable oil return tube?  Only two are dripping, but I will
replace the whole set now.  It's only a matter of time for the others. (What
was that old saying about 911's.... if you have a 911 that isn't leaking
oil, you have
a 911 with no oil in it.)

I need a new door switch for the factory alarm with a key.  The switch works
but the PO lost the key and I'd like to get it working again. Anyone have
one they don't need or is there some way to get a new key from Porsche?  

I am looking for a used car cover that will fit an SC coupe with a turbo
tail and rubber front air dam.  I don't use a cover often, but would like to
find one by November for winter storage to keep the dust off. 

Does anyone know a shop near Madison Wisconsin that is good with Porsche air
conditioning?  I need a recharge, but would like to have the whole system
checked out.  

What is the exact proceedure for getting a Kardex (Cardex?) build order from
PCNA?

Anyone with any experience with rebuilt transmissions from Vertex, PAR or
someone else you can recommend?  I will need some syncro work someday, and
was wondering about just swapping for a rebuilt?  You can answer by E-mail
if you don't want to post an answer.
