Fans,

I compared the ease at which my clutch pedal is depressed to another club
member's car (mine is an 87 coupe, and his was an 88 25th anniversary).  I
found that his clutch pressure was a feather weight compared to my more
'calf-training' pedal depression requirement.

He just had his disk, throw-out bearing, pressure plate, and shaft along
with new needle bearings (not the upgrade in Automotion) installed.  I had
the exact same thing done about 4 years ago.  The clutch NEVER felt as
'light' as his from the beginning.  

Is there any adjustment that can be done to make the pedal lighter in
heavier traffic?  I have no problems shifting gears what so ever, and I
know there is limited amount of adjustment that can be done on the
hydraulic clutch system.  Can anyone provide suggestions on what might
account for the difference in stiffness?

Joe
