Happens all the time. Especially with the C2S. I have carloads of low-lifes
swerve into my lane--apparently to provoke me into accelerating for their
pleasure. I have people all over the road trying to catch up and drive
alongside.  The 5.0 mustangs and Z28 owners seem affronted that I would be
on the same street with them. And the brand new baby Beemer owners (usually
328is with paper plates) seem to want to prove how much faster they can
drive. I just ignore 'em all.

When I had my 951, swarms of tricked-out Integras would challenge me
constantly.

I'm using a Bursch on my '72T. It seems to help with the power a bit, but
the noise level is fairly embarrassing.
