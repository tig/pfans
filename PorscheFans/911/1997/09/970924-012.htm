I have a 92 cab, and recently bought Porsche's windstop (as opposed to
an aftermarket manufacturer) from a mail order house advertising in
Pano. I bought it because my girlfriend doesn't like the wind at
(ahem)highway speeds... 

It is Porsche's part # 000 043 202 10   -- BUT-- the literature I read
on this particular part indicates that it is ONLY for 1986-1994 cabs;
perhaps Porsche has another part # for your year cab...

It does what it says it does- it dramatically cuts down wind buffeting
at highway speeds-- but there are tradeoffs. 
1. You are looking thru the mesh material of the windstop whenever you
use your rearview miror.
2. You must momentarily move it out of the way everytime you want to
fasten the canvas bonnet over the top after you have lowered the top.
3. It will COVER your rear package shelf/rear seat while in use- making
that space virtually unuseable.

It is made of aluminum, quality plastic and mesh; it is all black. It
installs in under ten minutes the first time (no tools or modifications
required); after that you can set it up in under 2 minutes, and it will
stow in your front trunk if you don't want to leave it in place (Porsche
also sells a storage bag for this thing - 
part #000 043 202 11). The fit and finish of the windstop is typical
Porsche quality. 

The windstop retails at the dealer for just under 500., but is commonly
availible by mail order for about 380.

Hope this helps,	-Gregory Gastman
