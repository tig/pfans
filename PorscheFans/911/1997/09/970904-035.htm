Ron,

I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.   You bring your car to my
shop after
overrevving it and ask me to find out what is wrong with it, and what it
will cost to fix 
it.   There is only one way . . . to disassemble it and see what's broken.
Yes, a leakdown
could infer what's wrong, but it's not completely accurate, and if you have
brought the
engine to me I have some reason to believe that you will let me finish the
job.   So I take
the most accurate pathway, and get as far down the road as I can.

Then you return to my shop and get all over me about my methodology.    

Hmmmmm.

I can fault the shop owner for charging you eleven hours of labor for a
diagnosis that
didn't take that long - - eleven hours is a bit long for removing the
engine, splitting it from
the transaxle, putting it on a stand, and going at it with a zip gun and
speedwrench until the 
heads are off.   An experienced mechanic can do this much in maybe half that
time.

Since I was not present when you and the shop owner first talked, I have no
idea what was
said, what you told him, what he told you, or what either of you understood.
But the pathway
he took was a valid one, though not the only possible one.   

Based on the information presented, I think the shop owner is technically
right, but is charging
for two many hours.   What should you do?   Pay him and be done with it.
You are talking about
$835 dollars total, and no more than half of that is even at issue.
That's about three hours of
lawyer time, and hardly worth the effort in small claims court.

Hey, mon, there are a lot of money grubbing assholes in the business and a
lot of shit happens.
This is small potatoes, infuriating as it may be.

Dave
Shop owner AND Porsche owner
