(Hi Walt,
Can you post this for me?  I haven't been able to post for many weeks
now...I must have been a bad boy or something.  I've tried un- and
re-subscribing and cannot get our glorious WebMaster to respond to my
multiple queries.  I'm not the only one who cannot post, so can you
please post this for me and request our WebMaster address the problem
publicly.  Based on previous traffic, I believe we were changing the Web
Server software last/this month, but haven't heard what progress has
been made.  Thanks, ChrisK.)

Hey Phans,
I've got some interesting questions I was hoping someone might be able
to answer.
1.  I would like to entirely replace my brake fluid (Castrol GLMA) with ATE
Super Blue.  On the newer Porsche's, however, one needs a handheld
computer to release the solenoid/hydraulic valve to bleed the integrated
clutch/brake hydraulic system.  Is there any other way to do this?  With
car started, clutch pedal depressed, right pinky finger in left ear, etc.??? 
I would like to do this regularly, but cannot due to difficulty/expense of
having dealer perform the job.

2.  I have seen and ordered the ATE SuperBlue fluid, but recently noted
that ATE makes two kinds of brake fluid.  Both have the same boiling
temp, but one is DOT 3-4 approved.  Does this mean anything to me in a
street car setup, or should Super Blue only be used for racing
applications with SS brake lines?

3.  The other day, after car sat in garage for a week, both my Seatbelt
and Airbag warning lights came on and stayed on.  My mechanic says
this may be due to some collision sensors near each front shock tower
and that again, he needs to look at the problem with a hand held
computer.  I'd normally break down and buy this gadget, but at $2500,
maybe I can wait a bit.  Any ideas?
Any help would be appreciated.  ChrisK. '90 Carerra 2, Polar

(Chris - anybody who has "Naughty" as his license plate is automatically
suspected of being a bad boy - perhaps the Webmaster knows this).
