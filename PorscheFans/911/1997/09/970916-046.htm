It's time to add a harness bar and belts to my 91 C2 and I wanted to 
tap into the collective for some advice.  My use will be strictly driver's ed.

Equipment

As for a harness bar I am going with a Speedware.  Their quality is 
great, the price is better than Brey-Krause and I think I can get it in 
black powder coat for that stealth look.

As for harnesses I was thinking Momo, Schroth or Sabelt.  They all seem 
the same to me.  Probably go with 3 inch and a cam lock.  Not going for 
anti-sub straps.  Most people don't seem they are needed for driver's 
ed.  Could always add later.

Mounting

This is where I have the real questions.  Has anyone done this on a 964 
before?  Can I retain the stock belts for daily use?  Can I make the 
new harness entirely clip in so it can be quickly removed?
