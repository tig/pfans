I go with the second option at the most.  If someone is hanging around the
pits, they're in the wrong place to be trying to spark up conversations.
This driver may be mentally or physically preparing to race or winding down
and thinking through the last race.  It's hardly fair to intrude under
these circumstances and beyond the pale to complain if you get a cool
(certainly not rude as some have commented) reception.

I'm new to the game too, but by choosing a conservative and extremely
polite approach to other racers, I've invariably found good people at the
track (GGR PCA) and I've made a few friends already.

Sure, we all stand around in the pits and socialise, but if you're trying
to strike up a conversation with a stranger, why not wait until you're
clearly not imposing, such as when they're relaxing at the end of the day?

Why did I bother to enter this thread?

Well, don't give up and don't hold your current opinion of criticising
people at the first break.  Be encouraged to continue attending events and
please don't start judging people they way you did in your posting.

"decompsoes into a Boxster"?  Charming.
