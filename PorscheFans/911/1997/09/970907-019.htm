That would probably be me, as I have written diatribes about V1's.  
Valentine Research: 1-800-331-3030.  Ask the sales person if any 
return units are available.  They are 10% off regular price, and 
indistinguishable from new. They only sell direct, no dealers.

No.  No other detectors offer multiple bogey tracking coupled with 
front & rear coverage for loacting radar sources. These features are 
invaluable.  On top of that, the V1 is among the most sensitive units 
available for K and Ka bands.

I'm up in Greenville.  What equipment is on the Boxster?
