Troy, you wrote:

quite a lot. Would a K&N air filter make a noticeable difference?>

Troy,
This question appears quite frequently in all matters automotive. In short,
the answer is Yes, it is relatively inexpensive; but using K&N's will NOT
make a noticeable difference. K&N's are not the best air filters,
not-withstanding all the glowing testimonials from racers and "FilterCharger"
national print ads. Do they flow more air? Yes, they might. However, in the
world of air filtration, you can't have it both ways. The filter must pose
some restriction in the intake tract in the process of filtering dirt and
dust particles out of the intake air stream. If the filter flows more air
(similar to not using a filter), the air is not being filtered as well. In a
street vehicle, a high priority might be engine longevity. You'd be amazed at
the volume of air that an engine uses. The engine is basically an air pump
and allowing abrasive particles inside an engine is a sure way to increase
cylinder wall and piston ring wear. For me, gaining a theoretical 1% more
"power" (if that) is not a tradeoff I'm willing to accept. However, I might
if I'm a racer with K&N sponsorship.

If there is any gain from their use, it could be from replacing the factory
air housing and ducting with K&N's filter housings. The factory is concerned
with intake noise levels and, in so doing, may restrict air flow to the
filter element. If you want a better filter that will not restrict breathing
as dirt accumulates I would not consider K&N's. Look into the various
reticulated foam filters that off-road racers use (car and motorcycles).

I'm sure this will unleash another torrent of postings on K&N pros and cons.
Okay everybody, have at it.
