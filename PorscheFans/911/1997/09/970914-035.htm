Adam,

The U.S. M3 has a 3.0 liter engine with 240 HP. That works out to 80 HP
per liter. The new 996 has a 3.4 liter engine with 296 HP. That is 87 HP
per liter. Any engine with over 80 HP per liter is doing well. You can get
engines to develop more HP per liter but you sacrifice drivablity (torque)
to accomplish this. Look at the Acura Integra GS-R. It generates over 100
HP per liter yet most people would like the drivability of the standard
Integra better. To get 100 HP per liter you have spin the motor faster
which means you have to beef it up which means it will cost more. 

The new engine sounds pretty darn nice to me...so does the new car. If I
could just get used to the looks (it is getting better all the time).
