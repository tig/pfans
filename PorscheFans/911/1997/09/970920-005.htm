I have a RS America and I would like to lowered it, but I dont
want a stiffer ride or at least not to much stiffer.
Is there someone to help me to find the best set up?
I am looking for 1 in. to 11/2 in. drop.
What about cutting the original springs?
Thank you.

Pierre:
First off, don't cut your original springs as this will only increase
the spring rate and
give a stiffer ride along with the drop in height.  Last winter I
installed H&R lowering
springs in my C4.  The ride is slightly stiffer but even with 17" wheels
the ride is acceptable
for the street.  If you have the threaded spring pirches on your shocks,
these springs give
you an excellent ride height adjustment range (1-1.5").  The original
springs had the front
adjustment as low as possible, which was still too high.

There are a lot of choices out there depending on how much you want to
spend.  RUF,
H&R, Andial, Eibach, etc have "solutions".  My research showed the H&R's
are approx
20% stiffer at all corners than C2/4 stock and have a similar package
for the RSA.  The
Eibachs are 20% stiffer in back and the same as stock infront plus I
think they have expanded
their line.  Both products are reasonably priced, good quality and are
progressive springs.
Your stock RSA springs are already 40% stiffer (and progressive) than
stock C2/4 in the back
and the same as stock infront.  Choosing either aftermarket spring will
probably shift the cars
handling characteristics as well as lower it.  Be sure you know which
way it will shift before you
choose and that you'll want the car to handle that way.  I suggest
calling a shop you trust and
discussing it with them.
