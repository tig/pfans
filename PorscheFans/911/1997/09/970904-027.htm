1) Mark Hald asks how to get to his idiot light sender.  My suggestion is to
lower the engine.  Note, lower, not remove.  Disconnect the shift coupler
in the rear of the tunnel in the passenger compartment just to be safe
(the allen head set screw at the rear, not the pinch bolt at the front - that
way you won't have gotten things out of adjustment when you put it
back on), put a jack under the rear of the engine, and remove the two
bolts out at the sides which hold the engine support to the motor mounts. 
Lower the engine, watching carefully all around so you don't stretch any
wires or lines.  When you are as low as looks prudent, stop and put
some sort of prop (pile of boards) under the engine in case your jack has
a slow leak.  You don't need to drop it very far.  At this point you should
be able to reach in over the induction system, or around it, and get at
(albeit not without some effort) the sender.  Maybe you have to take off
your air cleaner, or part of it, or something (but not your whole injection
system) to get at it - I've only done this with CIS, but I recall one of the list
regulars saying it worked with Motronic.

2) Obviously the brake fluid reservoirs were not made as high pressure
vessels.  And there is no special advantage to using more air pressure if
pressure bleeding than necessary, and probably some subtle
disadvantages.  I kind of like the suggestion of just using a hand tire
pump to keep pressure down.  But I have had the luck of the dumb and
lazy, I suppose, since I use the 30 psi or so in the nearby front tire, and
have gotten away with it for years.  Worst that has happened is that the
clamped off bit of hose I used to stick onto the reservoir vent to block it
off would spit off, luckily without being followed by a gusher of fluid. 
Nowadays I use a hose pinch clamp on the regular vent line.  Plus I like
the scheme someone wrote about where you just use the vent line as
the place you inject the air - seems simpler than the system I learned and
use involving a spare cap modified with a valve stem in it.
