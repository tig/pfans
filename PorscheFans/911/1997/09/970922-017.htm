For those of you who were kind  enough to write to me and all others, here
is the first set of info..more will follow.
Nitrogen diffuses more slowly in tire rubber than oxygen, and  a lot
slower. If you look up the data in a polymer handbook, you will find that
the difference is a factor of 2.5 to 4 at room temperature, depending on
the rubber. Some of you thought that diffusion was controlled by atomic
size, but that is only true for the rare gases with completed electron
shells. That IS why it would be good to put nitrogen alone in ordinary
tires, as the pressure will be better for longer, and corrosion of metal
bands will be much reduced as well. The other points of contention about
the use in race tires will be covered in  future memos when I get the data.
