    True, Mark, which is why I was careful to specify "single-stop"
    braking distance.

    Chris's original message included a paragraph (which I didn't
    quote in my reply) explaining that he already knew about the
    heat-dissipation advantages of bigger brakes, so when he asked
    about "quicker stops", I assumed that he only meant single-stop
    distance. 

    Sorry for any confusion my response might have caused.
