My '68 911T has the embarrassing tendency to stall. At first I thought
it was me. This is a recent problem. The car is normally warm, when I
stop at the lights I pull off as normal but sometimes the  revs just
drop and it stalls, which means if I am lucky I can roll across the
intersection. When I try and to start it takes awhile, usually works
better when its out of gear, however, when I put it back into gear it
grates or jumps in. It does this no mater how far the clutch is pushed
in. I have made a conscious effort of making sure the clutch is in all
the way before accelerating or starting. The car usually go into gear
just fine, it is only after one of these stalled starts that it grates.
I have also noticed when it is quietly idling that every few seconds the
revs drop its a small blip, from someone else's post I realise that this
could be the vacuum control needing to be looked at. By the way what
should the car be idling at, mine idles very low?

Second problem. I had to buy two new rear tires, Yokohama's A
something's (I can't remember and its raining outside)  anyway the tire
place could not put them on as tubeless because the valves they had
would not fit and seal properly in the Fuchs mags. I have experienced
this before and the car also came that way. The upshot means that all my
tubeless tire have tubes. This latest set on the rear has given the car
a very twitchy rear end. I was watching while they balanced the wheels
and the readings on the machine after the weights were fitted did read
zero. Does anyone else have this problem and are there special Porsche
valves to fit Fuchs mags?

All answers will be appreciated.
Thanks
