Hello folks,

We have all heard about the importance of having equal length pipes in
our exhaust systems to ensure maximum performance etc etc.  With that in
mind, can anyone explain to me why the induction stacks on early (MFI)
911s (71 to be specific) have a verticlal inlet stack for the middle
inlet and the two outer ones are canted toward the centre?  I would have
thought that the same principles would have applied to inlet as well as
exhaust.  e.g equal length path for induction air.   Was this a case of
having to use the same air cleaner housing for the Carb engines as well
as the MFI engines?  I would really appreciate some discusion on the
subject as it has me very intrigued to see if this was a 'production' or
a 'performance' consideration.

As always, thanks in advance for your feedback


Azim
