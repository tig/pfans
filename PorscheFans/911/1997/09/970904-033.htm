..Hi,

I own a 1973 911 Targa.  I was recently driving my car in Toronto and
happened upon a Ferrari 308.  Needless to say testosterone and
adrenaline took over and our speed increased dramatically.  Due to an
older gearbox with worn bushings, I mishifted from 2nd back to 1st and
lost the race.  I then noticed that my car didn't have the power it did
2 minutes before.  The car was also making a tapping sound.  I drove the
car to work and proceeded to call the nearest service center.  I then
called Hiemrath Porsche. and explained the situation to Mr. Hiemrath
himself.  He advised me that it sounded like I had bent some
valves.....He called a tow truck and had my car picked up.  He told me
that he would not be able to look at the car till late afternoon and
that I should call then.  I called back and was told that the motor had
a severe oil leak and it needed to be cleaned.  I gave him the go
ahead.  I called him the next day at about noon.  He asked me to come
down to his garage because he wanted to show me something.  I asked what
he was referring to and he explained that there were some
irregularities.  I went to his garage and walked in to find that the
motor had been removed and was being disassembled on a bench.  He
started to explain to me that the motor was a carbuerated  unit
converted to a fuel injection motor.  And told me that it was assembled
improperly by a previous mechanic due to some seals etc.  At this time I
started to question what he was doing...he told me he was the one to
bring Porsche to Canada back in the 50's and he knew what he was doing.
I though to myself  the way to check for bent valves is to do a
compression test and then a leak down test while the motor was still in
the car  to determine  which valves are malfunctioning.  I decided not
to say anything because of all the credentials on the wall.  I thought
he was acting in my best interest.  He then asked me to sign a work
order for the estimate. I told him to get a final price on the work
needed and call for authorization.  I then went home and started to call
around for 2nd opinions I was told what I suspected, that a leak down
and compression test should have been done before removing the motor.  I
called the next day and was told I needed 6 exhaust valves 4 intake
valves 3 rocker arms and new gaskets due to the leaks.  He told me the
cost would be approx $5400.00 canadian to fix the motor.  I told him to
stop the work and tally up the bill.  I then called a few shops to find
a replacement motor and found one for $3500.00 they told me that they
would install it for $250.00 I called Hiemrath back and asked what my
bill was.  He then spit out the ludicrous figure of $935.00 due to $100
towing and rest as labour @ $75/hr
I was set aback at the huge figure and questioned why the motor was
pulled and why he didn't  do the proper procedure.  I explained that I
had called a few other shops in Canada and the States and was told the
procedure was  a leak down and compression test. He got upset and went
on about how they've been around longer etc. I told him I felt that I
should only have to pay him for the towing and 3 hours labour because he
shouldn't have pulled out the motor to diagnose the problem I also told
him he had pulled the motor out before he obtained authorization from
me.  He got upset again and said the bill is what it is and I 'm not
budging from it.   I told him I would consult an attorney he said I
don't care if you consult god himself I'm in the right and I have a
signed work order and hung up.  I called the Ministry of Consumer
Relations and was told that I had no choice but to pay the bill either
to him or the court to get my car released.  If I paid him I would then
have to sue him in small claims court.  If I paid the court, then I
could go to him with the receipt and he would have to release the car
within 3 days.   and then we would have to settle the matter in court.
Either way I'm out $935.00.  The problem is that I need my vehicle out
before he starts charging storage.  I also am worried that if I pay the
court, within that three days he could damage my car for selfish
reasons.
  If I pay him then I would have to sue him and may not get my money
back.  I called head office of Porsche Canada and spoke to a rep there
and was told that they revoked their dealership from Hiemrath Porsche on
Lawrence Ave .E  over 1 year ago.  They wouldn't specify exactly why but
that it was due to ethical reasons.  They said that they are no longer
affiliated with Mr Ludwig Hiemrath in any capacity and therefore they
were in no position to help.  I then called a few shops in the area who
specialize in Porsche repair and they weren't surprised as to what I
told them.  I was told by a particular establishment that  Mr Hiemrath
is notorious for this type of conduct.  I was also told that I shouldn't
have signed the work order because now I'm liable due to the mechanics
lien act.  I now have to make a decision as to who I should pay.  I am
definitely going to persue with legal action which ever way I go,  along
with filing complaints with any governing  bodies that may have
jurisdiction over these types of affairs.  I am also thinking about
approaching the local newspapers about this matter.
    What I am wondering is if anyone else out there has had a similar
problem in the past with Hiemrath Porsche service or any other shop for
that matter.  Any advise would be well appreciated

Signed
Sincerely Screwed Over,
