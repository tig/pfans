Hi Terry. These are the sizes in my 1979 model 915:

Flange nut holding reverse & 5th sliding gear on pinion shaft:  36mm
Castellated nut holding reverse gear and 1st gear on input shaft: 27mm
Flange nut on clutch end of input shaft:  42mm

I used Craftsman sockets on the first two.  I needed a breaker bar with=
 a
cheater, and my wife standing on one leg of the engine stand to keep ev=
erything
from tipping as I cranked them off.  Instead of Porsche tool P37a holdi=
ng the
input shaft while I did this, I sacrificed the rubber centered clutch d=
isk that
I found when I took everything apart.  I just put the disk back on the =
input
shaft and figured out a way to bolt it to the case or the engine stand =
(watch
out for the asbestos).

I have a very large adjustable wrench that I used on the 42mm flange nu=
t to get
the measurement.  Let me know how you hold the input shaft to get this =
nut
off.  Mine is still on.  My manual shows another special tool (P355a) t=
o hold
the opposite end of the input shaft while removing/installing this nut,=
 and I
don*,t have it.  Hopefully someone out there has another solution?

Hope this helps!
