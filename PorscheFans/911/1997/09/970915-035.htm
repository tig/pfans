PFans:
This weekend I did a little brake work on my 83SC.  It was fitted with
Hawk pads, High Performance Street.
Here's the quandry.  The rear pads were substantially more worn than the
fronts.  In fact, I replaced the rears and not the fronts.  How can this
be?  The laws of physics tell us all that the front brakes take the
brunt of the braking force...indeed, I have had cars with the rear pads
lasting through three sets of the fronts.
Is there a brake bias problem here?  Can I adjust that or is there a
part that needs renewed?

The car is used at the track and the brakes seem to work just fine (it
is essentially stock and will turn sub 2 minute times at MidOhio---which
is not shabby in my estimation, at least with me at the wheel.)

Any help or comments will be appreciated.

	I have an 84 Carrera with Cool-Carbons that experiences
the same wear patterns as your car. I usually go through two rear sets
for each front set. I have no problem with rear wheel lock up.
I have spoken to other 911 owners of the same vintage and it is  pretty
commong for that to happen. I know, it is weird, but I just don't
worry about it. Just buy more rear pads :)
