I plan to purchase a Carrera oil cooler from a local Porsche
owner that has upgraded to a valence-mounted cooler.  I have
taken a look at the cooler, however am not sure what it is
supposed to look like since my car is an 82 911SC which came
with a tube-type cooler.  His car is also an SC, and he
upgraded to this cooler from the stock one several years ago.

The cooler is black, about 2" thick, taller than wide, and has
a black metal plate extending from the edges.  The edges of the
plate are rimmed with a thick foam padding of circular
cross-section.  I guess that this is to conform to the space
between the fender and the cooler to ensure that airflow goes
through the cooler.  It comes with two factory lines that
appear to be in very good shape.  There is not a fan, however I
already have an aftermarket one (push-style).  There is not a
stone guard (slotted metal sheet?) on the front of the cooler.
I have seen these under the fender of other Carreras.  The
cooler says "Behr" on it, and looks like a quality part.

Does this sound like a Carrera cooler, some other type of
Porsche oil cooler (e.g. "RSR"), or an aftermarket part?
Should it come with the "stoneguard" plate to protect the front
from rocks?  Where does the fan go?
