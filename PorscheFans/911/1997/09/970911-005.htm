We can figure this with a little calculator exercise. 200 HP in 2500#s is
a 12.5/1 wt-hp ratio. Dropping 300#s (200 & 2200#s) takes you to 11/1
wt-hp ratio. In order to get an 11/1 ratio without removing weight, you
would need 227 hp (2500# / 11).

Gear ratio changes don't increase HP, but remember that HP isn't a
totally relevant number, it's how much torque you deliver to the wheels
at any given time. Lowering the gear ratio (higher numbers) gives more
torque multiplication and therefore puts more torque to the wheels, so
there will be an increase in the rate of acceleration. Probably would be
a better "seat of the pants" feel, but whether it's enough for you is
subjective. If you lower the gearing in a car with a motor that has a
peaky torque curve (ie: drops off quickly at high revs) the lowered
gearing may not give much improvement. All three of my vehicles below
have relatively flat torque curves and all accelerate very well in 3rd
gear where they can stay in the "meat" of the torque curve for a longer
period of time.
