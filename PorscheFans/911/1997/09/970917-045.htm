Martin,

I would use 22mm torsions bars on the front and 30mm on the rear. I would
then put a 22mm sway bar on the front and a 25mm on the rear (Charlies
Bars). At the very least, I would put 22mm front and rear....

I would put Bilstein Sport shocks from the Turbo on the rear and the
Bilstein Sport inserts on the front. This assumes you have
Bilstein-compatible struts.

911's are too roll stiff in the front as it is. The combination you would
have with 23mm/29mm would be even worse....
