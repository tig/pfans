15-20 HP by using platinum spacers to index your plugs.  Something
about the better heat transmission characteristics as well as the null
grounding induced by the platinum.  Supposedly much better than
aluminum or copper which are just base metals.  An added benifit is
supposed to be better flame propigation.  Anyone have any thoughts on
this.

My first thought was of P.T. Barnum.  Most if not all of the heat transfer
from a spark plug (made of steel, which is iron, and a reeealy base metal
- this terminology is almost back to earth, air, fire, and water) to the
aluminum head is through the threaded area.  That's why using antiseize
on plugs is one of the never ending controversies.  Keeping spark plugs
cool enough is not one of the major problems with 911s.  You keep the
plug tip at the right temperature by selecting a plug with the proper heat
range for your engine, whose air/fuel ratio and ignition timing you have
where it is supposed to be.  The crushable washer on the spark plug is
there to seal, not as a major part of heat transfer.  Anyway, since you
are transferring heat from steel to aluminum to get it to the cooling air,
those metals limit the transfer, and putting something in between, even if
it is a better conductor (my Glover Pocket Reference doesn't give
conduction coeficients I could find), isn't going to help.  A washer is too
small to act as a heat sink, and ill placed as a heat convector.

Now indexing, that's a different story.  The 911 plug (up to the 3.6s?
anyway) is off to one side, so pointing all the plug side electrodes the
same way (maybe toward the center of the combustion chamber?) could
help flame propagation - the side electrode acts as a sort of shield
(though not much of one).  356 racers and Formula V guys do this, I
think.  I think I saw indexing washers in one of my Detroit iron/drag racer
catalogs also.  Anyone done any dyno testing on a 911 with indexing? 
Not the easiest thing to do with the plugs stuck way down in their
burrows, though.  And 10% power increase seems unrealistic.  Our
cars have pretty good ignition systems.  I might buy 1 or 2%.

Guy once gave me (thinking I was a local opinion leader, I guess) a fuel
line magnetizer, making all sorts of claims for it.  Supposed to polarize the
molecules in the gasoline, something impressive like that.  More power,
less pollution, longer engine life.  I put it on (just fit it around around any
fuel line) with my 2.7 on the CO/HC meter in a shop.  Readings didn't
change at all no matter where I put it.  I like J.C. Whitney, but they carry
odd things like this along with useful items.  I started reading car stuff in
the 50s as an impressionable lad, and car snake oil claims haven't gone
away.  Just more fancy sounding terms to toss at us.
