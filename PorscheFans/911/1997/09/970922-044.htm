Bob,

	>Does anyone know how I can contact either Porsche 
	>Owners Driving School (as mentioned in Vic Elford's book, 
	>Porsche Performance Driving) or Track Time?

I think this one got answered on PorschFans.

	>I want instruction on how to get the most out of driving my 
	>993, esp on a track, but here in Northern CA I haven't found 
	>many places that have 911 experts teaching the unique 
	>driving advantages/requirements of the rear-engined

	>that they have no familiarity with rear-engined cars and can

	>Point, Laguna Seca, and other local tracks.

Well, yes.  It doesn't make any sense to think the Shelby or BMW
clubs will have a lot of expertise in 911s.

	>The local Golden Gate Region of PCA, on the other hand, 
	>has no Driver's Ed series and only a Time Trial series.  

Maybe not as big a distinction as you think.  We focus very heavily
on instruction, but we do take Sunday afternoons to do timed runs.

	>Being a competition series, they require 5-pt harness, fire 
	>bottle, and other mods that I don't want to do to my new car.  

Not exactly.  We think 5-point harnesses make a lot of sense, even 
though we have a better safety record than almost any driving
group around.  We drive faster than most of the groups, and, during
recent times,  usually go all weekend without any sheetmetal damage.  
Compare that to clubs (which I have seen locally) which will seriously 
damage or total up to 6 cars a weekend, and rarely come away without 
one serious incident.  Street belts are just not very good for high-speed
impacts, and, compared to the cost of your car, the cost of belts
and the other things required is very very small.  I agree that one
can argue about the fire protection, since we almost never see
fires, but, again, the cost is very small.

	>I've also mentioned that I am willing to skip the timed 
	>sessions if I can attend the rest of the weekend with my 
	>stock seatbelt and SA95 helmet, but no we don't allow 
	>that either.

The timed runs aren't really the point.  And, of course, your SA95
is more than we require.  The point is, if you're going to be out
there, you really need to have some good belts.  Maybe trouble
won't appear, in your case, but the cost of belts makes them very
good insurance.

	>I've checked with the neighboring PCA regions, LPR, Diablo, 
	>SVR, Redwood, but they are apparently too small to put on 
	track events so they all attend GGR's TT series.  

We other regions aren't exactly too small (my primary region is Loma
Prieta).  But there are a very limited number of dates available at the 
prime tracks and GGR has a long history of doing a good job.  You can, 
in some ways, consider this to be a Zone 7 activity, rather than strictly 
GGR.  Slightly less than half the participants at the time trials are
GGR primary members.

	>Kinda sad that the one local source of 911 driving experts 
	>won't accomodate those who don't want to mod their cars 
	>to compete, who only want to drive their stock cars better.

This is sophomoric and a little insulting.  It isn't sad at all.  What's
sad is hearing from yet another person who is sure HE won't be the
one to make a mistake on the track.  Your required mods are all
reversible and will have no impact on the cost of your car.  The cost
of the mods, including the driving suit you'll need by the third event
probably adds up to less than you pay for 6 months worth of 
insurance on your lovely 993.  (And I'm not getting snide about the
car.  I have a 993 C4 Cabrio myself.)  We don't think it would be very 
bright of us to accomodate every individual's unique idea of what would 
make a nice weekend for them.  We think it's a bit smarter to focus
on driver training, safety and make sure everyone has a good time.
We find bent metal and banged-up bodies distasteful and unaesthetic.

You should also not that these policies are, to some degree, a
reflection of the tracks on which we run.  True, ThunderHill and
Buttonwill are reasonably safe, but we have demonstrated that you
can roll a car at ThunderHill, Buttonwillow has a couple of dicey areas
around Magic Mountain, and both tracks can take cars out
permanently if you miss the turn leading onto the straight and don't
handle it properly.  More importantly, we run at Laguna Seca and
Sears Point.  Both tracks have many areas of very little runoff room,
and Sears has been rated by some as one of the more dangerous
tracks in the US.  If you check, you'll find that many (not all) of the
clubs that require less safety equipment are running at tracks where
there is a lot of runoff room and greatly reduced danger of hurting the
car or the driver.

Returning to the economic arguments, you'll also find that the GGR
series is one of the cheapest around for the track time you get (2 days,
though half of Sunday is spent on timed runs; overall you'll get over
two hours of intense track time).  This is for $130 to $170; compare
that to other programs costing over $200 for a single day, or NASA,
which charges $150 a day but provides less time.  The savings will
easily pay for the safety modifications.

Finally, GGR has a long tradition of doing an excellent job of focusing
on driver education.  We have the best instructors around.  They serve
because they love to teach and they do an excellent job.  For you to
walk away from that, for lack of willingness to make a one-time, $600 or
so investment in increasing your safety (and the safety of the instructor
who is willing to ride with you -- imagine, for a moment, one of the 
instructors explaining to a new friend that what they do for fun is get
into cars, on the passenger side, with people who want to drive really
fast and don't know how to do it very well just yet . . .), suggests that 
you either have your priorities a bit skewed or you aren't really serious 
about learning how to drive.

I'm sorry if this sounds a bit harsh, but I really think you need to start
at the beginning of this puzzle again and see if you don't come out with
a different answer.
