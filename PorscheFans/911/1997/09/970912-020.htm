I just had to respond to this since I have been on both sides of this 
"equation".  Yeh, it would be nice if the person would have been a little 
more polite or talkative.  But put yourself in his shoes.  Here he is at 
a National Championship, probably (I don't know) on grid and in the 
middle of competition.  He's trying to concentrate/compete and somebody 
wants to casually talk about Porsches.  And with SCCA's classes, he 
already has his hands full!!

Just my thoughts...maybe right, maybe wrong?
