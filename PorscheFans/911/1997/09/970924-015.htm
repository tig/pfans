 It is easy to install a 5-point harness in a 911, without drilling, and keep
the 3-point 
 street harness fully functional.  Here's how, for anyone interested.
 1. Install a harness bar to anchor the shoulder belts.  These bars generally
bolt into
     the mounting holes for the stock shoulder belt.   Use the same bolt to
secure the 
     bar and the stock shoulder belt simultaneously.  It will even pivot
normally if you
     use a shoulder bolt.
 2. Bolt the lap belts into the same holes for the stock lap belts. Use the
same bolt
     to mount the track and street belts at the same time.   You will have to
pull
     up the base of the rubber boot around the inside mount. That looks a
little funny
     but it is better than drilling holes.  Again, use a good quality
shoulder bolt if you 
     want the street belts to pivot normally.
 3. Here is a trick for the sub strap.  Get a "quick-link" from any hardware
store.  
     Attatch the sub strap to the end of the rear seat lap belt by putting
the quick-link
     through the bolt hole of the sub strap and the hole in the male end of
the lap belt.
     Run the sub strap under the seat and up around the front.  Presto! A
secure 
     5-point belt without any new holes, and you have the 3-point belt for
convenience
     on the street.
 I hope this helps.
