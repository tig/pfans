No kidding!  If I could afford a 96 or 97 Twin Turbo I would order it without
a lot of the extras and then make it even faster myself.  Do you realize how
fast you could make that car for $50 to $60,000?  It would be unreal.  Heck-
the AutoThority package alone adds 100 hp for a mere $8,000 - and it's still
emissions legal!  RUF could take my 1979 930 and for an extra $70K could make
it beat just about anything on the road - including the new Twin-Turbo's.

<<Seen your postings on the site and I hope as a rookie, I'm not adding
stupid, insipid comments.  Really enjoy reading all the emails from
all the various 911 owners>>

Not at all.  There are no stupid or insipid questions, and don't think I'm
anything more than a rookie myself (I'm actually quite young ~23), I'm just
experienced at being opinionated and always speaking my mind or sharing some
knowledge.  I read A LOT and have a very good memory for things that interest
me.
