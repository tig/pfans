    Brooks:

    The primary benefits of the Optimas are that they're light,
    they're immune to vibration damage, they won't leak acid, they
    can't explode, and you can mount them in any position, even
    upside down.  If you're a drag racer, you don't have to worry
    about the battery's plates banging into each other on launch,
    since there ARE no plates.

    They last as long as (or maybe just a little bit longer than) the
    longest-life lead/acid batteries... About six or seven years or
    so.  On the other hand, they cost around $150, so the
    lifetime/cost ratio is pretty high.

    Not that I know of (or can imagine).

> Where can one be purchased?

    The racing-supply shops (Pegasus, Racer Wholesale, etc.) carry
    them, as do most of the aftermarket Porsche-parts distributors.

    Keep in mind that the Optima batteries are physically smaller
    than your current battery, so you'll need to fabricate (or buy)
    an appropriate mounting bracket.
