I saw an ad in the latst Pano for a wind screen that sits behind the
front seats in a convertable and supposedly cuts down on the wind flow.
Anyone have any knowledge/experience with such a device on 911 Cabs? I
have an '85 Cab and would like to cut down on the "messed hair" problem
my wife has when the top is down.

Bill,

I can tell you from personal experience that the wind screens do a wonderful
job. I have been trying to design one of my own this summer and have had
mixed success. If you have a well designed unit, it works great, if the
desing is not so thoughtful, you will have problems.

I have found that my biggest problem is making the wind screen long enough so
that it reaches the floor of the back seat and wide enough to reach the sides
of the car while still being small enough to fit under the cabriolet top.

If the wind screen does not go to the floor or the sides, it will just
channel a stream of air between or around the seats, causing as many problems
as it solves. If you buy one, I would love to hear how the manufacturers
design works.

Sincerely,
