Garth -  Sounds to me like your 901 tranny shifts just like it was
designed to.  1st gear is really only meant to be used to get the car
going from a start.  You can down shift from 2nd to first while moving,
but it is it is mot mdesigned for a power shift. The $300 for a tune up
sounds a little high to me, but I do most of my own work in this area.
You could also.  The toughest part is the valve adjustment.  If you're
at all mechanically inclined, it is not difficult.  See the FAQ for
instructons. Tuning the carbs may be a different matter.  I had mine
done at a local shop and they only charged $60.  Once they're set, they
run fine for many miles.

>>I've got a couple of questions: (1971 911T)

1.  My transmission shifts "up" through the gears very well.  Going from
first to second is the only place that I encounter any problems.  Unless
I
let the RPMS drop way down (IE hold the clutch in for several seconds)
and
then make the shift, it grinds.  Also downshifting from 3rd to 2nd does
the
same thing.  When I go from 2nd to 1st the car has to be almost at a
stop.
Does this sound like Syncros?  It is a 901 Transmision in a 71 911T. 
I'd
like to make my shifting smoother if at all possible.  Any
suggestions/ideas?  


4.  My mechanic wants $300 to do a full tune up on my engine.  This
includes valve adjustment, plugs, points, distributor, oil change,
filters,
and carb adjustment.  Does this seem reasonable?  I could do the oil,
plugs, points, distributor myself I suppose, but I think that getting
the
whole thing juiced up by a pro in the first place might make my life
down
the road a lot easier.  Any thoughts on this?

Thanks for any help you can give me!
