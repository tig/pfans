Terry,

Don't have a good number to give you for the value of a '67 912
engine, but consider this.  A true, complete rebuild on these engines
costs about $3K.  (New pistons alone cost about $1K.)  Therefore, an
entire engine that has just been "completely rebuilt" has to be worth
more than $3K.

Greg

'67 912
'97 986
