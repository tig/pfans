Greetings. A little help from the collective wisdom will be much =
appreciated!

Here is the situation. My =9282 SC is in excellent condition both =
mechanically and cosmetically. It never gives me any problem starting, =
either cold or warm / hot. It does have a pop off valve. This spring =
when the weather turned warm, it developed a habit of one or two =
backfires as I would start to drive on a warm start. Took it to my =
P-wrench and he checked all the fuel pressure points and concluded =
everything was fine. He then removed and cleaned the injectors saying =
that he thought they were dirty.=20

This cleared up the warm start backfire, but substituted a cold start =
backfire as I drive off. Back to my P-wrench and a new warm up regulator =
this time. Same problem continues.

This does not seem to fit any of the profiles for a cold start valve or =
fuel accumulator problems. Any ideas on what to look at next?

Thanks in advance,

Hal Michael
