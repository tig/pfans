Well, since I was at it, I have one more post that may be of interest. 
There has been some recent posts about opening up the guages on a 911
for various reasons.  I opened mine up to repaint the indicator needles
that had faded from 28 years of use.  If you're at all adept to
tinkering, have a few common tools like screwdrivers, small hammer and a
3/16th punch, this is not a difficult task as has been pointed out by
other list members.  I dissasembled, painted the needles with florescent
red and reassembled them all in just a few hours.  Real pleased with the
results.  Replacing the faces, updating the temp gauge, etc would have
been no problem.  I did call Hollywood Speedometer shop in CA to see if
I could purchase new bezels, but they won't sell them.  I just repainted
mine and they look great.
