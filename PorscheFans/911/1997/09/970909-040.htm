The gauge should begin to read after the engine is out of the white zone at
the bottom of the oil temperature gauge. This defines "warmed up" for a
911. I might add that you should not let the engine exceed 4500 RPM before
this time as well. If you are not reading in the white on the level gauge
at the first (level ground) stop after warm-up then you definitely need
oil. I prefer the "three o'clock" level as a fill rule. I know this is
heresy, but you can bag the dipstick as long as the gauge is working.
