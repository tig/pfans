Mike, sorry, can't figure out what's going on with your oil cooler.  =
However, I don't think the fact that your level gauge begins to move =
means that oil is flowing through the cooler lines.  There is always the =
same volume of oil in the lines, whether the thermostat is open or not.  =
It's the thermal expansion of the oil in the tank as it warms that =
causes the level to go up.

If your cooler is cold, you must have no oil flow.  The warm oil lines =
from the cooler are that way because of the heat conducted down them.  =
I'd go with a failed thermostat.

Anyway, when you sort out that problem, how about the details of the =
patch job you described?  Size of hose and size of fittings would be =
great.  I have a couple of oil line sections that could use this repair =
myself.

Good luck!
