I just got a quote from the local Porsche dealer for about $4000 for a
transmission rebuild.  Is this reasonable?  And while I'm at it, I think I
would like to go ahead and  do some exchanger/exhaust work (as in
replacement).  I have heard that SSI heat exchangers are the best. 
Opinions?  I've also heard that early stock mufflers are as good as
anything aftermarket (at least that doesn't blow you out of the car).  Any
opnions?  And just to show my ignorance on the subject, are the heat
exchangers and muffler all there is, or are there headers, too?  If so,
who's are recommended?  Hope I don't open up a can of worms here.  Thanks
as always.
