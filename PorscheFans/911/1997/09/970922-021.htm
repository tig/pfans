I have a '90 C4 which is going to be needing a new clutch and flywheel
in the next few months. I was wondering if anyone has installed one of
those lightweight flywheels instead of the stock dual-mass flywheels.
What are the pro's and con's to replacing the dual mass affair?

Thanks in advance

I have a '90 C2 and nad to make the same decision.  My understanding is
that if you put in the lighter assembly, you're also going to need to put in a
new chip (about $600).  This is because you will not only make revs
faster, the engine will wind down faster, and with the stock chip, will be
prone to stalling.  Also, I've heard that the lighter flywheel is a pain in the
butt off the line, which is pretty important if you drive the car every day
in city traffice like I do.  Therefore, I put in a 993 flywheel and clutch
assembly, and have been happy ever since.  I wound up getting the
whole assembly partly used for $600 from a new 993 owner who
decided to turn his 993 into a race car.  I would look for a similar deal, if I
were you.
