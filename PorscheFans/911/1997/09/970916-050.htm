Ken:

Who ARE those "most people" who recommend against sub straps?  Send 
them over here so I can slap some sense into them.

See, here's the deal:

With the possible exception of the Schroth belts (which I'll address
in a bit), 4-point belts (dual shoulder harnesses and a lap belt, but
no sub straps) can be MORE dangerous than the stock three-point
belts.

The reason is simple:  The stock one-piece belt is a subtly clever
design in that it allows your upper body to rotate forward a bit in
the event of a crash, which folds you over the lap belt a bit while
pulling it taut over your hips. Four-point belts don't do that, so
you run a very real risk of sliding under the lap belt and having it
crush your internal organs. 

The four-point DOT-approved Schroth belts incorporate something 
similar to an inertial reel in one of their shoulder harnesses... On 
impact, that strap "gives" a little, so your upper body pitches 
forward and folds over the lap belt, preventing it (more or less) 
from riding up over your hips.

Unfortunately, those DOT-approved Schroth harnesses are, as far as I
know, only available with two-inch-wide straps.  This may be a
requirement for DOT approval (maybe because two-inch belts are more
comfortable for women and children?), or it may simply be a decision
they made on their own... I don't know.

In any case, I'd forget about "adding later" and just buy a decent
six-point setup right from the start.  Sub straps will only add about
$15 to the cost of each harness, and you should be able to mount them
to the existing lap-belt mounting points, so you won't even need to
cut holes in your seats.
