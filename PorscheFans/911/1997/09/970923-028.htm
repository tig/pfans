Hank,

I've read your book, watched you at the autox, admired your new Cab, and so 
it is with the greatest respect that I take serious issue to your reply to 
my original post:

(big snip)

	>Kinda sad that the one local source of 911 driving experts
	>won't accomodate those who don't want to mod their cars
	>to compete, who only want to drive their stock cars better.

This is sophomoric and a little insulting.  It isn't sad at all.  What's
sad is hearing from yet another person who is sure HE won't be the
one to make a mistake on the track.  Your required mods are all
reversible and will have no impact on the cost of your car.  The cost
of the mods, including the driving suit you'll need by the third event
probably adds up to less than you pay for 6 months worth of
insurance on your lovely 993.  (And I'm not getting snide about the
car.  I have a 993 C4 Cabrio myself.)
*******************************************************
ANS:  You infer throughout the reply that cost is the reason for my 
reluctance at adding safety equipment here.  Not true.  I spent $400+ just 
for the helmet alone so I don't consider cost to be an object.  What I do 
object to, however, is that GGR/Zone 7 somehow thinks it is necessary to 
require me to drill holes in my new car just to learn to drive it at the 
tracks, the same tracks where I've driven with, let's see, BMW CCA, Shelby 
Club, Green Flag Driving Assoc, Checkered Flag Racing Assoc, NASA, even the 
SCCA Track School, and NONE of these other organization require safety 
additions other than the helmet, long sleeve shirt/pants, and sometime 
gloves.

I can't believe that somehow tracking the 911 is so much more dangerous 
than other cars that PCA requires this add'l equipment when the other orgs 
who teach at the same tracks don't.  Heck, even the other PCA regions that 
have advertised DE schools on Pfans don't require mods.  So why is it that 
GGR is the only one that thinks add'l safety mods are needed?  Can all of 
the other clubs be wrong?

The only answer I can guess at is that TT is a competitive event and the 
insurance requires this add'l safety equipment.  Which then goes right back 
to my original post where I said I was looking to drive my car better, not 
compete in it.

Oh, and what about the holes and the mods such as harness bars.  May be I'm 
a purist, may be it's the new car, but I don't want to start drilling holes 
in my car for many reasons.  One is the risk of introducing rust-friendly 
holes in the galvanized body.  Another is that this is not a track-only 
car, I do social activities with it including business socializing, and I 
don't want my clients to get the wrong impressions as they (one at a time, 
of course!) strap into the 5-pt harness as we go to lunch.

I would even consider installing and removing the bar and the harness just 
to attend GGR events, but I *really* don't want to drill holes in my car, 
and GGR will not accept inside lap belt and sub belt anchor points that   
don't require drilling.  Besides, the stock seat doesn't hold the shoulders 
or sub belt in the right place anyway, so the spirit of higher safety 
requirements of GGR would dictate an aftermarket seat to be *really* safe!
********************************************************************

We don't think it would be very
bright of us to accomodate every individual's unique idea of what would
make a nice weekend for them.

***************************************************************
ANS:  You know, Hank, what triggered my original post was an article in 
GGR's monthly Nugget, where the President wrote:  "Of our 1200+ 
members...about 400 are actively involved in GGR activities...There is a 
last group of people who don't attend any events.  I suspect they belong to 
get Pano and Nugget.  This trend of 60-70% non active members is typical 
for all the larger PCA regions.  If that is all you want from GGR, OK.  But 
believe me, you would get more enjoyment out of being actively involved in 
GGR activities.  What can GGR do to temp you?"

Well, guess what?  I don't participate because GGR don't offer what I need! 
 As mentioned in my original post, no one has taken an interest in my 
request for a DE series where we don't need to modify our cars, including 
YOU as the Chief TT instructor per your above paragraph.  GGR officials are 
simply not listening to its members, and though I joined PCA happily as 
soon as I got the 993 thinking that it will offer the same benefits as the 
other clubs, I will most likely not renew next year because of the 
officials' attitudes.
************************************************************

You should also not that these policies are, to some degree, a
reflection of the tracks on which we run.  True, ThunderHill and
Buttonwill are reasonably safe, but we have demonstrated that you
can roll a car at ThunderHill, Buttonwillow has a couple of dicey areas
around Magic Mountain, and both tracks can take cars out
permanently if you miss the turn leading onto the straight and don't
handle it properly.  More importantly, we run at Laguna Seca and
Sears Point.  Both tracks have many areas of very little runoff room,
and Sears has been rated by some as one of the more dangerous
tracks in the US.  If you check, you'll find that many (not all) of the
clubs that require less safety equipment are running at tracks where
there is a lot of runoff room and greatly reduced danger of hurting the
car or the driver.
*******************************************************************
ANS:  Again, the other six orgs I've run with don't think that DE events 
(not competing) at any of the tracks require additional safety equipment, 
and I can't believe they are all wrong.
*******************************************************************

Returning to the economic arguments, you'll also find that the GGR
series is one of the cheapest around for the track time you get (2 days,
though half of Sunday is spent on timed runs; overall you'll get over
two hours of intense track time).  This is for $130 to $170; compare
that to other programs costing over $200 for a single day, or NASA,
which charges $150 a day but provides less time.  The savings will
easily pay for the safety modifications.
************************************************************
ANS:  Again, cost is not an issue here, but rather the way that GGR is the 
only club that requires additional safety equipment for its DE event.  And 
IF it is not a true DE event, but only part of a TT event, then it is still 
sad that GGR can't be like other clubs and offer a true DE series.

Sadder still is the fact that GGR used to offer a once-a-year true DE event 
at Sears Point, that required no add'l safety equipment, and that event's 
existence proves that even GGR recognizes that true DE events doesn't 
require other safety mods, even at a track "rated by some as one of the 
more dangerous..."  If GGR can offer one event, why not more like other car 
clubs?  I've also heard that even this one event is being cancelled.
***************************************************************

Finally, GGR has a long tradition of doing an excellent job of focusing
on driver education.  We have the best instructors around.  They serve
because they love to teach and they do an excellent job.  For you to
walk away from that, for lack of willingness to make a one-time, $600 or
so investment in increasing your safety (and the safety of the instructor
(snip)
***********************************************************
ANS:  Once more, it's not the money, but the holes and the 
installing/removing for every GGR event and the fact that no other clubs 
require this.

PS.  As far as beginner status and how I don't know what I'm doing and may 
be going too fast for my abilities, etc:  prior to getting the 993 this 
year I've tracked my M3 and 300ZX TT with the clubs above since 1994, at 
least one DE event a quarter and sometimes as often as twice a month (can 
you say track junkie?) without getting a wheel into the dirt (although I've 
put two wheels on the rumble strip once or twice!) so not only do I drive 
within my limits but I am well aware of what DE is about.  Hence my search 
for the Porsche Owners School and Track Time because I want to focus now on 
learning to drive my latest car.
