Hello,
    I recently replaced the original cassette player in my C4. The original's 
left side channel was fading in and out. I don't listen to the radio very 
much, but I figured that I would like to have a nice unit in this car. I 
looked at a lot of different options, but ended up buying a Blaupunkt Los 
Angeles in dash CD player. It is a very nice system, and looks really good in 
the dash. I actually didn't think that it looked that good on the shelf, but 
once in the dash it looks factory. It is the exact same size as the original, 
and I was able to use the original mounting sleeve. 
    The installation was very easy. I am not sure if your car's original setup 
is like mine, but on mine it went like this: Due to the weird connector coming 
from the original amp, I had to bypass the amp. I'm told that this is better 
anyway because the radio's internal amp is actually better than the older amp 
in the car. The factory speaker wires all run to the amp, which is underneath 
the passenger's seat. I had to run new wires up to the radio. All I did was 
splice into the existing wires, underneath the seat. This I very easy, and can 
be done with the seat in the car. You must unplug the wires from the amp and 
pull them back behind the seat. Once the wires are spliced, run them up to the 
radio. You could go under the floor padding, or over it. I went over it so as 
not to have to pull up the padding. I tapped the wires flat along the floor 
and ran them right up to the radio. They will be underneath the carpeting and 
the mats, so they are fine that way. The rest is really easy. Splice the wires 
from the old harness into the one supplied with the radio, and you are all 
set. Plug everything in, and slide it back into the dash. 
    I am by no means an audiophile, but it sounds very good to me. It is 
easily the best radio that I have ever owned in a car. I have not once been 
able to make the CD skip either. The detachable face is a nice security 
feature too. I am very happy with the performance, and love how original it 
looks. Also, I bought mine from Best Buy for $229. A rebuilt original '89 
cassette unit through Porsche is $389. 
    If you have any questions about it let me know. 
Regards,
   --Josh
