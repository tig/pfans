Indeed! This has nothing to do with the 911. Or Porsche. The 911 is not a
cosmologic gift that is bestowed on the deserving--anyone with monetary
resource can buy one. You encountered either an ass (as you put it) or just
a guy having a bad day. There are many kinds of 911 owners, so don't be
overly surprised when you encounter one who does not share your sense of
mysticism about the car. That said, welcome to a huge group that *does*
share your love of the beast!


Wow! Shades of "Early Edition". Young college guy wakes up every morning to
find a  different 911 (color, year, bodystyle, etc.) in his garage. He has
to use the car to do good or it decomposes into a Boxster...keep wishing
kid!
