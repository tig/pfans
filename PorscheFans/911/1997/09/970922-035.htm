 Bob, 
 
I instruct with the Shelby Club and when attending events have been designated 
the rear engine instructor as I've raced front engine, rear engine, front 
engine/rear transaxle and mid engine cars. I've gotten in C2s and 993s that 
have showed up at our events with stock seat belts and instructed them with a 
very critical eye on safe driving as the cars are IMHO too damn fast to be on 
a track like Sears Point without more protection.  When someone does come to a 
Shelby event with a late model Porsche, I always recommend that they put in 
the minimum equipment and go the GGR Time Trial events as they are populated 
with rear engine instructors and are the safest events you can put a 911 on a 
track at. 
 
If you talk to other regions, you'll find that they lose cars at many Drivers 
Ed events.  GGR has a great safety record in the TT series, you don't have to 
run for time and the instruction is as close to professional coaching as you 
can get in any club, anywhere.  
 
Last year I watched an RS America with 4K miles on it get totaled in a drivers 
ed group at Sears at a NASA event. Happened on the same corner and in the same 
fashion that a new 993 piled up a club race.  The 993s are great cars but will 
bite you at the limit or if you find yourself off line in certain turns.  A 
993 out of the box is capable of turning faster times than many SCCA race cars 
and your's is without the benefit of a cage, fuel cell, and fire system. 
 
You can add a harness bar, bottle and harnesses without any intrusion to your 
interior.  Don't forget to add passenger side harnesses as the instructor will 
feel a whole lot better in your car and may walk you thru some of the finer 
points of getting thru corners.....

Does anyone know how I can contact either Porsche Owners Driving School (as 
mentioned in Vic Elford's book, Porsche Performance Driving) or Track Time?

I want instruction on how to get the most out of driving my 993, esp on a 
track, but here in Northern CA I haven't found many places that have 911 
experts teaching the unique driving advantages/requirements of the 
rear-engined configuration.  I've tracked my car with the local chapters of 
the Shelby Club and BMW CCA, but their instructors admit that they have no 
familiarity with rear-engined cars and can only teach me the "normal", 
front-engine lines around Sears Point, Laguna Seca, and other local tracks.

The local Golden Gate Region of PCA, on the other hand, has no Driver's Ed 
series and only a Time Trial series.  Being a competition series, they 
require 5-pt harness, fire bottle, and other mods that I don't want to do 
to my new car.  I've mentioned to GGR that the East Coast regions have DE 
series that only require stock safety equipment, but I've been told no we 
don't do that.  I've also mentioned that I am willing to skip the timed 
sessions if I can attend the rest of the weekend with my stock seatbelt and 
SA95 helmet, but no we don't allow that either.

I've checked with the neighboring PCA regions, LPR, Diablo, SVR, Redwood, 
but they are apparently too small to put on track events so they all attend 
GGR's TT series.  Kinda sad that the one local source of 911 driving 
experts won't accomodate those who don't want to mod their cars to compete, 
who only want to drive their stock cars better.

TIA for any contact info you can provide,
Bob
