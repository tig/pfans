     Doug, Pfans,
     
        I installed the AJ short kit in my '76 911S, and experienced no 
     serious problems.  This kit seems to be the one also marketed under 
     the name Target, it is very inexpensive (less than $50), and easy to 
     install.
     
      To avoid the epoxy failure problem, I cured the epoxy joint in an 
     oven at 200 degrees F for 15 minutes (the original shifter is also 
     epoxied in).  Only minor problem I had was that the epoxy did not hold 
     the aluminum spacer block onto the shift linkage support.  So I rigged 
     a hook from a wire clothes hanger to hold the support assembly up 
     while a caught a couple of threads of the bolt.
     
     As to the shifting getting stiff and hard to get into gear, that is a 
     tradeoff with any short shift kit you chose.  The principle is to 
     change the mechanical advantage of the levers so that less movement of 
     the shift knob produces greater movement of the linkage.  The only way 
     to accomplish this is to accept greater forces to move the shift knob. 
     This change of ratios will also mean that the notches that are 
     associated with movent into each gear are also narrower.  However, if 
     the increase in force and difficulty of finding a gear is more than 
     the 20% of reduced throw distance you get with these kits, there is 
     another problem (maybe linkage alignment, which will change with kit 
     installation, and the linkage should therefore be realigned as part of 
     the installation).

     '76 911S pearlized white (still in the paint shop)
     '97 Boxster, Silver/black, tech sport suspension, Htop -- WOW!!!!
     '96 Saturn SC2, seems like less fun than it used to.
