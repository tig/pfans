Scott, you wrote with the following questions on your engine:

> 2.  First gear synchro needed.

The 915 gearbox is baulky at best, so it could be your box  is normal.
However, if your first gear synchro is shot (you're getting a "grind" when
down shifting into first while rolling), then I'd live with it until your
money situation is better.

2. 1, 2, 3, & 6 cylinder base gaskets leaking oil.

The answer to this depends on what is causing the gaskets to leak.  If it is
because of pulled or broken studs, then don't drive another mile ... though
you're looking at cubic dollars to make right.  If they're only seeping a
little tiny bit, then don't worry about it for now.

3. Oil return tube seals leaking.

Unless you have the collapsable tubes, this will require dismanting the
engine.  However, there is an easier way: cut the old tubes out, and replaec
them with the collapsable tubes.  Be sure to use the high temp (brown) O
rings, and silicone grease (not seal) on all the rings.

Hope this helps,
.... Gregg
