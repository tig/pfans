Re Eli Leland's question about black anodized targa bars, the earliest
I've seen is '73.  I used to see a '73 with nice original paint, and
this one had black headlight grills also.  I think the rest of the trim
was chrome, however.  The first cars with all black instead of chrome
were, I think, the '74 Carreras, where it came standard although chrome
could be ordered.  On regular 911s beginning in '76 (again my informal
observation) "black instead of chrome" was listed that way on the
Monroney sticker as an extra-cost option.

Re waving--headlight blinking, I used to see quite a lot more of it in
the '70s, and regularly greeted and was greeted by 356s that way as
well.  That was just one of the things that made 914 owners feel
inferior--we (I had one for a while) couldn't do that.

Just my feeling--but the more expensive the cars get, and the more
loaded they are with luxury equipment, the less greeting goes on. 
Something to do with wanting exclusivity in exchange for the money you
spend, and the less-than-enthusiastic feeling one gets when being
matched or upstage.

Like meeting someone with a Rolex Pres on his wrist while you've been
cherishing your two-tone Oyster Date.

"Even the bad things are better than they used to be.  Bad music, for
instance, has gotten much briefer.  Wagner's 'Ring Cycle' takes four
days to perform while 'Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm' by the Crash Test Dummies lasts
little more than three minutes."  --P.J. O'Rourke
