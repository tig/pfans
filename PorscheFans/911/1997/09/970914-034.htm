Hello P-Fans,

I could use some help here. I have a 1967 911s that I purchased this summer.
It had some problems, bad brakes, dead battery, etc. nothing major. When I
went to replace the battery, I hooked the new battery up just as one would
expect, black to ground red to positive. 

Upon making the connections, I received a wonderful popping and sparking
sound followed by the aromatic smell of burnt electronics.

To cut the story short, it turns out that this car has a "positive ground"
electrical system. I had never heard of it before my little problem. The
Haynes Repair Manual (p.o.s.) says nothing about positive ground and I just
purchased the factory repair manuals and I cannot find reference in them to a
positive ground system.

Are the manuals just comming up short? Does this sound familiar to anyone? Is
the '67 911s supposed to have a positive ground? Am I just being an idiot and
missing the sections in the manuals?

Please help. All answers appreciated. 

Also, I could use suggestions on what components to check for damage from my
hooking the battery up backwards.

Sincerely,
Brian Oldendorf
