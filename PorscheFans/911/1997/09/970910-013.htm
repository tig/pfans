I was at SCCA Solo II nationals yesterday, and to my delight I saw a
bright yellow 97 993.  I watched the autocross for a while, and when the
driver of the 911 approached his car I went and talked to him.  Here is
how the conversation went:

me:  "Beautiful car you have here."
driver:  "Yeah."
me:  "How did you do today in your class?"
driver:  "Okay."
me:  "You know I just love Porsche's.  Such a beautiful car.  Lot's of
      racing heritage in the 911, don't you agree?"
driver:  "Yeah right."

Driver then fires it up and cuts off the conversation and drives off.  I
was dumbfounded.  I was really upset at this drivers arrogance, ans was
disappointed that he didn't want to talk.  I'm not old, 20 and college
student, but I don't think that is grounds to act the way he did.  I love
the 911 more than any other car, and know more about it than a lot of
people.  It was obvious I was just drooling over his car, but he was just
an ass.  I know that someday when I have my 911 that if anyone comes up to
me wanting to talk about my car I will more than willingly spend time
talking to them, and I sure won't be an a**hole!  I don't think it's too
much to humor someone who loves your car, and to talk nice to them even if
just a show.  

Well, I guess this is just a complaint about this guy's attitude.  I
didn't mean to go out of the charter of the list.  Please no flames, and I
would love to hear what others have to say about this.
