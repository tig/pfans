Welcome to thee world of oil worriers! I have 2 (yes 2 993's) and 
they both exhibit the same behavior as yours.  Here's what I've 
discovered on both the 95 and the 96:

1) The oil level gauge does not read accurately until the engine is 
really warm. Twenty seconds is nowhere near long enough. If you let 
the car sit and idle for 5 minutes you will probably get an accurate 
reading.  In fact I suggest you try it to develop some confidence in 
the damn thing. I hate driving to work (20 minutes) and never seeing 
the damn needle out of the red when I'm sitting at a light unless 
it's really warm out.

2) The dip stick is not as precise as we'd like. It has a very high 
tolerance for overfilling. On the other hand the car doesn't like to 
be overfilled and if you continue the way you are, you'll probably 
find white smoke billowing out the back of the car or even coming out 
your vents IN the car.  The most common problem with 993's is to 
overfill the oil tank.

3) Here's what the local dealer does at oil changes:

    Fill with oil until the dip stick reads near full. 
    Drive the car for 30 mins or more .. or, let idle for 10 mins 
    minimum.
    Check oil gauge, if it is not at the horizontal, slowly add oil 
    until it is.

Done this way, the gauge will actually read correctly and you won't 
see the needle in the red on a normal commute.

Bob
