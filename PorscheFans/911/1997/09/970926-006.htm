P-fans,

My 1989 Carrera 3.2 (euro - 930/20 engine) has been exhibiting the
following symptoms and I am hoping that someone could shed some light on my
situation (no dealer in the country):

1. Speedometer works 95% of the time, ie. it comes and goes as it pleases. 
No effect from bumps, temperature or such noted.

2. Engine does not pull smoothly at 2000-2200 rpm when driving at
steady-state speeds, it chugggles as if it was an ignition problem.  Yet
when accelerating through this rpm range no problems whatsoever.  End
result: must avoid driving steady speeds around the given rpm.  The car
runs smoothly otherwise.

3. The engine does not always return to idle immediately, but hangs around
2000 rpm for 3-5 seconds.  Sometimes idle speed is erratic as well,
climbing to 1500-2000 rpm for a few seconds.

The driveability of the car is good otherwise, but especially the engine
hanging on to revs is frustrating when shifting or when engine braking. 
Could the symptoms be related?  Is there a diagnostic system on the car? 
The car has low miles (35000 km) and gets good gas mileage.  I drove it 650
km on tuesday, and it performed well, except for the steady-state 2000-2200
rpm.  It does, however, seem a little light on its feet above 150 km/h, I
imagine the Carrera front/rear spoilers would help the situation.  Is there
a good source for the original or replica bits, or does someone have extra
ones they would like to sell?

I would like to sort out the driveability problems before I pack the car
away for the winter.

Thanking in advance,

Jouko Haapanen
