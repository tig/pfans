Pfans,
  I am having trouble starting my '79 930 when the engine is
warm.  There are really two symptoms that I have noticed. 
 The first:  If I run the car until its hot and then turn it off for
an extended period of time (20 or so minutes), it will not fire 
back up.  If I pop the deck lid and let some ventilation in to
cool it down it will start after about 45 minutes to an hour.  However
it just barely fires, and runs at 200 - 300 rpm for a few second (4 - 6) 
before jumping up to about 1000rpm.    The car starts fine if it doesn't sit
too long and if I let it sit overnight, it will fire back up with no problems.
  The second:  When I park the car outside on a hot day (80 - 100 degrees)
it will exhibit the same starting symptom as mentioned above. Will idle
at 200 - 300 rpm for a few second and then jump up to 1000 rpm. 

  If anyone has any ideas, I would really appreciate it.
