The "decel valve" is a pneumatic regulator plumbed up to pass air around
your throttle valve during periods of high intake manifold vacuum... or
in other words, it steps on the gas a little when you take your foot off
the pedal.  I believe they do that in order to help your catalyst stay
"lit" during long decelerations, so the cat can keep scrubbing your
exhaust.  Either that, or Porsche has part interest in a brake pad
vendor!  As far as I know there is no danger - to the engine - from
disconnecting it.

I believe the decel valve is mentioned in one of the Bosch yellow A4
"Technical Instruction" booklets, either the K-Jet or the KE-Jet one. 
Most motorhead publishers sell these, and they're worth a read if you're
curious about your injection system.
