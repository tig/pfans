The search is over - sort of anyhow.  I've been looking for a good 2.2 or
2.4 litre S, but could not pass by an offer made to me on a 1989 Carrera
with the 25yr. Ann. equipment package and only 34 000 km on the odometer. 
I'm not new to 911's, but this is way out after the simple and no-nonsense
of the older cars. Does anyone know what the package included - I assume
the car is a anniv. model, it has the marine blue colour, blue metallic
leather upholstery (of questionable taste), no badging, marine blue centers
on Fuchs, blue-silver carpeting, blue headliner etc.  But the car does not
have the plaque on the dash, nor the (even of more questionable taste)
Ferry Porsche signature embroidered on the seats.  Were these cars made
both 88 and 89 VIN model years?  Does anyone know where I could get a
period Blaupunkt to replace the Alpine the PO has put in?

I could not find the Vehicle Info sticker on the underside of the hood/by
latch - could it be located elsewhere, or is it a case of a
repaire/replaced/repainted hood, or can it just fall off?  I would like to
pin down the equipment on the car as it left Zuffenhausen.

We no longer have a dealer/importer here in Finland, nor are there a lot of
P-specialized shops around, so I will think hard and long on who will
service it... 

I better walk to the garage and get better aquainted, no driving tonight
while under the influence  of post-purchase-excitement.  It is also pitch
black and raining.
