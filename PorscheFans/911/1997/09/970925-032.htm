Hi All....
	Well I very rarely get a chance to put in my $.02
	but here is one I do know for sure.

	1) NO YOU DON"T have to drill to put in a harness bar.
	2) NO YOU DON"T have to drill (THE BODY) to put in a 5 point Harness.


	Drivers side front of
	care here.

      x|             |
      -0------&------O-    	If you drill the seat rail and insert a steel
Rod 3/4 In
      x|             |	with pin holes drilled in it at the ends to keep it
from
      x|             |	slipping side ways (Use thick pins)
				You can then connect the sub strap using a (LARGE) chain
				master-link (the &) in the sketch. It will slide left and right
				till you sinch it up then it centers itself.


BUT BE AWARE where the xxx's are it is the wire harness for the car.
PUT IN A PIECE OF WOOD OR METAL BEFORE YOU DRILL...(ASK ME HOW I
KNOW...Thanks MARK.)
After some wire patching (thanks Tom & Mark).....it worked very well at the 
track...did both sides of the car.

You could just drill the rails and connect a healthy chain and hook the sub 
strap to it. You stock seat belts part of the seat..the seat is hooked to
the rails
so it is a safe place as far as support goes...leave your self enough room
from the front
of the rail as to not make it easy to break the front of the rail because
it too thin.
The rest of the straps just bolt into the normal seatbelt bolts....
Get the eye-loops and keep your normal belts and just hook the 5 point in
for the track.
Also be aware if you are not long-of-leg..the eye-bolt on the drivers right
side
may restrict your ability to slide the seat forward due to it hitting the 
"Black Box" (brale and Heater/defrost) in the center. You can always
use the original bolt and just leave that part of the harness in the car.
You can hide it between the seat and the center hump.

								Hope This Helps Someone
								It did help me...
								Armando

P.S...Many thanks to Mark (driller and original idea) & Tom (wire repair
expert)
for there kind help. And I really do mean thanks..all kidding aside... ;)
