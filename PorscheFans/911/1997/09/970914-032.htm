Robert, I went throught this research process myself recently.  The best
solution for your situation (and consistently recommended by this group) is
to purchase (about $15) one of those welded jack plates you see in a number
of the mail order catalogs.  They slip into the jack holes on the sides,
and the floor jack raises the side of the car by the plate.  I found some
3/8" neoprene rubber which I use between the jack and plate to absorb the
angle difference and (at least some) distribute the force. I also use
little squares of neoprene between the jack stands and jack points for the
same reason.  Works very well and takes a very short time to jack up and
get the stands underneath.
