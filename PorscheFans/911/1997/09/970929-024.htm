Hi Roger,	
Thanks for the informative reply.  Wish I had talked with you sooner!
(Are you the same person who wrote the informative a/c article in the
former Porsche web page?  I think I remember trying to send mail
to you at an ix.netcom.com (or some such) address but it always bounced.)
Anywho...

Assuming that I'm not willing to give up on the a/c, remove the
v belt, and get used to life without the air conditioner, what 
advice do you offer?

If I decide to undertake a full rebuild of the system in hopes of getting
a reliable, efficient system, would I:
-- Replace all the hoses with barrier hose?  
-- Replace the Nippondeso condensor with a Sanden rotary compressor?
-- What else??

I'm a bit upset with the advice given by the Porsche dealer.  I specifically
asked if the converted, R134a system was any more or less likely to leak.
I was told no.  They replaced the front-to-rear condensor hose with the
factory replacement even after I asked about barrier hose.  The conversion
to R134a was done using the factory Technical Bulletin 8717/9501.  There
was never any mention of increased likelihood of leaks.

As mentioned before, it is a 1986 911 coupe.  I've owned it since new.
It has been meticulously maintained and the *only* chronic problem has
been the a/c.  The car has 38,000 miles.  The compressor has been 
replaced twice and the system has been recharged at least once a year.

Any advice, pointers, or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  I'd 
really like to have a car where everything works!

Thanks much,
