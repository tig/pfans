I didn't get much response to my last post on muffler opinions, so I'll ask
a more specific question.  From what I did hear, it appears that the Ansa
and Bursch mufflers are "deficient in their power output and longevity." 
Of course, they're relatively cheap and you get what you pay for so they
say.  In addition, the Bursch are apparently a little too loud (subjective,
I know).  So, the question is, if you were going to update your exhaust
with new SSI exchangers and you wanted maximum power, but money IS an
object, would it be Monty, Borla, or the OEM Leistritz and why?  In
addition, where would you buy it?

Thanks again,
Scott Cragin
