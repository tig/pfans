Hey all.  I have an 86 911 Targa that lacks a bit in the stereo department. 
I've looked around and noticed a few options.  The Moch1 underdash panel with
holes for 2 speakers seems like a good idea (although I would not get the one
with speakers, but put my own in).  Does anyone have any recommendations for
replacing the stock speakers (are they a "standard" size?) or tips for placing
a couple Amps in a 911?  Also I've heard from a few Pfans that you can remove
the rear folding seats and build a custom box to house some speakers but I
would prefer to leave the seats.  Has anyone used one of those base tubes in a
911?  Maybe mounted on the floor behind one of the front seats?

If anyone has any tips for speaker placement or if you've put a system in your
911 I would appreciate any info you could provide.  Thanks,

Andy
