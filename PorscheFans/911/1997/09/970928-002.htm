Subject:  [CevatMP]  Re Window Switch, Valve Adjust Interval

Hi All -

Would someone please share their experience/advice on two subjects?

1) Can the power window switches on my '87 Carrera be replaced without
   removing the inner door panel?  If not, are these panels similar to
   American cars' in that they're attached with many nylon push-pins,
   and never go back together quite as nicely as original?  If so, I
   might just live with crummy-but-operable switches for a while.
[CevatMP]  If your car wasn't changed, the switches could just simply be =
pulled forward. When standard, there is a small rubber pocket behind the =
switch to protect it from moist. 5 wires are fitted; they should give =
you at least 2 inches freedom to move before they drop off.=20

2) What's a reasonable valve adjust interval when the car is used only
   for spirited w/end driving, AutoX, and Time Trials?  My untrained ear
   can't yet tell when valves need adjusting - there are just too many
   sounds comming from that engine!  I've been changing oil every 3 =
kmiles
   and before TT events.  Is checking valves every other oil change
   excessive?  That would mean once or twice per year.

Thanks!

- Brad
