the answer to the question is that the Porsche doesn't keep most of it's
oil supply in the crankcase... it's in a  huge tank.... the corvette uses
much less oil which lives in the crankcase..which means that the same
amount of contaminats in a smaller amount of oil leads to sludge quicker..
the more oil, the less percentage of contaminated oil ... get it??
