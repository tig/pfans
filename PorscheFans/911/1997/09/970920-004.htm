Hello PFans!

I'm a little confused and hope that someone may be able to help me out. 

I just purchased a set of leather electric sport seats for my '83 SC. 
When I examined them I was surprised to see the seat belt clip attached
to the inside of the seat.  I thought this was strange because my
seatbelt clips are attached to the floor.  Upon closer examination I
noticed a 944 part number on the underneath of the passenger seat.  The
part number is 944.521.002.52.

Are these seats the same as 911 sport seats?  If not, what are the
differences?  Can they even be used in a 911?  

I think I got a fairly good deal, I bought the seats as part of an
interior package which included the dash, rear deck w/speakers, sun
visiors and rear seats for $ 1,000.

As I will not be entering the car in any shows, and may be modifying it
further, originality is not that important.

Your advise and input is greatly appreciated.

Andy.

'83 911 SC Coupe, White/Burgundy
