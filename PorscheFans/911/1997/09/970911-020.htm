According to the excellent online tire comparison application at
http://www.gpsgroup.com/motorsports/tiresize.htm the smaller diameter
should cause my speedometer to read about 5% fast (when going 60mph it
should read about 63mph). My measurements (timing mile markers at
various indicated speeds) it appears that my speedomoeter reads 11-12%
fast. In other words, with the standard sized tires my speedo would
still read about 6-7% fast. 

Now for the dilema: I have no problem figuring out how fast I'm really
going while I'm driving. The problem is that my car is collecting
"virtual" miles. Every 1000 physical miles I drive results on an extra
~110 miles on the odometer. Because my car has such low milage (I'm
about to hit 11000) the effect is much more dramatic and it *really*
bugs me.

.. . .

Charlie, I tested check my speedometer on a couple of occasion.  The
findings, with factory 16" wheels and tires, the speedometer was off by 5%.
 Curiously, my odometer was exact or off by maybe 1%.  I think this may be
true for other cars, that is the odometer and speedometer are not in
perfect sync. 

I can live with these errors by doing a little math to correct the speed.
You may want to consider the cost of doing nothing.  You are obviously
driving the car, 4,000 miles in a few months.  If you want to sell the car
with 55,000 miles versus 56,000 miles, I don't think the buyer will or
should care.

My suggestion, check the odometer and consider living with it.
