Chris-
Number one:  buy Bruce Anderson's Porsche 911 Performance Handbook.  It's
the bible as
far as performance modifications are concerned, and will tell you both
cheap and expensive
ways to improve your 911.  That said, the first thing (and cheapest) is to
improve the driver's
performance.  Go to autocrosses, take driver's education and you will be
surprised at just
how fast it is.  The 911 is a first-rate trackster that is capable of
humbling many high-powered,
high-dollar machines.  It's just not the fastest thing at the dragstrip,
though it's no slouch either.

Now, if it's dragstrip performance you're after (beats me, I like turning
corners :), then the most
effective thing is to change to the earlier style SSI heat exchangers and a
 B&B muffler.  It's
worth about 20-25 hp.  Be prepared to part with some serious cash though.
And if you're
thinking about engine modifications, it just gets more serious with smaller
 results.

Good Luck!
Mark
