I have been following the threads on the 993 Twin Turbo.  Since Jan '97 I
have driven a 1997 993 Twin turbo on a daily basis and have logged in 9,000
miles.  It has been a fantastic experience and I always look forward to my
daily drives.  Recently, got the Automotion upgrade for it and according to
their ads, it adds 65 to 70 HP with the $3,000 upgrade.  The acceleration
was fastastic before, but now, it is unbelievable.  Apparently it is not
street legal in California with this modification.  I have owned 2 other
Porsches including a 993 C-2 Cabriolet and this is the ultimate car!!  As
some of the articles have said, it  is the most practical supercar today.
There is no "fluff" in my car; it is all about getting down the road like a
Porsche should.
