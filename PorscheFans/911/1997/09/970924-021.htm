Hi Scott
 
I have SSI's and a Borla exhaust on my '85.  the early style SSI's are
made for a dual inlet (early style dual inlet - pre Cat.) style
exhaust.  The early style exchangers are essentially headers with a
jacket around them to heat air by passing it around the hot exhaust
headers.  the stock early muffler can be modified by adding a second
exhaust outlet to the pasenger side(minor rear valence modification
necessary).  addition of SSI's will also require replacement of a few
oil lines and, if you want heat, of an additional air pipe that I think
is called a heater by-pass pipe.
