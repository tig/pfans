Hello PFans!

I'm a little confused and hope that someone may be able to help me out. 

I just purchased a set of leather electric sport seats for my '83 SC. 
When I examined them I was surprised to see the seat belt clip attached
to the inside of the seat.  I thought this was strange because my
seatbelt clips are attached to the floor.  Upon closer examination I
noticed a 944 part number on the underneath of the passenger seat.  The
part number is 944.521.002.52.

Are these seats the same as 911 sport seats?  If not, what are the
differences?  Can they even be used in a 911?

Paul Springer reply:

I may be in the same boat with you.  I bought some seats that were in a
1989 Carrera.  I bought the Automotion adaptor brackets, and plan to use
the seats in my 1970 911.  These are electric seats with two buttons
mounted in the seat bottom.  The seat belt receivers are on the seat.  It
turns out the seats are from either a 928 or a 944.  I saw the seats in the
Carrera, so I know they bolt in.  I figure I am in for some custom seat
belt work.  I will post something about this when I get this resolved. 
Please post if you resole it first.  I still have to finish up the
paintwork and get the mechanicals back into the car, so I will be a while
yet.

Best regards
