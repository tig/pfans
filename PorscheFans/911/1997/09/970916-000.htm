Hello Porschefans,
Yesterday I looked at the warming-up problem and replaced the
spark-plugs
on my '80 911 sc usa spec's.
First I wanted to replace the Bosch w5dc for platinum ones,since they
last longer and it's a pain to change the plugs so I went to the shop
for 
some of those.They didn't have the specific model,but the guys at the
shop said they had a new spark-plug with 4 neg.electrodes,whitch will 
give a possible 8-way spark.It's also from Bosch and is called the Bosch 
Super 4.The folder said the benefits are a smoother drive,better
acceleration and mpg,and a better cold start,and absolutely save for the
catalystic-converter.For my car 3.0 sc from 77-83 with usa-specs the
right one was the w56.When I took one out of the box,they looked like
the 
Golden Lodge spark-plugs used on every Alfa Romeo with a Boxer engine.
So I bought the Super 4's  and installed them.
I made a test-drive last night with the car and I was impressed.
Smoother idle,and better acceleration from 60-140 km.Feels like i'm
having extra horsepower all of a sudden.....
Idon't know if they sell them already in the Usa,but here in Europe they
just started selling them.Price was normal,about $5 or 6 dollars a
piece.Hope this is not sounding like an ad for Bosch,but I'm convinced
they work.
