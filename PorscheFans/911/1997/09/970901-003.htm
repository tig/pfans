Reply to Josh Armstrong Re: Buying a C4



I used to own a 911 C4 (89) until July 97. What a car indeed!!!



I bought the car under the circumstance of it needing 

to be a daily driver. What I really wanted was a 964 RS.



It was bought from a dealer with a mileage of 35K on the clock.

A full service history, and in imaculate condition. You wouldn't t

hink the car was no more than 2 years old looking at it.



Anyway The problems i had with it. 

The early 3.6 Litre engines were prone to oil leaks, for the next 

yearly revisions i believe Porsche used gaskets to seal barrel/head 
assembly.

Including the front diff.



UNDERSTEERING - This i found a real nusance as it was hard to recover

from the usual lift off tuck in procedure. In the end i had the entire

suspension changed to HR/Koni with an RS set up and 18" wheels

(gemballa). Now it behaved more like a 993 - albeit with a bone

shattering ride on poor surfaces. The 964 deserves to be lowered 
though 

C4 sits far too high at the front.



the next change was to the air fuel metering, and to change it to

a mass flow sensor. But I sold the car to make way for a holiday of a 

lifetime and a new Porsche upon my return a 993 Turbo 4.



For your interest the 89 964 does have a dual mass flywheel, and this 

was a worry to porsche if i rightly recall, and the part was sourced 

from another manufacturer for the following year. This information was

given in Bruce Andersons' 911 Performance Handbook.



Well this car gave me the biggest grin factor- driving in extreme wet 
conditions was never feared, regularly driving at 120-130 mph in these 
conditions in complete stability, esp. with the later suspension set up + 
wheels.



The downside was the high profile of the car, loved from fellow 
motoring enthusiasts but hated because of the global car crime syndicate.



Colour - I've only seen one 964 in speed yellow, that was a speedster 

at Althorp '97 (the PCGB event).



Well I'm still on holiday, and thanks to cybercafe's everywhere I can 
keep up with  you  all.





TURBO OR NON TURBO

-------------------

If i rightly remember RUF's yellow Bird was in a narrow body, now that 


sounds exciting!!!



best wishes and safe motoring 

Tarik
