Bob,
 In '85 the shaft changed to 108mm diameter flange and
the stub axle was friction welded to the outer CV joint
i.e. there are no bolts on the outer joint.  I just
replaced all the CV joint boots and one joint on my '86
and its no big deal if the joint comes off the shaft
easily. I had to have a friend press one of mine off 
for me and he wound up pressing the outer one off as
well which made things interesting...

Subject: Halfshaft Removal

Recently I decided to replace the CV boots (one is torn) on my 1987 911
Carrera. I have been pondering over how to remove the halfshaft. The Haynes
manual does a decent job of describibg the Nadella  halfshaft removal but I
think that they forgot to update this section of the manual for the Lobro
halfshaft. One of the other PorscheFan members, who has a 1980 911 SC, told
me that he has 6 bolts on either end of the halfshaft. You don't even have to
take the wheel off his car to remove the halfshaft. I have 6 bolts on the
transmission  side but I can not find any  bolts on the other side. I have
searched underneath the car but to no avail.  It appears that the axle nut
has to be removed like the Nadella shaft. (It is EXTREMELY tight). Was there
a change in the Lobro shaft between 1980 and 1987? Can someone help me out?
 TIA.
