Bob:

I don't know if we've spoken before, but if you're willing to come down to
Willow Springs in So. Cal, you're timing couldnt' be better.

I run exactly the event you're seeking, twice a year.  The next one
happens to be on Monday, Sept. 29th.  I've already posted about it on
Pfans, but perhaps you didn't see it (or perhaps you did, and we've
already spoken, and I forgot - if so, I apologize).  Anyway, it's $225 for
the day, everything included, no special equipment, tons of track time,
and many Porsche Owners Club instructors (including me).  If you're
interested, send me an email asap and I'll get you the details.

Does anyone know how I can contact either Porsche Owners Driving
School (as 
mentioned in Vic Elford's book, Porsche Performance Driving) or Track
Time?

I want instruction on how to get the most out of driving my 993, esp on a 
track, but here in Northern CA I haven't found many places that have 911

experts teaching the unique driving advantages/requirements of the 
rear-engined configuration.  I've tracked my car with the local chapters
of 
the Shelby Club and BMW CCA, but their instructors admit that they have
no 
familiarity with rear-engined cars and can only teach me the "normal", 
front-engine lines around Sears Point, Laguna Seca, and other local
tracks.

The local Golden Gate Region of PCA, on the other hand, has no Driver's
Ed 
series and only a Time Trial series.  Being a competition series, they 
require 5-pt harness, fire bottle, and other mods that I don't want to do 
to my new car.  I've mentioned to GGR that the East Coast regions have
DE 
series that only require stock safety equipment, but I've been told no we 
don't do that.  I've also mentioned that I am willing to skip the timed 
sessions if I can attend the rest of the weekend with my stock seatbelt
and 
SA95 helmet, but no we don't allow that either.

I've checked with the neighboring PCA regions, LPR, Diablo, SVR,
Redwood, 
but they are apparently too small to put on track events so they all attend 
GGR's TT series.  Kinda sad that the one local source of 911 driving 
experts won't accomodate those who don't want to mod their cars to
compete, 
who only want to drive their stock cars better.

TIA for any contact info you can provide,
Bob
