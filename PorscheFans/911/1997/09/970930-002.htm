Hi Guys !!

Need some info on the oil gauge.

I have a 1979 930 that I came over to the US and bought and then
exported to Australia.
I notice that when I start my car in the mornings the oil gauge reads in
the red. I drive the car for say about 4-5 miles and then the gauge
starts registering oil in the oil tank. I have also noticed that the
gauge fluctuates madly up and down the white section of the gauge and it
seems to drop when the car is under acceleration. The oil pressure goes
up and the oil level gauge goes down. It sometiomes actual makes it into
the red for a split second or two. When I stop at the lights the oil
level gauge will sit in the middle of the gauge quite happily. Sometimes
if I encounter heavy traffic and it takes me over 30mins. to get to work
I can expect the gauge to be showing in the top quarter for oil level. I
have checked my oil at idle and on a flat surface and it seems fine. The
only dilemma I have with checking the oil is that I feel that maybe oil
is running or being smeared down the dipstick when I pull it out and
thus indicating oil in the tank. If anyone has any clues they would be
greatly appreciated, I have become paranoid now that I have no oil in
the engine...... 

Another question while we are on oil what type of oil should I use in
this car and when the car is idling lets say at 900-1000 rpm what should
the oil pressure read.

One more question, sorry about this but it just happened to me today.
Drove the car home from work, not a problem, being a fine night I
thought I would go out for a drive(the car sat idle for 30mins. I get
back in the car and there is a rubbing noise when I turn the steering
wheel, it seems to be the hard casing plastic rubbing against each
other. Can this be and what would cause something like this ???

Thanks In Anticipation.
