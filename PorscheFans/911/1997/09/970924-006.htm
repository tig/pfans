Bummer.  I just got my 911 back from the frame shop (bent front end due to
off-track excursion; updated front spoiler/valance, too) and it seems that
my transmission has gone south.  First and second have always been a little
hard to get into at times, but I have heard on this list that that is
somewhat normal.  The big problem is with third.  I thought that maybe it
was me due to having been driving a different 5-speed and missing the gate,
but the problem has reoccurred enough that I believe it is the
transmission.  Anyway, when I attempt to shift into third, I get one of
three responses: grinding, rubbing, or third gear.  Major bummer since
driver's ed. at Hallett is this October 4 and 5.  Also major bummer since
it could have been the frame shop screwing it up.  

So, what should a transmission rebuild cost me assuming that it will be a
complete rebuild (might as well)?  Any other advice?  Thanks.
