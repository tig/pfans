                                  MEMORANDUM
         
         From:     Senator Quentin L. Kopp
         
         To:       Supporters of SB 42
         
         Subject:  Status of SB 42		
         
         	I am pleased to report to the many supporters of SB 42 
         that the bill was approved by the Assembly Appropriations 
         Committee on September 4, 1997 on a 20-1 vote.  The bill now 
         proceeds to the Assembly Floor for a vote by the full Assembly; 
         this will occur as early as Monday, September 8, 1997.
         
         	The Assembly Appropriations Committee adopted amendments 
         to SB 42 which would freeze the 25 model year and older smog 
         check exemption for five years, at which time the exemption 
         would become a "rolling" 30-year exemption.  In other words, the 
         bill's provisions would move the current 1965 exemption year 
         cutoff forward to 1973 and maintain that exemption year until 
         2003.  The amendments were promulgated by the committee as 
         changes necessary to move the bill to the Assembly Floor. 
         Obviously, I prefer the previous version of the bill.  
         Notwithstanding the amendments, passage of the bill represents a 
         substantial victory for those backing the bill.
         
         	I urge you to continue to convey your support to your 
         respective representatives in the Assembly and inform Governor 
         Wilson of your views.  We are one step closer, and a large one 
         at that, to securing the relief embodied in SB 42.  Thank you 
         again for all you have done and are doing. >>
