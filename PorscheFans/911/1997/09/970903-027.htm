"I could get it fire up immediately after running; but only if it set for 5+
minutes."   -??? I assume you mean that immediately after turning the 
engine off, it would start.  However, if you leave it for >5minutes, it won't
start until it is close to stone cold?  If so read on.

I think that somehow you are not holding residual pressure.  One way to
check is to take off air cleaner, and lift up on the air metering lever with
the 
ignition on for a few seconds.  The fule pump should run.  Now, try starting
the car; I bet it will start.

These CIS vintage vehicles rely on the system to hold residual pressure
in order to start; the fuel pump doesn't begin to run until the engine has
caught
and is able to pull enuf air to lift the air metering flap and switch on the
pump.

You have replaced the standard items; only other things I can think of  are
the
fuel distributor or (maybe) the check valve on the fuel pump ( I think your 
vintage car has one).

(reply to:)

I have a 1980 911SC that doesn't fire up when hot. There is no simtoms of
problems when cold.

Though I have checked that there are sparks at the plugs and there is fuel
pumping through the filter when this problem occurs.

Since this I have replaced 'warm up regulator' and 'auxilary air valve'.

I have eliminate the possibility of the 'ignition module' since there are
sparks; and I have also tested with another coil.

What else could I diagnois and can go wrong when it gets hot.

One more note:
I could get it fire up immediately after running; but only if it set for 5+
minutes. And also it runs fine as long as I don't shut it off.

Help!!!!!
