This may or may not be your problem, but here's my standard email
about this subject.

I've had this exact problem.  I either had inconsistent and
unpredictable
intermittent and/or parking, or sometimes neither at all.  It turned out
to
be the wiper relay.  The relay was not really broken, the internal
contacts
were simply corroded.
 
At this point, I'll qualify my answer with "In my car - '87 911 ... If I
remember correctly ...".  Having said that, the wiper relay is a
rectangular
black plastic case about 2 inches long, and about 1" square.  The relay
is
mounted to the firewall on the passenger side of the wiper motor in the
"behind the ducting, infront of the firewall, under the
windshield/dashboard,
ABYSS" accessible by removing the speedometer and reaching through. 
Other
people have reported accessing it from the bonnet area by removing some
of the A/C-heat ducting etc...  I removed the relay, pryed it open, and
filed the contacts. Works like new now.  If you simply want to replace
the
relay, I think they're $50.

Keep Porsching,
