I think this list has gotten a little dull. Here's a piece which I 
wrote for the local PCA magazine.  Maybe it will lighten things up a 
bit. The original appeared in Der Auspuff of the Rennsport Region of 
PCA in my monthly column and is copyrighted for reproduction in 
print.

          Porsche 4 x 4 again?

          The new Mercedes 4 x 4 is already a success. Apparently there are
          three year waiting lists for their sport-utility vehicle.  As
          most of us know, Porsche was contemplating making a deal to sell
          a modified version of the Mercedes ML-320 badged as a Porsche.
          Apparently the deal broke down perhaps because M-B figured they'd
          sell all they could make without any help from Porsche
          thank-you-very-much. 

          With demand for the Benz-ute outstripping supply and what seems
          to be an ever growing market segment, Porsche is taking a second
          look at the idea of a Porsche-ute. Since the whole world is going
          nuts over SUV's,  I figured I'd have a whack at what it 
          might be like.
