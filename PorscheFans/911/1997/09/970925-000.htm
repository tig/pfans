Absolutely not!  You can buy a rebuilt transmission outright and have it
installed for about half of that!  Get away from that dealer (the techs
probably have no idea how to rebuild a 1978 transmission anyway) and
take your car to a reputable independent Porsche specialist.  Another
option is to order a rebuilt transmission using yours as a core, from
one of the well-established companies like Aase brothers.  That's 
probably what I would do.

Bruce Anderson says that you can gain about 20 horsepower on a 911SC
by replacing the exhaust with an early style (1974 or earlier) exhaust
system (heat exchangers and muffler).  Apparently this requires some
modifications to the oil lines also.  He also says that the twin pipe
sport muffler is significantly better than the stock muffler.  However
I can tell you that my 2.7 has headers and a sport muffler and it is
quite loud.
 
Of course you can dispense with heat exchangers altogether and use
headers.  You will have no heat, however, if you do that.  As for
brands, I like B&B fabrication because their exhausts look so pretty.
They are expensive though.
 
Hope this information helps.
