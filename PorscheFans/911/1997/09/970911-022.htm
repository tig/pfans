JP essentially, there are two types of P' drivers:   Those that wave,
and those that don't.

But to help you out as to when to "expect" a return wave (and lessen
your frustration), here are the following guidelines (based on current
ownership of two 911s and one 944 T and 6 previous and various P'car
models :-)

1-  The newer the 911, the greater increase of waving frequency and
frenzy (unless its "brand" new, then see # 5 below for details)

2-  In the older 911, waves are typically only exhibited by pre-89 911's
drivers. (Maybe a slight change of body style has the "wavee"
temporarily confused as to the car's origin)

3-  While driving a 911, never, I mean NEVER, wave to a non-911 owner
(including a 924, a 944, a 928 or a 914) (This rule is written somewhere
in the 911 owners manual - page 162, paragraph 2, I think.  It is
omitted from any of the other models manual altogether, so they don't
know why their snubbed...)

4-  While driving a 944, only wave to other 944's - do not acknowledge
the existence of 924's or 914's. You can only hope that a 911 driver
will even notice your car so they don't hit it.  Any other "eye contact"
is purely coincidental...

5-  Brand new Porsche owners of brand new 911's NEVER wave (Either
haven't read the Owners manual about "Waving Etiquette",  can't read, or
are shocked by having someone wave at them just to "wave" (remember,
these folks came from a different marquee...)

Big Grin...

John
Model - Annual Wave Average - Specifications
87 911 - .500 Wave Average - Carrera
70 911 .100 Wave Average -  w/3.2, MAF, 915, RS look (I just blow the
non-wavers away...)
86 951 - .001 Wave Average with 911's, .250 Wave Average with other
944's

for reference purposes, I'll list my previous averages as well:
80 931 (924 Turbo) - .000 Wave Average with 911's, .100 Wave Average
with all other P car's
72 914 - .000 Wave Average with 911's, .000 Wave Average with all other
P car's

Remember, these figures are estimates only. Actual Wave Averages may
vary.
