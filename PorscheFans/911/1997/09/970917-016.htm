This subject was on the list on March 21st, so I'll copy my reply with a
small
correction Bob Spindel made:

        ----- from March 21st ----

  Interesting question!
  I replaced mine with an universal O2 sensor, about 35USD, and have =

  frankly no idea if it is working properly or not. My old one was bad, =

  but it was because I had other problems that I corrected, hence I =

  can't compare before / after changing it. I don't think this qualify as=

  a test, but it passed the Florida "smog check".   =

  The generic O2 sensor I bought for my -85 911 even had the same =

  shape, so I could use the original shield. Perfect fit.

  Anyhow I bought also a generic 4-wire O2 sensor for my SO =

  Dodge Caravan after the "computer" told the old one was bad.
  The "computer" accepted this generic O2 sensor.

  To my understanding an O2 sensor is just an O2 sensor, nothing
  else. Porsche is using Bosch sensors and these should also be
  available as generic versions, witch mean You have to use the
  old plug. I just couldn't find then a Bosch 3-wire sensor.

  You can pretty easily check the O2 sensor, stuff needed:
  - High impedance (10Mohm) digital multimeter that is capable
    of measuring millivolts DC, (below 1V). =

  - Propane torch
  - Pliers

  How it is done:
  - Connect the multimeter to sensor, one lead to the output lead of
    O2 sensor. My -85 use a 3-wire sensor, there is two plugs, one =

    2-wire for the heating and one single wire for output.
    The other lead to sensor body, eg. ground.
  - Hold the O2 sensor with pliers and heat the tip so it turn "red"
  - Observe the multimeter reading, if the reading is somewhere above
    600millivolts and changes quickly when the flame is moved over =

    the tip Your sensor should be OK. Voltage should change quickly.

  If Your O2 sensor has high miles, propably You should change it,
  it is one of those parts that fade away.

  I have been told that normal table salt will destroy the O2 sensor, =

  so have the chips after You're done.  =

 =

  Don't forget the O2 sensor safe anti-seize!

  Just a side note, You can check the cat converter by measuring the
  temp before and after, if after higher, about 100F, if I remember right=
,
  the cat is working.

  I'm writing these from my memory and because of this, proceed with
  extreme caution.

The part about "low impedance voltmeter" I deleted from my original
message.

Sorry for the long posting.


PS to Ross Parker:
Congrats about the new car. =

Perhaps this is something You wish to add to the FAQ list?
