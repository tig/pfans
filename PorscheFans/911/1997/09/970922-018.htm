Rick,

You mentioned that you're getting a spark, but what about fuel?  Do
you smell fuel from the exhaust?  In other words, is it starved or
flooded?

I once had a problem where the O2 sensor was bad.  It resulted in
a false reading to the DME effectively saying 'Gimme more fuel'.
The net result was a flooded engine which would crank, but not
start.

Another time I had a problem when the fuel pump would not go.  The
cause was a failed DME relay which shut the system down.  In this
case, I had crank and spark, but no fuel and thus no fire.

So, a few suggestions for you:
- DME relay
- Oxygen sensor

Those are just 2 of my personal experiences.  But neither one of
them cause my car to shut down.  They only manifested in a failure
to re-start.  Let us know what you find.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
