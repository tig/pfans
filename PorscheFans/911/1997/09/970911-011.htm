Not having heard the Gold Chain thread, it does sound typical of a small
proportion of Porsche owners. By the way, back when I was Adam Seitz's
age, there were a number of 356 owners who exhibited the same behavior,
even at Riverside. 

Adam, two pieces of advice:
1) It is possible to get a 911SC at a reasonable price. See Bruce
Anderson's pricing articles in Excellence. If you do your own work, not
only will you save $$, you'll know far more about your vehicle than the
"Gold Chain" crowd.

2) when you do acquire your Porsche (of any vintage) and it is admired
by anyone of school age, your first reply should be "See what good
grades will get you". Believe me, a 911 is the greatest motivator for an
educated citizenship <g>
