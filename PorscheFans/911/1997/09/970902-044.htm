I have no idea where the epoxy rumor is coming from. Weltmeister has never
manufactured a short shift lever that uses epoxy or requires the user to do
it. The shift lever and ball are welded chrome-moly.

Anybody selling a kit that is represented as Weltmeister but uses epoxy is
counterfeit. Automotion would like very much to see this epoxied kit.

To our knowledge, the only epoxied short shift kit on the market is made by
a company called Target.

I work with Automotion, and have many years experience with a variety of
Weltmeister products, even providing r&d feedback on prototypes. I most
recently installed their short shift kit and sway bars in my time trial
911. The only problem I have ever had with one of their products is with
the reverse lock-out I could not install in my 1972 shift tower.
