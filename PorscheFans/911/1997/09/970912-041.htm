In days of yore Porsche owners blinked their headlights at each other.
There were VERY FEW of us on the road, and it was a great feeling seeing
another rear engined sports car and saying Hi!  That's why the high beam/low
beam lever allows one to "blink" the high beams without the headlight switch
on! I think.:^)  Anyway, I'm still driving my four cylinder, and I'll blink
at any Porsche capable of blinking back.  I get a lot of "What does that
mean?" looks from owners of newer Porsches, as in "What the *#@ is that
??Volkswagen?? driver doing blinking his lights at me?"  A lot of 911
owners, however, obviously know the history of our cars, and they blink AND
wave at me.  The instant comraderie is a positive addition to life's little
pleasures.  Oh, one more thing:  If you want to have fun driving a Porsche,
get all sorts of positive attention, with NONE of the negative attention a
newer model can attract,  buy a 356!  OK, so I don't have air, but I DO have
vent windows.:-)
