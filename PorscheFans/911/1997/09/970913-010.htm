Yet even more on an old thread:
	I, too, have sadly noted the passing of the traditional wave. 
	I have had my '81 SC for 12 years, and when I first got her, it seemed like 
most other air cooled owners would wave, or blink headlamps. I always 
acknowledged the others, whether 911's or lesser creatures, and blinked at 
other 911's who did not initiate contact. Most responded, except some of the 
ladies, who perhaps flattered themselves as to my motivation....
	Today, nobody waves or blinks, with few exceptions.It seems that owners of 
the late models don't, perhaps feeling snobby about my (still looks good) 
fifteen+ year old buggy? In days past, older Porsches were venerated by newer 
car owners. Today, it seems like an SC or 911T or 356 owner might acknowledge 
back, but the new car guys almost never do. 
	I admit to contributing to the decline recently by not bothering myself, 
except in rare instances. On the whole, this is really too bad, because, as 
this List proves, there is still a considerable sense of community among 
owners of the Marque.
	So, let's see if we can revive the practice? The acknowledgement of other 
cars and by their owners has long been one of the many joys of Porsche 
ownership. Personally, I will even go so far as to reply to the owner of a 
(choke and gag!) water cooled model. 
	By the way, don't water cooled cylinder heads somehow "dilute" the purity of 
the 911 breed?
	On another note, at a red light recently, the driver of a Ford Explorer  told 
me a joke so old I had forgotten it... "What is the difference between a 
Porsche and a porcupine? The porcupine has its prick(s) on the outside."
