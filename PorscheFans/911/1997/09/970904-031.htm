Bradley,
The two references I could find in the Porsche C2/C4 shop manual refer
to the brake bleeding machine pressures as "approx. 1.5bar" (22psi) for
the C4 procedure and "approx. 2 bar" (29psi) for the C2.  I don't know
if these apply to the earlier 911's (<MY90) as the reservoir designs may
be different.  I leave it to you to determine what Porsche means by
"approx.":^)  .
