1.  I would like to entirely replace my brake fluid (Castrol GLMA) with
ATE
Super Blue.  On the newer Porsche's, however, one needs a handheld
computer to release the solenoid/hydraulic valve to bleed the integrated

clutch/brake hydraulic system.  Is there any other way to do this?  ...

To: Chris c/o Walt
I have run into this problem changing the fluid in my C4.  However, if I
read your note correctly you have a C2 and your power booster is vaccuum
not the electro-hydraulic found in the C4 and turbo.  So, if all you are
doing is the brakes and clutch, you can use the old method pressurizing
the reservoir and bleeding each wheel.  This is described in the
workshop manual.  I do this on my C4, and switch between ATE 200
(yellow) to Super Blue yearly at home.  The full system flush of the All
Wheel Drive requires the computer and gets done at the dealer every
other year.  I too cannot justify a 9288 Bosch wonder computer for a
once a year job.

My search has lead to believing these things are pretty rare outside of
the dealer network.  If someone responds with an alternative to the
9288, please let me know.  TIA.
