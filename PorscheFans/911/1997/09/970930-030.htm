windshield and rear glass. I would prefer the flat black look, and I am
considering painting these pieces. Is this doable? I'd like to paint the
chrome headlight rings too.

In 89 I repainted my 77 (after flaring it) and took all the chrome trim parts
to a powdercoater.  Has worked pretty well.  Just this year the black has
started coming off of the flat pieces on the top of the door panel (where
your arm might rest with window open ), and where it has been knicked
a bit of silver shows through elsewhere.  Otherwise, all is well, and it
doesn't look like the faded anodizing the Scs develop.

Powdercoating involves heat, so be sure you only give the metal to be
painted to the coater (I didn't realize the nut caps for the windshield
wipers were plastic until I got it back.  Plus, there are no replacements
for those little gizmos, far as I can tell.)
