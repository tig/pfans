Hello Porschephiles!


To start off, I'd like to introduce myself since I just joined this
list.
My name is Darin Nederhoff and I live in North Central Iowa.  I drive a
1990 Audi Coupe Quattro 20V and an '86 Merkur XR4ti (when it feels
happy).  hehe    I'm an Audi quattro fan at heart, but have always loved
the 911.  My father and I share an enthusiasm for 911's...  the C4 in
particular.

We've never owned a Porsche before...  Audi is as close as we've gotten
so far, but that may change.  For the past few years, my father has been
looking casually for a 911 (1985-1991).   I'm fairly familiar with the
80's cars, but when it comes to the 90's Carrera 4's etc I'm afraid I
don't know enough.

We've located a car in the Minneapolis area and will be going to check
it out in the near future.  Could any of the past or present owners help
me out and tell me what I should look for?  What problems do these cars
have?  Do they require the same typical sacrifices that my Audi
sometimes begs for?  ;-)

Thanks for any pointers you can provide,

Darin
