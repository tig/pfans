Dear Ed,

I am sorry I am late at sending this to you, but I hope late is better than
never.

I too own an '83 911SC, and I too have had similar starting problems. I tried
most everything and it almost drove me crazy. After many fix attempts, I
determined the problem to be with something so simple as a fuse. Yes, believe
it or not, a fuse.

It seems that the fuse for the fuel pump corrodes over the years and when
subjected to heat and or humidity, the fuse no longer carries the appropriate
current for the fuel pump. 

In order to test this theory and prove the soluition was a new fuse, I drove
my 911 with the original fuse until I encountered the problem again. When the
problem popped up, I replaced the fuel pump fuse with a new one and the car
started right up. I then replaced the old fuse and the car would not start.
After letting the original fuse sit overnight, I tried it again and it worked
fine. For me, at least, that marked a problem solved and a solution found to
my starting problem.

My '83 SC has done the exact same thing (no starter after a long hot
drive in the summer)... also twice... also with a random time until it
spontaneously fixes itself.  I have suspected either higher solenoid
resistance due to high temperature, or maybe a mechanical clearance
problem due to temperature.  The heat exchanger outlet hose runs pretty
close up in there (on an SC anyway)... tried insulating it from the
starter/solenoid... got bitten again 50k miles later.  A buddy with a
'78 has also been through a similar round of troubles.
