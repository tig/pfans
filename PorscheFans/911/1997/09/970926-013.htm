82 SC, bled my brakes after track event in prep for a local
autocross using the 2 person method and the order LR,RR,RF,LF.
Not sure if ignition was on while bleeding.  The brake pedal is
now firm and brakes work great but the brake warning light
(RED, looks like {()} on dash by radio) is now "on" whenever
the car is running and won't go off.  I have checked fluid
level, condition of pads/rotors, function of all four calipers,
parking brake etc.  Everything seems fine.  Have bled brakes
many times before w/o this problem, maybe not using same
order.  My experience has been that as long as I bleed both
rears before either front and that I do LF last all is well in
terms of pedal feel.

I read in Haynes that there is a procedure for "testing" that
this light will illuminate.  The procedure is to turn key to
turn on power, crack a bleeder valve on one of the rear
calipers and bleed, then do the same on front caliper and
bleed.  The light should go on.  This suggests to me that the
sensor is probably set up to indicate an imbalance in braking
between the front and rear circuits, perhaps via a pressure
differential at master cylinder.  However Haynes doesn't say
anything about how to turn the light off...

So the question - did I accidentally activate this "test"
feature?  If so, how do I get that thing to turn off?!  If not,
what else should I check?  Where's the "reset" button?
