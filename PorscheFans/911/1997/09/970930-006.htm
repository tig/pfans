Scott,
 I'm using an Ansa with my SSI's. Judging from the weight (heavy), I 
would say that they are similar to the the original Porsche muffler.
The body of the muffler is heavy gauge steel (like the OEM?) and the
muffler tip is stainless though you wouldn't know it to look at it.
I think it will last as long as the original, maybe longer.
  For SSI's,you need a muffler that fits a '74 911. The 1974 model was 
the only year with a dual inlet muffler AND big bumper. I don't believe 
the Borla makes a muffler to fit the '74. Be prepared for it to be a 
little loud - sort of like a muscle car.

 Chris
