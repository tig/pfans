I'm with Jay.  Sure there are reasons to have a SUC (Sport Utility Car) but 
only if you live in an area where you go off road or have snow.  A minivan 
is alot more practical otherwise - and generally uses alot less dead 
dinosaurs.    However a SUC is much more macho.   How else could you justify 
the fact that 90% of them are driven - usually badly - by one person.   
Recently there was a study that concluded that Americans were driving much 
more aggresively with a significantly increased number of accidents 
resulting from sheer macho.   That study put some of the blame squarely on 
the increased number of SUX (multiple SUC's).   If you think you have it bad 
with P cars try riding a motorcycle around SUX.

For what its worth. . . . .
