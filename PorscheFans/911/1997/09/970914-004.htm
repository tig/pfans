Hello Phans,

Since I'll have to get 4 fresh rotors on my '87 coupe pretty soon, I'm
thinking of upgrading the brakes (rotors, calipers, pads, the whole
package).
I would prefer to keep my 16" fuchs on the car, so I guess 964 breaks would
be best because I understood that the 'big reds' only fit 17" and bigger
wheels (please correct me if I'm wrong).
I wanna ask what modifications will have to be made to install/fit these
brake's (brake cylinder, brakelines, whatever? - I'm pretty much in the
dark here).
Hmmmm... how about the break performance to be expected from this upgrade
to the 964 brakes, because although I am a sucker for the 'Porsche'
calipers, I'm not willing to spend big $ for squat (if you know what I
mean).
I'm planning to call/visit some P-techs and ask about this modification for
info and a price quote (how much should I approx. be counting for: parts,
labor). I wanna be prepared and ask as much of the right questions as
possible to find out if they know what they're talking about ('cause I sure
ain't)... so, any thoughts and info are greatly appreciated!
TIA

PS, about the 911 decomposing to a Boxter after not driving it fast
enough... I guess the engineers in Stuttgart didn't drive it as they were
supposed to, 'cause in a way it already did. Yep, a nightmare to come true

I guess be better take extra good care of our air-cooled little monsters to
prevent total extinction...
