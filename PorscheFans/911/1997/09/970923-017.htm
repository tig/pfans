Hi All,
   Frankly, I am suprised by the attitude expressed by by some 
of the regional hierarchy (ie GGR) with regards to PCA's Driver 
Education program.  Really, six wrecks per weekend?  You must 
have pretty bad instructors at those events.
   I've been instructing for most regions in the east, Track 
Time, etc. for quite a few years and have never heard of such 
carnage.  The Driver's Ed program is one of the best programs 
in the world for bringing up good drivers and for safely 
letting new Porsche drivers gain familiarity with their cars.  
   It is up to the instructors and the organizers to run a safe 
event.  The emphasis in Driver's Ed. is properly placed more on 
learning technique than on speed as in timed events.
   Often, a beginning student does not have the knowledge to 
properly choose safety equipment; or even the awareness of what 
is available or needed.  In such a case, it is the 
responsibility of the instructor to control the pace of the car 
and the pace of the learning in a safe manner.  The best place 
to learn what you need is from your fellow participants and 
instructors.
   I manufacture the Brey-Krause products so I have an interest 
in selling safety equipment.  I am also a great believer in the 
Driver's Ed program and believe in encouraging new (and 
experienced) Porsche drivers to learn about their cars in a 
safe non-competitive environment.  How often on this list do we 
hear about the new Boxter/911/951 owner who just went 120mph 
for the first time and got sideways on a off ramp?
   Time trials are great, but Driver's Ed might save that guy's 
life.

Sorry for the soap-box,
Dodge
