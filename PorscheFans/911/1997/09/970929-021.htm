    I have dealt with Vision Motorsports as Dwayne did most of the work on my
car when I was out there. If I was still out there I would still use his shop
and have even considered shipping or driving my car out for him to do a
rollcage/suspension upgrade, but currently lack the funds.
   I think Dwayne worked at Andial before he opened his own shop. He is the
maker of the quick steering racks sold by Vision and Automotion. They are
replicas of the factory racks installed in some rally race cars. As far as I
know the factory part is no longer available.
   He also makes the Kokeln headers for 930's that are really nice stainless
construction. He used to do some normal maintainence on some customer's cars,
but demand for his business was so great he only does track cars now.
    He's pretty busy and it's still race season. Good luck catching him. 
My .02 worth IMOHO and YMMV,
