From my experience I would suggest the following:

1) '86 serial number should be like WPOxxx91xGxxxxxxx where "x" depends
on country shipped to and "G" stands for an '86.  Your serial no. has a "8"
in fourth digit, indicating a '78 (my '76 911 serial no. was 9116201918)

2) Factory Turbo-looks had the 930 big brakes (vented drilled rotors, 4
piston
calipers front and rear of same size).  Rear calipers are mounted behind the 
wheel center, rather than in front like on standard 911.

3) Have dealer go over body work, or else you can do it with a plastic
magnet.
There should not be any plastic Bondo around the big fenders (factory fenders
in '86 were welded up with no filler).

Don't have info on engine nos., but '78 used CIS fuel injection (can tell by
air
filter housing stretching across engine with air inlet on left side), '86
used
Motronic fuel injection ( air filter/inlet should be on far right side of
engine;
brain box for FI should be under left front seat - at least it is on US
cars).

I agree with dealer; car is a fake.  I don't remember the widebody being a 
factory option till '84.

 Porschefans please help,
 
 I'm about to make the jump into Porsche ownership and among several cars
under
 consideration is what looks like an 86 widebody 911 coupe, guards red,
 sunroof, tan leather interior, electric seats, the works!
 
 The dealer tells me that it is actually a '78 SC which has an 86 interior
and
 an '84 3.2litre engine.  He was caught out by a wholesaler from whom he
bought
 the car sight unseen as an 86 widebody.  The car is definitely an import
into
 Australia so I seek the help of Porschefans to verify what they are telling
 me.
 
 The Engine # is:  64G01200 
 Chassis # is:  9118201732
 
 My questions are:-
 1)  is this a '78 SC "done up", in which case is the widebody aftermarket?
 2)  what year is the engine and what is it's capacity and horsepower?
 3)  is there anything I should look for to check if the car has been built
 properly.
 
 Normally I wouldn't consider buying a car with such a checkered history and
 the other cars I am looking at are 81/82 SC's with original everything but
 this thing just looks a million dollars and there is a possibility of
picking
 it up for a bargain because the dealer got stung so your help would be
 appreciated.
 
 Thanks in advance
