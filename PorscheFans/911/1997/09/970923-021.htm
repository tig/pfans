Reread the post.  He was referring to another for profit organization that 
advertises Drivers Schools to the general public in California. 
 
"Time trials are great, but Driver's Ed might save that guy's  
life." 
 
A first timer coming into the GGR time trial series goes thru orientation
and 
enters the instruction phase.  IT IS DRIVERS ED!!! 
 
I was at a Club Race that incorporated a DRIVERS ED into the Club Race
weekend 
with a separate run group. This was in another region, far away from GGR and=
 
Zone 7.  My SO was signed up for DE.  She's driven with GGR TT series once
and 
had expectations that another region would have the same quality DE program.=
 
She's also had other on track instruction and has the basics down. She was 
assigned an instructor at the drivers meeting.  I brought the car to grid as
I 
was straight off the track from a race group practice session where she was 
waiting with the "instructor".  He asked if he could drive for the first 2 
laps as he had never driven that track before.  She seemed ok with it but I 
was reluctant....red flags were starting to wave in the breeze of 
bullshit.....He drove.....for the entire session.  When they came in I 
suggested he was supposed to be an instructor-not a bleeping chaffeur and
told 
him not to come back.  Turns out not only had he never driven there before
but 
he had never instructed before and couldn't sort out a line if his life 
depended on it.  I talked to the organizers and became her instructor for
the 
rest of the weekend.  They had no real formal DE set up for that weekend but=
 
were doing it on the fly so to speak.  Some program..... 
 
So, don't be so quick to criticize the GGR program.  I'm sure Drivers Ed
with 
PCA varies greatly from region to region and I've experienced one of the not=
 
so good programs first hand.  
 
I've even recommended the GGR program over Bondurant and Russell schools.  
Once again, so listers don't get confused by your post....the GGR program is=
 
safe, well organized, high quality instruction at your own pace........

Hi All,
   Frankly, I am suprised by the attitude expressed by by some 
of the regional hierarchy (ie GGR) with regards to PCA's Driver 
Education program.  Really, six wrecks per weekend?  You must 
have pretty bad instructors at those events.
   I've been instructing for most regions in the east, Track 
Time, etc. for quite a few years and have never heard of such 
carnage.  The Driver's Ed program is one of the best programs 
in the world for bringing up good drivers and for safely 
letting new Porsche drivers gain familiarity with their cars.  
   It is up to the instructors and the organizers to run a safe 
event.  The emphasis in Driver's Ed. is properly placed more on 
learning technique than on speed as in timed events.
   Often, a beginning student does not have the knowledge to 
properly choose safety equipment; or even the awareness of what 
is available or needed.  In such a case, it is the 
responsibility of the instructor to control the pace of the car 
and the pace of the learning in a safe manner.  The best place 
to learn what you need is from your fellow participants and 
instructors.
   I manufacture the Brey-Krause products so I have an interest 
in selling safety equipment.  I am also a great believer in the 
Driver's Ed program and believe in encouraging new (and 
experienced) Porsche drivers to learn about their cars in a 
safe non-competitive environment.  How often on this list do we 
hear about the new Boxter/911/951 owner who just went 120mph 
for the first time and got sideways on a off ramp?
   Time trials are great, but Driver's Ed might save that guy's 
life.

Sorry for the soap-box,
Dodge
