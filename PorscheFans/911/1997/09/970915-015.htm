LUBOW, reporting the sudden death of his 911, said:

>Well, despite my best preparations, I was left by the side of the road
yesterday, on my way >to Snowmass.  After nearly 3 years my '75 911S Targa

<<SNIP>>

> What ELSE can go wrong to leave you by the side of the road?  

The very same thing happened to me seven years ago, shortly after I bought
my 911.  It turned out to be a simple thing: a bit of dirt on the contact
faces of the breaker points.  Stuck a piece of a business card between them,
and pulled it back and forth to clean the the faces.  

The problem is caused by the fact that the Permatune module does not pass
much current through the points, so it is fairly easy for a bit of
contamination to build up.  Having said this, I've never had a recurrence of
the problem.  (Now, just wait ...) 

If your points are new, it is quite posssible that the contact faces have
some preservative residue on them, and may require some solvent to clean
them adequately..

Hope this helps,
