I have experienced something similar when I was shopping around for my
car I went to one dealer and asked a few basic questions, I knew how
much I could spend and what year I was looking at but the dealer, a
pompous ass, would hardly answer any questions and first wanted me to
buy a book he was selling and only then would he speak to me, his
patronizing attitude really pissed me off. So I went to another dealer
and I ended up after a return visit buying the car from him. You get
good people and bad people. 

On a similar note do you (meaning listers) wave to other Porsche
drivers? I have a '57 British MGA roadster and when driving that any
classic car drivers waves plus those driving plastic (new modern cars)
but in the Porsche most other Porsche drivers don't wave back.
?

Close your eyes and press escape three times.

'57 MGA
'68 Porsche 911T
