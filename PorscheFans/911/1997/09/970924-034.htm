Mark - I just purchased a Bosch distributor to replace my Marelli for my
2.2.  It's actually from a 72 2.4 that has been rebuilt and machined by
Motor Meister to work in a 2.2  It came with the vacuum advance
mechanism and based on my inspection, it looks like it was designed to
RETARD the advance, so I don't plan to hook it up.  I'm sure someone on
the list can confirm or deny this.

>>I own a '72s which was converted to carbs by the PO.  I have recently
installed a new distributor because the old one was worn out.  I would
like to know where or how I can obtain a intake vacuum source.  The
intake manifolds have a casting depression over the #2 and #4 cylinders,
and one these I drilled out only to discover that a pulsing vacuum
source is located here.  Duh,  I would have realized this had I thought
at all about it first, the valve opens=vacuum,  valve close, etc.  Is
there a way to hook up the vacuum with carbs and K+N filters(i.e. no air
cleaner air box)?  The reason that I would like to do this is to obtain
~35 degrees at 6000 rpm, without setting the timing beyond TDC at 900
rpm.>>
