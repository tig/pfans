**********  Eli's Message follows  ***********>>

>I am in the process of looking for an '82-'87 911 Targa and I find myself
>in the unique (I think) position of adamantly wanting a car *without* a
>whale tail.  It seems that very few of the 911s sold in the "if you've got
>it, flaunt it" 80's were ordered au naturale(sp?).
>
>To that end, I'd like to know what the collected PorscheFans wisdom has to
>say about removing the tail altogether and replacing it with the standard
>rear lid/panel.  Furthermore, I'd like to know what other body
>modifications are usually found with the whale tail.  Front spoilers?  Does
>the tail only come with the "Turbo Look" option?  What is the "Turbo Look"
>option?  Again, I love the clean lines of the unmodified car, and I want my
>car to look as "classic 911" as possible.
>
>My specific questions are:
>  -  Has anyone done this (removed the tail)?
>  -  About how much would it cost?
>  -  Is it difficult to find a replacement panel as I've described?
>  -  What would this do to the resale value?
>  -  Are there any model years on which this operation would be
>significantly easier?  More difficult?
>
>While I'm at it, why don't I tell you all what I'm looking for:
>
>  -  1982-87 911 Targa (model years are somewhat arbitrary and flexible)
>  -  No whale tail or other body mods
>  -  A *color* other than bright red.  No black, white, silver, or bright
>red.
>  -  A (reasonably) reliable daily driver.  No project cars, race cars, or
>show cars
>  -  No turbo.  I don't need it, so why pay extra for it?
>  -  A price tag in the high teens or low twenties
>
>I realize I'm being pretty picky, but there's no sense in buying what I
>don't want, right?
>
>I'm located in Austin, Texas, so it would be great if I didn't have to
>travel any further than Houston, Dallas, or San Antonio.  Any Lone Star or
>Maverick PCA'ers listening?
>
>If you think you may have what I want, or know someone who might, please
>write me email at
>eli.leland@trilogy.com or leave me a message at (512) 476-7316.
>
>Thanks in advance for your advice and help in my search.  Love the list.
