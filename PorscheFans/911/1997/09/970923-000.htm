Well folks the more I get into this historic racing deal in Australia
the more I find out.  It's starting to look like I will have an early
911 that will be eligable for a couple of classes but I will have to use
more than one engine.

Aside from the 2.5 ltr short stroke engine (which the list has given me
some fantastic information and contacts on) I am also interested in the
2.3 ltr ST engine.  If I want to run a true ST engine (type 911/20
911/22) I need to be able to get hold of copies of original homologation
papers (and parts list for that car).  I would really appreciate any
help with this because if I can find these factory endorsed specs the
ruling body here in Australia may actually allow me to run a true
replica of a 911 / ST GT  all 230 HP, fender flares, lightweight hood,
engine cover etc.  This would be a great thing.  I know I have seen a
picture of an ST / GT that actually lives in the US.  It was featured in
the 'Le Mans Porsche' book and is done up in it's Monte Carlo rally
livery (with driving lights etc)  Unfortuneately I don't have a copy of
that publication so I don't know who the owner is.  

As always, any help with this will be greatly appreciated.

Azim
