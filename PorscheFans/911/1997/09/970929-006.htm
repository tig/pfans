David,

The Litronic system uses a xenon gas discharge bulb fed by a high voltage
power supply. It allows more light for a given size headlamp, with less
power consumption. The 35 watt "D2S" bulb puts out twice as much light as
an H1 bulb, and has a higher color temperature (4200 K ) so the light has
more green & blue than a halogen bulb system. I don't really like the color
of the light, but thats just a personal thing. Supposedly there is better
control of the beam pattern, too.

Interestingly, they generate a lot of UV light, which is filtered out at
the headlamp. I have seen discussion of taking advantage of UV light to
improve the visibility of pedestrians and other important roadside objects
at night. Since most detergents have 'whiteners' that fluoresce under long
wave ultraviolet, people wearing so treated clothing would be 'brighter'.
