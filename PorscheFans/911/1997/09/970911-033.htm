If you've installed a chip, please advise on your experiences.

The AutoThority chip showed up today.  The instructions make it sound easy
-- although, absurdly the instructions are written for several different
cars and so the narrative swaps between (entirely) different vehicles
mid-way through vital stages (like pulling printed circuit boards off
connectors or oriented the chip!) so it's a little disconcerting.

In fifteen years of building my own computers (some worth 500 bucks, some
with 500 thousand bucks for customers) I've never killed anything
(expensive) with static electricity, but there's always a first time.  Cars
are one big static box on prodigious insulators, so me kneeling next to the
car and touching the box makes for a unique circumstance to cause static
arcs.  Oh well, it's only $400, a pity they don't include a $1 anti-static
ground strap.

So tonight I'll redo my performance figures (standing start, quarter mile
and rolling splits) and after the chip is in and the engine is tuned, I'll
redo the tests and see what the gain (hopefully) nets.

Cheers
