Alan,

I think it was I that had started the valve adjustment string and posted my
experience to the group.  I was always contemplating to do the
adjustment/clearance check myself.  It is quite redundant (once you do the
first, the rest are really all the same) on a 3.2L.

The PorscheFans WWW site has an archival list, however, I'm not certain of
the exact location.  I know I had completed the adjustment in
February/March.  I documented my step by step process of what was involved.
 If you have difficulty in finding this information, and the other members
can't recommend or provide its location I can re-post the process if you
like.  

This list is a great resource, and I appreciate the help I received prior
to attempting the process, so I will repost if you require it.
