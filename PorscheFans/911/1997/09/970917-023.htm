I think most of the folks on Pfans will be the sort of people that use a
vehicle for what it was intended for.

That being said, I live in the mountains west of Denver and I think I know
the people that are being skewered on the site.

My neighbors all have Explorers/Expeditions/Blazers/Suburbans, etc. 
They all got them so "they won't be trapped when it snows".  Oddly
enough, when it snows, they stay home trapped because they are
incompetent drivers and/or these vehicles are the first to go into the ditch
(perhaps because of the first item.)  The muddiest these get is when
they drop their kids off at a friend's house on an unpaved road.

Enough ranting.  I have to admit I'm looking for a used S10 Blazer with the
Vortec engine to tow the 911 to the track and as a daily driver.  I promise
to go four wheeling in the high country with it.

1967 911 with S engine RMVR #916

PS.  While commuting the other day on I-70 (at 80+, normal speeds for
this stretch of the highway) I passed a Boxster with a small "thing"
sticking up in the back.  It was extended vertically across the back of the
rear trunk lid and looked like it had a strip of external bodywork on it.  It
was up about 2~3 inches.  Does anybody know what this is?  I've seen
nothing about a "spoiler" and other Boxsters I've passed (at 55) haven't
had this visible.
