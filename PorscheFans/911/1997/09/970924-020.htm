I appreciate your advice regarding the mounting of my sub strap, but
I do not appreciate the tone of your response.

Like I have previously mentioned, I am new to all of this and I am not
just learning about driving, but I am also learning about prepping my
car for time trials.  This is not the first time that I have made a
mistake with my installation, but this is the first time that I have
been called NUTS.

As far as my estate sueing you, don't worry.  I am very anti-lawsuits
and sports.  We all know the dangers.  I think that the Senna trial
is idiotic and the Mark Donohue's widow/Goodyear thing was the same.
Those associated with my estate know how I feel.  And hopefully, we
won't have to worry about that.

Dan Jones
