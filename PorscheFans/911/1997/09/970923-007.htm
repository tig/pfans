Paul:

Yeah, welded wheels are pretty popular among a certain segment of
the Porsche-owner population... I've seen them most often on early
911s that have been tarted up with aftermarket fiberglass
slantnose/turbo-look/targa-to-cabriolet kits.

If you really like the steamroller-tire look, they're the cheapest
way to go, but personally, I would never trust welded wheels on the
track.  Most of the reputable wheel companies (Robert Wood, Wheel
Enhancement, etc.) won't even touch them.

P.S.  I vaguely recall being told that the 5.5" wheels were the only 
      ones that were suitable for widening by welding... Don't know 
      why.
