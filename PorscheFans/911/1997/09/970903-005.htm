Last year, this very thing happened to a friend's non-P_car, which also had
K&N's.  He left the car out ovrnight during a major downpour, and in the
morning, it refused to start after cranking 1/2 revolution.  It locked up
tight as a drum.  Wisely, he refrained from trying to push start it.

Later that day, I was present when we pulled the pan: imagine the horror of
seeing 3 badly bent conecting rods!  We then pulled the plugs, and got
doused with a stream of water from each of the  plug holes.  There was no
doubt that the water came in through the K&Ns.
