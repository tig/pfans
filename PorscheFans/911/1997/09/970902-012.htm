    This could be a killer combo

    Imagine the result of using N2 in your tires instead of air and
mounting them on a Targa?   Everyone knows N2 is lighter than air. 
Modified laminar flow top and tires that lighten the car...  One would
have to double the size of the spoiler just to keep the car on the
ground.  Quite possibly this is where the statement 'that car really
flies" comes from.
    Just a thought.......
