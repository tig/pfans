I have a 79sc euro w/o AC  but with automatic heat control that has the 
interesting problem of not being able to produce heat. When i move the 
center dash controls for heat there is almost no discernable movement 
air from any of the vents, and it is definitly not warm. The fresh air 
works beautifully just like its supposed to. I do know for a fact that 
the blower in the engine compartment works, it goes without saying the 
relay works, and fuses are good. All of the duct-work seems to be 
intact in the engine area. Using the emergency heater lever does 
nothing. While the motor is running there is a LOT of hot air comming 
out from under the engine compartment (not the exhaust), it seems to 
come from somewhere around the block (it's not radient heat it is blown 
air from around the exchangers). I suspect either the control unit 
(light works but i can't notice that the dial does anything), something 
in the ductwork, or the interior temp sensor. First big question is how 
does the hot air travel from the heater blower in the engine 
compartment to the dash? (I have no idea where the duct work runs and 
where any gates might be) Where are the hot air dump gates on the heat 
exchangers? (Last time i had it in the shop the mech. said the gates 
had the springs disconnected and the gates were always closed, but it 
never got any hot air to the passenger compartment. The springs are 
hooked back up now) What operates them? Any suggestions will be greatly 
appreciated as this is my project for this weekend. also have a rear 
window defrost that doesn't heat up. (fueses & relay are good, wiring 
seems to be intact) what else is there?

TIA

cooling is no problem,
roll down the windows,
open the sun roof,
smile,
and floor it.   :  )
