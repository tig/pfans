     Thanks to all who responded with information on doing the 993 oil 
change. I did it last night in about three hours but expect that time to 
come down with experience. With what dealers are charging (I have heard $225 
to $300,Yikes!), I will continue doing it for the $75 it cost for Mobil 1 
from Pep Boys and filters from Motor Sports Road and Racing.

     For those who have struggled with the engine mounted oil filter (that 
would be everyone who did it the first time), this morning I got a cap-type 
filter wrench from my Porsche dealer for $7.80 that looks like it should 
greatly facilitate that part of the job.  I'll find out the next time.  It 
is aluminum and fits the oil filter snugly, unlike some of the stamped steel 
ones I have seen.  It has a Porsche label and has the part number 
000-721-920-40. I'm told it also works on Boxters.
