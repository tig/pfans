Don:

If you do this, make sure you use the CORRECT tape... All electrical
tape isn't the same.

The most commonly-available 3M tape is their "Scotch Super 33" brand;
it's thin, not too sticky, and I wouldn't trust it to stay on your
windshield through the winter.

A better choice is the "Scotch Super 88" brand, which is what I'd use
(mostly because I already have a couple of rolls of it).  The Super
88 tape is thick, sticky, and specifically designed to handle cold
weather.

They also make (but I've never used) a "Scotch Heavy Duty" tape
that's even thicker than Super 88 and which is supposed to have
better abrasion resistance.  Don't know about its
temperature-handling capabilities, though.

You can buy the Super 88 and Heavy Duty tape from, among other
places, Mouser Electronics (800 346-6873):

    Scotch Super 88:    Part number 517-88  $3.50 per 66-foot roll  
    Scotch Heavy Duty:  Part number 517-22  $7.38 per 108-foot roll 

Mouser has no minimum order amount and their shipping prices are 
reasonable.
