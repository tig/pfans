I recently drove a 1969 911 coupe with an 2.0L E-type engine.  Two questions
for the list.

1.  The machine has a five speed transmission.  When I first went through
the gears as I got underway, when going from third gear to fourth, the
transmission would slip into second rather than fourth.  I could come back
from second to neutral and then the transmission would shift to fouth as
normal.  This happen several times until I had traveled far enough to get
the engine up to normal operating temperature.  The next time it occurred
after reaching normal operating temperature, I could return to neutral but
the transmission would not shift to fourth nor fifth.  After arrivine home
in third gear, I cut the engine and had no problem shifting the transmission
into reverse or any of the five forward gears!!  ??What is most likely,
linkage problem, or something inside the transmission?  (I later drove the
car again and had no problem shifting up or down)

2.  On starting the engine cold, there is occassionally a large volume of
blue smoke briefly from the tailpipe.  It quickly clears to a small puffing
of mostly blackish-blue smoke that then clears as the engine warms up.
??Possible causes of this phenomenon?  Valve seals, rings??

Thanks in advance.
