I should have made it clear in my original post that I drive for at least 
20 minutes at highway speed, THEN idle for 20 sec before looking at the 
gauge.  The temp needle is in the middle 2/3 zone of the dial by this 
point.  So I think the oil is hot enough then.

My two related gripes are that the oil temp gauge has no numbers, just a 
few hash marks, so I never know when the oil hits the magic 180 degrees 
mentioned by Pfans.

The other gripe is (on the the 993 at least) the dipstick has to navigate 
this bend in the holding tube, to go from a horizontal tube at my end to I 
assume a vertical tube at the oil tank end. So it rubs against the tube and 
any oil clinging to the inside, smearing oil over most of the dipstick and 
making a true oil level reading pretty impossible.

The gauge should begin to read after the engine is out of the white zone at
the bottom of the oil temperature gauge. This defines "warmed up" for a
911. I might add that you should not let the engine exceed 4500 RPM before
this time as well. If you are not reading in the white on the level gauge
at the first (level ground) stop after warm-up then you definitely need
oil. I prefer the "three o'clock" level as a fill rule. I know this is
heresy, but you can bag the dipstick as long as the gauge is working.
