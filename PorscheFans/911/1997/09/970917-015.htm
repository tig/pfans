There is a quite clever little thing on the inside end of the pin that ho=
ld
it.
When You have one of them out, You understand what I mean. =

No locking device visible, nothing to remove, it is in the pin.

>    2.  How do I get the pins out so I can R&R the pads?

Just take a dia. 4mm pin, with this You can tap the pins out. There is a
small
holes on the outside of the caliper where pins end. If rusted in, perhaps=

some
WD-40 on inside and outside ends?

Check the correct angle of pistons & condition of rubber boots.
Kinda hard to tell it in writing, get at least the Hanes manual. it is
well explained there. =
