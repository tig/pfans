I put a new top on my 1983 911SC just about two years ago.  I can't say
who manufactured it, but I'm pretty certain it was a german import.  I have
a call in to the trim guy who did the work.  I'll let you know.

I know the liner is original German cloth, cut and installed by my trim guy
and I'm very pleased with it.  The top itself still looks brand new after
two years in Houston, and since it is fitted properly, I see very little 
wear from driving with it down.  The last top was not installed well at
all (it was also a replacement) and driving with the top down caused it
to wear holes in the top. :-(

I do garage the car, and have covered parking, so it doesn't sit in the sun
that much, but I drive it every day, rain or shine.
