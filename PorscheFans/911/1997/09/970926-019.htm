Hi Walt,
  I'm the guy with the distributor question and I would like to:
>vacuum retard if you don't want retard when you don't
>have much vacuum (WOT), and do want retard when you do have high
>vacuum (as when butterflies are closed).
You also described:
>to insert two restrictors of 0.040 inches about 3" apart in
>the vacuum line to smooth out the pulsations.

  I would like to try your suggestion, as it is alot easier than drilling
the intake manifolds to obtain other cylinder's vacuum.  I've looked at the
intake timing diagrams in last months Pano, and it appears that I would have
to drill all of the cylinders to obtain a consistent vacuum signal.

  My question is what size vacuum line(I.D.) are you using and what is it
connected to?  If it is the intake manifold what exactly do these 0.040"
(Dia?) restrictions look like?  Are they just solid rods with holes in them
or are they thin discs, etc.?

Thanks,
Mark
