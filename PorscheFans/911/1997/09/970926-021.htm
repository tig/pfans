Was: Chain Tensioners- Tom Sandvik <sandvik@mail.gte.net>

Thanks to Tom Sandvik for all the information about his good experiences
with German Motors in Safety Harbor, FL. I noticed that Tom was in a
neighboring town to mine and sent him a personal email requesting his
recommendation for a quality Porsche garage. In my signature, I
mentioned that my 911 was patiently awaiting resuscitation in my garage.
He inquired, and here's the long tale.

The problem with my car started at least a year ago with a collision
with a 2x4 laying flat on I275. My wife limped home with a minor
leak (scary!) in the gas tank. After the tank was drained, inspected,
removed, filled with water, welded, drained and reinstalled, we
expected everything to be as it was just before the mishap.

The car seemed fine for a few days, however, on one errand the
car sent out a cry for help about 10 miles into the drive. Traveling
along at around 50 mph, the engine started to loose power, back-fire,
surge, cause the car to buck, and soon stall. Coasting to a safe spot
to stop, my wife and looked ahead in silence; envisioning dollars
blowing away in the wind. We let the car sit for a minute, hoping
that somehow just sitting still might miraculously fix whatever was
ill deep inside the engine compartment.

It started perfectly, and idled as well as it ever has- so we got back
on our way. Once again, everything was fine, until about 5 miles into
our restart. The same thing- stalled again. We waited a minute,
and the car started right away. We were off again.

The cycle kept repeating itself, with the duration of mean time
between failures getting shorter and shorter. Each time the car
sparked right back after a few minutes of rest. The engine did
not seem to receive any undue stress during this unusual trip
home. Temperature stayed fine, oil pressure looked good- of course
the starter and the battery couldn't have been too happy.

For hours we hypothesized about the possible causes. Thinking that
the gas tank incident coincided with the start of the problem, that's
where we focused our attention. Hmmm... Could there be some
residual water left in the tank? Could our inspection have missed
something that was jarred loose and is now clogging the fuel system
somewhere? Like a rusted metal fleck being sucked against the
tank outlet, only to be released as the vacuum is removed. How
about a severely clogged fuel filter? Bad fuel lines, or a bad fuel
pump?

Everything has checked out just fine. My focus will next be on things
like a problem in the MFI pump (I need a good manual), or clogged
injectors. Based on some helpful hints shared on PorscheFans,
these areas are the next most logical. However, removing and
cleaning the injectors is easy; rebuilding the MFI pump is either
difficult or not recommended (I just have to locate a good book on
this).

It's a real head scratcher- What would cause the engine to loose
power upon reaching its operating temperature, yet restart immediately
and soon kill itself in a continually decreasing time cycle?

I initially thought that the cold-rich mixture was stuck "on" and
flooding
the engine at temperature, however, I'm pretty certain that the engine
died
for being starved for fuel rather than flooded. A few gunked up
injectors
running at rich should sustain the engine at some minimal level of
operation, but at temperature, with things leaned out, the engine would
likely starve. In this scenario, the engine would probably start back
up but repeat the die out cycle quicker and quicker as the engine gets
hotter and hotter.

Any thoughts from the list on this matter would be greatly appreciated.
As many who subscribe believe, I would much rather toil and learn
the intricacies of my engine myself, than to have someone else do
it for me and have all the fun. Now I just need to find the time to dig
into
the problem; a year has been too long.

Thank you in advance.
