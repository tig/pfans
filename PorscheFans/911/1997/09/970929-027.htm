I concur with most of Bill's response.  I use a '69T coupe as a daily driver
(about 35 mi per day).  The ventilation system is quite primative in the wet
and should be checked thoroughly before purchasing the car.  I also agree
that early 911s can be less than a joy in stop and go traffic.  However, in
my experience much of this unpleasantness is due to a combination of stiff
clutch and odd 1st to 2d gear change on the old 901 transmissions.  This
wouldn't seem to be a problem with an automatic equipped car.  Additionally,
a 911S is an even worse car in stop and go traffic than a T or E because of
the S's state of engine tune.  You should also be aware of the difference
between a car with carburetors versus one with mechanical fuel injection.

Otherwise my car holds up well as a daily driver; I have no desire to use
anything else.  Having a good mechanic who is knowlegable about early 911's
is a must if you plan on using the car daily, even if you intend on doing
most of the work yourself.  I take mine in to my mechanic about four times a
year just to have him spend an hour going over it to see if anything needs
fixing/replacing.  These are 25 year old cars.  Even the most well kept old
911 can develop a problem because some original part decided to suddenly fail
after 25 years.  However, having said that, the only time I've been let down
by my 911 was on a 105 degree day in the Mojave desert when a hot start
problem developed at a rest stop.  However, this problem was easily fixed.

Problem areas?  Check the electrics -- especially if aftermarket accessories
such as a stereo or alarm have been added.  I've also found that many early
911s have had their suspensions lowered in the past.  This may be fine in a
canyon or on the open road but can be a pain in the city when going over
speed bumps, manhole covers, etc...  As far as cost of parts and availability
is concerned, I recommend getting catalogs from some of the major suppliers
in order to see what's out there and at what price.  Used early 911 parts are
also plentiful.  There's also a good book available on buying used 911s ("The
Used 911 Story").  Good luck!
