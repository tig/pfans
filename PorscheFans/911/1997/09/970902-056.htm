Hi Folks,

can anyone of you technical guys can help me on a problem?

I have a 1980 911SC that doesn't fire up when hot. There is no simtoms of
problems when cold.

Though I have checked that there are sparks at the plugs and there is fuel
pumping through the filter when this problem occurs.

Since this I have replaced 'warm up regulator' and 'auxilary air valve'.

I have eliminate the possibility of the 'ignition module' since there are
sparks; and I have also tested with another coil.

What else could I diagnois and can go wrong when it gets hot.

One more note:
I could get it fire up immediately after running; but only if it set for 5+
minutes. And also it runs fine as long as I don't shut it off.

Help!!!!!
