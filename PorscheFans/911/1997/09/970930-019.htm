Recently I posted a question about upgrading my '87 brakes to 968 or 'big
reds'. I've been asking around at some shops also and I think it's just a
bit over the hill on the expense side 8^( and I got the impression not to
expect to much extra brake performance with these brakes on the street.
But I still have to get new rotors & pads, so I'm thinking of drilled (and
or slotted) rotors and some type of carbon pads (Cool Carbon, Pagid, etc…).
First of all I would like some advice on which pads to get. I know it has
been a thread for at least a thousand times, but the files are a b…. to
search. How about padlife, dust and rotor wear (not too much concerned
about the squeaks). I'm a pretty spirited driver, but there's not much
track action here in the Netherlands so it's mainly street/road use. Any
advise on the rotors is welcome also.
Second where can I order these parts best (preferably on the Net) and what
are reasonable prices?
I'm also thinking about installing brake ducts. If so, do I have to remove
the foglights to make place for the inlets (this is certainly not
preferred)?
Well, that's about all for now. All comments are welcome.

TIA
