Standard offset 7" wheels work also.  I ran 7x15 Cookie Cutters with
225/50-15s at each corner without any problems.  The only caveat is
that each car is different and what fits some cars won't fit others.  My
application was a '76, but I don't think there are drastic differences
between the '74-'77 cars and the '69-'73 cars...

In fact, I've got the Cookies/tires for sale if anyone wants them...
