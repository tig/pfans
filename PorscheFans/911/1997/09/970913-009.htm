Fans,

I've had the Platinum Bosch Plugs in my 87 coupe for about 28k kms.  I've
read that plugs should be changed at least every two years (their service
manual).  The car starts w/o any hesitation and there isn't any difference
in performance since the day they were installed.

Should I be changing them now? and is it necessary at this point?  The
plugs are supposed to be self-cleaning and able to run problem free for up
to double that mileage or more.

Also, the rotor and cap haven't been changed in the same interval.  Should
this be a consideration to?  I've seen allot of threads about the 02
sensor.  I have about 113k kms on the car (over 60k miles I think).  Should
the 02 sensor be replaced now or should I wait for symptoms to occur?  This
item wouldn't cause me to be stranded road side would it?

Joe


Electronic ignition systems generate tremendous voltages, on the order of
100,000 volts open-circuit.  Worn plugs will fire in oil at that voltage. 
However, a clean and properly gapped plug will spark-over at only 2000
volts or less.  The advantage of electronic ignition systems is that they
deliver more power - a hotter spark.  As the plugs wear and accumulate
contamination, they start sparking over at progressively higher voltages. 
The car may still run great, but the ignition coil, your high-voltage
insulation, and the electronics all experience higher voltage stress.  This
is a real problem, and the parts will fail prematurely and sometimes
catastrophically.  You will be left dead on the road if the electronic
ignition module fails, the rotor explodes, or the distributor cap cracks or
starts tracking.  It is cheaper in the long run to do the normal
maintenance.  Replace the plugs at the recommended interval - they are much
cheaper than tow jobs and ignition modules.

The car will run fine with a bad O2 sensor.  Your fuel economy will likely
suffer, and your emissions will be too high.  You might foul the plugs due
to over-rich mixture.  Do all of us air breathers a favor, and replace the
thing at the recommended interval.

I tried Bosch Platinums in my 1970 911T.  The car ran poorly until I
changed them.  I have the best luck with NGK BP7ES plugs, which are less
expensive and seem to give better service on my carburated engine.  I would
ignore Bosch's marketing hype about "self-cleaning".  I doubt if their
engineers do not believe it.  I certainly do not, and have seen deposits on
their plugs.
