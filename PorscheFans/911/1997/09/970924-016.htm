I bet this subject has been beaten to death but without a searchable
archive, 
I'm lost to find the answers  (hint, hint).  

I'd appreciate hearing from others regarding problems with the a/c on
their
911s.  I've had an '86 coupe since new and here's a summary of my
a/c repairs:
-- Compressor replaced twice and it's still leaking oil
-- System will *not* hold a charge; recharge interval is about 4 mos
max.
-- System changed to R134a last year.  Works fine when it's freshly
   charged and costs less to recharge.

The a/c system has been the single highest maintenance item on the car.

Does every 911 have a/c problems?
Are there any fixes??  Different compressor?  Tricks?

It's headed back to the Porsche dealer this week for a second recharge
of the season.  Sure would like to fix this problem once and for all!!

Thanks much,
           Alan Olson

Alan, I'm not close enough to your car to give you anything more than a
guess as to what your complete problem is, but if you changed to 134a
and did not change to barrier hose then the most likely source of leak
is the hose. You see 134a is made up of a very very much smaller
molecule and therefore can pass through the older freon hose like it was
made of cheesecloth. And since Porsches have ten times as much freon
hose as a 'real' car, the lose will be felt much sooner. For example
most G.M. cars hold 4 # of refrigerant and have about 6 ft. of hose,
whereas your 911 holds 3 # of refrigerant and has about 30 ft. of hose.
You might also have a leak at the seal of the comp. if this comp. is not
designed to handle 134a, because the rubber that was used to retain R12
will not seal 134a. Ask your a/c tech to check these things even if you
have to take the car somewhere other than a dealer.
