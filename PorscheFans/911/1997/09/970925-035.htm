Someone asked about getting a suitable vacuum for a carb conversion.  I
looked through my manuals to see if I could tell how the factory did this,
but to no avail.  I think the early cars may have had all centrifugal
distributors, in which case no need.  However, manifold vacuum should
be just fine for vacuum retard if you don't want retard when you don't
have much vacuum (WOT), and do want retard when you do have high
vacuum (as when butterflies are closed).  And, to the other post on this
subject, Weber carbs of the sort we use on 911s don't have any sort of
vacuum port built in.  At least the 40s and 46s one sees and I have don't.

Pulsing vacuum is another story.  I think this is dealt with by having at
least two vacuum ports, say on cylinders which fire 360 degrees from
eachother (1 and 3, for instance - use the firing order to figure out the 
combinations), or maybe more.  If factory took vacuum from carbs,
perhaps someone on the list who actually has one of these might
enlighten us inveterate speculators.

I use a Cagle vacuum adjustable fuel pressure regulator on my race
engines (more pressure at lower vacuum), and their instructions, which I
followed, said to insert two restrictors of 0.040 inches about 3" apart in
the vacuum line to smooth out the pulsations.  This might work for a
distributor also.  Disclaimer:  I just followed directions, and did not do
before and after testing, nor did I instrument anything to see what its
effect was, etc.  Nor have I tried it on a distributor.
