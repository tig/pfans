James -

There is a rattle noise that is characteristic of tired clutches in G50 trans.
My '87 has it.  It only happens when I release the clutch in 1st and the
RPMs dip below 1000.  Then it is rather obvious.  A fellow fan replaced his
clutch (with the same type) and the problem was solved.  He said that by
examining the old clutch mechanism it was clear which part was causing the
rattle.

Also take note that there is a factory bulletin on the clutch pivot shaft in
these transmissions.  The bearings and fork are replaced to eliminate a sticky
pedal feel (I'm also a victim of this one.)  You might want to make this
upgrade
when you do the clutch work.  Its only about $150 for the FACTORY parts.

Hope this helps,

- Brad
