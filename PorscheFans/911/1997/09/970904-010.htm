Ken,

The electrical interface to the DME is probably the easy part.  If Porsche
followed the European standard, it is called ISO9141.  You can buy
relatively inexpensive hardware that interfaces to a PC and in turn to the
ISO99141 serial bus.  These have simple DOS or Windows interfaces tat
let you download and upload packets to the bus.

The problem is that there are no standards on the data itself.  I.e. the
code for RPM is different with Audi vs. BMW vs. Porsche.  The European
auto manufacturers are aware of the problems this creates and are
working on standardizing.  I believe that they hoped to do this by the year
2000.  

This does you no good at all unless you buy a new car.  And leaves you
with the job of finding out the codes if you want to create your own tool
to access your DME.  Normally, the manufacturers will share this
information with companies interested in building test gear.  If they'll
share with an individual is another matter.

Your e-mail address is HP and I know HP is doing things along this line in
Loveland or Ft Collins, so you may be able to find someone who is more
knowledgable inside HP.

Good luck if you pursue this,
