I read pretty unusual considerations about titanium here in the list! What
is a generic "cycle"? Stress cycle? Rotation cycle? And what about a
"finite life of much less than aluminum (about a million Cycles)"?
Titanium (titanium alloy, for the sake of precision) is a incredible
material with outstanding performances, with 1600 C melting point, 4.5
kg/dmc specific mass, 100-140 kg/smm traction resistance (sorry for the
awful italian/english translation of the technical terms...).
Titanium is also almost corrosion-free, has a very low thermal dilatation
and a very low coefficient of elasticity.
Titanium has two major defects: cost and low friction resistance.
The first one doesn't depend on the raw cost of the material (titanium is
the fourth available metal on the Earth) but on the difficult machining and
welding. The traditional, outstanding and expensive Ti 6Al 4V  alloy has,
now, good and cheaper alternatives in Ti 6Al 1.7Fe 0.1Si and Ti 5.8Al 1.8Fe
Cr Si and more.
The second problem is now worked out applying metallic or nonmetallic
surface treatments to the moving parts (valves, con rods etc.).
You can produce springs, valves, rods, frame components, exhaust systems
very very light and, for that reason, less subject to stress and
vibrations. Ferrari F355 (a special but  very reliable production car) , is
equipped with titanium con rods. The major car makers are very close to
introduce (cheaper) titanium alloy components in regular production cars.
Yes, I'd like having titanium rods, valves, springs and exhaust in my 964
turbo!
