I just purchased a 1973 911 Targa VIN# 9113111437.  for $10,000.00
Canadian ($6500.00 U.S.)   It has an after market turbo wide body
conversion.  The car looks great but has a bad oil leak or should I say
leaks.  The car has a 2.7 litre engine.  I've been told that it was made
with a magnesium case and has a tendency to warp.  There are leaks from
the cylinder tubes and the valve cover gaskets.  At high rpm the oil
leak gets worse and smoke comes out through the heater vents, due to the
oil dripping onto the exhaust tubes.  there is also oil residue coming
through from behind the alternator fan.  The oil tank also has a bad
leak. Every time I come to a stop at an intersection smoke billows from
the car ands just ruins the whole look of the car.  I am putting in
about 4 quarts a week.  I have decided on puttiing the car away until I
can get this problem sorted out.  Does anyone have any advise as to what
the problem areas might be or any recommendation?
I am also interested in putting a 3 litre in as a replacement.

I am also looking for these parts for the above car and any direction
would be greatly appreciated

Steering/ignition lock assembly with key
Oil tank
Dash board replacement
Targa top seals
windsheild

please let me know price and location via e-mail at the below address

I am also interested in replacing my front fenders with later model
fenders with an '86 front nose.  I need to if it is as simple as taking
off the 73 fenders and putting on the 86 ones or do ant modifications
have to be made.  I suspect I will have to change the front bumper cover
and hood.  The 73 fenders have the light assembly built into them where
the later model has them in the bumper.  I bought the car with an
aftermarket body kit already installed;.  the lights in the front
fenders have been removed and the bumpercover has the signals built in.
So it looks close to a later model but not quite.
if anyone is familiar with this type of conversion please advise me.

I also have had to replace the rear passenger side wheel bearing twice.
I am told I am going through them due to the 2" gemballa wheel spacers I
have on the back.  But if that was the case then the left side would
also be damaged.  I went through one in 1 week.  When it was removed it
came out in pieces.  I didnt race the car on a track or go off roading.
Just a long distance drive and some older streets.  This seems very
abnormal to me.  Coould it be the installation?   Does anyone have any
suggestions regarding this problem?


I also need a good recommendation for a mechanic in the Toronto area.
To bring my car.  Any suggestions.

I sure that is enough questions for now.

Thank You
