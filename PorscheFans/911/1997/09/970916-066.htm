Gene, have done the oil change a few times on my 993.   Yes, they're
different;
give yourself a good day to do it the first time.

The following is an article I wrote for our Porsche Club region newsletter,
the 
Allegheny Region "Rundschau"

Ray Calvo  (porsray@aol.com)
1995 993

(PS - if you think this is different from your old 911, check the tool bag.
I'm still looking for the tools used to change the fan belt, plus the spare
belt(s).
Porsche dropped this on the new cars, too!)

ZEN AND THE ART OF 993 OIL CHANGES

by Ray Calvo (with apologies to the author of the famous book with "Zen" in
the title)

As you might have gathered from past articles, I tend to be somewhat of a
"wrench twirler", being willing to do work on my cars (even sometimes to
their detriment).  Reasons for this are somewhat financial (I don't charge
myself labor), somewhat timing (trying to get time to drop the car off &
arrange to pick it up is a major nuisance, especially in these days of
possibly being canned due to "downsizing"), but mostly - I enjoy doing it!
 So, when someone told me that changing oil and filters on a 993 was a major
job, I just figured maybe taking 1 hour rather than 1/2 hour like on my old
Carrera.  Well, I have since found out that this job can consume the better
part of a Saturday.  Worse, unless you're careful, you can also "paint" your
garage floor with about 9 quarts of old, dirty oil!.

For those of you who intend to tackle this job yourself, value from my
experience.  For those of you who are sane and leave Porsche maintenance to
the pros, hope you can get a good laugh from all of this.

Items needed:
  900 123 118 30     Seal washer for oil tank drain plug, 22x27mm
  900 123 118 30     Seal washer for engine drain plug, 22x27mm (thru '95)
  900 123 095 30     Seal washer for engine drain plug, 21x26mm ('96 on)
  999 701 269 40     O'ring for oil tank drain plug, 11X2.5 mm
  993 107 203 02     Engine oil filter
  993 207 201 01     Oil tank oil filter

Tools:
   15mm 6-point socket (can damage drain plugs with 12-point)
   15 mm box end wrench (6-point preferable, if you can find one)
   Large flat-head screwdriver
   Medium Phillips screwdriver
   Oil filter wrench (type that clamps on end of filter -bring new filter to
store & match)
   Hydraulic jack
   Jack stand
   Torque wrench

OK, let's get started!

1)  Jack up right rear of car, remove wheel. Put jack stand under car to hold
weight,
remove jack (blocks oil tank drain)
2)  Unscrew screws holding rear fender liners in place, remove liners.
3)  Unscrew screws holding entire rocker panel cover in place up to front
fender, swing cover down out of way (will have to undo the screws at bottom
rear of 
front fender liner).
4)  Unscrew engine cover (5 screws) and transmission cover (6 screws, as I
remember) and remove.  These are held in place with Dzus style fasteners; 1/4
turn unlocks and releases the screws.
5)  Loosen slightly the oil tank drain plug (WARNING! IT IS ALUMINUM, AND
APPEARS VERY EASY TO STRIP THE HEX HEAD!)
6)  Put wheel back on, lower car
7)  Remove oil tank drain plug, drain oil.  Renew O'ring on drain plug, put
new sealing washer on plug,tighten to 40 ft-lbs. For info, had to drop car at
this point because the oil tank drain is right over the jack location.
8)  Jack up car, remove wheel.  Renew oil tank oil filter.
9)  Remove the right-side heater flapper valve (bottom of engine).  Remove
rubber heater duct from flapper valve to heater valve (above and in front of
axle).
10) Unscrew the engine drain plug (left side of engine half, by left heater
flapper valve).  This will apparently only take a box-end wrench; there is
insufficient room for a socket.  If the plug won't move, try rapping the
wrench with a hammer.
11) Place new seal washer on drain plug, tighten to 40 ft-lbs.
12) Use filter wrench and long extension to unscrew the engine filter. This
is in a very tight area; might have to unbolt a drain tube adjacent to the
filter (I haven't).  Replace filter.
13) Reinstall the rocker panel cover, wheelwell liner, and transmission
cover.
14) Add six quarts of oil.
15) Start engine, let idle, and slowly add last 3 quarts.  Go for a drive to
warm up engine, then top-up as necessary.

A few last items:
a) When replacing the drain plugs, Porsche makes no mention of using a
anti-seize compound.  I use one out of habit.
b) When replacing filters, make sure to lube the rubber oil seal with engine
oil, then screw on firmly HAND TIGHT ONLY.  I've got a good horror story of
trying to remove a filter tightened in place with a wrench.  This hand-tight
installation might be hard to do on the engine filter; recommend using filter
wrench with extension, hold HEAD of ratchet on extension end and tighten
moderately.  Hopefully, you can remove the filter wrench later.
c) Notice I didn't reinstall the engine panel.  Bruce Anderson has made the
recommendation to leave this panel off the 993 and 964 C2/C4; this panel
causes excessive heat retention and premature valve guide wear.

Fun, wasn't it?  And all it took was 4 hours.

     OK, who has changed the oil on a 993? I was going to change mine for
the first time on Saturday. After removing the underside panels, I found
that nothing was where I expected it to be from previous 911's.

     Someone clue me in so I can stop feeling like a complete moron.
