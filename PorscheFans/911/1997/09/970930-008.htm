Unless you've played the Porsche Edition of Trivial pursuit you might
not know this but starting in 1985 the stub axle was "friction welded" 
to the outer CV joint so you can't just unbolt the CV from the stub axle. 
(I think Steve said he had an '87.) The huge (32mm) impact socket you 
need is available from "normal" autoparts stores like Pep Boys. This is 
just the excuse you need to get that air compressor and impact wrench 
(get the 600ftlb Ingersol-Rand one).

If you can't get the inner joint off the axle, bring it to a garage and
have them press it off. Just make sure that they don't press off the
outer one too. If they _do_, email me for the "solution". Trust me,
you don't want _that_ much fun.

 Chris
