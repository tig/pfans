First, I'll disavow "expert" status, but I've seen a HUGE difference
in on-track temps by getting more air to the cooler.  I have an
'84 Carrera (so it has more cooler to begin with), and my wife
and I both drive.  Even with the Carrera cooler, we were seeing temps
in the 240-260 degree range.  I've simply done the "cut holes in 
the headlight basket" proceedure.  It's dropped the max temp to 
the 210 - 215 degree range. Several others with SC loop coolers 
have done the same with excellent results (and it's a lot cheaper 
than a new cooler).

I just drilled 5-6, 1 1/2" diamater holes in the sheet metal behind 
the headlight, removed the headlight, and added wire mesh to keep 
stones (& other stuff!) out of my cooler.

Might be worth trying for the track (but, obviously this won't help
much on the street....).
