Hello Porsche Folk-

I am having a problem with my 1983 SC, and I hope that somebody out there
can help me out. First a little background.

Some time ago I noticed that the oil temp was consistantly running warmer
than it had last summer. Last year I drove the car on several longish
trips, on very hot days, and NEVER had a problem with the oil temp. Then
this summer I noticed that the oil temp was running hotter than it ever had
before. Upon inspection of the oil lines I noticed that I had at some point
managed to crush a section of the line that feeds the oil cooler loop at
the front of the car. I assumed that there was just no oil getting to the
oil cooler loop, as when the oil temp got quite warm, the cooler loop was
stone cold.

This past weekend I FINALLY replaced the section of line that had the crimp
in it. I cut out the bad section, and replaced it with a section of 3,500
PSI hydrolic line with heavy duty ferrule fittings on each end, and
expected that all my worries would be over....Of course I was WRONG!

Now here is what we have going on;

All four oil lines at the Thermastat are very hot, (as one would expect I
guess due to thermal transfer down the line). The oil line that leaves the
'stat and heads to the front of the car to feed the cooler loop is hot, BUT
gets progressively cooler as it goes forward to the point that the cooler
loop is stone cold. The return line is also stone cold, until you get to
the 'stat, at which point it is hot again. Both of the lines that run to
the 'stat from the motor are hot along their entire length. There are no
other kinks or crimps in any of the lines, so I do not believe the oil is
being impeeded by the lines themselves in any way, (although I supose it IS
possible that there is something INSIDE the line, but I am at a loss to
explain HOW it would have gotten in there to beghine with, so I am
discounting this theory).

It is my beliefe that there IS oil flow through the cooler, BUT it is a
very small amount, I believe this for the following reasons;

My oil level gauge will show no reading, (that is it will not move off its
low point) UNTIL the oil temp reaches the first hash mark, at which point
the gauge starts to show a reading. This would indicate that the oil has
started to move through the loop, and is now returning to the oil tank.
(This is how my car had ALWAYS acted, UNTIL I crushed the oil line, and
then the gauge would NEVER show a reading, due to the fact that oil was
never filling the tank from the cooler loop). This combined with the fact
that the oil cooler feed line IS warm would mean to me SOMETHING is moving
through there, (I guess?).

SO, I think that I may have a problem with the thermastat itself. Do folks
out there concur? Is it possible that the 'stat is working partially? As I
understand it, the thermastat CAN be serviced on the car. Does anybody have
a schematic? Anybody have any specific experince similar to this?

In the interest of giving as much possible info as I can, I will ad that my
oil pressure SEEMS good, (5 bar cold, but no more than about 3.5 to 4 at
redline when the oil gets REAL hot, I THINK this is normal?)

ANY and ALL help is appreciated, I would REALLY like to get this fixed SOON!! 

PLEASE HELP!
