Having built a POC class champion Carrera I'll throw my $.02 in the ring...

First I am curious to why you picked the setup you did....? 23mm F and 29mm R
will balance your bias to understeer which will hurt your autocross
potential.  I would recommend gundrilled torsion bars with 30 to 31mm R to
mate with the 23mm F - then with the front sway bar set on full hard use the
rear to tune for the course (e.g. full soft rear on tracks with fast high
speed corners and a little less soft for the tighter twisty stuff). Of course
this all depends on what style of driver you are but lets face it - the
faster drivers in the world (i.e. Schumacher, Senna, Lauda, etc..) are/were
characterized as being able to handle a "twitchy" / oversteer biased car. Of
course the stiffer the springs the less sway bar you need to control roll
stiffness - but with torsion bars only you don't have enough spring rate to
go with anything smaller than the largest sway bars available. Charlie Bars
probably are the best sway bars you can buy and my preference is a 1"#5 F and
1"#4 R although a #5R will work but you will usually have on full soft and
the #4 gives you a bit more range.

I personally don't like Konis and found the Bilsteins are the very best
technology available with infinite valve settings available through the
Racing Division here in SoCal. 
But you are evidently seeking a compromise with a streetable car and while
the torsion bars will certainly stiffen your ride it is the shocks that
can/will make the little bumps and cracks in the road unbareable - so then
perhaps adjustable Konis will make your street life easier.  The bushings
will also make street life horrible - I chose not to use them and frankly the
handling of my car is still fantastic. If you do use plastic bushings be sure
to add grease fittings for periodic lubrication to prevent their inherent
brain scrambling noises.

One last thing your tub will flex more as your suspension stiffens so invest
in the best roll bar or better yet complete cage you can afford to make the
suspension work and not the tub. 


Have fun,
Ross

<< I have a 1985 Carrera and am in the process of upgrading the suspension
for some serious autocross and time trial participation. For the front I've
decided on Koni adjustable sport shocks, new ball joints and turbo tie rods,
hard compound bushings, and 23mm torsion bars.  For the rear, hard compound
spring plate bushings, 29mm torsion bars, and the Konis. The tires and wheels
are stock 16" Fuchs with R1's.  
My questions for those of you who have done this...will adding larger
diameter
sway bars give me any more bang for the buck...and is this combination of
torsion bars (23/29) going to give me much grief on the street?

Thanks,

Martin James
