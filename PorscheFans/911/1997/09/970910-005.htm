Well, the wrench is wright, the job is a bitch. Nevertheless, if you
possess a very large amount of patience you can probably do it yourself.
The reason this is not written up anywhere is because doesn't happen enough
to warrant a repair procedure. Basically, it involves carefully removing
the broken cable, which is, of course, threaded through the nightmare of
cables, wires, tubes and vents under and behind the dash. You might try
pulling the broken cable wire through from both ends and threading a new
wire in. You might get away with just pulling the control panel in the
dash, because I believe the fresh air control cable is directly accessible
from the front compartment (under the carpet).
