    Oh, thank God... For a second there, I thought I was going to
    have to post the instructions AGAIN.

    The bezels are sorta crimped down over the edges... To open the
    gauges, you need to SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY pry the lip up, all the
    way around the gauge.

    I guess it depends on your own ability.  Every time I send a
    gauge to North Hollywood Speedometer and they open it, it comes
    back looking like new... But every time I open one myself, I
    screw up the bezel no matter HOW careful I am.

    The damage I've done is just cosmetic (and is completely hidden
    when the gauges are in the dash), but if you want your gauges to
    look perfect, send them out to someone who's already opened a
    couple thousand of them.
