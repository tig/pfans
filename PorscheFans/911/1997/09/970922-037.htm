<<The car is in phenomenal shape and I'd like to keep it that way.  (yeh, I
know, if the above is true I should just kick the daily drivers out of the
garage).>>

I would say kick the car you drive daily out of the garage.  A 91 C2 Turbo is
way too nice of a car to let it sit outside (any Porsche is), and no matter
how nice of a car cover you buy it is still like a bra/bug guard - moisture
will get under it and cloud up your paint if you don't remove it regularly.
 Plus the fact that the cover will actually freeze onto your paint.  I had it
happen on one of my cars (not a Porsche) when I was in college.  I had the
most expensive outdoor cover that Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories had and
water still seeped through it and froze the cover to my car's paint.  Please
do not leave such a beautiful car outside in the winter.  If worse comes to
worse rent a storage building or bring it over to my house for the winter.
 Anything but leaving it out!  Would you leave $90K in cash outside with
nothing covering it but a flimsy car cover?  Enough said.
