Hi,


I remember hearing about that case in Germany several years ago.
Apparently, the bumper of a '90s 911 caught fire which lead to an engine
fire. Porsche investigated the accident and noticed that the driver had
been rear ended at one point which pushed the bumber back 1/2 inch or
so. The change wasn't noticeable to owner, but obviously enough to put
the bumper in contact with the exhaust system which lead to the fire. It
seems like a ridiculous law suit to me, but with the money class actions
lawyers make today it is not surprising. The lawyers are going to sue
and make millions and the Porsche owners who join the lawsuit will get
some meaningless settlement of $500 towards their next Porsche.
