I have tried 3 in my "S" cam'd, Weberized, 10:1 Piston'd 1980 3.0L motor:

1. Stock - Boo. Can't cut the mustard. See #2 and #3
2. Permatune CD box with the Blue Bosch coil - MUCH better. The
   car idles better and runs strong. I gap the plugs to .040" and
   it is very happy. This is what is currently in the car.
3. Crane HI-6 System with their PS91 coil - HOT. This is a multispark
   system (it sparks up to 7 times at idle) and the cars runs smoothest
   on this system. I don't notice any difference in power over the
   permatune system. This is NOT a direct plug-in like the permatune;
   you have to do a little wiring. Too, this system fries the little resistor
   in the rotor. It literally blew one up on me once! You need to find
   a low resistance rotor if you want to use this coil.

I am running the permatune now and like it. The Crane system is more
sophisticated and cheaper, but not a super easy drop in. The Crane
system also requires a little attention be paid to things like the rotor
and the wires. The difference in the way MY engine runs on these
hot systems vs. the stock system is dramatic. I do not suppose that
this will be the case with everyone. I would also assume that a well
tuned injected car would show less of a difference than I see.
