Porschefans-

Well I sit here with two sorely brused ribs, but I also now have a car that
actually uses the oil cooler up front!!

So I just wanted to update the list on the outcome of a question I had
posted about a week ago. I have a 1983 911sc that was running to warm. I
recieved several responses from the list, all of which assured me that I
had a bad thermastat. Several folks even went so far as to quote the exact
part number I needed. So placing my trust in the list I called the local
Porsche shop and ordered that part, sight unseen, certain it was what I
needed, and indeed it was! So here is how the process played out.

Yesterday I spent two very frustraiting hours fighting with a VERY stubborn
thermastst threaded cap that had absolutely NO intention of comming loose
from its' housing. I started with a massive pair of channel locks, but it
was immediately apparent that I was not going to get enough purchase on the
cap to ever turn it, so using a sugestion from a very wise friend, (Thanks
Barry) I went to a pipe wrench. Once again I was met with an immovable
object, and BELIEVE me when I tell you I put enough force on it that I was
certain SOMETHING was going to snap any second. So, certain that this thing
was not going to be undone that day I doused it with liquid wrench or some
such penetraiting oil in the hopes that it would help.

So this afternoon, I went back at it, and met with the same frustation, and
in fact even managed a decent injury as the wrench slipped of at the point
when I was pulling with more fource than I had used all weekend, and
managed to slam the wrench into my rib cage with a solid thud that nearly
knocked the wind out of me. Well, that was IT I was going to the heat, yup
pulled out the tourch and let her have it. I was a bit apprehensive as I
had Never even used one before so I had no idea how long to heat the
housing. Well after what fealt like "long enough" I went at it again with
the pipe wrench. Once again pulling down with all my might, (I was laying
under the car, with my foot wedged up in the foot well, I am sure would
have made one heck of a picture! :-) I thought the wrenched had slipped off
again, but as I was moving from my second to the third swear-word I noticed
that the cap had actually MOVED!!! YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH It WORKED!!!!!!! Oh
man I was so happy I could not believe I had actaully managed to win the
battle, I WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, to make a long story a little shorted, I replaced the old thermastat
with the new one, and I can't believe it, but I actually have a car that
now cools its' oil!!! I can actually go on a road trip now!!! YES! :-))))

Thank you very much to all the list memebers that helped me out, your
advice was very mich appreciated!!!
