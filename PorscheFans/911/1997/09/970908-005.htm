Frank,

I have an 87 coupe and experienced the wiper relay problems some what
similar to yours.  My wipers didn't park in the correct place (only where
you turned them off) and the intermittent button would turn the wipers on,
but there was no intermittent setting.

In my situation it was the intermittent wiper relay.  Located in the front
boot.  The fresh air blower had to be removed (looks intimidating, but it's
not that bad) and just removed it from the fire wall where it was bolted
down.  I opened up the unit and cleaned the contacts with some contact
cleaner and a very fine emery board.  Out it all together and never had a
problem since.  The relay here in Canada was $149, and all I had to do was
clean mine.

I'd investigate this issue further, you might have a 'burned out'
electronic component in the relay unit (perhaps why the knob doesn't turn
the unit on?).

Joe
