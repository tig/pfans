Pfans,

This thread has been thrashed pretty well.  Personally I wave
at older 911's and more than half wave back.  When passing
a 356 on the freeway I always get the driver's attention and
give a thumbs up, with usually good results.  I don't bother
with most 964 or 993 since I usually get ignored.

I've always thought it was a "life in the foodchain" issue and
recently read an article on the 71S written in 71 by Bob
Kovacik in "Sports Cars of the World", Peterson Publishing, 1971.
Great Magazine IMHO with lots of great sports car content.

But the article on the 71S had this to say re: waving,
(reprinted here without permission, I suppose)



note: some serious flame bait re: 914 and 912 owners deleted :)
this is definately a PERIOD piece and does not necessarily represent
my views.  It's also not very accurate is it credits the
71S with 200HP.




"Porsche owners have this thing.  They wave at each other.  Not
the real "arm waggler" salute from the days of your--heaven forbid--but
a subtle lift of four fingers from the steering wheel.

"The type of wave depends on which Porsche you're driving too".

>>> flame bait deleted <<<<

"The 911 owner is on the threshold of dignity.  He must show a reserved
facade. He lifts his fingers to attention for a brief moment, his face
sober, glancing at the oncoming driver from the corner of his eye.

"But the king... ah the king with the 911S remains as aloof as possible.
A slight twitch of the index finger with a cool concentration on the road
ahead will suffice.  After all, he must maintain the stature that's
demanded of anyone driving the ultimate in motor cars, right?
(if the man should own a 917 he does not have to waive at anyone)".

"The S at the end is a status symbol that even the non-Porschephile
must respect.  Here is one of the few remaining *real* performance
cars.  And it's easy to drive as well.

"There aren't many 911S Porsches around which enhances their prestige.
At almost 10 grand apiece, it's not surprising.  But the demand
is high.  Porsche-Audi Pacific, the western states distributor,
doesn't even have one available... that's how scarce these little
jewels are.

"The Porsche is one of the cars in the world that ranks high with
everyone.  It's mentioned in the same breath with Ferrari-although
neither the Ferrari or Porsche owner would consider the other in the
same league".


>>> note: lot's of driving impressions of the 71S deleted for brevity, but
I can't resist this one:

"The 911S makes even the worst driver look good.  It goes where it's
pointed, accelerates with the best of them, and stops quicker
than Detroit Iron landing in a crash barrier".  :)

>>>  the article finishes with:

"For those few days I had with the "S" I felt transformed into a
clique that believes in cameraderie.  It was refreshing to have
all those people wave a greeting as I tooled around the streets.
I quit worring about who was going to ambush me at the next cross
street, or that fellow up ahead who's weaving lane to lane, or the
woman who's making a left turn from the right line.  I was at peace...
all because of some stranger I'll never meet, who smiled and
raised four fingers above the steering wheel."
