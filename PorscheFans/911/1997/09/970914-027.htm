Well, despite my best preparations, I was left by the side of the road yesterday, on my way to Snowmass.  After nearly 3 years my '75 911S Targa
project car was running!  Complete engine rebuild by the local P-wrench shop; and they replaced any questionable parts including fuel distributor, all new fuel injectors, etc.  Took it in last week for the 1000 mile check including oil change, retorque heads, adjust valves.  It had been missing occasionally for the past couple hundred miles.  Sort of stuttering for just a moment with loss of power.  The tach would swing wildly when it happened, and then it would just pick up where it left off.  This usually happened when warmed up, at cruising speed (70mph), every 10-15 minutes or so.  I told the P-wrench about my concern BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE THE KIND OF THING THAT IF IT GOT MUCH WORSE COULD LEAVE ME BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD! Having been a former fan of Fiat 850s, I DO have experience with that sort of thing, but at least with the Fiat, and the 1965 356  that I had owned previously, I could do a lot of the diagnosis and work on the car myself.  The 911 mechanicals is out of lea!
gue, at least for now.  (I hope 
to try the valve adjustment in about 10,000 miles or so, thanks to the P-fans who responded to my request for info).  I had a '70 914 years ago and never could figure out the fuel injection!  At any rate, I ended up bringing the car back to  my trusted P-wrench  who put in a new Permatune CDI box.  The car seemed to be running great at first, but after 50 miles or so started to burp and backfire intermittently.  Still, it was beautiful day with the top off, Aspens changing.  The next morning, I took off for a beautiful drive along the crystal river up to Redstone -- highly recommended for Targa and cabriolet owners.  I doesn't get any better!  More coughing and backfiring, then suddenly the 911 just died.

I remembered when I was in highschool (early '70s) seeing an occasional 911 by the side of the road.  My Dad always had the same cryptic remark, about the factory emergency tool kit supposedly containing a cyanide capsule. . . I think it must have been a reference to Hitler's officers supposedly having always carried a cyanide capsule to take in case of imminent capture by the Allies.  

I was able to push the car out of harms way.  After cooling down for 20 minutes or so I could get the engine fire up for a brief moment, but it would promptly die.  I did have some good luck besides the beautiful day.
My wife was NOT with me.  I WAS in cell phone range, and AAA DID arrive after a while with a nice flatbed to take me to the local foreign car garage, which did come well recommemded by the locals I spoke with.  

P-Fans, my question is this: What ELSE can go wrong to leave you by the side of the road?  I feel like I've gone to a lot of trouble to assure that this car is as reliable as possible.  Yes, I know it's not a Honda.  Any suggestions/similar stories?  I'll find out this week (hopefully) what this particular problem turned out to be.
