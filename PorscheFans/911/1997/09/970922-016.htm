Let me support Warren with my experience in this area.  

In my "previous" car, which had a hydraulically-operated clutch, the clutch
pedal would often become rock hard and not depress at times, when in slow
traffic.  Interestingly, even a little air flow in the (front) engine
compartment caused by the car moving forward would immediately free the
pedal action.

Turned out to be a defective rubber hose from the master cylinder to the
slave cylnder.... apparently, engine heat would cause the inner core of the
hose to collapse, blocking the flow of fluid.  Replacing the hose cured the
problem permanently.  

I never cut the nose open to verify, but i suspect there must have been a
pinhole in the inner core of the hose, causing the brake fluid to travel
between the inner & outer parts of the hose ... the heat must have caused
the hole to swell enough to pass the fluid.

So, collapse of your brake lines may not be a static condition you can check
by simple inspection: it may be induced by heat (ie: from using the brakes).

Hope this is of help,
