Porschefans please help,

I'm about to make the jump into Porsche ownership and among several cars under
consideration is what looks like an 86 widebody 911 coupe, guards red,
sunroof, tan leather interior, electric seats, the works!

The dealer tells me that it is actually a '78 SC which has an 86 interior and
an '84 3.2litre engine.  He was caught out by a wholesaler from whom he bought
the car sight unseen as an 86 widebody.  The car is definitely an import into
Australia so I seek the help of Porschefans to verify what they are telling
me.

The Engine # is:  64G01200 
Chassis # is:  9118201732

My questions are:-
1)  is this a '78 SC "done up", in which case is the widebody aftermarket?
2)  what year is the engine and what is it's capacity and horsepower?
3)  is there anything I should look for to check if the car has been built
properly.

Normally I wouldn't consider buying a car with such a checkered history and
the other cars I am looking at are 81/82 SC's with original everything but
this thing just looks a million dollars and there is a possibility of picking
it up for a bargain because the dealer got stung so your help would be
appreciated.

Thanks in advance
