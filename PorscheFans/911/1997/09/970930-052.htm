Hi,

A friend of mine is looking at 911 and he wanted to know the differences
between a '95 and a '96 911. We both know that the'96 has a better
induction system which has more hp and torque and it has an integrated
3rd brake light instead of the basket handle. Are there other
differences I can tell him about? 

He would like to know if there is a big difference in performance that
would justify the difference in price. I should probably notes that he
is interested in attending PCA driver's ed when he buys his car.

Would anyone who went contemplated buying a '95 or '96 911 like to share
their thoughts?

Thanks,

Neil Kumpers
