Hey CA pcar fans,

Attached is an email from Kopp on SB42.  It's through the house
and through the Senate.  It's now up to Ol' Pete.  Time for
an all out E-mail effort!  Wouldn't it be cool if Pete was a
sports car fan, but that would require having a pulse or some
passion, and frankly kids, it would not appear likely :)

note:  Kopp says: "Governor's e-mail address is www.gov.ca.gov"
which is obviously wrong and even the URL is wrong.  The correct
one is "www.gov.ca" if you want to browse around the CA Gov site.

If you want to e-mail Pete, use:

PeteWilson@ca.gov

Vol

71T with 3.2 CIS set up to look like a 74S: no smog gear, SSI and
early exhaust.  And for those that might scorn me for no smog
gear my answer is that it runs a lot cleaner today than it did
with the 2.2T motor and the Zenith boat anchors.

        	Thank you for your e-mail regarding SB 42.  Your support
        is much appreciated.

        	SB 42 was approved by the State Senate today, 36-1.
        Senator Tom Hayden was the one lone no vote.  Last week, the
        Assembly Appropriations Committee adopted amendments to SB 42
        which freeze the 25-year and older smog check exemption for five
        years, at which time the exemption becomes a rolling, 30-year
        exemption.  In other words, the bill moves the current 1965
        exemption year cutoff forward to 1973 and maintains that
        exemption year until 2003.  The amendments were promulgated by
        the committee.  Obviously, I prefer the previous version of the
        bill.  Notwithstanding the committee amendments, passage of the
        bill represents a substantial victory.

        	Please continue to convey your worthy support to
        Governor Pete Wilson and urge him to sign SB 42 into law. The
        Governor's e-mail address is www.gov.ca.gov
        You may leave a phone message at 916-445-2841.
        Or, you may FAX him at 916-445-4633.

        					Sincerely yours,

        					QUENTIN L. KOPP
