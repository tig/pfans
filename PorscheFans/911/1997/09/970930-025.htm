After learning lots about suspension adjustment and coming very close to a good
corner balance *and* ride height evenness, I have ended up with one problem,
although relatively minor.  The rear sway bar has about 1/4" preload, which
changes the corner balances (diagonal weights) by about 1%.  All suspension
components are stock so there is no adjustability for this.  Clearly it is not
a big deal but having this final thing adjustable over a small range would be
very nice.  (In looking over the PO's records, I also noticed that the rear
sway bar mounts have been replaced a few times so I think I need to assume
those weren't the last, so adjustability is a good idea to compensate for
slight inaccuracies in welding the mounts.) 

So -- has anyone attempted, or know of, a way to introduce some adjustability
into the rear sway bar mounting?  The drop links are quite short and use 12mm
bolts so there isn't much room there, but I don't think I'd mind lowering the
sway bar a little (like, 1/2"?) if that meant it allowed room for a threaded
drop link.

Some day I'll write up my experiences (it's been a *learning* experience more
than anything, and useful, I think, for anyone contemplating suspension
adjustment).  Bottom line, it isn't that hard *once* you know how and have the
tools :-).  I personally never got a single source for everything I needed and
all the little warnings and tips...
