Ross:

I expect that your "flame" was directed to my question about the Adjustable
Fuel Pressure Regulator -  it was the only post today about engine
performance modifications (aside from the K&N thread) and you specifically
mention "..just bolting on the latest "trick new" stuff (... fuel pressure
regulator, etc.,. ". 

Just to clear the air from your smoke:
You should never assume that the author of a question just wants to burn $
in their quest for elusive gains in horsepower.  To that end, I'll answer
the questions you should have asked (before you assumed I was looking for
an easy "bolt on" cure), for example:

John's response
I have headers/Triad exhaust system. Both intake and exhaust have been
matched and tuned (see next point).

John's response
Boy are you right.  For this, I have a MAF (and, oh my gosh, with a K&N)
and the DME has been custom programmed (not "off-the-shelf) in fuel
delivery, timing, etc..  Oh yea, and the throttle body is bored by 3mm.

Based on the above, yep, I think increasing fuel pressure is reasonable
next step.  Sorry if you don't agree.  But I thought this was a list where
people shared experience, suggestions and advice - rather than "shooting
from the lip"..  BTW, I got my 

Flame on....
