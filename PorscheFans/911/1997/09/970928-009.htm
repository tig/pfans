I assume there are > 80% highway miles? Early 911s are not pleasant in
stop & go traffic situations. If your climate has is wet (cool/rain)
then you should know the ventilation systems are primative. Since you're
interested in a targa,(which I assume means you're in a warm, dry
climate) fogged windows probably are not a concern. I would think an E
or T would be best for your purpose. The S-es are more powerful above
about 90 mph. You may want to install modern seats for increased comfort
and safety. Cloth Reccaros are a major improvement.

You should get 20-25 mpg.  Assuming the mechanicals are in good
condition, these cars are quite reliable. The condition of the wiring
harness(es) is important as well.  They are simple in some respects (no
power anything). Major service (tune-ups, valve adjustment) are 6000
mile items. Oil/filter changes are at 3000 mile intervals. Parts are not
horrifically expensive for German cars and are readily available. 

However, these are 25 year old used cars. 

But once a component has been replaced/repaired, it will last.  If the
car is in excellent mechanical condition it will be reliable.  A proper
engine top-end rebuild should last at least 60-70 K miles and the
motor's bottom  should be good for 3 to 4 times longer. The suspension
bushings last about 60 -80K miles as well so don't forget about these.
Then there's the oil lines which should be inspected as they harden and
become brittle... the same goes for 25 year old fuel lines, and brake
hoses. 




> Also, is there anything that I should look for in particular when looking at a used 911? 

I would look for an excellent example of a 73 1/2 car. Next would be the
70-72 cars. Rust is a real worry. Look at the codition of the body
rubber seals. Old, craked seals increase the risk of hidden rust. 

Documentation as to repairs and service history is very valuable. 

For a daily driver, you must get the car inspected by a Porsche mechanic
who knows early 911s. Whatever this costs in hassle and $$ has the
potential of saving you ten-fold in the future.

The best car would be one with an excellent body and interior but with
tired mechanicals. You could supervise the mechanical restoration and
know it was done properly. Then the car shold be reliable for years.
