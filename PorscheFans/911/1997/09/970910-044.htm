Mine is cut just above the wire holes.  Big hole cut with a plasma
cutter, not those cute circles most people cut out with a holesaw.  The
hole follows the back countour of the headlight bucket, with the bucket
making a wide funnel into the oil cooler area.  My car is a street car,
so I just remove the headlight assembly to allow airflow.  I plan to get
some wire mesh to make a screen to protect against a rock puncturing the
Carrera cooler I installed.
