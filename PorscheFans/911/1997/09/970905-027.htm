Greetings P-nuts,

Here's the latest that I've been able to pull off of the Sacramento Website
regarding SB-42.  The bill appears to be alive and well...something (that
appears to be good) went down yesterday, to the tune of 20 "ayes" and 1
"no"...

I'm not sure what the "do pass as amended" means...does that mean as
amended back in February? or would this be a NEW amendment? (which is NOT
indicated below)  I was NOT able to access the web portion containing bill
status and history (I kept getting this smarmy "OK, an error has occured"
message)  Can anyone shed any light on this?

Anyway...those of us out here in the land of fruits and nuts...keep
writing/faxing/calling these people!

Below is just a straight cut & paste from the site

Cheers
