Subject: koni shocks

<<is it possible to adjust koni red shocks on the car
without losing alinment?>>

All shocks (Koni's included) mount so they have no affect on the vehicle's
wheel alignment. One end is firmly mounted to the vehicles body/chassis; the
other end  attaches to the movable portion of the suspension arm. The shock
(more accurately "spring damper") counteracts the oscillating motion of the
vehicle springs.

If you can compress the shock completely on the vehicle, by all means do so.
If you have to remove one end or both ends to compress the shock to adjust it
this should not change the alignment. Some Koni gas shocks (yellow) may have
to be removed to adjust. On these shocks, there is a button on top of the
housing that you must also depress. On other yellow Koni's, you rotate an
adjustment screw in the shock stem using the supplied adjustment tool (knob).

If you have a big knob on the outside of the shock tube you're very
fortunate. You can adjust either or both jounce and/or rebound rates with
this adjuster. These are rare and expensive shocks $$$$$.
