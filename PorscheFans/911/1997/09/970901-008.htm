Harley Myler:

At "Spring Thing" (a three day Porsche event put on by Smokey Mountain
Region), I saw two Porsches that had been modified by Knoxville
Supercharging.  One, an early modification, was shown in the Concours. 
The installation was clean and the engine compartment was not crowded. 
I was visually impressed.  I did not drive either car so I cannot report
on the performance.

One of the principals in Knoxville Supercharging is Mike Parker.  Mike
was chair of the Ashville Parade, and he and his wife, Suzan Bowman,
have been either event chairs or registrar at "Spring Thing" for a
number of years.  Suzan won her class at this year's Parade Autocross.  

Mike is a detail person.  If I were interested in supercharging a
Porsche, I would not hesitate to contact him or Knoxville Supercharging.
