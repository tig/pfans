>I have read several messages re:car covers, but I'm trying to find some more
>specific info if possible.  I live in a very foggy part of San Francisco and
>I need a cover that will protect my car not only on the sunny days, but also
>from the dew/fog.  Can anyone recommend this type of cover?  I have an older
>cover which came w/the car when I bought it, but it leaves a layer of grime
>on the car (defeats the point of covering it, especially when the car has
>just been washed!)
>
>I also need to recover my steering wheel, I would like to do it myself but
>I'm not sure how difficult it is going to be.  Can someone give me some
>insight?  It seems pretty straight forward, but I don't want to find out the
>hard way.  Also, is there any particular type of cover to use or place I
>should by it.

>One final request:  I bought my P-car last may and the last owner said it has
>many consistencies of a Weissach edition (i.e. Metallic Black paint, sport
>seats, 930 dash, larger tires 7's in front & 8's in back).  Now I'm quite
>certain it is not a Weissach due to the fact it is a Targa and has no tail,
>but how can I get the history?  Do I need to write to the factory and give
>them the VIN?  Is there a number I could call instead of writing?  Could this
>have been a special order at the time?  I basically want to find out if it is
>possibily worth any more money. Any suggestions?
