Nil,

1. What they mate to are nylon web straps that pass through the seat
mounting rails (they are hollow) and     then clip to the back of them.  I
have them and the mats are rock solid;  don't move at all.

2. Probably the PO had a cell phone?

3.  It does restrict airflow a suprizing amount.  I get much frostier with
mine removed.
