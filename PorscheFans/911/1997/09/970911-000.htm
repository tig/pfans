BloombergP:

If you remove 300 pounds from a 2500-pound car with 200 peak HP, you 
increase the peak-power-to-weight ratio from 1:12.5 to 1:11... A 
13.5% improvement.

This is "equivalent" to a 13.5% increase in power... That is, you'd 
have the same peak-power-to-weight ratio if you left the car alone 
and boosted the motor to 227 HP.  I put "equivalent" in quotes 
because peak horsepower isn't necessarily indicative of a car's 
performance... The total area under the torque curve is a much more 
useful number.  You get the idea, though.

A lower final-drive ratio gives you faster acceleration in each
gear, but for your particular application (0-60 MPH), lowering the
final-drive ratio will HURT your times, since you'll need to shift
to 3rd gear at around 55 MPH... With the stock ratio, second gear is
good for about 65 MPH on a stock 911.

My guess is that a 2500-pound 911 with a 200-HP motor (and the stock
final-drive ratio) can do 0-60 in about 5.8 seconds; the same car,
300 pounds lighter, should be able to do it in about 5.4... Whether
that's a seat-of-the-pants difference that you can feel is dependent
on the sensitivity of your seat.
