    Bill:

    Yeah, it does... Although if you double-clutch your upshifts and
    get the timing exactly right, the 1-2 shift can be performed VERY
    quickly, with no grinding.

    If your rev-matching's off, of course, very quick upshifts into
    second gear will grind REAL bad... So it's proably the better
    part of valor to make that shift relatively slowly.

    Or you can do what I do:  Every time you grind the gears, toss a
    five-dollar bill in the glovebox... By the time you have enough
    money in there for a tranny rebuild, you'll need one.

    Power shifting (shifting without disengaging the clutch or
    lifting the throttle) is bad for nearly ALL transmissions...
    Even if you stab at the clutch between shifts, you shouldn't
    expect any transmission to enjoy being shifted with the throttle
    wide open.

    The only area where the 901 is weaker than most other
    transmissions is first gear; it's only supported on one side, so
    any attempt to put large torques through it may break it.  This
    means no drag-style standing starts, and no downshifting into
    first gear while the car's moving.

    There are two reasons for that:

    1.  At low revs, the difference between the engine speed in
        first gear and the engine speed in second gear is pretty
        small, so the synchros don't have to work very hard to
        equalize the rotation speeds.

    2.  If you're shifting at low revs, you're proably not driving 
        very spiritedly, so you're probably not trying to shift very 
        quickly, anyway.

    The downside is that you can't GET a really fast 0-60 time if you
    start in second gear.

    You've got a '71 911E, which doesn't make a huge amount of
    torque... So you may not be able to get a decent launch in
    second gear without slipping the clutch.

    Slipping the clutch, even "infrequently", will cause wear.
    Whether that wear is "excessive" is for you to determine, but the
    clutch certainly won't last as long as it would if you NEVER
    slipped it.
