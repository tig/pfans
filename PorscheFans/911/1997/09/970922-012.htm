Hi,

Yesterday while out for a very pleasant drive in my new-to-me '90 C2,
I encountered a strange ventilation fan problem.

The fan was on position 1, A/C turned off, and all of a sudden the fan
developed a mind of it's own, switching from on high to on low (and I think
various positions in between as well), changing speed every 2 to 10 seconds
or so. The fan switch had no effect - even at position 0 it didn't turn
the fan off at this point.

I pulled over thinking that I might reset it by shutting the car off. Instead,
I was greeted by a "Thunk Thunk Thunk Thunk" noise from the vicinity of the
dash - sort of a hollow knocking sound NOT like any relay I've ever heard
before. The frequency of this noise was 2 or 3 Thunks per second (TPS). The
fan was NOT on while the Thunking was happening (it stopped when the ignition
was switched off)

Pulling the blower fuse (fuse #1) and putting it back in seemed to fix the
problem, and it hasn't reoccurred.

Has anyone run across something like this? I'm concerned because if it starts
'Thunking' on it's own when I'm not there, I assume the battery will drain
fairly quickly.

Thanks!
