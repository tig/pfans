The latest thing on the knocking sound on my 87 Carrera is that the noise
is coming from either the rod bearing that went bad or a loose rod bolt of
cylinder 5. The mechanic seems to have ruled out all other obvious
possibilities. At this point is open it up and see.

The mysterious thing is that this problem happened apparently by itself
while the engine sat waiting for the transmission work to be completed. How
can that possibly be? The shop is willing to work with me on this one, but
whatever the problem really is it sounds expensive. I have no doubt
whatsoever they are honest, but I wonder whether they are responsibe (since
it happened while the car was in the shop) or not.

Any insight would be appreciated.


Gabriel
