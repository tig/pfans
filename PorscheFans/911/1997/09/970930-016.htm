<<While these thoughts begin to cross my mind I could use some help. Does

anyone have or know where I can find a good guide to winterizing a 911 for

winter storage? Any help will be much appreciated.>>

Brian,
I'm sure I'll miss something, so I'll forward this to the list as well so
that others can chime in.  If I were storing my car all winter I would (in no
particualr order)
1. put the car up on jack stands and remove the tires
2. thoroughly clean the car inside & out (wax/leather protectant/etc.,
including putting a moisture remover in the interior)
3. top off the gas tank and change the oil
4. disconnect the battery (or buy a quality (Schumacher) battery charger and
plug it in)
5. put wood blocks underneath the windshield wipers
6. leave the doors partially open (to keep the seals from being compressed
all winter)
7. throw a car cover over it

Like I said, this is a start - I'm sure I've forgotten something.
Regards,
Brian Buxton
