Well, the extra neddies have an effect and the appearance is hardly over
the top.  The interior treatment has  been available on 911s for decades.
I've seen a red and a silver Turbo S and they were both very purposeful
vehicles, neither had the appearance of 'too much' and the interior was not
overdone (both had black interiors with the 'carbon' dash.)  I'd be
interested to see Mr Porsche suggest that the extra dollars and extra sex
of the S doesn't result in better straight line performance.  I'm sure
their traditionally conservative numbers reflect at least marginal gains.
After all, at those prices, we're not talking about a price-conscious
market, so they need to have the value in the car's uniqueness, not in its
performance edge of the 'ordinary' TT.  Personally, I would crawl over
broken glass, dragging myself by my lips to own and drive either car on a
daily basis.  For me, a C4S with a Ruf (710hp) engine replacement is the
next logical step -- cheaper, faster than a superbike and more 'personal.'

Cheers

Adam
ps.  If you _ever_ call a Turbo a 'pimpmobile' again, I'll never let my
girls work for you again!
