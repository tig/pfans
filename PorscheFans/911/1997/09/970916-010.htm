Hi fans,

I've got a little problem with my left taillight, it's fuse keeps burning
through.
A couple of months back there was someone who had the same problem and
suggested to replace the diode that was behind the lightswitch.
Now I face a new problem, the previous owner of my car must have been quite
paranoia (judging from the number of anti-theft/alarm gadgeds installed...
real profi stuff by the way), and had, among others, thick metal sheets
mounted/rivetted underneath the dashboard (I guess to prevent anyone from
hotwireing the car).
It's been installed so darn good that now I'll have to take half the dash
appart to get to that diode behind the lightswitch (GRRRRR...).
I took a good look at it, but I can't seem to figure out how to take of the
'bumpstrip' on the lower part of the dashboard. So far I've discovered one
screw near the driver side door, but, that's all I could find.
Some advise from one of the 'dash-experts' would be greatly apreciated!
TIA
