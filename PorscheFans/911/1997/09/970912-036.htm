Don:

I've got a deal through a company called Titan Laboratories... 
They charge me $8 per sample, provide 24-hour turnaround, keep 
detailed records on each of the cars under my care all the way back 
to Day 1, perform both wear metal analysis and physical/chemical 
tests of the oil itself, and they telephone me immediately if during 
testing they discover something drastically wrong with a sample.

They provide all the sample-taking hardware, sample bottles, and
self-addressed boxes... Plus some very good literature describing
their testing process and the interpretation of their results.

As I tell people every time the subject comes up, Titan is one of
the best companies, in ANY industry, that I've ever dealt with.

Titan Labs is in Denver, Colorado... They can be reached at
800 848-4826 or 303 893-3211 (fax: 303 595-8741).

P.S.  The $8 price I mentioned is for a relatively large volume of
      business... Their regular price for no-minimum-order (i.e.,
      one-time) analysis is in the $15-$19 range.

      However, the last time I recommended Titan Labs here on the
      list, Stephen Jagernauth called them and had the following
      experience (I'm quoting from his public e-mail):

          "I called them on Monday .... I finally spoke to Melissa
          in Sales. .... she informed me the price for 1-time use is
          $18.95 and $14.95 if purchased in lots of 10.    When I
          inquired about the $8 deal, she said that was probably
          through a reseller or business.

          "I was surprised to get a call today from Melissa.  She
          said she spoke to her boss and he approved the $8 price as
          a 1-time only deal for "Internet" people for a limited
          time.   I don't know if this is a sales pitch or what, but
          if you're interested, mention you read about them on the
          Internet in order to get the $8 price with  no minimum
          order.    I suggest you ask for Melissa in Sales since she
          is the one handling this."

      That was almost exactly a year ago, but the people at Titan
      are SO cool that they might be willing to give you the same
      price even now.

      Ask for Melissa Bailey (or Melissa Moberly; I think she
      married recently), tell her where you heard about Titan, and
      see what they say.  Even if you have to pay the full price, I
      GUARANTEE that you'll be pleased with their service.
