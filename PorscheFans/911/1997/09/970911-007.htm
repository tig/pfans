Denny,

Enjoyed your story about the Turbo S launching.  While I can't address
what that must feel like, I'd like to pose another question to the
911 fans out there:

Reading all I have about the new 993 Turbo S, it appears that for an
additional $50K (!) you get the vent hole in the rear fenders, yellow
calipers, a host of leather interior touches, and approximately 40 or
50 more horses.

Question:  What is the factory doing to net the additional hp gains?
           Larger twin turbos, more radical cams, a tweek to the Varioram
           intake?

There's a SUPER story on the web from a gentleman (Ben McDaniel) who was lucky
enough to have been in one.  Please reference:

Subject: Turbo's, Oh what a feeling 

I was behind a TurboS the other day on the freeway in Dallas.
Admiring the wide rolling fenders, big poking dual exhaust, shiny red finish,
wide monster 
meats all tucked up inside the fenders, Super-Model Blonde Girl friend ?  when
all of a sudden he launched the thing!
We were doing about 80 and he was so far gone in ~4 sec. you couldn't even tell
what it color it was.
Please no hate mail about racing we we're just keeping up. Honest
The Question is could someone who owns one of these marvels please describe to
the rest
of us in exacting detail what that must feel like? Not the blonde, 930 and any
other specially prepped owners as well.
It was just awesome to visualize. Forget the Turbo Look Posting...Now seeking
90's turbo/super
