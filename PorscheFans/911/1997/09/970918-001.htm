Martin,

I have an 81 SC so my experience should be close to yours. The largest 'grief'
you will get is with the sport shocks. I have sport Bilsteins and they are to
stiff IMHO. Larger sway bays are great 'bang for the buck' as they flatten the
car greatly and do not contribute much to ride harshness. The hard compound
bushings will also give you a lot of noise and harshness. The setup you are
describing is close to a race setup - I hope your roads are smooth :-) 
Remember everyone's tolerance for harshness is different and what my feel 
good for ten minutes can be very tiring on a long drive.

I don't want to start a suspension philosophy debate but a fellow in our region
auto crosses his early 911 with worn out shocks, stock torsion bars, and no
sway bars but with R1's. And he whoops us guys with the hard suspensions
and street tires. He's great fun to watch as you swear the car will roll over
but he just sticks. I sometimes feel with the huge amount of camber change
we get with our suspensions that a flat cornering attitude is over rated.
