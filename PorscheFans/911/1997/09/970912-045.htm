Fans-
	I've enjoyed the thread about waving. I don't wave, rather I give two quick
taps on the horn, and most of the time get no response. No offense
water-cooled drivers, but I just honk at the air-cooled cars, even the 914's.

	I have noticed another far more disturbing trend. Many of us have daily
drivers, and save the P-car for the weekends. Do you notice a difference in
how other drivers treat you from one car to the other? In my 911, I get
cut-off and  tailgated so much, I feel like leaving the car in the garage. It
also seems people just love to pull out right in front of you, even if it
means running a stop sign or even a red light. Anyone else notice this?
	I am also looking for muffler recommendations. I've heard good and bad about
the Bursch, but nothing about the Ansa. Improved performance would be nice,
but a quality sound is the most important thing to me. A little louder is OK,
but not too much-(I'm attracting too much negative attention already). I will
be getting SSI's, but don't need a stainless muffler. TIA
