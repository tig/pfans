Gary Cuozzo asks a couple of assorted questions for the list.  All apply
to a 1980 911SC.



3.  I have changed the oil a number of times, and have never replaced =
the washers on the drain plugs.  The reason is that everytime I order =
the washer set, they don't fit.  The ones on my plugs are aluminum =
looking and are fairly thick rings with a thin "sidewall" and fit =
perfectly.  The ones I keep getting are thin copper washers with a =
smaller opening and don't fit over the threads on my drain plugs.  What =
gives?  Everytime I order them, they tell me these are the right ones, =
but they never are.  Do I have some kind of non-original plugs?  They =
are both the same (tank & sump).

Your old ones are still doing the job, right?  Why worry.  If a big
hardware store or a speed shop which carries Earls or Aeroquip fittings
doesn't have aluminum or copper washers of the right size, try Pegasus
(800-688-6946) - they won't know what fits Porsche's, but give them the
ID size.

4.  I have a front mounted cooler in my car.  Is there a way to drain =
the oil from the cooler as well as the tank & sump?  It seems that with =
every change, there is always that couple or quarts of oil that can't be =
drained.  Even if I did it only once a year, at least then I would have =
a "complete" oil change and then "partial" changes in between.  Any =
thoughts?

You must be a masochist, though I bet it has occurred to all of us do it
yourselfers.  Factory does not say this is needed.  If you change oil
before it is thick black sludge, not that much old oil is up there (couple of
quarts) compared to the sumps.  To do it you either need to remove the
entire front cooler system including the long pipes and drain it, or you
need to disconnect both long pipes at the thermostat back in the rear and
blow air through (maybe you could suction it out - same difference).  
ake a look up there and figure out how you are going to disconnect those
fittings, where you are going to put your oil drain pan, etc.  Those fittings
are notorious for seizing on the thermostat (see Automotion catalog for a
way to try to fix buggered threads on expensive thermostat housing - if
they sell it, it happens often.  Did to me).   If you were clever you might
figure out a way to disconnect something easier to get to and deal with,
but problem is, that's a thermostat, and when it is closed (its temperature
not above about 160-180F), all or most of the air you blow in there will
just go through the thermostat and right back without moving the oil from
the front.  If you just disconnect in the front fender well, you make a
mess and don't get the oil out of the long lines.  Now, maybe you could
take the lines out and braze on some petcocks to allow you to do this? 
Careful, the lines are some special sort of brass.  Let me know if this is
worth it if you engineer something.  Seriously, only time this is really
worth while is if your engine blew up and you need to flush the little
pieces out.  At that point you probably want to take the whole thing out
of the car so you can not just drain it, but flush it.  Hope this never
happens to you - no fun.  

5.  Anybody know the size and type of the socket needed to remove the
bolts on the CV joints.  I haven't done this in a couple of years and 
when I did, I borrowed it from a friend.  If I remember correctly, it 
wasn't just an allen type, but a star configuration (or am I thinking of
the flywheel?).

Your's are probably 6mm regular hexagonal Allens.  But you should just
look.  Some cars (including I think some 944s, plus Vws,) have used a 12
point Allen (also I think a 6mm).  But I just grab my well worn ones (and
my only small 12 pointer if I need that - Automotion sells this) out of my
tool box and have never really learned the Allens by size.  I kind of like
the 12 pointers.  But they are hard to come by for a retrofit.  For either
kind, pry the crud out of the hole before putting the tool in, and you will
be less likely to end up with a stripped socket.   The flywheel bolts are
also 12 pointers, but much bigger - 12mm bolts vs 8mm for the Cvs.

Nordstern's website has an FAQ which has a great article on Cvs
generally.

Cvs)
