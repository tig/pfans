i totally agree.... the K&N unit is a fad... i have one on my C4 and it's
not something that you could  *really* notice .. i like it because it makes
the engine compartment a bit more open and i can still adjust my Koni's
without taking the car apart.. it also gives a bit of a noise.. which in my
book is a plus... i'd say that the only power gain is from the lighter
weight of the filter compaired to the weight if the intake box... ;-)

it's not like the engineers at porsche forgot to make the airbox big enough
to flow air to the engine...
