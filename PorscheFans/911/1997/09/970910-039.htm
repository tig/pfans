Subject: 
A couple of easy (for someone, I hope) questions:

1)  What is the difference between the Bosch O2 sensor I can buy at the
local
parts store for $20 and the "Lambda sensor" sold by Automotion and others
for
$100 or more?  Parts store tells me this $20 model is the one designated
for
an 83 911SC.

O2 sensor and Lambda sensor are two names for the same thing.  Where do you
get one for $20?!

2)  On the CIS system on my 83 SC, there is something called a
decceleration
valve.  What does this thing do?  A couple of years ago, the local shop
adjusted my idle and plugged the vacuum line to this thing, noting that it
was "slow".  How important can it be if it can be disconnected with no
result?  Or, should they not have disconnected it?  I have a great book on
fuel injection by someone named Norbye, and nowhere in the description of
the
K-Jetronic system does he mentioned this valve.

The decel valve sprays fuel into the intake while the engine is
decelerating.  The purpose is to provide some fuel to keep the mixture
rich, and thereby lower the cylinder temperature.  This lowers the NOX
emissions.  It should not affect the engine, although engine braking is
more effective if the valve is disabled.  The air is bad enough!  If you
live in a conjested area, keep your pollution gear fixed, please.

These aren't car-disabling questions -- just curious.
