Hey P-fans
Had the alternator rebuilt diodes ? or something like that he said ,sand
blasted brushes. I forget what exactly he said but it was charging @ 14.5
when I left. Got it all back together & everything seems to be ok except the
alternator light is coming on when it is idling at about 700. Where should it
be idling at?  He said (the mechanic) a bad regulator may cause the wires to
the diodes to fry like they did I need to have it checked now. So where is it
guys. Is that whole cluster of stuff on the left in the corner.Sorry to sound
so lost, but we'll catch on. I also need a rear view mirror, chrome type.
Where do I start looking.Oh yeah the horn isn't working, almost got hit by a
John Deere today (yeah a tractor).
  

Thanks
