Paul,

I speak from experience, the only 7" rims you can use on the back of
the early narrow bodied cars are wheels with the 911R offset.  I don't
know what the exact offset is, but the Fuch  part number is
901.361.012.05.  If they are authentic wheels, the number is printed
on the back.  I just sold the wheels I had.  My 73 Targa has a battle
scar of the left rear fender from turn 12 at Road Atlanta from the
tire rubbing by using the wrong 7" rims.  A friend just purchased a
set of 6x16/7x16 wheels for his 72, and the left rear rubbed and
started bubbling the paint.

I would be leery of a wheel that had been widened.  I know someone in
Orlando that machines the center out of a Fuch then makes a three
piece wheel.  As far as I know, he can make them any offset or width.

John
