Early reports on the Firestone tires have been very good, and someone I
know personally has driven an F-body with them and was impressed. The
negative comments seem to be attributed to the general dislike
(deservedly so) of the rest of the Firestone line.

Tire Rack deals are good/bad depending on where you live. When I lived in
larger cities (Chicago, Detroit) the tire selection was greater and
prices were lower. Here in Louisville, good prices are only found on
off-brand tires, and every store I called would have to special-order the
Dunlops I wanted, with no real price break. I was very satisfied with
Tire Rack.

Haven't heard about the Toyo FZ4, but Toyos are standard on some
family-type imports. Why not get the D40M2s for under $100/tire? I like
them on my 911 and will buy them at replacement time, but I am
considering the SP8000s or the SZ50s for my SHO since I don't want
directional tires (FWD cars need the tire rotations!).
