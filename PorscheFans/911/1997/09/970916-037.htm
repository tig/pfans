Pins are probably held in by rust grunge and friction unless they are
non original pins.  there should be hole for the retaining clips on the
inside (big) end of the pins but they could be rotated so you cant see
then or the may not be driven all the way in.

Pins drive out towards the inside of the car.  Use a small drift punch. 
Watch that you don't loose the spring plate when the pin comes out.
