I experienced the same problems with my 1971 911S.

TUBES/VALVES:  My car would not last more than a day or two before one
or more tubes would go flat inside the new Yokohamas.  The Porsche
dealer was of no help.  The Porsche parts place claimed to have the
right special valves, but their $4.50/each valves looked identical to
the freebies at the tire dealer and did not work.  Eventually, we tried
valves that were for "Trucks or certain Volkswagens" and they have
worked fine for over a year of road use and 20+ autocrosses/time trials.
 They did not look like they fit well (inside the Fuchs rim), but I've
only had one leaky valve in 3 sets of tires!

BALANCING:  I've watch the tire shop balance the tires to "zero", then
gone out and driven the car for a mile or two, returned to the shop with
a shimmy, and then seen the tires show up as imbalanced on the same
machine that showed a perfect balance 10 minutes ago!  Its happened with
several sets of tires, different brands of tire, and with different
workers.  They always have a difficult time getting the tires on the
Fuchs (especially the BFG R1's) and it always takes several attempts
over several days to finally get the tires balanced (thereafter they
stay balanced).  So I've tentatively concluded that they use so much
soapy goop that the tire shifts on the rim, which takes several days to
dry out (next set of tires I'll mark the rim and tires to test this
theory).
