 Garth_Gregoire@capgroup.com asks this, among other things:

Hi everyone,
I've got a couple of questions: (1971 911T)
1.  My transmission shifts "up" through the gears very well.  Going from
first to second is the only place that I encounter any problems.  Unless I
let the RPMS drop way down (IE hold the clutch in for several seconds)
and
then make the shift, it grinds.  Also downshifting from 3rd to 2nd does
the
same thing.  When I go from 2nd to 1st the car has to be almost at a stop.
Does this sound like Syncros?  It is a 901 Transmision in a 71 911T.  I'd
like to make my shifting smoother if at all possible.  Any
suggestions/ideas?  What would it cost me to get a 915 tranny and have
it
installed?  What about a rebuild for a 901?

My suggestions:  1) keep your 901.  you only need a 915 if you add quite
a bit more power.  2) second gear synchro is shot.  get it fixed.  delay
and more grinding means you will further damage the slider/engagement
teeth, and that is lots more expensive to replace (in parts cost, anyway)
than just the synchro ring.  While your mechanic is in there he can look at
first.  3) in the mean time, double clutch every time you shift up or down
into second, and down into first while moving.  It's not hard, and you are
almost doing it anyway with the upshift delay you are using.  An upshift
double clutch maneuver will cost you a little bit of time, but the downshift
doubleclutching, because you do it while slowing down, won't matter. 
Just think of yourself in a long and now mostly historic line of racecar
drivers.

Double clutching up:  foot off gas and clutch depressed; shift to neutral;
clutch released and immediately depressed again; shift to higher gear;
clutch released and back on the gas.

double clutching down:  foot off gas and clutch depressed; shift to
neutral; clutch released and engine blipped with the throttle; clutch
depressed again; shift to lower gear; clutch released again; then do
whatever with the gas.

There is a sort of "stamp stamp" rhythm to this, it all has to be done
briskly, and some practice is needed to get the blips right. You are
matching speeds of rotating parts in the gearbox so they will slip
together.   It's good to know how to do generally.  If racing or in driver's
ed/autocross, when shifting down you combine this with heel and toe
braking/accelerator control.  This basically does away with the need for
synchros.  In fact, if you get it down really right, you can shift without
the clutch at all (above directions without the clutch parts), but that can
be pretty tricky, and I found it a lot harder than in my Vws of yore. 
Again, a useful technique if your clutch cable breaks in East Faraway at
an inconvenient time (and isn't that when cables always break?).  But fix
those synchros, as frankly you will not want to be doing this all the time
driving around town in traffic, Walter Mittyism to the contrary
notwithstanding.  That's why synchros were invented.
