Fans,

I've had the Platinum Bosch Plugs in my 87 coupe for about 28k kms.  I've
read that plugs should be changed at least every two years (their service
manual).  The car starts w/o any hesitation and there isn't any difference
in performance since the day they were installed.

Should I be changing them now? and is it necessary at this point?  The
plugs are supposed to be self-cleaning and able to run problem free for up
to double that mileage or more.

Also, the rotor and cap haven't been changed in the same interval.  Should
this be a consideration to?  I've seen allot of threads about the 02
sensor.  I have about 113k kms on the car (over 60k miles I think).  Should
the 02 sensor be replaced now or should I wait for symptoms to occur?  This
item wouldn't cause me to be stranded road side would it?

Joe
