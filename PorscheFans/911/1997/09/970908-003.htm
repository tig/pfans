 Eli --  I agree with you about ugly whale tails. But also know that if you 
are driving fast (over 100) the spoilers work well; I know as I have had cars 
both with and without. You must have both front and rear spoilers to work 
right. Driving hard without tail etc. car gets light and squirrelly in the 
front and you loose traction. Roof of car acts as an airfoil, creating lift, I 
hear. I like cars without tails much better visually, and I don't drive over 
100 much anymore (gettin' old...). 
Currently have nice original '81 SC sunroof coupe w\o tail with full leather 
interior, though have not considered selling yet, but who knows.... Have had 
her for many years, and she is an old friend. Warren C.
