Our local region generally doesn't allow V8 engined 914s and 911s to
drive at track events. This is not due to elitism. Rather it is a safety
consideration. Thinking you can put a V8 in a 911 or 914 to save money
is specious thinking at best. Doing it right requires an enormous amount
of chassis, suspension, brake, and driveline reinforcement and
modification. Otherwise the driver of the conversion will never be able
to safely control the amount of HP and torque that they have gained. The
idea of putting several hundred pounds more weight behind the rear axle
of a 911 coupled with the increase in torque makes me shudder thinking
about how evil this thing will handle.
