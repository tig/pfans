<< I have a 79 targa with chrome trim pieces around the windshield
and rear glass. I would prefer the flat black look, and I am
considering painting these pieces. Is this doable? I'd like to
paint the chrome headlight rings too.>>

I have a '78 Targa with the factory black trim.  About two years ago, the
paint on the front and back windshield trim started to peel off.  Most paint
shops told me that any repaint of the strips would not last more than a few
months specially on the front.  I ended up getting some standard 3M
electrical tape (It is the exact size to cover the metal strip around the
windshields, the bit that lays on top of the black rubber seal) and carefully
applying it on the trim. Surprisingly it goes on very smoothly, and you can
apply one strip all the way around. A year later, it doesn't show any signs
of coming off. By the way, I doubt that you could tell even from a few inches
away that it isn't original. The fit is that perfect. There is a clip in the
middle between the wipers that you will have to cover/paint and obviously the
wiper arms will have to be replaced with black ones. Your best bet for the
lights is to replace them with H4s with paintable bezels.
