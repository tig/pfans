I have an 1987 Carrera with the G50 transmission and as I was replacing =
the track wheels with the street wheels yesterday, I noticed that one of =
the CV boots was torn. Since I have received excellent information in =
that past (Thanks!), I thought I'd ask what is involved in replacing one =
of these. It can't have been ripped for too long, since I'd looked at it =
a week earlier, so I don't think it got too dirty.

It is the interior boot, closest to the transmission on the driver's =
side. I looked at the Haynes manual and it appears that you need to pull =
the CV off the axle (small circlip removal), then you can take the old =
boot off and put the new one on.

Question is: Do I need to pull the axle off the car? It seems that the =
axle nut is torqued to 250 ft/lbs, more that I can probably pull off =
with my tool set. Or can you just undo the 6 bolts that hold the axle to =
the transmission flange and work from there?


Thanks -=20
