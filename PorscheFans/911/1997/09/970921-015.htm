I believe the gentleman was speaking about an original Koni front strut. The
units, both as Porsche supplied originally and as Koni supplies now, have
hydraulic inserts which  Koni calls standard adjustable. Essentially you
must fully compress the unit in order to activate the internal adjustment
mechanism. Doing so should not have any affect on alignment. There are some
units (all 944 front struts) where removal will change alignment (camber).
For anyone interested in an externally adjustable gas insert for their
original Koni strut, we can now machine the externally adjustable insert to
fit the Koni strut.

The button type of adjustment is featured on 911 rear shocks for the 75-89
year models. It is present on both the standard red and sport yellow gas
units. The external (knob) type of adjustment is for the gas insert for an
original Boge front strut. Both the standard red and sport yellow inserts
feature this external adjustment. Although these units are intended for the
75-89 year models with Boge struts, they will fit any 69-89 Boge strut.
Valving specs for the later cars will differ because of the added weight of
these cars, so a standard red gas insert can be considered  sport valving
for the early cars.
