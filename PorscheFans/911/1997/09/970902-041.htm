Bob:

You may want to check your information... Even if the engine's just
idling at 1000 RPM, a connecting rod goes through a million 
cycles in less than 17 hours.

Titanium connecting rods last essentially forever... The ones in my
(non-Porsche) street car have experienced over 200 million cycles
and I expect them to be as good as new when the engine finally gives
out at about the two-billion-cycle mark.
