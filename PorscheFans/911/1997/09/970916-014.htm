     Thanks to all who responded to the problem I mentioned of the 1989 911 
     burning too much oil.
     
     Almost everyone who replied (at least 8 people) said that they had 
     heard of or experienced Carrera engines having valve problems.  Some 
     say it was the valve seal and some say valve stem.  Many people said 
     the problem occurs from as low as 45k miles to an upper range of 65k 
     miles.  The car has 69k miles.
     
     I have tried driving the car at high rpms (5k or so) and just letting 
     off the throttle to see if it smokes more on deceleration (closed 
     throttle, high rpm).  You'd think this would suck in more oil around 
     the valves.  I also did some downshifts which bring the revs way up in 
     the lower gear.  None of this caused any visible smoke.
     
     When warm, the car burns oil but it can't really be seen.  If, 
     however, I really mash on the throttle, it will put out just enough to 
     be seen out the rear view mirror in the headlights of the car behind.  
     The driver of the car behind could not see the smoke.
     
     As far as I know now, the engine will have to be removed and 
     disassembled to be sure what the problem is.  Even if the "valve 
     movement test" proves positive (valve stem problem) or negative (some 
     other problem), major work will have to be done.
     
     Thanks again for all the responses.
