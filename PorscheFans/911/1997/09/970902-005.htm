I have a black '85 Targa--the wheels are painted the body color. When I got
it, the wheels were extreemly dull and covered with hard to remove brake dust
and other crap. I took each wheel off seperately and worked on it-initially
cleaned the inside and outside with a brush and simple green and then worked
on both with Mothers paint cleaner. I had to rub and rub-but that stuff
finally came off-took me two days to do the four wheels (I'm retired). When I
was done, I used the other two steps of Mothers three step process--glaze and
then California Gold Carnuba wax-on both the paint and the rims. And, by the
way, I gave the same treatment to the inside of the wheels--that's where the
gunk comes from, Ya know. Now, when it's time to do the wheels, brake dust
isn't a factor--don't seem to stick to waxed wheels--and the inside cleans up
in about two minutes with simple green. Then I give it the three step process
and they are beautiful-the paint and rims shine! I do the wheels about every
six months now.
