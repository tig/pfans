Dan,      I also own an '81 SC, have had her for years. I find that my car 
runs just fine with or without the sensor plugged in! I know that sounds 
crazy, but I accidentally had it unlugged for about three months before I 
noticed it and put it back together. Pulled two spark plugs to see if mix had 
been off, and they looked ok, maybe slightly rich but not bad. Definitely no 
problems with rev limiting either way. Have you checked for the catalytic 
convertor being restricted maybe?
	Good luck with your car, please keep me posted as I am curious about what it 
is that you will find. Also, was the clutch job a big pain; I am going to need 
one soon I think. Thanks, Warren C.
