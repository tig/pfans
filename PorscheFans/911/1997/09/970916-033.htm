<<No matter how nice a car a Porsche is, it's still just a car, and doesn't
say a damn thing about the driver. And that was part of the thrust of my
original post.>>

I am going to have to ferverently disagree with this statement.  Although I
am young, I do have a degree in clinical psychology and take a little pride
in having a more than basic understanding  of people.  Like many of you, I
bought the cars that I have owned and presently own simply because I get
enjoyment out of driving and owning them.  I have never bought a car to
impress other people or to elevate myself to a higher plane in the
community/eyes of others.  However, I would say that the car you drive says
just as much about you as the clothes you wear and the food you pick out in a
grocery store.  For instance, if you took 5 people and gave them each $60K to
buy a car with, why would one pick a Dodge Viper, another an Acura NSX,
another a 911, another a Jaguar, and another a Mercedes?  Doesn't that say
something about each of them?  In my brokering business I deal with many
wealthy car afficianados as well as non-wealthy "poseurs."  One of the latter
is a doctor here in town that spends every cent he gets as soon as he gets it
- just to impress people.  Do you think he enjoys building a $1 million
dollar house and having to move out of it, or buying a brand new 1994 Ferrari
512TR and selling it after 6 months for a $30,000 loss?  He had to sell the
Ferrari to finish building the house he now is selling!  He also buys a new
$600,000 yacht every summer (via a loan) and then has to sell it in the fall
to have moeny to live on for the rest of the winter.  To me that says a lot
about him.  On the other hand there is another doctor I know that has over $8
million in immediately available cash who drives a 93 Corvette.  To me his
car also says something about him.  He could afford anything he wanted, but
chooses to invest his money rather than put on a show for all the citizens of
Evansville.  Maybe the gentleman who  blew off our fellow P-fan was the
poseur-type who had no idea what kind of car he had but bought it with his
last dime just to impress someone.  Or maybe he was just a millionaire jerk
who has never been impressed with something someone else had and wanted to
express his admiration.  I think his attitude and his choice of car both say
a lot about him.  Plus, why is everyone being so hard on the poor guy who
originally started this thread?  The guy at the track didn't have to stand
there and talk to him, but he could have at least been polite.  I hope I
never meet a few of you at a gas station in our respective 911's, because I
would compliment your car and and least have an exchange of words.  And I
would hate to get "I don't want to hear it because I didn't buy it to impress
you" as a response.  I'd just smile and say "too bad you couldn't step up to
the turbo."  Lighten up guys.  We own something that many people lust after
but few can afford.  Being a role model and being a down to earth friendly
person are two different things.
