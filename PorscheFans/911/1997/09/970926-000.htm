The best is using a front mount cooler with a 930S, RSR or IROC front end. We
customize Mazda tranny oil coolers and they work great (SoCal racing day @
108 deg F and 210 deg oil temp can't be beat) and fit right into the opening
beautifully. The cosmetic appeal of the front end is of course purely
personal. The later model Carrera fender cooler with thermostat controlled
fan work well but not as good at the race track on hot days. You can improve
the air flow by removing your running and turn signal lights. Although you
can also remove your headlight and get air through the bucket (cut out or
vented) this is an aerodynamic horror and takes some real balls to start
cutting Porsche metal like that. That is the limit of my personal experience.
