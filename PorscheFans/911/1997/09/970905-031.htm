Gotta disagree with this just a little bit.  Oil additives break down with
time
and temperature.  Even if you've got 20 qts, it's still all sitting at
200=B0+ and
degrading.  Granting that any fluid contaminants will be more widely=20
dispersed, and hoping that problematic solid contaminants are mostly in=20
the filter.
