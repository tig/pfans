Hi everyone,

I've got a couple of questions: (1971 911T)

1.  My transmission shifts "up" through the gears very well.  Going from
first to second is the only place that I encounter any problems.  Unless I
let the RPMS drop way down (IE hold the clutch in for several seconds) and
then make the shift, it grinds.  Also downshifting from 3rd to 2nd does the
same thing.  When I go from 2nd to 1st the car has to be almost at a stop.
Does this sound like Syncros?  It is a 901 Transmision in a 71 911T.  I'd
like to make my shifting smoother if at all possible.  Any
suggestions/ideas?  What would it cost me to get a 915 tranny and have it
installed?  What about a rebuild for a 901?

2.  What is a reasonable price for a Snell 95 Helmet?  I don't want the
chin protector or visor, just a basic helmet would be fine.  Any
suggestions as to where to buy one?

3.  Has anyone used the Mintex Brake Pads?  I looked at my brakes, and they
look like they are in fabulous shape, but I'd like more stopping power.
Would upgrading my brake fluid help stopping at all?  If I go to the Mintex
pads can I expect them to be better then factory pads?

4.  My mechanic wants $300 to do a full tune up on my engine.  This
includes valve adjustment, plugs, points, distributor, oil change, filters,
and carb adjustment.  Does this seem reasonable?  I could do the oil,
plugs, points, distributor myself I suppose, but I think that getting the
whole thing juiced up by a pro in the first place might make my life down
the road a lot easier.  Any thoughts on this?

Thanks for any help you can give me!
