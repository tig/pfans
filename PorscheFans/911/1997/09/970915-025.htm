Hello Pfans,

Need some advice regarding car covers as I'm thinking of purchasing one,
but am not sure if it's worth it.  I've got an '84 targa that I take out
mostly on the weekends for some spirited driving.  It's not in concourse
condition, but compared to many I've seen, it's above average.  When I'm
not driving it, I store it in the garage, and I think it would be a PITA to
put it on every time I park the car at work, the mall etc.  So, I would use
it while the car is parked in the garage, and when I occasionally leave the
car outside for extended periods of time to use the garage as a workplace
for remodeling the house.  I've been thinking of getting a grey flannel
cover for it's gentleness on the paint, but I don't think it would be good
outside against the elements.  So, now I'm thinking polycotton or Evo-4.
These all seem to run $150 and up from Perf. Prod, and Automotion.  Can one
buy the same thing from Wal-Mart or Pep Boys at 1/2 the price?  Any
satisfied car cover users out there?  TIA for the help.

Bob
