> Well I'd kind of agree with a few caveats.  Correcting or more

> threw exhaust on engines that have standing wave back pressure at
> lower RPM.  This won't effect total horse power but at least in my
> case greatly improved low end torque.  I'd agree that in most cases
> increasing the air intake with non restrictive filters without a
> correspondingly change to the fuel air mixture won't do much and even
> if you did both you would want to reconsider the cam timing if it
> where going to have much of an effect.  On plugs I have yet to see a
> plug change other than dual plugging that is intended to enhance the
> flame front that will directly effect performance.  Wish that wasn't
> the case as it sure would be nice to just bolt in some new plugs and
> get an extra 10 HP.  Just my $.02.
