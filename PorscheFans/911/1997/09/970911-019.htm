The extra neddies in the S are explained away by a more agressive engine
management tune taking advantage of the obvious changes to the intake.  

Having holes in the rear guards takes a little 'getting used to' but it
does have a purposeful stance and it's immediately distinguished from
run-of-the-mill, low-powered, ordinary Twin Turbos...

Nice story at that URL, thanks.

I didn't see the previous posting on the S, time to search the archives...

Cheers

Adam
