Anyone know of a shop that will mount and balance tires as well as
give my '88 911 a good 4-wheel alignment without scratching the rims,
etc.  Anywhere in the San Francisco Bay area, even South Bay.

Also, was there ever a resolution to the question "how do I tell if my
911 shock absorbers are worn out?"  My car has 94K on it and as far as
I know the shocks are original.  Seems to handle fine aside from a
very slight pull to the left, but I'm wondering if bad shocks are
making it seem like I need an alignment when what I really need is new
shocks.

Any thoughts appreciated,
