Hello,
   I would like to thank everyone who helped me solve my electrical problem 
last week. I received many suggestions from a lot of people. I would 
especially like to thank Carmen DeVito. He faxed me copies of TSB's that 
helped me greatly. I understand that he has a CD sold by AllData that contains 
every TSB for this model. I will definitely be buying one of those. 
   The problem turned out to be a control unit (relay) that was sticking. It 
was a control unit for the rear spoiler, located underneath the passenger's 
seat. I had a draw of 6.42 amps, while the specified maximum is 26 milliamps. 
The problem showed up the day after I bought the car, so it was really 
frustrating. Now that it is fixed I have been able to drive and enjoy the car. 

     Thanks for all of your help.
