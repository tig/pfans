i went with the brey-kraut for my bar in the 964... if you have ever seen
one you will know why they are priced as they are... they are as well
designed as the car itself.. it takes about 10 minutes to install and
remove, no scratches or miss allign probs... all in all, i'd rather have a
better bar holding me in my RS seats while i get bow-tied by some dork in a
nitrus corvette during a driver's ed event..

i went with saaaa belts as well... they are true art...

i retained my stock belts for daily use.... they do not interfere with the
harness system.. i got my goods from speedware and windward.

i'll never forget the time i had a first date get into my car and start to
eagerly strap the 4 points of the harness on.. she seemed dissapointed when
i recomended that she wear the existing belt.....
