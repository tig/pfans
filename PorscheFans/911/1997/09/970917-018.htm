     I asked Bruce Anderson about the potential for premature valve guide 
wear because of heat retention in 993's that use the under engine panels and 
received this response, which is reprinted with his permission:


Hi Gene,

I don't much care about the seal wear, but I am seeing the valve guides wear
out prematurely, like in less than ten thousand miles. When I commented to
Porsche about this they said they had another way to check the valve guide
wear and sent me a copy. Yes, their new way allows a lot of guide wear 
before
you can say that they are worn out, but I am still seeing about the same
results even using their method.

They say not to take the panel off that it will effect the aerodynamics of
the car. To which I ask then why don't they use the same panels on their 
race
cars... no answer.

I have not seen enough 993 engines apart to see if the problem will be as 
bad
with them, but I have never seen a 964 engine apart that did not have worn
out valve guides.

The real reason for the engine under panel is so that they can pass the 
noise
laws of Switzerland.

Take them off.

Bruce Anderson
