As much as I hate to do it, circumstances dictate that I must put my
beloved 1968 911 for sale.  I am the third owner of the car and have had it
for two years.  The second owner had the car since 1974.  The details on it
are as follows:

-  Originally sepia brown, I painted it Porsche White
-  Original black interior in OK condition.  I have a new headliner, but it
has not been installed.
-  The engine is the original 2.0 and has been rebuilt twice, most recently
about 20K ago.
-  The car is running on the original steel wheels, which are presentable,
but not great.
-  An extra set of 15X6 "Cookie Cutter" wheels and  new tires are
available.
-  There is minimal rust, although the second owner replaced the driver's
side floor pan with a patch panel.  I recently had the car on a lift and it
looks solid underneath.
-  It has a brand new 901 rebuilt transmission from Porsche Heaven.
-  Rebuilt front calipers.
-  It has new rear shocks.

The car runs like the wind and is very cammy.  I suspect that the past
owner had it "warmed up" a bit.  All of the trim is very presentable.  I
would rate the car as an excellent driver, but is not of show quality. The
car is in Evansville, IN.

  PRICE:  $7000
