Chris:

Glad you finally found a dealer that treated you like a 
real buyer.

Maybe the following will help others who are experiencing the
behavior that Chris describes; it's a message I posted to the NSX
list about a year ago:

    If you're 19 years old or otherwise look as though you can't
    afford to buy an $85,000 car, this can be an issue.  You can't
    really blame the dealer for it, either... The car IS expensive,
    his insurance premiums will go up if you damage it, and he
    doesn't have any information other than your appearance on which
    to base his judgement.

    A couple of things can help:

        1.  Don't waste his time if you REALLY can't afford the car.

        2.  Call first and make an appointment.

        3.  Dress appropriately.  Unless you wear one every day
            anyway, a suit is neither necessary nor particularly
            helpful... You want to exude an air of easy affluence, and
            wearing a suit that's been in your closet since your last
            job interview won't project that image.

            I'd suggest wearing a button-down shirt, no tie, a
            sportcoat, a pair of slacks, and loafers.  If your
            wardrobe doesn't include all that, you can ditch the
            slacks in favor of a clean, pressed pair of jeans.

            The jacket can go, too, but I'd REALLY recommend against
            substituting running shoes for the loafers... Aside from
            the fact that many salesmen are actually trained to judge
            people by the shoes they wear, owning a really good pair
            of Italian shoes will do wonders for your outlook on life.

            Ok... Enough unsolicited fashion advice.

        4.  Be well-informed when you arrive.  Detailed knowledge of 
            the car will demonstrate that you have more than a
            casual interest in buying it.

        5.  Stress that you're ready to buy the car; don't tell him,
            "Oh, I'm just looking around at cars I hope to be able to
            afford someday."
