My 83 SC Coupe refused to even turn over in the car wash after a recent
weekend breakfast trip.I pushed the car and got it started. We got it home
and in the garage It continued to refuse to turn over. The Haynes manual
suggested turning on the headlights. which i did. They went out completely
while turning her over.Suggesting a battery problem or a connection. I
pulled the battery cleaned the terminals tested it (OK) put it on the
charger anyway while I cleaned the cables. Put it all together and it still
wouldnt start. I got out my catalogs and priced ignition and starter gear
and when I woke up it was the next morning. where upon it started right up. 
I can only think of two things heat and water. It never registered any
excessive heat via the gauge it wasnt hot out mid 70's the driving was a bit
spirited but not excessively so. The car wash is brushless and I was very
careful to not apply undue water pressure anywhere.

your assistance would be appreciated.
