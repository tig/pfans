I wrote this for the Windblown Witness" the monthly publication of the
San Diego Region of PCA. I hope you don't mind be taking up a lot of
bandwidth.

Unfortunately, the photos (especially of the 996) don't show up well in
Text Only format. I have cut a few mninor comments that are SDPCA
specific.

FYI, if you can ever get a tour, do it! One word of warning. After a
factory tour, you will have a great urge to buy a new Porsche.

Porsche Factory Tour
by Bob Fagaly

My tour started out on a low note. My travel agent
booked me into the B=F6blingen Stuttgart Novotel. B=F6blingen is 20+ mile=
s
from Stuttgart the opposite direction from Stuttgart. So be sure that
you are close to Zuffenhausen (or at least Stuttgart) when making your
reservations.

Friday morning, after a $63, 100 mph taxi ride to the Porsche museum, I
arrived during a light rain shower. So much for the down side of my
trip. Two pieces of advice, first get a local hotel [FYI, two hotels
within walking distance are the other Novotel near Stuttgart (at
Korntaler Strasse 207, D-70439 Stammheim) and the Hotel Flora
(Sch=FCtzenb=FChlstra=DFe 16, D70435 Zuffenhausen)] and second, I found o=
ut
that if you try to take notes on the tour, you may miss a lot. The real
way to write about the tour is to go twice, one to write everything down
and the second time to enjoy the tour.

The factory tour is only available with advance reservations (thank you,
Dan Hopper of Porsche Cars North America). There were nine on the tour
which lasted one and one-half hours. Unfortunately, Porsche doesn't
allow photos to be taken within the factory. German law requires that
all workers that might be photograph must give their individual
permission for each photograph. If photos were taken, production would
come to a halt each time there was a tour. I did ask if there were any
stock photos of the production facilities, but was told that they are
only available to professional journalists. So no factory photos.

I met Ina Schlegl at reception center in the Museum and she introduced
our tour guide Marc Bongers who has been with Porsche three years. He
applied for the job after taking the factory tour himself. Marc started
with a short history of Porsche which all of you should know by heart.
Production at the Stuttgart site started in 1950. The day I visited,
Porsche would make 110 Boxsters and 48 911s.
=20
We started in the engine plant with Marc describing the major assemblies
of the 911 engine. Next to him were four sub-assemblies of the induction
manifold showing the=20
1) VarioRam induction paths,=20
2) short block with twin turbos that made it easy to understand exactly
how twin turbocharging works,
3) cylinder heads with valve assembly and
4) exhaust catalytic converter system

We were then told about Porsche's quality assurance/improvement program.
Marc was very proud of the number (more than eight/employee) of
improvements suggested each year by employees For major improvements, a
Porsche employee can get up 1/3 of the next years cost savings, in some
cases 10,000 DM or more.

We then walked down the 911 engine line. Carrera Cup engines are on this
same line mixed in with the normally asperated and turbo engines. The
engines are on a slow (1 foot/minute) line of engine stands. Each engine
had a flag showing what country it goes to so that the right emissions
package could be installed. Bar codes were attached to each engine so
that they could easily match the engine to the right car. An experienced
Porsche engine builder can make eight 911 engines in an eight hour
shift.

Next to the 911 line is the Boxster engine line. Here two assemblers
make eleven engines per shift. The cylinder walls of the Boxster engine
has a microrough finish to hold the lubricating oil better. This extends
engine life. The 911 cylinder liners are supplied by Mahle and those for
the Boxster by KS.

When the engines are finished, they are taken to the test room where
they are pressurized with prewarmed fluids (oil, air and water for the
Boxster). Injected engines are tested for 35 minutes and 55 for turbos.
When the testing is over, the Turbo rotors must be allowed to spin down
from the 100,000 rpm they reach at maximum boost. Proper treatment
(change oil regularly!) will let 120,000 miles go by (quickly) before
the turbo needs to be rebuilt. Reasons that an engine might not pass
this test is that it doesn't meet horsepower or torque guarantees or
that the engine just doesn't sound good to the engine tester. Less than
5% are sent back.

On average, each 911 engine was finished the day before it went into the
car. Boxster engines are completed only a few hours before installation.
Just as we were leaving the engine line, two robots meandered by, each
carrying an engine to the engine test room. It was kind of cute.

Next to the engine lines is the line where the transmissions are fitted
to the engines. Porsche designs and tests the transmissions. The manual
transmissions are assembled by GETRAG and the Tiptronics by ZF. Because
of the extra room in the Boxster chassis, the Boxster Tiptronic
transmission can be larger than the 911 Tiptronic. This allows the
Boxster Tiptronic to be new generation 5 speed. I'm told that the new
911 (the 996 - see photos) will get it starting the serial production
after the 1997 holidays.

Twenty years ago, Porsche designed and tested the brake system for what
some consider the most awesome road racing car ever built - the 917. The
success of these brakes was so overwhelming that Porsche decided to
introduce this system into future serial types. The brake calipers for
both the 911 and Boxster are casted and machined by Brembo, the Italian
company that makes brakes for Formula 1 cars. The stopping power of the
brakes on a 911 Turbo is the equivalent of 1941 BHP when braking at 175
miles/hr, The 120 to 0 time is 4 1/2 seconds! Stopping in only 427 feet,
the 1.15 g's average deceleration enough to launch you through the
windshield if your seat belt isn't fastened! One interesting option is
that you can have your brakes painted to match your car. I saw a US
bound Turbo with silver calipers instead of the standard red. By the
way, the yellow brake calipers on the Turbo S are the same brakes as the
Red ones, the only difference is cosmetic.

We were unable to go into the body shop, but you could see the cars in
a glass enclosed conveyor six stories above the four lane street that
divides the body and engine/final assembly buildings. Marc mentioned
that Porsche was the first manufacturer to galvanize the entire car body
(both sides, not just one). Not only are there obvious cosmetic
advantages, but Marc stressed that galvanizing retains the car's
structural integrity in the case of a crash-another reason to justify
your buying a Porsche. While going to a separate building where the
leather interiors are done, a 996 drove by. None of us were smart enough
to ask about it at the time. [however, take a look at the cover of this
month's "Windblown Witness"]

It takes approximately one week to make a standard 911 Coupe. If you
want a leather interior, it takes another 30 man-hours to dye, cut,
shape, glue and stitch the 30 square feet of leather. We were shown
maybe 50 different colors. Over 600 are available including the ability
to match virtually any color you bring them. To fold over the complex
curves found in a Porsche interior, Some sections of leather are as thin
as 0.024". Portions of the complex stitching is still done by hand. Only
cow leather is used. Porsche has found that other types of leather won't
hold up, so don't even ask for elephant leather (besides being terribly
politically incorrect).

Although not part of the tour, I was able to see the new car delivery
center. There were over 50 Porsches waiting for their new owners to get
them. Next to the delivery center is the exclusive workshop. This is
were custom appointments are installed. I saw one Boxster having its air
conditioning louvers being covered in green leather that matched the
interior.

Before delivery, every car is driven 15 - 30 miles on city streets,
country roads and the autobahn. Some 80 items are checked before it can
be given to its buyer. This has to be one of the fun jobs in the world.

After the tour, I went to the Porsche Museum. By most standards, the
museum is quite small, only some twenty cars, but what cars! Three 917s,
the Le Mans winning 962, the Moby Dick 935, a 959, the Panamerica design
study 911, a 1950 356, two Speedsters, a Carrera 2 and a 356 Cabriolet
Police car.

I able to eat lunch at the Porsche guest restaurant in the factory. The
menu was:
Maultaschensuppe
Gef=FClite Poulardenbrust
Florentiner Art mit tagliatelle und tomatensauce
Schokoladenmousse

After a very nice local Riesling, I caught the local train to the
Stuttgart returning to the real world. My tour of Porsche was something
every Porsche affectionado should do.
