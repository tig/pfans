OK, here's a twist on the oil level gauge vs. dipstick argument:

The consensus is that you should trust the DIPSTICK more than the oil level 
gauge in the dashboard.  How can it be, then, that my oil level gauge shows 
low oil and yet my dipstick shows full oil?  Here are some details:

When I took delivery of the car seven months ago, the oil level needle was 
horizontal (I assume the dealer filled the oil before delivery).  After the 
first few hundred miles, the needle gradually sank until it sat in the red 
zone at the bottom of the gauge.  These are readings taken after engine is 
warm and idling for at least 20 seconds.

Fine, I said, the engine is supposed to consume oil, so let's check the 
dipstick to make sure.  Engine is still idling, all warmed up, and the 
dipstick shows FULL!!!  (Oil is up at the top of the "twist" section after 
I wipe the stick and reinsert and pull out.)  This condition of low oil 
gauge and full dipstick happened for the first 2000 miles.

Then I get anxious, go out and buy six quarts of Mobil 1.  With engine 
warmed and idlling, I add oil while watching the gauge through the back 
window.  It took about a quart before the needle started to move, and moved 
it did to slightly higher than horizontal.  Then I check the dipstick and 
of course it shows full.

It's been another 2000 miles, and recently the oil level needle has started 
to sink lower in the gauge again.  Guess what the dipstick is STILL 
showing!  May be I have a bad oil gauge whose failure mode just happen to 
coincide with the behavior of an engine designed to consume oil.  Or may be 
my engine was one of the experimental ones that was designed to not consume 
oil :-).

So I'm a little stymied.  Have any of you seen this condition, and what 
should I do beside being stymied?

TIA,
Bob
