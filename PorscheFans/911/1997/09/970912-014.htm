Why ANYONE would want a pimpmobile like that is beyond me!
IMHO, that car represents everything that is bad about Porsche.
Talk about gold chain cars, that one is the ultimate. It's
all about show, and not about go. That is the antithesis
of my belief of what a Porsche should be. I thought their
slogan and purpose was performance performance performance,
function beyond form and all that stuff.

Then they go and release that silly, fluffed out version of
the totally awesome TT. Great, I just NEED a leather covered side
window switch, that will really help me get down the road faster.
And if my fingers don't touch leather when I open the window,
I don't want it. SILLY SILLY SILLY. What's next faux carbon
fiber interior pieces (a la BMW and Mercedes)?

A PORSCHE SHOULD BE REAL DRIVERS' CAR, NOT A POSEURMOBILE!
