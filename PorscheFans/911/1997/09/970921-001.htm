Hey fans in P-land,

        Please help a D.I.Y. (Do-it-yourselfer) like myself to solve this
problem.  This Saturday evening was a clear sunny day, so let's take out the
close to closet queen 1988 911 Targa (42,000mi) for a ride with the top off
(leaving it unfolded in the garage).  I drove about 2 minutes to my first
errand and it started up fine as usual (no gas, just a flick of the key). I
parked the babe for about a minute, and went to start it, and again it
started like a charm.  While backing out of a parking stall taking it easy,
an idiot quickly cuts in front of me, and my quick reaction to remove myself
from a possible accident! I popped the clutch revving at about 1500rpm and
my 911 fishtails (lovely feeling) and grips and away we go. About 2,000
yards slowing down to make a right exit turn out of the parking lot, the 911
starts to stumble and then dies dead stop (embarassing at best).  I waited
for traffic to disburse then I pushed the light 2850lb babe into a parking
stall.  Hoping maybe I over-gassed the 911 when it fish-tailed, I proceeded
to wait 10-15 minutes to let any unvapourized gas to dissipate before
attempting to re-start.  To no aveil it did not start, I then remove the air
cleaner housing and waited another 15min., putting back the air cleaner
housing and re-attempted to start it.  The 911 sorta wanted to start but
dies (cranking and turning the engine is no problem, but it just not
starting).  I proceeded to check the distributor cap and spark
plugs.....plenty of spark but not starting.

The question is what could be the problem:

1) Fuel pump? , if so how does one test for proper functioning?  If
electric, then    unhook outflow and turn ignition 'on' to test
flow....would that be correct?            
2) Fuel injectors? How to check?

3) Ignition problem?

4) Any other suggestions? 

Greatly appreciated if someone has any ideas on this problem?  Thanking the
P-list as always in advance in their great contribution to D.I.Y.!
