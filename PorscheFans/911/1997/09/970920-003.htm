Greetings,

After reading several posts on how to change the front bumper "smile" =
seal on SC's, I ordered the parts and began the process last night.  The =
front bumper strip came off easily with a "clip puller" I bought at pep =
Boys, and the 4 retaining nuts to the impact absorber were also no =
problem.  It took a few minutes at that point to get the bumper to start =
to slip off the 4 bolts but it did start to move.  Then Murphy came to =
visit.  Just as the bumper began to clear the bolts, the bumper hung on =
something.

By the sound it makes at this point, I think I must be missing something =
else that has to be removed be completely disengage the bumper.  Any and =
all ideas here are much appreciated.

TIA,
Hal Michael
'82 SC Rosewood
