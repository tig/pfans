Manny,

The fuel cap seal was the first thing that I thought might be causing
the problem since the leak was around that area. I changed the fuel cap,
dealer had it in stock, but that did not solve the problem I still have
a leak in the area. Thinking that the second fuel cap might be defective
I swapped it with my brothers,  he also conveniently owns a 911, good
taste does run in the family;).  Same leak is still there.

A few P-fans have recommended having the breather hose checked. I plan
on having that checked this week by my mechanic. I'll let you know the
results.
