My two cents worth on a variety of HOT topics:

SUV's:  They're great when towing Porsche race cars (my Ford Explorer being
one of them), taking the kids to the beach (ditto) or with skiis in the racks
(ditto again)...

Porsche Comraderie:  My theory is that as the air conditioning and stereos
improved in Porsches the waving and blinking reduce proportionately. The
cocoon affect serves to insulate the driver from the external experience of
noticing and caring about others (unless of course they cut you off or are a
very attractive member of the opposite gender).  The old 260 A/C system kept
you more aware of your surroundings (for you new folks that refers to two
windows open at 60 mph) and the song of a boxer motor was the preferred
music.

Spark Plugs:  I have always inspected my plugs and run them as long as they
continue to pass the visual test of showing no signs of degradation. What I
would like to know is if anyone has actually ever done a truly apples to
apples legitimate dyno testing to show any difference at all in engine
performance between the different makes of spark plugs. More spark, longer
spark, quicker spark, wider spark, narrower spark, blah, blah, blah... There
is so much spark plug snake oil being peddled these days - Split fire, Beru,
Bosch... Platinum vs. silver vs. copper vs. unobtainium.  I remember when
mufflers were the hot topic and we bolted some different ones on the back of
an SC for rear wheel power testing. The majority REDUCED rear wheel power vs.
the Porsche's stock muffler.  The best added only 3 hp @ peak.
