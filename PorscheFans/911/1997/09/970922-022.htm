contact is:

I would be interested in hearing from anyone with any experiences
with this school.

I just bought a 993 in June and attended my first TT a few weekends ago at
Thunder Hill.  Hurley Haywood was our guest instructor and took me for a 
spin in my car.  What fun!

These mods should be nearly 100% reversible.  A number of people make harness
bars that attach to the OEM seatbelt mounts, and at least Brey-Krause makes a 
fire bottle bar that attaches to the driver or passenger seat bolts.  I did
have to drill one hole for the inner lap harnesses for the driver side and
one for the passenger side.  Last weekend someone showed me the way he did
his inner lap belts attaching to the inner rear seat bolts.  So his
installation is 100% reversible.

You can also learn alot from autocrossing in the GGR, LPR and Zone 7 events.
And you are only required a helmet for those.  It would be wise to take a 
number of these in before attempting a TT anyway.  There will be one this
Saturday in Dublin.
