    Colin:

    I would DEFINITELY replace your shocks... Here's a copy of a
    message I posted back in December:

    Bob:

    After three or four years, your shocks will have traveled maybe
    30,000 to 80,000 miles.  It's reasonable to expect that ANY shocks
    (even Konis) will wear out after that much use.

    Yeah... It makes sense to replace shocks based on mileage even if
    there are no wildly-obvious symptoms (like oil all over the outer
    tube) of shock failure... As you imply, the degradation is so
    gradual that you often won't even notice that your car's handling
    has gone to hell until you put new shocks in and are amazed at the
    difference they make.

    A car with worn shock absorbers will:

    1) tend to hop and chatter over small bumps,
    2) possibly oscillate like a big old Plymouth after large bumps,
    3) feel soft and unresponsive overall, or
    4) feel as though it's continually shifting its weight from side
       to side or front to back without ever getting settled.
