I own a 1987 911 Carrera (non turbo).  I have several questions.  I
recently put on a new oil filter and notice that it takes a loooong time
for the oil guage on the left side of dash (the one with the red at
bottom and the white at top) to start moving.  Once it is really warm,
it moves up but occasionally, the needle drops all the way down to the
top of the red (under acceleration).  Is this the way it is supposed to
be?
Next, what is the largest wheel size that I can go to on my car.  I have
the original 15 inch wheels.  Can I go to 16 or 17 inch wheels without
the need for spacers or offsets?.  I do not want to do any body work
just to get the larger size wheels.  What is the largest size tire that
I can use with the 16 or 17 inch wheels?
Next, My headlights seem to be foggy.  Is there something which can be
done to clear them up?
Thanks in advance for any help!
