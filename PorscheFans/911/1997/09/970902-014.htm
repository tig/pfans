Actually, as I understand it, both have excellent high-end response
since both pressurize the intake charge.  The difference is that
the turbo runs off of exhaust gas and therefore needs higher rpm to
generate higher pressures.  The supercharger runs directly off the
crank via belt and gets pressure from zero to whaddaya want, so
it has no lag and just gets better as it revs.  The tradeoff is that
the belt drive does take away a little power, but hey, it's more than
replacing it, right?  Now that I think about it, the supercharger's
response is linear and proportional to crank speed so I guess you
could juggle the low vs high by playing with the pulley ratios?
Never driven a "supe" but that's my $0.02.

I saw one this past weekend at our region's Rennfest Festival.
Silver widebody with the full Knoxville treatment.  The supercharger
is a Paxton unit that fits neatly under the tail and looks *very*
butch sitting in there.  When he wound it up in the autox, the
whistle it made was reeeel cooool too.  The owner had just got it back
from the shop after a tree fell on it and literally drove it straight
to the festival.

BTW, this was my first autox and WOW! What a blast!  And believe it
or not, I finished third in class.  'Course there were only five cars
and one didn't run, but I was still pleased.  Only got it seriously
sideways once (somebody told me I wasn't trying hard enough :) but
I *still* made the gate!
