Hi Brian,
From one who lived and loved life in Endicott, New York and Rochester, 
Minnesota for many years before returning to my native state of Colorado 
where I can drive my baby year-round, here's what I followed for 
winterization.  The following is summarized from Porsche Technical Bulletin
0300/8802 dated March 25, 1988:

-- Clean vehicle thoroughly inside and out
-- Clean engine and engine compartment
-- Under carriage and chassis components should be free  of dirt and salt
deposits.
-- Fill fuel tank
-- Increase tire pressure to 58 psi.  Do not lift the vehicle due to
possibility of 
   corrosion of shock absorber pistons.
-- A/C should be in good condition and fully charged.
-- Change oil and filter
-- Seal air intake
-- Seal exhaust
-- Windshield/headlight washer solutions should have antifreeze as necessary.
-- Remove battery and charge at least every 3 mos.
-- Put silica-gel dessicants in a clean/dry interior  (Porsche recommended 3 
   bags of at least 500 grams each.)
-- Close windows, doors, and lids.
-- Open heating/ventilation flaps
-- Ensure brakes are completely dry (don't put into storage immediately 
   after washing)
-- Do not apply parking brake
-- Engage transmission in gear to move shift rod all the way into the 
   transmission to prevent shift rod corrosion.
-- Move the vehicle slightly every 4 weeks to prevent flat spots on the tires.
-- Do not operate engine until vehicle is placed back into service.
-- Protect from direct sunlight.

Additional items that I did that were not part of the Porsche bulletin:
-- Block windshield wipers off of windshield.
-- Park car on pieces of scrap plywood so tires were not in direct contact 
    with the concrete.  (don't know if this did anything but I did it anyway)

Items mentioned in the Porsche bulletin that I did not do:
-- If required, apply cosmoline to under carriage
-- If car is to be parked more than 3 months, squirt oil into the cylinders
(3-5 ml)
-- Spray cold engine with corrosion inhibitor

Returning vehicle to service:
-- Remove intake/exhaust covering
-- Check for nesting creatures
-- Install battery
-- Adjust tire pressures
-- Check a/c charge

CAUTION: Brakes may not have the highest efficiency after long storage.
