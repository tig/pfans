<..... they could be using a superior media to the Porsche OEM filter element
allowing as
good, or better, filtration efficiency ( judged in % retained of a given
particulate micron size) with lower pressure drop and more dirt holding
capacity.

There are all sorts of filtration media being invented every year. Some of
the biggest changes have been in the manufacturing process allowing smaller
diameter fibers to be uniformly processed with quite radical woven patterns.
The key is to have all the unwanted particulates in the air flow follow as
torturous a path as possible through the filter element to ensure that it
will be collected (impingement) in the media while also maximizing the open
area of the media to keep pressure drop as low as possible and dirt holding
capacity as high as practically possible......

<<There is a huge filtration industry out there that does nothing but create
new medias for higher filtration efficiency, longer life (for instance glass
and polyester felts are washable and don't break down like paper), increased
dirt holding capacity and all the while lower pressure drop. K&N marketing
seems to key on the lower pressure drop issure which will decrease the burden
on the engine's ability to suck in combustion air.  The engine is a positive
displacement device which will pull in as much air as required to fill the
cylinders. If you lower the restriction to the inlet you <allow ,the engine
to pull in the required amount of air with less effort. Also, the higher the
vacuum level the engine must generate to pull in combustion air the lower the
air density (lbs per cubic foot) becomes thus the lower total  mass  flow
(weight often measured in lbs/hr) of air. The lower the mass flow of air the
less power capability from the combustion process.

Whether or not K&N filter elements have a "measurable" difference is up to
the dyno results to prove but it is "theoretically" a good choice. >>

K&N advertises they use an oil-wetted "surgical cotton gauze." Now maybe
someone over at K&N thought, "Hey, let's try using this gauze stuff, wet it
with oil to catch some crud and make some air filters and see how that
works." Surgical gauze is made for, yep, that's right, dressing flesh wounds
and allowing air to help heal the applied area. That it also made for a
passeable air filtering medium is laudible, but folks, there are better
filtration materials out there. Sure, the gauze allows less pressure drop
across the filter (bigger holes = more air flow), but where are the smaller
dust particles going? In addition, what's the efficiency when dust particles
fill up the filter material ?

<<As far as airbox design goes... the air flow into the induction system must
have the proper flow pattern characteristics to optimize combustion.
Turbulence, pre-swirl or laminar flow can be the right or wrong way to go
depending on the design of the throttle valve, ports and combustion chamber.
Basically it's all got to be designed together and not piece independent.>>

From what I've learned, it doesn't matter how fancy your intake path is, as
soon as you put a restriction in the air path (air filter) you've thrown out
any potential gains in power and torque from preplanned turbulence,
pre-swirl, pressure waves or laminar flow to pack more air/fuel mixture into
the cylinders. I'd like to stress that the previous statement only applies to
the air upstream of the filter. Once pass the filter, however, air flow can
then be tailored for the desired torque and power characteristics via intake
manifold/port length, diameter, surface finish, temperature, etc. 

On another note, can the K&N's actually straighten out turbulent pre-filter
air (their "FilterCharger" claim)? Is this a function of filter material,
normal intake air flow or just a bunch of advertising hype?
