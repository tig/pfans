<bold>PorscheFans:


Has anyone gotten a new top for a 911?  Have you put a Bill Hirsch top on
a 911 or do you know someone who did? If you do,  how long has the top
been on the car?  One of the upholstery guys I called told me all kinds of
horror stories regarding tops and recommended a Robins top for  $1,475
plus $600 for labor.  He said that almost all the other ones are going to
be in  very bad shape in about two years.  He also said that the original
German material is actually not as good as the American Stay Fast
material.  Does anyone have information on that matter. 


I would like to talk to someone who got  a new top within the past couple
of years in order to find out what their experiences were.  


Thank you for your help.
