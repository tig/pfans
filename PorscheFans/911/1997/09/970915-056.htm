Hey Harley,

Thanks for the reply mail.  I think the 'kit' you are speaking
off is available through Automotion.  I had a shaft replaced
and put new needle bearings in as well.  This wasn't the
friction fit set-up, but you are right, maybe I shouldn't have
driven my buddy's car, his feels like a Camry clutch, where
mine feels like a 911.

Joe
