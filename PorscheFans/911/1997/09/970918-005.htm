P-Folk:

  Due to recent upgrade of my 993, I have loads of parts piling up in my garage. If anyone is interested in any of the following, drop me a note...

(*) Stock 3.6 pistons and cylinders, valves, springs, retainers, hydraulic lifters, etc. All from a low-mileage street-licensed car. Also have a new set of factory 964 cams, used a couple of days.

(*) 993 Motronics box, stock induction, ELP big bore Stage II throttle body, trick Bosch adjustable fuel-pressure regulator; stock synchros and sliders; stock R&P.

(*) Supercup aero sideskirts in black PVC--easy attachment to narrow-body car, gives you that wider Turbo-stance. Factory part from Porsche Motorsport, not after-market knockoff.

(*) Factory mufflers, complete. Also have two high-performance sport exhausts made by J.A. Fabiani: one steel model w. 3 1/2" chrome tips, one practically new stainless model (used four days) with 3 1/2" tips, removable silencer cores, plus heat wrap. Essential for stock-class track car, streetable.
