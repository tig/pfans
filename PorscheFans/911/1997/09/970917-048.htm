Walter:

I haven't done it on a 911, but I watched while a client of mine
indexed the plugs on a small-block Chevy to prove the effectiveness
of the procedure.

On THAT engine, it made a pretty substantial difference -- 350-or-so
horsepower versus 340-or-so -- but he admitted to me that most
engines don't see gains quite that large... According to him, it's
not the fact that the side electrode shields the bulk of the air-fuel
mixture from the flame-front AFTER ignition; it's that the electrode
shields the spark-gap from the supersonic turbulence above the
piston just BEFORE the spark.

This particular engine was running something like 13.5-to-1
compression with Brodix heads and Keith Black pistons; sparkplug
indexing doesn't help as much on lower-compression engines that
don't squish the mixture so hard.
