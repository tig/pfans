Gene,

Don't feel badly about not knowing how to go about an oil change on
the 993 car.  You're also correct in stating that the Workshop Manuals
don't offer the greatest assistance.  My experience is thus:

1.  Remove the engine tray (something that I did when I took delivery.
    A tip that I've heard/read from Bruce Anderson amongst others).

2.  Remove the red hose that you spoke of to get to the smaller filter.

3.  Look for a rather large bolt that is located on the side of the
    crankcase in the area of the smaller filter.  Remove bolt and drain
    a small amount of oil.

4.  To get to the main oil tank bolt and the larger oil filter, you
    must remove the passenger side black plastic panel that I no doubt
    am mistakenly calling the underneath 'sill panel'.  This panel
    is roughly 6" - 8" wide and spans the length of the car between
    the front and rear wheels. 

    My mechanic doesn't fully remove the panel, just removes enough
    screws to gain access to the rear half.  To do this, remove a few
    of the screws in the rear wheel well to expose the screws needed
    to remove the sill panel (some folks take off the rear passenger
    tire while others work around it).  Remove enough of the screws
    to gain access to the large oil filter which is mounted horizontally
    very close to the rear tire.  Find the huge bolt on the oil tank
    and get a large container ready - the oil just flies out of this
    area!

Since this really isn't a job that one wants to do at home while on
your back, I usually take the car to the dealership for this bit of
routine maintenance.  I buy OEM Porsche filters via mail order and
procure Mobil 1 in bulk when on sale.  This way all I pay for is their
labor (around $70).

Hope this helps somewhat.
