Thanks for your input and in answer I would say firstly to the question
of why not a 930, it basically comes down to dollars. In Australia a mid
1980's Carrera would cost approximately US$45K + kit of US$10K = US$55K
whereas a '86 930 would be approximately $US82K. As you can see there is
a substantial difference.

As to the Paxton kit, I am assured there has been a large increase in
reliability with the introduction of the SN93 Supercharger. The engine
on the vehicle is actually a ex-US model and therfor has the 9.5 to 1
compression. As you have indicated the Euro version has 10.5 to 1 and
would require the pistons to be modified.

There is also a recent article in 911&Porsche World (UK) with an English
Kit using the Paxton equipment

Thanks
