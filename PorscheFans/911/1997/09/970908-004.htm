Sal- thanks for the tip- I had 2 notices up- which one were you replying to 
about Vertex? I am also in PB county-- West Palm. 
We fix 911's a lot because they break a lot, and we keep them because we're 
crazy...I have been crazy (in love?) for 15 years now, with no signs of 
recovery yet! I used to drive Italian cars, and believe me the 911's are 
better (less bad?). People are spoiled by Hondas and such.. we used to expect 
trouble from machinery 20 years ago, like I now expect crashes from my PC... 
hopefully that will get better too eventually. But if  911's never broke, we 
couldn't have the fun of trading war stories on Porschefans, could we? I have 
a friend with a Jaguar who loves to discuss Lucas-itis. Warren C.

Hey Warren, try Vertex down in Miami. I dont have their number handy, but
they have the cheapest prices in town. I am from Palm Beach County and have
used them along with my friends. When I talk to people from other states they
use them as well. Hope things work out. If these cars are so good, why are we
always fixing them?  SAL
