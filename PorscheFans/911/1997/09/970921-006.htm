Phans:

I have an '85 Carrera; the other day the wife and I stopped at a dairy queen.
I used the electronic controls (on the lower left hand side of the driver's
seat) to slightly lower the back-for a comfortable relaxed position. When I
was done, I decided to return the seat to it's original position and nothing
happened. After quite a while of fiddling with it-to no avail-I had to return
home with the seat in that uncomfortable position (for driving). When I got
home I decided to fiddle with it. I took off the controls and removed the
inserted plastic doodad that has four hollow posts with springs in them--and
BEEBEEs sitting on them. Removed, located the contact point that controlled
the back of the seat movement, cleaned same and returned the seat back to the
desired position. This was not without much swearing and pain and
consternation--several fuses and a trip to Pep boys. The problem is getting
the plastic doodad back in place with the BEEBEEs sitting on the four hollow
posts. I've tried many times and failed-put back the doodad without the
beebees and , of course, the controls don't work without the tension created
by the presence of the beebees. THIS IS TORTURE! Does anyone have any tips or
helpful hints to resolve this delemma? Help would be most appreciated.
