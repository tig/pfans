Hi James:

I also have an 87 Carrera, and here are a couple of answers to your
questions:

>...the needle drops all the way down to the
>top of the red (under acceleration).  Is this the way 
>it is supposed to be?
The gauge is for the oil level in the tank - and is accurate with the
engine warm (about 180 degrees - just over 1st hash mark on the temp.
gauge), at idle and with the car on a flat surface.  Under acceleration,
braking or normal driving, the needle will fluctuate wildly.  Remember
though, gauges & senders sometimes malfunction - dipsticks don't, so check
your oil level with the dipstick rather than only relying on the gauge.

>Can I go to 16 or 17 inch wheels....

Yes, 16 inch wheels were a factory option (mine has them) and 17 inch are
quite common for those who upgrade or replace their wheels.  There are
quite a few shops who are able to guide you for your upgrade, and if your
interested, drop me a note and I'll forward a few names to you - depending
on your location.

>My headlights seem to be foggy.  

For some reason, the H5's do seem to fog up, but there is a pretty easy
fix.  Remove the headlight assembly (as if you were replacing the bulb) and
soak a terry cloth swath in ammonia/water mix or Windex. (Don't use a paper
towel - it'll leave lint inside the lens....)  Then, with a coat hanger or
other such instrument (the tools that have a claw at the end to retrieve
lost nuts/bolts is great for this) securely tape the soaked towel to the
hanger and swab out the inside of the lens.  I've heard that others simply
slosh windex/cleaning fluid around the inside with similar results, but I
haven't tried this way.

Hope this helps you out...
John
