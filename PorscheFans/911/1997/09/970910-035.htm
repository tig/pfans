Sometimes it*,s apparently the relay, but I*,ll go with the wiper switc=
h as
suggested by Chris Deel.  At least that was the problem with my car.

Here is my standard post to the problem:

With my 1979 911SC, my wipers would not park and the intermittent featu=
re
didn*,t work.  Turns out it was the wiper switch.

When you turn the wipers off, there is a reed switch that should make c=
ontact
to "tell" the wiper motor to park.  If this contact is not made, the mo=
tor
won*,t park and the intermittent feature thinks the wipers are on so it=
 won*,t
work.  In my case I could gently push the wiper switch upward beyond "o=
ff" and
get the contacts to touch.  The wipers suddenly parked in the right pla=
ce.

There is a little tab on a plastic cam inside the wiper switch that pus=
hes the
reeds together.  In my car that tab had worn.  I ended up gluing a tiny=
 piece
of plastic to the cam to take the place of the tab, and everything has =
worked
fine ever since.  You might also be able to carefully bend the reed swi=
tch
contacts and get them to touch that way.

To get to the switch, I only needed to take off the lower half of the s=
teering
column shroud.  Remove  the small screw from each side and it should co=
me off.
I can*,t remember if I could get at the cam without unbolting the switc=
h from
the column or not.  Just move the switch from position to position and =
you
should be able to see how it works well enough to fix it.

Hope this helps!
