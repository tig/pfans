Regular and PROPER valve adjustments are VERY important on air (oil) cooled 
engines.  

I believe your "couple of mechanics" gave you bad advice.  I doubt they were 
Porsche mechanics or else some part of the story is missing...like they were 
just done 10k miles ago.  For normal driving, I'd follow the service interval on valve 
adjustments (15k-20k mi).  The valves can/do actually get tighter on 911s which 
might make them less noisy.  Wear can occur in different places.  One place like 
the rocker-arm-to-valve and rocker-arm-to-cam makes the valves loose and more 
noisy.  My mechanic said a second very common wear area is the valve pounding 
out the valve seat which makes less valve to train clearance and less noise.  With 
the second kind of wear, the valve does not close tightly and you are prone to 
getting a burned valve.  He recommends the valves be to spec but it is best to be 
on the loose side if they are not to spec.  There are several other important things 
regarding valve adjustments (engine temp, check them twice, compression 
check...).  Find a good mechanic or do thorough research if you are inclined to do 
it yourself..
