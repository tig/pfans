Vic, I would think you might have a case of the pistons maybe hanging up 
in the calipers due to dirt or wear.  Check the rubber piston gaskets; are
these
bad? (I believe your car has them; my '76 did).  You can try "exercising"
the pistons to see if that frees them up; put in the worn pads, pump brake
pedal till pistons fully extend and actuate the brake, pull pads out , push
back
pistons with a pry bar, reinstall old pads, then redo exercise.  Doing this
two or three times should free up the pistons.

Can also drive the car moderately on the street, usnig the brakes as little 
as possible, then stop and feel each wheel center.  If the brakes are
dragging
in the LR, this wheel should feel noticeably warmer than the others.

I just pulled the brake pads on my '78 911SC.  All of them are
at 50% except the drivers rear that's shot.  Does this sound like
a brake system problem or possibly just a bad pair of pads?

FWIW, the pads are Porterfield R4s, the car is almost exclusively
track driven and the first set this summer wore evenly (although
a bit quickly w/2 drivers at Blackhawk).

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
