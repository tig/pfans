Thanks to all who responded to my prior query regarding "no-start" and then
"rough start" and now "less than perfect running" conditions.  The consensus
was bad gas.  I have changed the fuel filter, put injector cleaner in, and
refilled twice since this incident. Car is MUCH better now, but it still
isn't quite right.  I have no idea if any of this even did any good.  New
fuel filter definitely did nothing.

A couple more descriptions of the problem, in hopes that I can avoid a trip
to the shop (I am now so consumed by this that I am committed to figuring it
out myself even if I burn up every weekend before the snow flys).  Car now
starts immediately, but sounds "off" slightly at idle.  Will accelerate up to
3K RPM pretty well, then it kind of misses or something upon accelaration
between 3 and 4K.  Actually feels like the wheels are out of balance
slightly, but it only does it while accelerating.  If I let off the gas and
cruise at 3,500 RPM, it is smooth.  I assume it is not firing on all
cylinders upon this acceleration?  Also, the engine has a real tendency to
bog down between shifts.  It will run nice up to 3K RPMs or so, and when I
shift to 2nd, it really has a tough time picking back up.  Does all of this
still sound like a fuel problem?  It definitely seems starved for fuel to me,
but the high-RPM acceleration wobble has me wondering.  Appreciate any other
ideas anyone has.
