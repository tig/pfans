Thanks to all who replied.  

Firstly  I live in Ireland where leaded fuel is still available at every
gas station.

Secondly I jacked up the car and I don't have a cat, which gives me an
extra 16bhp over a 911 fitted with a cat.

Now I actually managed to trace the PO over the weekend and for the last 2
years used leaded petrol.  I would like to move to unleaded, but only if it
is ok.  I know that the engine can run on unleaded but is the any danger of
switching to it after a long period of using leaded.

A for John Ahearn.  Thanks for the reply, but I happy to stick with my
current setup.  And I have no idea how much the used value of a Cat with
about ~ 10k miles is.

Thanks,

Larry
