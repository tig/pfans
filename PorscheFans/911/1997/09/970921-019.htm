<<They have a picture on them that looks like defrost.  What do these do?
 (It's an 86 911 Carrera Targa).  Also there is a round control behind those
(up on a flat black box mounted between the front seats that can be adjusted
from 0 to 3, and 3 also has a picture that looks like defrost (windshield
outline with "wavy" lines in it).  What does this do?  The manual says it's
the temperature control box or something similar.  And since winter will be
approaching, how do you turn on the heater in this car?  :)>>

Andy,
The lever and round knob you described are the heater in your car.  Whatever
you do DO NOT pull up on the red defrost lever.  It is part of a climate
control system that is controlled by the round dial behind it, and it moves
up and down automatically.  If you pull up on it you will break the little
plastic arm that moves the lever.  Although it is a $1.99 part you have to
remove one of the seats to reach the access panel to replace it.  I just had
to do this in my 930.  If your red lever does not move when you turn the dial
to the red numbers (after your car is warm) then replace your "arm".  Your
911 will blow hotter than you can stand after that (at least my 930 does).
 The little plastic piece on your headliner in between the sun visors is the
interior temp sensor.  There are also two sensors in the heat exchangers that
the "computer" in the car uses to try to keep a constant temp in the
interior.  The red lever on the dash controls how the heat is dispersed
(floor, vents, defrost).  If I didn't explain this well feel free to E-mail
me back for a clarification.
