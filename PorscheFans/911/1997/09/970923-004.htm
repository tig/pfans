>What is the procedure for a front wheel bearing inspection, adjustment 
>and/or replacement?
  
1. Remove wheel/tire.
2. Remove brake pads from the caliper.  You do this because you
can't get a proper wheel bearing adjustment with the pads right
up against the rotor.  This is a common mistake that is made.
3. Hold the upper part of the brake rotor and pull/shake firmly
away from and toward your body.  This will give you an idea of
how loose the bearings are.  The rotor should turn freely
but with no play when you check the bearings.  
Also, turn the rotor and listen for
any clicking, grinding, or other noises which would indicate bad
bearings.  With the brake pads removed, there should be no noise
at all when you rotate the hub.    
4. Carefully remove center "hubcap" which covers wheel bearing.  
The best way to do this is to grasp it with a large channel-lock
type pliers and gradually wiggle it until it comes off.
5. Loosen the small allen screw that tightens the bearing adjusting 
nut.  To do this, you must turn the hub until the little cutout
in the hub matches up with the allen screw.
6.  Tighten the adjusting nut right down by hand until hand tight.
Then back off about 1/16 of a turn.  Check the play and free rotation
of the hub and continue this procedure until satisfied that the
bearings are tight but not binding.  A tiny amount of free play is
OK for street cars; track cars need to have perfect wheel bearing
adjustment.
7.  When satisfied with the adjustment, retighten the allen screw,
replace the hubcap and brake pads, and that's it!
 
Hope this is what you were looking for.
