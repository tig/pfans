I have seen some bad mouthing of K&N Air filters, and had to respond.
K&N is measurably superior to any foam air filter you can buy. You can
have it both ways! They out flow anything, including factory and foam
filters. Anyone who says they aren't as good because they flow better
should take a course in electrostatics, or at least go down to their
basement and examine the electrostatic filters they have in their
furnace (if they are so lucky). Ask your furnace shop if electrostatic
filters are better.  I have used them for years in every vehicle I own,
including my 911 - and have seen many tests done on them. I used them on
my motorcycles and on a Baja Buggy that ran in the desert. They are
clearly superior. What is a bit more cost when they last virtually
forever. Of course, you will have to buy a can of the K&N filter oil and
clean the filter once in a while, but they come oiled ready to go and
you will notice a difference.
