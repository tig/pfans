Hi Mike,
I just completed a similar research project for my '86 911 Coupe.
Same reqmts as you have and same recommendations from
TireRack.  (At least they're consistent.)  I was also steered away
from the Firestones by the local folks.  I was seriously interested
in the Dunlop SP8000 but they were a bit more than I wanted to
spend.

If you haven't already, check out TireRack's web site.  
        http://www.tirerack.com/
The web approach gives you some more info about each 
tire and gives you the flexibility to poke around at different 
options that you might not have considered.  That said, I 
decided to price shop at the local stores and to gather 
more info.  I found that by the time you add in shipping, 
mounting, and balancing, the TireRack prices are not much
better than the local shops.  I also uncovered an option that
I hadn't even considered.

I'm seriously looking at the Toyo FZ4.  I'd never heard of 
Toyo tires before but am told that they're the #2 company
in Japan and have been in the US for 10 years.  I'm leary 
of a noname tire but for $125 mounted and balanced, I 
think I'll give 'em a try.  I just hope they're still around when
I need to buy another set of rear tires.  There's always a 
risk, I guess.
