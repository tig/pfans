Have read some interesting postings on this subject and would like to add
comment:

I don't know what K&N's media is exactly but it is quite possible that they
could be using a superior media to the Porsche OEM filter element allowing as
good, or better, filtration efficiency ( judged in % retained of a given
particulate micron size) with lower pressure drop and more dirt holding
capacity.

There are all sorts of filtration media being invented every year. Some of
the biggest changes have been in the manufacturing process allowing smaller
diameter fibers to be uniformly processed with quite radical woven patterns.
The key is to have all the unwanted particulates in the air flow follow as
torturous a path as possible through the filter element to ensure that it
will be collected (impingement) in the media while also maximizing the open
area of the media to keep pressure drop as low as possible and dirt holding
capacity as high as practically possible.

There is a huge filtration industry out there that does nothing but create
new medias for higher filtration efficiency, longer life (for instance glass
and polyester felts are washable and don't break down like paper), increased
dirt holding capacity and all the while lower pressure drop. K&N marketing
seems to key on the lower pressure drop issure which will decrease the burden
on the engine's ability to suck in combustion air.  The engine is a positive
displacement device which will pull in as much air as required to fill the
cylinders. If you lower the restriction to the inlet you allow the engine to
pull in the required amount of air with less effort. Also, the higher the
vacuum level the engine must generate to pull in combustion air the lower the
air density (lbs per cubic foot) becomes thus the lower total  mass  flow
(weight often measured in lbs/hr) of air. The lower the mass flow of air the
less power capability from the combustion process.

Whether or not K&N filter elements have a "measurable" difference is up to
the dyno results to prove but it is "theoretically" a good choice. 

As far as airbox design goes... the air flow into the induction system must
have the proper flow pattern characteristics to optimize combustion.
Turbulence, pre-swirl or laminar flow can be the right or wrong way to go
depending on the design of the throttle valve, ports and combustion chamber.
Basically it's all got to be designed together and not piece independent.
