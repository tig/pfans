Hey all...after owning my first 911 for roughly 3 months now I have been able
to figure out (from the manual) what 99% of the various knobs and levers do. 
But there are 3 I haven't figured out.  On the left and right side of the
parking brake lever there are red levers, which you push down to turn off and
pull up to turn on.  They have a picture on them that looks like defrost.  What
do these do?  (It's an 86 911 Carrera Targa).  Also there is a round control
behind those (up on a flat black box mounted between the front seats that can
be adjusted from 0 to 3, and 3 also has a picture that looks like defrost
(windshield outline with "wavy" lines in it).  What does this do?  The manual
says it's the temperature control box or something similar.  And since winter
will be approaching, how do you turn on the heater in this car?  :)

Thanks in advance!
