Hi Ron , What were you thinking?....A Ferrari 308!! The last time I saw an
old P-car attempt that it got so afraid it blew up its motor. Seriously
though the aggrevation this will cause you will far exceed the $900.00 .
Consider it a lesson in life.He charged you for his labour which may or may
not have been within the average time. Sometimes I find that a little extra
time in dissassembling will save time in assembling . It would be easy
enough to use an air wrench and strip half the bolts and then make you pay
later for all the retapping and broken stud removals. I think his time may
have been on the outside but on Porsche engines they usually don't all
respond the same way ...as if they are all new with no siezed nuts. One of
the things you are probably about to find is switching mechanics half way
can sometimes be worse than staying with the first one. Make sure you check
out wherever you go with references first. Good Luck and may the Porsche
gods be with you!
Dave and Chrissy

> started to question what he was doing...he told me he was the one to
> bring Porsche to Canada back in the 50's and he knew what he was doing.
> I though to myself  the way to check for bent valves is to do a

> and compression test should have been done before removing the motor.  I
> called the next day and was told I needed 6 exhaust valves 4 intake
> valves 3 rocker arms and new gaskets due to the leaks.  He told me the
> cost would be approx $5400.00 canadian to fix the motor.  I told him to

> a replacement motor and found one for $3500.00 they told me that they
> would install it for $250.00 I called Hiemrath back and asked what my

>   If I pay him then I would have to sue him and may not get my money
