See my eaalier message below.  Thanks to all that responded. Sam Shalala
of ProTechnic loaned me a good CD box, and that proved my CD box bad.
Turns out you can blow it if your connector at the coil comes off!  Now
I need to decide if I should buy a used Bosche for $125, a Permatune for
$240 or an MSD unit for $165.  Anybody got some experience or
recommendation?  BTW, Performance Products advertizes a new Bosche CDS
box for $1000. !!!

>>Need a little technical help. The other day I replaced the high tension lead from the coil to distributor on my 70 911T. Why I did that is another story and now I wish I hadn't touched it. Anyway, I cranked the 
engine but it wouldn't start.  I found the lead from the CDS to the #15
terminal of the coil had broken off. I reconnected it, but still no go.
I've checked the coil ohm readings and they all are in limits.  The CDS
still whines, but still no spark out of the coil.  Nothing else was
touch!  Any ideas?  Any other way to verify the CDS is functioning
properly?  Would having the lead from the CDS to coil open while the
engine was cranked actually cause it to go bad?  The cost of the CDS
units seem absorbantly high! Are these units repairable? Any help or
suggestions would be appreciated.>>>
