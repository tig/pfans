My 1979 Targa does this as well.  In 1980, Porsche updated the window =
lift mechanism.  My right side is the old style, but my driver's side =
has been updated to the newer design.  Both windows stick up some when =
all the way down.

As Harley mentioned, Targas and coupes have different window lift =
mechanisms.  I haven't been inside my doors for a while, but I'm pretty =
sure that the travel in the full down position is limited by an =
immovable stop.  The only adjustments the manual lists are for top =
travel (to ensure a snug fit against the Targa top seals), and also the =
angle of the window, so the front and the rear of the window can be =
adjusted to be parallel to the seal.

It does look like the 3.2 Carrera doesn't do this (based on photos in =
some of my books), but my manuals only go up through 1983.  Maybe =
someone with the Carrera manuals can explain the difference.

Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
