  I removed my air pump this morning to see if I needed a new rotor and
distributor cap, as I intend to do my first routine maintenance 15000 mile
kind of stuff. Since I will have to remove it again when all my parts arrive,
can I just leave it off? I will have to run the car to get the oil hot enough
to drain, but that's about it. Do I need to plug the small rubber hose that
exits the pump? When I reinstall it, what is the recommended deflection?
  As an aside, when it was off I noticed a wiring harness that consisted of
two female leads, one on a yellow (I think, it's dirty) wire and the other on
a brown and black striped wire, laying underneath everything. I have two male
leads, one yellow and one brown and black stripe (albeit wider stripe) also
pushed out of the way but unconnected. Could this be wiring for the
non-existent rear fog light?
  Thanks..
