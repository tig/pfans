     [Warning: longish post about an experienced driver taking a 911 to the 
     track for the first time.]
     
     I've driven many cars at driving schools but this was the first time 
     for me to drive a 911 the entire event.  The car is a 1989 Carrera 
     (stock).
     
     For one, I liked the power.  The car seemed to pull hard, especially 
     at high rpms, and reached pretty good top speeds on the front 
     straight.  I could easily red-line in 4th.  The speedo showed near 130 
     (I wish!) but the Owner's Manual says 6200 in 4th is more like 118 or 
     so.  The speedo is far off at high speeds.  I could get into 5th for a 
     few seconds but am not sure if that increased my speed much or not.
     
     The car is supposed to have upgraded brake pads and fluid.  I'm not 
     sure which type.  The brake pedal remained firm the entire weekend 
     which is very nice.  However, braking hard was uncomfortable.  The car 
     has street tires on it which may have contributed to this.  But, when 
     braking hard, I couldn't feel the car tip much nor could I feel the 
     car get a firm grip on the road.  It was as if when braking the car 
     had less grip than other times.  Strange.
     
     During turns, slight changes in throttle positions had interesting 
     effects.  Early in the weekend, the car seemed to have more oversteer 
     than later on.  A little lift of the throttle would really help rotate 
     the car.  This really is a nice feature because you can quickly and 
     easly make a corner you would have missed by a simple hint of using 
     less throttle.
     
     Also in turning, the stock Carrera doesn't have enough power to cause 
     power on oversteer which made it pretty easy to get fast corner exit 
     speeds.  Just turn in, apply some throttle, check poition, and squeeze 
     on to full throttle.  Simple.
     
     Shifting, though, gets low marks.  Finding 2nd in a 3-2 downshift is 
     rediculuous.  You should be able to find neutral, pull the lever 
     towards you all the way, then pull back... boom, 2nd gear.  Not so on 
     the G50 transmission.  If you pull over towards you too much, you 
     can't then go straight back to 2nd.  That caused several delays in 
     finding the gear for both me and my girlfriend.  This is something 
     that could be much easier.  The same goes for 3rd.  Often hard to find 
     for a new 911 driver.
     
     The pedals are also funny to operate.  And, that brings me to another 
     situation.  One of the club members (and list member) allowed me to 
     drive his 911 race car.  It has a 1970s 911 (gutted) with a 3.2 
     engine, a 915 tranny and is much reduced in weight. It has R1 race 
     tires, race pads, etc.  Driving it was like driving a go-kart 
     disquised as a Volkswagon.  Man, it handled great.  It did not feel 
     understeer/oversteer sensitive and just gripped like a race car 
     should.  It was easy to go 7 seconds a lap faster in this car without 
     even making the tires squeal.  Neato.
     
     In braking, though, the car felt twitchy.  When I used the brakes, the 
     car felt uneasy and like there were sidways forces on the car.  This 
     was probably due to me using the brakes while still turning.  "My" 911 
     was not nearly so sensitive.  Maybe race tires, race suspension or 
     some combination of modifications made the faster car more sensitive 
     to braking and turning at the same time.
     
     On lap 3, while still not having found the limits of grip in the 
     turns, I found the limits of braking and turning at the same time.  
     The rear end came around awful quick as I applied the brakes.  Not 
     exactly what I wanted to do in my friend's car who was lending me his 
     nice car.  Sorry.
     
     My original point is that when I went for both feet in, it was hard to 
     get my left foot on the pedal.  I ended up with my foot on the arm of 
     the clutch pedal and my toe only on the clutch pedal area.  I had to 
     just hold my foot in like that as I went on around.  I guess I 
     expected the pedal to move a different way or something.  At least I 
     got the clutch in.
     
     I think once I figure out that the twitchyness under braking is due 
     just to the nut behind the wheel, then I'll like 911s even more.  I'll 
     still have to work on and deal with the transmission, though.
     
     
     On the way back, my girlfriend and I discussed 911s versus NSX or 
     other cars that we had driven.  She liked driving a 911 better because 
     it had more character.  911s make you think 911 at all times.  From 
     the steering wheel to shift linkage to pedals to rear end coming 
     around... all scream "Porsche" to you at all times.  It is as if you 
     have to work to be good in the car but, when you do it right, it is 
     rewarding.  She liked driving a 911 more than an NSX even though my 
     NSX is about 10 seconds a lap faster (NSX has race tires).  She liked 
     the 911 regardless of how fast she went.  I understand her opinions 
     and feel the same way, to some extent.
     
     I look forward to driving the car on the track again but with better 
     tires.
