I went through this a few months ago. I had several options, all of which
seemed to cost about the same

 The seat covers were
about $700 from World Upholstery (http://www2.worlduph.com/worlduph/Default.HT
ML) and the installation was about $200. Incidentally, I did try to install
the covers myself, but it would have taken me a lot longer to do and I doubt
that the results would have been as professional looking.  I am told that the
covers from Autos International (http://www.autosintl.com/) are better, but I
am quite satisfied with the covers from World Upholstery . Good luck

'78 911 SC

I just had a leather seat cover for my 80 SC Targa installed yesterday.  I got
the seat cushion cover from Autos International, the perferations are a little
smaller than the original ones, but maybe that is what happens after 17 years.
 The installer, TrimLine in Redondo Beach said that the part was very well
made and cut perfectly.  I also looked at both Autos International and World
Upolstry (both advertise in Excellence)  I went with Autos International due
to better price: $200 vs $275 for the same part.
FWIW
