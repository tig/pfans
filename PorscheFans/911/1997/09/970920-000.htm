Hi guys, I'm just about to start my 2.7 engine rebuild but I have struck a
problem. There are oil jets behind each piston to cool them. While cleaning
out all the oil galleries, I noticed that 4 of the jets are fine and 2 are
blocked. They have a small valve behind the jet that opens at about 40 to
50 psi and this is where I believe the problem lies. I checked my manual
and it says these jets are factory installed and not removable.
	Does anyone know if these jets are available? The Porsche manual says
these jets reduce piston temperature by about 50 degrees Celsius and the
conrod bearings were blue on these two cylinders. Anyone struck this
problem before? I have cleaned behind the jets and the nozzles with wire
and I don't think dirt is the problem, but rather the valve not opening
correctly.
	Any help appreciated, thanks Dean.
