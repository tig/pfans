I have the original (according to PO) catalytic convertor for my '81 SC in a 
box in my garage. PO said it was working fine when he removed it and put a 
"test  pipe" in its place. It appears to be in good shape, but I am baffled as 
one can see straight through the device, from end to end... ???  I thought 
that it would probably have a matrix of some sort of ceramic or such stuff 
which would obviously block view? I was told that this is normal for these 
convertors... is this true, or has my convertor been gutted?
