Hi All,
   It is not my intention to sell parts on this forum but 
several issues have meen raised.
   FIRST, Jeff is correct.  Using our (Brey-Krause) or other's 
stuff, one can mount a harness and fire bottle in a car wothout 
drilling holes.
   The factory seat belt mounting points-including the one on 
the tunnel side of new cars-are severly tested/specified/and 
certified to DOT and TUV standards.  These points are certified 
to withstand a sudden 3000lbs pull.  If you think you are going 
to be worrying about what happens after you body experiences 
such a force, talk to your doctor.
   True, no COMPETITION sanctioning body will allow anything but 
a solid chassis mount. Righty so considering all the modifications 
usually associated with racing cars.  But for Driver's Ed 
events where we are all supposed to be driving well within our 
and the car's limits, you can make your own decision.
   If you ask me, I will tell you that we all should have FULL 
roll cages.  However, I am like Jeanne and Bob and do not want 
to drill holes in an otherwise perfect car.  Others including 
some of my best friends think differently.
   SECOND, Dan you are nuts for mounting you sub strap to our 
fire extenguisher mount.  It is not designed for the load and 
will fail you at the worst possible moment.  Our pieces are 
extremely carefully engineered for their intended purpose 
but that is it.  Please do something different before your 
estate sues me.
   THIRD, I did not and would never critize Golden Gate"s 
programs.  They sound well run and enjoyable.  I do advocate 
standard non competitive non intimidating Driver's Ed programs 
which make it easy for the newcomer to participate and learn.

Good Luck,
Dodge
