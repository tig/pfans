The CAR review is by Georg Kacher. It's pretty lengthy but the gist of the
article is that the new 996 is really superb - sort of the best
characteristics of the "old" 911-993 series and a 928 (huh?) rolled into
one.
It's much more refined and "civil" than the 911 - it appears Porsche's
target
demographic for the 996 was grey-haired guys over 57 whose daily
driver is a
Lexus. I passed the article on to my dad (61yrs, black E400 - close
enough).

Terence:

I'm wondering if the description of the target demographic is yours, or the
author's.  Frankly, I've heard all this complaining about the new 996, and
from everything I can tell, it sounds like a better car than the 993, and any
predecessor 911, in just about every way - more horsepower, better
cooling, better handling, more room, lighter, all for the same price.  And
I'm not in the target demographic - I'm 39, with a strong background in
racing Porsches (I just had my semi-annual driver training event out at
Willow Springs yesterday!).  I don't know about everyone else, but I'm
about to put in my order for European delivery on a 996 Cabriolet when
they come out.
