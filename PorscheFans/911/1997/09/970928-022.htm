Hello Porsche fans-

I just participated in my first track event in the 911, earlier this week.
One of the many things I would like to upgrade or improve, (better seat, 6
point harnes, new sway bars, stiffer torsion bars, and the list goes on) is
the steering. I would really like to quicken the ratio, but as I understand
it the 911 Turbo rack is no different, (ratio wise), so I assumed there was
no real easy way to upgrade. Then this eve I was leafing through an
excelence magazne from earlier this year and spotted an add placed by
VISION Motorsports, (anybody have any experience with these guys?). They
advertise a "Kokeln Short rack and Pinion" which quickens the ratio by
about 20%. Has anybody tried one of these. Are there any opinoins good or
bad about Kokelm products? How hard would it be to replace the rack and
pinion? I would assume the steering rack itself would come out, but that
SEEMED pretty accesable?

Any and all thoughts and opinions are welcome.

Thanks for your time
Michael Russell
