     Am I the only one who can't remember exactly where he/she read this 
     rumor?  Within the last 3 months, under a spy photo of the new water 
     cooled 911, the caption read that Porsche was toying with a new water 
     cooled non-928 32-Valve V-8 for a not-to-distant future 911.  I 
     receive AutoWeek, Panorama, Excellence, and European Car but can't 
     remember which one it was.  If this is true, won't the fellas at Rod 
     Simpson, and Renegade Hybrids be vindicated??
     
     
     If this is true, I'm hoping that this V-8 would be mid-engined mounted 
     rather than rear.  On the other hand, I suppose a 32-Valve V-8 could 
     be made light enough that it might actually weigh less than the air 
     and watercooled sixes it would be replacing.  
     
     
     Anybody else remember this blurb?  It would have been in the "rumors" 
     or "spy-shots" sections of one of those respective magazines. Better 
     yet, has anybody heard of any more details on this?
