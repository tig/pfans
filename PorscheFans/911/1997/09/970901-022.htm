Harley Myler,

You had requested feedback on Super and Turbo charged Porsches.

Yes, standard turbocharged engines are known for turbo lag.  This doesn't
have to be.  As many Porsche drivers/tuners have found, with the right tw=
eeks
a turbo system can develop boost very early and very strong throughout th=
e
rpm range.  The cost for parts and labor?  Anywhere from $2000 for used p=
arts
and your own labor to as much as $35000 for a tuner to convert your car w=
ith
all new stuff.

Many different supercharging systems are available for Porsche 911s.  The
first and most important thing is the instant throttle response.  One
negative that everyone loves to point out is that the supercharger unit,
being belt driven, robs horsepower.  OK, so what, I loose 5 or even 10 hp=
 but
hey my engine is making 400 to 450 reliable hp!  And at the higher revs i=
t's
85% efficient.
The folks in Knoxville began with the Paxton systems and while they aren'=
t as
efficient or reliable they do offer a substantial performance upgrade.  I
think TechArt offers a similar system. Not sure what they go with for
compression ratio and boost but great results in horsepower.
Supercharging  of Knoxville has offered a Whipplecharger system for a few
years now.  It=92s a very well developed system.  It=92s not a simple bol=
t-on
deal but it is real power. =20
Here's where the personal experience comes in to play.  A little over a y=
ear
ago I had the chance to ride in a Whipplecharged 964 C4 at Texas World
Speedway.  This car was incredible the way that it lunged out of turns an=
d
was ballistic on the straights.  I was hooked!  Earlier this year my drea=
m
came true and I found an  89 Carrera 4 already prepared by Supercharging =
of
Knoxville.  For the last 3 months and 7000 miles I've been driving one of=
 the
first 964 cars that SoK produced. =20
Now don=92t get me wrong, I've driven 930 turbos for years and I love 'em.
 This supercharged system is as good and even better in most ways.  Mine =
is
based on the 3.6 and horsepower figures are 400 with 8 psi of instant boo=
st.
 It is so docile around town and 21 mpg at 75 mph is easy on the road (? =
5
mpg on the race track).  It=92s as quick as many sport bikes (yes, I=92ve
surprised a few crotch rocket pilots).  Another great thing is the top en=
d
performance, I=92ve seen 170 on the speed-o.  It pulls as hard from 120- =
170 as
it does from 60-120 mph.  I bet you can tell that I would recommend the S=
uper
over the Turbo.

SoK also offers the Whipple system for 3.2 Carreras.  More great news is =
that
they are developing a system for 993 owners.  Dynoed horsepower over 500 =
and
a ton of torque.  Keep in mind that with this kind of hp difference a new
race clutch would be recommended.

Anyone else out there with friendly comments?
