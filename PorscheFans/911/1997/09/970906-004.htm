Hello,
    I am having quite a problem with my "new" '89 911 C4. I picked it up on 
Wednesday evening, drove it home, and parked it. Everything was fine the next 
morning, and throughout the day. After I got home from work I washed it, and 
then moved it so that it wasn't in my mother's way when she returned home. 
That was about 7:30 p.m. At 9:00 p.m. I went out to move it into the driveway, 
and the battery was dead. I jump started it, and drove it around a bit, and 
got enough of a charge into it so it would restart. 20 minutes later the 
interior lights were dimmer, and I was sure that the battery was loosing its 
charge. I then removed the hot lead over night so that I could determine if 
there was a draw from the car, or the battery was just loosing it by itself. 
After reconnecting it in the morning it started up fine. I went out to leave 
about 45 minutes later, and it was again dead. I spoke with the mechanic who 
has worked on the car since new, and he said it had to be the battery, and 
that it sounded like one or two cells were bad. I replaced the battery that 
morning, and drove the car to work. It seemed fine all day,. I parked it about 
8:00 at night, and according to the clock, it died at 2:15 in the morning, 
only 6 hours later. I obviously have a huge drain on the battery. 
     As far as I can tell, everything is turned off. I don't know what it 
could be. I measured the draw between the positive lead for the car, and the 
positive on the battery as being about 7.3 volts, but that is all that the 
battery had left in it at that point. Something is sucking the battery dry. I 
kept the meter connected between the positive lead and the battery, and 
removed every single fuse and relay one by one, figuring that when I pulled 
the fuse for the circuit that was pulling the power, the draw would drop 
significantly. Nothing affected the draw. 
      The only known, or disclosed, problem when I bought the car was that the 
climate control system was not functioning properly. The fan would come on 
with the system set to blow cold air, but would die when turned up to a warmer 
temperature. While looking for my elusive electrical draw, I found that the 
fuse for the heater blower in the engine compartment fuse box was blown. I do 
not know if this could be related to the problem or not. 
     I thought that  it is possible that there is a short somewhere, but I 
don't hear any crackling, and there is no smoke, or anything getting hot. I am 
not extremely familiar with electrical systems and how they work, so I need 
some help.
     I would really like to figure this out. No service shops in my area are 
open on Saturday, so I am stuck until Monday. Besides, I would like to help 
figure it out myself as it is bugging me to death. If anyone has any ideas 
about what could be happening, or has possibly had his problem before, could 
you please let me know what else it might be? I would greatly appreciate any 
help that I could get. Please call me at (414) 633-4585, or email me. 
Regards,
    --Josh Armantrout
