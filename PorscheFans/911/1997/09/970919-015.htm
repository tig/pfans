Definitely yes!  Not only is that compressor heavy, but it is Out Back
and Up High... the pessimal place for it from a handling standpoint. 
(If Dr. Porsche spun in his grave for anything, it was when they hung
that iron lump a foot above and five feet behind the CG of his car...)
You'll notice the difference right away.  In my experience the
improvement is most noticeable in transitions as opposed to steady state
cornering, i.e. more in auto-x or twisty-road situations, but for the
first week you'll notice it every time you turn the wheel or step on the
gas.

Don't think so.  When the A/C's off, the compressor is de-clutched,
leaving only the unloaded belt's parasitic drag which isn't much.

IMO the compressor (and bracket) are 90% of the problem... the various
heat exchangers are aluminum and the lines are mostly rubber, and add up
to probably only 20-25 pounds or so all told.  If you have any thought
of resale value and getting the system working again, I'd say to leave
the rest of it intact... and sealed with a dry gas fill.  On the other
hand, after my compressor had been out for a year, I decided to make
Holy War on the rest of the system, down to the last hose and clip and
screw... and I modified the evaporator blower to supply additional fresh
air to the cabin via the A/C vents.  But pulling the compressor was the
main thing that helped handling and performance...

hope this helps,
