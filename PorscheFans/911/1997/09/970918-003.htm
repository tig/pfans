You're assuming that a 'normal' Porsche would be safer. I've seen
modified 914's (stock motor) go on fire (bodywork too close to exhaust), 
911's blow oil lines and oil tracks, and 944 turbo motors 
explode (too much boost) and cover the entire line with coolant and oil. 

Just because there is a Porsche case in the engine compartment doesn't
make the car ANY safer than a car with some alien motor. Unsafe
modifications are unsage, regardless of the motor. I thought that
safety inspections were supposed to prevent unsafe vehicles from
participating in events.
