Re Warren C's question about location of Performance Aire, they're at
1885 S. Santa Cruz St., Anaheim CA 92805, phone 714-634-9184.  They were
sticking with freon as of 2 years ago, but this may have changed.  Also,
their units use barrier hoses that will take the new stuff (which isn't
much cheaper--and is why we have the new stuff actually--DuPont's patent
on freon ran out and guess who produces R134a?).  Anyway, they're very
good.  

OTOH, stay away from ICE (International Conditioning Enterprises).  They
have an 800 number but that's their only plus.  I wasted 500 bucks parts
and labor on a crappy condenser they sent me--first one was missing an
end piece and the freon went poof out the side when it was charged up. 
Double work, double expense, for a condenser that was inadequate for the
job in the first place.

"Even the bad things are better than they used to be.  Bad music, for
instance, has gotten much briefer.  Wagner's 'Ring Cycle' takes four
days to perform while 'Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm' by the Crash Test Dummies lasts
little more than three minutes."  --P.J. O'Rourke
