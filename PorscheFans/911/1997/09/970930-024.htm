 You know you have too much horsepower when...



1. The emissions test guy starts laughing as soon as you pull onto the 
   rollers.

2. You can't drive your car in the rain.

3. Your 'significant other' is afraid to drive your car.

4. You are afraid to drive your car.

5. You spend more on tires than on food.

6. You spend more on car insurance than on house payments.

7. You look in a state police car and see a picture of your car taped to
   the dash.

8. You throw your underwear in the garbage rather than the hamper.

9. You have to go to the track to buy gas.

10. Your mechanic names the new wing of his shop after you.

11. Jacque Villeneuve and Michael Schumacher wave you by.

12. You can make the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.

13. You're tempted to wear your fire suit just to drive to the office.

14. Red signal lights shift to green as you're approaching then shift 
    back to red as you're receeding.

15. You arrive somewhere before you left.

16. You get pulled over for doing 155 in a 35 but the cops
    will let you go if "they can look under the hood."

17. "Civic? What Honda Civic? Where?", is all you can think
    to say to the policeman frowning at you.

18. You are not allowed to run in the Silver State Challenge.

19. You get an anonymous phone call asking if you are interested
    in being in the Cannonball Run.

20. Your face looks like you are riding a NASA centrifuge when
    you drive the car.

22. You need parachute braking.
