Subject: Distributor Vacuum on a '72 911 converted to carbs

I own a '72s which was converted to carbs by the PO.  I have recently
installed a new distributor because the old one was worn out.  I would like
to know where or how I can obtain a intake vacuum source.  The intake
manifolds have a casting depression over the #2 and #4 cylinders, and one
of
these I drilled out only to discover that a pulsing vacuum source is
located
here.  Duh,  I would have realized this had I thought at all about it
first,
the valve opens=vacuum,  valve close, etc.  Is there a way to hook up the
vacuum with carbs and K+N filters(i.e. no air cleaner air box)?  The reason
that I would like to do this is to obtain ~35 degrees at 6000 rpm, without
setting the timing beyond TDC at 900 rpm.

TIA, Mark

I did a lot of work with distributors when I converted my mustang to
MSD and holly fuel injection.  What you want for your distributor is
a vacuum source, usually called *spark* vacuum, which can be used
to advance the distributor at idle and coasting condtions - this advance
is used for idle stabilization and fuel economy only (in my experience).

I'm suprised you cannot find a vacuum source on one of your carbs -
the reason your drilling did not work is that you found maniflold vacuum,
not this *spark*, or throttle vacuum.

Back to the original discussion, the vacuum caused at idle, which is
advancing the distributor, disapears when you open the throttle (and
lose the vacuum - think about it - at WOT there's not much of a vacuum
in the intake or carbs - the air flows unrestricted).  If this vacuum
advance
did not disappear off idle, then the spark would be too far advanced for 
the RPM's, and the engine would ping detonate.  

The 35 degrees you want at 6000 rpm has to come from somewhere
else - centrifigual(sp?) weights and springs, etc.  My MSD distributor
was fully programmable, with several different weights, springs, and max
advance, etc.  Nowadays, with my 89 carrerra 3.2, the distributor is fixed,
and the motronic DME does ALL the advance - idle stabilization, advance
curves, etc.  Computers are wonderful in this respect, and a lot more 
reliable then weights and vacuum hoses.

Hope all this rambling helps - I know all you were looking for was a vacuum
source!
