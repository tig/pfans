Hi elfer fans,

I took it upon myself to translate the 996 review featured in the latest =
Auto-Bild.

Warning! This is one "disappointed writer, and he doesn't hide it!"

Here it goes:

I can't hardly comprehend it: They really did it. After 34 years of =
Porsche 911 they have finally taken his soul. He is still called =
Carrera, but it is a soft & washed-out 911. It's over with the charisma =
of inperfection, this Porsche is styled and ironed to the hilt.
Ready for the next millenium, they wanted to make the icon 911; result =
is a sports car, with lots of "de ja vu". Now they've copied themselves, =
just like the Japanese do, but who were never forgiven for it. The =
Carrera 996 has become a dead ringer of the bloated 928. The form is =
almost equal and even in size does the new Carrera come close to the =
928. Lengh: 4,43 meters, 2 meters less than the first 928. Ok, the 928 =
was wider and 100 kilos heavier, but the feeling after a few kilometers =
reminds me strongly of the=20
large travel-coupe (928): A strong touring vehicle, no bite. Face like a =
Boxter: 130 liters trunk in the rear. Good cornering, the Carrera is =
glued to the street. Maybe its the sound? Of course! Until 3000 (rpm) he =
sounds as exciting as a vacuum cleaner.
Beyond that, it gets better, but never dominant. Doesn't have to be =
bothersome, but they could have at least composed a  "badd sound". What =
Honda did with the the NSX, Alfa (romeo) or Ferrari have done under the =
hood (in terms of sound) is 1st class. The Weissach sound-propeller =
heads should be ashamed. At least in neutral(gear)  it sounds =
acceptable. But only the audience at the gas station will be able to =
hear that. First, the motor doesn't sound like Carrera anymore, second =
it doesn't feel as brutal anymore. Another reason for lack of =
performance is probably due to the tiptronic in our test vehicle. Even =
though it has 5 shiftable gears, it just doesn't open up! Therefore the =
996 could not, despite 300hp (DIN) and 24 valves, outperform the 993. =
This may be different with a manual 6 speed gearbox, but a real race car =
it is not supposed to be anymore, anyway.
The Porsche leaders have the SL (Mercedes) customers from their =
Stuttgart neighbor in the crosshair. And for them the soft-porsche is =
indeed an alternative. It is much more comfortable, is less noisy und =
you can finally use your cell phone without screaming in your =
passenger's ear. Is this still a 911? I am sitting in front of a styled =
plastic landscape! Five mauled gauges, hard to read, but full of form =
and style; plenty of mini-switches, nicely arranged, like a =
Sony-Walkman. No ideas, no new solutions, only a drivers seat in a =
sports vehicle. The tail is gone: smooth from front to rear.  Spoiler =
comes up at 120km/h (100m/h). I miss the modern interpretation of the =
911 tradition. A tach in the center is not enough anymore. Why not less =
grey fabrics and more metal? Even here an embarrasing glance to Italy: A =
Fiat Coupe turns you on more! Here, details uncover the love for cars. =
Different with the Carrera: under the fueltank lid, a cheap black =
plastic fuel tank cap. Thanks a lot, beancounters! They've got their =
fingers in everything to do with the Carrera. A third of all parts comes =
from the Boxter. Not really bad, if it weren't so obvious. Front end and =
cockpit are identical, but the Carrera costs almost double (135,610 DM). =
Why must the "big one" have his pimples at the same places the "little =
one" does?
However: The total restyling has its advantages; the 996 is supposedly =
50 % more stable. Too bad, that one can't feel it. Even by swinging the =
door shut, one notices the hollow popping sound. The metal-safe sound of =
the 911 is a thing of the past. Too harsh?
I don't think so. Surely, the new Carrera is a exquisite sports car, =
with a phantastic undercarriage and a super motor. But others can do =
that, too. Porsche has missed its chance to revive the mystical 911. All =
the quirks have been taken away, the last wrinkles ironed out. Each =
improvement would be easy to endure, but the sum of all changes makes =
the 98 Carrera a different car. Here, the "elfer" doesn't pant anymore, =
instead the Porsche 2000 sits cool and calm.

OUCH!!
