Todd,

Thanks for your reply.

Since city driving is the norm for me I guess I'll stick with the
Dual-mass Flywheel.

Is there any benefit to puting a 993 Flywheel and clutch instead of the
964 one, or are they essentially the same?

Yes, there is an advantage.  Bruce Anderson or Andy Warren could give


you the details, I'm sure, but it's my understanding that the 964 flywheel
was one of the weakest links on the car - many were defective and
failed early, including mine.  My mechanic told me that the 993 flywheel is
a substantial improvement, and told me I was smart and lucky to have
found one for him to install.

Good luck!
