  I too have experienced both good and bad encounters w/other Porsche owners
and dealers (Fortunately, mostly good).  I purchased a new 993 back in April.
I had been saving since I was 14 and technically should not be able to own an
$80K car based on my current income BUT I'd always wanted the car and when I
saw that Porsche was changing the car in 99, decided that I shouldn't wait any
longer. (BTW: My vanity plates say NO WATER)  Anyway, I look very young (often
had it guessed at 17 to 19 and am actually 29).  When I first started to visit
the dealers, I had a lot of rude brush offs.  There were really only 2
dealerships that did not give me this 'your just here for a joyride so go away
attitude'.  One was in Milwaukee, WI and the other in Highland Park, IL.
Since I live much closer to Highland Park, that is where I purchased.  I test
drove 4 different 993's before making my final decision -- including highway
driving. The dealers that wouldn't give me the time of day lost a sale and I
will not go there for service either!

  And finally,  I DO talk to folks about my car... and have on occassion let
Folks sit in it at the gas station... I was there.. I recognize the 'drool
factor', the appreciation, etc. etc. and am not going to be rude to others
just because I now have my dream car.  ALSO, I have most definately noticed an
affinity among 911 owners... Any one I ever pass or passes me will wave, flash
lights, honk, nod, or something to acknowledge a fellow Porsche owner :)
The last time I experienced anything like that was when I owned my 73 Super
Beetle in College!  It is a really nice feeling!   Finally, my car is a daily
driver that currently has 4500 miles and I love it, love it, LOVE IT!

  To that 20 year old... keep the dream going... if you work hard enough at
it, and want it badly enough.. you CAN do it!
