In response to the wave/honk/blink and Sport Ute threads:

Here North of Dallas I have found no reaction from any Porsche driver to
a wave or headlight flash save one, the local driver of a white 993
Cab.  When I rode a motorcycle and waved I experienced a near 100%
response rate regardless of make.  Perhaps this just confirms why North
of Dallas has a "Gold Chain" rep - it is deserved!

In reply to Todd Simpson, yes I do find a pattern of treatment towards
the P-car.  My daily driver is a ticket-me-first red Targa, however I do
travel extensively by air and run an old Camry to the airport often.
With regards to the Suburban Assault Vehicles (pickup trucks, vans, and
sport utes) I can pretty much anticipate that I will "...get cut-off
and  tailgated so much, I feel like leaving the car in the garage. It
also seems people just love to pull out right in front of you, even if
it means running a stop sign or even a red light.".  However, I hardly
ever feel like leaving der Wundercar in the garage.  If this is what
those folks need to feel important then their lives are already pretty
sad affairs.  Nothing we can do will serve to punish them more for their
mean, selfish, and stupid acts of arrogance.  After all, one of the
pleasures of driving a Porsche is the ability to escape such situations
and go on our way enjoying and sharing the road.

I am also interested as Mr. Simpson is in hearing muffler
recommendations.
