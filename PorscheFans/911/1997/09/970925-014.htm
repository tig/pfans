Im feeling a little bit fortunate righting to the list this morning. Last
night I picked up my 1970 911T. drove it home about 250 miles & it ran like
it was supposed to. The PO told me the alternator may be going bad, and that
after he charged it it was only holding a charge for maybe 4 days. well I
stopped a few times on my way home & when I got home it was totally dead. So
where do I start to take care of this first little problem. I dont know where
the alternator is. (sorry to sound so 911 ignorant).Im going to take it out &
have it tested first of all. Then if it is bad where is the best place to get
one. Well this is the first of probably many questions.

TIA
