Hi tire buddies:

We read a lot from the racers about pressures for the BFG R1s, but I was
curious how much or how little their findings had in common with the
optimum track settings for the Comp TA street tires.

Luckily, my club here in Japan (don't ask) found itself joined by
Michelin's racing engineers at our last track outing. To make my typical
long story short, the brave guy riding beside me was able to diagnose
how the car felt and prescribe a cure. It turns out that for my C2 at
the track, the factory tire pressures are not really ideal.

For 205/50-17 and 255/40 17 Comp TA ZRs, on my RS America with lowering
kit, the improved set up was 37 lbs front and 40 lbs rear *hot*
pressure. Interestingly, at home the next morning the cold tire
pressures were 31 lbs in all four tires! This is not a setting to
reprint in the next Performance Handbook, but a good place to start from
next time you go to the track.

What was it like? Night and day. The before pressure of 40 lb.x4 (hot) 
made the car rather tippy-toed on the fast sweepers which limited speed
through the curves and (according to the engineer riding shotgun)
limited braking power. And after dropping 3 lbs in front? Boy what a
difference! I wish I had the G-analyst hooked up but I could really feel
the difference as the fronts locked on and carried a lot more speed in
the sweepers (without plowing) and when turning in for the hairpins, the
car just seemed to lunge for the apex as soon as I released the
throttle. Braking was at least twice as effective as before.

BTW, the fronts were only rolling over to within about 3/8 inch of the
edge of the tread, so I might try dropping more pressure next time. At
40lbs, the rears were right at the edge. 

Another set-up tip from Michelin based on their Touring Car Championship
experience: Initially lower the pressure on the inside tires about a
pound for uniform traction. As we all have read, the (predominantly)
outside tires get hotter (because they take more of the weight
transfer?). Lowering the pressure on the inside tires makes them work
that much harder. As a result you end up with equal temperatures and
tire pressures when the tires reach racing temperature.
