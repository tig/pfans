The early '87's had a clutch activation problem (this was the initial
introduction of the G50 trans) that was "solved" by a retrofit kit applied
to the throwout arm, I believe. The kit required milling/drilling of the
tranny case and was done by a dealer. I believe it is discussed in the shop
manuals and others have posted more accurate descriptions of it.

I don't even know if mine has the problem or the fix (and it was an early
'87), the clutch has always felt "ok" to me. Maybe you shouldn't have
driven your buddys car ;-)
