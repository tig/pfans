 I thought it will never happen to me. I am wrong.

My 78 930 is not starting this morning. I have no clue what is going on.

Early this week, my wife found my "the-nice-one" porsche keys that I =
lost for more than a year. And I was trying to drive the 930 to work =
because this is Friday. So I sticked the "nice" key in the car, and =
tried to start the car. Surprise! surprise! It is not starting. Last =
time, I drove the car was about two weeks ago.=20

What is this? The cold starting problem (I am in California)? There is =
some noise from the front of the car after the un-successful start. I =
was just so scared. Oh! well.

I don't know what to do now. What can I try before towing it to the =
shop? Please help. And at the same time, I will try to dig out all the =
old porschefans e-mails about the Cold Start thing.

Thanks a lot.
