I have placed jack stands under the torsion bar tube in the 
rear to remove the engine and transmission in my 72 and 85 911's.  I 
have removed the engine and trans in the 72 about a half a dozen 
times using this method. The early model cars are much easier to 
remove the engine and transmission from as the license plate panel 
may be removed, thus not requiring that the car be raised as high. 
Use good jack stands and a good floor jack. I have also had good 
results using a transmission jack that had wheels (about $100 from 
Sears) as a support for the engine and trans unit. Good Luck.
