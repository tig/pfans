I would like to thank everyone that answered my tensioner failure message.
The mechanic opened the tensioner housings and checked the tensioners, and
they are OK. The noise is not coming from the chain. At this point he has a
number of theories to explain the knocking sound: one of them is that the
tensioner itself might be loose (even though it doesn't move at all when
pushed by hand), and that at high RPMs with the tremendous force it has to
sustain it rattles or, something even more serious like a rod bearing.

Clearly they'll fix it, whatever it is; there's no question they can do it.
The question is: who's responsible? The only work they did on the engine
itself was adjusting the valves and of course pulling it out of the car.
All the work done was done on the transmission. They didn't knock or hit
the engine in any way. The noise was not there when I took the car in.
Since the problem happened while the car was at the shop, are they
responsible to fix it? What if the problem has nothing to do with the work
they performed, but it just happened while the car sat there for two weeks?
Am I responsible to pay for the repair then?

Please respond directly to me.


Thanks,

Gabriel
