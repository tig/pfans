<<(which btw looks exactly like the

stock, installed with double-sided tape over you existing mirror) gives you
40

degress visibility.  Also has anyone tried the "lanechanger" mirror?
(attaches

to the top of the rearview mirror?>>

Andy,
I have a customer who has these in two of his cars (a Jeep Cherokee Sport and
a MAzda 626).  I can never use the rear view mirror when I drive his cars b/c
these stupid mirrors give me an instant headache and a naseous feeling.  They
distort the rear view quite a bit and stretch it all out sideways (which may
be what makes me feel sick).  It's one of the most annoying things I've ever
seen in a car though.  Just keep looking over your shoulder and spend the $40
on a days worth of gas for spirited driving!
