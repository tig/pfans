Does anyone have or seen BOTH the new stoddard 911 catalog and the new
porsche parts catalog(pna 000-147)? The reason I ask is I have the
stoddard catalog, and so I called them to order the porsche catalog.
What they sent me was another one of their catalogs. When I called them
to explain the mixup, they said that THEY superceded the porsche catalog
with their own because their's was better, but that they would refund my
money since I already had their catalog.
My question is: Is their catalog really better than the porsche one or
are they simply promoting their own catalog for financial reasons. Is it
worth getting the porsche book from another source? While I've found
that stoddard's catalog is very good, I don't think that it is really
complete(but I've never seen the new porsche book for a comparison).
