I have a simple question, I been thinking about it for a while and tried

to find out. But I ahven=B4t had any luck yet.
I got a 911 SC 1983 my qustion is what does SC stand for.

The answer is "Super Carrera".  Some will argue that it means 'standard
car", but that is just plain wrong.
I arrived at this conclusion after much reading, especially of Clive
Prew's work.
The S is in the tradition of Porsche designating a car which has
superior engine and trim levels to the base car, a tradition that goes
back to the 356 and started in the 911 series in '67.  The C comes from
Carrera, which was the name of the 3.0 litre car which the SC
succeeded...and which gave a detuned version of its engine to the SC.
the base model before that had a 2.7 litre engine.

Some of us have speculated that the designers were calling the car  an S
Carrera on their work sheets and the SC name evolved from there.

Anyone who can provide a direct quote on this subject would be doing us
all a favor.
