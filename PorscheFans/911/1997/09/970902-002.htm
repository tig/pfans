Hi all 



sorry about the duplicate message before - machine screwing up.



info for ROSS regarding:  Brake Light Switch Keeps Failing.



As a possible guess to the reason for the switch failure, I think 
there is too much current passing through the brake light circuit. This 
could be caused by increased power lamps (watts) of the brake light  or 
possibly the addition of a third brake light.



The increased current through the circuit could be causing arcing 
across the switch contacts and causing the switch contacts to 
stick/bond/melt.



There could be 3 possible solutions from my chain of thought, 
considering of course that the correct switch is installed and no physical force 
is damaging it:



1) check the total wattage of the brake lights, and get appropriate 
lamps to consider total current flow/power consumption in the circuit.



2) Try putting a capacitor/condensor accross the brake switch 
contacts, anything similar to ones mounted accross mechanical points should 
suffice.



3) Use a relay in the circuit to allow possible increase in circuit 
current. the brake switch should turn on the relay (a low current 
circuit), the switched output from the relay should should have a high current 
rating to allow high current to pass. Dont forget to put a diode across 
the coil of the relay, and a capacitor accross the switch contacts of the 
relay.



Hope this helps



Tarik
