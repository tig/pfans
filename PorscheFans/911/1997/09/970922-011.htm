Greetings 911ers


I have recently purchased a set of really nice Harman 3 piece wheels for my 
stock '89 911 based on the
Advice of an SF wheelhouse.

I don't think these rascals are gonna fit without rubbing or dragging 
something.

Stock		Purchased
205.55.26	205.50.17	Front
225.50.16	255.40.17	Rear

When I opened the box they looked to big, so I jacked up the rear and dry 
mounted just the new hub
The rim was 1/4" from the upper oil lines and 3/8" from the adjusting nut on 
the arm. The rim extends 1" past the fender when jacked up.

The salesman said they  would fit, they mount this set up all the time. And 
the Wheels bow out when jacked up...

Who know the best wheel set up to go to 17" and stay stock on the rest of the 
set up

Help.......DAMIFINO!

Thanks Bill
