Brian, Apparently I did not do a perfect job of making my point. Your
introduction and tone portray an air of disagreement yet nothing you typed
disagreed with my posting...?
But then I must say, of course adding components... "can make a
difference..."  -  "can" being the operative word. But "will make a positive
difference" is the expectation when we put our money down isn't it? 

Actually my main point was "tuning" the engine to the components as a systems
approach not simply adding several components at one time. Your B&B example
is a good one seeing how they custom made me some headers which, with my
otherwise bone stock 3.2 DME motor, made some nice increase in torque and hp.
However it wasn't until we added a chip tuned to the headers that I realized
the full benefit from the headers. When I take off the street muffler and
bolt on the race pipes I should also have a chip tuned for that set of
conditions along with the change in fuel type I will be racing with (someday
I'll afford that too God and wife willing...).

Again as I tried to say before, tuning the motor - adjusting the cam timing
and ignition timing (chip mapping) for instance - is usually (if not always)
necessary to optimize a change in induction, ignition or exhaust components.
 As I posted before, we saw several backpressure reducing exhausts REDUCE
engine torque and/or horsepower when simply bolted on and it took engine
tuning to realize any benefit at all. Another example - we removed the airbox
cover and filter from a 3.0 CIS engine and lost 5 rearwheel hp - dispelling
our expectations of less restriction = more power.
Respectfully yours,
Ross

<<>> Half and half.  I'll give you an "AM"  I'd say that all the things you
have mentioned (muffler, headers, spark plugs, wires,  inlet valve, air
filter, fuel pressure regulator, etc., etc...) sound like a full system
approach to me!  Fuel, fire and air.  And I think adding things like headers
and exhaust can net differences in each type of car.  For instance, putting
exhaust, a chip, and K & N air filter on my 1987 928S4 made a very noticeable
difference in driveability and performance.  And just talk to a 930 owner
about headers and a muffler (B & B shows dyno hp increases of up to 40hp, I
believe).  You are correct that one thing at a time may not help much, but a
few things together can.
 But you know what they say- opinions are like a**holes.  Everyone has one.
