    Clemson:

    I have no idea what tickets cost.  As to best seating location,
    though...

> Trackside Tower Suites

    PRO:  Plush and air-conditioned.
    CON:  No outdoor balcony seating, so it's not too involving.  The 
          view isn't real good, and these seats are (presumably) 
          expensive.

> Turn 11 Hospitality

    This is a grassy area right at the center of the outside of the
    big horseshoe turn.

    PRO:  I'd expect it to be tented, so there'll be some shade.  The 
          cars come straight at you at the fastest point on the 
          track.  There's a good view of the pits.
    CON:  Noisy.  You're only about five feet above the surface of 
          the track, so you don't have a particularly commanding 
          view.

> Turn 2 Grandstand Seating

    From these seats, the cars come at you uphill from the right.

    PRO:  Turn 2 is a prime passing-under-the-brakes area, so you'll 
          probably see some exciting action.  This is the part of the 
          track where the cars do that dramatic 
          driving-over-the-curbs thing.
    CON:  You can only see the cars briefly on each lap.

> Turn 8 and 9 Grandstands

    PRO:  They recently moved a hill out of the way, so you can see 
          something like 80% of the circuit from here.
    CON:  Sears Point is laid out like a three-leaf clover.  These 
          grandstands are at the "stem" of the clover, so all the 
          action is far away... Even the closest point on the track 
          will probably be 100 feet away from your seats.  Also, 
          you'll be in broad sunlight all afternoon, so you MUST 
          bring heavy-duty sunscreen... I'd almost be tempted to get 
          seats on the top row so I could bring an umbrella.

> Start/Finish Grandstands

    These grandstands were recently added, primarily for viewing the 
    drag races.

    PRO:  None, except that you'll be able to see the finish line.
    CON:  Direct sun.

> Turn 2 Hospitality

    Another grassy area, but this one's BIG.

    PRO:  Probably tented, so there'll be shade.  Faces east, so the 
          sun will be behind you all afternoon.  Large enough to
          walk around and see the track from lots of vantage
          points... You should be able to see Turns 2 and 3, and you
          can look across the canyon to 7,8,9, and 11 (the
          grandstands block the view between 9 and 11).
    CON:  None that I can think of.

    If it were me, I'd probably choose either the Turn 2 Hospitality 
    area or the Turn 8/9 Grandstands.

    Hope this helps.
