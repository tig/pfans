Randy, based on the parts books, it looks like you'll need to buy a new =
headlight retainer if you want to switch.  This is what the cars up to =
1986 had, before it was replaced by the complete H5 assembly.  These =
don't seem to be that expensive, maybe $75 new, based on some price =
lists I have around.  I'm sure you could find some used.  I think you =
want part number 901.631.103.02.  It should just screw onto the mounting =
tabs that already exist on the fender.  If you go this route, you may =
need new trim rings too.

The H5 prices are so high because they include the complete headlight, =
including the mounting frame.  If you only need the lense/reflector, you =
can get away with spending a lot less.  An old Tweeks catalog I have has =
this piece for about $150.  Again, I bet you can find these parts used =
too.

Hope this helps!
