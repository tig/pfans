Well, I don't exactly understand why one would use nitrogen rather
than air, but it isn't for the reasons you describe. Air is about 78%
nitrogen, so the diffusion argument doesn't fly. The N2 would just
diffuse out and concentrate the O2 in the tire. This doesn't happen
because the diffusion rate is proportional to the molecular weight of
the gas, and since N2 is 28 g/mol and O2 is 32 g/mol there is little
difference in their diffusion rates.

As for the fire thing, that seems to make little sense given the
large amount of air already available outside the tire.

The only reason I would guess that N2 was used rather than air is
to take advantage of the purity. There are two things relative to
purity that might make sense:

1. Pure N2 is clean and dry.
2. Pure N2 might have better thermal characteristics than regular
   old air. Probably it heats and cools at a more reproducible rate
   thus providing more predictable tire performance on, say, an F1
   car. (I am certain my 911 AutoX weapon wouldn't care.)
