Denny,

I'll add my 2 cents worth concerning a 930/911 Turbo for an everyday driver.  I had 1980 930 
Turbo.  It was a Euro version, lowered, and a special performance edition.  I did not feel that it 
was a daily driver... a lot of fun yes, but the suspension was much stiffer than a 911's and it 
was so low that I had to pick my routes.  Colorado must have more dips than other parts of the 
country, but I really had to be careful.  On the highways it was a blast, but in town it was a 
pain.  I purchased a used Honda Accord for running around town, and the winter months, and that 
worked great for me.  

The upkeep does cost more for the Turbo, but it didn't seem to bad for what it is.  I'd guess 
maybe 50% more, if you drive it hard maybe double.
