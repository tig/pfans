I'm taking for it for 24hrs to see how I get on with it, and after I decide
that I do like it :-), I'm going to get it checked out by a Porsche
mechanic who also races 911s. The car has a FPSH and if all goes well I'll
own it by the weekend.

BTW is there a 911 FAQ available anywhere?

"What to look for" would make a whole magazine article. I strongly suggest,
as the short version, that you find a Porsche-experienced mechanic you
trust, and have a thorough pre-purchase inspection done on the car,
including a compression and leak-down test, and have the mechanic drive the
car. Cost will run around $200, and be worth every penny.

Generally, try to get hold of prior maintenance records; if they exist and
you can see them, it's a good sign. If you can't look during the
pre-purchase inspection for signs that the engine has been out of the car
(wrench marks on the  engine mount bolts; broken paint around the bolt
heads). Examine the underside closely for scuff marks, replacement
undercoating, bent suspension members, etc.). Sight along the body from the
front and rear to check straightness and panel fit. There seem to be few
problems that're endemic to these cars, as they represent the fourth year
of the 3.2 Carrera series.

Just bought an '87 Targa myself. Have fun!
