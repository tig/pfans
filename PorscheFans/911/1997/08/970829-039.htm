Hey pfans,

Been away for a while for various reasons:  July was work month from
hell, August was vacation (!), and somewhere during July I
was arbitrarily flung from the list (again).  Anyway,
thank doG (see: dyslexic, agnostic, insomniac joke) for the
Web viewable list.

While reading David Greenberg's disturbing story re: clutch and
valve adjust job where all subsequent mechanics look at the car
and say: "seems like you need a clutch job and valve adjustment",
I'm reminded of C&D artical by Bedard years ago describing
type of service he referred to as a "wall job".  Essentially,
they keep your car for about a week, park it by the wall, never
touch it, and then charge you for the alleged work.

Not to leap to conclusions, but when it looks like a duck, sounds
like a duck, (and steers like a cow :) then I'd be calling the BAR
or whatever they have in your state.

Good luck,

Vol

Currently getting it's nose painted because some klutz (who will remain
nameless) backed out of a parking spot and clipped a concrete pole
on the left front fender/bumper/turn signal assembly.  I'm
sure you can picture it:  Backing out, looking over right shoulder,
turning wheel to the right a *little* too soon and managing to
prang the pole at the precise confluence of these three
sub-assemblies.  Yes the maximum damage at the minimum possible
speed, and all TOTALLY AVOIDABLE !!!!  Excuse me while I take my
medication.  $3900.00 insurance settlement and two months of shop
time later....  So the whole front end will get painted and it will
look great, making the rear look even worse, because yes if I had
to pick I would have chosen the REAR of the car to work on since
the front was actually in great shape....
