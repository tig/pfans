Only to replace the torn section.

If the seats have been let go yo such a bad state, there's not much we can
do exept retrim them. If you get them redone, KEEP THEM OUT OF THE SUN as
much as possible and they won't crack up and last you years. If the car
sits in the sun all the time, it's not worth spending all that money on
leather and I would use a cheaper vinyl in that case.

> 3)  Any recommendations for repair shops in San Antonio, Texas.

Don't know, I'm in Australia.

> Thanks for your help.
