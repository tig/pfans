Ed,

I had the *exact* same thing happen to me when I first bought my '78
911, about five years ago.  In my case, it was the starter; the darn
thing had been too hot too many times.  You might try something like
this to get it started:  turn the key to "start" for 10 seconds.  If
your problem is the same as mine, nothing will happen.  Now wait 30
seconds to a minute and try again.  The starter should engage.

I haven't had the problem since the starter was replaced.
