Tim Brian reports:" In a moment of haste last night I managed to
break/tear the drivers side interior door latch of my 84 Coupe. I haven't
had time to examine the latch closely but I thought I would ask some
questions here first:  1) Is it possible, and if so, how difficult is it to
replace just the latch?  2) I've always thought the latches were rather
flimsy, is there a more robust replacement part, OEM or after market
available?" 

Tim - you are not the first to break one of these.  As to replacing,
it is not difficult - a little minor disassembly of the relevant area is all. 
Fifteen minutes, maybe?  As to a better mousetrap, Automotion sells an
aluminum replacement for $25, or $37 with an inlaid crest no less.   You
may need the little white plastic door handle clip as well, a bargain at
$1.50.  I can't vouch for the aluminum handle (spouse's concours car,
you know).  

The plastic OEM replacements cost less than $25, I think.  They have a
small whitish, luminescent looking dot (function, if any, unknown to me)
cast into them, which is not original before some year or other (84
Carrera did not have this dot), but so far no concours judge has had
such an eagle eye.
