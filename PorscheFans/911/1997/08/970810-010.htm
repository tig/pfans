Having done through the 78 911SC experience I highly recommend:

1. Pull the valve covers to be sure all head studs are in place. Corrosion on
the lower studs particularly have been a problem.

2. Check what maintenance has been done on the chain tensioners. Preferably
have been updated to Carrera type.

3.Check what maintenance has been done on the transmission. Preferably clutch
has been updated.

4. Even if the trans has been rebuilt recently drive the car checking in
particular for synchro performance when shifting gears. Alot of 911 owners
try to speed shift and wear out the synchros quickly - especially in 2nd and
3rd gears leaving you with a $900 to $1500 trans repair on the close horizon.

5. Measure the brake rotor thicknesses. This isn't a big $ item but gives you
an idea what to expect in the future if they need to be, or will soon need to
be, replaced.

This isn't everything of course but some important items I find are
frequently overlooked.

Lastly I would never by a Porsche (or just about any car for that matter) if
the owner doesn't have a paper trail through the entire life of the car.
Proper maintenance and upgrading is THE key for long loving life with these
fine cars. 

Good luck hope it's the right one!
Ross
