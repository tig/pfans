While doing my first attempts at suspension alignment work, I have been jacking
up the 911 back and forth quite a bit.  I have a floor jack and 4 stands.  To
minimize the up and down iterations, I would like to know if there are
additional points where I can safely jack the car up or put stands under it. 
So far I have limited myself to jacking up using the 4 points where there are
pads welded on (the 4 that are used by the shop when they lift the whole car
up), and I've only used jack stands under the rear torsion bar tubes (hope that
is OK, looked pretty sturdy).

I'd like to find some additional points so I can jack up the front alone,
somewhere near front center, and then place stands under the two side front
welded pads.  Is there such a point?  How about in back, is there a place to
jack up the car so the whole rear comes up?

BTW, a cheap weight balancing idea I have that's motivating these questions is
to jack up both front wheels and setting the front body on level jack stands,
all without significantly disturbing the rear suspension (therefore the
question about a jack point in front center).  This should remove the front
suspension from affecting the rear measurements (to first order).  Then
disconnect the rear sway bar, and measure rear ride heights under these
conditions.  This should give required first order ride height adjustment
amounts for the rear wheels only, independent of the contribution of the front
misadjustments or other factors.  Once the rears are set to equal ride heights,
remaining weight imbalances can be tuned out with the front adjustment bolts. 
I think you really want to get the rear heights & weights adjusted reasonably
closely once, then tune with fronts.

Thanks,
