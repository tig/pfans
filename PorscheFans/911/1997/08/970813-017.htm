I am glad that you have had good dealings with Dan. My experience 
was just the opposite. I bought some hard oil lines for my 72 911 
from him based on an ad in Panorama. He described the lines as being 
in good condition, with a samll pinch in one of them, but no leaks. 
When I received the lines the "small pinch" turned out to be a split 
about two inches long. As light was visible through this split, I did 
not test his assertion that the line did not leak. This is the only 
time I have ever had trouble with purchasing something out of the ads 
in Panorama. Perhaps he is better to deal with face-to-face.
