I got several good responses to my recent question about oil coolers and 
temperatures which didn't get on the net. My question, and the useful answers 
I got, are digested below. Most extraneous comments have been edited out. 
Hope this is useful. Jim Taylor, 73.5 911T

Q. Could Scott who commented on the B&B oil cooler drop me a line? I saw 
250 degrees F last week while lapping the track at (hot) Willow Springs & didn't 
like it.  
A. I think you are probably talking about Scott Berry. We both live in the 
Portland, Oregon area. Scott helped us out last weekend on the tech line at 
the club race. His car is a '73T coupe with a CIS motor. I'm not sure if it's a 2.4 
or a 2.7ltr. Probably a 2.7ltr.. He installed The thermostat and hard lines from an 
SC, with an RS style cooler mounted in the front bumper. This setup will run 
around $200 for the tubes, $ 3-400 for the thermostat, and $ 2-400 for the 
cooler depending on what type you get. Some people prefer a new unit. 
Others will make do with a used Mazda unit at a much lower price.
	  My car is a '71E coupe with a warmed over 2.7 w/weber carbs. I run a 
Turbotrol fender cooler with soft lines and a Mocal thermostat. The hoses are 
tucked up along the rocker on the passengers' side of the car. The thermostat is 
mounted in the wheelwell on the same side. I bought the setup used off a race 
car and it uses -12 SAE type fittings. A 27mm to -12 fitting was required at the 
oil tank. I believe no such adapter is needed for the SC setup as the fitting size 
was changed to 30mm in '72 or '73. All the fittings on the SC setup are 30mm.. 
The whole setup cost me $ 350. I did have to buy about 6' of hose and some 
-12 fittings to complete the installation, which I did myself. The fender cooler 
works well, with max. engine temps around 200 degrees on the hottest days 
with the factory air conditioning on. More typical weather usually sees the temp 
go up to 180 and stay there. That is where the thermostat opens and it pretty 
much stays there unless it is really hot out. At this time, I am considering 
changing to the SC hard lines and thermostat, mainly for cosmetic reasons. 
Hope this helps, Dave Singer... DHSinger@compuserve.com
	  Another response... I've got a B&B in the front right, I like them, were 
referred to them by bruce anderson and others.  They have the porsche fittings, 
no weird adapters needed.  I paid my mechanic to do it, it was pretty extensive 
since I didn't have a cooler at all before, I had to get the hard lines, and all, it 
was several shop hours, but well worth it, now even in the peak of summer, 
rarely hits 210, used to hit 250 on super hot days, idling in traffic.  From: Ted 
Matsumura... tedm@tedm.com
  	Another comment...Man, 250 degrees would put the fear of God into me ! 
Made another freeway run with the car today. Outside temperature 85 - 90 
degrees. Engine temperature held steady at approx. 195 -200 with the AC 
running. I had this same setup on another car without AC and the oil temp 
never exceeded 190....Dave Singer
	 Another response... We put a B&B cooler on a 930 last year.  The part was 
extremely well built and installation was pretty easy. The cooler was installed in 
the front valance and the car had a run-in with the wall at Pocono.  It (the wall) 
took out the fender, valance and other parts.  The oil cooler was twisted but still 
held pressure.  We straighten it out and reinstalled it when we replaced the 
fender. The reason we put the oil cooler on was it was running to hot.  It is a 
930 with a bigger turbo , inter-cooler.. well you get the idea.  The car (engine) 
would approach 230-240 degrees at the track, and on the street on hot days, 
and we wanted to bring the temps down a little.  After the cooler was added 
the temps stayed in the 190-200 degree range. That was changing the cooler as 
well as repositioning it from the fender to the valance.  I read somewhere that 
you can drop the temp 10-15 degrees just by moving the stock cooler to the 
front valance.  So, I don't think it is fair to say that the temps dropped 40 
degrees just by adding a cooler. But I think you could expect 25 degrees so just 
by changing from the stock cooler (23 row brass) to the B&B."Michael R. 
Andrews"<michaelrandrews@unn.unisys.com
	 Another response...I am extremely pleased with the quality and results of the 
B&B oil cooler I have.  It works very well.  I installed a complete oil system (hard 
lines from rear to front, thermostat, etc)  This is a big and expensive job!  I am by 
no means an accomplished mechanic - but I took several months over the 
winter to do the work.  AN average semi-skilled can do the installation IF you 
are not in a rush and remain patient.  It was fun and now my oil temps stay at 
about 190 no matter what I do.  Do you have a 2.4 in your car or something 
else?  A stock 2.4T won't need much of an oil cooler.  A front fender mounted 
one would be sufficient. From:  scott.d.berry@bangate1.TEK.COM
	 Another response...I tried three different coolers on my car--the Terbatrol, the 
28-tube brass ('84 Euro), and the '87 Carrera.  The '87 has a thermostatically
controlled fan and a shroud that fills the fender opening, forcing the air to go 
through the cooler. I bought it used for $450, including the '87 fender brace 
and horn mount, which you will need to relocate the horns. If you go this route, 
I strongly recommend having it ultrasonically cleaned ($35) before installation. 
All of these parts new cost about $1500. If you already have a front fender 
cooler, installation is not difficult. Just be sure to counter-hold the oil line fittings 
so you don't twist them. I have heard good things about the B&B cooler. They 
also make a fan for it. Bob Tindel... btindel@gte.net...83SC 
	 Another response.... Have had two B&B Oil Coolers.  First the fender mount, 
which was very easy to install on my 80 SC and next the front valance mount, 
which was somewhat more difficult as\they leave it to you to fabricate brackets 
but is also essentially a bolt in as it comes with the correct lines to the factory 
hard lines.  Very nice quality.  Significantly reduced the oil temperature even 
on the track in hot weather.  Bruce...Christie/Bruce Boeder           Phone:

	 Another response...73.5 T's don't run hot unless something is very wrong.  


These CIS 2.4s are among the more bullet proof of 911 engines and are lightly 
stressed so they usually run cool.  I live in a very hot climate and rarely see mine 
hit 200 degrees on the oil temp gauge even when pushed hard.  I would check:
1) something obstructing the air flow over the oil cooler or over the cylinders.  
On your engine there is a light grey colored piece of plastic that channels air 
from the main air duct (the big black plastic piece that attaches to the fan 
housing & covers most of the top of the engine) back to the oil cooler.  It is on 
the passenger side of the engine at the back of the engine compartment.  It is a 
bit hard to get to, but not impossible.  Take off the grey colored piece of plastic. 
That will expose the top edge of the oil cooler.  See if the fan picked up a piece 
of paper or something that is blocking the flow of air over the cooler.  Also, if 
your car sat for a long time this is an area mice like to nest in, so you could have 
the nest remains of an uninvited guest blocking the top of the oil cooler!
2) next check the fuel-air mixture - if it is way too lean it could cause the engine 
to run hot.  The mixture is changed by inserting a 3mm alan key into a hole in 
the top of the fuel distributor and turning a screw on the air plate. Turning 
clockwise richens the mixture, counter clockwise leans out the mixture. A 
quarter of a turn on this screw changes the mixture a lot!  You will need a CO2 
meter to really get this right, so would best be done by a Porsche mechanic.
3) if those two are ok, then check for a leaking piston to block connection 
which would allow hot combustion chamber gases to leak and overheat one 
side.  You can usually hear these.  They sound like a leaking exhaust, only near 
the block instead of out near the head area.   Your best check here is a leak 
down test (you will need a special tool) or a less reliable compression test.  You 
can buy or rent a compression tester at most auto stores for ~$20.  Remove all 
the plugs, PULL THE FUSE ON THE FUEL PUMP SO YOU DON'T SQUIRT 
RAW GAS ALL OVER, screw the tester into one cylinder and crank the engine 
over with the starter a fixed number of times - say 12- WHILE HOLDING THE 
THROTTLE ALL THE WAY OPEN.  Read the pressure in each cylinder this way 
in turn. All the readings should be within a few pounds of the same and all
should be in the 110-150 range.  The higher and more even the better. If one 
or two are much lower than the others that is likely your problem. Good luck.  
Hope this helps.  I would not recommend changing anything to do with the 
factory air flow.  The Porsche designers knew a lot about removing heat from 
their engines and every piece was put there for a reason. Jerry Work...
