Hi A.K.,

I replaced my trombone with an Earls cooler similar to the Mocal
last summer.  After building my own brackets, relocating it twice,
adding ducting, etc., I decided the '87 factory cooler w/fan would
have been a much smarter purchase.  While shopping for coolers
I was quoted $750 for a used '87.  Even at 3x the price I'd go with
the factory parts.  If for no other reason than they fit.

If you go the factory cooler route make sure you get the stoneguard.
It's also a duct to force the air through the cooler instead of letting
it sneak around it.  And think about getting your bumper notched by a
bodyshop.  Look under an '85 or later Carrera bumper to see what I mean.

Good luck,
