Good Morning All,

I have an '82 SC with about 140k miles on it. One of the starting
problems I had was related to wet weather. If it rained a lot when I
was at work, I knew the car would not start well. Once, I had to leave
it for hours until the rain quit and then it would start. YUCH!

Well last tuesday night I decided to go after it. I waited till night
fall and armed with a misting device (old windex sprayer full of water)
I decended into the garage.

First I started the car and let it run til the RMP dropped. I turned
out all the garage and outside lights and waited for my eyes to adjust
to the dark. Oh yes, opening the garage doors is highly recommended.

I sprayed water on the coil and distributor area. Sure enough, there it
was. a spark was jumping from the hi voltage wire of the coil to both
control terminals of the coil.

I shut of the engine and examined the area around the hot wire with a
flash lite. There was a great deal of dark colored crud arount the top
of the coil, mostly grease and soot. I cleaned the area with a paper
towel and redid the experiment. SUCCESS, now instead of a steady spark
there was only an occasional jump. To fix this I need to get some
rubber caps for the coil control terminals.

Yesterday, it rained hard all day. NO STARTING PROBLEM, YES!

Hope someone out there finds this helpful
