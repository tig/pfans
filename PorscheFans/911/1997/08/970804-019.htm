The corrosion I found was on the circuit card itself in the vicinity
(memory may be weak at this point) of the power circuits. Solder will
occasionally corrode after time and the salts from the chemicals used in
the manufacturing process will crystalize out. It is difficult to describe,
but the salts appear as whitish crystalline deposits. These can absorb
moisture, bridge circuits, etc.. After I cleaned this off the board, my DME
problems disappeared. I used Radio Shack PC circuit board cleaner in a
spray can. Contact cleaner can be used as well.

Not to buck the Bruce, but a cold solder joint is more of an infant
mortality thing than a problem that appears after many years (as in the
'87). However, a minor cold solder joint (partial) coupled with the
corrosion described above can work together to make problems that are
easily cured with a reflow followed by a good scrubbing with the solvent.


Obligatory warning: a DME can be quite expensive to replace. If you don't
know how to solder, if you are not clear on heatsinking sensitive
components and what can and can't take solvent, I would suggest that you
first get an electronics kit to practice on before going in (the DME).
