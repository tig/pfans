I realize this is not related to the list, but I am looking for some
general information about some cars a friend recently inheirited. My
friends father recently passed away and left him with a bunch of old
British cars, and several other models including a Porsche 924 Turbo in
like new condition. My main question involves the Morgan. Does anyone out
there know much about these cars. We are not even sure what year it is. It
is in excellent original condition. It has been stored in a climate
controlled building for a number of years, possibly 15 years plus. We need
help putting a dollar value on the Morgan and the other cars, too. He wants
to sell everything. Also, when is the British car show in St. Louis? Anyone
in the St. Louis area that can help, please contact me. I know there is the
Morgan, a Mini Cooper, a couple Bugeye's, and some others. I will be going
for a closer inspection tomorrow.
