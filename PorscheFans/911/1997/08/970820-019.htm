Fuel-related deposits on the valves can play havoc with the 
interpretation of leakdown tests. Many people have paid thousands of 
dollars for valve jobs that weren't necessary. 
 Before I would condemn an engine as having leaking valves, I would try
a few bottles of Techron or LubroMoly. Another great alternative is the 
MotorVac treatment. Many out-of-tolerance hydrocarbon problems have been 
successfully resolved using the proper fuel additives. After a few 
tankfulls of treated fuel, do the leakdown tests again. 
  We have had great luck with using these products to solve a myriad of 
compression and drivability problems.
