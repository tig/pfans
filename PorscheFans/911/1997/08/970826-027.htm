hello,

I was talking to my dealer about colored gauge faces and he said that for a
mere(!) $1000 he could have aluminum faces installed on a 993. needless to
say, that seemed a little high.  however, looking through Excellence at the
ads in the back, i found a company that you could mail order faces from (nr
automobile accessories  nrauto.com). anyway, they charge ~$240 (without
installation).  does anybody have colored gauges or any experience with this
(or other) manufacturers?  is the work difficult to do yourself, or better
off leaving it to a good shop?
how about any general ideas/feelings about colored gauges at all. are they a
bad idea? everybody happy with white on black...

thanks
jim
