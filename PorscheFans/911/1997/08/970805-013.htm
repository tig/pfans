some of you don't know what this entails:

First, we need more people than we currently have. Realistically, we need
at least 30-40 people to buy into this to make the cost per shirt
reasonable. BY reasonable, I mean about $15-$20. Less than that, and the
cost per shirt sky rockets. MOre than that and the cost goes down. I got
one suggestion about an emboidered shirt. It's a nice idea, but it would
be expensive to do and the shop I go to would want big $$$$ for
that. If I can get permission t use the Porschefans logo, that's great
because the most expensive thing about this whole endeavor would be if the
shop had to do the artwork. I can print the logo off on my ink jet, take
it to them, and have them reproduce it on the shirts. Something to
consider is color; a single color logo is cheaper than a full color logo.
How much, I'm not sure right now but I'll find out. Also, we;d need to
trim down that top 50 list, say make it a top ten. I guess I can wait til
we have a enough people to pull this off, then have a vote on which ones
to include. So, talk to your fellow list members and get them to contact
me so I can add the to this list. Maybe this will become a reality after
all....>>

Come on everyone... lets get this going.  We have at least 100 people on this
list that would buy a shirt!  Count me in for at least three.
