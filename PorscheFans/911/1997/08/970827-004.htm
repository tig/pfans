I think what Jeff meant was valve ADJUSTMENT, which is when these things
are usually discovered, as the broken stud falls out when the valve
cover is removed. Stud is cheap, repair job is $1000-3000+, depending on
how kind your mechanic is and what else you do while you are in there.
Often, a top-end rebuild at least is recommended, since the stud
probably broke in an SC about that time. Mine broke at 140,000+, so I
decided to do the whole shebang. BTW, for a data point for those who say
"FIX IT IMMEDIATELY! You'll destroy the piston, cylinder, and head!": I
drove mine 2 years, and only had a couple of tiny blemishes on the
cylinder sealing surface, which were easily surfaced away. Of course,
that may have been luck (not likely in my case), and I was careful of
how I drove, not putting much load on it at low RPM or revving TOO high,
etc.

p.s. Just got the engine back and drove it at Rockingham. Ah, it was so
good to do a track event again after all that time! Engine ran great,
with some minor items that need to be taken back, but driver sure could
use some fine tuning!

chains, ramps, etc should have been replaced at the same time valve job
was
done. 

I hope your engine is still on the bench so you can get this fixed. If
not
your mechanic needs to be replaced.
