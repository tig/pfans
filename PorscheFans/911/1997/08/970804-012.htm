Tom,

I noticed deposits on my rotors shortly after putting Pagid orange pads on
my car, but after hard braking at a DEW weekend, they were gone. I suspect
that until the pads are fully bedded, parts of the rotor that are 'low' and
not seeing the full pressure of the pad are retaining material. I did not
notice any problems with brake performance while the deposits were present,
however.
