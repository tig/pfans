I've finally succeeded in adding a tail to my Carrera.  During the installation
process, I found that the rear of the tail covered the tip of the "C" in the
Carrera nameplate on the decklid.  I painstakingly removed the nameplate using
a hair dryer and lots of patience.  The deck lid cleaned up nicely with rubbing
alcohol.

Now I'm ready to stick on the new nameplate.  But the question is where?  Can
somebody with a factory-installed tail please measure and tell me how far up
the deck lid to place the emblem?  My car is an '87 coupe, and tail is factory
Carrera tail.  I need the measurement from say the rear lip of the deck lid
to the bottom of the emblem.

BTW, I now have an excellent grill, and an extra deck lid that is factory
drilled for a tail, but needs paint.  The grill is from my '87 w/ AC and
is concours.  The deck lid is from a '92 RS America, which I think fits most
911's.  If you're thinking of adding a tail (perhaps an aftermarket one) but
don't want to sacrifice your existing deck lid, maybe we can make a deal.
I'm in North CA Bay Area.

Thanks,
