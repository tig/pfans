Moe asks
>hi all,
>can someone explain the exact operation of the "speed switch"
>on a 72 911T w/ MFI?

The RPM sensor outputs 12v whne tthe engine is above 
about 1600 rpm.  This 12v is applied to a solenoid on the 
MFI pump that shuts off thefuel supply to the pump. 
 Between the RPM sensor and the solenoid is a 
microswitch which is open when the accelerator pedal is 
depressed,and closed when your foot is off the accelerator.  
The net effect ofthis 'system' is that the MFI solenoid is 
only activated when above1600 rpm **and** when your 
foot is off the pedal, thus preventing
fuel from being pumped into the engine when coasting at speed.

It sounds like you need to adjust your idle.

>also can i adjust the idle speed @ FI pump without going thru
>the complete setup procedure?

I don't think so.  The adjustments on the pump --there are two--
really only adjust the mixture at idle and partr load.  The one
at idle has virtually no effect on idle speed.  It's supposed
to adjust CO output, but it doesn't have much effect on the
either.

You need to adjust the throttle linkage and the air screws in the
throttle bodies.
