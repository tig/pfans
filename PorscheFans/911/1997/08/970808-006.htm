Bruce Wm. Pigozzi says he has had a cast imitation 993 rim crack.  I had
the singular experience of riding in a 993 at Texas World Speedway
when an aftermarket 993 right rear rim not only cracked, but all 5 spokes
failed, leaving the hub attached to the axle, and the tire and 17" rim on
their own.  Luckily, we were on the  infield section, the rim stayed more
or less put, and beyond a small gouge in the caliper no further harm
appeared to have been done.  Looked to me like the rim was a casting,
and it had been failing for at least a little while, as only one spoke looked
like a more or less instantaneous shear (amateur metallurgical analysis
was hampered by the pounding the fracture faces took as they and we
bounced and banged along the track before coming to a stop).  Driver
was flogging car pretty hard, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I've
subjected my Cookie Cutters to lots worse abuse.

These spokes were pretty beefy, so perhaps whoever made the wheel
wasn't just doing what happened early on with the early American
Racing Wheel copy of the Fuchs:  A cast copy with same dimensions as
the forged wheel and no reinforcement to account for the strength
difference.  Or maybe they were, as I can't say I know what the
crossection of a factory 993 spoke looks like.

I looked for a manufacturer's name on the rim.  All I recognized was
"Made in Italy."  The owner didn't say what brand they were, just that he
was planning to take them back to the seller.

A question for the list:  If a rim is TUV approved (German Technische
Ueberpruefungs Verband with reported strict strength standards, and
the approval we are always urged to require of our wheels), how does
one know it?  Are the letters TUV stamped or cast into the inside of the
rim?  Is some sort of stylized TUV logo similarly applied, but hard to
recognize as TUV?  Can you go to some TUV website and read it auf
Deutsch as best one can?  Have to rely on dealers who tell you of
course it is TUV approved, you don't think I would sell anything that
wasn't?
