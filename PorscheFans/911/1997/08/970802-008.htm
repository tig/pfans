One problem a lot of people seem to have (myself included) is that the =
inside of the lenses get cloudy, which give them that dim yellow look.  =
I cleaned mine through the back with a paper towel soaked in glass =

around the inside.

Still, I agree with Pete, the lense design seems poor.  I went with the =
brighter bulbs too, but I wasn't that impressed.  BTW, someone recently =
was asking about some $25 bulbs from Performance Products.  If you want =
the brighter H5 bulbs, I think you'll find Imparts has the best prices.  =
About $12.
