Rather than rushing, I took my time bleeding my brakes recently and did
a thorough novice inspection of the brakes.  Now I'm concerned and a
little uncertain.  Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

The car has Cool Carbon brake pads, installed about ten months ago.  The
car is typically used by two drivers at one autocross and one time trial
per month.

LEFT FRONT  ("S" Calipers)
1)  It clicks loudly on each pump of the brakes (most of the time, but
not always).  It sounds like the cylinder is sticking and suddenly frees
itself, hitting the pad/disc.
2)  There was a light layer of rust on the outside of the disc, about
half the width of the pad.  Easy to wipe off, but obviously the brake
pad is fully not rubbing the disc.
3)  Brake pads were worn to 8/32" outside and 12/32" inside.
4)  Recently I have had trouble bleeding the left front, the bubbles get
smaller but never seem to end.

RIGHT FRONT ("S" Calipers)
1)  All looked fine.  Each pad was worn to 12/32".

LEFT REAR ("M" Calipers(?))
1)  The pads were worn unevenly across 2 directions (front to back and
top to bottom).
2)  The outside pad had two corners worn to 6/32", one corner worn to
8/32 inch and one corner worn to 3/32".  The inside pad had two corners
worn to 8/32", one corner worn to 10/32 inch and one corner worn to
6/32".  The corresponding/adjacent corner of each pad was worn the most.
3)  When the pad are placed together, there is about 1/2 - 3/4 inch
difference between the combined thickness of the widest and narrowest
corners!

RIGHT REAR ("M" Calipers(?))
1)  The inside pad was worn to 2/32" while the outside pad was worn to
only 9/32".

NOTE:  The discs looked fine on all four wheels; some small, smooth
ridges but the surfaces looked parallel.

My questions:
1)  What would cause the clicking on the left front?  If it is a
sticking/freeing cylinder, then why the rust on this disc?
2)  What in the world is happening at the left rear?
3)  What is happening at the right rear?
4)  Will the simple caliper rebuild kits solve these problems?
5)  The factory workshop manual says "The brake calipers may be
disassembled only when the O-rings between the caliper halves should
develop a leak."  Does this only refer to separating the caliper halves
and doesn't not apply to these caliper rebuild kits?
6)  What is the reason for the 20 degree piston alignment tool mentioned
in the factory manual?  Do I need to be concerned about this, or can I
align it by sight?
