My '88 Coupe is completely stock and came with 15" Fuchs.  16" Fuchs
were an option in '88.

Hi Rick,


From what you describe below, are you sure it's an '87 or '88 911? Those
wheel and tire combos sound as if they came from an early Porsche. Also,
an '87 or '88 911 shouldn't be rusting so soon. I think you should check
the vin numbers on the windshield, in the trunk and the door post before
going any further. It just sounds a little fishy to me. I remember some
Porschefan several months ago drove several hours to see a car only to
realize that the '84 911 he was supposed to be looking at was actually
an early '70s car that had been "fixed up". I hope I'm wrong, but I
would stay away from an late '80s car if it had rust, especially since
they are supposed to be fully galvanized.
