I took a co-worker's '86 911 Turbo for a spin today at lunch.  Holy cow, 
what a lot of work!  The clutch was much stiffer and had a shorter travel 
than my '97 993, the shifter was loose in neutral and difficult to find one 
gear from another (unless you were used to it, I suppose), and the 
unassisted steering was soooo heavy, you could really feel the 
understeering at the turn-in point.  I had always heard that 911's 
understeered initially in a turn, but I guess the power-assist on the 993 
steering alleviate a lot of it.

I don't mean to disrespect the earlier 911's or start a flame war, but I 
had no idea that driving the earlier 911's could be so different than 
driving my 993.  It being my first P-car, I suppose I'm somewhat spoiled by 
all the lux touches, but now I know what it means when they say that the 
Porsche 911 is a "real driver's car".  (And I can only imagine what it's 
like at the limit before the redesigned rear suspension!)  I now have a 
greater sense of respect for older Porsche drivers (and drivers of older 
Porsche as well <grin>).

When did they include power steering, anyway?
