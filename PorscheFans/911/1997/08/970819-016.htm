My opinion:  

Porsche models are essentially reflective of their powerplant, so
this is, if anything, a 911E.

Figure there is TEN TIMES the rust that you can't see . . . 
If this were a decent "frame" reconstruction, don't you think they
should have dealt with the rust then?    Rusty cars are JUNK in
my book.   They are to be forever suspect structurally, and are
an unending money pit financially.

A normal 911 engine will puff smoke for a couple of seconds at startup.  If
it persists all the way through warmup, you have a soft engine (rings, 
cylinder wear, valve guides).

 The tailpipe was black inside. 
>The mechanic said he had been working to adjust the carbs.

Uhh . . . er. . .  anything more?   There isn't much adjustment.   He could
change the jets, but otherwise the only adjustment is at idle.

Just don't hold it up to the light . . . 


 Question is:  Do frame
>up construction distract from the value of the car?

Probably not, IF WELL DONE, including corrosion control.   If, however,
corrosion control was NOT done, then MORE damage might have been
done by opening the frame to later corrosion.

  Would an E-type
>engine in an S-type body reduce the value.

As mentioned above, the car is an E, not an S.    The bodies are otherwise
virtually identical.

Assuming the rust can be
>cleaned up reasonably

It canNOT be done "reasonably".

 approx. value of such a machine.  

The car is either a boat anchor or a parts source.   Find a better one.

Frankly,

Dave
