I have a '82 SC with about 144Kmi. The symptoms on hot start were
simple; it did not want to start at all. Sometime it would, but under
great duress.

Cold starting (air temp 60's) was ok. But, a few seconds after start
the engine rpm would start to drop and I would have to coax it back
into running smooth. Warm running was fine.

I replace the warm up regulator with a rebuilt one, no real
improvement. I had expected some improvement in the cold start but none
occured.

The answer was in the fuel mixture. It was set WAY to lean. This
adjusted, the cold start is smooth, engine running is much smoother,
and hot start is better. In a typical hot start situation, warm engine
left in the parking lot for 30min to 4hrs, it car will start mostly on
the second crank.

We'll have to wait for colder weather to see if the 7th injector is
working or not.

Thanks to all who responded to my pleas. This is what makes this list
great.
