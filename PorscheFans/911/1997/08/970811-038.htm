The Webers seemed to be hesitating a little in second and third under
heavy acceleration, so with the last tank of gas I added a pint of
Chevron Techron, having read nothing but good about it as a fuel
additive. I got about 2 miles from the service station when the car
began to hesitate badly. I scarcely made it up the hill and about two
blocks from home when the car died. Tremendous amounts of blue smoke
coming out of the exhaust. Same when I tried to restart. Pushed the car
home and into the garage, where I am now siphoning thew crap out of the
tank, and plan to refill with clean, techron-free gas.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Any advice? Other than have it
towed to the Wrench for a complete tank, fuel line, fuel pump, and Weber
cleaning?

TIA for any good advice. Maybe even mediocre advice.

Luther
