I'm having a problem with the 911 list, that I can't seem to resolve, and am
hoping  one of you  has a solution.

I like to receive my digests at one e-mail address, and send
my posting sfrom another.  It's a long story.  Don't ask.

I used to be able to do it, but recently it has become impossible.
 Apparently, only those who subscribe to the
List are allowed to post to it.  If you try to post with another
e-mail address you receive an automated message from
the List daying you are not authorized to post to it.

I've sent several messages to the Listmaster about this, but
have received no response.  I know he's busy, and will get to
it, but in the meantime, if someone knows a way around this,
I'd appreciate knowing too.

Many thanks.

spindels@aol.com - where I receive digests, and can post as well
