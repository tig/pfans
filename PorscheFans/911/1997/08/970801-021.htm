A few days ago Steve asked about shock abosorbers.  I'm just
now catching up.


Hi Steve,

>recommendations?

Shocks are like tires and oil.  There are an almost unlimited number
of opinions and passions.  You should have seen the raging debates on
Porschefans predecessor, Porschephiles.

For what it's worth, I have new Sport Bilsteins on one of my '72 911's, and
much cheaper KYB's on my other.  I don't think the Bilsteins are harsh at
all.  They're very comfortable for highway and around town driving. I'd
actually like them to be a bit stiffer.

On the other hand, the KYB's are stiff.  Real stiff.  I happen to like
that, but I think most people would consider them too harsh for the road.

It doesn't take a 'pro'.  You need to remove the  nut holding
the top of shock.  With the wheel off, you can then push
the strut down far enough for it to clear the fender and swing outwards,
whereupon you can remove the shock..

>Where are the best deals for shocks?

I like RD Enterprises (800) 683 2890.  Their prices are as good or better
than
anyone's, and their service is outstanding.  I've been satisfied and
impressed.
(No relationship, etc., etc.  Just a happy customer.)
