Dear 911 enthusiasts


Many thanks to all those who responded to my query about buying a 911SC.

I must say I recieved a healthy response from my first message to the =
list - lots of messages to read all of which I enjoyed no end. You have =
put my mind at rest about buying an 'old' car.

Some of them were very informative and will be kept for future =
reference. I shall enjoy seeking out an 83 SC armed with this knowledge:

"Hey, have those chain tensioners been updated or what?" etc.

 I was driving around Perth here 'down under' and I saw three SC's all =
of which would have been suitable. Mind you, the sun is very harsh here =
so I might not go for a targa...

I also pulled up behind a very meaty looking and fairly new 928. I guess =
you 911 purists would dismiss this monster as not being a real =
Porsche???


Many thanks again, and certainly and more comments would be most welcome
