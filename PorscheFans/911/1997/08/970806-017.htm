Neil,

It's been years since I had a distributor on my '72, but I believe you
have vacuum retard on a stock S distributor in '73.  I think it is
mainly for emissions control and only retards about 5 deg at idle.  Make
sure the vacuum line is plugged going to the motor -- you don't really
need it.  Perhaps your points have lost their setting (not tight enough
when set) or the distributor shaft is worn enough to cause a fluctuation
in dwell.  Tell us a bit more about how it runs, 'cause it could be
something else entirely....
