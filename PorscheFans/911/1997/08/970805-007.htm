<<I'm not a proponent of installing amps and all of the nifty gadgets, in
fact, I would
rather have no radio and enjoy the sound of the car on spirited drives in the
country.>>

But some people do like to stretch the performance envelope on their stereo
as well, especially in a 911. For those that are interested, Car Audio and
Electronics magazine has featured two Porsches with competition-level (IASCA
sound-off champions) systems in the last three issues.  In the current August
issue there is a system featured that was rated 4th best in the nation at a
recent invitational meet while the the June issue, available as a back issue,
shows a great installation in a late '80s 911 with exceptional attention to
detail.  If interested, E-mail me with your fax number and I can fax you a
copy of the June article as I have done for several others who have asked.
 The August issue, which has a new 1997 Vette on the cover, is available on
newsstands so you can scan it in 4-color glory there.

<<I'm satisfied with the sound and plan to keep the Reno to make it as
'original' as possible.>>

It is possible to have great soundand keep your car original.  Currently, we
are working on a story for an upcoming issue on stealth or non-invasive
installattion techniques.  If you have a Porsche that falls into this
category, please drop me a note.  We are especially looking for high
performance systems that give no outward indication of what is hidden.

Thanks,
