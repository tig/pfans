Scott,
There is a nylon (or some other plastic) steering column bushing
about 3 inched down into the column from the steering wheel.
It is common for this steering column bushing to disintegrate and
fall apart.  When that happens, the steering wheel becomes loose
(up/down/side-to-side) and you'll notice it when going over bumps
and other jarring terrain.
 
Theoretically the repair is simple.  The factory nylon bushing
is cheap (approx. $20, although that much for a $0.20 material
cost is outrageous).  However, the factory bushing needs to be
inserted from the far end of the steering column.  This results
in a 6 hour remove/reinstall of the column...etc.  
 
Performance and Automotion (and others, I'm sure) sell an
aftermarket replacement bushing which slips in from the top
(steering wheel side) of the steering column.  This is MUCH
easier, quicker and I don't see any significant problems
with this approach.  It means that the old bushing pieces
will be left in the column, but they shouldn't be a problem.
This repair takes about 20 minutes, one tool (big socket),
and one part ($20 bushing).  To me it's worth the compromise.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
