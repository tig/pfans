Brad:

I don't know whether this is what you were thinking of... It's a 
message I posted back in March:

------- Forwarded Message Follows ------

To remove the existing rust, go to your local auto-parts store and get
a "Nick-Sander"... It's a pen-shaped tool with a tip made of glass
filaments, made by a company called "NicSand".  3M makes a nearly
identical tool; I don't know the name offhand.

While you're there, get a 3M "Rust Avenger"; it's also pen-shaped, and
it dispenses a rust-eliminating primer through the tip.

Use the glass-filament pen to clean out the chip, then apply primer
with the Rust Avenger pen.  Wait for the primer to dry, then start
applying touch-up paint.

I say "START applying" because you'll want to apply it in a series of
thin layers, waiting for each to dry before applying the next. If the
applicator that came with your touch-up paint is too large, use a
needle.

Build the paint up, layer upon layer, until it's just above the 
surface of the surrounding paint.

Wait for the final layer to dry, then take two strips of scotch tape 
and place one on each side of the paint-lump that you've built up.  
Rest a razor blade on the tape and use it to shave your repair down.

Remove the tape and your repair will be just slightly higher (by the
thickness of a piece of scotch tape) than the surrounding paint.  

Sand it down carefully -- use a sanding block, NOT just your fingers
-- until it's flush with the surrounding paint, then polish and wax
it.  You're done.

------- End of Forwarded Message ------

Touch-up paint can be purchased from your Porsche dealer; the other 
supplies can all be found at a well-stocked auto-parts store or any
automotive paint-supply shop.

One item I left out of my original message:  Make sure the chip and
the area around it is CLEAN before you start painting; if you've put
wax or any silicone-containing products over the chip, the primer
and paint may not adhere real well.  The auto-paint suppliers all
sell solvents for stripping that stuff off your paint... If you use
one of them, read the directions and take it off QUICKLY after
applying it; if you leave it on too long, it can start to eat the
paint.
