Hi from the True North,

For those who don't yet know me, my name is Jonathan.

A little over a year ago I sold my 1970 911t factory mod. lightweight to =
a gentleman who seemed on the up and up at the time. I was however a =
little concerned when he insisted on paying me in $100.00 US bills (not =
our regular funny money or certified cheque). But, wanting to sell I =
went ahead and the bills seemed to check out (so far as I know... I =
haven't had any RCMP knocking down my door yet?)

This summer I purchased a winter driver 1987 944 and went to re-register =
the plates only to find out that the guy who bought my 911 still had =
that car registered under my name AND plates !!??!! Thus legally making =
me libel in case of accident or death.

If anyone comes across a 1970 911t Euro with factory modifications VIN# =
9110123930 please contact me immediately at JARNOLD@fzsi.com.

Thanks

.
