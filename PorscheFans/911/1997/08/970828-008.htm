#1 is normal. That gauge should only be observed when the car is warmed
up and sitting still on a level surface. Even then, don't trust it - the
dipstick is the only reliable measurement, to be checked with engine
running in the same conditions as above (especially sitting still!).

#2 could be do to a thorough brake bleeding/flushing. Try disconnecting
the battery for 30 seconds - 1 minute and see if it goes out. If so, you
should be fine.

#1- My oil level gauge fluctuates wildly, falling to the top of the red
zone on
acceleration, but rising to normal (center gauge level) while stopped.
As the engine
warms up, the situation improves somewhat. I'll check the oil, engine
warm and idling,
and I get a good reading on the dipstick. I'm not experiencing excessive
oil consuption, 
and I don't have any leaks. Is this normal? By the way, oil pressure
appears normal
(according to comments on this list) at appx. 1.5 bar per 1,000 RPM.
 
#2- The center-dash brake warning light is on all the time. I didn't
have this problem
when I bought the car. I checked the handbrake switch adjustment and it
appears okay. I
noticed that the PO had a spare Seatbelt/Brake light module laying in
the glove box. I
plan on tracing the problem down this weekend. Where should I start?
Could my two
problems be related?
