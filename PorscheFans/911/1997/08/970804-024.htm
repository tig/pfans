I had this exact same problem with Pagid Orange pads on my 1981 SC.

After about 6-8 fast laps the car was undriveable, as you say.
Switching pads immediately solved the problem, which leads me to believe
the problem was on the pad itsself, rather than the rotor.  Never used
the (expensive) pads again; better wear, stopping and $ from Mintex
pads.
