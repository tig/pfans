I don't know the answer to your question.  I am not aware that the factory
installed AC in 72.  I thought these were dealer or after-market units.  I
am in the process of installing air on my 1970.  My previous experience
with air cooled engines and air conditioning was my 72 super-beetle.  I had
cold air, and no engine cooling problems on the bug.  Used the stock oil
cooler.  Installed an oil temp gage just to keep an eye on things.  Never
saw higher than 210 F oil on the hottest days.  Oil gage was calibrated
using boiling water, and was in good calibration.

Air flow, and air temperature are the most important things for keeping any
car cool.  The condensor under the rear deck is bad on both counts.  I have
seen band-saw work on the engine sheet metal that left gaps around the AC
mounting bracket.  I have seen similar butchering around pressure-fed
tensioners retrofits.  Hot air off the red-hot exhaust system enters the
engine bay, and cooks the engine.  This is a problem driving in stop and go
traffic, when a large percentage of the cooling air enters through those
gaps.  Remember, the sheet metal and seals around the engine are part of
the cooling system, and must be maintained as near leak-tight as possible.

I am not using a condensor under the rear deck on my AC installation.  I am
using the trunk-mounted unit fed with an electric blower.  I am fitting
grills in the now-unused driving light holes in the bumper, and setting up
baffles so that road draft will draw air across a second large condensor
located behind the bumper.  I am expecting ice cold air, and no engine
cooling problems.  The oil cooler should not be needed in your case
provided you take similar care of engine cooling.  The oil cooler will be
limited help if you do not ensure engine cooling.  You will still cook the
cylinder heads and cylinders.

Good luck with your system.  You using R12 or R134a.  R12 is about 30% more
efficient as a refrigerant, but getting expensive and hard to find. 
Considering that the early Porsche is already marginal for driving AC, it
seems a shame to give away another 30%.  I am paying up for R12, and taking
extra precautions to make sure it does not leak: new Sanden 507 compressor,
and barrier hoses.  Also carefully leak-checking all connections.
