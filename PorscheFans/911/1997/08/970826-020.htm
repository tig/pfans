A 911 in snow is lots of fun,  plenty of understeer when you try to
turn, and plenty of oversteer when you step on the gas.  Heater will
melt sand into glass going up to Eisenhower tunnel, coming down you
might be able to keep the windshield from fogging if you hold your
breath.  ;-o
Seriously,   if you stay on the front range and get good tires, like
Blizzaks or similar,  you won't have any problems 98% of the time.  I
find myself adjusting the heat control every I start up a hill or down
the other side, on the plus side you get heat much sooner than from a
water cooled car.  Plan on getting a car bra of some type and clear film
headlight covers or the sand blasting you get will make you cry.  I have
a set of cable type tire chains and fortunately have not had to use them
for many years.
