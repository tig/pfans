I think the G50 transmission introduced in 1987 was the turning point
for 911 trannies. With the G50 we got a full-cone synchromesh,
synchromesh in reverse, shift rods in roller bearings instead of sliding
bearings, shift gate inside transmission, and tons of reinforcements. My
experience in driving different era 911s is that the previous "915" type
transmission just feels looser than the G50.

The 993 got the G50/21 which is even better, but only incrementally. The
additional dual-cone synhronizers for 1st & 2nd gears made shifting even
smoother. The G50/21 is 6 speed (I am not 100% sure if all 933s are 6
speed, are they?).
