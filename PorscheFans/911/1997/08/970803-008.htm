I recently purchased a 91--911 turbo and I am noticing some sort of 
vibration or shaking feeling when backing up and sometime's when I 
round a corner quickly I can also feel it..I was told by the previous 
owner that he had this checked out,and was told by the dealer that 
this was normal and that it was coming from the limited slip rear..I 
also had the car checked out at the dealer and they did not mention 
anything about it either when I had the car inspected for purchase..
This is my first Porsche and I don't have a clue as to whether this 
is normal for this car or not..I would appreciate any help on this..
