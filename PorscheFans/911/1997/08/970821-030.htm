PFans:

I have a 1983 911SC with 65,000 miles that I enjoy as a daily driver (when 
the weather cooperates, of course).  It has been extremely reliable during 
the 3 1/2 years I have owned it.  I believe that the SC models' reputation 
for reliability is due in good part to evolutionary development and an 
understressed engine.

I must say ,though, that I am a little concerned about the longevity of the 
original CD ignition system in my P-Car even though it has given me no 
reason to be so.  Perhaps it is the failure mode of such devices: 
absolutely no warning given before becoming totally inoperable.  I also 
realize that there are other pieces of equipment in any car that fail thus.

Are my fears unfounded?  I hope.  But in any event, I welcome input 
concerning the original units and aftermarket alternatives (Permatune, 
Jacobs, et. al.).   I can't say I believe all the added horsepower claims 
made for these products but really this matters little.  I just want a good,
 reliable system to light the fire in the ol' flat six.

Thanks!
Steve
