My 1971 911S began running badly after I installed two 4 inch SuperTrapp
mufflers.  The car is used for local autocrosses and time trials were I
saw several cars with similar setups.  However, my car loses power
between 3,500 and 5,000 rpm so badly that it almost stumbles.  It seems
strong below 3,500 and it seems noticeably better than stock between
5,000 and the 7,200 redline.

Performance is "best" with no discs installed or with 12 discs in each
muffler; however, the loss of power is still very noticeable in the
mid-rpm band.  The effect is exaggerated as the number of discs
decreases.  With only 3 discs installed in each muffler, the car
stumbles so bad that it won't make it through 5,000 rpms.

The only other time the car has acted like this is when I put on a
friend's excess Brusch muffler (from an E or T).  The Brusch muffler was
very old and the pipe was about 1/8-1/4 inch narrower inside diameter
than my original.  I concluded it was choking my engine and put the
stock muffler back on the car.

What am I missing?  Since timings from 20-90 mph got progressively worse
as I added discs, it seems to me that the engine is being choked -- but
this doesn't make sense with this free flowing exhaust.  Does the
mechanical fuel injection need to be adjusted now that the exhaust flows
better?  Any suggestions?  

Still fairly new at this, but loving it:
