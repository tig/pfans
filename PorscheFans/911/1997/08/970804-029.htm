Mike,

>anyway? Who makes or sells the best replacement part?

I'm going through this now, too.  Real fun to get one off.  If the 
other isn't broken, and has been updated, leave it alone (mine was). 
OTOH, if the other is not broken and its just the old "L" style 
bracket, its yours/your mechanics call.  The factory replacement part 
has been improved by additional metal and its been around for several 
years, someone told me.  Kinda makes a triangle out of the braket like 


                        l
so:                     l
                       ll
                      l l
                     l  l
                    l   l
                 llllllll

Anyway, good luck.  If you wanna remove the old one yourself bring 
chisels, grind stones, vise grips and something I thought worked great  
which was a small carbide rotary drill tip; like a 1/2" circular saw 
mounted to the tip of a bit.  Air would've been nice, but I bet most of 
us don't have that.
