Chris, 

Concerning your former post to the group about removing your whale tail to
clean the inside of the deck lid, I am also in a similar position.  I have
a dark blue 87 coupe that needs the same treatment.  The screen on the top
of the tail is reminiscent of 'chicken wire', however, I have seen most
club members with a smaller and cleaner looking mesh and also a double
louver set up underneath the external one.

I'm thinking there were two different types of tails made (mine is a
factory original) and the screening was either the large size or the small
size with two louvers (this prevents you from seeing any dirt inside the
tail end).

I don't think I can update the screen and louver assembly that easily since
the 'chicken wire' on my wing appears to be riveted onto the tail body some
how.  Both rubber lip and fiberglass tail are factory items, but don't look
as a nice as others in the club.

Can anyone offer any input to this difference in appearance?  Can I
purchase the internal louver and install it onto my existing wing w/o
removing the riveted screen that comes with it?

Thanks

Jo
