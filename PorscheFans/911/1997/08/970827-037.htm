Interesting -- I just did this, this last weekend.  It is not that hard if you
know what to do (and what not, which I learned :-).

You do have to uncover the steering area (remove the gravel plate, it's called)
under the steering rack, remove the rack bolts, loosen a coupling bolt accessed
from the front trunk, and pry the spacers in there.  It takes some wiggling
around to get the spacers, and the rack, properly centered.

Afterwards you must adjust toe because raising the height of the steering rack
will have added negative toe (toe in).  Of course you need to tighten the
steering coupling under the trunk too.  Some of these bolts have relatively
small torques so should be carefully tightened.

The point of warning I have after doing this: do everything with the front
jacked including putting it all back together.  Do not let the car down in
between removing the gravel plate and putting it back on.  Why?  The 2 hex
bolts holding the back of the gravel plate also happen to be one of two bolts
on each side holding the front sway bar mounts to the body.  If you let the car
down, the sway bar will twist, the brackets holding the sway bar to the mounts
on the body will pop out of the mounts, and the sway bar will move slightly in
the bushings at their ends (A-arm mounts).  Nothing breaks, but it is a HUGE
PAIN to get the whole assembly back together.  I think all this can be avoided
if you do not stress the sway bar while the hex bolts are out.  Toe is easily
adjusted with the car down, so that can be done after everything is put back
together.

The improvement in bump steer was very apparent.  My car is lowered by roughly
1.25" in the front and had quite a bit of bump steer.  It is now very difficult
to detect any.  I used the 10mm high Weltmeister spacers available from
Automotion.
