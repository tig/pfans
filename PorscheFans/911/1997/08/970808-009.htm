Walter:

TUV-approved wheels are probably (but not necessarily) stamped with 
the triangular TUV logo.  The letters "TUV" may appear below the 
triangle.

However...

There's a large number of products (including wheels) being sold 
with forged TUV certifications.  Most of these products are made in 
China (no matter what the label says), and the quality is usually 
awful.

TUV offers a service to verify the authenticity of any Certificate; 
you can use the service by contacting TUV through any of the 
following:

    tel:  +49 221 806-1371
    fax:  +49 221 806-3909
    e-mail:  verification@tuv.com

They'll probably want to know the TUV Certificate number, the
manufacturer's name, and the product model name or number; you can
get all that information from the wheel distributor. 

Good luck...

-Andy

P.S.  And for anyone who's considering the purchase of aftermarket
      wheels, it'd be a good idea to get the TUV number, etc., from
      the seller BEFORE you purchase, so you can verify the veracity
      of any "TUV-approved" claims.
