Coleman,
  Just in case it's not common knowledge, let me share a "gotcha"
that happened to me last time I did this. I discovered that
when I pushed the pistons well back into the calipers and then 
put the new pads in that the brake pedal would go half way to the floor
before it firmed up. No amount of bleeding or pushing the pedal helped.
  On a hunch, I removed the brake pads one pad at a time and pushed
the piston out most of the way (by stepping on the brake pedal)
and then pushed the piston back into the caliper just enough to
get the new pad in. This fixed things.  
  My _theory_ is that when I pushed the piston way back in the caliper 
I  moved the seal. As I understand (?) it, the seal sort of stays 
in one place and flexes to let the piston move out. In its "relaxed" 
state it pulls the piston back a little. Before I fixed the problem 
the piston was pulled too far back from the disk so I had to take up 
all that free play before the pads would make contact with the disk.

 Chris
  
P.S. PFans please feel free to correct me or shed more light on the 
  subject.
