James O Stephenson asks:

"Probably a dumb question, but does anybody know exactly when a BF
Goodrich tire is worn out enough to not use again? . . . Can I still use
them safely, or should I replace them before any
additional track event?"

I'll venture a dumb answer, assuming these are Comp TA R-1s, and that
they haven't been flat-spotted:

They are fine until the cord just starts to show somewhere, and then
they are junk.  

In fact, they may be better as they get less and less tread: like slicks, the
lack of tread blocks means less tread squirm, and thinner tread squirms
less.  Paper thin thread won't, of course, last long.  

BFG seems to use the same rubber down to the cord, or it did a few
years ago.  Yoko seemed to have their tread rubber on top of a harder
rubber covering the cord.  The Goodyear slicks I run now are that way. 
In any event, if you are a reasonably experienced driver you should be
able on a track to determine when you have worn through to the cord,
the steel belting, or the hard stuff:  If in front, you will get a big push.  If in
rear, it will get loose.  Also, you may well experience braking lockup
when it shouldn't happen, though this is tricky on the front if you do a lot
of trail braking.  The experience part involves knowing what you should
more or less be able to do in a particular corner from past experience.  
Plus you need to remember which tire or tires are suspect, so that you
will not let self-delusional thinking run rampant (the track was just
greasy, maybe someone oiled that corner, etc).

In addition, prudence dictates that you check the tires at every
opportunity by jacking up the car and turning the tire so you can inspect
all of it, so you don't have to rely upon feeling it get to the cord to tell you
when it is the end of the line.   I don't go out with even the smallest patch
of cord showing.  You can run on a little bit of cord for a while without
really noticing it.  On the other hand, if you push it too long on the cord,
especially well after noticing some change even though you can
compensate,  you may find the car will push or spin off the track, with a
hole in the carcas you can put your fist through (you can imagine how I
acquired this knowledge, but it was a private test and tune).  Some
tracks are more forgiving than others.  

Then again, I'm at the trailering stage (evolved from towing a trailer
behind the 911 to towing the 911 on a trailer), and have 8-12 track tires
available.  If I were driving on my R-1s to the event with no spares I
couldn't use the "wear it out" philosophy.

Most PCA regions (and other venues, for that matter) have tire wear
rules, which typically purport to forbid cutting things this close.  The
PCRs, for instance, require that tire tread be measurable in two locations
within the tread groves on the circumference approx. 180 degrees apart,
and say that cord may not be visible before, during, or after runs.  (The
during part is kind of an interesting rule to apply, if you think about it).  
Your fellow drivers may not be as confident you won't somehow take
them along with you into disaster as you may be, or may feel that if you
wad your car up into a ball and die it will discourage others from
participating and generally will make everyone feel badly, even if you
don't mind.  Of course, you wouldn't run a suspect tire in an actual wheel
to wheel race - at that level of commitment you've got some good rubber
in reserve for qualifying and the race.  But tires are expensive, and it is
hard to toss them while there is still a drop of use left for practice.
