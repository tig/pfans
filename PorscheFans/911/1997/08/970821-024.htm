For street or occasional autox 195 or 205/60/15 is a good compromise.

So far nobody has won (or even run?) a major event on the new Yokos.

Two of the fastest stock 911 drivers in the country have 
independantly tried the BFG 225/50/15 R1 on stock 6" rims this
year. I tried this because the top Neons (6x14" wheels) are
running 225/50/14 tires in the front and going WAY TOO FAST.

The 225 seems to work well although the contact area
is probably no greater than the 205 due to bowing of the tire.
I don't think it is substantially faster than the 205/15 on a 6"
rim but it's not slower either (except in the wet).

Only BFG's 225 R1 will work on a 6" rim, other brands do not
have the same type of sidewall design and will not work well.
The 225 WILL work better on 7 or 8" wide rims if you can use them.
They will JUST fit under the rear fenders of a ''69-'77 911
on stock 1 7/8" offset 6" rims, or 7 or 8" rims with the same offset as
the 6" rims. Front should not be a problem. (Why did Porsche
design the early 911 to allow bigger tires in front??!!??).
