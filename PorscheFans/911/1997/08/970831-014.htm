My PO had the car, an '87 Carrera, lowered ~9 years ago, and due to
original lowering work or sagging over the years, the rear was lowered by
nearly 2" (the front about 1.25") from spec.  No other changes to the
suspension were made aside from alignment.

I am in the process of raising the rear, balancing, etc.  Looks good
overall.  I thought I'd try measuring the suspension travel in the rear
(which was lowered so much) by manually compressing the shock while I had
it off the control arm until it bumped, measuring how far the lower (inner)
tube stuck down from the lip of the upper (enclosing) tube -- 7.5" -- then
measuring again when it was all put back together and driven: 8.75".  That
would seem to mean the total suspension travel to the bump is 1.25".  This
seems rather low for a stock suspension, doesn't it?  (And, only 0.5"
travel before I raised it!!)

Any ideas what the travel should be for a stock suspension, at least for
the compression stroke?  I definitely drive it spiritedly so would like the
appropriate travel for good handling in turns.  A suspension upgrade in not
in the near future...

To give some background on current suspension settings, the fender lip
measurements in the rear are now 24-3/4" (Bruce A's recommendation in his
book is 25" for the rear), and the official service manual method (offset
between centers of axle and torsion bars) is about 22 mm (spec is 12 mm; a
higher number means a lower car) and Bruce says up to 1-1/4" works well (31
mm) but the discussion of this value is limited to suspension geometry, not
necessary travel limitations with stock suspension.

Thanks for any help,

        -Mike
