When I had my '84 Turbo-Look, changed oil & filter at 6000 miles with either
Castrol Syntec then (later) Mobil-1.  Car was tracked (5-8 times/yr), 
autocrossed, and driven hard for the 135,000 miles I had it.  I had a 
leakdown test done at request of now owner, all cylinders reading approx. 
5% leakdown.  Had to take cylinder head off to repair a snapped spark
plug (nobody could tell me why it froze: these were replaced every 15,000
miles, as well as valves adjusted), shop said exhaust valve guides were 
starting to approach wear limits, bottom end was great.

I am going with the same intervals on my 993; I don't care what the factory
says about 15,000 miles being OK.

I did my own work, so always was below $100.

I have an 85 911. I've been to three mechanics and each one has given me
different answers regarding service intervals. I change the oil every
3-5,000 no matter what, but I want to know about the bigger services.

One answer I got was a major one every 7,500 miles, another answer every
11,000, and the third guy thought every 15,000. I also found that prices
in the Bay Area also vary quite a bit. I got quotes from $450 to $800 for
the same service...

What gives? Has anyone had similar experiences?

thanks in advance,

S
