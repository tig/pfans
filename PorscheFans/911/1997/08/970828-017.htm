I have a 87 911 turbo which I pretty much drive everyday.  So far the
car has 75,000 miles.  In order to drive it everyday modifications
should be made to get rid of the turbo lag.  It is a problem for initial
acceleration up entrance ramps and traffic merging.  Un like Calif in NJ
the roads do not give you much room to merge.  My Subaru is quaicker
off  the line, but once you get up to 3500rpm you are in business.  I
made the following modifications to take care of the problem.  Headers
and muffler had to keep the cat because in  NJ they take a mirror an
check for the cat.  I also put on  a lightweight clutch.  This took care
of the turbo lag, cost about $3500.  Now it is fun to drive dailey. 
Dunlops D40M2 have 30,000 miles with plenty of tread left. Because you
are driving it everyday maintenance costs are increased only because of
the increased miles.  If you let a car sit it develops significant oil
leaks according to Powertech who specialize in turbos because the seals
dry up and leak if you do not drive it.  Buying a 87 turbo with 10,000
miles will have significant oil leaks this should be checked not just
the oil tubes but the engine itself.  Replace all seals costs about
$2500.  Good luck
