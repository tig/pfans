Re Brian Henry's question about whether to buy a car that has had its
color changed, my answer would be that if you can tell, you shouldn't
buy it.  Certainly it's worth less.  Granted, some people don't care
about these things, but if those who do are turned off, that decreases
demand and hence value.

I've weighed in on this on the old Porschephiles list, so it's an old
story, and not everybody will agree with me.  But unless a
color-change is done *completely*, and I mean *completely*, there will
always be telltale signs.  A paint chip will show the old color.
Replacing front or rear glass will cause chips showing the old color.
If the engine isn't removed, there will be the old color in the engine
compartment.  Pull up the rugs and you'll see the old color. The list
goes on and on.  Now if you have a really good deal going, and it
doesn't matter to you, the decrease in value can work to your
advantage.

I changed color on the first car I owned and always regretted it.  If
you're doing a ground-up restoration and starting with a body shell,
well, that's another story.

Just my two cents, FWIW.  --Steve Gilbert
