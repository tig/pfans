They could be original Fuchs.  The easiest way to tell is
to remove them and look for a Porsche part number stamped
on the back.  Or the Fuchs emblem (a little fox in a
triangular border)

I can almost guarantee the polished or chrome finish is
not original.  Most Fuchs wheels came with matt finish
and solid black spokes.  There are exceptions like the
early unpainted spokes and the body color matched wheels.

> -Is polishing the same as chroming?

No.  Polishing is just that, buffing the aluminum until it
is mirror smooth and shiny.  Chroming is usually a process
of electrically depositing a layer of shiny metallic alloy
(don't know a typical composition, but assume it contains
chromium) to the surface of the item.

> -One of the center caps is missing.  How do they attach/detach?

They usually just pop in/out.  Although, you can get lock
rings for them.

That's an interesting question because it depends on you
point of view and starting point.  If you have an original
Fuchs, then polishing adds a level of work and cost.  If you
have a rough wheel that you want refinished to original, then
(according to Wheel Techniques in Cambell, CA) it must be
polished first, then anodized, then painted, so it costs more.

Keep Porsching,
