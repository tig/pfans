Hi All,
    I have a question that I think some of you may be able to help with. I am
currently in the process of rebuilding my '72 2.4E engine. During disassembly I
managed to damage my flywheel, and am considering purchasing a lightweight
unit. The difference is from 8.5 lbs, stock, to 5 lbs. I know this will improve
throttle response, but what about drivability.
    I am already planning to modify the engine to a 2.5L with a higher
compression ratio (between 9.0 and 9.5 is what I am looking for). I would like
to get the most out of the car without compromising reliability or drivability.
I have heard that the lightweight flywheels are aluminum, and are not as robust
as the original steel. 
    Please let me know what you think. If you have any other changes you think
worthwhile I would like to hear about them as well. I have already planned the
oil bypass modification. My only limitation at this point is that I would like
to keep the MFI system, which means no new cams, or radical changes.
    Thanks in advance for the help.

Regards,
