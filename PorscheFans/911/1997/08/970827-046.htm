<<I've just got my 89 Targa yesterday.  The dealer said that I didn't have a

cat and I could use leaded petrol.  Excuse me for being paranoid but is

there some way that I can quickly check if I have a cat. converter or not?>>

Larry-
I would go back to the dealership and request that they provide you with a
new catalytic converter for your car.  DON'T put it on your car, just keep
it, as your car will perform much better without it (with absolutely no harm
done to your engine).  BUT, DO NOT (!) use leaded gas in an 1989 911.  It
absolutely will ruin your engine.  The reason I say go to your dealer and
demand they give you a cat is b/c it is ILLEGAL for dealer to re-sell a
factory catalyst equipped vehicle without catalytic converters.  That and the
fact that they are about $600 new!  It will add to the resale value of your
car as well as get you by any smog testing that you may encounter.
