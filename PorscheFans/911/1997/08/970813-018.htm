Alex:
You are up for a real challenge keeping cool in a 911SC in Phoenix!  I had
a white (stays cooler?) 79 911SC when I lived there and had the rotary
compressor and two condensers: one in the engine grill, and one in the left
rear fender with an attached electric fan.  Also, I plumbed the A/C output
directly to the larger center vents and kept the heater and fresh air
system completely separate on the remaining lower vents.  Tinted windows as
you know, are a must as well.  Despite all of these measures, this setup
was still no match for any temperature above 100F.  On the upside, the
condenser in the rear fender has not sustained any damage in the four years
that I've had the car.  I don't mean to sound bleak, but the problem was
never solved until I eventually moved to a different climate.  Keep us
posted of your efforts and progress!

Stay Cool,
Best Regards,
Jim Sandahl
