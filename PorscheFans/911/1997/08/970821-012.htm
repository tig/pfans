Rick, congratulations on wanting to join the fold! The '87-'89 3.2 Carrera
line is very similar, virtually identical mechanically, and with only some
minor interior upgrades between '88 and '89. I've got an '87 Targa, which i
bought because I didn't want to put in a roll bar to go to Porsche Club
driver's education events, where coupes and targas don't need rollover
protection , but open cars like cabrios do.

Your '88 candidate car sounds like a really stock, low-option car. The 15"
wheels were stock, but most US deliveries were equipped with the optional
16" wheels. The advantage of hte 15" wheels is a slightly softer ride due
to the taller, more flexible sidewalls of the /70 and /60 series tires,
versus the /55 and /50 series rubber on the 16" wheels.

There is a sticker on the underside of the hood which contains details of
the car's options and equipment. Copy off all the numbers (usually
beginning with "C02") and you can decode them by going to a Web site
(www.kindel.com) where the author has set up a decoder. That'll tell what
the car was delivered with.

Not having seen it, I can't comment on "surface rust". The body panels are
all galvanized, so that slows down the russting process, but doesn't stop
it. If you're talking about a light coating on suspension arms and struts,
etc., that's more or less normal, and can be brushed off. Rust on the body
itself is much more serious.

Have a competent Porsche-familiar mechanic do a thorough pre-purchase
inspection before you buy. Make sure it includes a comression and leakdown
test. Be there when it's done, and ask all the questions that occur to you
as you look over the car.

Good luck!
