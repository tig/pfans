My 84C's leather driver side seat has split its stitching. I have been told
by the local P shop that all I need do is to have then reupholstered. The
seat cushions have also sagged either as a result of 14 years of various
rear ends deforming them or as a result of the recent burst.

Has anyone any experiences with reupholstering their seats and if so are
there any pitfalls that I need to look out for?

I don't want to replace the seats with later ones due to colour matching
problems and would prefer to keep the car as original as possible and
thereby retain its resale value.
