Tom,

I was very disapointed to hear that you had a bad experience with Dan. So, 
since my personal "net reputation" was partialy on the line, I called Dan on
it. He rembers that part(s) in question and said that if you return the item(s)
in question, he will gladly refund your money. If you no longer have the 
peice, try giving him a call to see what he has to say...

I still stand behind him as being a reasonable and honest seller, as this is
more of a hobby to him than an actual business. (let's call it bussiness/hobby)

Dave
