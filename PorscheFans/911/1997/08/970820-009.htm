Dennis,

The local PCA club members were recommending Dunlop D40's or Yokohama
A008's for when I last inquired.  I ended up putting Dunlop D40/M2's on
my '71 and was very pleased.  The 205/55-15 tire sizes fit well and
corrected a minor speedometer error (they have a 5% smaller
circumference).  However, at full steering wheel lock, the inside of the
tires rubbed slightly.  Since I noticed it, I simply do not use full
turns of the steering wheel (parking lots are about the only place you
would do this) and there does not seem to be any more rubbing.

I've not seen or heard of any tire that significantly improved handling
without a longevity compromise, or vice versa.  But these Dunlops handle
very well and tire longevity doesn't seem very bad.
