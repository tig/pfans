I seem to recall the Hayne's manual saying that Targas after a particular
year have an adjustable glass riser so that you can make fine adjustments
to the fit of the window against the upper gasket (attached to the top).
The coupe would not have this sort of adjustment as the assumption is that
if the car body is in correct alignment you don't need it. This could be
the source of your window misalignment.

If you are doing your own work you ought to own a Haynes anyway. It is
definitely not the final authority and is crappy at best, but for $11 it is
way, way under even the poorest Porsche owners repair pain threshold.
