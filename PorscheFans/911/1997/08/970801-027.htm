Dear Fans,

Recently purchased 88 Carrera with Reno SQR 46 radio. Did not get owners =
manual to radio with car. Can anyone send me instructions for operating =
the various knobs and switches? Also is there a wiring diagram with =
booklet about radio? I will probably replace this one eventually and =
that might be handy to have. Has anyone ordered a radio from one of the =
companies that advertise in the back of Car and Driver, Road and Track, =
etc. Their prices are really good but how about service, connectors for =
installing radio, etc. Just curious as I would like to buy as much radio =
as I can for the money.
As always, TIA.

Mark=20
88 Dark "blau"

PS: Can anyone tell me what the 4X5X1.5 aluminum box is that is located =
under the radio?
.
