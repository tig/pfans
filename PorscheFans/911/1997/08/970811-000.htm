Paul Margaritis's solution, pulling the rubber seal away from the
body, depends on having a new, flexible seal, which isn't always the
case.  If your seals are old, they're not only less flexible, but
they're narrower--the replacements are significantly wider.  If you're
willing to sacrifice the seals, you can cut them around the alumnium
deco strip, then pop the windows and replace the seals with new ones
afterward.  

As I said in my earlier note on this subject, another telltale place
is the plastic bead between the fenders and cowl.  Pulling the fenders
away is something most people try to avoid, and indeed makes the
difference between an average job and something that looks factory.
Someone I know with a real 73 RS let this get by on one side, and
there's paint puddling in a low spot.  I notice it--I guess the
average person doesn't.  It can be done, but it's not easy.  You've
got to mask very cleanly, and taper the coat along these telltale
edges.  The pros sometimes take tape and bend it back, creating a
shield that lets less than the normal amount of paint through.
