James:
If it's not leaking, it must be burning.  I'd guess it is the usual 911
problem of worn-out valve guides and seals.  The rings seem unlikely since
your car has only 40k miles on it.  If the rings are really bad, the car
will probably visibly smoke when driven hard at high rpm.

I had a similar situation with my 79 a few years back and a top-end rebuild
solved the problem ( although I put rings in too because the engine had a
good 100k miles on it already ).  It now burns about 1qt./1500 miles some
30k miles later.  The occasional cold-start puff is normal from what I've
heard.

The only other possibility is that you just have too much oil in the car. 
Since you're a new owner, I'll note that the oil level is accurate only
when the engine is idling and at normal operating temperature.

Best Regards,
Jim Sandahl
