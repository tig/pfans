Consider the pre-purchase inspection your insurance agianst something that
could be hidden.  If you don't do it, you accept the risk that something could
be wrong with the car that will appear after you pay for it.  Typical
inspections are $100 or so  around here (LA)  Take it to someone that is
reputable and that you trust (Someone on this list should be able to suggest a
mechanic in your area. If you are in the South Bay (redondo beach) area,  take
it to Lomita 911 (310) 534-3631, talk to Dieter or Dereck
$13,800 sounds about right.  I have seen cars at used dealers around here
asking $16,000 for a 79 SC targa. I have seenprivate ads for similar models in
the 12-14K range, although I never looked at any of them.
Good Luck
