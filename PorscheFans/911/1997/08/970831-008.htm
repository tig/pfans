It's possible; recommend you get the alignment done.  Also, is car
lowered?  As it is lowered, naturally get more negative camber due to 
supsension design that is difficult to eliminate.  A closer to factory height
allows for more room for alignment adjustment.

I have one more track event, and a few longer drives to do on my 87 coupe..
I've noticed the front inner sides of my A008Ps are very very low (just
below wear bar).  I've been told it's a case of to much negative camber
with toe out.

I don't think the car has ever had an alignment from the previous owner, is
it common for these cars to get out of alignment?  The rears are quite low
as well (30k kms) so I plan to replace all 4 (sensible thing to do) and get
an alignment.

Anyone care to enlighten me on the front end situation?
