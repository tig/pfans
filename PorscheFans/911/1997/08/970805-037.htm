 Ed Mellinger asks about the Tilton starters advertised to weigh less
(which they do).  I bought a similar geared starter from Gene Berg
Enterprises in the $180 range as I recall for my race car.  It has worked
fine over four years even though it is advertised as for VWs. (Little
know fact that a VW  engine will bolt up to a 911 transmission  or a 356,
and vice versa, and the 12 volt VW ring gear must have same number of
teeth as the Porsches).   I see in the latest Excellence someone
advertising a geared starter for about the same price, so Tilton faces
some price competition.  On the other hand, a race car's starter doesn't
get the workout a daily driver's does, at least not at my twice a month for
half a year rate of use.

These geared starters seem to be a better mousetrap - weigh less,
crank as fast, have more cranking power if you have a high squeeze
motor, and don't seem to require more amps.  The motors and internal
gearing are made, I believe, for a Japanese car, and just need an adapter
and perhaps the engagement gear to fit a variety of other cars - you see
them advertised for use on big Detroit iron also.

required purchase of a starter)
