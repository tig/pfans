Alan,

For normal driving, the 10W-30 Mobil 1 is no doubt just fine, and superior
in terms of engine wear and fuel economy characteristics to a 15W-50, as
long as oil pressure is maintained within specs, and your engine oil does
not run unusually hot.

That said, there are good reasons for using the 15W-50... Under severe
conditions (high heat, high revs) you are less likely to have film
breakdown, and serious damage, with this higher viscosity oil. If you take
it to the track for driver education events, or ever see your oil temp above
mid-gauge, you should probably be using the higher viscosity oil

You will of course see many different opinions on this subject. Safest thing
is just to follow your manual's recommendations.
