With factory air installed in a 1972 911T, did the installation also 
include an external front oil cooler?

If not, I am curious to know what the engine's oil temperature 
typically runs at when the A/C is on and you are driving around on a 
100F day.  Does the car have adequate cooling capacity or is an 
external oil cooler a necessity.

The reason that I ask is that I am considering the purchase of a '72 
911T coupe without factory air.  If I buy it, I would like to have an 
original (used) Behr A/C system installed (and updated) by 
Performance Aire.  

I am thinking that if an oil cooler is mandatory, it would probably 
make the installation of the A/C system prohibitively expensive.

I anticipate that it will cost around $2000 to install the A/C 
system and then another $1000 to install the front oil cooler.  Add 
this to a purchase price of $6700, and I'll be in deeper than I 
should be.

Why a '72?  I like the early body style best.

What do you think?
