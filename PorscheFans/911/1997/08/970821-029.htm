   Have to agree with Steve Gilbert on this one. There are few shops who
are willing to do a competent job of repainting a car, much less changing=

the color. I would rather have a car with so-so original paint than a col=
or
change.
   Besides that, WHY did they change the color. Too many times you find o=
ut
after the fact that the car has had significant damage.
   My car has been repainted in the original color and it still bugs me. =
I
have spent hours cleaning up overspray and touching up areas the body sho=
p
didn't want to be "bothered" with.
