I did spring for the $30 cerificate and was somewhat disappointed, the
reason being I got more information when I visited the factory 15 years
ago.  In 1982, if you were taking the factory tour, you could give them
your VIN number and get the kardex info.  The factory was also able to
tell me the original point of delivery, and the date built, neither of
which appear on the new certificates.  However, at the factory they just
scribbled the info on notepaper.

I believe it's a nice touch when an auto manufacturer keeps track of
every car they have ever built.  Reportedly, if you send the factory a
photo of your car, they'll keep it in their records.
