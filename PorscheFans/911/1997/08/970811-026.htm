Jim, recovering the dash is not an easy job that requires a heap of
patience. Normally seams are sewn around the instrument cluster  but I have
managed to get my dash out in one piece. All leather is different so try on
a scrap of leather first to see how it will react to wetting it with water.
I don't think you can use staples to fix it because it's mainly a steel
frame. Just glue a section at a time, always seeing which way to stretch
the leather so it will fit into the instrument cluster section. Don't glue
under the main part of the leather, just where it folds around the edges
and if you keep it out of the sun, it should last for many years without
shrinking & cracking. My shop is not in Northern California, It's in
Australia.
	Regards Dean.
