Andrew, if the stitching has just let go, take it to an auto trimmer and
get them to restitch it before the leather stretches out of shape. If the
leather is out of shape we can sometimes wet it and pull it back into shape
before stitching. I have done this many times with success, especially if
the leather has not too much sun damage and become brittle. A bit of extra
foam under the cushions to lift it might be all it needs. This would be a
lot cheaper than an all new leather retrim. As you might guess this is my
trade so feel free to ask me on any trimming probs. By the way, where is
Thebarton?
	Regards Dean.
