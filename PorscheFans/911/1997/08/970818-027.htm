I'm looking to purchase an 85 911 that is for sale in my area.  I've 
downloaded the 911 FAQ, bought the 911 Illustrated Buyers Guide and read 
about as much as I can on this car.  A few questions:

1) I'm taking the car to a dealer this week to have them do a 1 hour 
prepurchase inspection.  They said that they look the car over and give 
it a test ride.  What else should I have them look at?

2) The car has 120K on it and the current owner (who is the second one) 
bought the car with 15K on it.  He's done most of the maintenance 
himself so there are few reciepts.  What should I look for?

3) Any comments on this year 911 that I should know about.

This will be my first 911 so I want to make sure that I do it right.  If 
you could reply privately as I'm not on the list yet.

Thanks
Devin
