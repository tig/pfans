My SC did a similar thing.  Turned out to be an oil leak from the thermostat
O-ring on the top of the engine leaking into the bell housing where the
clutch is.  When I took the clutch apart, it was soaked with oil.  I didn't
realize there was an oil leak until it got real bad and was leaking onto the
heat exchanger & making lots of smoke.

I too have an 85 Carrera (120K miles) which shudders when letting out the
clutch in reverse. The car will shake and rattle like the motor is about to
fall out until I push the clutch back in. It only happens in reverse, runs
well in all forward gears. If I let the clutch all the way out in reverse
then it will buck and surge most of the time. Any advice is appreciated.
