I JUST got a 1970 911s. It was given to me by my wife's cousin. I need
serious help!

Here's the history.

1. 1970 911E Sportomatic
2. 65,000 kilometers on the counter (about 40,000 miles)
3. Sat in a garage for ten years in Japan
4. Given to somebody who I believe tried to race it (I'll explain later)
5. When I picked it up yesterday, the guy said "Well, we got it running.
I think its only running on two cylinders. It smokes a lot."
6. There is no alternator
7. Two hoses coming from the "Firewall" on the rear passenger side are
disconnected and I don't know where they go.
8. Oil smells like turpentine
9. A wire coming from the same general direction as the two hoses is
left
disconnected (I believe this is going to the batteries. Not sure though)
10. I have NO documentation (although I just ordered a Haynes manual.)


I would like some advice from others who have worked on this model who
could correspond with me if I have questions

I would like advice on where to start my journey. Think a overhaul is in
the future? Cost? Where can I get parts? Documentation?

Where do those two hoses go? What does that wire connect to? 


I need help. I live near Sacramento (Yuba City), CA.

Can you recommend catalogs, manuals, etc.

Funds are kind of limited. I'm in the Air Force. 

Please help me get this running.

Thank you in advance

Please forward this to any friends who might be able to help me. Any
advice is appreciated.
