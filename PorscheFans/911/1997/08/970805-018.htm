I know there are a lot of tricks to working on Porsches but the 
seemingly simple is eluding me.  Is there some trick to installing the 
headlight trim rings?  The reason I ask is that after I removed the 
retaining screw at the bottom of the ring the rings was still held very 
firmly in place.  In fact, it took considerable prying to pop it off.  
In looking at the ring it is clear that there is a sort of lip that 
mates with the fender.  I figured installation would be the reverse of 
removal, ie. engage the lips all arround and then install the retaining screw.

For the life of me I can't seem to get the trim ring to fully engage 
the fender lip around it's circumference.  Do you hook the top or 
bottom first?  Is it necessary to "ovalize" the ring to get it to 
engage?  I'm very reluctant to use the retaining screw to pull the ring 
in place since it could easily strip.

Thanks in advance,
