Josh -

Before you get too carried away replacing your trombone cooler, check to
make sure that the engine-mounted cooler, and its thermostat, are both
working.  My '83 recently started being both slow to warm up its oil,
and quick to go into the 90-100C range during spirited driving.  I put 
a temperature probe (a common digital multimeter accessory... any
remote-readout thermometer will do) into the engine cooler from below
and observed a warmup cycle.  Suprise... warm oil started arriving at
the engine cooler right away, rather than after warmup.  Diagnosis:
thermostat stuck partway open.  Replacing the thermostat requires engine
removal so I'm living with it for now; I can get away with this because
summers are cool where I live, though I'm not happy about the effects of
the slow warmup. 

Just an additional factor to consider; you may well want more cooling up
front too, but it would be a drag to spend $$ up there and still be
running hot due to a problem with the engine cooler.

Anyone else have experience with sticking engine cooler thermostats?
