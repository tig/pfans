You may ignore it under motion. Like the dipstick reading, the gauge is
only of value when the car is warm, level and idling. At that time the
gauge should read in the "white". I like to keep mine just about mid-range.
The gauge is very sensitive, as Bob Tindel pointed out, and will bounce
wildly as the car moves. If the car is not quite warm you can get a
reassuring wave from the needle by just rocking the car from your seat
while waiting at a light. In fact, get in the habit of reading it then. The
range of the needle is something on the order of 2 quarts, so be careful
not to overfill the tank (oil) in an effort to get a high reading.

You can use the gauge to tell you when to stop adding oil by watching it
through the rear window (well, at least on a Targa, certainly on a cab sans
top). Get to know the gauge and how it operates--the Porsche engineering
team is at the top of their game and did not go through all the trouble to
design the oil level readout system if it was not useful let alone leave it
in the car all those years. As an engineer myself, I can understand the
need to do things easily and avoid work as it is well-known that an
engineer will work very hard to avoid work! Imagine Fritz and Hans sitting
around the drafting table some years ago...

Fritz: You know, Hans--since vee moved the oil fill port on the 911 into
the engine compartment it is quite a pain to check the oil level!

Hans: Yah, Fritz, there must be a vetter vay.

Ferry <walking up from behind>: What are you boys talking about?

<Fritz and Hans jump up>

Hans <nervously>: Vell, Sir, we vas just tinking that the dipstick in der
engine comparrrtment auf der 911 ist der pain to check.

Hans: Yah, it would be good to have another vey to do it.

Ferry: Well, think on it. In der meantime, will one of you see what is
wrong with the wasser closet in der executive men's room. Sounds like the
float valve is leaking...
