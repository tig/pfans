Bruce, this topic came up just a few weeks ago.  I always have the same =
question in the back of my mind as I, not so infrequently, drive briskly =
with my uncovered top down.  So far nothing bad has happened.  I chimed =
in last time wanting to know if anyone had ever blown their top off. =20

I got several private responses suggesting that since I leave the top =
down "most" of the time to just leave it down and covered.

I am being lazy because when I run into a store of something I put it up =
and take it down when I come back.  I always leave the back window =
unzipped.

Don't blame me if yours blows off but my advice is to not worry.  Just =
keep the speed below 130 or so when runing uncovered.  Or for that fact =
with the top down.  At least that's what my informal testing has =
determined. :)
