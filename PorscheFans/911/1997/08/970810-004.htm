Hi P-Fans,

Last night I was making a short (10 miles) trip to the store and about
halfway into the trip my 1987 911 Coupe decided it did not want to run
anymore.  The car was not up to operating temp and I was moving along at
50mph.  Before I came to a complete stop the car refired and I continued
to the store.  Made a 5 min stop and went to restart the car.  It
started for about 15 sec (ran rough though) and then died.  I tapped on
the DME a few times and then the car refired, and I came home with no
problems.  Let me back up, when I left my house I noticed the car was
surging a little in second gear.

My question is:  Is my DME going and were is the least expensive place
to get one.  Called the Dealer once before and they wanted over
$1,000.00 for it.  Any other things I should check.  Thanks
