I think the '79 came with a 20m bar from the factory.

I don't know.  Carreras starting using 22mm front bars in '86, I believe.

Depends on your application a little.  If you want all-out performance,
use the hard polyurethane bushings.  Otherwise the stick rubber ones
are OK.

Stock bushings can be had from the dealer (I've bought them from
Stoddard's in the past).  Most mail-order places have the poly ones.

Glycerine's probably OK on the rubber ones.  I've used regular bearing
grease on the rubber ones and I'm fond of that Teflon based lube that
Tweeks, et al sells for the poly bushings.
