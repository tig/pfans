I recently posted a message about a 911 T (72) that I just bought. I stated
that the car would cut out, stop running, backfire, miss generally just run
like poop when it reached opperating temps. Well I got back lots of great
responses and some great info. Thanks to all who answered my plea for help. I
now have some new questions. I think ive narrowed the problem to the tank not
venting correctly. If I undo the hose in the trunk, on the top of the tank it
seems to run fine.  When I put it back on then drive it till it warms up it
does all of the above. Now your problally saying just drive with the hose
off. I have a problem with this because the gas fumes that get into the
interior just about knock me out. So heres my Questions.

1) Does this seem like a reasonalbe diagonosis of the problem and has any one
encountered this before.

2) Does any one know what all of those hoses coming off the top of the tank
do and i noticed one  going into a black box  then out to the front of the
car. Whats all this doing seems like over kill for just venting the tank.

3) Does any one have a chart on a Bosch Mech. fuel Inj. I saw some in the
Automotion cat. but they didnt have one for mech. inj.

Well thats it for now all answers will be greatly appreciated.
