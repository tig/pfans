Greg,

I don't know if this will help with a newer car.

I financed my 1967 911 with "The Collector Car Loan Company of
America".  The guy in Denver is Karl Sauer at 303-782-9494.  He found a
bank in Denver that would go three years.  I was pleased with his
service.  He lined up financing in about three days, if I recall correctly. 
His fees came from the bank, so I didn't write him a check (directly
anyways).  This was all in 1991.  He was still in town in 1993.

hopefully a '84-'88 Carrera.  My credit union only offers 24 month terms
for '86 and older cars, which is going to make it a little tough right now.
  
Anyone know of someone that specializes in Porsche loans that might be
able to offer better terms?
