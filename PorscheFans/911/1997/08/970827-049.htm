 Marc,

I own a 76 3.0 Liter Carrera and love it.  The 3.0L Carrera was the top of
the line normally aspirated 911 available in model year 1976.  The engine is
basically the same as the turbo, sans the turbocharger of course, hence the
930/2 designation.  There were only about a thousand of them made and
another thou or so in model year 1977.  Porsche then took the body style and
the 3.0 liter engine, albeit detuned a bit, and produced the SC beginning in
1978.  The 76 3 Liter produces 200 hp and the 78 SC 188.

If this car you're looking at is a true Carrera the VIN should be something
like 91166XXXX.  Also the dash has NO vents for air at all.  There is one
tiny vent on each side about even with the ignition switch primarily to
throw a little defrosting air on the door windows.  Therefore AC was
standard equipment.  The AC unit sits under the dash and extends all the way
from one side of the car to the other.  It actually does a better job of
cooling the car than some of the newer models.  At least it moves a lot of
air.  I have replaced the old York compressor with a rotary and installed a
terbatrol  oil cooler which helps keep the temp down, in the car and the
engine compartment.

I would say that the engine is fairly bullet proof.  It did have the chain
tensioner problems as did all earlier 911s.  I got to buy a new engine right
after purchasing the car (it was about 6 years old) because of the
tensioners failing.  Unfortunately I didn't know what a failed tensioner
sounded like so I blasted right through it and the engine died a terrible
death.  The new engine came with the oil fed tensioners so I don't expect
that to happen again.  I now have about 125K miles on the car and no real
problems to report-and I drive it real hard.  I do need a new clutch though.
It was slipping a little when I dropped the clutch at 6000 RPM during the
drag races at the Parade.  If this didn't blow it up I think it is pretty
strong.

Also the motor came with a 5 bladed fan with a smaller pulley to run it a
higher speed.  This was OK for Germany with al the Autobahn driving but is
not so good for our type of driving.  I changed it out for an 11 bladed fan
for the extra low speed cooling.

Since the engine is basically the same as the SC there is not much trouble
getting parts for it.  Same for the body etc.  there are some internal
differences, cams etc, but even if the original part was not available a
substitute certainly would be.  I haven't had any trouble.  It seems most
parts people are familiar with the 3.0L Carrera (or at least profess to be).
I always mention what it really is, just in case there is some difference.
So far everything I've bought has fit and is working well.

Hope this helps.  If I can answer any other questions fell free to contact
me at the address below.
