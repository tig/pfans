Was the clutch bled? You may have an air bubble or water-laden fluid down
in there that is giving you the "old" feel. The clutch master is fed from
the brake fluid reservoir, but has it's own bleed valve like those found on
the calipers. It should be bled when the brakes are bled and I would think
when the clutch is replaced just on principle.

I don't believe there is any adjustment, in fact, that is one of the
reasons for implementing the cost and complexity of an hydralic clutch.

Is it possible that the clutch job wasn't done? Or did not need to be done?
