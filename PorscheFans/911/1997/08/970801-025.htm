Ed,

Your best bet I would say is your PCA Region president; they should
ALL get a copy of the "Parade Competition Rules" or "PCR"s.  For
autocrosses run by the PCA, this is probably the place to look.

If you want to stay in "stock" class, would also say give a call to the 
people putting on or running your local events.  The rules are different
between SCCA and the Porsche Club, and it is also possible that if 
your local regions is putting on an autocross, they might decide to toss
out the PCRs and set up their own classes (to avoid possibly having
30 entrants running in 30 different classes; with PCRs it IS possible).

(reply to):

I was wondering where to get ahold of the PCA Club Race Rules or
whatever they use to classify cars for time trials and/or autocrosses in
PCA.  Everyone keeps referring to them, but a few of us want to know
just what we can do with our cars to remain in stock class.  In other
words, how much can we get away with, because "stock" class seems very
liberal?  Is there a web site out there with Club Race rules or can I
actually order this document?
