I have a 90 C4 (i know that's cheating) but  drive it all winter as my only
car... i took it from boston to quebec city last january when the temp was
-20 in quebec... it was the ultimate winter test .... i found that winter
P-210's work well as high performance winter tires.... the heat exchangers
are pretty lame in anything below ten degrees below zero.. i took a photo
of it after finishing the trip with  600 miles of pure salted roads ... the
(original black) car was pure white with dried salt...i'll post it
somewhere.. the salt had even creeped through the window seals, it wreaked
havoc on the internal (drum) parking brake assembly and made the cv boots
shudder with pain... i know that Dr. Porsche would much rather have his
cars used this way then have them hermetically sealed during inclamate
weather... thats why i practice parking brake donuts in large parking lots
that are full of white snow... i find that the underbody pans on the C4-C2
help keep snow build-up to a minimum.. this is a good thing.

-Use your cars; don't pamper them--- Dr. Porsche would approve.
