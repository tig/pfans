Yes, you probably need R offset 7" rims, the standard 911 offset will
probably not work in the rear. They will fit on the front, however
that will make the front track wider than the rear. 
Here is a post I did a few years ago :

On my '72 S, most of the combinations of 7x15 and 7x16 that were
recommended by several people won't fit on the rear. i.e.

 - stock 911 offset 7x16 in the rear with a 205/55 
 - stock 911 offset 7x15 all around with 205/60s 
 - stock 911 offset 7x15 all around with 205/50s front - 225/50s rear 

I can not even fit 195/60/15 on the rear with stock 7" rims.
But my car is as low as it will go and still handle well. And the 911
cars are not all the same, so try to borrow the size you are interested
in and drive it HARD to see what happens.

I had only slight rubbing problems with 225/50/15 on stock 7x15 on the
front. This was cured by rolling the fender lips.
But on the rear I had to use the early "911R offset" Revolution wheels.
They are fairly cheap but MUCH heavier than a Fuchs forged alloy.

The stock 7" rims have all the extra 1" width (compared to the 6" rim)
on the outside of the rim. The 911R has more extra width on the inside. 
I think the offset on the different rims are :

Wheel      Backspacing  Offset
Stock 6"   4 7/8"       1 7/8"
Stock 7"   4 7/8"       1 3/8"  (Extra 1" is on the outside)
911R  7"   5 1/8"       1 5/8"  (1/4" more of extra 1" on the outside)
REV.  7"   5 3/8"       1 7/8"  (stock 6" offset, .5" added both sides)

Still, the 225/50 tires on the revolution wheels rubbed on the inside 
spring plate nuts (they did a bit on the 6" rims too), so I had to use 1/4" 
spacers under the wheels, which makes the offset like the real 911R wheels.
This combination looks funny because the front track is wider than the rear,
and may not be great for high speed track driving (may oversteer).

The 7x15 with 225/50/15's sure make an early 911 look muscular!
Too bad I had to go back to 6x15s for SCCA stock class... 
I guess I can still run the big ones in PCA!
