Full stiff on the rears is the "3" position (full clockwise).  My rears are the
type with the small "adjusting button" - I don't remember the "center rod
with an allen wrench" adjustent, but I assume the stiffness adjustment
is the same.

They are a PITB to adjust.  I set mine to "2" if I remember right.  It seems
there is enough weight in the rear to run them pretty stiff without affecting
the ride much.  R1s and the fronts on full stiff are great for the track -
but that
causes my vertebrae to rattle like castenets, so I have to set the fronts
to full soft for street use...
