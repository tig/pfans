At last week's Cryogenic Engineering Conference, a friend from APD told
me of a new refrigerant they had developed called FR-12(tm). It is
marketed by FRIGC. Their website is: http://www.frigc.com/

FR-12 is a mixed gas that is supposed to offer the same cooling
capability as R-12 and is "EPA SNAP accepted as a safe alternative to
R-12". It is supposed to be compatible with existing a/c system
lubricants (no need for new equipment) and it has a lower discharge
pressure than R-134A, which means it puts less stress on the
air-conditioning system.

Supposedly, what is done is the a/c is flushed, new oil and fittings put
on and if necessary, the receiver drier replaced. 

Has anyone else heard of FR-12 or better yet converted to it? If this
works, it will save me $$ avoiding changing to R134A.
