Doug,

Can vouch for problems with Weltmeister; shifter can hang up with this 
installation, epoxy between lower shift fulcrum (in kit) and shift lever
breaks, I even snapped the bolt on the link fitting between the front &
rear linkage (under cover on rear passenger floor).

The factory kit that they put in the '86 cars worked like a charm; no
problems.

(Note:  this was on a '84 Carrera Turbo-Look)

I recently purchased my 82 911SC Targa and of course it has the mile
long shifter throw...(Second gear actually hits the seat)I've looked
into purchasing the Weltmeister Short Shift Kit and was just about ready
to drop the cash, when I spoke with another gentleman who related that
many people are unhappy with the kits. He heard people complain that the
shifting mechanism became very stiff and even hard to get into gear... I
was wondering if anyone out there in Porscheland had experience with the
kit, and what they thought of it.
