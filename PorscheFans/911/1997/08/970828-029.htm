Clemson:

What I'm about to suggest isn't exactly an autocross school, but I'd say
it's better.  On Monday, September 29, I am renting out the big track at
Willow Springs Int'l Raceway and putting on one of my semi annual driver
training events.  Experienced instructors will teach you about high
performance driving, and you'll get over 3 hours of open track time, with
or without an instructor, at your choice.  You also get to ride with the
instructors in our cars which, aside from being a blast, is very
educational and speeds up the learning curve substantially.

I recently posted about this event on Pfans, and it appears from the
responses that there will be a number of Pfans members there.  It is not
limited to Porsches, though.  There will be all kinds of cars there,
including Ferraris, NSX's, RX-7's, and many others.  Cost is $225 for the
day, which includes all event fees, coffee and danish in the morning,
lunch and drinks all day.  If you're interested, send me an email and I'll
send you an entry form.
