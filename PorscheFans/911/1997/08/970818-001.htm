The best of recollection the sunroof has not changed in all the years as
far as overall design. Start by winding crank in older models or electric
back about a couple of inches. This will expose the leading edge of 
the headliner attached to the sunroof panel. This upholstered panel
is attached by metal V-clips up into the s-roof. Slip a thin (plastic glass
sticks work best) between the uphol. and the metal of the s-roof and
pop apart. there are 5-7 clips only on the leading edge. Pull down the 
uphol. panel into a bow of about an inch or so and slide the uphol. panel
back as if the roof were sliding back into the main roof cavity. You will
now see the interior metal of the s-roof panel. Close the roof and remove
the four 8 mm bolts holding the panel to the cable/track assm. The roof
will now lift out. As far as the seals, they are abominable in price from
Porsche and I have not looked hard enuf for adequate replacements,
they are just simple felt strips!!!! However from the dealer they appear
from memory long, therefore match them to yours before removing.
A certain bugaboo to look for----- The seam at the rear edge overlaps
and drops , sitting at a keyboard rather than out in the shop does not 
help right now  ;<)  but it exists on the L and R rear corners TAKE NOTE
Also a dry fit may release a little tension (yours!) Then a little (sparingly)
contact cement or w-strip adhesive, do'nt want that goo messing up
your fur, try this stuff on the cat that uses your car as pedestal onto
which she preens herself!!! Anyway, after satisfied with seals, reinstall
panel into roof, align bolts for optimum fit- adjustment room is there,slide
roof back via switch or crank, pull (slide) uphol. panel out to match 
leading edge and pop clips in, wipe up the paw prints and your done.
It can also benifit you to spray some lithium grease into the cable tracks
whilst the roof panel is out and alittle silicone on the uphol. panel will 
not hurt on the sliding edges. Any ???sss
