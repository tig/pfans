The top is like a shoe. All that folding and bending eventually takes its
toll. The creases are where the vinyl goes first, even though the overall
top may be in fine condition. The only way to preserve the top for the
maximum time is to not fold it. If possible, leave the top in your garage
up on edge. As for the stowing, as long as the top isn't compressed tightly
by some heavy object it will be fine. Also, a good vinyl cleaner and
dressing will maximize the life of the top. Fine grit and dirt lodged in
the vinyl pattern will contribute to an early demise.
