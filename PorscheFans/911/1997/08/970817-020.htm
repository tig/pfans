Hi Josh,

Someone advised me to get a Carrera Fan, Housing (Aluminum
surround) and matching alternator.  I ignored this advice
and spent a whole lot of time chasing parts.  It turns out
you can order the 245mm fan and the housing from the factory
but it won't fit the alternator in your car.  If you buy a
new SC alternator they throw in a spacer to make it fit but
the spacer isn't available alone.  This drove me nuts last
winter.

If you get the works out of a Carrera you need to upgrade
your external voltage regulator and wiring to the internal
regulator on the later alternator.  There's a tech bulletin
on this in the back of the '74 - '89 parts book ($10 at your
dealer).

As for the upgrade itself, I did mine while with the engine
out while stripping it to a long block, but you should be able to:

1) remove alternator belt
2) remove all shroud bolts into the fan housing
3) remove allen bolt on wraparound strap
4) lift/pull whole assembly back (may have to unbolt
   more of the shroud for clearance).
5) mark & disconnect wiring harness & ground strap

Anyone who's BTDT is welcome to correct me.  I'd like
to know for reference.

The new stuff should go in pretty much the same way the
old came out.  Getting fan blades off alternators is entertaining.
Mine came off with me holding the fan and my mechanic tapping
the shaft with a brass hammer...

Good luck,

p.s. your current fan is 225mm.
