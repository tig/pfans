Hi Guys First time to put in a note from me. 

Owned a 1990 C4 modified to RS spec until mid July 97

sold and now I'm bumming about in HK.



Looking forward to an Arena Red  Turbo 4 on my arrival 

back in the UK.



A questions for you (like me) air cooled freaks

Have you used Zymol wax and is it worth the money?

I have and say it was fantastic - but it was a present

and don't know if i would spend so much to replace it

over in the uk its 100 pounds for jar (10-15 apps)

of Concours wax; gave the car a fantastic mirror gloss finish. 

Is there a cheaper alternative I hear Silicon based waxes are

bad for the paintwork?



Also Ive seen pics of the new' 911 - and the question is 

is it a boxter saloon ?



Any guys out there with  Turbo 4's - what are they like to live with

my C4 was a dream with reasonable fuel economy for performance

(its a big issue in the uk with ~0.7 pounds per litre of 98 oct)



Any strange or awkward traits with the Turbo 4 etc 

all info warmly welcomed



cheers



Tarik
