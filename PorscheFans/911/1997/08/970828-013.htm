Hi P-Fans,

I still can't post to the list due to an admin glitch and Lou is kindly
forwarding this so please don't hit "Reply" to sender,
reply to jagernauth_stephen@bns.att.com.

 I have a neat gauge which was custom made from 2 smaller VDO
gauges by cutting housings apart and epoxying them into a
VDO clock housing fitting the stock 911 clock location.  1 gauge
measures cyl head temp and the other gauge is a voltmeter,
i.e. creating a single gauge with 2 analog scales.
The cyl head temp gauge has 6 numbered LEDs and a 6-way rotary
switch is dash-mounted corresponding to cyl 1-6 and measures
temps from 100-600 deg F in 50deg increments.   You turn the switch,
the LED lights up and you read the temp for that cylinder.  The gauge was
taken off when my motor was upgraded and I want to re-install it to monitor
engine temperatures:   I need to hook up the (6) leads to sensors.

Where exactly should I hook up the cyl head temp sensors?
How easy from under the car w/o engine removal?
 Which sensors to use?  Are there generic sensors I can get
or are they specific to the VDO gauge in impedance/resistance etc?
Is there any value in doing this to more accurately monitor engine
temp rather than going by oil temp?

Should I wire the voltmeter directly to the battery to measure
charging voltage?  (I had an overcharging problem due to a
bad voltage regulator and I want to catch this early)

This will be one of my winter projects to keep me from going batty.

Thanks for any input,
