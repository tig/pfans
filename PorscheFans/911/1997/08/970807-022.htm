And, here is the text of the S1Z page without the picture:

The AVS S1-z is a further development of Yokohama's AVS (Advanced
Vehicle
System) range of tyres and is the company's new flagship high
performance
radial aimed at serious drivers 

Tread Compound and Design 

 1) A new tread compound named ARC
 (Advanced Response Compound) is
 incorporated in the AVS S1-z. It utilises silica
 in an advanced recipe that responds
 positively to extreme temperatures
 encountered in high performance driving. 

 2) The tread pattern is designed to meet the
 two key development goals of optimised
 anti-aquaplaning performance and
 unrivalled cornering grip. Wide, straight
 grooves provide straight line stability in both
 wet and dry conditions whilst a V-shaped
 arrangement of slanted and straight grooves
 boost water channeling power for improved
 wet weather performance. 

                                                                         


Dual-split Traction Stabilising (DTS) blocks, meanwhile, are the key to
the AVS
S1-z's cornering grip. The outer part of the block is longer and is
marked by a
piping groove which acts to increase grip as cornering forces increase,
whilst its
angled-shaped inner section acts to maintain rigidity. 

Construction

1) Jointless nylon fibre covers are used to provide better uniformity at
high speed.
Two layers are applied with edge covers to ensure reliable high speed
integrity. 

2) two steel "Softech" belts are also incorporated. (3/97)
