Tom, from what I have seen Bruce Anderson write, 350,000 without a major
engine reuild is not unheard of. I am the second owner (purchased 4
years ago with 150,000 on theodometer). The only things I have had done
is to add Carrera chain tensioners and at the same time replace the
rubber(?) coverings for the injectors which had rotted.

The engine is extremely tight and burns less than 1 liter/3000 miles. I
had been using RedLine, changing every 7500 miles, but my mechanic went
changed shops and put in Kenday GT1 on the last oil change. What's
really impressive about the engine is that it doesn't leak oil.

I believe the catalytic converter was replaced (having caught fire) by
the original owner at 60,000 miles. The transmission has had syncros
replaced at 175,000 miles. All other maintainance is routine.

The car is a daily driver, averaging 1,000 miles/month. My milage
averages ca. 21 mpg. I intend to keep the car until my 9 year old son
turns 25.

Hope this helps. IF anybody has advice for keeping 911's alive, I'd like
to see their posts.

Regards, Bob Fagaly
'8- 911SV Targa
204,954 miles.
