I've done two. A 993 with stock suspension. I prefer the Eibach 
springs and I suggest the kit which lowers 1 inch. H and R and the 
regular Eibach ,lower the car too much, beware of curbs, manhole 
covers, and cross speedbumps diagonally. In short ( snicker) too low.

The other is a 993 with M030. Tried H and R turbo springs. Too low 
and the springs and shocks didn't work well together. Agree with Ray, 
I bought the 993 M030 Euro springs from Windward and I'm happy. 
Lowers the car one inch and works well on the street and on the track.

Contrary to popular belief even the M030 does not have adjustable 
supension height, neither does the stock 993. The front perches are 
adjustable but not the rears. 

For a 993 with stock suspension, I'd go with  the Eibach 1" lowering
springs.  If you get the job done at a dealer expect to pay near 500
bucks for the change including a 4 wheel alignment plus the cost of 
the springs.  Good time to get a track alignment using RS specs or 
even more negative camber -2 deg. if you don't do a lot of street 
driving.
