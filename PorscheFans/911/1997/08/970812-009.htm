Yes, your symtoms are correct with a fuel tank developing a vacuum due
to insufficient venting. Therefore, the car can't get enough fuel and
you experienced a rough running engine. The black hoses and black box
was Porsche's attempt to provide some emmision control over the tank
vapors, venting, etc.  My hoses and box were missing when I got my 70
911T, so I had to plug the big vent on top of the tank.  ILO that vent,
I drilled two small hoses in the side of the gas cap for venting and to
prevent a vacuum build up.

>>I recently posted a message about a 911 T (72) that I just bought. I stated
that the car would cut out, stop running, backfire, miss generally just
run like poop when it reached opperating temps. Well I got back lots of
great responses and some great info. Thanks to all who answered my plea
for help. I now have some new questions. I think ive narrowed the
problem to the tank not venting correctly. If I undo the hose in the
trunk, on the top of the tank it seems to run fine.  When I put it back
on then drive it till it warms up it does all of the above. Now your
problally saying just drive with the hose off. I have a problem with
this because the gas fumes that get into the interior just about knock
me out. So heres my Questions.

1) Does this seem like a reasonalbe diagonosis of the problem and has
any one encountered this before.

2) Does any one know what all of those hoses coming off the top of the
tank do and i noticed one  going into a black box  then out to the front
of the car. Whats all this doing seems like over kill for just venting
the tank.>>
