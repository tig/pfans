First, you ask, is the 924 is a good car?  Yes, but like all cars they 
have their problems.

Second, you may not want a "real" Porsche, if that means what everyone, 
who is a dyed in the wool expert, claims.  Could you afford it?  
Furthermore, the definition is too subjective as to what a 'real' Porsche 
is.  Here is why.

The Search For the Holy Grill

Our story starts, bearing the name of Porsche, in May 1948, but it really 
goes back into the late 30's.  It was the Type 64 and was built in 1939.  
The man that started it all was Ferdinand Porsche.  Porsche also built a 
military tank in 1945 called the "Maus".  In many ways it was ahead of 
its time with special crumple zones and dent resistant doors.  Could this 
be considered the real Porsche?

Going back in history, let's say July 1947, Porsche started work on it's 
"own" car bearing the Porsche name.  There were a group of driving 
loyalists who reveled in Porsche's latest offering called the Type 356.  
It was a delightful driver's car which claimed a long list of followers, 
even to this day.  The engine, by the way, was a version of VW's four 
cylinder boxer engine.  There were other tidbits from Volkswagen thrown 
in for good measure, but nobody really likes to talk about it.  The car 
earned the nick name The Bath Tub".

In the 60's, Porsche introduced a new model called the 901.  The gods of 
Peugeot already had religious rights to that number and the design was 
swiftly changed to 911.  The 356 crowd immediately called "foul! That's 
not a 'real' Porsche!"  The rear end was too heavy, "and what was that 
hanging out past the rear wheels?"  Many people thought the six cylinder 
engine was not a "real" Porsche engine compared to the sweet four 
cylinder power plant that pushed the 356 into the lime light.

Then came relief, at least for those dyed in the wool Porsche fans.  
Porsche introduced the 912 in April of 1965.  "Okay, this is a real 
Porsche", conceded the 356 crowd.  At least the balance was better.  "Oh, 
no!" screamed the 911 followers, "That's a VW engine back there!"

Cruising into the very early 70's, Porsche threw another left turn into 
the market and introduced the 914.  Now, here is a car that everyone had 
something to complain about.  Not only was the engine a VW engine, but 
Porsche had the gall to use VW parts in other parts of the car!  Sound 
familiar?   Now, nearly everyone was in agreement, well, almost.

Later, that very decade, Porsche introduced two more models that helped 
make coronary artery disease the number one killer world wide.  It was 
named the 924 and the 928.  The 924 was designed to be a gift to VW, but 
a twist of fate brought the orphaned creature back to the front door of 
Porsche.  Cold and hungry, the 924 was taken back in and bore the name of 
Porsche after all.  "You can't do that!" cried the raging Porsche crowd.  
"The engine is in the wrong end!  And what is this, a radiator?"  True, 
the 928 was a hand made car, and the 924 borrowed Audi parts (yes, 
Porsche designed the engine, but was built by Audi), but no one worth 
their snobbish Porsche crest would call those cars a real Porsche, even 
when many a 911 driver had swapped ends in a turn, thus exiting engine 
first.  It was considered bad etiquette to let any engine precede you.

Even in the early 80's with the introduction of the 944, which, once 
again received glares from the "real man's Porsche" sect, simply refused 
to take root.

Now let's set the story strait.  Even with each introduction of a new 
model the automotive world embraced each design.  Porsche could do little 
wrong in some eyes, but they could not please all, mostly of their own 
clan.

Things began to settle in to a groove for a while, then in the 90's, 
Porsche did it again!  Enter the 968.  All new, almost, but it still was 
questioned by "true Porsche fans", whoever they really were.

By this time, the true identity of a "real" Porsche owner and what 
defined a "real" Porsche was more obscure than some individuals in the 
CIA.

By the mid 90's Porsche made an effort to "get back to their roots" after 
"branching" out in so many diverse directions.  This "stemmed" from the 
sagging sales of the current Porsche line and was the kiss of death for 
the front engine cars.  Hearing this, many expected the reintroduction of 
the Maus.  This was not to be.  Behold, the Boxster was born with all the 
glory and claimed blue blood heritage of a royal wedding.  Despite being 
a outstanding car, there was a group of anonymous people who secretly 
stood up and cried "Not so fast! That's not getting back to your roots!"  
What they were pining about was that Porsche's claims of the relationship 
of the Boxster, to that of the fabled 550 Spyder, was in reality closer 
to the 914-6.  Porsche had tried everything to divorce themselves from 
that connection to no avail.  It also borrowed engine technology from the 
968.   What was worse, was that it was water cooled, not air cooled!

As the 90's were drawing to a swift close, Porsche geared up to introduce 
a new version of the 911 that would take Porsche well into the next 
millennium.  Photos appeared in magazines all around the world.  People 
gasped at the new car.  The core of the Porsche family had been shaken.  
After over thirty years the legendary 911 was about to undergo a death 
rattle.  Thousands of "dyed in the wool" 911 owners cried "Thou hast 
committed sacrilege.  Thy offering is not air cooled!", shaking their 
raging fists in the air.  "Thou is ugly, thou shalt not be a true sports 
car!  Let it be known that this will be a dark day for Porsche, thou hast 
finally sunk to the depth of automotive purgatory.", were the murmurs of 
the depressed zealots.  Prozac sales soared.

Soon after, a distraught group of loyalists banded together.  They took a 
secret oath, and thus raised the spirits of those around them.  They were 
proclaimed as saints, and each, in turn, raised the sacred oil cooler to 
their lips and drank deep.  They pricked their fingers and all became 
blood brothers of the transaxle clan.  On the night of their departure, 
there was music and wine.  Their quest was called "The search for the 
Holy Grill".  They marched off into the dusty distance shouldering high 
the hopes of those left behind, but were never to be heard from again.

And so ends our story.  We have searched everywhere through time and 
space for the "real" Porsche, but nowhere could everyone agree to the 
identity of such a marque.  Perhaps it was only a myth, some dream, or 
maybe a rumor started by someone working for Ferrari who wanted to wage a 
covert battle amongst the Porsche clan.  History may never reveal the 
truth.  We have seen a myriad of models produced over the last several 
score of years, but each is endowed with questionable virtues.  Could 
there be a lesson here?  Is reality only what we perceive?  Does this say 
something about who we are, deep inside?  Is this a Zen thing?

Clearly, with each introduction of a new model, there were those with 
disfavor.  It is a human thing.

It has been said, that no one embraces change except a wet baby.

Someday, there will be a select group of people that will look back 
through the years and feel confident that the 996 was the only "real" 
Porsche.  Everything that preceded it was only practice.  This will exist 
only in their minds.  You can't order it at the store. There is no 
Porsche part number stamped on any microfiche anywhere in this world that 
was, is, or will be "real".  It will not be found in some religious hall. 
 Great wars have been waged to discover the truth, but it has always been 
just beyond our grasp.  Perhaps it is the waking moment, the fleeting 
instant, that we transition from our deepest sleep to morning stupor.  

The "real" Porsche.  It lives in your heart.  Intangible as it may be, no 
one can take it from you, unless you first surrender it.
