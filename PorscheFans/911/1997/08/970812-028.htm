Carroll Shelby Cobra To Be Featured At
                                    1997 Monterey Historic Automobile
Races

Monterey, CA. (December 9, 1996 - Laguna Seca Raceway, General Racing,
and Porsche Cars North America announced that Carroll Shelby and
Cobra have replaced Porsche as the featured marque at the 24th Annual
Monterey Historic Automobile Races, August 15- 17, 1997, at Laguna
Seca Raceway. 

This change allows the Monterey Historic Races to host two significant
automotive anniversaries in consecutive years. Next year marks the 30th
anniversary of Carroll Shelby and Ford's historic victory in the 24
Hours of LeMans. Two years from now, in 1998, Porsche celebrates the
50th
anniversary of the production of the first Porsche sports car. 

"We're quite pleased to step aside for one year to permit Carroll Shelby
to receive their well deserved accolades," said Frederick J. Schwab,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Porsche Cars North America. "At
the same time, we're grateful to General Racing for inviting Porsche to
stage its momentous 50th birthday party at the world's most prestigious
historic automobile races." 

"All of us associated with the Monterey Historic Races are very excited
about honoring Carroll Shelby and Cobra for the first time in our 24
year
history," added Steven Earle, President of General Racing. "This is
something we've been trying to accomplish for some time, and 1997
provides us
the perfect opportunity." 

"We're also thrilled to celebrate Porsche's 50th anniversary in 1998.
Porsche impressed everyone as our featured marque in 1982, and we're
certain
the activities surrounding its historic milestone will be even more
spectacular." 

Laguna Seca Raceway General Manager, Scott Atherton is very enthusiastic
about the change, "We are extremely honored to host a one-two punch
such as this," he said. "To have Carroll Shelby and Cobra then Porsche
in consecutive years is a dream come true. We look forward to working
with
everyone involved over the next two years to make both of these events
spectacular." 

The 24th Annual Monterey Historic Automobile Races take place August
15-17, 1997, at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, California. For
ticket information call 1-800-327-SECA or (408) 648-5110. 

Laguna Seca Raceway is operated by the Sports Car Racing Association of
the Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP), a non-profit organization
dedicated to promoting tourism in Monterey County and supporting local
charities. Since its inception in 1957, SCRAMP has donated over seven
and a half million dollars to more than seventy charitable organizations
throughout Northern and Central California, and is responsible for
hundreds of
millions of dollars in economic impact.
