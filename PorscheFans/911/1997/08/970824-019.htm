You have to remember that mail order capable businesses such as Tweeks get
many requests for catalogs and in order to keep costs down they must ship
them 3rd class and in bulk, which means they may only ship catalogs every 3
weeks.  I have waited a month for catalogs before too.  Tweeks comes highly
recommended by me though (as if that means anything).  I've found their
prices very reasonable and quality high as well.
