I wanted to relate a very pleasant experience with purchasing wheels from
Wheel Enhancement. I recently bought a 1987 911 Carrera, which I want to
use mostly for track events, but also on the street. For that reason, I
wanted an additional set of wheels to accomodate two sets of tires.

After looking around a bit, I called Wheel Enhancement. I spoke with
Robert Wood, and found him to be extremely forthright, helpful and
professional. I eventually ordered a set of reconditioned 16" Fuchs wheels
with polished lips and black centers. The wheels are absolutely beautiful,
and I couldn't be happier with the experience.

It seems that there is some confusion about where to find Robert Wood,
particularly since there is a company by that name. The true story is that
Robert Wood used to own "Robert Wood, Inc." and sold it to his half-
brother a number of years ago, with the intention to retire. He is no
longer affiliated with them in any way. A couple of years ago, he unretired
and started "Wheel Enhancement." I highly recommend the company to anyone
wanting to buy wheels.
