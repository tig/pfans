Starting another thread based on your answer....

I have an '86 Targa, and the ventilation sucks (that is, when the top is on :)
In particular, fresh air only comes in via the floor vents, or the windshield
vents.  Do newer ('87-'89) cars improve upon this?  And if so, is there any
way to apply those improvements to an '86?  What I'd like is for fresh air to
be able to come through the center/side vents in the dash!

Also, how is the tranny improved, that is, what makes it better?

This'll sound like a facetious suggestion, but it's really not.
Concentrate on finding an '87-'89.  They have the improved ventilation,
clutch and tranny that you really want anyhow, and your credit union will
(presumably) finance it for you.
