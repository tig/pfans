Hi Greg,

It's hard to diagnose your problems, but if I were you I'd take all the
little items you mention as motivation for rebuilding the whole system.

>4)  Will the simple caliper rebuild kits solve these problems?

That, plus replacing the four flexible hoses almost certainly will.  If
not, you'll at least know your calipers are in good order.  I'd also
rebuild the master cylinder while I was at it.  Then for all intents and
purposes you'd have a new brake system.

>5)  The factory workshop manual says "The brake calipers may be
>disassembled only when the O-rings between the caliper halves should
>develop a leak."  Does this only refer to separating the caliper halves
>and doesn't not apply to these caliper rebuild kits?

Right, this only refers to splitting the calipers and doesn't apply to the
rebuild kits.

>6)  What is the reason for the 20 degree piston alignment tool mentioned
>in the factory manual?  Do I need to be concerned about this, or can I
>align it by sight?

Ahah!  The mysterious 20 degree piston alignment specification.  There's
been a reasonable amount of discussion about this over the years, with a
thread as recent as a few months ago.  I think it serves two purposes. One
is to allow the rear edge of the pad to contact the disc first so there is
no binding, and second to eliminate squeal.  Alignment by sight is fine.
This isn't a precision adjustment.
