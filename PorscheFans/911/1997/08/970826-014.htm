Jonathan,

Can you provide more specifics like where you are, where the buyer "lives",
etc.  I hope you completed a bill of sale because it can show that you are
no longer the legal owner even though the car has not been re-registered.

I ran into a similar problem a few years back.  I sold a car and
immediately left the country.  I removed only the front tag because the
bolts attaching the rear tag were too rusted.  When I returned six-months
later, I had over $1000 in parking and other tickets being charged to me.
The purchaser never re-registered the car and kept driving on my now
expired tags.  I was released from half of the tickets when I proved that I
had a bill of sale for the car.  I guess this was a goodwill gesture
because the court would not rescind the other tickets and pointed out that
I should have removed the tags.  I requested copies of the tickets
including information about where the infractions occurred.  Ironically,
many of the tickets were issued in front of the owners house (which I did
not know previously).  One dark night, I drove over with tin snips and cut
the license plate off of the car.  Then I tracked down the owner and
demanded that she pay for the remaining tickets.  

If you have the buyers name, you might try calling directory assistance.
You could also report the tags as being stolen or for that matter the car
as being stolen.  The DMV may be able to track down the owner through other
registration record.

Good luck
