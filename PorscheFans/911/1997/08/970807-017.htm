I put new tranny oil in my 1981 911SC about 3 weeks ago.  I went with
Red line 75W90NS oil and put in the amount listed in my 911 spec. book. 
Now I have noticed that oil is coming out around the clutch lever arm
shaft and the hole in the bottom of the bell housing where the engine
and tranny meet.  It will start to drip out after I drive for a while,
then while it sits it will drip out for a little while and leave about a
2" diameter spot of oil.  Could the reason for oil coming into the
clutch area be because I put too much oil in and it is now being forced
through the seal between the clutch and tranny?.  Is there a bolt that
can be removed to see if the oil level is too high?  Prior to using the
redline the 911 never leaked oil! so I was wondering if the reline
synthetic has something to do with it, has anyone else had a problem
with leaks after using reline full synthetic oil?
