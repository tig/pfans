Having solicited and received a lot of very helpful advice on my
tensioner update project from the list, I wanted to write a quick update
on the now-completed project.

I purchased the parts from Foreign Intrigue - they aren't the cheapest,
but are close, and were recommended by several list members.  All the
parts arrived on-time, and I had no complaints.  The actual work took me
two evenings - I used tips from the list, and the Upfixin article as
reference info.  The biggest problems were getting the muffler off
(rusted bolts), and getting the old gaskets off.  Neither turned out to
be a serious problem.

The tensioners have been in now for a few hundred miles - no leaks or
problems, so I think I can call this a finished project.  Thanks again
to everyone for all the help.  And if anyone else out there is getting
ready for this project, I'd be glad to share whatever I know (now).
