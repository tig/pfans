so I'm living with it for now;"

I've gotten spoiled with my carburated race engines  (easy access to
everything) and my SCs lack of need for much work, but on the
carburated engines it is easy to take out the engine oil thermostat without
removing the engine.  Just take off 2 10mm nuts and lift it out.  The early
fiberglass cover does not cover this part.  I think the same is true on the
SC engine.  Of course, you  have to remove some of the induction
system to get back there.  And dropping the rear of the engine on a jack
after removing the two motor mount bolts helps a lot to get more access
to the front of the engine.  This method works to get at a leaking oil idiot
light sender.  Removing the big rubber connecting boot gains you some
access.  At most maybe you would also have to remove the air box or
the top part of the box  to get at the thermostat, no?  

If the fiberglass does cover this thermostat on the CIS cars (my memory
blanks on this one), then you'd have to take off the whole induction
system to get the cover off.  That, too, can be done with the engine in
the car, though it is a pain.

Replacing the trombone loop with some kind of real cooler should be on
the work plan for every one who has one.  Of course, if you have other
problems contributing to heat you should fix those.
