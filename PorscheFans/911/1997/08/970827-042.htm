BloombergP@aol.com asked:  "I have a 1976 911s with a 1982 sc motor
in it which is a lot of fun,but lately the front end seems to have alot of
play in it. The car is a weekend driver w/45k on it and it seems worse
everytime I drive it,so before I take it out again I need to get this resolved.
It also has a slight shimmy at 40-50mph."

Dear P:  I've got a 77 with an 81 in it, and I agree it is a lot of fun.  

You need to go out and grab your front tires at the top and push and pull
to get an idea of which side (or both) the play is to be found, and maybe
you can figure out some where it is  also - at the top, in the middle, or on
the bottom of things.  Or does it take side to side wiggling to elicit it,
pointing perhaps to steering.    Then jack up that side, get a jack stand
under the front (especially since you will be pulling on the car) and
remove the tire and look for the following various things which may be
loose (in no special order):

1) Front wheel bearings.  You can usually figure this out after jacking up
but before removing wheel.  grab top and bottom and wiggle.  There
should be a definite but very slight movement (play).  911 front wheel
bearings are looser than those on lots of cars (911 rear bearings, for
example, have no play at all).  If it feels like too much play, pry off the
dust cap and adjust the play.  See manual on this.  It's your chance to
see what the grease looks like in there too.

2) The ball joint at base of strut may be loose.  It is held to the strut with a
transverse bolt.  If this is loose there may be movement in the ball/strut
joining area.  tighten the pinch/jam bolt.  If it was loose for a long time it
may have hogged out the hole in the strut where the ball joint attaching
pin fits, in which case you probably need to get a used replacement
strut.  If the bolt was loose you might need to replace it. - by 76 I believe
it was a specially shaped bolt - one you won't find in a hardware store
or in your junk bolt box.

3) The ball joint may be loose where it attaches to the "A" arm.  It is held
on with a funny big circular "nut" which requires a special tool to
tighten/remove.  if just loose, have a shop tighten.  If this has been loose
long, it may have hogged out the hole in the A arm, or broken the tang
which engages the main ball joint assembly to hold it in place while the
nut is being tightened.  Fixing any of this will require some welding work.

4) The shock/strut insert is held into the strut at the top of the strut with a
kind of big hollow round headed flat topped bolt gizmo which threads into
the top of the strut and tightens down against the top of the shock
insert's body, with the shock piston rod going through the middle of the
gizmo.  This can come loose.   There is a spanner tool to tighten it, using
the two holes in the top of the gizmo.  No reputable mechanic would just
use a pipe wrench to tighten this because it will mar the metal, but a pipe
wrench sure works.  All of these first 4 possibilities can lead to feeling
excessive play when waggling a free front wheel with your hands.

5) to get at the gizmo nut in 4) you may need to remove the nut up under
the hood which holds the top of the strut insert onto the car so you can
lower things and remove the big cylindrical metal dust cap which
normally hides the gizmo from view.  I don't think this nut gets loose
much, or would cause a loose front end feeling even if it did loosen,
though it would affect the shock action some.  The front roll bar keeps
the front wheels from going to full droop if you jack the car up from the
side, and this in turn keeps (as I recall) you from being able to get at the
gizmo nut.  If you can raise the car up from the front, so both front
wheels are off the ground and want to droop and you get near maximum
droop, maybe you can get at the gizmo.  You can also remove the rear
sway bar mounts to help with this process.  I have always pulled the top
of the strut loose when dealing with this gizmo nut, but I have a different
sway bar than the stock for those years, and can just disconnect t from
the side I am working on to get everything low enough, etc.   

6) Your tie rod ends may be going, though they seem to last a long time. 
On Vws the test was to put the water pump pliers on the tie rod end and
squeeze the parts together (vertically).  If things moved enough that you
could see motion, the rod end was shot.  I suppose same is true on our P
cars.  The ends are replaceable.

7) The inner attachment of the tie rods to the rack and pinion is a sort of
rubber bushed half U joint (half because it is only designed for much
movement up and down).  These can wear out.  If so, replace with the
superior "Turbo" tie rods.  On my 77 in about 86 one of these was shot
(not that I had noticed this by driving the car - it was rotated 90 degrees
from its proper orientation, which was obviously wrong).

8) Rack and pinion could be worn (I doubt it at 47K) or its two mounting
bolts loose (also doubtful).  There is a hockey puck like rubber isolator in
the steering column.  Minute wear in fasteners in mine caused a
frustratingly hard to find little stick/slip in steering.  Fixing required
replacing the rubber, the steel spacer tubes, the bolts and washers, and
some other little parts as I recall - everything between the two mounting
flanges.  There are 2 U joints in the steeering column, but doubt they are
shot yet.  Also see recent discussion on the list of replacement of the
outer steering column bushing up closest to the steering wheel.  Your
car is about due for that, although the symptom is side to side play of the
steering wheel itself while sitting there stopped.  I can't say I noticed it
much in my car when this happened while driving.  It was sitting there at
a stop that bugged me. (for followers of that discussion, I used a VW
part which was recommended back in the days before Automotion
offered a part, and sounds like it was much the same as the 928 part
suggested - kind of corrugated semi-cylinder).

9) all of the movement of the front suspension is taken up with rubber
twisting (A arm mounts) or compressing/expanding (strut mount).  These
rubber parts can wear out (replacement is nowadays usually with
polyurethane bushings), but I'd put that pretty far down on the list for
play at 47K miles, if they lead to play at all.

Haynes manual should be adequate to help you with figuring out how
things go tegether and can be tightened or replaced here when you get
to that point.  You should be able to locate where things are loose if they
are loose by moving parts and observing closely.

See your wheel balancer about the shimmey if it is still there after you
have found something loose in the front end generally and have fixed it.

Good Luck
