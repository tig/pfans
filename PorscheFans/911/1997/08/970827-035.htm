I recently sold my 1985 1/2 944 and purchased a 1979 911SC with 73k miles. The car is
immaculate, and I have all the books and records. However, I have a couple of questions:
 
#1- My oil level gauge fluctuates wildly, falling to the top of the red zone on
acceleration, but rising to normal (center gauge level) while stopped. As the engine
warms up, the situation improves somewhat. I'll check the oil, engine warm and idling,
and I get a good reading on the dipstick. I'm not experiencing excessive oil consuption, 
and I don't have any leaks. Is this normal? By the way, oil pressure appears normal
(according to comments on this list) at appx. 1.5 bar per 1,000 RPM.
 
#2- The center-dash brake warning light is on all the time. I didn't have this problem
when I bought the car. I checked the handbrake switch adjustment and it appears okay. I
noticed that the PO had a spare Seatbelt/Brake light module laying in the glove box. I
plan on tracing the problem down this weekend. Where should I start? Could my two
problems be related?
 
Thanks in advance-
