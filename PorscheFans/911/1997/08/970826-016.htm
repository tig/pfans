    More or less, Marc... The Carrera 3.0's were R.o.W. ("rest of
    the world", i.e., not destined for the United States) cars whose
    engines were normally-aspirated versions of the turbo motors in
    the 930.  In 1978, the 911SC replaced the Carrera 3.0 and used
    essentially the same engine.

> Is this is a good, strong, reliable engine?

    Yeah, although if you're serious about keeping the car
    street-legal, you may run into emissions problems.

    Also, a few reliabilty improvements were made when the Carrera
    3.0 engine evolved into the 911SC... Larger bearings, an 11-blade
    fan, more-secure flywheel mounting, a fender-mounted oil cooler,
    etc.

> Do it have a magnesium crankcases(is that a problem)?

    No; like all the 930-based engines, it's aluminum.

> Could I get parts easily or is it an "oddball"?

    I'd guess that nearly all the engine parts are interchangeable
    with either the 930 or the 911SC... I'm sure that someone who
    has direct experience with the Carrera 3.0 can give you better
    information.

> Any idea as to what this car would be worth?

    Nope.
