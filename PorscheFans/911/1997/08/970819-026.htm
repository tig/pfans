Mike,

Thanks for your input.  I had one mechanic say that anything under 10% was fine.  That seems 
like you're loosing 10% of your engine's power, or maybe more since the operating presure will 
be much higher than the leak-down test's.

The mechanic that insisted on testing it cold said the following: 1-3% an engine in excellent, 
practically new condition, 4-6% good condition, a lot of life left, 7-9% showing signs of wear, 
better start saving for some engine work... maybe a couple years, 10-12% drivable, but you'll 
need some engine work to get the performance out of the car.  Do these comments seem reasonable?  
If these are cold readings how much better should the hot readings be?

This seems like a good test to have done before a purchase, but why is there so much difference 
in interpretation?  I really want to sort this out since I will soon be in the market to replace 
my 930 (looking for an '84-89 Targa).  

I was looking at an '86 Carerra with a leak-down of 6% (hot) and about 70,000 miles on it.  This 
car was being sold as excellent condition, and with a $$ premium attached.  I ended up deciding 
against it because it had a few annoying quirks, and the 6% made me question the perfect engine 
condition.  For a lower price maybe...

Thanks,

Tom
