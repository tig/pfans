Scott Cragin's loose steering wheel is, I'm pretty sure, a shot
steering wheel bushing.  I had the same thing two years ago.  You can
do it correctly by getting the factory part ($15+ from Stoddard), but
installing it is not easy.  You have to chip out the old bushing, and
it's a time-consuming job. 

There's a quick fix--a plastic sleeve sold by Automotion that,
paradoxically, is more than the factory part and much cheaper to
make.  That, I'm told, just pushes in.  I can't imagine it lasting as
long as doing it. correctly, but it's so much easier to do that some

people recommend it.  And that's why Automotion can sell it for an
outrageous price
The steering wheel nut is a big one (27mm), and it only comes in half-inch drive, so if you

As for aftermarket wheels, I have a Momo and it's very nice--smaller
diameter is good for tight corners.  If you're lucky you'll find a
Porsche button--the factory cracked down on those things some years
back.
