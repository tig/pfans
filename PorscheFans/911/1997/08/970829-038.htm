Dear All,
   Today I was going to get a new pair of tires put on
my back wheels, but when I tried to remove the wheels,
I broke off one of the lug nuts!  The other nine came
off easily enough but I destroyed my "softsocket" and
then snapped off my tool kit's 19mm lug wrench.  I've
had these wheels off before and always use a torque wrench
to retighten, so I know they weren't put on too tight.
I'm thinking that lack of neversieze on the mushroom ends
of the lug nuts (or in the "dished" hole of the wheel)
caused the nut to sieze to the wheel.  Anyway, the hex
part of the stud broke off clean leaving the mushroom part
of the lug nut still there.  I spent almost 3 hours very
carefully drilling through the lug nut right next to the
stud.  I had to drill many holes all the way around, as
the nut would not give till it was carved all the way!
I'm impressed!  What are those things made of?!!  Even as
light as they are, I can attest they are mightily strong!
The purpose of making this post is to advise all to use
some neversieze or similar in the "dish" where the lug nut
bottoms to the wheel.  I know I'm a believer!
I did get my new Dunlops on, but this wasn't the way to 
spend a day off.
