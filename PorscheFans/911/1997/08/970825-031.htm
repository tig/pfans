I asked about additional jack points for a floor jack last week and got 3
replies all saying to use the Automotion (or other source) jack plate that
slips into the hole for the factory jack on the sides.  For some odd reason, I
was at Automotion last week (earlier) and the sales guy talked me out of buying
the plate.

I wisely heeded the PF group advice and bought one of the jack plates and it
worked outstandingly well.  I can easily jack up each side of the car and slip
a jack stand under one or both of the factory jack points at front and rear
(each side).

My floor jack is one of those that comes with about a 6" diameter open concave
cup on it.  This is awful if there are only certain small points you can jack
(like on a 911, but on all our other cars as well).  This was not going to work
on the jack plate.  There was a thread a while ago about using a hockey puck to
use as a smaller and flat platform on a floor jack like this but in this area
of the country, I guess, hockey pucks (the *ice* kind) are not that easy to
find :-).

The cup slips into about a 1" diameter hole in the floor jack and is supported
by a roughly flat region about 3" in diameter (the cup, with its 1" diam post
sticking down, slides into this and rests on the flat region).  This area is
what I presume the hockey puck would rest on.

To substitute for the puck, I purchased a few galvanized pipe parts and made a
small, flat platform out of an inverted pipe flange also 3" in diameter.  Into
the thread of the pipe flange (which faces down), I added a pipe sticking down
into the hole in the floor jack for stability.  On top of the inverted flange
face I simply lay a piece of 3/8" thick neoprene rubber (I believe) -- hard,
black rubber cut to the diameter of the pipe flange.  (I got all the pieces at
the local big hardware store, including the rubber which comes in sheets.)  I
tried gluing the rubber to the pipe flange face but because of the lateral
forces it did not stick long.  No glue seems to be working just fine anyway.

I use this assembly now for all the jacking; the rubber conforms to the surface
being jacked and is tolerant of small angles and shifts.  This little assembly
fits the Automotion jack plate very closely, and the angle that develops when
you jack the car up is absorbed by the rubber.

Maybe a picture will help?
