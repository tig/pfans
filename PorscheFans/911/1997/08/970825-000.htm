 Hi Mr. Clardy,

 I have been writing Senators and the Governor on club stationary and get=

 Note the following is the letter that I will send:

 The Porsche Club of America is a enthusiast club with 38,097 members, ma=

of them in California. For our members with older cars (1966- 1974 Porsch=

the current California smog laws are creating a hardship. Many of the
1966-1974 Porsches are unable to meet the 2500 rpm emission standard due =
to
the original design of the vehicle's emission control systems. You would =

the National Technical Chairman I receive calls, faxes, e-mails and lette=

every week concerning the problems and expense that the current laws have

unreasonable to expect them to be able to retroactively comply now.

 I think that Senate bill SB42 (Kopp) concerning air pollution and the
exemption of these early cars or some legislation that will give relief t=

our older Porches and allow them to continue to be used is very important=

our members. I am sure that the owners of most of these older Porsches wo=
