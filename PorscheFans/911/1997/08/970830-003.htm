It's been my experience that alignment settings are pretty stable.  I do my
own alignments on my car and keep records of what the settings are - I
haven't seen them change appreciably over the years.

Negative camber and toe out up front?  Sounds interesting.  :>)  How
much negative camber?  1 degree? 2?  I would recommend about 1 to
1.5 degrees of negative camber and zero toe.  This should reduce
the wear somewhat and still work well on the street/track.

YMMV.
