Hello all,
   I am new here, so let me tell ya that up front.  I know my way around
a car pretty well.  I am thinking of purchasing a 911, and I know a good
bit about what I want, but I think it best that I consult a few of you
pros out there.  I have time to think it over as I am probably only
going to purchase towards the spring.  I am probably going to be looking
for something after around 1980...but I definitly want to go for a 3.0L
or 3.2L engine.  Probably going for the Targa body style.  I am going to
do some of this with performance on a reasonable budget (not going to be
a racer...just hopefully pretty quick.)
    Well...my real questions are things have to do with what things I
can do to such a car.  How well will the existing tranny handle more
power.  I know there are real limitations on what you can do with some
cars unless you beef up the rest of the drive train.  What kind of HP
can the existing drivetrain take before it becomes questionable?
    Another thing I am reading about is all of the replacement body
pieces of them.  It seems that after 1974, panels fit just about
everything up to almost the present.  Sounds like you can really
modernize the appearance of some of the older cars.  Is this truely the
case?  It's one of the things I like about the porsche 911's....they
seem to be really interchangable with parts throughout their years.
     Well...I must get to work...sorry this is rushed, but I was just
wondering if anyone had any preliminary info or things I should know
about.  One thing I can considering is adding a turbo...but my main
question is, is I'd like to know what turbos will fit what engines, or
will they fit most of them?  I have seen a few "lightly" used ones, and
the occasional reasonable new deal, but I wouldn't even know which would
work with a 3.0 or 3.2 for sure.  Like I said, at present my knowledge
is limited, but I'd really imagine most woul work with either...can
anyone enlighten me for sure?

Thanks for the input...more questions to come!  ;)

Jeremy
