To the Fan with the AC Stench,

I was flipping through some older car catologues and found in an Imparts =
catologue=20
that Wurth makes a "Air Conditioning and Heater System Treatment" . Says =
to spray in the vents and returns, wait a few minutes and the mildew =
smell will be gone. Continues to say that it doesn't maks odors but =
eliminates them at the source. Cost $22. That's kind of steep. Did you =
try the Lysol that someone suggested? If it worked, you can buy a lot of =
Lyson for $22. If it didn't work maybe this is the answer.

Imparts is located in St Louis, Mo.  Neet shop for those close by. =
800.325.9043 for those far away.
