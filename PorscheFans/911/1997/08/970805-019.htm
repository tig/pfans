Eric & P-fans:

Using a light (Aluminum) flywheel should present no durability problems
for your engine. We have used Tilton Engineering's 911 replacement 
flywheels since 1978 to help keep 6-bolt style flywheels from vibrating
off at RPM's over 8000 with good success. These are very durable units
that allow easier shifting and quicker throttle response.
  For street use, you may find that your car is a little more tricky to
get going from a standstill, especially on hills, due to lack of
"flywheel effect". With that warning in mind, you may make an educated
decision on whether its' for you. 911's that are used for track events
are more fun to drive with the light flywheels and the syncro's will
thank you for it.

Your second questions about modifications to a 2.5 retaining the MFI
are a bit puzzling. Making a 2.5 from a 2.4 will require using the 90mm
piston & cylinder set from the Carrera RS or custom pistons from JE. 
These units should have enough valve clearance to allow you to use "S"
cams or just retain your "E" cams. If you raise the CR and use the 
bigger cams, you might consider sending your FI pump to Pacific FI to 
make sure it is optimized for this combination. Using MFI on these
engines should not be a limitation. All it takes is $$ :^).

Hope this helps you, good luck!
