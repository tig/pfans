re-stitch?

Hi, I just finished restitching the leather around my 911-'86 steering wheel.
First go to your favorite bead store and buy string/thread that is the right
thickness and color and cannot be torn with your bare hands.  Often these
strings are lightly waxed, which is good.  You need at least 6 times the
lengths of the seams and then some. Also obtain 2 straight upholstery needles.

Before removing the rest of the old thread, look at the way the leather is
stitched.  Porsche uses a cross over stitch which is unlike your shoelaces
style (which I have seen on GM cars).  You start by threading the string
across at the beginning of the section, having the string now coming out on
top of the leather.  Even out the string length on each side and thread a
needle on each end. Now go crosswise above the leather to the next holes.
With each needle stich under and straight across, coming back out on the
outside of the leather.  Now you repeat this until you are done with a
section.  Make sure the stitching is tight after every crossover.  At the
end of the section tie the two ends of the string triple and don't forget to
put clear glue on the knot so that it stays.

Expect to spend several hours if you want to do a good job, especially the
first time.

I hope this helps.
