 I recently had a 60000 mile service done on my 1987 Targa with the usual
valve adjustment and a new clutch with service bulletin done. The car has
71000 miles. There was a great deal of discord between myself and the
mechanic. Not feeling comfortable with this mechanic I have been to three
other shops all of whom have said the clutch feels as if the pressure plate
is going bad and that the valves are too noisy. I felt very comfortable with
the last fellow I talked to. He said that even though this is an hydraulic
clutch there are several things that can be done to adjust it so that it
functions better and he too felt that the valves needed to be readjusted. I
know there is some adjustment in the pedal play of this clutch but are there
other things that can be done or is this a boon doggle? What reason could
there be for a brand new clutch to feel as if it is very worn? Thanks for
advice in advance.
