<pre>
I'm doing some proper planning, which means well in advance for once <g>.

I have a 1983 911SC Cabriolet with ~120000 miles.  At some point, I've got to
decide what to do when it is time for a rebuild of the engine.

My thoughts are running towards the following, so any input would be 
appreciated.

I know that the engine went to a longer stroke in 1984, so will my engine
accept a longer stroke crank and shorter rods?  This bumped from 3.0l to
3.2l.  They also added the DME engine control electronics.  I would like
to have these items in the car if possible.

I also know that in 1987 they moved to the G50 trans.  Will one of these fit 
in my car as well?  I realize this means new clutch, flywheel, and probably a 
host of other things I don't know about.

In 1989 they bumped the bore and lengthened the stroke again to achieve
3.6l.  Would later cylinders, pistons, rods and crank fit my block?  I also
see even larger bore kits w/ cylinders, pistons and rods, which would net
a 3.8l engine.  Same question again, would these fit my block?

Would I be better off getting a much newer engine & trans, and dropping it in,
instead of any of the above?  What are the thoughts?

As you might have guessed, I'm not really interested in trading up to a
newer car, I like the idea of having a first ever year for the cab, but I am
interested in some performance enhancements.  Of course, it may be cheaper
in the long run to buy another car...

Any input is welcome.
