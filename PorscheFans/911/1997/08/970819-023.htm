Sorry it took so long to answer you.  Hope others offered some help
in the meantime.

I have a 2.4S motor in a '69 coupe track car.  It has extra oil cooling.
There's a long story behind the mods I've made (and I can send it
to you if you like) but it doesn't affect you since most of the issues
were upgrading '69 parts to '73 parts or better.

For several reasons I try to run the oil as full as possible.  My target
for a while was to have the oil guage still pegged at the top when
the car was cruising at 3000 rpm and fully warm.  Fully warm,
outside of track conditions, means sitting on the 180=B0 mark where
the thermostat keeps it.  On the track it'll get up to 210=B0 or so.

The only effect I've seen from this approach, and this has happened=20
just once, is that it's possible to get oil into the cylinders when the
car is at rest.  As far as I can tell, this happens as oil drains from the=
=20
tank down into the crankcase.  There's not a lot of room down there,=20
and you can fill the crankcase enough that the oil will run along the=20
inside of a bore, seep past the rings, and get into the compression=20
chamber. =20

You'll notice this, if it happens, in one of two ways.  The most=20
benign effect is that the car will smoke like crazy, and will
keep doing this for a while, gradually returning to normal operation
after running about an hour or two.  The more extreme effect is that you
can hydrolock one or more cylinders.  This is when there is enough
(non-compressible) oil to keep the cylinder from moving up on its
compression stroke.  This will be noticed as an unwillingness to
turn over.  The likely fix is to use the fan housing to rotate the=20
engine backwards and push the oil out of the way (into the intake
or exhaust where it can create effect #1, lots of smoke for awhile).  If=20
you find a way to force it (like pushing or towing the car to bump start=20
it) you can bend a rod.  At least you can do that with most motors,
and I have no reason to suspect the Porsche motor wouldn't be
subject to the same fate.

As far as I can tell, as long as the motor is running, there is room=20
enough in the system (a little in the sump, a little in lines that might
otherwise drain themselves, etc.) for a lot of extra oil.  Remember to
get the engine thoroughly warm before checking the oil level, as
adding oil when the engine is cold will produce a too-full condition
once the oil heats up and expands.
