Jeff, thanks for reposting my old message (repeated below).  Saved me =
from having to dig out the info, as I had that message archived at work, =
rather than here at home.

Scott, the repair is really easy.  You can do it in about 30 minutes.  =
All you need is a screwdriver and the 27mm socket (available at Sears).

First just pull your horn pad straight off the wheel.  Disconnect the =
horn wire.  If you ground it, the horn will go off.  This exposes the =
27mm nut.

It's on pretty tight.  Make sure you or someone holds the wheel for you =
as you remove it.  I think there is a good chance of damaging the =
steering wheel lock if you rely on it to keep the wheel from turning.  =
Now mark the position of the wheel on the steering shaft so you can be =
sure to put the wheel back on the exact same splines.  The wheel should =
pull right off.

You now can see the remains of the green plastic bushing, unless yours =
has completely disintegrated already.  Use the screwdriver to push any =
remaining bits down the shaft.  Now just grease the new part lightly =
(probably not really necessary) and push it into place with your =
fingers.  Put everything back together and you're done.

Good luck!

>I just replaced the plastic bearing collar at the top of my steering =
column with the 928 part Bruce A. recommended here >and in Excellence =
(part 928.347.739.02).  It works great.
>This repair looks like it's good for life.  The 928 part is metal, not =
plastic like my original broken part.  It's about an inch long >bushing, =
the top edge of which is flanged to hold it against the bearing and keep =
it from falling down the column.  The part >is slightly oversize, but it =
has a narrow slot cut down it's length so when you install it, it =
compresses slightly so it stays in >place.
>I put some wheel bearing grease on it, and then easily pushed it into =
place using just finger presssure.
>The part only cost me $4.86 at the local dealer.
>Thanks Bruce!
