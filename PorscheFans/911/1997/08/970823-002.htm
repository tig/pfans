A clarification, based on what I saw in today's Digest:

The bushing in my car is metal with ball (or roller) bearings, not
nylon, and that's a '75.  The Automotion fix is plastic.  Maybe later
cars had a nylon bushing--I don't know.  Removing the original part is
the toughie--you have to start by drilling, then chipping it out.  My
response yesterday was garbled up in my crappy e-mail program (my
fault for not using Netscape for all my mail), and I apologize.

I thought it was a do-it-yourself job, and I went ahead, bought a 27mm
socket and a 3/8 to 1/2 drive adapter.  I ended up turning it over to
my mechanic, and he did the dripping and chipping.  You'll get two
answers from people--those who buy the Automotion fix (it's easy) and
those who do it correctly (it's not).  As I wrote before (perhaps
unintelligibly), Automotion has the part fabricated and charges more
for it than the factor
