I own a 1979 911 Turbo and I am experiencing a problem whereby once the
engine reaches operating temperature the car will stall unless the revs
are kept up. When the engine is cold the car will start straight away
and idle happily until the engine warms up. You can drive the car along
quite happily as long as you don't let the car sit there and idle. When
you are driving if you gear down and stop accelerating the car will
backfire also. In the event the car stalls it is very difficult to
restart but if you let the car sit there for 2mins it will start without
a problem but seeing the engine is still hot it will go to stall so you
have to keep the revs up. I have noted also that the exhaust fumes seem
to indicate that the car is running lean. If anyone can help it would be
greatly appreciated. 

Just a brief history I am in Melbourne Australia and I went and got this
car from California and imported it back into Australia. The car has
been converted to right hand drive. I had this same problem in the US
before I bought the car. 

Thanks
Stan.
