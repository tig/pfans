Hi guys!

I am a 944 Porschefan (and a new member of the 911 list) and need advice
on
selecting a suitable 911 project car.

I am now interested in purchasing a 911 with the
intention of "rebuilding" it for track(DEW) use(i.e. no interior, AC,
etc.)while retaining it's minimal street legal status. I would like to
end up with a well balanced car with close to a 10:1 weight(lbs) to HP
ratio.

I have been looking at a 1976 Carrera 3.0 coupe.  It has 45,000 miles
and is in "rough" shape(cosmetically and interior and paint).  The
structural elements appear to be good and it has no AC or sunroof. It
first appears as a good candidate for track.

I am confused as to what this engine really is (engine no. 930/02) (it
seems to be rare).

Is it essentially a 3.0 SC engine?

Is this is a good, strong, reliable engine?

Is this a good engine for track use?

Do it have a magnesium crankcases(is that
a problem)?

Could I get parts easily or is it an "oddball"?

Any idea as to what this car would be worth?

You're help and comments would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks.
