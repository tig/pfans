I had the same problem with my '76 911s and I
replaced all the same parts. Then I changed the mixture
setting so the car ran more rich, this seemed to
help so I went to a shop so that I could check
the mixture with a CO meter.  The tag on the
engine says to set the CO to 2-4%. My first
adjustment had brought it to 3% then I set it
at 4.5%.  The problem has gone away.  The
mechanic who set the mixture suggests that
perhaps I need a new fuel pump.  Someday
I will put a pressure gauge on the CIS and
check pressures, and also try to do a more
thorough check for leaks.
