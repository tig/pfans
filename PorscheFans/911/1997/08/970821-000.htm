Paul:

Hmm... I guess that the fact that neither of my cars has a ferrous
body (the Porsche's is fiberglass and the Honda's is aluminum)
probably goes a long way toward explaining why I've never had a
problem with rust appearing under the Rust Avenger primer.

Thanks for the info; I'll keep it in mind if I ever have to repair 
chips in the wife's truck.
