I see stainless steel braided brake hoses for sale in both DOT approved and
non-DOT approved versions. Can someone tell me the difference? 

I had put stainless steel on my previous car ('86 911), but I also changed
pads to REPCO at the same time, so it would be hard to get a true comparison.
FYI, I preferred the feel of the factory pads over the REPCO pads.

As my car is an '85, I'm thinking I should change the hoses as a preventative
measure when I flush my fluid this winter. I seem to remember reading
somewhere that stainless steel hoses were only recommended for race cars that
are subject to frequent inspection, and that the stock hoses are better for
street cars.


TIA
