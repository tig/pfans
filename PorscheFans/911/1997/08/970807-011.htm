Tim:

Am in the process of going thru' the same here.  At first, I made the mistake 
of going to a gas station because I'd a coupon for 17.95 + cert for the smog.  
My new 74 P came out as a "Gross Polluter (GP)" with excessive HC levels at 
idling.  Once the computer reads this as a GP, it then records this on the DMV
computer and you can only go to a "Green Station" for subsequent tests 
for 2 years !

If you feel apprehensive about your P smog here's some things to do:

1.  Conduct a pre-test at the smog station (this does not xmit the test results
    to the DMV computer).
2.  Take it to your mechanic to see if he can perform the test for you.
