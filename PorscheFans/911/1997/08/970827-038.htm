#1- My oil level gauge fluctuates wildly, falling to the top of the
red zone on acceleration, but rising to normal (center gauge level)
while stopped. As the engine warms up, the situation improves
somewhat. I'll check the oil, engine warm and idling, and I get a good
reading on the dipstick. I'm not experiencing excessive oil
consuption, and I don't have any leaks. Is this normal? By the way,
oil pressure appears normal (according to comments on this list) at
appx. 1.5 bar per 1,000 RPM.

Scott-
I'm also an ex-944, current-911 owner, and this scared the hell out of
me at first..  The level does fluctuate and this is normal.  Here is
my amateur description:   As revs increase, more oil is being sprayed
into the engine, and the tank (sump?)  level falls.  As a rule, trust
the dipstick more than the guage, and only expect meaningful readings
from the guage  when the car is on level ground, warmed up fully, and
idling.  Mine is fairly accurate under these conditions.
