Rick,

I don't believe there was much of a difference between the 1987-1989
carrera's, which are considered to be the last of the classic 911.  There
is a rather large difference from the 1986 and earlier cars however.  If
you don't have it already, pick up the August 1997 issue of EXCELLENCE.
Bruce Anderson gives a market update of the 911-1974 to 1989.  If you can't
get it, let me know and I'll fax you the article.

In 1988, I believe they made the 16" fuchs standard with 205/50 and 225/50
on the front and rear respectively.  That's what I have on my '84 targa.
All of the cars in the time frame you are looking at should be completely
rust free.  I wouldn't look twice at car with rust because once it starts
it's hard to stop.  Make sure you have a qualified Porsche mechanic give
the car a detailed prepurchase inspection.  I can't stress that enough.
Repairs on a Porsche are NOT cheap.  Valve guides seem to be a potential
weakness in these cars as my car has 95K miles, and I'm getting ready to
replace guides.  Just to give you an idea, to do a top end rebuild, you're
looking at $2000 - $3000 depending on how much you have to or want to
replace.

Take your time to find the best car you can afford.  It will be well worth
the wait.  Good luck!

Bob
