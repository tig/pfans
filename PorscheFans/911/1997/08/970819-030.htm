The differences between hot and cold leakdown will give indications 
about these two conditions and, IMHO, can both be useful.  If one is 
really bad, there probably isn't much chance the other will be OK, but 
a cold test will reveal current starting problems or ones down the 
road.  The factory manual is filled with blurbs about trouble-shooting 
engine problems which always first assume you have a mechanicly correct 
engine (i.e. good leak-down/compression).  Otherwise, the first domino 
has fallen and you might not realize you're mistakenly getting caught 
up in the  fuel?/air?/spark? thing.

People will differ about relevant leakage numbers.  For street use, I 
don't think any numbers under 10 percent are bad.  Reaching in a pocket 
for 3000-8000 dollars to fix one, or two cylinders at 12 and 15 percent 
may be a little frivolous, too, again....another humble opinion.

It doesn't take much to produce a lot of leakage, usually around the 
valve seat and, to a lesser extent, the rings.  When I took my engine 
apart, I was reminded about how a wind instrument plays awful when a 
small amount of air leaks out around the closed holes and how a music 
shop repair person would use a small light dropped down inside to 
detect these leaky areas.  Sam holds true for a 911 head.  To the naked 
eye, an old one may appear to have a nice dark valve seal, but put a 
light in the intake and you might be surprised.
