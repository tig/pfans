Greeting P Fans
The old paint on my 72 Targa has just about had it.. AS I am moving to
Jacksonville FL in the Fall from here in Monterey, I'm hoping to either do
some of the work myself, or find a shop that is reaonable there.  Anyone
familiar with any reputable shops near Jax?  How hard would it be to do the
work myself?  I'm not looking for concours, just a nice daily driver. 
Also,
in the interest in saving a few bucks, how important is removing the glass,
i.e., can I get away with leaving in the back glass and windshield?  
Just for the info, I recently attended Bruce Anderson and Jerry Woods one
day
911 tune up and maintenance class in Sunnyvale.  A fantastic experience and
full day of talking, touching, and breathing Porsches!!!

I took all the parts off my 1970, and found a lot of minor rust spots that
would have ruined a new paint job.  This is on a relatively rust-free
example.  If you are sure there are no lurking rust spots, you can tape and
spray with good results.  The job will last a lot longer if you spend more
time getting ready.  The UV and humidity are intense in Jacksonville.  Be
sure to specify a good brand of paint.  Cheap stuff looks great the day you
pick the car up, but will leave you miserable within two years.  My Chronar
job still looks great eight years after the paint job.  Will probably go
another ten years before needing serious attention.  Well worth the extra
money.  BTY, my Florida friends with Porsches report that most shops are
rip-offs.  Shop carefully.
