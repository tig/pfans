I'm a little confused on leak-down tests.  I just had one done on my 1980 930 Turbo, for the new 
owner.  It came out 2-3% and was tested cold.  The mechanic (which I hadn't used, but seemed 
like a very knowledgable guy) said if it was tested hot that the numbers would come out much 
better.  He said it shows how tight the engine is without the rings being expanded, and having 
oil up in the engine.  He insisted that the car be dropped off the night before so it would be 
"stone cold".

I had a leak-down done on a car that I was thinking of purchasing, and my mechanic said it has 
to be tested hot.  "If it's not hot, the rings haven't expanded and that's how the engine will 
be run.  Who cares how much it leaks when it's cold as long as it's good when it warms up."  
This car was an '86 Carerra and it came out at 4-6%.

Both mechanics had their reasons, for hot verses cold.  Which is right, and how will the numbers 
vary from hot to cold?  Also what readings are considered good, and at what point do you walk 
away from the car, or at least figure you're looking at some engine work down the road?

Input greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom

Porsche-less  :(
