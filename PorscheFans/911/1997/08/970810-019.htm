"Greeting P Fans
The old paint on my 72 Targa has just about had it.. AS I am moving to
Jacksonville FL in the Fall from here in Monterey, I'm hoping to either do
some of the work myself, or find a shop that is reaonable there.  Anyone
familiar with any reputable shops near Jax?  How hard would it be to do the
work myself?  I'm not looking for concours, just a nice daily driver. 
Also,
in the interest in saving a few bucks, how important is removing the glass,
i.e., can I get away with leaving in the back glass and windshield?  ..."

A trick I was taught years ago to keep from having to remove windows and 
avoiding the tell tale painted tip on the rubber trim involves a bit of time, 
but is effective.  Using a credit card lift the trim away from the sheet metal 
and stuff heavy cord or butchers' string up under the rubber.  This is to 
create some clearance between the metal and the rubber.  Then when masking 
wrap the tape around the tip of the rubber trim.  You can now sand the paint 
under the rubber and achieve a better than average repaint job.  The back 
window of a Targa presents some additional challenges, perhaps someone else 
has first hand experience with this.
