I had a similar problem with my '87 Targa (the Targa part has nothing to do
with it). Anyway, the DME relay was not at fault, but rather corrosion on
the DME circuit card. I discovered the corrosion when I did circuit surgery
to replace blown drive transistors for my idle motor (can't remember the
exact name of the thing, it's a rotary solenoid that meters bypass air on
the throttle body). Anyway, while I was in there I cleaned the grody salts
off the PC board and never had a "wiggle-the-DME-relay" hard hot start
again.
