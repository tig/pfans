My '84 Carrera just developed a new quirk ...

At idle, both the oil pressure and brake wear idiot lights come on, and
go off, together. Sort of a flicker which follows the small variations
seen on the pressure gauge at idle.

Oil pressure and level are both fine, and the lights go out as oil
pressure increases when I advance the throttle slightly off idle. The
idle is set at something just below 1,000 RPM. The pressure at idle
reads [approx.] 1.5 bars & increases to 5-6 bars [approx.] with increase
in RPM. There appear to be no changes in gauge readings with the
occurrence of the idiot light phenomena.

Engine is stock with 82k miles.

I don't understand the connection between the brake and oil pressure
indicator circuits. Perhaps that's the point, and there shouldn't be,
indicating a short someplace(?)

Ideas & recommendations as to cause & cure would be greatly appreciated,
posted here or replied directly to mhald@mail.dec.com.

Thanks,
        mark
