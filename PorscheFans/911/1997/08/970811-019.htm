I have the underbody condensor on my 77 911 and it does help get the air
cooler.  Even in FL it can get the air *cold*.  I do also have a multiple
piston compressor (almost as good as a rotory) and the double row condensor
on the engine cover.  The underbody condensor has no fan - so it only
really effective when you are moving.

According to my wrench - you can jack the car up with it.  I have not, nor
do I intend to try it, but I do trust him.  I have never had it drag on
anything, but my car has not been lowered.

One thing that I have found that helps on my car to increase the flow of
the cold air into the car is to diconnect the hose feeding the two slit
inlets and just let them hang down pointing at the seats.  It really puts a
lot more cool air in the car per unit time.

I have just ordered the bulkhead vent & am planning to make a
hole/installing it for it as soon as it arrives.
