      Marc,
     
     I own a 76 3.0 Liter Carrera and love it.  The 3.0L Carrera was the 
     top of
     the line normally aspirated 911 available in model year 1976.  The 
     engine is
     basically the same as the turbo, sans the turbocharger of course, 
     hence the
     930/2 designation.  There were only about a thousand of them made and
     another thou or so in model year 1977.  Porsche then took the body 
     style and
     the 3.0 liter engine, albeit detuned a bit, and produced the SC 
     beginning in
     1978.  The 76 3 Liter produces 200 hp and the 78 SC 188.
     
     If this car you're looking at is a true Carrera the VIN should be 
     something
     like 91166XXXX.  
     
     Also the dash has NO vents for air at all.  There is one
     tiny vent on each side about even with the ignition switch primarily 
     tothrow a little defrosting air on the door windows.  Therefore AC was
     standard equipment.  The AC unit sits under the dash and extends all 
     the way
     from one side of the car to the other.  It actually does a better job 
     of
     cooling the car than some of the newer models.  At least it moves a 
     lot of
     air.  I have replaced the old York compressor with a rotary and 
     installed a
     terbatrol  oil cooler which helps keep the temp down, in the car and 
     the
     engine compartment.
     
     I would say that the engine is fairly bullet proof.  It did have the 
     chain
     tensioner problems as did all earlier 911s.  I got to buy a new engine 
     right
     after purchasing the car (it was about 6 years old) because of the
     tensioners failing.  Unfortunately I didn't know what a failed 
     tensioner
     sounded like so I blasted right through it and the engine died a 
     terrible
     death.  The new engine came with the oil fed tensioners so I don't 
     expect
     that to happen again.  I now have about 125K miles on the car and no 
     real
     problems to report-and I drive it real hard.  I do need a new clutch 
     though.
     It was slipping a little when I dropped the clutch at 6000 RPM during 
     the
     drag races at the Parade.  If this didn't blow it up I think it is 
     pretty
     strong.
     
     Also the motor came with a 5 bladed fan with a smaller pulley to run 
     it a
     higher speed.  This was OK for Germany with al the Autobahn driving 
     but is
     not so good for our type of driving.  I changed it out for an 11 
     bladed fan
     for the extra low speed cooling.
     
     Since the engine is basically the same as the SC there is not much 
     trouble
     getting parts for it.  Same for the body etc.  there are some internal
     differences, cams etc, but even if the original part was not available 
     a
     substitute certainly would be.  I haven't had any trouble.  It seems 
     most
     parts people are familiar with the 3.0L Carrera (or at least profess 
     to be).
     I always mention what it really is, just in case there is some 
     difference.
     So far everything I've bought has fit and is working well.
     
     Hope this helps.  If I can answer any other questions fell free to
