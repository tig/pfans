Greetings from 'down under' folks.  I would like some information and
opinions on a 71 911 E 2.2 dilemma I am currently facing.

The background is that it appears that my Bosch mechanical fuel
injection pump (not to be confused with the electric feed pump) has
decided to stop working (mid corner on a time trial !).  There is nobody
in Australia who rebuilds / calibrates these who has had any level of
success (including Bosch).  I would like to know if 

a) Do any of you folk know where I can buy a reconditioned (or new) 2.2
E injection pump?
b) Has anybody had a pump of this age rebuilt and if so, by whom, and
how successful?

I am also looking at the throttle bodies as well so information as to
where I could source those from would also be useful.

I know that I can buy a Weber 40 IDA conversion kit out of the US for
much less than I can buy the bits I would need over here to completely
renew the intake system.  I would like some opinions on converting the
car to Webers.  Let's assume for the moment that I don't want to keep
the car original (sacrilege!).

a) How will this affect the car in terms of power output etc
b) If I am going to do this conversion should I be looking at a
different Weber?

As always the help from the '911 Brains trust' is greatly appreciated.

Azim
