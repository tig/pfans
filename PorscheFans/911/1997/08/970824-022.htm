I just wanted to thank everyone for the response that I have been getting to
my post about my locating and brokering service.  I never expected that many
people to write to me so soon!  If any one missed my original post I will
reiterate.  My name is Brian Buxton and I own my own business of auto
locating, brokering, detailing and performance upgrades.  I am a legitimate
business- a corporation -and although I specialize in Porsche and
Mercedes-Benz, I can find just about anything.  I've sold $3,000 Toyota
Celicas and delivered $100,000 Ferrari's.  I am a small, one-man business,
which translates into low overhead, low fees, and very personal service.  I
can even fly out to inspect/deliver your car to your doorstep or just set up
a pre-purchase inspection and delivery for your new auto. I do require a $50
deposit to cover any long distance phone charges that are made while locating
your car (in the event you change your mind about purchasing from me), and
the remainder of the fee is based on the level of my involvememnt in your
purchase.  I guarantee that my charges are more reasonable and mu services
better than any other locating service you will find!  Once again, thanks for
the responses and the business.  I hope to assist many more of you in the
future.
