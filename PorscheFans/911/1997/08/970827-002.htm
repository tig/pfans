Greg:

First, no your not crazy.  You may get some "crazy" looks as the 911
drives down the snow-packed road, but you have to try it!  I live in NH
and have driven my '87 Carrera through two New England winters -  I've
even got a picture (somewhere) of my 8' Xmas tree tied onto the roof and
whaletail to transport it home.  I REALLY got crazy looks on that one!!

Ah, but back to the point.  The 911 has the weight in the proper end
(over the rear) and with 4 snow tires (I use Blizzaks), the car will do
very well in almost all conditions (never been stuck while others
are!!). Some things that you will notice are that your cornering speed
will (and should) drop significantly as the Blizzaks will roll over
their "squared" edges under hard cornering - a weird feeling when it
first happens.  Road noise form the tires increases substantially and
gas mileage (because of the tires and rolling characteristics) drops
about 2-3MPG on the highway.

In so far as heat - the car has better heat in winter then A/C in summer
- but the defroster is SLOW and during hard snow/sleet, has a hard time
keeping up - but I've found opening either window about 1/2 inch
improves circulation and then the defrost typically works just  fine.

Also, I strongly recommend after a storm (when salt is used) take the
car to a self - serve high-pressure car wash and get inside the wheel
wells, undersides and hard to reach places with the high-pressure
nozzle. I haven't got a lick of rust anywhere as I've done this weekly
during winter months.  A word to the wise though - DRESS WARMLY when you
do this. The freezing spray from the nozzle is COLD.

Greg, enjoy the winter. My experience is that I'll take my 911 over
almost any other winter car I've driven including numerous BMW's, two
Audi's and misc. other stuff... and just wave back when you get the
crazy looks.
