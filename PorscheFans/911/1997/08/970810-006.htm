Hi P-fans,

The facts: 1978 SC, 85,000 miles, no tail, Speedometer is off so mph is =
actual by transmission graph
in owners manual, Air conditioning not in use.

I just completed a 780 mile trip and have questions about the oil temps.

On the first leg 367 miles the following occurred. At 75  mph (3225 rpm) =
my temp gauge was
horizontal.  Outside air temp was approx 70 degrees.  Does this sound ok?

Later, cooler outside air temps, around 63- 67 degrees,  a 95 mph  cruise=
 brought the oil temp  to
just under the 10:00 position.  2 hours of consistent 90 mph  plus =
driving the temp was at the 10:00
position so occasionally I decelerated to 85 mph (3500 rpm) to decrease =
the oil temp. A few minutes
at plus 105 mph caused the oil temp to hit the 10:00 position, maybe a =
tad higher.  After
decelerating the oil temp would decrease.  Do these temps seem normal in =
these operating conditions?

On the return journey, outside air temp was 82 degrees and humid, I =
pegged the actual mph at 75
(3225 rpm) the oil temp settled at 2 millimeters above horizontal.  At =
night the OAT cooled and the
oil temp decreased to 1 millimeter below horizontal.

Oil burn was approx. 1/3 quart for the entire 780 miles. =20

I am installing a numeric oil temp gauge face soon.  To alleviate =
carrying so much heat should I
consider an oil cooler?  What are the expected heat decreases and draw =
backs of the fender mounted
oil cooler?

Thanks for your attention.
