Subject: Brake fade/upgrade?

Hi P-fans,

Just got back Sun from our annual trek to the Glen.  Had a blast!

 I had to pump twice to get a firm pedal at the end of the straights and
my pedal travel has increased a lot before I get brakes, not a secure feeling.
Any ideas on the sponginess?   What are the symptoms of a failing 
master cylinder?
Brake pedal bushings? Are the pads more likely to fade as they wear down due t
o less heat sink capability?   I know I'm overbraking more than I should.

I have '88 Carrera brakes on my '74 front/rear with new Ate Super Blue,
bled once between runs and Cool Carbon pads worn 75%.    My homemade cool
brake vent from the front spoiler is not installed yet.

Anyway, I'm considering upgrading to either early 930/951 or any other
4-pot caliper brakes.   Anyone out there done this conversion?  Doug
Arnao from VCI was there and said the 930 calipers need to be machined
to fit with stock 930 rotors in the rear while the fronts were custom 
rotors due
to the 930 spindle being different.  Machining the rears cost $400 and the
trick front rotors cost $700, not counting the cost of the calipers and the
rear rotors, so we're talking $2k+ here.  I'm looking for less expensive
options - Wilwood, Alcon??

Also, I run 15x6 Fuchs on the street and 15x7 cookies for track.
Will the big calipers require 16" wheels?  If so, I need to factor
the total cost before I do anything.

Anyone BTDT, please respond with costs and mods required.

Thanks,
