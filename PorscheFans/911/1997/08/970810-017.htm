It's been years since I had a distributor on my '72, but I believe you
have vacuum retard on a stock S distributor in '73.  I think it is
mainly for emissions control and only retards about 5 deg at idle.  Make
sure the vacuum line is plugged going to the motor -- you don't really
need it.  Perhaps your points have lost their setting (not tight enough
when set) or the distributor shaft is worn enough to cause a fluctuation
in dwell.  Tell us a bit more about how it runs, 'cause it could be
something else entirely....

To both of you,

My '73 S has Weber 40IDA carbs (came to me this way).  About 8 months after I 
bought the car it started to die at idle with fair consistentcy.  We worked 
with PMO (Pano advertiser) who talked us thru jetting and venturi set up to 
run the car on the street, but threw up their arms at our foot dragging on 
changing the distributor to a European Carrera distributor, which does have 
vacuum retard (advance ?).  We finally tracked one down and cured the car's 
ills.  In fact I still remember my awe at being able to throttle steer my way 
thru my next Autocross.  A casual look reveals the # 030 on the base of the 
distributor.  We did this work in '85... I suggest you call PMO.
