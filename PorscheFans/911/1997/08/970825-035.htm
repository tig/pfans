I too live in York, PA. I own a black/black C2. Your question is also of
great interest to me, for I I had thought of posting an almost similar
message to the list a short while back. Since any of the responses that you
receive will most likely be sent directly to your e-mail address rather than
copied to the list, I would be very appreciative if you would forward any
responses that you receive on to me.

The company Translog that you refer to, 619-635 West Polar Street in York, is
owned by a gentleman named Gary Wigglesworth, - ph: 717-846-1885. I visited
his shop not too long ago to see if he would do the routine service, adjust
the valves, change the oil, etc. on my C2. From my tour of his place, the
cars in the shop, and our conversations it was my interpretation that his
love and main body of work is on 914's. He also seemed to have a steady diet
of 924/944's. Many of these were in for restoration purposes, which I believe
is probably more his specialty than as a service shop, and the restoration
work I saw appeared excellent. While I'm sure he has worked on numerous
911's, I saw few there- none of them "recent" year. He admitted to me that he
just doesn't see any C2/C4's since there just aren't that many in the
surrounding area. His familiarity with your year 911 I couldn't answer, but
by your living in York you also realize that there just aren't many 911's
around period. Nonetheless, I asked him for an estimate to do the routine
maintenance. He said he would fax an estimate over, but he never responded.

My impression of the facility itself is that it was both very dirty and very
cramped. I tried to envision where he would put my pristine second limb when
he worked on it and the only image I could see was getting a door ding. In
fact, as crazy as it sounds I don't ever remember seeing a lift in the
facility. I inevitably decided not to have him perform the work on my car.
None of this is meant to imply that he wouldn't do a good job or would harm
your car in any way, I'm only giving you my impressions and opinions. I'm
sure there are others on the list that could give you first hand reports on
dealing with him (anybody on the list care to weigh in?). Above all, I
suggest you visit him and decide for yourself.

I have been taking my C2 to the local Porsche dealer, Autohaus in Lancaster.
Although normally apprehensive about feeling gouged by a dealer, I have so
far been very pleased with them. Perhaps being in a "small town" helps, as
they have been very willing to work with me. For instance, I  needed a rear
wheel bearing and a torn CV boot replaced and also wanted the routine
maintenance performed. They tore apart the wheel and determined that I had
waited so long to replace the bearings that it had destroyed the hub, and
that the CV joint was bad. Rather than purchase new parts, I ordered a
complete axle assembly from a bone yard in CA. Autohaus let the car sit on a
lift for seven days while the parts were delivered, then promptly installed
them when they arrived- and did not charge me any extra for allowing me to
source out my own used parts nor for the time delay, even though they lost
the potential for the parts sale. They were also very good at calling me to
inform me of the situation, calling to let me know when the parts arrived,
when the work would be performed, and when the work was finished. They also
saved all the pieces they ripped off the car for Show and Tell. They will
also provide an estimate prior to any work.

The parts department is also very good. One of the guys in the parts
department told me that Autohaus made a decision a few years ago that they
wanted to be competitive price wise on Porsche parts- and therefore lowered
all their parts prices. When I called around in the above scenario for a new
hub, new CV boot, bearing, etc. from Automotion, ads in Excellence, etc. the
Autohaus prices were either cheaper or in line. I don't have any affiliation
with them whatsoever, just my experience. Nonetheless, If someone on the list
can turn us on to a good mechanic at good prices I'm always interested......
