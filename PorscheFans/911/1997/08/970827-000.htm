My car is black on black, so the standard black and white gauges fit in 
well with the general color theme; they also appear very functional.  I 
supposed if one had a colored interior or exterior, matching gauge faces 
might be OK.  I'd have to see it, however.

Now what about colored seatbelts?  I saw a black/black 993 at the 
dealership with red front seatbelts.  (Can't remember if rear were also 
red.)  I thought that was a nice contrast.  I think the Porsche option list 
includes red or yellow seatbelts.  Opinions on this?

Subject: 	colored gauge faces

hello,

I was talking to my dealer about colored gauge faces and he said that for a
mere(!) $1000 he could have aluminum faces installed on a 993. needless to
say, that seemed a little high.  however, looking through Excellence at the
ads in the back, i found a company that you could mail order faces from (nr
automobile accessories  nrauto.com). anyway, they charge ~$240 (without
installation).  does anybody have colored gauges or any experience with 
this
(or other) manufacturers?  is the work difficult to do yourself, or better
off leaving it to a good shop?
how about any general ideas/feelings about colored gauges at all. are they 
a
bad idea? everybody happy with white on black...

thanks
jim
