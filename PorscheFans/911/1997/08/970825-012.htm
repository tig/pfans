Many thanks to Jeff for pointing me to the Panorama issue which =
describes what I [and others] have been seeing. I checked the wiring =
diagram in my Haynes manual and, sure enuff, it shows a connection =
between the sensor side of the oil pressure warning light and a solid =
state module which drives the brake warning lights. I can't tell much =
about the ss module but, apparently, when the oil pressure switch  =
closes, it's meant to turn on the e-brake warning light, as well. I also =
note that this combo comes on when the ignition is first turned on, =
before starting.=20

Given the fact that this only occurs when the oil is at full operating =
temperature, and that the oil pressure gauge indicates normal pressure =
when the warning lights flicker, I've decided to trust the pressure =
gauge until I can get at the pressure switch & replace it.

Again, thanks to all who responded!

Mark ;

This is similar to a situation covered in the August '97 issue of =
Panorama (page 86) in Bruce
Anderson's Tech Q&A.

The oil pressure idoit light switch is used as a source for checking =
voltage for the brake circuit.=20
To quote; "When the oil pressure switch goes bad it not only turns on =
the the idiot light for the
oil pressure, but also the brakes.  Put in a new idoit light switch.  =
That  is the one at the rear end
of the engine (the end with the flywheel) up by the engine breather back =
there."  The article
goes on to caution that a brake warning should be attended to until you =
are sure that you have
found the problem.

Hope this does the trick.
