My $0.02 on the subject...

First, I agree with Chris Woodward's sensible views.  They echo my own.

Second, as some seem to think,  leakdown is **not** the
percent of power that is lost.  A
10% leakdown does **not** mean you are losing 10% of your power.  I'm
not even sure that anyone has ever really calculated the relationship
leakdown and power loss.  It's not that simple to do. For example, it will
depend on where the leak is occuring --intake?  exhaust? rings? some
combination?  It will depend on cam grind -- how long are the vavles
actually
closed?  The list goes on.  I am certain that someone, somewhere has
made measurements on a dyno that would establish an empirical relationship
between leakdown and power loss, but I've never seen anything like that
published.

There's a lot of popular wisdom associated with leakdown figures. Everyone
seems to have their own scale of acceptability.  There's no question that
smaller numbers are better, but 3% vs 5%, or 5% vs 8%, is splitting hairs.
My feeling is that in a street car you will never know the difference (if
there really is one) with 5-10% leakdown as opposed to 1-2%, in a few
cylinders, or maybe even all cylinders.  The power loss with numbers like
these is
insignificant.  Further, the test itself is not that repeatable.  Try it.
You might get 5% on a cylinder one day, and 10% on another.  Someone on
the list was concerned about 6%.  I wouldn't be.  20%, yes, but 6%, no.

Then there's the question of the leakdown tester itself.  This issue has been
raised many times on this list and on p-philes.  The tester has an orifice
of a certain diameter and length, both of which determine the reading you
get.  I may be wrong -- goodness knows I often am -- but I have not seen an
SAE standard
or something like it for the orifice dimensions, which means different
testers might give different readings.  If the test is used as a diagnostic
tool to determine where the leak is coming from, or as a means of keeping track
of engine condition over time, **using the same tester**, then it doesn't
matter. But it might matter when comparing cars tesed with different
testers, or when trying to use small differences in the absolute number as
an indicator of engine condition.

As far as warm vs cold leakdown is concerned, the most meaningful reading
is with a warm engine, the condition under which it is used.  Leakdown
figures usually do get better with a warm vs a cold engine, but it can also
go the other way.

Like I said, my $0.02.  If I really knew what I was talking about it'd be a
dime.

Best,
