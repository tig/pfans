We were looking at rear Koni shocks for an '88 911
at Automotion today, and were presented with two
different design of the Sport Gas Hydraulic shocks.
Part No. 30-1214.

The first pair had a small rubber disc at the bottom of the
shaft that covered the top of the shock body. On top of
that was the big white rubber bumper. The top of the shaft
was normally threaded.

The other pair had NO rubber disc at the bottom of the
shaft that covered the top of the shock body. Instead,
it had the big white rubber bumper, then a black rubber
disk on top of the white rubber bumper. Then, the end
of the shaft appeared to have a brass collar slightly
larger than the diameter of the shaft. The threads
appeared normal.

Automotion had no idea why they were different, because
the part numbers were the same, as were the automotion 
stock numbers. There was a different 4 digit number stamped


on the bottom of the shock body.

Anybody have an idea what the differences mean?

Thanks,

Jim Bauman, Tom Pickett

PS: These shocks were YELLOW!! I was brought up to believe
that the only true Konis were RED.
