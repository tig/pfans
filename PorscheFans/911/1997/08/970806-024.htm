First only the front of the 993 has adjustable spring perches; the rears are
fixed.

I was starting to replace the front stock US springs with the H&Rs, found
they were way too low for my preference (figured I'd rip out the bottom of
the
on local western PA roads).  Top of front tires were hidden by fender lips
even with spring seat screwed up to maximum height. Took them out,
never installed the rears.  Returned them; 
purchased a set of Euro Sport springs from Windward Performance (also
put in the M030 struts and sway bars at same time).  Car is at excellent
height for street driving; feels great in autocross and Watkins Glen driver's
ed.  Drive from Pgh to the Glen was slightly choppy but not bad, even on 
BFG R1s.

 I have heard good things about the H&R springs, and I've also heard that 
 the 993s come with "adjustable spring perches" so I don't know if this 
 means you can adjust the ride heights using the stock springs, without 
 having to go to an aftermarket brand.  Can anyone offer insight into this 
 "adjustable perch" feature?

 I have a 1995 Model 993 I would like to "lower" for drivers-ed events at
 Road Atlanta. Does anyone have any experience/suggestions about the various
 springs available ?
