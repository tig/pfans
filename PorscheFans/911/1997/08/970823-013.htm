Andy, I would say this is not true; I adjusted the valves on my '84 Carrera
several
times and didn't have to remove the AC.  Now, the factory air filter was
another
matter;  this gave me more trouble than the AC.   I found things much easier 
when I went to the Autothority Mass Air Flow  sensor with the conical K&N
filter.

As far as "secrets", the valve adjustment gasket set and the factory-
style gap gauge to me is a MUST.  Follow the factory sequence, make sure
crankshaft is rotated close to 120 degrees as you progress from cylinder to 
cylinder, and have a small, powerful, cool light to show you where the valves
are.  Also, long thin strong arms and fingers are a definite plus.

I have an 86 911 Carrera Targa with factory air conditioning.  I heard a
rumor
that you need to remove the AC to get access to the valves for
adjusting.....is
this true?  Are there any special tricks to adjusting the valves in a 911
(i've
done them in a 914).

Thanks in advance,
