The factory manuals for my 1971 911S have some good overall information
and charts concerning the fuel hoses/system and the mechanical fuel
injection.  If you send me your fax number or an address, I'll send you
whatever I can find in these manuals.  What kind of "chart" were you
looking for?

Subject: 72 911T Still acting up!!!!

I recently posted a message about a 911 T (72) that I just bought. I
stated
that the car would cut out, stop running, backfire, miss generally just
run
like poop when it reached opperating temps. Well I got back lots of
great
responses and some great info. Thanks to all who answered my plea for
help. I
now have some new questions. I think ive narrowed the problem to the
tank not
venting correctly. If I undo the hose in the trunk, on the top of the
tank it
seems to run fine.  When I put it back on then drive it till it warms up
it
does all of the above. Now your problally saying just drive with the
hose
off. I have a problem with this because the gas fumes that get into the
interior just about knock me out. So heres my Questions.

1) Does this seem like a reasonalbe diagonosis of the problem and has
any one
encountered this before.

2) Does any one know what all of those hoses coming off the top of the
tank
do and i noticed one  going into a black box  then out to the front of
the
car. Whats all this doing seems like over kill for just venting the
tank.

3) Does any one have a chart on a Bosch Mech. fuel Inj. I saw some in
the
Automotion cat. but they didnt have one for mech. inj.

Well thats it for now all answers will be greatly appreciated.
