Good to hear that Del is still in the business. I spotted Del in 1975 and
took him his first-ever Porsche paint job: my '73T. He repainted my car
from silver to black and added 'RS' flares and custom bumper ends.
Thorough, meticulous, and a nice guy. We probably sold 7 or more Porsche
customers on his work based upon the results he got on my car.
