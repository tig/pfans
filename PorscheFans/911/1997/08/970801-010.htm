Pfans,

Because of the great success I have had following the detailed instructions
of those expert souls on this list, I am putting together a web site which
will be like a fancy faq of 911 repairs.  My first two, coming from
personal experience, are oil change and replace clutch cable.  I would like
to ask for any that you might have. The page will start out directed at the
 73-77 911's but I imagine,  some of the repairs will span many years.  If
you've read a good one and think it should be added, forward it to me and I
will write the original publisher and ask permission.  I have been helped
greatly by the good people on this list like Terry Shugart and Wade Guthrie
and I'd like to give back a little something.

Send submissions to gpradel@ibm.net.

I'll let you know the URL as soon as I publish the first page.

Thanks....

George
