Fred:
Some thoughts on the G50-50 conversion. First of all your 4 speed is worth 
what you can get for it, if it has a LSD or Quaife it is more valuble, but 
without it's probablly worth around $1500+ or -. My mechanic, Mosport Auto in 
Jacksonville Florida, does G50 conversions on his customers turbo cars not 
G50-50. This is because the gear sets in the G50 are better spaced than the 
G50-50. I have driven 930's with both gearboxes and the difference is 
remarkable, in fact if I had a G50-50 in my 89 or newer car I would buy the 
G50 gears for it, immediately. The conversion is fairly expensive, buy a G50 
for around 1200-1800, buy pedals, shifter, and other stuff then convert the 
bell housing and input shaft plus labor and don't forget to freshen the the 
G50 internally before fitting and a Quaife of course! I think the tab is 
somewhere around $6,000 (for everything) +options. In my opinion besides a 
1bar wastegate spring & Euro exhaust system this is the best use of your money 
to improve the power delivery and driveability of your 930.
Good luck!
