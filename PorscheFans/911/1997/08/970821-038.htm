I found the following on the internet. 
Do you think it is a good buy?
Can someone sell a car without passing the CA SMOG?
If you would like to use it on the track and autocrossing only. Is that
okay to DMV?

Please give me some advise, Thanks.

=====================================
The car has been in storage for 4 months.I inherited the car from my
uncle
last May and now I need to pay for my tuition for my final semester at
Cal.

The car is a deep red (repainted from original color less than 1 year
ago).

It looks great...I've got late 911 Porche Cookie cutter rims on the car
with new tires.

The car has Weber Carburetors, but they are preventing the car from
passing smog. You need to change it back to stock.

The car has 77k original miles.(documented)
THe orginal factory radio is in the car and works.
The interior is absolutely clean..no tears in the seats...the dash has a
crack in it. The headliner is fine.

The car runs great mechanically, but there is a major oil seal/gasket
leak. I've gotten estimates of $200-$600 to fix the leak.

I've driven the car to Lake Tahoe and Back with no problems whatsoever,
but the leak is pretty bad now so I would seriously suggest that the
seal
be changed ASAP. 

I've got to pay tuition by Sep 15 and would like to sell the car as soon
as possible.
