Safety mods first:
1. Better brakes: racing pads/fluid    $200 (brake scoops nice $200)
2. Pair Harnesses: $300-$400
3. Seats (optional)  $500-$1000
4. Fire Extinguisher  $25 but Halon cost more $$

After a year or two on street tires, if you're serious:
1. Wider wheels/sticky tires: 225/50 on 15x7, 245/45 on 15x8  $1200+
2. Bigger torsion bars: 22mm front, 28mm rear   $450
3. Adjustable sway bars: 22mm front and rear    $450
4. Lower, corner balance and track alignment    $600?
5. Koni/Bilstein shocks   $400-$500
6. Budget to move oil cooler to front spoiler in long run
     if you see high temps at the track.
7. Budget for front/rear spoilers to aid high-speed stability

Biggest bang for buck would be tires first, suspension second.
All estimates above do not include labor.  Tires alone would be
$550 if you can use your current wheels.   You can make your own
brake scoops for a lot less.   I've done most of the above on my car
in different sizes and paid for half of it by doing the work myself.   
I'd hate
adding up the numbers to see what I have 'invested' in my car.
