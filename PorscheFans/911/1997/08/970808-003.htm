Ray Price asks if he should advance or retard his spark timing on his 83
to get rid of a ping under hard acceleration, and which way to turn the
distributor to do this.

You want to retard the timing.  The ping is (per your diagnosis) because
the firing of the plug is occuring too far before the piston reaches top
dead center.  For maximum power you want to advance the timing until it
is just short of pinging for the octane of your gas, the density altitude of
the air, how injection is set and working, etc.  However, most people
leave a margin here, as pinging does no good and can do a lot of harm,
and nobody would want to be readjusting things all the time (Lucky
owners of Carreras and later DME cars have a computer and sensors
which do this kind of fine tuning).  The factory settings leave a margin
(plus are aimed at meeting smog requirements).

Porsche changed the rotation of the distributor at some point. 
Anderson's book mentions this.  I haven't got that stuff memorized,
because I set my timing (seldom, because with the pointless ignition you
and I have it doesn't change over time like the points did) with a timing
light.  Locate the TDC mark on the crank pulley - it is marked Z1 
(Z=Zentrum in German?).  It probably has another mark just to the right of
it, which would be the timing mark at whatever the rpm spec is for timing.
If your timing is to the right of this mark it is more advanced than the
factory wants it to be.  Rotate the distributor while using the timing light
with the engine running until the timing is on the mark - you can see if
things are moving the way you want or not, and if you are turning in the
wrong direction, just go the other way.  At idle you won't harm anything.

Another point to consider, especially if you find that the low RPM timing is
about where it is supposed to be, is that the distributor, or part of it, is
going bad.  On my 81 there are both vacuum advance and retard lines, I
think.  If this mechanism quits you may not be getting some retard which
is needed.  The good news is the vacuum mechanism on the distributor
is replacable.  You could do it yourself, but I don't know a source of this
Bosch part, and I had a shop do it along with some other things.  You
figure out if the part is bad by disconnecting the vacuum lines and
attaching one on which you can suck (mouth or Mityvac) with the cap,
rotor, and dust cap off.  If nothing moves when you suck, the diaphram
is busted.  If it moves, it is probably OK.  Check each vacuum port.
