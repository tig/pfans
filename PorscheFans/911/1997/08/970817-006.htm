** Warning: Long Append **

Having just bought a 911, I thought I'd provide some observations and 
recommendations to the hopeful benefit of anyone who might be in the 
market. This has mostly been covered by others, but maybe there will 
be something to help someone else. Not looking to spark any flames 
(Insert "Frankly my dear..." line from Gone With the Wind here).

On a major purchase like this, I first recommend that you read, read, 
read. This forum is a good start; good reading is Excellence 
magazine, Original Porsche 911 by Peter Morgan, The Used 911 Story by 
Peter Zimmermann, Porsche 911 Performance Handbook by Bruce Anderson, 
911 owners handbook (the one that comes in the glovebox), 911 
Technical Specifications book, (I bought an 81, so I have new 1982 
owners handbook and 82-83 Technical Specs book for sale - $30 for 
both), a 911 Parts and Technical Reference Catalog (74-89), and a 
video I found helpful is 911 Close Up: Body and Mechanical 
Inspection. I looked at many books, and I highly recommend the ones 
listed above, at least as a core set.  Each has their own merits, and 
together they provide a broad set of information.  You should also 
look over the PCA region internet web sites - there's a wealth of 
information amongst them. 

An important first step is to narrow the years you'll be looking
for. You might narrow in on a series based on looks, price, or
something else important to you. For example, I decided I wanted a
1980 or later U.S. (not European) 911SC coupe - because of
engine/emissions management, price, SC longevity, and 911SC coupe
shape. Regarding exterior colors, I decided up front that I wasn't
interested in red or black. This helped to narrow down the cars I
would look at. 

You need to consider if you want to look locally or remotely. I
started out looking all over the US, but ended up concentrating
on what I could look at within a several hour drive. Convenience
was part of the reason, and I found as I got past the research
stage to the buying stage that there was a choice of vehicles
within driving distance of my home. 

So, where to look? I used the internet to look at: newspaper ads
(Yahoo has a good index to much of what's available), dealer web
sites, Calling All Cars, and PCA region "For Sale" pages (some
change daily, and other change "periodically"). Your local
papers are good resources too. You can contact your local PCA
region and attend their meetings, let people know you're
looking, ask for leads, etc. Also talk to local mechanics about
leads. 

Before looking at cars, decide on a mechanic.  If buying a car
locally, you'll want them to look it over. (Note: If a seller
balks at having your mechanic look it over, walk away from the
deal). If you don't have a mechanic, or are buying remotely, find out
where the closest Porsche dealer is (you can use the dealer finder on
their website). Talking to several dealerships, I found that they all
do pre-sales inspections. Be sure and have a leakdown test done - it
tells alot about the condition of the engine. You may have to insist
on it - more than one dealer service manager expressed surprise at my
leakdown request.

When you call a seller, some questions to ask are: How long
have they owned it?  How far back do the service records go? (I found
several  that had NO records, including no current records) What needs
fixing? How many miles? Has it been used on track/autocrossed? What's
been repaired or serviced? Any problem having a/my mechanic look the
car over? Ask them to describe the car - then shutup and listen. The
human mind abhors a telephone vacuum, and people sometimes say  the
darndest things!

Before going to look at a car, write down the range of VIN and
engine numbers for that model year, as well as color codes to
verify the car is as claimed, and whether it's the original
color. Remembered to take your flashlight too.  You're there,
the car is in front of you. Tell the owner you want to spend
30-45 minutes looking the car over before taking it for a drive.
Verify the VIN,  engine, and color numbers. Get on your back and
start by looking under the engine - note oil leaks and sources,
work your way around looking under the body for dents, rust,
other damage, etc. Look at the engine itself. Sit inside and
look around at the seats, dash, rear seats, headliner, under
carpets,  etc. Look in the front trunk for crash damage. You get
the idea. If you don't like what you see, thank the owner and
leave. Otherwise, time for a drive. Ask the owner to drive
first, so you can get an idea of how they drive it. If you like
what you see, have a mechanical inspection done and close the
deal.  

Other observations:

* I talked to several owners who had their vehicles for 1 to 3
years. With  amazing consistency, any problems were due to
the previous owners.

* With 1987 911's pushing prices into the low 20K range, in
general, 911SC's priced in the $20K range and above are over priced
and should be negotiated down - unless you are looking for a museum
piece. Bruce Anderson  recently did a 911 market survey article in
Excellence. The Kelly Blue Book website also has some pricing
information.

* When you budget for your purchase, keep aside a miscellaneous
fund for things like pre-sale car inspections (prices vary - budget
$250-$350 per inspection), car registration with the state (mine was
$400), insurance premiums (you did call your agent to get a price
quote before buying the car), parts that need fixing/replacing as soon
as you're handed the keys, tensioner update if not already installed
on pre-1984 911's (basic parts are $325-$350), tires, appropriate
cleaner/polish/leather care products, 12+ quart oil pan if you do your
own oil changes, PCA dues ($36),  etc.

Well, I hope that helps someone with their quest. If anyone has
questions, please let me know.
