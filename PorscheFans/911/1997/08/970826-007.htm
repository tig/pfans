Paul,

My oil pressure sender gave out on my '86 911 Targa recently.  Whenever the
ignition was on it pegged at the top of the gauge, then dropped to zero when
the power was cut off.  To determine if it was the sender or gauge, my
mechanic had me turn the ignition on (but not start the engine).  The gauge
went to the top.  He then unplugged the wire on the sender and the gauge
dropped to zero.  With the wire still unplugged, he grounded it to the chasis
with a short piece of wire, and the gauge pegged at the top again.  He said
since the gauge moved, he thought it was the sensor.  Turned out he was right,
a new sensor and all works fine.

Turns out the sensors are hard to get a wrench on, so after I bought one inten
ding to do it myself, I had to give up and seek professional help.

Good luck,

Greg Stephens
'86 Targa - now with confirmed oil pressure
