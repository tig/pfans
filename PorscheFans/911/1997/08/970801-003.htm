What follows applies to the '84-'89 911 DME equipped engine, and may give
ideas for troubleshooting other models.


I decided to look into the slight surging that my car had under very light
load.  I completed a full service including plugs, distributor cap and
rotor, all filters, valve adjustment, oil change, and a new O2 sensor.  I
inspected (both visually & with propane) the whole intake system for
false-air leaks and found none.  Then I did my best to set the idle mixture
using the O2 sensor.

The surging improved significantly but I was not satisfied.  So, I
connected a multimeter in-line with my O2 sensor so I could monitor the
fuel mixture while driving under a range of conditions.  


I made the following observations with the sensor disconnected from the DME:
	1.  Idle mixture set to lean initially (O2 sensor reading very low); reset
to be stochastic or slightly rich.
	2.  Mixture lean at very light throttle (explains surging); improved
though still lean after richening the mixture (think I may have some
unmetered air entering).
	3.  Mixture rich at high load.


Then I reconnected the O2 sensor to the DME and made the following
observations:
	1.  Idle mixture stochastic at idle and very light throttle (reading jump
high and low, very quickly)
	2.  Under medium load (e.g., 65mph cruise) the readings held at high, then
low, then medium . . . -- think the O2 sensor is switching faster than my
meter can read


The bottom line I believe is that the DME system can compensate through a
wide range of operating conditions.  I think I've got a slight intake air
leak that leads to the mild surging as the DME searches for the correct
mixture.

Hope this provides some troubleshooting ideas.  I'd appreciate any thoughts.
