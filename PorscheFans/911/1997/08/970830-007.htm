Comments? enlightenment?

My understanding of the Turbo is that it boosts high end torque==power
giving a very fast high-end performance that doesn't really "cut in" right
away (the turbo lag). Hence, the Turbo is somewhat of a slow starter, but a
beast in the long haul.

My understanding of the Supercharger is that it is the opposite. Low-end
torque for wheel screeching starts, but lower-than-Turbo high end
performance.

So, the super would appear to be better for the around-town driver, where
jumping out at the light or getting into traffic quickly is needed. As
opposed to the top-end speed, which you can't go to anyway (unless your
commute includes the Autobahn).

I have seen an ad in either Excellence or Pano (or both) about "Knoxville
Supercharging". Anyone have one of these in their car? Or know of them?
