Hello all,
     Well, after selling my pristine 1979 911SC with only 44,000 miles last 
week, I am looking for a 911 to replace it with. I want to buy something that 
I can use as a daily driver, even during the Wisconsin winters. I figured that 
I would take my time and look for a 964 C4. Well, I found a 1989 911 Carrera 4 
with 23,000 miles on it. I went to look at it this morning, and it is 
beautiful. It has all records and documentation, and everything seems to be in 
order. The interior and all mechanical systems seem to be brand new. I am 
amazed at how far these cars came in 10 years. It is such an amazing 
automobile. The only weird thing about the car is the paint. It is painted 
bright yellow. It is the same yellow that I believe is called speed yellow, 
and is offered on the current 993's. I like it, and it looks great. However, 
the car was purchased as Guards red. The person who bought it apparently 
bought the only one that he could find when they came out, and immediately had 
it painted. It is an amazing paint job. I could not tell that it was not 
original. Everything has been repainted. Even down in the spare wheel well, 
the engine bay, everything. My questions are:

- What do you guys think about a car that has gone through a color change?
- What does this do to the value of the car?
- Was this color offered on the 964 cars?
- What things should I look for on this car? I know about the dual mass 
flywheel, but '89's don't have them. I have read the discussions about the 
engine tray, and this one still has it on. 
- What different tricks will I need to know in going to the C4 from my SC? 

I would appreciate any help that I could get, and any tips, or info that I 
could get would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance for your replies to this message, and I would also like to 
thank everyone who helped me in the past with my SC. 

Regards,
   --Josh
