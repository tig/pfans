Hello all,

This is my first posting to the list, but I've 
been a member since last year.  Thanks for all the 
interesting discussions.

Anyway my question concerns oil viscosity grade.  I own an 
'84 911 Carrera with 49,500 miles.  The previous 
owner used Mobil One (synthetic) oil and I continue 
to do so.  I drive the car on the street about 6,000 miles 
per year and garage it during the winters and other bad 
weather.  Highest temperatures here in the Chicago 
area are about 95F, with the average summer day hitting 
perhaps 80F.

Mobil's Web page lists recommended oil grades for the 911 and 
according to them 10W30 is appropriate for the 911 and my  
application:

 http://www.mobil.com/consumer/mobil1/mobil1/mobil1faq.html

My question: does this grade seem too light for the 911?

I've seen people on this list mention that they use 20W50. 
To me it would seem that using an unnecessarily 
high viscosity grade would reduce power and efficiency, 
but I'd like to know that I'm not trading away engine 
longivity by using 10W30.  I've never noticed a low oil  
pressure problem in my 911 with this oil.

BTW, my $0.02 worth for the oil-consumption thread:
my (3.2l) engine seems to use about one quart per 2,000 miles. 

Thanks in advance.
