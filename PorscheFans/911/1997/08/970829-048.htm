    Yes.

    The gauge reading is only valid when the car is level and the
    engine is warm and idling (and even then, it's not always
    accurate).

    Go to the trouble of popping the bonnet and checking the
    dipstick every once in a while (under the same conditions: level,
    warm, and idling)... Aside from anything else, doing so will 
    familiarize you with how your engine's SUPPOSED to look, so if
    it suddenly stops running one day while you're driving out in the
    midle of nowhere, you might be able to recognize that the coil
    wire's come loose or whatever.

    Well, it'd be a LOT easier if I could draw you a picture... But
    I'll try anyway:

    "Bump steer" refers to the tendency of the wheels to toe-in or
    toe-out as they move up and down (e.g., when the car runs over a
    bump, noses down under braking, or rolls in a turn).

    There are some rare exceptions (like designing in a TINY amount
    of front toe-out in bump in order to kill corner-entry understeer
    so you don't have to pitch the car into the corners), but in
    general, bump steer is a Bad Thing and should be adjusted out of
    your suspension.

    If you want to know exactly what causes bump steer and how
    moving the steering rack up and down changes it, just ask and
    I'll post a lengthy message on the subject.
