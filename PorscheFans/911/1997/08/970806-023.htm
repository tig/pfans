Koni has evidently changed the design a bit on the 30-1214 units. I verified
these diffences on units we have in stock. There shouldn't be any diffences
in performance between the two. The four digit number you say at the bottom
is likely the production date of the units (i.e. 9311 would indicate a unit
made in November of '93) Very likely these two unit came out of different
production runs. All Koni sport units (stiffer valving) are yellow.
