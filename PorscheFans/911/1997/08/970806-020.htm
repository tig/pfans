I think the reason for the understeer is because you are now getting so 
much better grip from the rear tires.  I don't think moving to the 6" 
wheels in the front is the solution.  I would look at adding more 
negative camber to the front, and/or increasing the front tire pressure 
first.

You may want to try adjusting the front anti-roll bar to be softer (or 
make the rear bar stiffer).  If you don't have adjustable anti-roll bars, 
you may want to install some to allow you to adjust the balance and cure 
this problem.

The vibration is probably either a balance problem with the wheels/tires 
in the front.  Good tire shops can balance the wheel on the car to 
minimize vibration.
