I have a 1972 911 and I am doing some repairs underneath the car. My
question is what is the best way to remove the thick underbody coating? I
have been using an angle grinder but this is method tedious and messy. How
about using a propane torch to make the coating charred and easy to scrape
off?

Angle grinder?  Ouch.  You will also gouge and scratch the belly pan.  The
problem with the factory undercoat on early 911s is that there is little
under the undercoat to stop creeping rust.  I use an electric heat gun to
soften the undercoating.  Propane torch works, but watch out for setting
the car on fire!  After warming up the undercoat (a 4-hot or hotter seems
to work), use a sharp scraper (mine is 1" wide).  The stuff comes off in
strips.  Then put a stiff wire brush on your angle grinder, and buzz the
rest off.  Not a fun job, but essential if you are to get out the "iron
worm" eating at your body.

Never put new undercoat on bare metal.  That is the same mistake the
factory made in the early years.  They, and we now know better.  First
passivate  (etch) the metal, then apply a rust-inhibiting primer (must
contain metallic zinc, zinc chromate or zinc phosphate).  The metal should
be etched with phosphoric acid, which, in simple terms, deactivates the
chemical driving force for the rust reaction.  This will help the new paint
to stick, and also helps retard rust creep under the new coating.  DuPont
sells a primer called "Vari-Prime" that they claim is "self-etching".  I
use it, and skip the difficult step of applying and removing the etchant. 
You should build about 3 mils of dry film thickness in the primer, and then
apply the undercoat to protect the primer.  I did this in 1977 on my 1970T.
 Still watching, but no new rust has appeared in the belly pan.

Hope this helps.  As you may see, I am fanatical about keeping the early
Porsches rust-free!
