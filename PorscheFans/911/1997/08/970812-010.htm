Steve,

very interesting comparison. I thought that Porsche's  magnesium wheels on the
964RS were light.
I have used a bathroom scale as well; results with new Michelin MXX3 tires:

Front: 205/50ZR17
7x17 from 39.7(left)  to 40.8 (right) 

Rear:255/40ZR17
9x17 from 45.2 to 46.3

I did measurements with new Yokos as well and the results was similar (same
scale). I haven't done measurements of
tieres or wheels alone, unfortunately.
HRE seems to be THE wheel. However I still have doubts that my mag wheels are
that heavy.

Has anybody put FISKE on a scale?
