This is for (another) Steve, who asked about installing the Moch 1 speaker
enclosure, and since I get the list in digest mode I can't respond to
him individually (his address wasn't in his signature).  So my
apologies, etc.

The Moch 1 I've seen advertised is an update of what used to be called
the Clover enclosure, and I have one in my car.  The unit I have came
with clamps that are supposed to snap onto the stock luggage hooks
that come on the rear shelf.  This method does allow for easy removal,
but it doesn't fit very well this way.  The "permanent" method still
allows the unit to be removed, but not so easily.

The method:  Drill two holes in the bottom of the enclosure, located
to accommodate one of the stock screw locations for each of the
luggage hooks.  The hole should be large enough to permit adjustment,
but small enough to be covered by a large washer.  Pull the hooks,
leaving only the holes (actually, do this first).  This is what the
Clover people told me--but you'll also, most likely, need longer
screws--stove bolts whose thread matches the luggage hook screws.
Pull the speakers and work from the speaker opening to the inside, and
locate the bolts and washers over the holes--then route the wires,
settle the unit, and tighten.

If you have an older car, you'll need to remove and relocate the snaps
that hold the straps that secure the rear jump seats--they're held in
with screws.  I put mine on the front of the enclosure.

This installation requires no drilling, and is easily reversible.

Of course, if you have the factory rear speakers then you won't need
any of the above.  I've also seen an ad in Pano for a rear
enclosure-plus-shelf that looks factory.

I have this enclosure in my car, which, like the car itself, is 22
years old.  I've had a mind to update the speakers, but I've been
lazy.
