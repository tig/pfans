For the ten years that I've owned my 1971 911T Targa, I have had a 
strange steering kickback that I hadn't been able to get rid of.  
Finally after balancing the wheels many times, aligning the front end 
many times, installing steering rack spacers, installing turbo tie 
rod ends, replacing the brake pads, machining the rotors, making sure 
the wheels weren't bent, and replacing the tires, I solved the 
problem.

Apparently, one (or both) of my front brake calipers was hanging up 
against the rotor just enough so that at about 65 mph it would cause 
a steering kickback similiar to the way an out of balance wheel 
feels.

What clued me into this solution was that I had a hung up caliper on 
my BMW 2002 that was causing a slight pull when I was driving on the 
freeway.  After I rebuilt the calipers, machined the rotors, and 
replaced the internally swollen rubber brake hoses, the problem 
completely vanished.

I did the same thing to the brakes on my 911and low and behold the 
problem with it vanished.  When the brake calipers were apart they 
had a little bit of rust on the pistons, but nothing too bad.  It 
goes to show you that after ten or so years it is a good idea to 
recondition your entire brake system.

It is wonderful to have smooth steering!  Now, if I could just get 
all of the air out of my brake system.......
