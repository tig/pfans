The Michelin MXX3 Pilot would be the best compromise street/track tire.
It has nearly the performance of the special track tires.  The drawbacks
are that the tread life is not that great (probably closer to 15K miles
on the back, more on the front) and they are more expensive than some
other high-end street tires.  But you can't have everything.  Tires
that are less expensive and have a longer tread life, such as the Dunlop
SP8000 and the Yokohame AVS, are not going to do as well on the track.
