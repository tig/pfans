Terry,

I just returned from England and went through the same debate that you went
through.  My conclusion, enjoy the car in Europe, sell it and buy another
at home.  

If you can't bear the thought of parting, your first stop should be the
DOT, EPA, and Customs Service.  Each can provide you with an information
brochure that provides the basic requirements.  Basically, your car will
have to be certified by the manufacturer or importer to meet US
specification.  I laughed when I called the first importer, he didn't ask
what type of car I had, but quoted $5,000 to $7,000.  And, the car that I
was considering was an '87 with 38,000 miles for $18,000.  It had Swiss
emissions including a CAT, and none of that mattered.

Just so you know, the changes included DOT tires, door reinforcements,
emissions, lights, bumper . . .  The charges included shipping $1,000, bond
in the port $200, emission testing ?, engine modifications ?, parts ?,
labor ?.  On top of that, Gray Market cars usually resell at a discount to
US spec cars.

Guess you see.  The way I see it, the US Government has closed the Gray
Market.  I'm now looking at the opposite transaction when I move back to
England.
