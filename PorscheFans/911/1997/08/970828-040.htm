Greetings PFans - 

Need a little technical help. The other day I replaced the high tension
lead from the coil to distributor on my 70 911T. Why I did that is
another story and now I wish I hadn't touched it. Anyway, I cranked the
engine but it wouldn't start.  I found the lead from the CDS to the #15
terminal of the coil had broken off. I reconnected it, but still no go.
I've checked the coil ohm readings and they all are in limits.  The CDS
still whines, but still no spark out of the coil.  Nothing else was
touch!  Any ideas?  Any other way to verify the CDS is functioning
properly?  Would having the lead from the CDS to coil open while the
engine was cranked actually cause it to go bad?  The cost of the CDS
units seem absorbantly high! Are these units repairable? Any help or
suggestions would be appreciated.
