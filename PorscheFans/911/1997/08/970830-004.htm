Ignore the oil level gauge except when the oil is warm (180F) and
the car has been idling for 30 seconds or so.  Then, and only then,
use the gauge as an *indication* of how much oil is in the tank.
Some car's gauges are accurate - some aren't.  Always go by the
dipstick.  The oil level gauge drops drastically under heavy
throttle.  That's normal.

Bump steer is a change in toe as the front tire moves
up and down.  It has to do with the geometry of the front
suspension and the steering components.  I *think* that
ideally, you want to have the tie rods parallel to the ground
(someone correct me if I'm wrong - TIA).  The problem is
that as the tires move up and down, this parallelism is
disturbed.  It's not too big of a deal when the car is at a
"normal" ride height, but when the front's been lowered, the
angle of the tie rod changes to an extent that the phenomenon
is more noticeable.
