I am reposting this as I don't believe too many people saw it the first
time, (bugs w/ list in july) and I think it may be helpful to many..

I was allegedly doing 67 in a 50 zone, according to a K-55 radar gun in
a
Newark, NJ police cruiser on the Pulaski Skyway (for those familiar with
NY/NJ).

I decided to fight the charge, and I reccomend all of you to do the same
EVERY time it happens to you. I WAS 100% SUCCESSFUL YESTERDAY!!!!!

Once you are ticketed for speeeding--there are 3 ways for you to avoid
getting hit with points by your insurance co (and by the state if your
state charges points)-- here's how:

1. Plead not guilty and get a court date. If the police officer doesn't
show up and you do-- you can ask the court to dismiss the charge for
lack of prosecution. This routinely works because in most traffic
courts-- there is no prosecutor-- there's just you, the police officer,
and the judge. Without the police officer-- the state has no case! This
is what happened to me yesterday!!!   Some say that to slightly increase 
the chances of you getting a no-show officer situation on your court
day--
request adjournments before the first court date.(You want the
adjournments 
because chances are a little less likely that the police officer who
ticketed 
you will be properly informed of this new court date, and he will
therefore be a no-show...)

2. If the officer does show up-- you will want to speak to him before
you 2 talk to the judge-- here's one way: 
When your name is called for roll call -- answer that you are
present-- then if the officer is also there-- he will answer--"officer
present" right after you say that you are present. Now is your
opportunity to speak to him quietly for a moment. Just ask him/her if
the two of you could have a word or two. As a matter of fact--
many of the officers took the initiative at this point and THEY called
the defendant out into the hallway for a minute to have a chat. 

Your goal is to have the officer ammend the summons to some other
offense so
that he still gets credit for the "collar", the city still gets their
fine money, BUT you won't get any points!!!! 

In NJ, you want to get the offense ammended to 39:4-215 -- this is
'failure to obey signals, signs, or directions'. The judge can set the
fine as high as your origninal
speeding ticket-- but there are no points for this offense!!!!!  I've
seen this successfully done numerous times. The police officer may even
offer to do this for you before you suggest anything! And remember-- if
you
show up and the officer does not-- you probably have already won!!!!

3. This last method is much harder, and you may need an attorney to pull
it off. You need to attack the process used by the state to measure your
rate of speed-- like the proper calibration and use of the radar gun at
the place where you were clocked, and the specific training of the
officer. The proof neccesary for this
sort of defense varies from state to state, and so you may need an
attorney on this one! What you are looking for are published cases in
your state where a judge has set the standards of proof neccesary for
the state to prove all aspects of the speeding offense, especially
proper working order and use of the speed reading device that you were
clocked with.

Hope this helps, Gregory in Hoboken, NJ


PS I now use K-40 front and rear undetectable radar detectors built into
my C2 cab, 
AND I also use a Valentine 1 on the windshield. (When I got my speeding
ticket 
last year-- I was driving my MR2-Turbo, and did not have any radar
detector on
at the time (doh!!)). The biggest plus of the K-40 is -- its always on--
you
don't have to first reach into your glove compartment, get your
detector, mount it on the windshield, etc. (it's way too easy for you to
tell yourself-- "oh--i'm just gonna be on the road for 10 minutes... I
don't need a radar detector right now..."

PPS  Bill Tomko recently wrote about his happy outcome on a speeding
ticket. Consider yourself lucky Bill. In NJ-- there is NO formal
discovery permitted for traffic court so NJ'ites can't use many of the
NMA techniques. Also-- when I shopped around for an attorney-- I was
routinely quoted $700-750 (not including appeals)-- and this is with
absolutely no guarantee of anything. I decided to represent myself.
BTW--  what's a PJC?
