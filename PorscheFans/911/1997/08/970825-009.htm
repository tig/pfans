Yes the CV joints are the "4 bolt" on the early model cars. The later 
model cars use the "6 bolt" CV joints. I am not sure about when the 
cahnge took place. I put a late model limited slip in my 72 915 trans 
and had to change the output flanges, CV joints, axles, etc. It was 
an expensive proposition, and I would not do it again. I should have 
just bought a Quaife (sp?). Your early model uses a mechanical 
speedometer take-off on the front of the transmission. In 76 or 77 
they cahnged to the electronic speedometer pick-up. I do not know how 
much trouble it would be to change a mechanical pick-up unit to an 
electronic. Good Luck.
