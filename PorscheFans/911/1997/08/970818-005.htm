 My question is what is the best way to remove the thick underbody coating? I
have been using an angle grinder but this is method tedious and messy. How
about using a propane torch to make the coating charred and easy to scrape off?

The BEST WAY?????     no such method exists other than a.....

no really you are on the right track, propane torch with the self-lighting
feature and an overpriced gasket scraper from Snap-On, leather 
gloves, resperator, fan, hand wire brush and some time.
Heat the undercoating to about the ignition point 6" square,
scrape with the overpriced scraper that is 12" in length and 2"
in scraper surface( works better than a simple putty knife because 
of leverage and distance away from work), immediatly following
the scraping while still hot the residuals can be wirebrushed revealing
a nice? clean? painted? surface ;<) The key is heat, followed with
bulk removal and the wire brushing, a pattern will soon develop,
and without a resperator other things will develop in your nose,
throat and lungs. Other developments include awful blisters on 
exposed skin due to the napalm effect, irratability due to the tedious
job of u-coat removal. And due make sure you check both sides
of the road b4 crossing-and never fly your kite in the vicinity of 
utility poles, burning your interior or wires will make you very unhappy
