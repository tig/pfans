If you have are involved in an accident, and you have non-DOT approved
brake lines, an opposing attorney can do serious damage.

In an advesarial situation the attorney will claim:

You are irresponsible for not having DOT approved components on a safety
critical system. This shows you just could be an irresponsible driver in
general and in fact should pay for your irresponsibility.

Racers use stainless steel brake lines (few are DOT approved because
real racers replace their lines often), you installed brake lines racers
use, therefore you beleive you are a racer and you in fact acted like
one on public streets.


Of course none of this is true, but what will you tell the jury when
asked "why did you not have DOT approved lines" and "how vould brakes
lines that are not DOT approved be safer and perform better than DOT
approved brake lines?"

If you are never involved in an accident, the difference may be in the
quality of the fittings with regard to their being able to handle
long-term metal fatigue.

Racers use stainless lines for protection against having the lines cut
by track debris and to minimize the risk of fire as these lines are
harder to rupture in an accident. They check the fittings for cracks and
wear or  just  replace them at regular intervals.

I wonder if stainless lines have any benefit whatsoever over Porchse
factory brake lines for non-race cars?
