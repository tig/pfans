Hey, Pfans!

Well, after a VERY long wait (almost 8 months of looking), I've bought
a car!!!!!!!

In the way that these things go, I started out looking for an early
Carrera, quite quickly changed to looking for a late Carrera, and
ended up buying a 1990 C2 coupe.

It's got 63,000 km (39,000 miles), 5-speed of course, sport seats,
a 'different' paint colour (more later!), and Porsche wheels that I
haven't seen before.

The paint is called 'sea foam', and apparantly (this has been verified
by Porsche) this was a special factory order at a rather large expense
to the original owner.

Has anyone else ever seen a 'sea foam' P-car before? I don't know if the
special order would be a small run of cars or a single car. It's kind of
a cross between green and charcoal grey. Quite nice, I think.

The wheels look a bit like the original C2 turbo wheels, but they're 16 inch
and the spokes are narrower. I am told that they were standard on later
C2s, but I can't recall ever seeing them before.

Tires are Continental Sport Contacts (anyone know how good these are?), 205/55
in front, 245/?? in back.

Only problem is that I don't have it yet - I pick it up Thursday and
boy am I looking forward to it!!!!!

Oh yeah, it's got the LUK clutch and has had the cylinder/head update. It's
getting the distributor vent kit tomorrow.

Yippeeeeee!!!!!!!

(for those that saw my note last week, this is NOT the salvaged vehicle
that I was interested in at that time...)

Cheers!

Ross
