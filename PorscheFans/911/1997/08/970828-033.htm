Denny, 



I was in the same place you are several months ago. I had been looking 
for over a year to find a true factory turbo-look car!  My only 
requirements were coupe, full service records, reasonable milage, no 
black cars or black interiors (here in Phoenix black interiors will kill 
you, even in a car with good A/C).  I was looking for years between 1985 
and 1989 preferably 87 or newer, and had feelers out from the West coast 
all the way to Missouri.  I never found a suitable car.  The C-2 based 
cars were out of my price range, but I'm sure they are even in higher 
demand.  Maybe someone can prove me wrong or maybe you will have better 
luck.  I did find one very nice 86, but you guessed it, black on black.



I really wanted the Turbo body style, but was scared to death of 
maintaining the turbo engine, and was very pleased with the performance 
of a 3.2 Carrera I owned previously.  Well, I purchase an true 1986 turbo 
3 months ago.  The car became available locally, met all my criteria, and 
was being service by the same mechanic who has worked on my cars in the 
past.  The only difference I am aware of in the Turbo vs Factory 
Turbo-Look cars is the engine, transmission, and the exhaust.  It uses 
all the same sheet metal, suspension, and brakes.  With this in mind, you 
still have the higher replacement/maint. cost of the larger brakes, 
tires, and turbo suspension components even on the normally aspirated 
cars.



I can't offer much advice on maint. costs as the car is so new to me.  We 
have all heard many stories about 3.2 Carrera engines living very long 
and heathy lives, but you frequently here about 3.3 Turbos needing 
rebuilds at 40-60K miles.  After looking at many cars, my theory is that 
many of the Turbo cars have performance modifications (bigger turbo, 
increased boost, larger intercooler, etc.) and see a lot of track time or 
are driven very hard.  My car is completely stock, even down to the radio 
and was never raced or tracked by the previous owners.  The car has 53K 
miles on it, and it is my every day driver.  Most people I know that own 
930's leave them in the garage, and only get them out to play (read: take 
to the track or drive hard).  With this in mind, most of the milage on 
turbo cars is accumulated with with very aggressive driving habits.  On 
the other hand, I put 800-1000 miles a month on my car with very few full 
throttle runs.  Mostly commuting to work, picking up groceries, etc.  If 
I drove it hard every time I was behind the wheel, I would have lost my 
licence along time ago.



The 15K service will cost more, as the engine is much more difficult to 
service and adjust valves with all the turbo plumbing in the way. And of 
course engine replacement parts will cost a little more.  I think there 
might be some additional oil lines on the turbo engines also. In turbo 
cars before 1989 you will have a 4-speed transmission.  I thought this 
might be a problem for commuting around town, but in the Phoenix area 
speed limits allow you to drive 45-60MPH even on secondary roads.  If you 
have to drive in town a lot at speeds around 30-45MPH the gearing will be 
awkward.  And also don't forget about the TURBO LAG!  Get some time 
behind the wheel of a turbo to make sure you like the way it drives.  
Some people don't ever grow to like the different driving characteristics 
you need to adopt in a turbo car, especially the 930 with it long lag 
time.  Remember to have any car you are thinking about purchasing 
inspected by a good mechanic. You hear this all the time, but even a 
short list of small items that need to be fixed can cost big bucks with 
the Turbo/Turbo-Look cars, or any Porsche for that matter... My mechanic 
had just performed the 15k service on the car I bought for the previous 
owner 5k miles before I purchased it.  I still had him spend the time to 
do a complete inspection including compression and leak down tests.  I 
hope you are able to pull some advice out of all this rambling!  
Hopefully some long term turbo owners will jump in with additional or 
better advice.  



Good Luck, and let us know what you decide...
