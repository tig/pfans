Some minor points. Diffusion is (for an ideal gas--remember your high
school chemistry/physics) dependant on the mass of the molecule and more
importantly its size.

I don't think (but I could be wrong--I'm at home and don't have access
to my diffusivity tables, otherwise, I'd actually give the numbers) that
there is not orders of magnitude between N2 and O2. If anything I'd
suspect that N2 would have a slightly higher diffusivity (leak rate).

Oxidation is a problem and, like diffusion, it is an energy activated
process, typically doubling its activity with each 10=B0C elevation in
temperature. However, for racing tires (and the time length over which
they're in service), this is immaterial. Oxidation of enough of the cord
material (assuming it is a non-stainless steel cord) will be
insignificant unless the tire is at MANY 100's of =B0C (usually called-th=
e
car's on fire!).

Regarding the oxygen content being a fire hazard, there's not enough
wiithin the tire to have an effect. Besides, the entire vehicle is in
the earth's atmosphere which has plenty of oxygen!

If you're really worried about atmospheric components when inflating
tires, the first thing is to remove water vapor. The rest is such a
minor effect that I wouldn't worry about it.

If you're really interested, I suggest getting the diffusivity values
out of the Handbook of Chemistry & Physics.
