	Nick:

    CDW is a "Collision Damage Waiver".  If you purchase it, you
    don't pay for damage to the car in the event of a collision.

    LDW means "Loss Damage Waiver".  It's more-or-less the same as
    CDW.

    SLI is "Supplemental Liability Insurance"; it's excess insurance
    that works like the LDW, but protects you from LIABILITY claims
    (e.g., third-party medical and property damage).

    "FL SRCHG & FEE" sounds to me like "Florida [government-mandated]
    surcharge and fee": a tax.

    Neither; you can decline to accept any of the "insurance"
    policies.

    As the holder of a non-US pasport, however, you're eligible for
    an insurance policy that none of us natives can get.  Its name
    varies from one rental agency to the next, but most call it
    "ESP", for "Emergency Sickness Plan".

    ESP insures you againts certain medical expenses resulting from
    sickness that occurs during the rental period.  Most rental
    agencies also offer a "personal accident and effects" (PAE)
    policy, which covers you and members of your party for medical
    expenses resulting from an accident during the rental period
    (even, in many cases, if you're not in the rental vehicle at the
    time).

    If your UK medical insurance doesn't cover you while you're here
    in the States, purchasing PAE and ESP will provide you with
    medical coverage that you might otherwise be unable to obtain. 

    Hope this helps...
