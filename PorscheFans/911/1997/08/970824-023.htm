Fans:

Hello. I recently parted company with my '87 944 with great hopes of going
air-cooled, and I am seeking advice. I started reading up on which generation
911 is for me and what fits in my 'toy' budget.  To cut to the chase it
appears as though '74 to '82 would do nicely in both the styling and price
range. A few questions arise however. After reading a recent 'Excellence'
article on values and problems on middle age 911s. Chain tensioners seemed to
be a major problem, also the head studs and valve guides were mentioned. 

I am used to model specific problems as the 944 line had their share of odd
 problems. I guess the body of my question would be simply what to look for
in these inherent problems and what sort of cash to factor in to a potential
purchase. Any stories involving purchases would also be very helpful and very
appreciated. Thank you in advance.
