When you look into tire physics, it's necessary to 
look into the fact that the coeficient of friction
for a tire is dependant on both loading and temperature.

In a microstanpoint, it varries across the contact patch as well as 
contact pressure and temperature both vary over the egg-shaped
contact area.

What does this mean practically?

Well, that each specific tire size has a load (normal) vs. friction
(shear) curve associated with it for each average contact temperature,
assuming optimal contact patch (effected by camber, mainly).

If we further assume optimal temperature, we can generate a set of curves
on a single graph for a set of tires from a manufacturer, or for a 
met of manufacturese of the same size tire, etc.

For an individual tire, the tire may generate the following loads:

Normal	Side cf
0	0
50	62	1.24	
100	110	1.1
150	160	1.067
200	205	1.025
250	253	1,012
300	302	1.006
350	350	1.00
400	395	0.99
450	443	0.984
500	491	0.980
550	537	0.975
600	580	0.971
650	630	0.969
700	650	0.928
800	655	0.818
900	656	0.730
1000	658	0.658

If you graph this you will get a curve which levels out around 670
lbs of sideloading, with a 1.0 break even at 350 lbs.

This would be a rather narrow tire, say a 185.  Now compare a wider
tire, say a 275, and you may have the 1.0 break even at 520 lbs,, if
the tread width is proportional.

If you calculate cornering forces, and weight shifts at each end of th
ecar, to calculate the amount of total cornering force generated at
each tire, you will find that it is an iterative pricess limited by one
or perhaps two tires (almost certainluy the outermost tires).

On early 911 modesl, because iof the weight distribution and limited
available tire selection, it turns out that it pays to transfer all the
weight poissible across th front axle, to the point at whcih one tire
loses contact with the ground, in order to minimize weight transfer
across the rear and lessen the effect of overloading the outer rear
tire which is put in both lateral (cornering) and longitudinal
(acceleration) loading.

In general, the benefits of increased cornering vs. rolling and
arodynamicdrag make  selection of the widest available tire for a full
bodied car the correct selection, though too much of a good thing is
almost alweays bad when taken to extreems.

As always, pardon the typos....
