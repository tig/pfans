I've never had a problem on the road with my old trombone hoops in my 81
SC, even in upper 90s weather and the A/C on.  I've hit about 210
climbing a slight grade at about 75mph in these conditions.  On the
track, however, I was hitting about 270 in the same weather.  I
installed a used Carrera cooler on the front fender, took the headlight
out (for track use only), and cut out the headlight bucket.  I am only
seeing about 220 - 225 in the same conditions now.  On the highway with
the headlight back in, the temps stay about 190 max.  That's about a 20
degree drop on the highway and about 50 degree drop on the track with
this cooler installed.

I still have the two short oil hoses needed to install a Carrera cooler
in place of the hoops.  I paid $108 at the Porsche dealer, and I'm
selling them brand new for $75 including shipping, if anyone needs them.
