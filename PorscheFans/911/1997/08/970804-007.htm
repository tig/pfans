Whoops, the brain was stuck in reverse again.  That fourth paragraph
should have read "... got progressively worse as I REMOVED discs".

>My 1971 911S began running badly after I installed two 4 inch SuperTrapp
>mufflers.  The car is used for local autocrosses and time trials were I saw
>several cars with similar setups.  However, my car loses power between 3,500
>and 5,000 rpm so badly that it almost stumbles.  It seems strong below 3,500
>and it seems noticeably better than stock between 5,000 and the 7,200
>redline.
>
>Performance is "best" with no discs installed or with 12 discs in each
>muffler; however, the loss of power is still very noticeable in the mid-rpm
>band.  The effect is exaggerated as the number of discs decreases.  With only
>3 discs installed in each muffler, the car stumbles so bad that it won't make
>it through 5,000 rpms.
>
>The only other time the car has acted like this is when I put on a friend's
>excess Brusch muffler (from an E or T).  The Brusch muffler was very old and
>the pipe was about 1/8-1/4 inch narrower inside diameter than my original.  I
>concluded it was choking my engine and put the stock muffler back on the car.
>
>What am I missing?  Since timings from 20-90 mph got progressively worse as I
>added removed discs, it seems to me that the engine is being choked -- but
>this doesn't make sense with this free flowing exhaust.  Does the mechanical
>fuel injection need to be adjusted now that the exhaust flows better?  Any
>suggestions?
