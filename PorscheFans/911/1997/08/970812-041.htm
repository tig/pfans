Several questions regarding the 1986 911 I just purchased

1) Shifting - The car tends to grind when shifting into first gear before the
car comes to a complete stop.  If I downshift and try to put the car in first
prior to stopping is the primary cause of grind.  Is this normal?  I had a
1988 911 several years ago with the G50 transmission and don't recall this
type of problem.  The "used 911 story" book by PMZ publications states that
"911's require techncique to shift properly, only a mechanic can determine if
the transmission is in need of repair"  -  what the heck does this mean?

2)  I just did a 15K service on the car including valve adjustment.  The
valves sound loud and I notice that there was play in between the part that
contacts the valve stem and the screw shaft that you adjust the valve with,
is this normal?  Basic compression on the engine is solid.

3)  Engine runs a bit rough at idle when cold.  My 1988 had slight hesitation
at low RPM when cold but the 1986 sounds like crap.  I replaced
cap/rotor/plugs/filters and same problem.  I can smell fuel in the exist so I
don't think its a cold start problem.

4)  Why is the 1986 14HP short of the 1987 911?  Engine specs are same
mechanically.  Is it the DME?

Any help would be most appreciated.  Car is beautiful and runs real strong
otherwise.  911 is an incredible car, I don't know how I lived without one
while I went back to school!
