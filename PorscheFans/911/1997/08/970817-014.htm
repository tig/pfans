I strongly recommend that you try to purchase a 993 instead of a 
964.  The body style of the 993 is so much more attractive.  I feel 
strongly that the 993's resale value is going to remain strong for 
years.  The body style was only available for three years.  The 
shortest span of the 911 series.  Although the 964s are superior to 
the '74-'89s mechanically, cosmetically they aren't that special.  I 
think that the 964s were the ugliest 911s made.

If possible, you should try to get a '96 or newer.  They have a 
neat intake system.

When the 993 was introduced there were rave reviews from the press 
and it has sold well since its introduction.  Porsche could be making 
a mistake by dropping this body style so soon.  The pictures that 
I've seen new 996 have not impressed me.  The 993 is destined to 
become a classic! (if it isn't already)  It's the last of the air 
cooled Porsches.  

I wish that I could afford to order a new one before they go out of 
production.  :(.......
