Andrew Warren advise on chip repair was excellent, except I would not
recommend the "Rust Avenger" pen for primer.  I have used the product, and
had rust appear under the paint.  I have located a laboratory test report,
which evaluated steel paint test panels treated with Rust Avenger and
identical (rusty, but wire brushed clean) panels not treated.  The Rust
Avenger panels rusted much more quickly in the salt fog test.  If you have
rust in the chip, remove it, and use a good primer.  If you do not have
rust in the chip, it is likely the factory primer is still sound, and you
do not need to prime.  In any case, Rust Avenger is a water-based latex
product, and should not be used on car bodies.

Anyone interested in a copy of the test report, send SASE and I will send
them a copy.  The testing was done at an independent lab for the US
Government, so there is no commerical bias.
