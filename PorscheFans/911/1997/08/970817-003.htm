No.  When cold the oil guage typically doesn't register at all.  Once 
warm it should register 1/2 to 2/3 of full scale at idle.  If yours 
is all the way up to the top when warm (180F), you have too much oil 
in the sump tank and it is probably spilling out of the overflow.  
You should check your dipstick to make sure.  At idle, I like to keep 
mine just below the max fill line on the dip stick.  When the oil 
level pressure senders go bad, they tend to give erratic, jumpy 
readings.

That sounds about right.  At 180F, 3000 rpm, using 20W-50 Castrol 
oil, mine reads exactly 60 psi.

I am about to buy an ANSA O.E. type muffler.  The original from 
Porsche is quite expensive.  I would recommend staying with the stock 
system.  It performs quite well.  If you need new heat exchangers, 
the stainless steel ones made by SSI are regarded highly.
