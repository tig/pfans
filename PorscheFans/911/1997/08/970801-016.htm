Wow!

Wow!  Here are a couple of ideas that might help.  First spray the 
flywheel bolts with a good penetrating oil and let them sit over 
night.  Another thing that can help is to actually hit the top of the 
bolt firmly with a hammer.  It is possible that the heat from the 
flywheel has caused the bolts to sort of bond to the flywheel.  The 
impact from the hammer can help to jar it loose.  Another trick to 
get a little bit more leverage is to get a long extension onto your 
wrench.  This has worked very well for me when lug nuts are really 
tight on a wheel.  You can barely turn them with a normal lug wrench, 
but when you get a five foot extension on it, it breaks loose without 
any effort at all.

From what I've read about the 2.7 engines, the timeserts and special 
studs are a necessity.  Lately, I've been reading that people are 
recommending "Raceware" fasteners instead of the dilavar studs.  You 
can tell if you have dilavar studs by placing a magnet onto them.  
They aren't magnetic. 

Bruce Anderson's book, 911 Performance Handbook, goes into great 
detail as to which modifications are necessary to make the 2.7 engine 
bulletproof.  I would also recommend purchasing the factory 
maintenance manuals for your car.  They are expensive, but they are 
excellent and very descriptive.

The engine did not have inserts installed from the factory.

I would think that it would be pretty obvious....

When most people rebuild their Porsche engines they replace the 
pistons and cylinders.   I imagine that it everything is still within 
the factory's wear-limit then it would probably be ok to re-use them.

I hope that this was of some help.
