As some of you already know, twice a year, I put on driver instructional
events at Willow Springs Int'l Raceway and Buttonwillow under the
auspices of the MIT Club of Southern California (my alma mater).  The
next event is at Willow Springs on Monday, September 29, 1997.

This is a great opportunity for novices and experienced drivers alike. 
The event is on the big track, and we have exclusive use of the track all
day.  Participants bring their own cars, with no special safety equipment
required, other than a helmet.  I and other experienced racers, many from
the Porsche Owners Club, instruct all day, as well as provide rides at
speed in our cars.  There are exercises in the morning, with most of the
day being open track time in alternating fast and slow sessions.  You will
get at least 3 hours of track time, which is more than you would get all
weekend at most club events.  You can have as little or as much
instruction as you want, so for the experienced drivers, it's a great
chance for lots of open track/test time.

Cost for the day is $225, which includes coffee and danish in the
morning, lunch and drinks all day.  I always run a caravan up the
Angeles Crest and Angeles Forest Highways in the morning, which is a
great adrenalin warm up for the event!  Afterward, we go to dinner at
the local Mexican restaurant for some serious bench racing.

Lately, I have been getting about 30 participants, which is a great number
- enough so you get to drive with other cars on the track and have some
fun, but few enough that the track is not crowded at all (15 cars per
session is nothing at Willow, which is 2.5 miles around).  There is no
racing involved, and there are strict passing rules (only on the straights,
with a signal), so you need not worry (at least too much!) about hurting
your car.  In 5 years of running these events, there has never been any
serious damage to any car, and there are always fire and rescue
personnel present just in case.

All interested parties should contact me by return email or phone.  My
direct line at work is (310) 443-7520.  I hope to see you out there!
