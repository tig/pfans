A question to anyone who has driven from So. Cal to Las Vegas:

I will be driving from San Diego to Las Vegas Friday, returning on
Sunday. (My wife has convinced me to take her and our two sons to
Vegas). As her car is not air conditioned (hey, we live by the Ocean),
we will take my 911 whose air conditioning was just topped off with 2
libs of very expensive R-12 Freon.

Since this car has never been east of Riverside, with the air
condtioning on, what is a reasonable oil temperature I can expect (my
temp guage reads =B0C, not the usual white strip and red zone)?

Typical oil temps for my car is 200=B0C after cruising at 70 mph.

Any comments would be appreciated.
