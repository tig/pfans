My '76 911S has developed an appetite for chain tensioners and its
driving me 
nuts.  First a little history,  2.7L with 80k miles on the clock, no
thermoreactors, 
11 blade fan, external oil cooler added a few years ago.  Chain
tensioners 
upgraded in '82 with 930 parts, ramps, arms.  Early this year I had the
engine 
and transmission out to have syncros replaced and to find and fix oil
leaks.  The 
biggest oil leak turned out to be coming from the cam chain housing,
the nut 
that held the tensioner was very loose as a result (?) the support shaft
had been 
moving around and had worked the round holes into oblong holes and oil
was 
coming out of the housing at the hole for the shaft.  The cams were
pitted and a 
couple of the rockers also showed excessive wear.  I had the mechanic
send 
out the cams to be refurbished and find a used cover and housing.  We
agreed 
that, since I would eventually replace the engine with something newer 
preferably a 3.2L,  putting in pressure fed tensioners would be a waste
of 
money, besides the 930 tensioners worked fine for 15 years.  I am
beginning to 
regret that decision.  He replaced the O-rings in the original
tensioners and put 
it all together. I put the engine and trans. back in the car started it
up and every 
thing was fine, for about 5 minutes.  I trailered it to the mechanic,
he took out 
the bad unit and replaced it with another used one (it worked fine in
his race 
engine) it lasted about 5 min.  he purchased a new tensioner put it in -
same 
thing.  He ran the engine with the cover off to look at the way it all
worked as it 
ran, it looked OK.  He bought another new tensioner put it in and all
seemed 
fine, until yesterday.  All these problems have been with the right
side, the left 
side has worked fine. I don't want to put a lot of money in to a 80
thousand mile 
2.7L engine, I would rather save money to buy a 3.0 or 3.2 in a year or
two.    

Does anyone have any ideas as to why this could be happening?
Has anyone had problems with new 930 tensioners?
What would be a cost effective fix,  I would like to drive the car while
I take the 
time to come up with the dollars to buy a used 3.2.

Any and all input appreciated.
