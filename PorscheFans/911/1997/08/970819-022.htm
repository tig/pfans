I am in need of new tires and have come up with a problem/question.  I
purchased the car used and the previous owner said he had changed the
wheels.  Anyway, the tires are 205/225  50-15.  The question came from Tire
Warehouse who said that a 911 with 15" wheels should run 55s or 60s.  I
haven't had a chance to check my speedometer, but in the years I have had
the car, it seems close (though I have to convert kilometers to miles). 
So, can anyone tell me if a 911 should ever run 50-15s?  BTW, is there a
web site or FAQ that describes the proper sizes, offsets, etc for 911s? 
Thanks in advance.
