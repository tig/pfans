Brendan,

I'm looking at a '72 911E Targa for a restoration project, and my first
911 :-)

If you can help, I've got a couple of questions.

1.  The gentleman that has the car and I went for a test drive.  (He
uses the car as a daily driver.)  He informed me that the last time he
had the car in the shop, the mechanics inadvertently put the fuel filter
on backwards and it blew some garbage in the carburetors.  (Yes, I am
aware that the E originally had MFI instead of Webers.  That will
probably be part of the restoration.)  He said that the garbage in the
carburetors was causing the car to spit and sputter at low speeds. (I
heard this during the test drive.)  At higher speeds the sputtering
problem disappeared, however when you vigorously accelerated (you know
what I mean by vigorous), the car emitted some black smoke.  He told me
the smoke came from the problem with the carbs, and that the car had
never done that before the backward fuel filter.  Does that explanation
sound plausible?

2.  What would a good price range for this car?  It needs some body work
(i.e. some rust removal in the front pan and other small areas, new
front glass due to a small crack, top restoration, rubber kits around
the car, some interior restoration, etc.)  It would be a great project
car, I think.  Mechanically, I think the car is in pretty good
condition, except for the above problem.  He replaced the alternator,
the starter. rebuilt the master cylinder, etc.

Any help would be great.

Thanks,
Rick
