I'm in the middle of "upgrading" the Compressor and have discovered a
product
named "sanden".
Has anyone had an exposure to the product? good bad etc.
Also any suggestions we be greatly appreciated.
Final Note I'm looking for a '89 coupe BLK/BLK mint wide body turbo look. 
Or 90's C2 turbo look please keep your eyes and ears open.
Thanks,

Sanden used to call themselves Sankyo.  They make numerous AC compressors. 
All are swash-plate designs.  The model number seems to reflect the number
of cylinders.  Interestingly, the small units are more expensive.  My 1980
Mercedes came with a Sankyo 508.  Lasted 17 years.  I am putting a Sanden
507 on my 1970 911T.  They make a very small unit, the 505, which tempted
me since it is very light weight.  I was afraid I would regret it on a hot
Atlanta Summer day.

Sanden compressors are well-engineered, leak-free, smooth operating, and
durable.  You can also find them at a very good price (I payed $140 for the
507 three years ago.  I would recommend the 507 for a Porsche.  The 508
will cool any full-size car.  One last thing - they come with a bracket
that makes for easy exhange for the York four-bolt mounting system.  Makes
switching over as simple as replacing the York compressor with a new one. 
Let us know what you do.

Can't help with the car search.
