There are two types of water damage: salt water and fresh water. Salt water
damaged cars will rust from the inside out and along with other deterioration
can be considered a total loss. Fresh water damaged cars might be restored
especially if the engine wasn't running when the car was submerged. As
mentioned earlier the electrical system would be suspect in any case. There
was a Porsche making the rounds thru the auctions in the southeast a while
back. It was flood damaged and no mechanic could get it to run right. It went
from dealer to dealer each hoping to make a quick buck. I think it was a
beige 930. The original color was awful (what were the Stuttgart boys
thinking?) and I think the going rate was about $14,000. I've owned a few
P-cars and I'll reiterate that I think it's best to buy one with a known
history. Fixing up any Porsche is very expensive and is best performed by
someone with deep pockets. My 930 upfixin cost $13,772 for the engine alone.
You can now find me with a sign along the highway onramp "Will work for
Porsches".     Good luck
