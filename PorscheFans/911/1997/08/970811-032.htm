When the original CD broke 5 months ago, (it burned because a back speaker
shorted) I got an Alpine in-dash 3 cd changer. It's great, but there is a whining
noice(it follows the rpm) on certain radio channels. The installers checked
everything they could but can't seem to fix the problem.
They changed to a regular antenna but the problem didn't go away. When using the
CD all is fine. They finally installed an antenna filter which did help
a little, but it's still not good. Their last suggesstion was to send the
unit to Alpine for some tuning.


Since I almost only use the CD and this issue takes time, I've now given up
on this but figured that maybe someone on the list had similar problems.

I found out the hard way that my '86 911 with a windshield antenna had a
booster already installed at the factory.

If your C2/4 has a windshield antenna, make sure it is working properly or
that someone who changed the radio failed to wire up the power lead to the
booster as it's not marked on the radio schematic label or the wiring diagram
in the Haynes manual. 

As I recall, it was a black lead from the booster, which is not what I
associated with a power wire from my experience with American, British &
Japanese cars.

I brought 2 radios back before I ran into a installer who told me about the
booster. 

This was pre-Porschefans, of course.
