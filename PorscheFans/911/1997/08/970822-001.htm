Re Spiros Bouas's query about body shops in the Bay Area, I know of two
superb ones--Cecil Beach's Bodystyle (this from seeing their work) and
Del's Auto Body, whose owner I've met (and seen his own car--a 75
Carrera with a repaint that absolutely looks factory).  Del's is in
San Jose.  Bodystyle is around there too--Sunnyvale?  If the paint is
original on the car, I'd try for a match, or take the word of one of
the above places.  Repainting is much better than it used to be, and
they can virtually duplicate any finish--from slick to a little orange
peel, depending on what's there.

San Francisco is a lousy place to have a nice car.  Almost as bad as
NYC--no rust, but attitudes are just as bad.  My Cherokee was broken
into in broad daylight on a Sunday afternoon there.
