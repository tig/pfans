Some possibly stupid questions about my '88 Targa's wheels:

The wheel rims are polished (chromed?  Is there a difference?) to a
mirror-like finish.  The raised parts of the spokes are too.  The
inset portions are black.  The center caps are also polished, and the
crests are painted.

The questions:
-These wheels are original.  Are they Fuchs?
-Was the polishing original, or would this have been done after the
car left the factory?  I have no record of wheel work, so I was
assuming they factory polished, but I've never seen any other 911s
like this.
-Is polishing the same as chroming?
-One of the center caps is missing.  How do they attach/detach?
-I might want to trade these wheels for original equipment black
anodized wheels.  Condition being equal, are the polished ones worth
more than the black ones?  What are the prices of each type?

Thanks for your thoughts,
Colin O'Keefe
