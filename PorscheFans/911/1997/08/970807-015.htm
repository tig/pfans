Just a note to thank everyone who responded to my post.  I received over 20
responses that I will not attempt to summarize other than to say that most
agree that the first place to invest is seat time.  Chris Bennet noted: " .
.. . I would always compare the cost of any improvement against how many
track days it would be worth--it really clarifies your choices."  After
that first general point, and assuming safety (e.g., 5-pt harness,
extinguisher), opinions varied significantly.  As John Potter said: "There
are, in my opinion as a PCA instructor, many questions that need to be
answered first."  He listed many, but the moral of the story is: Buy track
time until you have reached your car's limit.  Modifications thereafter
will depend on you, the car, and the track(s).
