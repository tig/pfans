Michael, strongly suggest you buy a shop manual fro the 911.  Factory
is the best, but expensive.  There is a company called "Haynes" that
to me puts out the best manual, and they are relatively inexpensive. I
would think get them, read up, then decide what else you might need.

Valve adjustment isn't too hard, but you need a special tool to measure
the valve clearance (regular gap aguge won't fit in confines of engine).
Biggest probelm is access and vision; hard to see & get at all valves.

Shock replacement isn't bad in back, but in the front you need a special
tool or a big hefty pipe wrench to unscrew the strut insert (fits inside
the strut housing which is the part you see).

        P-fans, the more I talk to the "experts" the more I realize that
most maintinence and small things I could do myself and save big $. Take
for instance shocks, how hard can it be? Also, a vavle adjustment and spark
plug replacement, and oil change for 250$!! I want to spend the money on
the car not on the mechanic! I need your help, please send me all of the
detailed instructions on how to perform most basic service items; vavle
adjustments (tools needed and procedure) Shock swap (could save 200$)
tricks about spark plug replacement(heard their difficult, gapping
procedure) and any other service related item. Also looking for checklist
on service schedule( every 3,000 do this etc,etc,). I value this forum and
thanks for answering MLB.

                Ps. How much does good alignment usually cost?
