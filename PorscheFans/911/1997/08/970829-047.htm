Jim Naughton (Red 87 Targa) asks:  Can someone define bump steer ?

I'll try.  If a wheel changes direction when lifting over a bump, or
falling into a hole, while the steering wheel is held steady, and as a result
the car pulls or steers to one side or the other, you have bump steer.

It doesn't seem to be much of a problem in the rear.  Pre 993 cars have a
long arm with the wheel movement being pretty much tangent to its
circumference of motion.  Not really anything much you could do about it
anyway.  I take it on faith that that marvelous rear end on the 993s has it
all worked out.  Never noticed any in the few rides I have had in those
cars.

In the front, with ideal geometry the distance from the plane of the end of
the steering rack to parallel plane of the end of the steering arm out by
the wheel would remain the same throughout the total wheel travel, so
the wheel would stay pointed in exactly the same direction through
bumps and dips.  In reality, the tie rod end moves through an arc, which
has the same effect as lengthening or shortening the tie rod a bit, which
in turn means that the tire toes in or out a bit as it travels up and down. 
This is something of an oversimplification, as when the car is being
turned this is a three and not a two dimensional effect. 

As with the rear, if the tie rod pivot and the steering rack are
about in the same horizontal plane, so that the tire is mostly tangent to 
the arc the tie rod describes, this effect should be at a minimum.  Again,
this is a simplification, as the motion of the McPherson strut affects
things.

What does this mean to you as a practical matter?  Well, the factory took
all this into account when it designed the car, so there isn't much bump
steer (in fact, you don't notice any such effect).  However, if you lower
your car way below the factory's specs, then you will have altered the
geometry enough that you may create noticeable bump steer.  You can
correct this by moving the steering rack up so that the tie rod is back to
the same angle to the wheel that it "should" be.  You can move the
steering rack up by using longer bolts with washers between the rack
and its mount.  How thick should these washers be?  Well, how low is
your car.  But in practice, most of us just put in the inexpensive spacers
we buy for the purpose from Automotion or one of the other catalog
houses and call it good enough.  Seems to work fine.

How low does your car have to be before you need to worry about any
of this?  Well, my theory is that factory designed the cars for "Euro" ride
height, and then just raised them up with the built in adjustment systems
to meet "US" ride height, and neither height had a bump steer problem.  I
have never heard of the Euro cars having spacers installed at the
factory to make this right (then again there is a lot I've never heard of
despite a dozen years of listening), and given our fascination with our
cars I am pretty sure someone would have sold these things as Euro
(like the "Turbo" tie rods) if it was something the factory did.  If this
theory is right, then if you lower your car to "Euro" specs, you shouldn't
have a bump steer problem.

My estimate is that bump steer is more of an issue for demon racers with
dedicated track cars who are trying to squeeze out the last small fraction
of grip in dealing with bumps while cornering with some body roll and
weight transfer already.  They are the ones tempted by the nice $300
plus spherical bearings with a bolt in place of the tie rod ends.  Or with
raising the spindles, or heating and bending the steering arms if they can
find someone who can do it without weakening anything.  I'll bet you
aren't there yet.

But hang in there.  You will be.  It's contagious.

Walt Fricke (thinking he ought some day to measure the bump steer on
his 68  based race car, since all the books talk about it, and he might find
a new place to spend money even though he doesn't "feel" any bump
steer.  How low is his car?  Lowered until it bottomed a lot on the track,
then raised up so it didn't bottom as often.  Pretty scientific)
