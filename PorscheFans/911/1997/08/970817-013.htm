A few days ago someone posted a call for help on cleaning cloudy looking
Fuchs wheels.  I have this problem on my '86 911 Carrera also.  After trying
unsuccessfully myself to remove the cloudy parts, I have called some of the
refurbishing shops.  They tell me that the clear coat is gone and that the
wheels need to be cleaned, reanodized and clear coated.  One shop is asking
$140 per wheel plus shipping to California for complete restauration.  A
local place will clean and reanodize, but it would be up to me to find a
paint shop to repaint the center and apply a clear coat.  They want @82 per
wheel + whatever it would cost for repainting. Does anyone have any
experience with this???
