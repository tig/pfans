In '69 I fell in love with the 911 Targa and asked for one for XMas. Got
one 2 1/2 inches long.  In '97 I finally got hold of a real live one
after going thru Fiats, Alfas, MG's, 240-280 Z's, Jags, and sundry
"family cars. Ah heaven made from Tutonic Steel.

Auto is a 75 911s Targa with added large whale tail.  Have had the
engine and tranny reworked and brought back up to snuff, now it is time
for working the suspension. Car is currently used for street driving but
would like to be able to partake in driver ed and poss. autox in near
future.

As with most folks have to work within a budget.  Am looking at
addingadjustable front and rear 22mm sway bars 23mm front torsion and 27
or 28mm rear torsion. Would like to replace one then the other at later
times to spread out the cost.  Which one to look at doing first? Have
not decided on shocks, boge, biels, konis? Need suggestions on springs
or how to test to see if they really do need replacing.

Any and all suggestions more than welcome and appreciated.

Thanks from a newbe to your list
Tom
