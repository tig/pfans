I need the space.  I don't need two 911's. And I find I don't
use this one very much.  I only license it for the summer,
and then only drive on days with zero probability of rain.
In Seattle that means I use it two days a year.  Even so, it
kills me to do this.  It's like selling a child.

Good things:  
1972 911E Targa with all factory installed S options 
including S trim, front spoiler, front and rear sway bars, factory A/C.  
Body is rust free and straight.  Perfect example
of an early '70's 911.  All original, even the tool kit.  No smoke.
No rain.  Originally it was a Calif. car.  I'm the second owner and I
'imported' it to Seattle where I virtually completely rebuilt and
restored it.   New paint ( PPG base coat/clear coat catalyzed urethane) 
over bare metal (epoxy primed, of course). White w/black interior.  
Always garaged and covered since rebuild. New carpet, mats.  New front and
rear Targa
seals.  Targa top rebuilt with new headliner and top.  Lots of new rubber
trim. Etc.
It has conventional (not hydropneumatic) suspension with new Sport Bilsteins,
 
new bushings.  New clutch, throw-out bearing, pressure plate and
resurfaced flywheel.  New gas tank.  New steering rack.  All brake calipers
rebuilt, including master cyliner.  New brake pads.  Engine has been 
completely overhauled/rebuilt 4K miles ago, and
has all new bearings, rings, timing chains, guides, rebuilt tensioners,
and probably other stuff I can't remember.  Heads have been rebuilt.
 Basically, 
it's a new engine, almost a new car.  

Not so good things:
Two small cracks in the usual place on the dash.  Steering wheel should be
recovered.  Otherwise interior is pretty perfect.  Seats are the leather high
backed type
from a slightly later vintage, but I have the original low-back seats and
they, 
of course, go with the car.  They need to be recovered. Driver's side heat
exchanger is
is new SSI, but passenger's side is the original one.  It's in fine shape,
but I think
if I kept the car I'd replace it if for no other reason then it annoys me
every time
I look under the car to see one shiny clean one, and one kind of old ratty
one.
It has the original style valve covers, and there is the usual drop or two of
oil on the floor
if you let it sit for a few days.   Turbo valve covers would eliminate that,
but the
drip is so small it seemed more worthwhile to keep the car original than to
change
the covers. 

Asking $10,500.
