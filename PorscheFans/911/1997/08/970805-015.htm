The two things to look at first are tires and restraining systems.  A set
of R compound tires will do wonders for your lap times, although you may
want to increase the size of your rear swaybar along with this change.
However, don't underestimate the value of a 5-pt. harness.  Even without
a proper racing seat, the harness will hold you in place much better than
the stock seatbelt, allowing you to concentrate less on holding on and
more on controlling the car.  Also, having the harnesses (one for your
instructor as well) installed should cost you 1/2 to 2/3 of what the
tires will cost you.
