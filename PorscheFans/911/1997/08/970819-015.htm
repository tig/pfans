A question for the list if I may.  I recently came across a 911S of
interest.  It was a frame-up construction in Germany in the early 80s. 
The builder put a 911S body on it and put in a 2.0L E-type engine.  

The machine has rust underneath in the floor pan areas, both left and
right side.  It has rust in the footwell front of the passenger side. 
There is minor rust at the rear swing-out windows edges at the back. 
There is blistering of paint on the panel behind the exhaust and there
is bubbling of the body paint particularly in the door areas.  

There is also some rust on the seat holding brackets on both driver and
passenger sides.

The rear fenders have been flaired slightly, looks well done.

The engine is supposed to have about 20,000 miles on it.  It now has
twin 3-brl Webers.  The machine when started cold was puffing slightly
light blue smoke from the exhaust.  The puffing ceased when the engine
was at normal operating temperature.  The tailpipe was black inside. 
The mechanic said he had been working to adjust the carbs.

This is a nice looking machine that needs TLC.  Question is:  Do frame
up construction distract from the value of the car?  Would an E-type
engine in an S-type body reduce the value.  Assuming the rust can be
cleaned up reasonably, approx. value of such a machine.  

Thanks in advance for any assistance.
