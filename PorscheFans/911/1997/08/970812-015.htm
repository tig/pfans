Josh,

If your trombone "cooler" is hot than your external thermostat is opening.  
The thermostat you are referring to is just in front of your right rear 
wheel.  Take a peek under the fender and you will see it.  It is not 
connected in any way to your AC.  I would think turning your AC on would 
raise your oil temp. if anything.  If you are seeing 260 degrees it is time 
to pitch that trombone cooler and get a real one.

Hi Pfans,

Could higher than wanted (260 degrees @ 90 + mph for 2 hours) oil temps = 
be attributed to a stuck or
faulty thermostat?  I felt the trombone cooler after a 220 degree reading=  
(long cruise pegged at 75
mph) and it was very hot.  Is the thermostat connected in any way to the = 
air conditioner?  Weeks ago
I thought I noticed a sudden drop in oil temp after engaging the air = 
conditioner, this was a night
and possibly the temps air temp had also dropped.  Is there a connection = 
between the two?

Would these questions be covered in Bruce Anderson's, Porsche 911 = 
Performance Handbook?

Thanks again for all the help.
