    Bill:

    They'd probably give you an "A" for effort and then explain that
    the REAL reason has nothing to do with chemical reactions in the
    rubber.

    If you think about a race tire's life-cycle (months spent sitting
    on a shelf in an oxygen-containing environment, followed by three
    hours on a racetrack inflated with either air or nitrogen),
    you'll see that the gas with which one inflates his tires really
    won't have much of an impact on the chemical bonds within the
    rubber.

    Here's the deal:

    The Ideal Gas Law says that if all else remains equal, pressure
    is proportional to temperature.  The Law makes it easy to
    predict a tire's hot temperature if you know its cold
    temperature... Specifically, it allows you to fill two tires to
    the same cold pressure and be reasonably sure that they'll both
    reach the same hot pressure (if they both rise to the same
    temperature, of course).

    However... Air contains water vapor, which makes it less than an
    "ideal" gas.  Therefore, the pressure doesn't rise linearly with
    the temperature, so it's harder to predict the hot-versus-col
    pressures... Especially if there's a different percentage of
    water vapor in each tire.
