Hi Joe

In my experience wear on the inside fronts is very pronounced with any
toe out.  I like to run a little toe out because it makes the car turn
in quicker. I have swiched my fronts right to left to even out the
wear.  I have heard that this can cause balace problems but I have not
noticed any ill effects.
