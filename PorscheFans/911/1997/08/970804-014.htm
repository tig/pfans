recent inquiry about importation of porsche into usa......i see another
member mentioned  many of the problems associated with this......it has been
many years since i imported my turbo but i recall that there was at one time
some kind of exemption for american citizens to import non conforming
vehicles into country without meeting specs...was a one timer and car had to
be 15 yrs old as i recall.....i also remember some discussion about 10 yrs
ago of that being changed...so there's something else to inquire
about.....also there is always canada but that is a completely different
story........the goverment's position back then concerning new vehicles was
basic " here's the specs....we cannot tell you how to meet
them".......regards, david
