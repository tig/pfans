After trashing my street tires at a driver's ed event last weekend I've 
decided to invest in a set of R1s.  The way I see it is I have two 
options.   Option 1 would be to put the largest R1's possible on my 6/8 
x 16" stock wheels and then buy some aftermarket  7/9 x 17" for the 
street.  The advantage here is that I get cool 17"ers for the street.  
The downside is that I don't end up with lots of rubber on the road for 
the track due to the width of the stock rims (I could probably run 
225/50's and 245/45's).  I'd also have to try and sell my existing tires.

The second option would be to by 7.7/9 x 17" aftermarket wheels for 
track use.  My concern is over the quality of the $200-$250 per rim 
wheels.  Are they strong enough for track use?  What about roundness 
and balance for high speed (130+ mph)?  I'm really not in a position to 
drop the big money for $500 each rims.

Any recommendations from folks who've been there?  Any particular 
brands preferred?  I'm looking at the Borbet C2-Turbo replicas or the 
MSW 55Cs from the Tire Rack.
