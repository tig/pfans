Hi everyone.  Does anyone know the differences in features from the 1987 and
the last generation model year 1988 Porsche 911?  In general, which style
hold their value better, please list in ascending order if anyone
knows....coupe, targa, or cabrio? I have been looking for several months
now, and finally seriously looking at a 1988 targa, but it has 15" wheels
with 195/70's in front and 205/60's in rear...is that a strange setup as all
the 911s I've seen have 16" wheels?  The undercarriage seem to have surface
rust...is that common?  Is it because the previous owner never undercoated
the undercarriage....is there a remedy to this surface rust?  Another
question, after test driving this 911, I noticed driving over a pot-holed
roadway, the suspension was very rough, you could feel every hole...is that
normal or the Porsche needs new shocks (it doesn't nose-dive on braking)?  

Thank you, soon to be new porsche owner (just can't wait)
