Tom, my attempt to answer your questions is below:

1) What is the correct tire inflation pressure?  The tires
are Dunlop D40 M2's P205/55ZR16 (front) P225/50ZR16 (rear).
On the sidewall of the tires it reads "max 46 psi", however,
in the car's owners manual it says to inflate the fronts to
(cold) 29 psi and the rears to 36 psi, which I'm doing... is
this correct?

Follow the owner's manual.  The "max 46 psi" is legaleze BS, I believe
mandated by the gummint.

2) According to a speedometer calibration test the speedo is
10% fast across the entire tested speed range (which was from
25 to 85 mph).  For example, at an indicated speed of 55, the
actual speed was 50.  Doesn't this mean that the car also shows
10% more miles than it actually has?  If so, how do I fix this
since the number of miles on a car directly affects resale value?

This error I believe is reasonable for all 911's up till the C2/C4 (at
least my 993 is dead accurate).  My old '76 and '84 911s all had
an error of about 10%.  I think that Stoddard's has a service to
recalibrate these units, if you tell them how far they're off.  Try them 
at 216/951-1040.
