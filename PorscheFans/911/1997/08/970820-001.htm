Dennis's question about 185/70 tires and replacements has been around
for a while in effect, since there's no such thing as a
high-performance tire in that size any more.  The closest is the
195/65 x15 that Yokohama makes--they even made it specially to
accommodate the need, and I've seen it listed in the AVS line, and in
the A008P line which was made for Porsche.  Other than that, the
205/60 x15 will work, and that's what I have in the A008R.  You might
want to roll your fender lips as a precaution.

Now that the 032R is the latest thing in sticky tires, I wonder if
there's any available size that will fit on older 911s with 6-inch
wheels.  225/50, maybe, but that would need 7-inch rims, I'd think.  I
haven't been to an autocross in 2 years, so I don't know what the
experts are running these days.
