I have a 1972 911T for sale, car is in great condition, was
repainted 8 years ago, to the original Leaf Green color, has a 
tan interior.

I have the service records back to 1989, the car was originally from PA, 
and has been in VA since 1989.  While in PA, the underside of the car 
was coated with rustproofing, therefore the is very little rust, if any on 
the car.  Since 1989, when the car was repainted, it has lived its life in 
a garage.  Most of the previous owners did not drive the car much.  Since 
I purchased the car in 1994, I have driven it, Autox it, and Drivers Ed it.  

The previous owner replaced the MFI pump, and since then I have had to 
rebuild the motor due to an exhaust valve dropping.  The engine rebuild, 
included updating the case for the bypass oil modification, installing 
updated 930 valve seats, pressure feed chain tensioners, wider chain 
wheel supports, chains,  clutch, pressure plate, and stainless steel heat 
exchangers, rebuilt distributor, and rebuilt alternator.

Has all the "S" guages (clock does not work), and exterior trim, 
5 6x15 Fuchs, front and rear factory anti-roll bars, 5-speed.  The 
rear torsion bars have been replaced with 26mm bars from a 911 
Turbo, 930 spring plates, rebushed front and rear suspension,  
rebuilt brake calipers, stainless steel brake lines (have OEM lines 
in a box), Turbo Tie Rods, Steering rack spaces, Koni shocks, and
the ride height has been set.

The few small problems that the car has are the normal cracks
on top of the dash, the map pockets sag, has one split seam in 
the drivers seat, and the car includes the normal stone chips 
under the front bumper, and on the lower part of the hood.

This is a very clean, nice looking and great driving early 
model 911.  Asking price $12,500.00
