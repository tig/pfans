Hi Jim,


My parents '87 911 also consumed oil at a high rate. I couldn't find a
leak so I suggested that they take the car to the shop. The mechanic
also couldn't find a leak, so he let the car idle for 1/2 hour. When he
came back and looked more carefully, he noticed oil leaking from the oil
lines to the pressurized chain tensioners. It was hard to notice, but
after the fix oil consumption had dropped. That's probably not the
problem, but it is worth a look

Subject: oil consumption

As a new porsche owner of an 87 Carrera, 40k on the clock, I question
the oil consumption.  Around town, avg. trip 12 miles, 1qt./150 miles. 
Highway long trip 1qt./500 miles.  Very occasionally a little smoke on
startup (cold). No leakage at all visable.  Exhaust pipe color very dark
grey, not sooty.  Thoughts ?
