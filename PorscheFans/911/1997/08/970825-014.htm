I just installed a Carrera tail on my '87.  It is a factory tail from a '92
RSA,
and has the "fine" screen that Joe mentioned.  It also has a double set of
louvers - the external fiberglass ones and an internal set of metal ones below
the screen.  There is a Porsche crest which is visible when the deck lid is
raised.

The tail is attached with ten bolts.  The bolts are passed through the deck
lid from below, and engage clip nuts in the tail.  Several of the front bolts
had washers between the deck lid and tail that acted as shims.  The rear bolts
pass through a back-up plate that spans the width of the lid in two sections.

The AC unit on the lid must be removed to access the front bolts.  It is
attached to the lid hinges at the sides, and supported in the center at
the rear.  Nothing special about removing, other than the usual cautions
about stressing the tubes and connection fittings and creating AC leaks.  I
used
a couple pieces of scrap carpeting to rest my cooler on top of engine and
protect it from dropped tools.

The tail is pretty heavy, maybe 15 or 20 lbs, and is a bit awkward when
balanced
on the lid with bolts removed, so be careful with the last one.  Once removed,
you'll be amazed at all of the internal parts.  The screens and grills are all
bolted together with tiny machine screws. I'm sure they could be removed for
cleaning, but I resisted the temptation to disassemble everything.  This
time...
I didn't notice any rivets.


Cheers,

- Brad
