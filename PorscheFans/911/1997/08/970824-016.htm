Hello, I'm Rich Brown and live in the Newark, De area. I have all my work
done by a Porsche 911 specialist that lives just over the line in
Maryland-near Fairhill. He's the Porsche Club Racing technical
advisor-national. His name is Harry Hall and has his own business in a shop
at his home. He is a genuine expert on 911's and  914's. Harry is reasonable,
knowledgable, and absolutely honest. He is meticulous in his approach to
Porsches and has always demonstrated the highest integrity in his work and
pricing. He does my routine maintenance  and last spring rebuilt my
transmission, replaced the clutch and half shafts.  I wouldn't hesitate to
recommend him to anybody. His location may be a bit of a stretch for
you--distance wise-but, believe me, it's worth it-a number of people from
other states bring their Porsches to Harry to work on. Harry can be reached
at 410-398-8784
