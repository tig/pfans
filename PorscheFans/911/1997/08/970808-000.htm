I do not know if this applies in all states, but it does
here in Texas. You may file for a road tax refund from the
state for any gasoline or fuel used off-road.  This includes
diesel, gasoline and other fuels.

As you know, when you buy gas at the local station, there
are road use taxes built into the price.  Here in Texas it
is something like 30-40 cent/gallon.  If you use this fuel
off-road, you are entitled to a refund from the state.

All you have to do is file a simple 1 page form with the
state comptrollers office.  You can call them and have them
sent to you.  Keep your receipts because they will audit you
the first time you do this.

I used to do this for boat gas I bought at the pump.  I
would get back maybe $80 at the end of a year.  There is no
"tax" year so you can file whenever you want but the
purchase cannot be more than a year before the filing date.

Remember, this is only for gas bought at a filling station. 
Gas bought at a marina or at the track probably does not
have the tax included so that means those guys are making
that much more on a gallon.  If you do a lot of track time
this could add up, and you are entitled to this refund, so
ask for it!
