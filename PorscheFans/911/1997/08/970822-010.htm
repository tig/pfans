> Hi Stan:
> Assuming everything else is up to par I'd suspect a problem in your
> fuel injection system.
> Your CIS and mine are similar with the exception of the additions of
> the mixture control using Lambda (which I think you have).
> The basics are that the engine is started rich via the cold start
> valve and lower control pressure to the fuel distributor.  as the
> engine warms up the control pressure rises and leans the engine.  On
> yours there is also a aux. air valve the comes into play on a hot
> engine throttle down to burn off excess fuel and the Lambda mixture
> control.  From your description including the backfire you could be
> going very lean on throttle down and stalling the engine.  If I've got
> it right the engine will restart but will die after a couple of min
> running at idle.  You could be getting too much air via the aux. air
> valve which you can disable or have a system adjusted to lean hot or
> have a failure in the Lambda control or... the list goes on.
> If it where me I'd start with a pressure check first and then go
> through the basic adjustments for the fuel distributor making sure
> things like the Lambda control are functioning and then set the
> mixture.   If you don't or can't get to that you could shade tree it
> and richen the mixture about a 1/4 turn and see what happens.
> To my mind the CIS system is pretty elegant in its functional
> simplicity, but everything must be up to snuff or you'll be chasing
> your tail forever.  It took me quite a while to come to terms with
> mine but now it performs fine and I have one less system in the car
> that has a name that starts with "Mother @#$".
