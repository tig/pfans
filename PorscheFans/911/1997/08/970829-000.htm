Pholks,
I am trying to buy a 996 for early delivery in the UK. I have had four
Porsches but never a new one. It seems impossible to get delivery within 12
to 18 months. I cannot really believe that all are sold before the car has
been seen in the flesh. I suspect speculators in the trade who have the
right contacts get given cars so a premium is made and the dealer gets a
brown envelope with cash in it. Yes I am cynical.

Does anyone know the estimated production figures for the first few years
of 996 manufacturing. The dealers are telling me only about 500 cars will
come into the UK thats about half the usual 911 quantity.

Also how do Porsche schedule right hand drive cars in the production. Are
they built individually or is it one week in ten they make right hand drive.

It seems the dealers are more interested in 993 used sales at inflated
prices than new car sales. I was offered a 95 993 coupe at =A360000, thats
USD90000.

After many years of building up to buying a new 911 its a bit of a
disappointment, I think dealers are getting greedy again, I still remember
what happened to them in the late 80's. Maybe I will go and get a F355, oh
yes sir we can give you a car now, its our demontrator at full list price
and 6000 on the clock. If you want a really new car thats 12 months waiting.

Never have this problem with a Ford.

Antony
