In a message dated 97-08-20 10:07:23 EDT, you write:

<< I see considerable more rear pad  wear than fronts. To the tune of 2 x
rears for 1 x fronts.>>

Lou, this is an indication that something is wrong because the opposite
should be true considering the brake bias is 54% front vs 46% rear under full
braking. Perhaps:
* the rear "M" calipers are sticking (rebuild time - also, a seal can go bad
and a piston will stick but this is easliy diagnosed considering that this
will show uneven brake pad wear). Also you should measure width of rotors to
be sure they are within the correct tolerances. 
* the hydraulic balance is incorrect (bad or incorrect brake lines, brake
pressure regulator is bad). 

<< How do you like the drilled rotors? Advantages?>>

I love 'em, have gotten great life (5 years on my last set) and no problems
(since getting the right ones). Properly drilled rotors (there are a lot of
bad ones out there I can only recommend those sold by AJR in San Diego)
prevent gas build up between the pads and the rotor, keep the pad surface
fresh from glazing and help the rotors dissipate heat even better. 
 
 << Considering going to 930 brakes but they are $$$>>

It would appear that the cost differential between 930, 928S4 and Big Reds
has narrowed to the point that if you don't mind having to run 17" wheels the
Big Reds are the way to go now. But everyone seems to forget that the master
cylinder and pressure regulator all have to be changed as well. There are
also some custom Brembos which are available from some hot shops like Vision
Motorsports here in SoCal. 

Hope this proves helpful!
