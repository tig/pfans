The oil level is supposed to be up to the fill hole in the side of the
transmission.  There is a drain hole at the bottom.  I just add fluid,
while the car is on flat ground, until it just begins to run back out of
the fill hole.

Your leak sounds like the pilot shaft seal.  There is a garter spring on
the seal that can be disturbed, but if the trans was in the car the entire
time you went through this, it is likely not the spring.

It happens with some polymers that they are conditioned by one type of
fluid, and then are seriously degraded by a new fluid.  I always stick with
the same brake and transmission fluids because I find the seals degrade
when I change.

Replacing the seal is not difficult, but does require removing the
transmission from the car.  Hope high level is the problem.  Good luck.
