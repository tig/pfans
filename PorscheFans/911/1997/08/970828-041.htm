i saw a guy who did that mod on a 993-RSR.. he used 3 of the analog meters
that measure head temps (2 per gauge) it looked easy .. he tapped an area
right in the top most part of the exaust manifold and screwed the senders
into that... the wires ran away from the manifold.. i think that the exaust
temp there is just as telltale as the temp of the heads (for management)
you need to find screw-in type senders...


>Where exactly should I hook up the cyl head temp sensors?
>How easy from under the car w/o engine removal?

since the manifold is on the bottom of the car it should be simple... no
need to drop engine.

> Which sensors to use?  Are there generic sensors I can get
>or are they specific to the VDO gauge in impedance/resistance etc?

totally specific... find one of the old senders if you can and get a
measurement of it's impedence at a known temp (i.e. 70 deg's) with a
multimeter then find another sender with the same spex.

>Is there any value in doing this to more accurately monitor engine
>temp rather than going by oil temp?

first, why???? i think cyl. head temp is pretty anal, especially if you
monitor all 6.....
exaust temp is pretty good as well....

you may want to also put a relay in line if you take it off batt. directly
as to turn it off when the car is off, or take it off a switched acc. line,
like the stereo....
