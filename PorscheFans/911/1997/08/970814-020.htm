Spiros, one question:

How can changing the FRONT tire size change the speedo error on a
911?  Every one I have seen uses the REAR tires (i.e., differential) to
drive the speedo.

 This is an excellent point. The front tires on my 85 911 were 205 50 16,
 i.e. 5% smaller (on each side of the rim) than what is I believe correct.
 A 205 55 16 fixes this problem. My speedo seemed to be off, and I'm sure
 as a result the miles on the car were off as well...
