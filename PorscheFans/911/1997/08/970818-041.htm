I've been working on adjusting and aligning the suspension on my '87.  Have
gone through 1 iteration of ride height adjustment, looks good but now the
corner balance is somewhat off (it pulls slightly to the right).  So more
iterations are coming this weekend.

As I was doing the work, I came up with a few questions maybe the group here
might have some insight into.

1. Torques?  The Haynes manual has a few torques listed but is quite
incomplete, and implies that there is some variation on bolt types and torques
on later model cars (I'm talking all pre-89 here in any case).

Does anyone have the torques readily available for the other suspension
components?  Specifically:

	- height adjustment bolts (fixed to adjustable spring plate bolts);
		these are the 2-24mm nuts on the outside of the spring
		plates with the 36mm bolts on the inside
	- torsion bar cover bolts (3 of them)
	- sway bar and drop link bolts, plus sway bar bracket bolts
	- toe and camber adjustment bolts
	- just for good measure, bottom shock absorber mounting bolt

BTW, SmartCamber has a ride height adjustment wrench for $35 that I bought
today after my difficulties holding the very thin 36mm bolts in place
(essentially impossible).  Give them a visit at http://www.smartcamber.com for
more info.  Since I live a few minutes away I dropped by this morning and
talked to Bill who handles racing parts.  They are definitely serious Porsche
people and own various racing models.

2. Weight adjustment guidelines.  I am going to go to a place that will do a
quick 4-corner weight measurement too see what the weights are now.  After
reading various sources on the subject (best one I've run across so far is
Puhn's book, look at page 70), it appears that the optimal way to adjust corner
weights is to move around the car and fix 1/4 of the weight error on each wheel
in turn (the weight error should be exactly the same on each wheel although
reversing in sign from one wheel to the next as you go around the car in a
circle).  So if the weight error is, say, 80 pounds too high on the LR/RF
wheels vs. the ideal weights, I should increase weight (raise body height) 20
pounds each on RR and LF wheels, and reduce weight (lower body) by 20 pounds
each on LR and RF wheels.

Now finally, the question: is there a rough guideline for "if I change the ride
height (or torsion bar angle, or some other measure) by XX, I'll
{increase/decrease} the weight on this wheel by YY pounds" (assuming small
changes)?  For example, I scribed some lines on the rear spring plates marking
the adjustment range I was working with and this is an easy way to make an
accurate rear adjustment.  If I can say "raising the spring plate 1 degree will
reduce weight by 40 pounds" I can get a good first cut at getting to an even
balance.

Similar question for the fronts -- a full turn of the adjusting bolt will cause
ZZ pound difference, for example.

All bars, etc., are stock for the '87; no sport package, etc.

Thanks for any help,
