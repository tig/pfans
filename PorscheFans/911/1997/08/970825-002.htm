Hi All,

Well, judgement day was last Tuesday after 1 continuance and thoroughly
pissing off the DA, the Commandant of Troop C of the NC Highway Patrol, and
their legal department.  I'll try to make this short:

After the ticket, I joined the National Motorists Association, NMA, and
rented their legal defense kit.  I already had a 1 point (less than 10 mph
over posted limit) violation from last Labor Day.  BTW, _what_ is it with
these holidays?!  I rented the NMA's Legal defense kit and followed their
"program".  I requested discovery via registered letter from the NCHP and
the DA for a number of items (12) they suggested.  The Commandant responded
the next day by phone to say that he would not respond to my request.  The
DA never responded.  I phoned the Commandant to tell him that I wanted his
response in writing--he declined.  I phoned the DA's office and left a msg
for the prosecutor asking for a response to my request--no return call
received.  

I went to court and got a continuance on my original trial date.  Something
else the NMA suggests.  While I was there, I picked up some subponea forms
from the clerk.  Filled them out with the original request items and filed
them with the clerk to serve on the Commandant.  He did _NOT_ like this.
Hey, I figured that since he had responded to the earlier request, he must
be the custodian of records, so I let him have it.

I had a copy of a filed affadavit mailed back to me within 5 days.  It was
an objection to the subponea worded in undecipherable legalese.  I don't
think even they knew what it meant.  Actually they didn't respond to each
item, they just bitched that discovery is not done in a traffic court case,
and if it were, I cannot compel a state official to produce evidence by
subponea.  A crock of sh*t in my book, I couldn't find any law or judicial
rule that would deny me these rights (that are accorded to any other defendant).

So I hired a lawyer.  He said we would continue as long as it took for
everyone to forget what a trouble maker I was.  The court date of 7/19 came
and went.  My wife got a call from the attorney two days later saying that I
received a PJC and there would be no points assessed against my liscense or
insurance unless I earned another ticket within three years. 

Seems the lawyer had a colleague to whom the DA owed a favor.  I was the
"lucky" recipient of the payback.  I wonder who was previously sacrificed to
warrant this...  Oh well, $370.00 later, and no insurance increase I suppose
this is the best I could have hoped for.

Satisfied But Cynical,

-Bill
