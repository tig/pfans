i ordered the faces from nrauto.... i was dissapointed.. i sent 'em
back.... they are not actually aluminum.. they are silver paint over a
translucent sheet... kind of like the originals... the porsche ones are
silver paint as well .. if you know about paints... metallic pigments are
globby and think.. the "flow" is lame -therefore the numerals where not too
crisp .. overall they looked dodgey.. i was charged a 15% restock fee as
well..  the work to install them is not too hard with a steady hand... i
would guess that nrauto has okay faces in other colours .. stay away from
the metallic inks... even the porsche silver ones look substandard..
