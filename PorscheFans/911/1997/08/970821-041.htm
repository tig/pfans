Andre, you mentioned that you had the system pressurized for two hrs. I
believe but you didn't mention if you ahd the system leak checked with
an electronic leak detector or not. This the best and really only
reliable way to detect a leak of R12 or R134a. The dye that is used to
find leaks is not always good because not all leaks will carry oil out
with them and the dye tends to thin out the oil. Does there tend to get
a streak of oil over the a/c pulley on the deck lid ?  This would
indicate a leak at the seal which can be hard to find some times. But if
it leaks out in two weeks, it is a pretty good size leak, ck. carefully
at all of the joints of the condenser and the evaporator where copper
and aluminum are soldered together as this is a very difficult seal to
make. to check the evap. sniff at the drain hose at the bottom of the
case( from under the car )

Roger
