Greg , We have a Teak wheel dated 1967 . It has 4 spokes and the Porsche
crest on the horn button. Is yours a factory wheel? We sanded the wood
ourselves and brushed on 8 coats of  varnish for hardwood floors. We sanded
in between every second coat and sprayed on the last coat. It came up just
like new and we're very pleased with it. We are presently painting the
metal spokes flat black and then we're all ready to bolt it on!
Chrissy and Dave
