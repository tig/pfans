I am also having fun driving my 78 930 everyday for 3 months.
There is no problem at all! Engine oil is eaten up quite quickly on my
car.
I have to constantly feed it a qt of oil every month. That's about it.
After I join a new company, I bought a Honda Civic AT to commute from
home to work. 
For a few reasons:
- my new company doesn't have the cool in-door parking structure anymore
- new company is located closer from home, and mostly local traffic
- my parents are coming to States for visit soon, a 4 door, 4 passenger
car is better
- my wife is just learning how to drive, an automatic Civic is a easier
to handle (but I will use it for now).
- Gas mileage is quite poor on 930 (it is normal to any SuperCar), Civic
will save me some money

Go 930 Go!
