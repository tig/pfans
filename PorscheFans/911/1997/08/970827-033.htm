     Hi,
     
     I've got a few questions, thanks in advance for ny answers you might 
     be able to give.
     
     1.  My 1971 911T Targa needs a passenger side vent window (just the 
     glass).  Does anyone have this piece of glass laying about that they'd 
     be willing to sell for a reasonable price?  I've caled around to a few 
     places, and they all want $100+ for it.  This seems excessive.  I'd be 
     willing to pay $25 + shipping if anyone has one laying around that 
     they don't need.
     
     2.  My clock, dome light and glove box light don't work.  I checked 
     the fuse, and sure enough it was missing.  I popped a new fuse in and 
     it blew out (literaly) in like 3 seconds.  I disconnected everything 
     that should be connected to that fuse (the 3 things I listed above) 
     but it still blows it out.  Obviosuly I have a short, but I'm not sure 
     where it might be.  Any suggestions?
     
     3.  I got a quote on a complete tuneup for approximately $350.  
     Includes, oil, oil filter, air filter, plugs, distributor, points, 
     adjustment of the zenith carbs, and valve cover adjustments.  Does 
     this seem reasonable?  (The mechanic is close to my house, and did a 
     good job on an alternator replacement)
     
     4.  Has anyone gotten the Mach 1 speaker housing for the back of their 
     Porsche?  How does it sound?  Worth the money?  ($479)  Does it look 
     nice installed?
     
     If you could send any answers you might have to me at ggg@capgroup.com 
     I'd appreciate it.  I don't get the list reguraly anymore.
     
     Thanks!
     
     Garth
     71 911T Targa
