You know, Spiros, there's an old saying: "If it wasn't for bad luck, you
wouldn't have any at all!"  That really sucks, but I'm not responding just to
tell you that.

If you have any willingness to get the car down to L.A., my body guy
down here is absolutely awesome - one of the best in the country, and
certainly the best in L.A., other than Junior's World of Color, for those
familiar.  His name is Lanse Hasselrig.  His shop is full of Ferraris,
Lamborghinis, etc., some of which are being completely restored from
the ground up.  Perhaps others in the L.A. area are familiar with him. 
He'd probably do the whole car for about $4000 (kind of as a favor to
me, since I've been his [unfortunately] very good customer over the last
11 years), and it would probably take 2 to 3 weeks.  Let me know if
you're interested.

San Francisco is a beautiful city but, like any other place, it has its
share of nuts...

Last night some guy, on something, decided to start throwing buckets of
gravel and rocks from the third story of his house some of which landed
on
my car as I was driving by below...

Made a police report, insurance is going to come check things out
probably
tomorrow...

I have chips on the hood, roof, and windshield. I got an estimate for
repainting the whole car... $7,000 if you please... and a month in the
shop...

If I just do the hood and roof will things match to the point where you
can't tell?

Know of any good shops in the Bay Area?

thank you,

&%$#@!!!
