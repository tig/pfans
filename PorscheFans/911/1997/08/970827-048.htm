Denny,

Glad you asked.

Dry air contains 78% pure nitrogen by volume. The rest is oxygen (21%),
carbon dioxide (<1%) and trace amounts of other gases.

Using 100% nitrogen gas basically eliminates oxygen. The heat capacity
of oxygen and nitrogen are  identical (to within 3%). Their
compressibilities are also essentially identical. However oxygen is much
more reactive than nitrogen, Oxygen and water vapor ( compressors tend
to increase the water content of a gas) is even more reactive. The only
advantage I can think of when using nitrogen in tires is - the heat
generated during the friction caused by racing conditions will be much
less effective at breaking down the chemical components  on the inside
of the tire. Water vapor in pure nitrogen gas could react with the tire
compound as well. But without oxygen present it is unlikely these
reactions would be significant. Finally oxygen + heat + certain organic
chemicals can generate extremely reactive molecules called free
radicals. The free radicals act as catylists and the 20% oxygen can
cause more damage than you might think ( or "once the oxygen is all used
up inside the tire no more damage can occur" isn't right).

I wonder what the racing tire engineers would say?
