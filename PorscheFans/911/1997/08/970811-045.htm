I have a 96 Cabriolet with about 15,000 miles. It is a daily driver and 
since I live in So. Cal., the top is frequently down. I've noticed that 
the boot cover is "pounding" a 6-8 inch row of 1/4 inch furrows into the 
paint of the panel in front of the rear spoiler. They are on both sides 
of the panel where the rear of the cover curves forward toward the front 
of the vehicle. I assume the cover is abrading the surface as it is 
buffetted at higher speeds. With the top down, the dings are covered by 
the offending edge of the boot cover; but with the top up and nothing to 
cover them, the dings are very noticeable, at least to me. My dealer's 
mechanic asked the PCNA rep about this and the reply was this was a 
"design flaw" inherent with the cabriolets, and most of the cabs he has 
seen have this. ??? Anyone else have this problem??  Or is the rep just 
bullshi..... me?
