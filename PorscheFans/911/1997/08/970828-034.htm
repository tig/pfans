<<Who drives a Turbo everyday ?

Is the maintenance more on a turbo versus turbo look, true Porsche turbo
look. 

I'm looking to find my next car and am thinking about a late 80's turbo look
or

early 90's C2 turbo look.>>

Denny-
I drive a 930 everyday and would highly recommend it!  I don't leave it in
parking lots (malls, restaurants, etc) without an excellent parking spot (ie.
noone beside me within doors reach), but I would highly recommend a turbo as
a daily driver.  They are more expensive to buy and get worse gas mileage,
but maintenance should be any higher as long as you do it right and at the
specified intervals (or sooner).  The onlything that might be a pain is
having to change the oil more ofthen than in a naturally aspirated 911.  13
qts of oil gets expensive!  The turbos and engines are very strong and rarely
(if ever) fail.  This, of course, is just my experience and opinion (mixed in
with advice from my Porsche technician).  If you can afford it- buy it!  You
only live once.  Plus, it's fun to see all the people "rubberneck" as you go
down the street.
P.S.  I'd be glad to help you find whatever you decide on!
