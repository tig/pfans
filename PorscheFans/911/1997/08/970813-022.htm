> school ready Marseilles Mist SC.  I have had it five years.  All
> mechanicals and body are awesome.  For example, the auto has 98,000
> miles on the chassis.  The engine is stock 3.0 liter size, but was
> extensively prepped by adding:  Twin plug heads, Webers, G-50 trans,
> etc.  The interior has been reupholster in black and grey with two
> custom Recaro seats.  A bolt-in cage has also been installed.  I will
> miss this car - faster than many turbos at 1993 Parade (ran in Modified
> class, but lost to Andy York, who was Parade FTD).  Have decided to keep
> instead my Tubbie, a 75 h.p. '61 coupe I can't bear to part with.
> Would like to give SC free to a good owner, but I am sure you will agree
