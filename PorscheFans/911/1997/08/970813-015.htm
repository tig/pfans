There is a gentleman that I have been dealing with locally that has treated 
me very well. (He also works through the mail.) I have had *very* few problems
with any of the equipment that I have bought from him, and the couple of small
things that came up, he fixed, no questions asked.

He has just about any 911 part that you can ask for, as well a a side business 
repairing/replacing/recovering Targa tops. (He also has a wide variety of 356,
314, 924, and 944 parts.)

His prices seem reasonable and he stands by what he sells. In addition, he is a
walking encyclopedia of Porsche knowledge, and is willing to help talk you 
through a repair.

I gave him a call just for kicks on a door for your car, and he quoted me
about $800, depending on the body type of your car. (Coupe vs. Targa/Cabriolet)

In addition, he has been known to take "trade-ins" if your broken part has 
anything that he can salvage. This will be reflected in your cost.

Anyway, enough promoting (I just like a guy that stands behind what he sells...)

You can contact him at:

        Dan Petchel
        5 Matthew Ct.
        Bordentown, NJ 08505
        (609) 298-7040 

Hope this helps.
