     Hi All,
     
     
        What would you all think an '83 3.0 Complete exhaust system with 
     only 45K miles on it is worth?  Yes, I have such a system which I 
     can't use.  It is part of a complete engine that's going into my 914.  
     They are in beautiful condition, the only flaws are scratches on the 
     bottom of the heat exchangers from the P.O. shoving the ocmplete 
     engine under his workbench.  
     
     
     Items:
     
     2 factory '83 3.0 Heat Exchangers,     scratched on bottom
     1 factory '83 3.0 Catalytic Converter, very clean inside
     1 factory '83 3.0 Muffler              perfect
     
     
     I need to put together an emissions legal(CA)  exhaust system for my 
     '76 914 with this 3.0 engine.  I'm willing to trade for 914/6 parts 
     (oil tank, sheetmetal, custom-exhaust with cats, etc)  I have a rough 
     idea of what the aftermarket wants for new exhaust components for the 
     911 3.0, but not the factory replacement prices...so float me a 
     reasonable offer  I'm flexible.
     
     Other things I need and would be willing to barter for would be:
     
     1) new paint job on car (my exhaust + cash)
     2) 6 & 7 x 16 BBS wheels to fit 914 (or Fuchs)
     3) 901 transaxle rebuild parts
     4) 911 rear hubs & parking brake assembly
     5) 911 into 914 engine mount
     
     thanks
