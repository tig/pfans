<<In my continuing search for the "right" porsche, I noticed that the luxury
car network has quite a selection of used Porsche's. Has anyone had any
experience with this company? Thanks.>>

It's been my experience that they are VERY expensive.  I believe they charge
both the buyer and seller $1,000 for each car.  Very high in my book.  A
favor to ask everyone... whenever anyone posts a message such as this I would
very much appreciate it if you guys could refer the person to me.  As most of
you know I own my own business doing auto locating and brokering, and I
specialize in Porsche and Mercedes-Benz.  Because of my low overhead I am
very reasonable in mny fees and I specialize in very persoanl service.  I
would love to assist anyone on this list in locating the Porsche of their
dreams... I just need some help getting the word out!
Thanks a bunch.
