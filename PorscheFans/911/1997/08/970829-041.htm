Hello PFolk:
 My adjustable Koni's fitted to my SC have mutely raised a question.  Just
what setting is full stiff?
As some of you know, this strain of shocks on the rear can only be adjusted
if you take the darn things off and turn the center rod with an allen
wrench.  The settings are from 0 to 3, with clicks that you can feel as you
turn them.

I always thought that 3 was full stiff, being the end of a full clockwise
turn.  But, the other day I adjusted the fronts to stiff and (click) it
dawned on me that their adjustment to full stiff was counter clockwise...so
should not the rears be the same?

A check of the literature which came with it did not give the answer, not
in any of the three languages. My mechanics, from whom these were
purchased, could not readily answer--told me to call Koni... which I tried
to do but got the automated non-response from them (ITT actually).

So...just what is the full stiff on these?  full counter clockwise to the
"0" setting, or clockwise to 3?
