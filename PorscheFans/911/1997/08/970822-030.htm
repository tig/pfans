        First of all, thanks to all the porsche fans for their valuable
replies to my query questions on my recent purchase.  The 911 is a white
1988 targa with the following options: sport leather seats, climate control
air conditioning, heated seats, spoilers, elevated hub sport steering wheel,
upgraded radio "Reno" model, rear wiper, speed control, and factory alarm.
This baby has only 67,000 km (42,000 mi) and in concours condition.  The
only dislike is it has a burgundy interior but I am getting use to it
already.  The paint finish is absolutely immaculate, not a speck of dirt
anywhere.  The surface rust as mentioned earlier turns out to be the
pitted-kind found only on the clamps and exposed nuts and bolts which were
not galvanized.  The 911 has matching numbers, full service history, and all
factory decals in the engine bay and trunk hood.
        
        The only strange thing about the S/N is that the year component is a
"J" which means to me as a 1989 model (All the porsche books would refer
this as a 1989)...If anyone has a better understanding of the S/N, please
forward me a message.  The wheel/tire combination was correct according to
the owner's manual and the decal in the engine bay (front:195/60VR x 15 and
rear:215/60VR x 15).  After bring it home and detailing the baby, I noticed
that the instrument glass gauges has slight swears inside....does anyone
know how to remove these, it is unnoticeable until the sun hits it at a
certain angle.

        Now after driving the 911 for a few days, I've notice that when the
A/C is operating, the performance of the 911 is slower....is that normal
(Most of my cars aren't like that)?  Also when I turn off the A/C, the
sliders for air distribution is set correctly for fresh air, but to my
amazement warm air circulates through the vents causing discomfort therefore
I must turn on the A/C.  The levers in the tunnel area are down,and the
additional blower is set at "0".  Can anyone comment on this?

        I understand the ownership of a older Porsche will involve some
maintenance, and I believe my purchase is the cleanest and a good value.
I've looked at some 1987 costing $7,000 more and not as clean, and even a
1984 with high mileage, a bad interior valuedat the same price as my
purchase.  Who know's, there are buyers and there are sellers, at least I've
researched enough to be competent in purchasing an immaculate stock,
unaltered 911.  This leaves me a base to alter it to my satisfaction like
different wheels/tires, performance chip......etc.


Thanks again to the porsche fans for their valuable information.


Happy Porsching,

Rick
