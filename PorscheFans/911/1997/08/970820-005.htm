Oh yes up here in Rust Hampshire one definitly needs to to prime and
yes we even use paint after u-coat removal! I would like to add that 
PPG has a line of non sanding epoxy primers with a range of colors:
black,red,grey-green, and white. According to the paint rep, white has
the least corrosion resitant additives. The desire to paint the shop plow
truck was not there,however new 1/4 panels were. I sprayed these with
black epoxy and 4 years of salty winter no signs of the rust worm, with
out any form of TOPCOAT!!!  And the grey-green has a most beautiful
cross between the dark olive drab and the green -yellow that porsche 
sends their new parts in. So most definite, prime and if you want blow 
nice paint where you never see it, topcoat. IMHO epoxy is the ticket
for overall and underall protection, followed with the next thread I see
coming, What U-coat should I Use--------WURTH
 WURTH

WURTH!!!!! Its worth it........sorry it was there, no affiliation
need 800 #s ? write back, i will get them.
