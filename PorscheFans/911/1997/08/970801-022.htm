I have an 87 Carrera Targa with a nasty habit of the DME relay giving =
up. Once was a year ago at a Driver's Ed event ( hot day, got into the =
rev limiter once) where the car acted like there was vapor lock, but it =
got me home. However, at the Driver's Ed event last weekend, it gave up =
completely during the last session. It was another hot day ~80F and I =
did hit the rev limiter once) I was able to get it started thanks to the =
help of the owner of a local repair shop who was there that day (Thanks =
Chris Powell!). And I got most of the way home.

Next day I got another relay, put it in and the car has run fine ever =
since.

Are these things that unreliable? Is there a better replacement other =
than the Bosch part?

I do plan to go get another one and keep it in my glove box, but was =
wondering if there were a better solution.


Thanks -=20
