Bob:

If your oil temperature hits 200 degrees C (that's nearly 400
degrees F), you have serious problems. 

Be that as it may, I wouldn't expect your oil temperature to be 
significantly higher on this trip than on any other... If your engine 
has excess cooling capacity and reaches "200 degrees C" only because 
that's where its thermostat is set, the oil temperature probably 
won't rise much higher than that.

On the other hand... If your engine has NO excess cooling capacity at
"200 degrees C" after a cruise in our more-comfortable climes, your
oil temperature in Las Vegas will probably be higher, by an amount
equal to the difference in ambient temperature between beautiful San
Diego and scorching Las Vegas.  That is, a cooling-capacity-limited
180-degree oil temperature in 75-degree San Diego will translate to a
205-degree oil temperature in 100-degree Las Vegas.
