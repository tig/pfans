>        I am in the US for another month, and would like to buy a radar
detector to use it IN FRANCE. So does anybody knows about one that works
best in Europe, and particularly in FRANCE.

I would have replied privately but who knows, this might save someone
else's butt too. Radars in France theoretically do not operate on the
same frequency, or whatever the appropriate term is. At least that's
what the French police has been claiming for years. I went there with my
escort passport, intending to give it to a friend. We used it, and the X
band was detected all right, but not much on the K or KA, occasional
blips, no more. The fact is there a lot less Radars and cops than in the
States, so I could not find any conclusive evidence. 

Now, danger zone, when there are radars, there are radar detectors
detectors !  And they are quite serious about it. Unlike california
where this is legal, having a detector in France is highly illegal, and
if they catch you with one or even just get a signal on their detector's
detector (assuming you throw it out the window), they will fine you in
the vicinity of $1000 extra, confiscate your detector (ouch, your $400
valentine), add your speeding fine and will impound you car !!  I kid
you not, this happened last year to a friend of mine coming from Spain
in the south of France. You feel stupid when this happens ! 

Bottom line, don't bother, the risks are real (not just folklore), and
it ain't worth it, as if you're a local (as your name indicates), you
KNOW where the radar traps are and there are only a few mobile radars
hidden in cars. Also, slow down about 3 miles before toll booths
(peages) because that's where they'll stop you (they're not into OJ
simpson high speed chases, cop cars are too slow in France!)

Hope this saves you $$$.
