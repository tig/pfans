Howdy,

I'm selling my Trailex trailer.
It's aluminum, dual axle, surge brakes on one axle,
full aluminum floor. I've had it about 10 years with no
problems (was a few years old when I got it I think).
It's not real pretty (although the alum is great of course)
and is best for someone handy in repairs/maintenance.
Trailer parts are available cheap by mail order from Northern 
Hydraulics : i.e. axles, brake tongue, springs, etc.
Or it can be used just fine as-is for day trips.

It's very light and allows towing a sports car 
with a 150 HP tow vehicle at 70+ MPH.
The trailer is wide enough to fit a 993 turbo (just barely)
but probably not very good for ESP/CP cars.

For $1500 FIRM for a $4500 trailex you can't go wrong
even if you want to replace some parts. 

Located in CT, may be able to deliver within reason.
Reason for selling it : I got a great deal on a nearly new Trailex
just like it!
