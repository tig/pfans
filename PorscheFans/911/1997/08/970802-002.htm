This sounds familiar, I remember from a post several years ago when I was asking about replacing the shocks on my 1972 911, that someone talked about torsion bar cars.  They indicated that
with torsion bars it is difficult if not impossible to test the shocks
using the old push on the bumper and count the number of times
the car bounces.  I replaced my shocks for performance reasons,
and mileage (94K) , the fronts I am sure where never changed, and the rears had KYB's.  

By putting Koni's on all four corners, the improvement in ride and handling was noticed, so I know that the shocks where old and worn, but typically, OEM shocks loose their original ride characteristics after 25-30K miles.  A friend has Tokico gas adjustable shocks on his Honda that he Autox's, and has over 100K miles on the shocks, and feels that the shocks perform just as well now, as they did new.

Mike,

I recently replaced my stock Boges ('85 Carrera).  I put in Koni
Sports to be more competitive in autocross.  The old shocks didn't
exhibit any of the normal "old shock" bouncing, and in fact the 
car's ride seemed OK.  It was a bit of a handful in competition, 
and I had a bit of bump-steer feedback on the highway.
