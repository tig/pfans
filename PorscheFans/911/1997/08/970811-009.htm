I have purchased an '83 911 SC coupe that had a small, localized fire in
the front compartment.  As a result, most of the air ducting to the
interior was damaged.  The component that caught fire was the AC
component underneath the "trap door" in the front compartment.  This
piece requires replacement along with almost all of the plastic
ducting.  I discovered that there is a narrow copper tube that connects
the AC switch in the console to the AC unit.  The copper tube is wrapped
in a white insulation.  When replacing AC unit, how do I successfully
connect this tube.  It appears to be attached to both the switch and the
AC component.

Here's the good news - very little wiring was burned in the fire and the
ducting is a simple replacement task.

I would appreciate any help you could offer as I need to get this repair
completed as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Andy.
