Alex Gilmour's is the second query I've read about Performance Aire,
so I might as well share what I know.

I had a PA unit installed in my '75, the dreaded 2.7, two years ago.
It's the first time in the car's life the freon hasn't needed
recharging in more than 2 years.

I took advantage of the occasion to take my little one to Disneyland
to have my a/c worked on, and ended up with an entire unit.  The shop
is in Anaheim, which is a long way from Phoenix, but I'm sure there
are plenty of qualified people there.

The PA unit is really nice, and everything works.  The dash part has a
high-quality, factory look--it looks like the older Behr factory air,
except that the dash bottom and the row of vents are integral, with a
crevice in between.  Same control knobs, same overall look.  It's just
that your dash bottom (including ashtray) will be black, with
compatible grain.

The under-car condenser is very sturdy, and my car is lowered.  I'd
also recommend the towing-hook skids that Tweeks sells (it's been out
of the catalog for a while, but last I checked they still sold them),
but that's where your car will hit first, not the condenser.  Thus
far, I don't think I've ever scraped, much less damaged it.

All told, the unit works perfectly.  Also, Scott (the shop owner) did
an engine fan upgrade, and the car runs cooler than it ever did, both
inside and under the hood.  Bruce Anderson was the one who steered me
to PA, and I ended up thanking him for it.
