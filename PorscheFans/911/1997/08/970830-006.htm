Hi,

I'm a newbie to this list but I'm considering purchasing a 85' 911 coupe
very soon.  The mechanics have all checked out, but I'm not sure if I
should be worried about some minor body rust (actually a couple of small
~1/2 in. dia. bubbles).  It doesn't bother me as much as my wife <grin>.

Is this to be expected in this vintage car in the Northeast US? 

Thanks for any insight.

You did not state if the car had been repainted.  If so, was it due to
collision damage.  Rust bubbles under the paint are a come from two
sources:  1) panel perfroration (rust is comming through from the back),
or; 2) improper surface prep during a paint job.  In either case, you are
likely to see more rust appear over time.  A rusty Porsche is not worth
much.  The sort of rust you  are describing does not sound minor, since
more is on the way.  I would pass on the car unless you can convince
yourself that the spots are isolated and not are early symptom of a rust
bloom all over the car.  It they are isolated spots, I would get them
treated and recoated soon.  Corrosion under the paint film tends to spread
rapidly.

Good luck
