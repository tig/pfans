I would not purchase a 911 without a leakdown test. If they don't know what
it is or say it is not necessary, go elsewhere. Did you get the checklist
from the FAQ? If not, use it to spot the dealer on what to check.

With that much mileage almost everything could be wrong or everything may
be new and the car is a restored gem! Did the PO do valve adjustments, if
so, the reciepts will show gasket and fastener kits, etc..

>3) Any comments on this year 911 that I should know about.

This year was pre-AC improvements and the G50 transmission. As such, you
should be aware of these potential disappointments. Do you like driving it?
It should be a pleasure and give you a rush. If not, something is wrong
with either you or the car ;-)

Did you look around and drive other 911's? The first one I drove (an '85!)
left me with the question "Is that all there is?" based on ownership of two
914's in my younger years. It wasn't until I drove a few others that were
in excellent condition, the '85 had serious engine and suspension problems,
that I understood the mystique of these cars.

Take your time--the wait will be worth it when you get the right one.
