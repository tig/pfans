Dear Fans,

Back from my two day 1000 mile trip from Gaeta (South of Rome) to Venice 
and back.  Tried to avoid Autostrada, but took some sections where I had 
to...and made good time both ways!  7 hours door to door up and 8 hours 
back-  I guess you can work out the average speed, but it seemed pretty 
usefully swift.

The 1976 912E #9912600046 (70K miles) seemed to exhibit all the normal 
2.0 4-pot characteristics...like ran too warm, didn't have huge amounts 
of grunt or staggering top speed, but...IT WENT VERY WELL ON SOME 
SERIOUSLY FAST TWISTY ROADS and even better-  it never came unstuck!!

Believe me, the Italians are serious about fast driving, but for some 
strange reason (I can't work out) they all slow down on severe corners 
in the hills---  YOU WILL burn them up!!  Used very little fuel 
(comparatively), used a bit of oil (about half a litre) but scrubbed 
some P-7 rubber when screaming along (downhill!) and needing to stop IN 
NO TIME.  Oops.

The big deal here is that people respect good driving and beautifully 
shaped (if not the speediest) cars!!  They move over for you 
facilitating a good run on even pretty narrow Superstrada and B-roads.  
Unfortunately, they are also sometimes totally unpredictable-  so mega 
caution and real situational awareness is vital-  since roadside 
recovery and ambulance may not be readily available!!!

I've got a stock 2.0 with 16" Fuchs wheels and was totally impressed by 
the high average speeds attainable, even without the power available to 
sixers.  The problem in the 912E is that you can't stretch the power 
very far, and you have to be satisfied to be ripped past by humble 
Renault Clio's on the Autostrada (doing 120mph thank you!!)

I keep it down to 80-95 mph on the Autostrada, and try to safely 
maintain similar performance where realistic through Umbria and Tuscany.  
The Veneto is relatively flat, so you don't get much g-force fun North 
of Bologna.  You come to categorize tunnels as 80-90-or 100 mph 
tunnels!!  You have to travel North from Genoa to Milano to get better 
nastier twisty bits.

Said hello to Sienna and Padova for you all.  Relished the reaction we 
got considering our car is very well kept but quite old.

Must fix the oil pressure thing and get a HD oil pump to ensure we don't 
burn up in inner space!!  Let me know if you want info on fast car 
travel in Europe, and remember YOU are responsible for your own 
actions!!  Me, I don't mind tootling once in a while (you can't help it 
in a 4-cyl), but every now and again I want to find out what it could 
possibly have been that convinced Porsche enginers that a 912E could 
have a Zuffenhausen badge.  Apparently it's for overall competence 
rather than distinct excellence-  you just find it very hard to drive it 
fast enough for it to fall off.

FAMOUS LAST WORDS!!

I'll keep you posted.
