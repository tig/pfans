My name is James Todd I've recently joined the Mailing list, I don't own a
Porsche yet but I am Looking to buy a 912.

Does any one Know of a good source of information about this model?
Specifically :
>This group is about as good a source as any.  Lots of personal experiences to
hear from.

Specification changes throughout the years.

Years of manufacture.
>65-69 and then one year of 912E in 76.

Change of body styles.
>side reflectors are only on 68's and long body incorporated in 69.  76 has
post 74 bumpers which are of the solid rubber type.

Engine sizes.
>my 68 has a 1600cc with dual solexes
Additionally, I do not know the reason you are seeking specifically a 912,
however, if price is the issue, you need to be aware that parts are getting
incredibly difficult to find for the 65-69 912s.  I know cuz I am constantly
looking for parts for the 68.  an example of this are tail lights.  One tail
light will generally cost around $500, because they aren't made any more and
suppplies are getting low.  Despite this, the 912 handles much like a 911,
some say better because of its lighter weight and better front/rear balance. 
I'd say our 68  912 handles pretty much the same as our 80 911SC.  Certainly
the 911 has more power.  Don't mistake me here, the 912 has enough power to
get you into your share of speeding tickets, but it is less than a 911.  Our
912 gets about the same mileage as the 911 does, although , we drive the 912 a
bit harder due to its less power, we attempt to make up for it with rpms.  
In the early years, there were a LOT of 912s made, and I personally have 4
friends that all own 68s, and love them.  Ours is a four speed, whereas, the
other ones I know of are all five speeds.
I would be happy to answer any other questions that you have, email me
directly at:

Good luck
