I have an 85 911 and a 72 911 with an 87 3.2 (complete with 
Motronic). When I was doing the 72 conversion, I bought a new fuel 
pump to use in the conversion. I think that it is the same fuel pump 
that is used on the 944. Anyway, it was not a Bosch pump. I installed 
it and finally got the electrics figued out and got the car to run (I 
fried a couple of DME's in the process). It would cut out over 3000 
rpm. I tried all sorts of cures and it was driving me crazy. A local 
mechanic asked me where I bought the fuel pump. When I told him, he 
replied that those pumps have a small screen filter on the inlet that 
becomes clogged. The screen is not needed as the large fuel filter in 
the engine compartment does the real filtering. I removed the clogged 
screen and the car has run fine ever since. Just my experieince. Good 
Luck.
