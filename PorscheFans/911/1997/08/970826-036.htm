David,

	>I need to upgrade my brakes on my 81' 911SC for driver 
	education . . . Would it be worth while to upgrade to Carrera 
	calipers, rotors, Carbon Kevlar pads, new lines and Cool brake 
	ducts?  

Cool brake ducts, sure.  Carbon Kevlar pads, sure.  I've had good luck
with Pagids and OK luck with Porterfields.  New lines, not sure.  Not
a bad idea, and not too expensive.  Carrera calipers and rotors?  YES!!!
That was a YES!!!

After years of horsing around with the brake system on my coupe,
the one change that really made a difference, and allowed me to
both have good stopping power AND practice for an entire session,
was changing to Carrera brakes.  It's true that some of the local
Northern California tracks are notoriously hard on brakes, so
what's needed here might not be needed elsewhere.  You'll need to 
shim the rears with a thin washer to get it centered more or less on 
the rotor.
