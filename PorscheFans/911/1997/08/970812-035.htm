Hi, all,

I have an opportunity (?) to pick up a 1994 turbo-look C4 at what SEEMS
like a screaming deal. I'm looking for comments!

The car was an insurance recovery. It's just been purchased by a wholesaler
and I'm in touch with him. It's a U.S. car, about 30,000 miles, white
with black leather interior. No other options known (yet).

The problem is that the thief apparantly stole the car to strip it for
parts. He got as far as cutting off the front fenders and the car was then
recovered. I am told that ONLY the front fenders are affected and the rest
of the car is perfect. This would obviously have to be verified by a shop
before I'd put any money on the car...

.... but I thought I'd pass it by the list first.

The asking price for the car is $29,500 U.S. I'm in Vancouver Canada, so
it'd take a bit of work, etc, getting it across the border. I figure
it'd be in the high $40's in Canadian dollars in as-is condition.

Some questions...

- Does this sound like a good deal? The title, etc, is clear and legit.
- What would one of these in normal great condition probably sell for?
- Were there any changes in the all-wheel-drive mechanism between 1990
  and 1994? I'm still unsure whether I *want* a C4 over a C2. Normally I
  think I'd prefer the C2.

Anything else anyone can add? Cost of replacing fenders with factory parts?

Thanks a bunch!!!

Cheers,

Ross
