Hi,

I recently looked at a 911 for another Porschefan, and while talking to
the mechanic who had the car, we started talking about my car. 

I recently had it "tuned up" and my mechanic said that the dwell was way
off (about 10 degrees) which was causing poor performance and slow
starting. It ran fine for about 500 miles, but now the car seems to be
exhibiting the same problems. I told the above to the mechanic where I
was checking out a car, and he looked at my "bastard" '73 911S with
carbs and wanted to know about the vacuum advance. I don't have it set
up, but when he hooked a tube to the distributor and sucked on the tube,
we could see the points or whatever moving. So he thinks my car needs
the v. advance.

So my question is: Do 911s with carb conversions need to have the vacuum
advance hooked up, and if so where does it hook up to the weber carbs?

Also, if I borrow someone's timing light, how would I check the dwell
and timing? 

Thanks for the help.
