I have the silver gauges on my boxster... its a option that comes w/ the Sports
Touring Package... at first I wasn't sure I liked it... and was considering a
set of the standard black ones to fall back on... but as soon as I started
driving my little badboy... they grew on me... they are a lot more interesting
I think than black gauges w/ white cuz they are a bit more intricate... A) in
the daylight they are silver w/ black lettering but when the sun comes down and
my interior lights fire up theres that orange glow from those funky digits...
its really religious.. B) the silver would seem to be lost at night... but its
not.. the glow from the lit letters lights it gently which gives it a really
funky look... 

I think they look awesome...
are the worth the 600bux they would have costed alone? I don't know... are they
worth it as part of a package DEFINITELY... if I had to buy them alone tho...
after driving w/ them I would definitely do so... 600bux is the right price for
them... they are worth...

unfortunately for the 993 they cost a G!... 1GRAND! hmmm they will make you
happy I believe...
are they worth the grand tho... I don't Know.
