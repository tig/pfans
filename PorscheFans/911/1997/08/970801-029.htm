Sorry if this is a repeat for some folks.  I got a message back that =
this couldn't be sent, and it hasn't turned up on the digest:

Colin O'Keefe was looking for sources of the rubber plugs on the H5 =
headlight trim rings, as well as the rubber seal under the ring.

Colin, I have a 1979, but a PO installed 1987+ fenders, so I know what =
you need.  First, yes the rubber seal should be a single piece.  Problem =
is the two ends are supposed to butt together, where they are held with =
glue to form the circular seal.  I'm not impressed with the strength of =
the glue.  I tried to glue mine back together, without luck.

I bought new ones from Stoddard's.  You have to be careful putting them =
on because you have to stretch them, and I tore one once.  Put the joint =
at the bottom, and carefully stretch the seal onto the fender from the =
top, putting as little force on the glued joint as you can.  It helps to =
have another pair of hands around to hold the seal as you stretch it on.

You can also get the plugs from Stoddard's.  For some reason, they =
didn't have the screw on the bottom of the trim ring on their fiche when =
I ordered a replacement a few years ago.  What they sent didn't quite =
thread properly, but it's working OK.

BTW, you can get these parts from sources like Performance Products and =
Automotion, but for these tiny inexpensive parts their shipping charges =
end up being way more than the cost of the parts.  Places like =
Stoddard's typically charge you actual UPS shipping costs.

Hope this helps!
