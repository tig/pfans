OK, I know that 911s are known for a lot of good things that's why I
searched so long to find one (now I've had it about 3 months).  But they are
also know for Air Conditioning which is essentially an afterthought and
works almost not at all. 

I finally got around to having the AC freon topped up just before a 750 mile
trip.  Thinking that would make some difference I'd waited to complain until
after I'd topped it.  Well even at it's best the 911s AC is living down to
it's reputation.  I found driving through Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania on
sunny days that the only way to get the temp reasonable was to have the unit
on full cool and full fan which drowns out the sound of the motor (one
reason to own the car).  

The car has a black interior; will window tinting make a noticeable
difference or should I just give up and put my attentions to finding the
wheels I'll need??  (Window tinting will be cheaper than wheels!)

Thanks.
