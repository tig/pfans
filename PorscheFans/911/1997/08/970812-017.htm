Andy, Re: the copper pipe that you want to reconnect to the switch and
to the Evaporator. This is the temp. sensor from the Thermostat the
control in the console that determines the temp. of the a/c coil. It is
filled with R-12 and sealed and must be handled with great care. You
will have to replace it but do not bend the new one or kink the tube,
make soft bends in the tube. If it cracks it will not function at all.
That tube goes from the switch and sticks into the coil about 4-5 inches
and needs a tight connection to the fins in order to sense the temp.

John, you did all the right stuff to check you cars a/c charge and the
level of freon half way up the sight glass is very close to being full.
It will work very well at this level. This is just there to tell you or
the tech. that freon is in liquid form at that level. Be sure to ck. to
see that the front cond. fan is working.

Roger
