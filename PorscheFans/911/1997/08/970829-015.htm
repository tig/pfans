Doug,

     The shifter on my '79 930 was the same way, long, whippy and imprecise. 
I hated it after so many years of other cars with short, precise shifters. I 
bought a short shift kit (not Weltmeister) and sent it right back because of 
what appeared to be crappy quality. So this is what I did.

     WARNING: PURISTS DO NOT READ FURTHER

     I cut abut two inches off the end of the shift lever. If you use a 
small pipe cutter you can make a quick, clean cut without removing the shift 
lever. The result is a much more solid and positive  feel with shorter 
throws. Shift effort is slightly higher as you would expect but not by much. 
 With the seat back far enough for my 6'3" frame, reach to the shifter is 
also not a problem. For me, it was a major improvement and makes the car 
much more enjoyable to drive.

     I suppose this changes the dynamics of the forces acting on the tranny, 
but since my car has a Ruf 5 speed that I don't want to damage, I don't slam 
shift it anyway.
