Wow, Bob.  

It's really hard for me to think of a '86 911 Turbo as an "earlier car" !
However, I have to agree with your comments about the skill it takes to
drive a 911 well.

I came to Porsches via the Lotus "Elan Plus 2S".  Man what a difference ...
with the Elan, all you had to do was make a general sort of wish as to what
you wanted the car to do.  Then, it would do it: flawlessly, immediately.
It had 1970 technology, no power steering, no nothing other than an
extremely well thought out intrinsic toplology.

Don;t get me wrong: I've had my 911 for 7 years, and it is much nicer than
the Plus 2S in terms of creature comfort.  I also have to admit to liking
the 911's raw power; but someday, I hope to be able to drive it as
effortlessly and as well as my old Lotus.
