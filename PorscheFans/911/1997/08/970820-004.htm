My two cents.

On my 911 that I recently replaced the gas tank and repaired some surface
rust on the inside and under the car, I used an angle grinder with a knotted
steel wire brush to remove the loose undercoat inside and out.  The brush
also knocked off the top of the rust, but left the metal rough.  I then
painted POR 15 over the exposed metal and left over rust (the POR15 is
supposed to be painted over rust or rough metal).  When the POR is tacky,
then I sprayed a urethane primer on the painted areas.  If you don't spray
the primer while the POR is tacky, it will gloss over and nothing will stick
to it without sanding.

After the primer dried, they I could spray new undercoat on the exposed
area's.

I highly recommend the POR to anyone who has an un-galvanized car, especially
to spray up into the front tank support area to keep it from rusting anymore
than it already has.

I've got examples on my site: http://members.aol.com/jhelgesen/johnpage.html
or for aol people:  <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/jhelgesen/johnpage.html">J
