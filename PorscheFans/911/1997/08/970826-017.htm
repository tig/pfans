    Greg:

    It occasionally snows in Germany, too...

    The 911, like the VW Bug and most other rear-engine
    rear-wheel-drive cars, does REAL well in the snow... Remember
    VW's "What does the snowplow operator drive to work?" ad?

    If you put snow tires on it every winter and don't lower it
    excessively or put a ground-scraping airdam on it, it should
    perform almost as well as those little 4WD Subarus.

    If you need tire chains, by the way, your local Porsche dealer
    will sell you a set specifically made for your car... Unlike
    most, the Porsche chains won't interfere with your fenders.

> will the heater keep me warmer than my dad's old VW Bus

    Yes, the heater will probably keep you toasty warm, although the
    car's air-conditioning (if installed) is likely to disappoint
    you come summertime.

> am I crazy?

    Maybe, but not just because you want to drive a 911 in the snow.
