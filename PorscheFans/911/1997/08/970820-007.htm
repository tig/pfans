The car has a black interior; will window tinting make a noticeable
difference or should I just give up and put my attentions to finding the
wheels I'll need??  (Window tinting will be cheaper than wheels!)

Bruce-
Having just been through this myself, thought I'd chime in.  Couple of
things:
1. 911 AC sucks.
2. Spend lots of money on it and it still sucks.

However, it does get better.  I've done a few things to make it as good as
possible and it's now tolerable on hot days, but still nowhere near GM cars
-- crappy cars, best AC in the world.  BTW, I live in Atlanta.

Minor improvements:
1. Rotary compressor - improves the efficiency of the system slightly.
($$$)
2. Top up freon - air gets cooler, not cold! ($$)
3. Window tint ($)
4. Sunshade - for the parking lot at work (1/2$)

Major improvement:
Remove the "splitter" underneath the dash.  (FREE!)  This is a little bent
piece of metal bolted to the AC ducts just above the center console.  You
won't believe the increase in airflow.  If you like, you can install the
vents from Automotion, but I've just left mine open.  I've now got AC I can
live with on 95 degree, 95% humidity days.
