Jim:

        I purchased a 1987 Targa three months ago with a very stiff clutch.
The guy I paid $100 to for inspection said the car was fine. The car need a
new clutch and there is also a service bulletin that needs to be performed
relating to the throwout bearing and a shaft that is involved and the whole
thing can cost 1500-1700. If you can find a mechanic who will let you buy
your own parts buy the bulletin kit and clutch from a company in Miami
called Vertex at 305-442-2727. The clutch cost me $476 and I don't remember
the cost of the bulletin kit. The engine and tranny have to come out of the
car and it is about an 8-10 hour job. Hope this helps. Sorry for the bad
news. Maybe you won't need it but don't let anybody tell you it is an
adjustment because this is an hydraulic clutch and there is only a tiny bit
of play that can be adjusted in the pedal.
