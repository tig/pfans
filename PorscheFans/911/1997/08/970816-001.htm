Thanks a lot, You have all been very helpful.

Just 1473 built? is that a small number for Porsche? 

I have now a few question more, they pop up as I begin to study the car.

1.
I have been buying 98 octan unleaded gasoline, is that what I should be
running on? can I use 95 octan unleaded or ...?

2.
What size of tires should I have. Currently I have 205/60-15 (front) and
225/60-15 (rear, 9" wide wheels)  is that the original sizes?

3.
Also, did anyone have a solution to glen's oil-level problem(digest
08/14/97).  I noticed that I am having similiar problem.  Eventually the oil
level goes up(to the top) but isn't it supposed to do that
immediately?(might be loose wiring)  The oil pressure is ok(6-8 kg) so I am
not desperate, or should I be?.  

4. 
Any tips on buying exhaust system

Again, thanks a lot.

Best Regards
Runar
