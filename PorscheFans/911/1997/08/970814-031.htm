Hello ProscheFans,
This is not exactly a Porsche question so please forgive me.
I am taking a holiday in the Florida region and would like to ask the
following questions.
When I visited the USA a few years ago and hired a car I took out insurance
that was called CDW (crash damage waver, I think). A friend has just
returned from Florida and he paid for LDW (is this the same as CDW) and SLI
(what ?????.) and FL SRCHG & FEE (2.05 per day). What are all these charges
and are they just for us 'Brits abroad'or are they compulsory.
Does anybody know of anything Porsche happening mid september in the
Florida area. 
Many thanks for your help.



Nick. (30% restored 1970 911S)
