a) The engine fan blows air through the heat exchangers where it is
heated by the exhaust manifolds. The air then flows through the
diverter/flapper valves into ducting in the car's body where it is
carried to the dash. The diverter valves are connected to the levers
between the seats to control the amount of warm air that is blown into
the car. Note that the air is always flowing through the heat
exchangers, the valves merely divert it either into the car or under the
car.
b) The first thing I would check is that the cable from the lever is
still connected to and operating the diverter valve. The valve is near
the front of the transmission. You will need to get under the car, so it
will have to be up on jack stands or a lift. There will be a hose
connecting the heat exchanger to the valve; this hose is 2-1/2 inches,
about 6 cm., in diameter. Have someone operate both levers while you
observe the valves. If one moves and the other doesn't, then that is the
source of your problem. The other obvious thing to check is the hoses;
there are a pair going from the engine fan housing through the sheet
metal to the rear of the heat exchangers and then the other pair going
to the valves.
c) Probably, but I don't know of a specific procedure. Ingenuity would
probably be called for.

Caveat: I own a later model and the above is based on casual observances
of earlier cars.
