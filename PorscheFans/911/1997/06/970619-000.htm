I had a rock splat fixed in my '88 Coupe's windshield and the repair guy
claimed that German windshields are generally inferior to American. And
that there was an American mfg for 911 windshields, but he couldn't
remember the name. 

While we're on the subject, another question: The antenna wire in my
windsheild is rusted (mostly where it runs across the top). The rust has
spread out through the layers of glass about 1 mm on each side of the
wire. Is this a common thing? Should I worry about it?
