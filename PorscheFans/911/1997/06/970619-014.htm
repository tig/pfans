There is only one problem: there is a loud resonance between 2K and 3K
RPM. It is not just loud, it is nearly painful. Dave Said, the maker of
the Triad muffler, says that this is a characteristic of the '74 header
design that the SSI's use. He went on to say that the stock '74 muffler
was carefully tuned by the factory to cancel the resonance. It was his
contention that all after market mufflers and even the factory sport
muffler fail to damp this resonance.

So, do any of you, my esteemed p-car colleagues, have SSI systems and if
so, do they have this resonance? <<

I don't believe Triad. I have SSIs that I've used with sport mufflers
(modified stock) and supertrapps (which do very little muffling with
all the disks in) and noticed no resonances. I think it's in the
muffler not the headers.

Best bet is to keep it over 3K RPMS! ;-)

P.S. anyone wondering where I've been the last few months :
I was offline replacing or rebuilding everything behind the
driver except the engine (fuel and brake lines, brakes,
axles, bushings, bearings, tranny, clutch, etc etc etc). 
Now I have to pull the engine
AGAIN as the tranny rebuild did not work out. I can't
get it into 2nd gear without nearly breaking off the shifter
and 3rd gear is even worse. Often (like during an autocross
run) it simply won't go in at all. I hit 1st gear 3 times
trying to shift into 3rd at over 60MPH due to to this problem
and my engine survived ~ 10,000 RPMs (caught it quick after 
feeling the rear tires lock up and nearly rolling the car once). 
After 11 years of autocrossing, my 915 tranny (which was rebuilt
in '85) was nearly destroyed inside but I was still able
to shift it fine (until now.) Enough venting...
