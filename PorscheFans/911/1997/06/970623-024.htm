Dear Porschefans,
some sparse notes about my 964 turbo.
The  "great fuel pump nightmare": my front fuel pump started a noisy affair
after a fool short-of-fuel running. With great tact, Bruce Anderson wrote
me to be very careful about that, since a noisy pump can be easily a self
destructing pump. At italian official P-workshop (I firmly stand on them)
current prices, a Bosch f.p. means some 600$. I'd rather prefere spending
that on a 255/40 S-01! Knowing my deep and sad feeling, the pump suddenly
resumed its reassuring buzz, letting me very happy. Bruce, you do persuade
it to not commit suicide!
After that, here in Sardinia the temperature started to rise over the
thirties (C); remembering my old Carrera 3.2 (triple black the old, triple
black the new), I wasn't surprised the A/C produced exactly the same
temperature my open window did, but I was pretty upset that such a piece of
German machinery was overwhelmed by my Fiat Punto A/C (not to mention my
freezing former Maserati Spyder A/C). Porsche A/C is definitely the black
hole of a P-owner pride but never indulge in commonplaces! The lines were
running  ohne druck, and 70$ of freon did the difference from my old
Carrera; my next holiday trip to the Alps will be a cool affair!

I've bought the old Excellence issue (2/91) introducing my 964 turbo; I'm
convinced now that you have to read only contemporary-to-the-introduction
articles about your car, since your state-of-art  car rapidly becomes a
thanks-to-god-they-change-it when the new state-of-art is introduced
(changing eleven bolts and increasing the price). After that, you have to
wait twenty years until the truth will be restored. Fortunately in my huge
books and magazines database I can find everything I need to read to be,
nevertheless, happy with my ex-state-of-art car...

Anyway, boys, drive twenty fast Kms and all those chat-chats are
behind...God bless the K27 and the Brembos!

Aldo
