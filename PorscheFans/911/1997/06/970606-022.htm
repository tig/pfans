Thanks for the replies to my post concerning the installation of SSI heat 
exchangers that I have acquired.  I have decided that I will pass these along 
to someone else. 

Here is the deal.  I have contacted SSI and the exchangers I have are thin 
flange flat toped.  They are off a 79 SC 3.0 but were designed for earlier 
cars.  
They will work with virtually any year with some adjustments in installation.  

With the 3.2 I would have to use washers or an extra flange to build the 
flange height up to work with the 3.2's longer studs.  They are not new but 
they are stainless steel.  $450 plus shipping
