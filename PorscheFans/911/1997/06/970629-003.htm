My $$$$.02 on this, Porsche are expensive to maintain. For the work you
don't want todo your self find a mechanic you like and can trust, go by the
shop and look around do they have all models around or just older ones. Do
they have uptodate tools, are the customers milling around satisfied. Talk
with anyone you can ask the list for recomendations in your area.

Next there are some things you can do it you want. My preference is that I
havea the yearly major service done by my shop. 

5 hours valve adjustment,

This seems a little high
2.8 hours fuel system carbon clean

Not necessary use Redline SI1 fuel injection systment cleaner put in full
bottle to satrt with then use as directed.
 and 4 hours to install front rotors and pads.

Way to much on this, Can be done in two. My
>sense is that this is insane and he has simply jacked the price to make it
>look like he was being a prince and giving me a good discount.

I agree you inflated by a bunch hours on this, Call his bluff ask for the
Mitchells flat rate book and watch his eyes rollllllll back.
