Dear Michael:

See my posts these past few days. I have found the same thing in my '97
Carrera 7500 miles...

Went to the dealer in a panic, the mechanic (there's only one Porsche
guy at this dealership) was happy to pull the dipstick on two other
993's (one with 1800 mi & one with 5800 mi) both had the same thing to
the mechanic's suprise!

It seems that these "bits" are coming from the dipstick-yes the
dipstick. Look at what the dipstick is made out of-some kind of flakey,
compressed metal. If the bits were coming from the engine, they would
settle in the bottom of the oil pan, not on the dipstick. I am having
the oil ( & filters) changed at 8 am tom'w. I will try to get a 4 oz
sample of the oil to be sent for analyzation (anyone know how much?). If
there's something wrong, then it seems POrsche might have a larger
problem on their hands, which might be bad for us as well (too
widespread of a problem, they might not want to fix it)-but lets
see...................

Any input greatly appreciated.....Bruce you out there???
