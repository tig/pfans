Question was:

I have a 1997 993 Turbo and as you probably already know the
tires are Pirelli PZero's the manual recommends the following tire
pressures

225/40ZR18 front    36 psi
285/30ZR18 rear     44 psi

My question is what tire pressure should I use on the track???
Please don't tell me I should use R1's instead I know that, but until
I have the R1's what is the best pressure on the track for my street
tires??

My experience on the track with , 993 Turbo and 993 C4S and Pirelli
PZero, is to run them at F32 and R40 (cold). They will quickly reach the
factory recommended pressure, which is where you want them to be. You
can further expect them to wear out quickly [one wkend=one set rear
tires] At about $750 per set I found it better to put on 17"wheels and
use R1s. BF Goodrich will have 18" by March/April 98 they said at Parade
last week.
