(This is my second attempt at mailing this message today...)

Fellow PFans,

I recall recently reading a thread where people discussed the pros and cons
of speeding during the Superbowl...

Well this week I have been able to enjoy the benefits of such an experience.
 I live in Chicago and of course the Bulls are in the NBA playoffs - Well I
don't know anyone here who is not a Bulls fan.  Me of course,  I am from out
of town/country so can tolerate missing the odd game or three.... 

So - Sunday night the phenomenon first occurs - I find myself driving between
my girlfriend's house and mine - usually takes 15-20 minutes - took 5 minutes
- no traffic let alone Police cars.  I guess cops like basketball too.

Last night on my way home from work - 10 minutes before the game starts -
usually takes 1 hour - Did it in 25 minutes - Man it was nice to clear the
cobwebs outta my 944,  I forgot how well it held the road at 100MPH plus...
  

Now the dilemma - If the Bulls don't make it to the playoffs next year - I
will have to relocate...    Any ideas on what teams might be in the playoffs
next year?  I could handle a short stint in NY or maybe even Boston?

How about the Superbowl???  Anyone know who's making the next Super Bowl?

<Sorry about the band-width but I had to share this with someone...>
