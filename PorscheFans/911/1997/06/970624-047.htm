Nill,
I think you will find that a Targa top is "more secure" than a cab's,
but then everything's relative.  This was a major consideration for
me, and I find it a great compromise.  The Targa top has metal
reinforcement inside, making it very rigid.  It also clamps on
tightly.  For a nice picture by Harley Myler of what's inside the
targa top, go to the  Poor Man's Porsche site:

Can't comment on rain, because I've never tried driving in it.
Is it true that cab's aren't allowed at driver's ed?
