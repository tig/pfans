- '89 Carrera coupe, 50,000km (30,000 miles), has had *light* damage
  to one front fender (I'm assuming suspension was not damaged), 
  assuming damage was *properly* repaired.
- '87 Carrera coupe, VERY low mileage (don't know for sure, I assume 
  lower than the '89), has sat for 2 years.

Ross:
C'mon, you know the only thing that really counts is color! 

Seals on a super low mileage car was something I was warned about more 
than once. Tim also mentioned it. Will they warranty this car?
Don't forget clutch replacement. Mine was done at 62k. If this is a 
daily driver as well as fun, you'll put 12k on it fast.
It also comes down to $$$$$, and service records. Super low mileage is 
only great if the car was driven and maintained properly. I saw a couple 
of BAAAAD low mileage cars and GOOOOD higher mileage cars when I was 
looking.

If all jives, buy the '89 and I'll see you at the Show and Shine in a 
couple of weeks.

Oh yeah, in case you were wondering... they're both galvanized!(-:

Good luck. Give my best to Tim and Paul.
