Hi...don't know your name because it wasn't posted.

I know how you feel regarding the clutch job.  Every mechanic expects the
customer to be happy by spending as much money as possible.  However, there
is such a phenomenon in today's business economy called competition.  I can
understand that the mechanics aren't working out of their home garage and
have overhead to take care of.  I think they could at least be reasonable
in their pricing, because there shouldn't be such a large disparity ($320 +
just for a clutch???).  If he was smart, he would have made the difference
up on the labor, and met the ball-park price of the clutch...oh well, some
are just mechanics, and some are mechanics and business people.

I know it doesn't feel good to have a guy working on your car who is pissed
off, it kinda makes you think, 'what is he going to do to my car?' ... I
don't think you should have anything to worry about.  It's your right as a
consumer to purchase where you want to, however we must all respect the
mechanics living as well.

Joe
