Dave--
I bought the car because the engine had just had a complete rebuild at
the hands of one of Denver's best wrenches, knowing that the body needed
a lot of work. Of course, the first thing I had to do was invest another
4 grand getting a three cent piece of plastic removed from the oil pump
(somebody stuck the piece in the oil return tube to keep it from leaking
on the garage floor while doing some work, and neglected to remove it
when reassembling). Then came the body work: Replaced the floor pan and
front suspension pan; re-did  both back fenders. The PO had added SC
flares which had been tack-welded every two or three inches, not a very
good, or secure, system; replaced the PO's whaletail with a standard
engine deck lid (traded even with a guy in California); replaced inner
and outer rocker panels on both sides; took the old paint to bare metal,
and repainted; replaced all seals--windows, doors, windshield, fenders,
etc.; re-did the interior, carpets, dash, doors panels, headliner,
sunvisors, rear qwuarter panels, and rear window sill (got a nice piece
for this with two cutouts for 6" speakers from a guy in Oregon who I can
recommend highly); and, finally, added black sheepskins for the seats. 

Total cost right at $10,000, plus the original $3,500 for the car, plus
the $4,000 of unanticipated engine work. For insurance purposes, it
appraised at exactly that--$17,500, so I'm even, at least on paper. I
know that I could have bought a much newer car for that amount, but I
also know that I have a car that is in showroom condition, and that
needs no further work, something that I would not be sure of had I
bought, say, a 1985 SC for that amount. Besides, it was a lot of fun to
be involved in the process of finding and buying parts. I might even do
it again, much wisened, on a 356 if I find the right car. And, I might
do a lot more of the work myself next time.
