I've found a car that I like, but there's always something, isn't there...
This car is an '87 Targa in nice condition.  The thing that concerns me
about it is the guy has just put 17" Borbet C2 replica wheels on it.  (They
look just like '92 5-spoke C2 wheels.)  They are 17x7.5 front, 17x9 rear.
It's got brand new Dunlop SP8000's, 205/50-ZR17 front, 255/40-ZR17 rear.  

He says this wheel/tire combination was recommended to him by Robert Wood
of Wheel Enhancement, though he ended up buying them from NTW here in
Atlanta.  He said Wood specifically recommended these replicas instead of
OEM Porsche wheels to avoid the need for spacers, etc.  He paid $240 apiece
for the wheels (and sold the original 16" Fuchs for $50 apiece!).

Anyway, to get to the point, are these wheels and tires going to be OK in
this application?  He did not roll the fenders.  Fit?  Quality of Borbet
wheels?  Other comments?  They do look good...
