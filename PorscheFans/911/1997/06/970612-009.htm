-----------------------------------------------------------
I've spent a fair amount of time putting together brake bleeder kits for
BMW's and the same reservoir cap for these kits fit all Euro ATE reservoirs
(Porsche, MB, Volvo, Saab, VW, Audi and BMW).  Kits start with a quality
reservoir cap adapter ...some of the cheaper caps are made in Eastern Europe
and tapped to metric thread pitch, not 1/4" NPT  (good luck finding the
proper air supply fitting).  Basic cap (aluminum with anodized finish) with
male air inlet plug is around $28.00.  If the customer is using a portable
air tank or other unregulated air supply, the cap is coupled to a very
precise diaphragm type pressure regulator (CoilHose Pneumatics) fitted with
a low pressure spring (0-50psi) and a gauge.  This setup will take up to
300psi input and accurately regulate it to the 18-22psi pressure required
(Do Not Use the cheap air volume pressure regulators....1/4 turn will go
from full closed to full open with very dramatic results! I believe the
reservoir will take as much as 30psi but I don't want to do any testing on
my own 930 with the reservoir full of fluid).  This kit (cap plus regulator
& gauge) is $68.00.  The only drawback to an air pressure bleeder is that
you have to keep an eye on the fluid level in the reservoir, topping it off
after each wheel.  I recommend a pushbutton type disconnect ($10 with the
kit...you can also get these through Imparts for $15.00) which allows one to
easily disconnect the air supply hose from the cap without stressing the
reservoir.                                                        I also
offer the Snap-on type hand pump bleeder (I buy them from the same company
Snap-on uses), replacing their disconnect with the better pushbutton type
mentioned above and include the bleeder cap and fitting.  This system
pressurizes and feeds fresh brake fluid to the reservoir and is popular with
many shops and track junkies.  Complete kit sells for $130.00.  Although a
better system, I still prefer the air pressure bleeder as it's less likely
to make a mess and I don't have to worry about mixing blue and yellow (and
the resulting green) fluids in the one gallon tank.
The only kit I have above this is by Stierius of Germany...this is a 2.5
gallon hermetically sealed tank with a built in electric pump (no air
compressor required), gauge and pressure regulator for shops doing high
volume brake work. This kit comes with the cap adapter and a calibrated
bottle to receive the old fluid.  This is truly the nicest brake bleeder
I've seen but is a bit much for weekend mechanics. Price is $700.00 for this
tool.                                      The above tools/kits are options
to the homemade pressure bleeders, EZ-Bleed, vacuum pumps, check valve
replacement nipples, diaphragm type bleeder tanks and old-fashioned "pumping
the brakes".  Pick the system you're most comfortable with and use it at
least once a year.  SD
