Hello All,

Many of you have had good things to say about the Valentine One.  I bought
a Whistler about a year ago, and I've had to send it back three times now. 
They have fixed it twice before (I just sent it in for the 3rd time
Friday), but I'm not too happy with its problems.

Does anybody have an recommendations on any other detectors?  I may buy a
new one.  It would have to have laser, because these Western New York cops
use it sometimes, and also have VG-2 detection because I drive in Canada at
least once a week. 

I've seen several brands that fit this description for around $ 100.  I can
respect the Valentine One, but it seems a bit pricey.  Maybe it's worth
it...
