Hey,

Just when I thought putting headers on my car was
going to be easy, I've run into snags with my oil lines.

I made some measurements and had decided that
I could make some bends in the line that runs around
the rear of the engine (PN 911.107.741.11) and clear
my mufflers and still use the line that goes from this
line to the thermostat.  Unfortunately I ruined the line
removing it from the car.  :>(  To complicate matters,
the fitting that screws into the engine on the driver's
side (that the above PN'd oil line attaches to) is now
"stuck" in the end of what's left of the oil line.  :>((

I have 2 options, the way I see it.  I can buy another
line that runs around the back of the engine, bend it like
I think I can to make it work and live happily ever after;
or I can install the line that goes under the engine
(PN 911.107.739.10 - which I have) and buy the
additional line (PN 930.107.729.10 - which I am
having a hard time visualizing how this thing interfaces
with the .739. line) and still live happily ever after.

The problem with option 1 is that I'm not sure it will
even work (anyone have one of these oil lines left
over from a header installation that they want to sell -
cheap??).  The problem with option 2 is that after
ruining one oil line, I'm scared to death to try to remove
the oil line that attaches to the thermostat.

BTW, does anyone know the part number of the fitting
that threads into the case on the driver's side right
near the oil pump? - I might need to order one of
these...

What a bad day...

Any help would be appreciated...
