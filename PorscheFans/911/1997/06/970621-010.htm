ADS makes/made a speaker that you could mount on/in the rear deck without
the need for cutting.  They are a 2way square "framed" setup with 4-4.5"
woofer and 1-1.5" tweeter.  

The unit's sound is Excellent, as are all ADS speakers I've heard.

There are other manufacturers who make similar products and should also work
fine.  If you have a "Quality" sound store in your area I would recommend a
visit to them for additional input.  If you're in Illinois there's a pretty
reputable shop in Algonquin which I've used for the last 10-12 years and
have never been disappointed by.

I would recommend staying away from an OBLONG speaker and stick with round.
As far as subwoofers go if you don't mind losing your rear seats (not really
an option for me with kids) your options are certainly increased.  I don't
think it would take much to get some good sound out of your 911 if you're
willing to change the front door speakers to something more up to date than
the garbage Porsche put in there...at least mine are terribly inefficient.

If you already own a head unit and a a couple of 2 channel amps or single 4
channel amplifier with some decent power another $500 dollars should get
some head slamming sound going.
