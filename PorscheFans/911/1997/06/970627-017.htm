I know that if my oil level is to high the same thing happens to my air 
box.  As far as the cruise control my '73 doesn't have it so no ideas.

good luck,

Scott

From: driver8@ibm.net, on 6/27/97 10:02 AM:
I've got a couple of niggling issues with my 78 911 SC with which I
could use some help.

1.  I've got an oil leak that seems to be coming from my airbox. 
Previous Owner installed a nifty stainless steel box on the car after
blowing up a couple of plastic boxes (guess he didn't hear about the
poop-off valve).  Oil vapor (?) appears to be coming from the box,
condensing on the forward part of the engine, running down the block,
dripping on the heat exchanges and making the car smell like it has a
serious problem.  Oil loss is slight; I might have gone through a quart
and a half on a 2,000 mile trip.  Questions:  Does this seem remotely
possible?  Should I consider replacing the stainless box with a factory,
plastic box?  Has anyone heard of these metal boxes developing minute
cracks that would cause the above situation?  Could it be the seal
between the box and the engine?  If so, would a new/better gasket help?

2.  Cruise control.  On said 2000 mile trip, I spent the majority of the
time on our nation's interstate system.  Cruise control worked great,
but there appears to be something wrong with the cable from "cruise
central" to the throttle.  When I shut off cruise to get gas or enter a
town or something, the throttle "hangs" at about 1500-2000 RPM.  I can
open the engine lid and push the cruise cable back into "cruise central"
and the engine will idle normally.  Is there a way to replace the cable
only, or must I get a new cruise servo (that's what it is, isn't it?)? 
Naturally, this is less than a big deal, but it would be nice to pull
into a gas station at normal idle.  Perhaps keep the locals from giving
me the evil eye.  Then again, perhaps not.

I welcome any thoughts on these, admittedly minor, issues.

Sincerly,
Tim Krone
