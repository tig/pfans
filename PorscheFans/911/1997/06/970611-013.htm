>Mark,
>
>I attempted to purchase a steering wheel cover from Alan Gunn Leather
>Accessories (AGLA) about six months ago and it was very, very frustrating.
>My credit card was charged before the product shipped, the wrong product
>shipped originally, a lot of phone calls were never returned, there was no
>response from letters, and repeated promises that the correct product had
>shipped "yesterday" or would ship "today" were broken.  After a couple of
>months of this, I notified my credit card company and started notifying the
>publications that ran the AGLA ads of the situation -- then I finally heard
>from Alan Gunn.  He identified himself as "DR. GUNN" and preceeded to very
>aggressively cuss me out for hurting his reputation.
>
>Patience had prevailed until he decided to cuss me out, so I canceled my
>order and he refunded my money.  I was unsuccessful in locating any other
>vendor for a steering wheel cover so I eventually replaced my order through
>Automotion for another AGLA cover.  When the correct product arrived, I was
>very pleased with the quality.  It fit very well on my 25 year old steering
>wheel in site of obvious heat deformations to the wheel.  There were plenty
>of supplies included (extra thread and needles) and the instructions were OK.
> 
>
>By the way, the cover was easy to install and it only took several hours to
>"sew" the cover onto the wheel -- and I did not lose the use of the car while
>the steering wheel was sent off for someone else to sew it on. 
>
>Overall, it appears to be a very good product.  However, whether you opt for
>the parts or the recovering service, it may be better to go through
>Automotion or someone else with some clout.  Customer service or
>follow-though may not be Mr. Gunn's forte.

>Hey Fans,
>
>Wss wondering if any of you have had your steering wheel recovered by =
>Alan Gunn Leather out of Florida (I think). Have seen their adds in Pano =
>and am contemplating what to do about my wheel. Seemed the PO did =
>nothing to it to preserve it and its shot. Can't decide on replacing =
>with a nice Momo wheel or getting this one recovered. Can anyone shed =
>some light here on pros and cons? Also if anyone has replaced wheel with =
>a Momo can you offer any tips as to model you prefer and why? I'm not =
>planning on autocrossing or any track events. Its just my daily driver =
>that I enjoy to the max and am wanting a nice wheel to set off the =
>interior a bit. TIA
