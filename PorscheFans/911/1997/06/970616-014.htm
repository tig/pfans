First and foremost I would like to thank all the respond e's.
The culprit was, a "u-joint" located under the console "buried under the
console" I'm told.
It's a 66.00 part that requires ~2.0 hours to replace, adjust etc.
Add to that Recharge A/C, Replace a high pressure hose that let the Freon get
away,
and oh yeah why not do the 90K Service while it's here now, TOTAL is now
1625.00 US dollars :^) no wait :^(
God I love this CAR....;^) How can spending that much money not get you real
upset ?
I miss it already and it won't be done until tomorrow.
I gotta get some Psych. help Soooooooon
Again, Thanks for the help.
Denny
