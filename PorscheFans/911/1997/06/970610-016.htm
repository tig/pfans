Many thanks to those who responded to my request.  Being impatient to get
my car back on the twisty roads,
I opted to replace the entire thermostat assembly.  Next time a system
fails, I'll search for sub-assembly
components if available.
Total cost was $260 for parts, plus oil/filter, and 4hrs labor.  (Hey I may
be slow, but I'm meticulous!)
Ya gotta love this list!   ChrisK.

Chris,
  I asked my mechanic the same question today as we looked at the used B&B
oil cooler, porsche hard lines and thermo we will be installing next week,
and he says that over many many years, he has only replaced a half-dozen or
so thermostats, the original porsche ones are usually OK even used, but if
they do go bad, it is easier to replace than to fix.

The secondary oil thermostat in a C2/4 is of a different design than of
the engine thermostat and can indeed fail.  It is very easy to test
either on or off the car.  If your oil temp has gone up from what you
feel it should be, simple put your hand on the shroud in front of the
right front tire and feel for heat coming off of the plastic shroud
(very unscientific) when the engine temp gauges shows excessive heat.
If the shroud is cool to ambient temp, you probably have found your
problem (this is assuming that your fan belt is intact...first thing to
check).

The next step would be to remove the plastic covers on the right side of
the car underneath the door.  Start with the plate in front of the right
rear wheel..there are two plastic nuts (10mm head size) and two sheet
metal screws holding the plate on.  Access is easier with the wheel off
and the right side in the air on jack stands.  With this plate off, the
thermostat regulator is now visible.  With the engine running, check the
two long oil lines that exit the aluminum housing and go to the front of
the car.  They probably will be hot for a few inches away from the
regulator...
but about 8-12 inches away they will be relatively cool.  If this is your
symptom, the termostat is stuck shut.

The thermostat can easily be tested by putting it into a pan of very hot
to boiling water.  Observe the silver piston (for lack of a better word)
and its dimension to the outer stainless steel sleeve.  When it is hot,
the "piston" will extend about 15mm away from the steel sleeve.  It will
be very apparent.  If you get no change, then your t-stat is definitely
bad.

I just replaced one on a customers 1991 C4.  The parts were $95.00 for
the t-stat and $3.20 for the o-ring and are available from Porsche.  The
Chilton's labor guides shows 1.2 hrs for the repair.  If you paid
$326.00, my opinion is that it was an extreme amount.  The repair is
very simple, the t-stat is held in only by a snap ring.  You will loose
all of the oil that is in your oil tank.

Good luck...Don Istook

Chris,
   I own a '91 C2 and had an identical problem such as yours that is why
I can speak from personal exp. What has to be replaced is the thermo
valve insert inside the thermostat behind the round outside cover. This
insert part # 930.107.155.00 (1974 and up) costs around $60. This valve
opens @ 180 degrees and allows the oil to flow forward to the front oil
cooler and when temp goes up to 225-230 degrees the fan starts up for
increased cooling capacity.To change this insert you just drain the oil
and remove the  right rocker cover,oil hoses need to be tightened.
When the thermo valve inserts does not work, the oil ( engine )
overheats!!!!!! This will usually happen in the spring when it starts
to work again after having the winter off or at least working part time.
I'm sorry you had to change & remove the  entire thermostat needlessly.
Hope I Helped,
Lorenzo
