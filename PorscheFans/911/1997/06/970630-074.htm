I think my 993 looks best from behind and slightly above, as the 
coke-bottle waist flares into the voluptous hips, er, rear fenders.

I was at Carlsen's bodyshop in Palo Alto recently, and as it is affiliated 
with the Carlsen Porsche dealership there were many P-cars lying around.  I 
counted eight 993's:  C2's, C4S's, and TT's, and ALL of them had damage to 
the right rear corner, some with just the corner crushed in, others with 
much more extensive damage, but all to the right rear corner and nowhere 
else!  The body man I talked to said he's been there eighteen years, and 
have seen hundreds of 911's come through the shop, and he estimates 95%+ 
had the same damaged location.  I guess even AWD and the new rear 
suspension design don't take away the reputation!
