The job is not too difficult if you are not afraid of tight fasteners.  You
need to remove the calipers, of course.  You also need to remove the hub
from the car.  In the back, it come off by removing a couple of screws.  In
the front, you have to pull the dust cap, and remove the nut that sets the
preload on the front wheel bearings.  You should replace the grease seal,
and repack the bearings.  You will also need to know how to set the preload
on the bearings when you install the hub.

The disc is fastened to the hub with socket-head cap screws.  There is
locktite on the threads, so an impact wrench or a long cheater bar are
needed to remove the screws.  Installing the new rotors is no problem. 
Just make sure the mating surfaces are clean, and make absolutly sure you
get the correct torque.  Brakes and wheels are not a place to cut corners. 
Get a good manual, and follow the instructions.  You will need a good set
of allen wrenches, and a torque wrench.   My experience is that very few
shops take the care that an owner does, and if the owner has the correct
information, the results are good.
