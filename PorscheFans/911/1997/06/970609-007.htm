Joe,
I have been using this duster for a while and it is great.  You can
get all the dust off a 911 in about 1 minute without scratching your
paint.  It has some kind of sticky substance on it that really pulls
the gunk right up.  I still wash my car about once a week, but it's
mainly to get the brake dust off the chromed wheels.

Also, don't pay whatever the catalogs want for the duster.  Pick the
large one up at Target for  ~$10.
