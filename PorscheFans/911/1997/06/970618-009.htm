**Things/Facts that the web site does not tell you.

If needed, I might be willing to sell the custom car trailer that I had
made for this car. (I had it made very low, due to the fact that the car
does not have as much ground clearance as other cars or trucks)

I am offering somewhat of a warranty for this car, as to the best of my
knowledge, It is absolutely PERFECT.  For the 1st 2 months, I will pay
for 50% of parts & labor for any repairs other than for abuse.  Upon
inspection of the car I will pay for 100% of repair costs in the
unlikely event that the inspector finds need for repair.

The reason that I am selling the car, is because of tax related problems,
I have filed for an extension, and the clock is ticking.  The price of the
car advertised on the web site is $36,000.00, however I am willing to
entertain any offer over $30,000.00.
