Dennis,

Yes, a stock 3.0L is better than a stock 2.7 but the 2.7 can be rebuilt
with all the upgrades to make it last.  If it's done right, I'd stick with
the rebuilt 2.7 rather deal with an unknown used engine unless
leakdown/compression was done.     Does the $8600 price include labor?
If not, that's steep for a used 3.0 engine.

Unless you're really concerned with originality, this is an opportunity
for more power so a rebuilt 3.0 would be even better.   As an alternative,
Motor Meister in CA advertises rebuilt engines: 3.0 at $3595, 3.2 at $3995
and 3.6 at $4995 for a long block with exchange and warranty.
I have no experience with them. 800-756-0956.

As a data point, I have a  rebuilt Euro Carrera 3.0  which was 
installed for $7k
with the 2.7 traded in.  This includes cams/high-compression pistons, 
RS crank etc.

I think the 3.0 would be the easiest/cheapest to bolt-in keeping the CIS FI.
If your heat exchangers are good, budget for a sport muffler or having
your stock muffler modified (~$150).    With a bigger engine, also budget
for a front oil cooler $500-$1k.   The bigger engines with the '74 
exhaust makes for
a good power-weight ratio in the earlier lighter cars.   Then, there's 
bigger brakes,
suspension....

Some food for thought,
