Chrissy:

It's going to be costly and time-consuming to do the job right... 
You're NOT going to get good results by just sawing the car in half 
with a giant blade.

Here's what I'd do:

Remove everything that needs to look good from the interior.  This
means the dash, the center console, carpets, rear seats, headliner,
etc.  Cut those pieces separately (the glass will be tough to do...
You may want to replace it with Lexan or something).

Remove the front and rear glass and their trim pieces, and the 
bumpers and hoods.  Cut all THOSE pieces separately, too.

Take the body shell to a shop that's cut cars apart before. You're
looking for a body-shop that specializes in street rods or other
large-scale custom bodywork... A shop that's ever built one good car
by splicing together two wrecked cars is an ideal choice.

The body shop will use an abrasive saw or something to cut the car
in half.  As they cut, they'll need to weld mounting plates to the
cut edge, so all the interior/exterior pieces that you removed will
have something to mount to.

Put all the pieces back on the shell, mount them to the plates, bolt 
the whole thing to a sheet of 3/4-inch plywood or something, and nail 
it to the wall.  Personally, I'd mount the car an inch or so AWAY 
from the wall, so minor variations in the straightness of the cut 
won't be obvious.

Good luck... Send photos.
