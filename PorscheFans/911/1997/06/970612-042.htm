The premise of the Reno Tech guys seems a little far-fetched, at least
from a 911 perspective.  A lot of wheels, styles, offsets, etc, have
been used over the years on essentially the same suspension pieces.  It
seems to me that to claim otherwise with the Boxster implies a certain,
ummhhhh, insecurity about the new car's suspension...on the other hand,
they might being verrryyy carfeul.
