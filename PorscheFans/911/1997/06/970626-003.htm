The shop that takes care of my other 4-5 cars tried to set up their analyser
on my 

"73 911, but couldn't get it to read correctly. They said it was something
to do 

with a reversed flow through the coil ??. They have 3+units, and could get
none of 

them to give a correct reading. They went over everything in my shop manuals
and 

could not figure out how to hook it up. This is a well respected shop, and
they have 

taken care of my other car for over 20yrs. This is not a "Porsche" shop, but
they do 

take care of a variety of other makes.. They were trying to do this for me
as a 

favor, and spent about 1-2 hrs trying to get it to work. We were trying to
get a 

"power balance" readout of the cylinders to diagnose a slight high-speed
miss, which 

I think is now a full-blown injector problem. All I have to do now is figure
out 

which cylinder !!!



Their new computor analyzer is a "INSITE" by Matco tools. They also have a
couple of 

"SUN" analyzers.. Has anyone used these ?? I'm sure there is some way to
hook these 

up to my engine. I don't get into electrical problems-- I just do
mechanical!!! We 

have "lost" our Porsche dealership here in TH, so these guys are my best bet
here at 

home. I don't want to run to Indy every time I have a question or problem,
if I can 

help it. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks..

-------------------------

Most of the earlier Sun Analyzers  (including the MCA 3000) have a power
balance feature which removes the spark sequentially from each cylinder for a
few seconds and notes the drop in engine RPM.  The greater the drop in RPM
the more efficiently that cylinder is working.  This scheme worked great on
engines which had a standard ignition where the coil is driven directly from
the points.  It did this by providing a near short across the points which
would preclude the coil from firing on that cylinder.   This process doesn't
work  on the Porsches using the capacitve discharge system (all 911s from
'69(?) through '83) where several hundred volts is sent to the positive side
of the coil  and the negative side of the coil is grounded.   I found out
from Sun that the engineers designed a system which would interface between
the analyzer and the ignition system and there was apparently some success
with this system, but there was not enough commercial sale potential and it
was dropped.  I tried to get the drawings, but they claim all in information
went into archives and I can't talk anyone at Sun into trying to retrieve it.


I have an interface concept drawn up which should work with the Sun MCA 3000
(I own one) but have not had the time to follow through with it.  (You know,
project # 437).  This interface would have to remove the signal between the
distributor and the CDI box so as to not have to deal with switching very
high voltages.  Maybe next year.....

If any one out there has carried this any further,  please let me know.  I
read one posting in response to this subject which indicated that an analyzer
by Matco may have another way to deal with this problem.
