Check the brake fluid level in the reservoir.  Just recently, my 
brake light started coming on intermittently, though my brakes 
appeared to be working fine.  (Sounds sorta familiar, huh.)  When 
I checked my reservoir the fluid level was just a tad low.  So I 
added a bit of brand new brake fluid, and voila! the light went 
dark again.  8^)  (Yes, it still comes on with the parking brake, 
so it's not just a burned-out bulb.)

Hope this works for you too!
