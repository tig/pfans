Well I know this is comming on the end of the thread but I had to 
throw my 2 cents in.  And yes there is a question in here as well.


First,  I agree wholeheartedly open air motoring is the way driving
a sports car was meant to be.  Notice I say motoring not racing.


Second, and I gotta ask this.  Does anyone really use the rear seats in
one of these cars.  Prior to a 964 Cab I had a 951.  My three year old
thought it was cramped!


Third, and for my question.  I have to admit that I occasionally,
oh all-right, usually motor around without the cover on my lowered 
top.  It is always in the back of my mind that I am setting myself
up for an expensive "problem".  Has anyone had their top blown-off?
What is the max speed anyone has gone with the top down and 
uncovered?  I've probably seen 120-130/mph with no cover.
