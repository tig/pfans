Chris:

Pirelli may be right.

I have no personal experience with P-Zeros on a 911, but I DO know 
what works best when those tires (in slightly-larger sizes) are put 
on an NSX:  32 pounds front and rear.

Now, I know that tire pressures for one car usually have no
relationship to pressures on another (especially when one car's
rear-engined and the other's mid-engined), but the spec for the OEM
Yokohamas on the NSX calls for 40 pounds rear and 33 pounds front;
if the Pirellis work best at equal pressures all around on THAT car,
maybe they work best at equal pressures on yours, too.

Just my opinion; I could easily be wrong.
