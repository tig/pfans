Tomorrow I am going to look more closely at a '92 C2 cabriolet with 107k
miles.  It is in the hands of an independent dealer who says they bought it
when it came off lease and that the miles are "highway miles".  It looks to
be in pretty good original shape, with a few little door dings and a slight
depression in the front of the hood where it looks like somebody sat on it.
   It also looks like it will need new tires fairly soon.  It's a very dark
green metallic that probably wouldn't appeal to a lot of people, but does
to me because I want more of a "stealth" Porsche.  (When I drive a red car
I feel like I'm running down the road naked, screaming at the top of my
lungs.  When I drive one with a tail I feel the same way, except I'm
wearing a feather boa.)  They are asking $29,900.  

Does any of this set off any alarm bells?  I will of course have my
mechanic look it over.  I'm starting to despair of finding the perfect
'87-'89, and this one is in my price range.
