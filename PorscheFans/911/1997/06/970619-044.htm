Hi!

I'm looking at buying a very nice looking '84 Targa. I have a couple
questions though. First, as this will be my primary mode of
transportation in the sometimes cruel Chicago winters, does anyone have
any advice and/or experience with this kind of driving? 

Second, as I would like to have the car thoroughly checked out prior to
purchase I would like to take it to a local P-shop. Does anyone out
there in P-Land have any familiarity with a shop in Barrington, Illinois
called Fisher Motors? I have spoken with a mechanic there once or twice,
but I have no basis to judge their competency.

If it's a negative on my second question, is there anyone in the NW
suburbs of Chicago that does inspections on used Porsches that I could
be refered to?

Any and all help is appreciated. Email if you want, or just post a
response.

Thanks!
