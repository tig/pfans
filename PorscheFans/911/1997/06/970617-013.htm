Hi Richard

I had the same combo that you had and I purchased 2 8x16 regular 911
offset wheels.  I moved the 7x16 to the front and the 8x16 to the rear
and will use the 6x16 on an older 911.  I stayed with the same 205
front/225 rear tires and I noticed a significant increase in the
adhesion of the car.  

This has its good and its less good points.  On the plus side better
cornering and a greatly increased feeling of solidity on the road (the
car feels "planted").  The negative of this is that the car feels
heavier and not as "nimble".  Steering force is also increased around
town.  I'm not sure I would want to go to the 8's and 9's for a car that
was not a track car.  

I thought the ride would be harsher on the wider wheels but really
didn't notice any change.  

For comparison purposes my car is an 85 with regular Bilstein Green
shocks (which I find significantly stiffer than stock)  and Toyo F1s
tires.  The rest of the suspension is stock.
