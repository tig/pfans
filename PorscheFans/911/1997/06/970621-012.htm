My 993 came with a Becker unit.  When test driving the car, I asked the 
salesman how it compared with a Blaupunkt since I had never heard of Becker 
and have always been impressed by the sound of the Blaup. Monterey unit I 
once heard.  Well he raised his eyebrows like we don't even compare Becker 
to Blaupunkt.  So I dropped the subject.

I talked to a fairly knowledgeable wrench recently who used to work on 
P-cars (he now works on race cars) about Becker vs Blaupunkt, and he too 
said there was no comparison between the two.  He even said Blaup. is 
considered "junk" compared to Becker.  Since I really liked the sound of 
that Monterey unit a long time ago I must have tin for ears!  And I can't 
really say how I like the Becker unit I now have since the engine drowns 
out most sounds!  Can anybody out there comment on this Becker brand?  I 
saw one in the Automotion catalog for $900, so at least price-wise it's 
positioned as a premium brand.

P-audiophiles...

Does anyone have an opinion on the Blaupunkt 'Vancouver' CD Receiver?

A local dealer is running a very good price on this specific model.
Also... interested in opinions on Blaupunkt CD Receivers in general,
since I am not overly impressed with the 'Reno' cassette model currently
in the car.

TIA

Happy Trails,

Richard
1989 Coupe
