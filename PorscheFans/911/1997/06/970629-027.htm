Would not recommend going below Euro road height for following reasons:

1)  On any sort of parking lot entrance rise or exit dip, will bottom the
front 
of the car, potentially causing damage.

2) The lower you make them, the more neative suspension is introduced
to the point  where you run out of adjusting capability to bring the car in
spec.

3)  As you lower the car, have to raise the rack-&-pinion steering box to 
maintain horizontally level tie rods (to minimize bump steer).

Job could be several hundred $$ - is time consuming in back plus you then
need a 4-wheel alignment.

problems # 1 and 2).

Fans,

I've been talking with a few 911 owners that have lowered their Carreras
and they do look great.  I seem to notice a difference in the degree to
which they have been lowered.  Is there a common or preferred height (i.e..
Euro Spec.?) or is there certain limitations set upon lowering to much?
Also, what would I be looking at in terms of a complete lowering job
considering all operations and costs for a 1987 Coupe?

Joe
