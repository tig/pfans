Hi Ron,

The strut brace makes sense only for the track and only to squeeze out the
last xx% of performance under hard (i.e. deforming) cornering loads which
implies special rubber and alignment.

I had asked the list about the spherical bearing mounts last year.
Camberballs (1) make it easier for you to adjust camber from street to
track settings and (2) remove some of the compliance in the suspension for
crisper handling. So, do you plan to do #1? And are you willing to live
with a tighter, more direct (i.e. bumpy) ride for the street? Just to be
fair though, I did get a response or two from satisfied users who weren't
complaning about ride harshness.

I have a brace cause there's no daily downside and I'm reaching for that
last 5%. I've avoided the camberballs cause I don't want to suffer daily to
gain a benefit on my 10 track days.

Cheers,
-Ez
