The porsche-zen master says, "Grasshopper, you can lever the screwdriver
against the heat exchanger and pop those tube ends in as easy as the oil
flows through the cooler". Not so on the passenger side. Learn to see with
your hands.

The answer to that question lies in the shop manual (which the porsche-zen
master has not handy at this time).

The porsche-zen master says, "There is no substitute--even a VW". Verily, a
pushrod tube is not the same as an oil return.

The porsche-zen master says, "Replace one side, then the other after a
meditative rest". Replace all within a short time so that the natural flow
of time is not altered. You were wise to buy four for the discount, why
burden your soul-mate with tubes lying around the garage?
