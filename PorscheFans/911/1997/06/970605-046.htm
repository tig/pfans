Wow!! Clearly a touchy subject and one with many points of view. Thank you
all for your variety of responses. It would be childish of me to take
offense at any of them particularly as I requested them. This is what has
transpired: After I wrote the note this morning I was pretty upset and asked
the advice of a Porsche club member  who also owns a Porsche maintenance
shop in a town 45 minutes away. He told me that his policy was to encourage
owners to research a part and come to him with the price and if he couldn't
meet it he would add what he felt was a fair markup and do the work, buying
the part from the source that had the good price. He also said that it
didn't sound as if either I or the mechanic were having much fun-right on.
He suggested that I have frank talk with the mechanic and try to clear the
air, which I proceeded to do. He said if everything went south he could come
and pick up my car and motor whcih is on the floor. The job was to be the
clutch, the throwout bearing update and a  60,000 mile service and
replacement of cv joint boots. An estimate was faxed to me only after the
motor was removed from the car. The clutch was the only part I questioned.
All the other part prices, while higher than the Excellence prices were
within reason. I am over fifty years old and have owned many cars and am not
an insensitive jerk ( a little defensive here?) I realized this was not
going to thrill the mechanic. We did have a good talk and he said that he
couldn't buy the clutch himself for $479. I showed him the Excellence
advertisement and he was shocked by how low the prices were. He photocopied
the ad and said he would probably use them. I asked him what he would mark
the clutch up if he bought it for 479 and he said 600. I told him I could
live perfectly well with that. He also said that despite the fact that he
was a bit upset it would not in any way influence the way he serviced my
car. We shook hands and I think we'll be okay.

I think the old restaurant analogy is full of holes just as "you get what
you pay for" has some serious problems. A mechanic has every right to say no
I won't use your parts and I respect that. In this case he told me that the
clutch package would be in the $500 range and then came up with $833.
Certainly if the part were to fail I wouldn't expect him to be responsible
for it and that is a fair price for a $350 savings. A reasonable increase in
hourly rate would be another way that I think would be acceptable.

Thanks again for all your reponses. No one addressed my question about who
all these shops advertising in Excellence are selling to- mechanics,
do-it-yourselfers or people like me?
