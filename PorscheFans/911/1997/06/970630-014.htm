     My girlfriend just bought a 1989 911 Carrera Coupe, black with grey 
     (parchment?) leather, black wheels, spoilers.  Neat car.
     
     We'd like to remove the driver's seat because an aftermarket stereo 
     has been installed there and we need to get to it.  The seat is held 
     to the tracks via six (6mm) Allen head bolts.  Two of these bolts have 
     the inside of them fairly rounded.  Unfortunately, the outside of 
     these bolts is complete round AND it is inside of a trough.  Do you 
     have any suggestions for getting bolts like this out?  Is there 
     another way to remove the seat besides unbolding it from the track?
     
     Also, the car will be going on a fairly long drive over the 4th and 
     its time to change the oil.  I understand it takes 13 quarts.  Good 
     thing my oil catch pan can hold 15 qts.  The only manual we have at 
     this time is the user manual that came with the car.  The Helm manual 
     will be ordered soon.  Is there anything special to a 911 oil change?  
     Any tips or instructions would be great since we won't have the shop 
     manual anytime soon.
     
     Thanks in advance.
