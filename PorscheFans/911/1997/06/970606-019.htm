>Hi Chuck,    
     I've just been reading your post and now that I've stopped laughing so
hard I can type. If you can find the car you describe for $12,000 please let
me know I'll take 2 of them . If you can get the guys name you buy it from
that would be even better because I want to get the next car he wants to
donate to an eager Porsche lover. However I think you should probably look
at getting some good tires for that Subaru if you are planning to autocross
in the next few years.
All kidding aside Good luck Chuck.
