Hey Larry, I also have an '80 SC and replaced my front lid struts.  I know
where you're coming from.  I'll tell you what I did.

I got the pass. side done in about 3 min. and figured I'd be done in another
3 for the other side.  Yeah, right!

I used a magnet on the end of a rod to hold the pin and slide it into the
bottom of the strut while I carefully made the strut line up with the bracket
that holds it.

Now comes the part where you have to put the clip onto the pin to keep it
from coming out.  All I can say is, if you figure out how to do it, let me
know.  I left mine off after about 2 1/2 hours of frustration.  I did this
job two years ago and still have the clip waiting to be installed.  The way I
see it is, there was so much pressure being excerted on that pin even when
the hood was up that I had a hard time getting the pin out.  So there is no
way that pin is coming out with the hood down.

It's been at least 2 years, and I check the pin periodically when I'm
cleaning the car, it hasn't moved a bit.

Like I said, if you figure out a way to do it, let me know.
