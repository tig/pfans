Well, folks, after 11 months of learning to enjoy delayed gratification,
the '68 911 restoration is complete. Well, almost. At least complete
enough to drive away from the shop. I arrived at the shop around 5:00pm
Friday afternoon to pick it up only to find everyone there rushing
around the car doing the final cleanup. After dinner I returned, in a
violent, tornado-filled thunderstorm, to pick it up, and confronted the
following: 
The new battery was dead
the sunroof leaked in my face
the key broke off in the ignition
the defogger wasn't working
Okay, I said to the shop owner, I can take a hint from God. If I try to
get this thing home tonight, I will either run into a hail storm with
footnball sized hail, or into an 18-wheeler I couldn't see out of the
foggy windows. One more day of delayed gratification can't hurt. Roll it
back into the shop, fix the sunroof, get me a new battery, and I'll pick
it up tomorrow, in plenty of time to get to the charity concours on
Sunday.

I did get it next day, but didn't make the concours on Sunday, partly
because of the weather, but mostly because of minor nuisances like the
hood popping up every time the body flexed. No amount of adjustment
would fix it, so apparently new hood locks,top and bottom, are in order.
The fact that the horn honked every time I turned the wheel also
militated against driving to the event. You never know when you are
going to end up behind a gang of outlaw bikers. 

The wait was worth it. the body looks like new. Probably better than
new, in fact. The interior is almost perfect, and will get there after a
couple more minor fixes. And other than a fast idle (2500rpm. Any
suggestions? There is no idle adjustment lever next to the parking
brake.), the engine runs strong and solid. All in all, a car that is for
all intents brand new, and a delight to drive. A literal head-turner.

Lessons learned:
1. Everything will cost exactly twice as much as the original estimate.
2. Everything will take exactly twice as long as the original estimate.
3. But, the satisfaction of getting it done, and done right, will be
twice as great as you think.
