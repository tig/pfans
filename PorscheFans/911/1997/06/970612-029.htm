A while back (maybe 10 months or so ago?) the factory was having a
special on these Black Forest air containers.  Got mine for $779 a
piece; only problem was that I had to buy *5* of those suckers to get
that price.  Since I really wanted to have some genuine Black Forest air
available for my spares, I had the containers air-freighted across the
pond to here (US).  Just on a lark, I had a friend of mine who
autocrosses a track 914 (I don't autocross *yet*) deflate and re-inflate
his track tires with the Black Forest air.  He couldn't *believe* the
difference (noticeable improvement) in handling and track times the
special air made.  Considering this Black Forest air is *supposed* to be
used only in spare tires for a limited time, the track time improvement
really says a lot for the special air.  There has been some degree of
speculation that the Porsche technicians apply some sort of "special
processing" to this air before it's canned; that's why it costs so much.
Keep in mind the factory warranty does *not* apply to the Black Forest
air if used in any *non-spare* tire.  Use is at your own risk.
Anyone else have any experience with the special air?
