A couple of months back I posted a plea for help on a problem I'm having with
the open/closed door sensor and the interior light on my 1993 C2 Cabriolet. 
Most of the recommended solutions told me to check the mechanical switch in
the door, however, this did not solve the problem. So I'm asking for help
again.

I'm sure of this part:
Here's how the circuit works: The interior light that's mounted between the
sun visors has 3 positions: (1) Always ON; (2) Always OFF; and (3) ON when
doors are open, off otherwise. There are 3 leads to the light ass'y: (a) 12
Volts, (b) grounded directly to car body, and (c) switched ground.  [Lead (c)
is not switched 12 volts as many told me].  When the switch is in position (1)
lead (a) and (b) are in the circuit cross the bulb. In pos (2) only lead (a)
is in the circuit; and in position (3) leads (a) and (c) are across the bulb.

The switched ground works like this: When the car door is open the plunger
switch mounted in the door jamb springs out making a connection between the
lead and the door, grounding the circuit. Back at the light, this places a
ground on one side of the bulb and with +12V on the other side the bulb
illuminates. When the door is shut the plunger is depressed and the connection
between the lead and door is broken essentially placing an open in the circuit
and no current flows thru the bulb. 

According to the owner's manual there is a delay relay built into this circuit
so when you first get into the car and shut the door the interior light stays
on for awhile (automatically goes out when car is started, doors are locked,
or timer expires). This complicates the circuit somewhat. 

My problem is that the light is always ON in position (3). This is caused by
the fact that the switched ground lead (c) is always grounded, even when the
doors are shut. This tells me that somewhere between the door and the light,
the circuit is grounded. I don't have the circuit diagram, but I think this is
all that is between those two points:

1. the delay relay
2. some wire
3. the alarm/door lock control unit (see below)

Here are some other problems that may or may not be related to this:

  o The factory alarm/door lock control unit under the passenger seat that the
door circuit hooks into is causing another problem.  This unit is currently
responsible for a 100 milliamp drain (out of 130 mA total) when the car is off
that has killed my battery.  I currently have to unplug the two plug
assemblies into the unit (or disconnect my battery) to keep it from killing my
new battery when I park my car. I would imagine this battery drain problem is
related to the light problem.  I don't know all what this part does but I do
know that it costs about $300 and there is a 26-pin and a 12-pin (about)
connector hooked to it so it's not a simple device.

  o My after market car alarm system is also wired into this circuit for
automatic door opening and sensing of door status. It's also getting screwed
up by the door being sensed as open even when it's shut.

Here's what I've done so far (obviously nothing's worked):

1. Removed and cleaned the door switches even though they looked fine. 
2. Replaced the interior light which was not a smart move and a waste of $20.
Anyone need a light?
3. Took the car back to the alarm installer who verified the alarm isn't the
problem. I trust him and what he's said makes sense. My Porsche mechanic
agrees (hopefully not just because he wants the $60/hour job chasing this
problem).

I plan to work on this problem this weekend when I get back home. The first
thing I will do is check to see which door circuit is permanently grounded. If
the answer is both, then I'll suspect the problem is in the delay relay part
of the circuit, or the  alarm/door lock control unit. If only one is grounded,
then maybe somehow one of the door leads is individually grounded. The problem
is I suspect all the wiring is buried so it'll be difficult to find the fault.

My questions to anyone who might help is (finally, sorry this took so long):

A. Has anyone had a similar problem or worked on this circuit who could help
me?
B. Where is the delay relay?
C. How can I check to see if it's the alarm/door lock control unit under the
seat? I wish I could swap it out with a good one but it costs $300 and I'd
have to order it. Too expensive to try without being sure.
D. If it's the wire, how can I replace the lead with the least amount of pain?
E. What are all the functions of the alarm/door lock control unit?

I'm looking forward to any advice before I start out on this problem this
weekend.  I'm hoping I can solve this without turning it over to the shop at
$60/hour.

Sorry this was so long but I wanted to avoid beyond told to "clean the door
switches" since I'm well beyond that.

Thanks in advance,
Paul
