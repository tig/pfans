You need to remove the  front and rear windows. In fact, any paint shop
worth a sh*t will insist upon it. Although there are many methods for
laying cord or wire under the edge of window seals to allow paint under the
edge, there is no reliable means of doing so.

My wide-body conversion and paint job took nearly a year. Often the folks
who are good at painting are lousy at managing their tiime. Most body shops
rely mainly on insurance jobs which are incredibyly profitable, but  are a
bear to deal with between the parts supply delays, paperwork, adjuster
idiosyncracies and 'supplemental allowances'.

I had the same guy do the color change and bumper updates on my Carelli
conversion (which was a pearlescent mess, thanks to the P.O.). In neither
case did I get anything in writing, and in both cases, the deal was
understood to be priced at a 'cash discount'.

In theory, paint shops should prefer this type of work, since they are
starting with a happy owner and making him happier (as oppposed to a
collision repair where the owner is unhappy, and they're hoping to bring
him back to neutral).

In my experience, these are not normally removed.
