Robb, here's my comments and additions to Ed's procedure:

Before you take off the caliper, open a bleed screw and depress the =
brake pedal half-way or so.  Use a piece of wood between the brake pedal =
and the front seat to hold the pedal part way down.  This will help most =
of your brake fluid stay in the reservoir.  Otherwise when you remove =
the caliper, it will all drain out and let air into the system.

>or what's left of it. Notice the position of the pistons with the notch
>at a 20 degree angle to the top of the caliper.  Ate makes a metal tool
>to use to put in here.  I had one scribed and cut out for me.  This is

I just used a protractor and made one out of cardboard.  You only need =
it as a guide.  The notch is aligned so the rotation of the rotor is =
towards it. If your calipers are mounted on the front of you brake disks =
like on my SC, that means the notch always faces upward and towards the =
rear of the car. The Haynes manual shows this.

>Put a rag for padding in between the two pistons.  Using compressed air
>and a rubber tipped air nozzle inserted into the brake line inlet
>(making sure the bleeder valve is shut) blow out one of the pistons.

I used a strip of wood between the pistons, and put the rag over =
everything.  When the first piston comes out, you'll likely get a spray =
of brake fluid, and the rag will catch it.=20

I was able to use a small plug-in Black and Decker compressor for this.  =
Even a 12 volt compressor should work.  My B&D compressor came with =
adapters to inflate mattresses, beach balls, inflatable dolls, etc.  =
This worked well in the brake line inlet.  The fact there wasn't a =
complete seal probably kept the pistons from flying out as violently as =
they would have otherwise.  There may be some brake fluid spray (where =
safety glasses).

I used isopropyl alcohol to clean everything up.  Make sure there are no =
pits on the outside of the pistons.  If there are, you need new ones.  I =
cleaned my pistons with the alcohol and the finest steel wool I could =
find (000 or 0000).  Scotchbrite pads would probably be better.

>Use compressed air again to clean out the fluid passages.  Take the
>pistons and GENTLY lift the old seal out.  Clean this piston good and
>just slip the new seal on.  Wipe some new brake fluid inside the =
caliper
>bore and some on the piston seal, to lubricate it for insertion.  Now

I think Ed misspoke here.  The seal is actually in the bore of the =
caliper.  Take it out carefully (I used a dental pick) and clean out the =
groove the seal was in.  Then carefully fold in the new seal.

When putting the pistons back in, you need to apply pressure with the =
C-clamp to the middle of the piston to keep them from canting.  The =
piston should slide in nice and smoothly.  If not, it's probably crooked =
and you need to pull it out and start again.  Because the piston is =
hollow towards the pad, you'll need some kind of flat plate to put =
across it so the C-clamp has something to press on.  When the piston is =
part way in, check the 20 degree angle and if necessary turn the piston =
to get it right.  You can use pliers, but only on the outermost lip of =
the piston, where the boot goes.

After I got each caliper back together, I polished them up a bit with a =
brass brush on my electric drill.  Be sure to seal the brake line port =
to keep debris from getting inside.  Do this outside, as the old caked =
on brake dust will have asbestos in it.

Good luck!
