Tony,

Had the following lying in my archives.  I think the location is much
closer to you. =20

By the way, still trying to troubleshoot my driveability problems.  I've
got most of the parts to replace the spark system.  Now just finding the
time and a substitute for the $250 wires.  If this doesn't work, I'll
pursue you injector cleaning routine.

Hi all,

I bought the Optima battery and wanted to give the list (and Victor Lee)
some feedback on this particular brand.
The battery should not do any corrosive damage as it is a
sealed unit. It is substantially smaller than the battery that I had
in there. In order to secure the battery, one can buy a lexan tray on whi=
ch
the battery is mounted and secured by some of those plastic ties. It
should be noted that on my car (84 911) the standard ground cable did not
reach the negative battery post. Therefore, add $10.00 to the price of th=
e
battery to make things work. I also bought with the battery, the tray,
and the ground cable, one of those quick disconnect knobs. One attaches
it to the neg. ground, turns the knob to the left to disconnect and to
the right to connect. I LOVE THIS THING! I disconnect the battery just
for fun now :) Certainly worth the $10 some dollars that I paid.
Finally, I would like to recommend Chatham Motorsports in Vinton VA (they
advertise the Optima in the classified (small print) section of Pano).
They were a bit hard to get a hold of, but one I did, they were very
friendly and offered substantial discount for PCA. The battery, tray and
disconnect knob came in at $155 shipping included.

Geert
