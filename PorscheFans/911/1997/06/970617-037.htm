Hey dudes,

I have a couple of question for you.  For those that have tracked their
964 C2's, how does your car compare to a 951 (944 Turbo)?  In your comments,
let me know if you have your 911 modified or not.  I am curious as to their
performance level in comparison to the 951.  I would assume that in auto-x,
they are way faster than the 951, but how about the track and the street?

Has anyone seen 1/4 mile figures for the C2?  What MPH does it pull through
the 1/4 mile?

Todd, how did it feel to go from the RX-7 Turbo to the C2 Cab?  Do you miss
the turbo rush?  Does the C2 have a peaky powerband or is it all flat.  If
I move to a C2 from my 89 951, I'm afraid I'll miss that rush of power the
turbo has.  Some C2 owners have mentioned that the powerband on the C2 is
much like a turbo, just no lag, all above 4500rpm, is this true?

Email me direct with the answers please.

Farzaan.
