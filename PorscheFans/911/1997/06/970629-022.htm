Talk to your bank/credit union.  You should be able to find something in
the neighborhood of 13% or so as a car loan(better with a credit union,
but this is a decent starting point).  If you're looking at a car that's
over twenty years old (like I was), you have to either hope they will
accept the appraisal of the car as its value or put up with an unsecured
loan (20%+, but possibly transferable to credit cards at a more favorable
rate.

When figuring out how much you have to spend, remember to include the
first trip to the mechanic and possibly a set of tires.  When I went
through this, the car I bought had new tires, but the work required on
the car to get it running as well as I wanted came to about 40% of the
purchase price of the car.  Since you're looking at a newer car, this
fraction should be smaller but don't expect it to be cheap.  Good luck!
