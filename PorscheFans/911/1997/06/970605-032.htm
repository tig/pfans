Gee Dave, as I understand it the issue was on the difference in cost of OEM 
parts; $479 vs. $833.  I'm  gonna get a bit frosted when I can buy a part for 
that much less and the mechanic insists on buying much more expensive parts.  
I don't expect him to take no profit on the parts, but the fact is(and you 
suggest that the original poster didn't understand retailing) that my mechanic 
isn't a retailer.  If he was and was going to survive as such, he wouldn't 
make it with 60% markups!!!!  If I can buy a part for significantly less than 
my wrench can, I'll tell him where to get it and to mark it up to cover 
handling.  
 
This is what I've done in the past and have had good results.  Most of us are 
willing to pay a premium for good work and better service but few of us will 
be back if we feel we've been gouged by parts, labor or what have you.....my 
..02......or should I have marked it up to .04..?:)

I see the problem from both sides.   I run a small Porsche-only shop and I am a 
Porsche owner.   You are not the first to take issue with this situation,
and will
probably not be the last.    

You are absolutely justified in wanting to get the job done correctly and as
cheaply as possible.   What I have found, however, is that those who think
that bringing their own parts into such a job simply don't understand
retailing.   The basic issue is making a living.  If you buy a case of oil
at a parts store for $12, you can bet that the store paid only $6 for it.
That is the way of the retail world.   I am acquainted with a local hearing
aid salesman who marks his product up 400%(!) and is known for his low
prices.   The same basic principle applies to the Porsche shop owner who
expects to make a certian profit on a given job.   Just because YOU think
that making $100 on the clutch parts is a good deal for him, does not ensure
the HE does.   And I happen to know that most of the aftermarket retailers
charge everybody a lower price than my wholesaler for a clutch kit.

Then there is the issue of a warranty.    Do you really expect a warranty on
such a job?   You have denied the owner his expected profits, and brought
parts into his shop that may or may not be genuine, etc.   

I don't know what you do for a living, whether you are on salary, or work by
the hour, but I suspect that you do not discount your services, and I am
mystified as to why one might think that a shop owner should do just that
for the privilege of fixing YOUR car.   While labor rates vary somewhat, and
there is always some wiggle room on parts markups, quite frankly I have to
be pretty hungry to do a job under the conditions you bring to the table.   

Please do not misunderstand the tone of this post either.   This is a
gentle, padded soap box.   The frequent outcome of this discussion is that
everybody chooses up sides and thrashes each other for a week or so, and
then we get back to business.   The cold facts of life say that Porsche
ownership is relatively expensive, and it doesn't matter if the car is new
or twenty five years old.   That shop owner wants your business.   He also
wants to feed his kids.

The decision point, and point at which you may legitimately castigate the
shop owner, is after you accept his estimate.   Until then, you are simply
free to find another shop with an owner who is just a little hungrier.
