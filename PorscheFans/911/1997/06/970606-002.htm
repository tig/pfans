Dennis,

This is very common, and is usually a failing speedo
sending unit.  The gismo is simply an inductive pickup
placed in the driver's side of the transmission just
above the rear wheel half shaft.  Replacement is
easy, but a little dirty (as any under car repair).
The sensor wire goes over the transmission and into
wire harness tunnel between the seats.  It clips into
the wire harness at a point accessible through an
access panel which is under the carpet between the
footwells of the rear passenger jump seats.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne

          First off, let me apologize if this has been the subject of
          recent discussion.  The speedo quit on my '87 coupe the
          other day.  This morning it worked for a couple miles and
          quit again.  Any suggestions of things I might look at
          before calling the mechanic would be appreciated

          Thanks again
          Dennis Dodd
