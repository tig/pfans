No answers here, just more questions.

The two driver-side oil return tubes on my '85 911 are leaking, and I want
to replace them. I have read Bruce Anderson's brief directions for removing
the old tubes in the June Excellence. I have already bought some of the
collapsing oil return tubes. Since this will be the first time I'm doing
anything on the engine, I want to know everything I can going in.

It looks like it is almost impossible to do without removing the heat
exchanger (passenger side looks possible, but driver's side does not). Right?

When replacing the heat exchanger, will I need new exhaust manifold gaskets?
If so, what is involved in treating these gaskets before installation?

It appears I'll need a special tool (short ended allen wrench) to get the
heat exchanger off.  Any suggestions?

For the collapsible replacement tubes, which tube (thick or thin) goes next
to the case, and which next to the head?

Should I expect any problems removing the old and replacing the new tubes? I
ask, because I remember rebuilding my VW Vanagon engine and removing and
replacing the pushrod tubes was very difficult, even with the engine
removed, etc.

Also, before I looked carefully, I figured I'd replace all 4 tubes, so I
bought 4. Upon closer inspection, the two passenger side tubes look just
fine. Would you recommend replacing all or just the leaking ones?

Thanks in advance for any advice.
