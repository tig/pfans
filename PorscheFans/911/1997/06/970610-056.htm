A repost from the distant past .........


*************************************************************

Summer=92s heat and humididty is your early 911s enemy because  since bot=
h
enhance conditions for the evil R word... rust.

We all know one of the most vulnerable areas for corrosion on early 911s
are the battery boxes. Last weekend I decided to check these out very
carefully for the first time (I received the car in March and it was
being mechanically restored during April and May). The appraiser who
performed the prepurchase inspection reported the battery box area was
in amazingly good condition. It turns out he was correct. NO corrosion
of the battery boxes was noted(in case you're wondering the floor
pan/battery boxes are original). However the positive terminals had
quite a bit of white powder (lead sulfate) present. Several cells were
pretty low on both batteries.

After removal of the batteries the terminal corrosion was cleaned and
the outside and bottom of the batteries was washed and rinsed several
times. The batteries were filled with distilled water and dried. Next
plastic (dry cleaning bags) was spread out around the battery box area.
The terminals and bolts were carefully cleaned of all corrosion until
fresh (shinny) lead could be seen. The battery box areas were then
vaccumed. The boxes and area around the boxes was washed with a very
damp cloth. This was repeated several times in order to dilute out any
acid or salts. Rinsing with a basic solution could be counter productive
as the process produces salts which could be corrosive as well. The
entire area was then carefully dried.=20

Then WD-40 was liberally sprayed throughout the battery box area. The
terminals were coated with lithium grease... the battery posts got the
same treatment. The batteries were replaced and reconnected. The ground
strap chassis connectors were filed to shinny metal and carefully
tightened. The entire area was resprayed with WD-40.

When these batteries die (note- trns out they lasted 2 more years ),
I=92ll replace them with sealed units (I actually replaced them with two
conventional batteries for weight distribution and originality
purposes). Hopefully I=92m on the way to keeping this area rust free for
another 23 years!

We all pay attention to waxing during the summer months. This is a
friendly reminder to attack the battery boxes as well to help keep our
old Porsches intact.

The battery boxes remain in excellent condition with  an annual cleaning
and re-oiling. Not overfiling the batteries and making sure the charging
system is working properly is also a good idea. If my car spent time on
the track (it hasn't yet) I'd remove some of the electrolyte  ( it's
easy with a turkey baster or a large syringe) as part of the pre-track
preparations and check for spills and clean/re-oil afterwards.
Convetional batteries do not automatically mean your battery boxes and
floor plan ares doomed. My car is living proof.
