It has pulled to the right since I bought the car last year, but the PO
said the problem could easily be fixed with 4 wheel alignment.  I 
figured
that I would hold off until the 90,000 mile service this spring in 
order to
get $50.00 dropped off the price.  Howerver, when the car was in, the
dealer said that he could not align the wheels becasue the sway bar was
bent.  He suspected that the car had run over something earlier in its
life.  Can the sway bar be bent back to its original form?  What part
number should I use to replace it if need be?  Should I buy used?  Can 
this
be done in my garage?

Buy a good used swaybar.  Trying to repair the one you have is a waste 
of time.  Drop 944 Ecology a line at georgeb@mhv.net.

Also:  I have a leaking clutch hose.  My dealer showed me the hose when 
the
car was on the rack.  It does not seem to be listed in any of the main
parts books (Tweeks, Auto Atlanta, Performance Products, Automotion). 
 The
hose is pretty much in a vertical position and located near the front 
of
the car and pretty much in the center.  The dealer said that the hose 
would
run about 100.00.  Any ideas on what hose this is?

There are two hoses.  One is a braided blue line running from the 
reservoir to the clutch master cylinder, which Porsche sells by the 
meter, p/n 999.924.001.40.  The other is a two-part hose running 
between the master and slave cylinders.  The part numbers depend on the 
year and model, but for you should be 951.423.091.11 for the solid 
pipe, 951.423.189.01.
