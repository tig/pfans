Is there a way of finding out the original owner of one's 911?  I
checked with PCNA re cardex details and they said that for the $30 up
front fee you get the basics in a pretty hunk of cardboard and that
doesn't include the original owner's name...

As I already got this info from Ludwigsburg for free, this seems to be a
revenue raising stunt.  Anyhow I know my 1972 911 was delivered new to
the "Burlingame" dealership.  I've been told that CA State laws forbid
the divulgance of the name of the original owner.  Is this true?
Doesn't PCNA have the records of the first owners of all Porsches sold
in USA from the early seventies?  Can a search of past CA
registration/title details of my car be done?

I really only want to find the past sevice info on my car from the
original owner and if possible track down the original papers/log book
as well.  Help!!  Anyone had this experience who knows a way through the
maze...
