John,

I have had my 68 911T for over a year now. The car had been idle
for almost two years, and was parked outside in an envirnoment
that induced some surface rust. I have driven the car almost
3000 miles during the first year (I believe the car has 168,000
miles, although I do not know for sure). The engine/transmission
are original and I have not had any problems. All the work
done to the car was aimed at bringing it back to life (brakes,
shocks, exhaust repair, tires).

There were quite a few oil leaks: Valve covers, oil return tubes,
oil tank nut, oil lines. However they have all been fixed and
no new leaks have come up.

I would agree with the other 68 911 owners in that it is a
wonderful, although not overly fast, car.

I purchased my car for $1500 and have invested about $3500.
However, the bulk of that money was at the beginning. I have
only changed the oil and replaced the schocks in the last 6 months.

I have seen these cars sell for $4000-$10000 in San Diego, with
an avereage of about $7000-$8000 for a good example.
