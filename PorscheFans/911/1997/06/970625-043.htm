You are right that alarms don't help much. My suggestion is you install a
kiil switch. I had one installed that has a relay and kills the DME *and*
the fuel pump. The secret switch activates those two things, until you turn
off the engine; at that point you have to use the switch again to start it.

What this means is that the only way to take the car is with a tow truck,
or in a carjacking situation were the engine stays on. In either case they
won't be able to start the engine again after they turn it off unless they
either take the trouble to find out how the whole system operated, which
should take quite a while unless they know *exactly* what they are looking
for (doubtful), or they can be extremely lucky and find the switch (also
dobtful).
