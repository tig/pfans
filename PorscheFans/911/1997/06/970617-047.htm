My windshield is scheduled to be replaced next Tuesday, due to it's
second bullseye, in as many years - this one is too big to fix, and it's
right in the line of sight.

State Farm has arranged for "Vistar" to do the replacement - when I spoke
with them today, they knew enough to ask if it had an antennea built in,
but not much more.  The brand of replacement glass is Sigla (sp?), which
they claimed is factory original.   I'm pretty sure this is incorrect, as
all the other windows have the "Sekurit" logo on them.  Oddly enough,
only the front window doesn't have this logo - maybe the previous owner
replaced the original?

Anyway, here's my questions, directed primarily at '84 -'89 owners...
1) Does your 911 have any manufactuer markings on the front windshield?
2) Are all '84 - '89 windshields tinted at the top?  (Mine is) 
3) I presume it's standard procedure to replace the gasket, yes?
4) Anything else I should be asking?

Thanks,
