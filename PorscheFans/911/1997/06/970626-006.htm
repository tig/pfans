Hi All!

I did my second track event at Grattan Raceway in Grattan, Michigan
yesterday.  I had a riot!  I was very suprised how quickly I learned the
track.  I went with an instructor in his car for about 3 laps until he broke
a header and had to come in.  He then went with me in my car for one
session and then I was on my own!  Four sessions and no spins!  I told
myself not to be too crazy and drive within my limits and no spins.

Grattan is a interesting road course with a very tricky blind off camber
turn and a hill which you crest and then go very quickly into a sharp right
hander.  Those were the two areas of the track that I was concerned about.
When you come off the hill you have to wait until the weight of the car comes
back down on the suspension before you can brake for the right hand turn,
very interesting!  By the end of the day I was doing 140 mph down the
straight
and had a good line around the entire track, sorry no lap times.  This was
a Porsche event so mostly Porsche's, it was interesting following a couple
VW Golf's before I passed them and watching them go around the corners and
lifting the right rear tire completely off the ground!!  Probably the most
interesting
car there was a 1965 Porsche 356 Convertible and yes he ran it on the track.

He is German and bought the car in Austria in 1967, the same car for 30 years
wow what a concept.  It was a very beautiful car.  Anyway the weather was
great
the track was awesome and I had a blast!!!
