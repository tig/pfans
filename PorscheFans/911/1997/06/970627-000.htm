Well, I'm almost ready to bring my car into the shop for painting.  I've
been stripping the car of all its trim.  Tonight I removed the exterior
door handles to remove the rubber trim on them.  I cant believe that the
last shop that painted the car didn't even have the decency to remove
them.  

I noticed that when I replaced the door handles, the drivers side one
now operates differently when locked.  Before, if the door was locked
you could still pull the trigger on the handle.  Now you cant, its
stiff.  But if I unlock the door, the handle operates normally.  What is
the proper operation of the handle when the door is locked??  SHould the
trigger be stiff or moveable??

ANother question I've got is what is the best way to remove the doors?
I've heard that its better to pull the pins out of the hinges so you
don't lose alignment, the way you would if you unbolt the hinges at the
door jamb.  But how do you remove the pins?  Especially the lower ones
which have the head of the pin on top.  The top pins have the head on
the bottom and can probably be banged out with a hammer and screwdriver.

Thought I'd also mention that so far, every bit of the original silver
on my car has turned yellowish.  Most likely its the clearcoat that has
yellowed.  I guess they didn't make very robust clearcoats back in '73.

Thanks
Steve
