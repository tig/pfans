Hi, Russell.

I have seen the Litronic lights in action, though don't have a car that
uses them. The think the HID (High Intensity Discharge) technology is
basically the same as your typical mercury vapor street light, adapted to
the automobile. If someone else know for sure, please chime in. I
personally do not like the color of the light. They are certainly capable
of throwing a good deal more light per watt than halogen lights, but I
don't know if they are giving more light at the same wattage as cars
equipped with halogens, or if they are giving the same lumen output but
consuming fewer watts.

A/C in the 964 and 993 series is good, that in earlier 911s not as good. My
1990 C4 has an A/C that is quite adequate for humid 90 degree plus weather.
