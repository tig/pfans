> Steve, the first thing to look for is a seal leak. Look up on the deck

> lid just over the area where the comp. sits, if you see a line of oil
> or
> dust on the lid going the same way as the belt, the seal is the
> culprit.
> If no trail is there, check to see that the hoses are tight where they
>
> attach to the Comp. There should be no verticle movement of the hoses
> if
> you carefully try to lift or push down on the hoses. Don't break them
> loose if they aren't already loose, but if they are loose the Comp.
> must

> point
> must be removed and ONE square cut gasket be installed with Refrig.
> Oil.These are the two most common leaks that you should look for, of
> course you should have the tech. look at the entire system for other
> leaks too. Hope that helps....Roger
