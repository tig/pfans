I've had my '72 911T for close to 3 years now.  I bought it when it had
92,000 miles on it and I have since added about 50,000 more.  As long as
you watch the oil and valve clearances (just like with any other 911
engine), you should not be too disappointed.  I haven't actually driven
an S, but have been told repeatedly that while the S has more top end
power (and a red line of 7250 instead of 6250 for the T), the T has a
much wider power band that makes it more friendly for day-to-day driving.
