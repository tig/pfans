   Can't help myself.  Just have to share a (modestly) great technique for
replacing the front hood support struts.  Ordered a pair of the Automotion
heavy duty Weltmeister units.  The passenger side is easy, but the lower
pin on the drivers side is impossible (at least on my '84  930).  Fuel
filler pipe and wire harness prevent getting your fingers in to re-insert
the bottom pin.
  Solution - After carefully cleaning, I glued (using a hot glue gun) a
tough thin string directly on the end of the pin.  Then took a small, stiff
wire and formed a small hook at the end.  Pushed the hooked wire through
the support bracket and new strut, caught the string, and pulled it
through.  Once you grab the string, use it to gently pull the pin (so as
not to dislodge the glued string from the end of the pin) back through the
assembly.  When the pin is in place, it's easy to slide on the end clip,
which cuts off the glue and string.  You're Done!
   Suppose after posting this method, I'll be told of several easier ways,
but hopefully it will be a few years before I have to replace the gas
struts again.
   Sure is nice to toss out that stick of wood previously used to keep the
hood from bouncing off my head.
