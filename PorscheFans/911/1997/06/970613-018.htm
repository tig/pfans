After seeing a couple of the reactions to "Porsching", I feel compelled to
comment in Chris Welty's defense. Prior to his defection downriver, Chris
dwelt in Hudson-Champlain Region of PCA, where he ably edited our newsletter
for a number of years. 

Chris has owned, driven, worked on, repaired, restored, and cussed at a
certain orange '71 911T for longer than I can remember. Although it has been
the butt of many jokes (most of which he wrote) he has kept it. I think
that's a sign of something other than "vindictives"..... 

......... Lunacy, perhaps, but not vindictiveness.

Here in the Albany area, we're really familiar with Chris's dry, dry wit. In
fact, the Chris Welty Memorial Water Fountain was installed to revive those
of us who became dehydrated while reading Chris's newletter columns. :)

What some miss in reading Chris is his context, which, I admit, he isn't
very good at establishing. ;) However, he's an unabashed enthusiast who can
love the breed while snickering at its faults.

I drove a '68 911 Targa for many years, and can understand Chris's satire,
becuase I shared some of his experiences in my car. Face it, folks, if we
didn't laugh at some of the stranger engineering "solutions" Porsche has
arrived at over the years, we'ld be weeping forever. Without presuming to
judge anyone's sense of humor, perhaps a bit lighter response might be
considered.

And to Chris....... think about a little wetter wit.  :) (ba-da-BUM)
