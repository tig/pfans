Pfans,

In a rare display of patience and perserverance, I have
triumphed over my stuck oil line problem (I needed to
replace one of my oil lines that attaches to the thermostat
in order to get my headers installed and it was stuck at
the nut that attaches it to the thermostat).

Chuck at PAP gave me this tip and it worked so well I
thought I'd pass it on.  Using a small hacksaw (a "keyhole"
saw), I made an axial cut in the nut.  I cut down to the
point where I could *just* make out the underlying
threads in the thermostat housing.  I then placed a
chisel that was more "blunt" than the cut in the nut into
the resulting groove and whacked it with a hammer a few
times.  Voila!  The nut split and I was able to thread it
off of the thermostat housing and remove the oil line.

Best of all, the threads on the thermostat housing were
preserved (actually they look like new).  I had heard
horror stories of these oil line nuts taking the thermostat
threads off with them - this method seems to mitigate
the chances of damaging the thermostat.

Anyway, the headers are on the car.  I still need to put the
oil line on and do about a hundred other little things, but
it should be downhill from here...

Thanks to everyone who offered tips and moral support...
