Michael (and others)-  Thanks for the reply - here's my answers...

>Does the reverse light on the right side work?
Yes

>Does the right side license plate light work?
Yes

>Is the oil tank level gauge doing funny things?
Nope

>All of these are powered through the same harness.
So it sounds like this isn't the answer.  In fact, the parking light
function (key out, turn directional on to right) which uses the same two
bulbs, DOES work.   I also checked the connections in the right-rear of
the engine compartment, and they looked okay. Mind you, I didn't spend
much time under the hood checking these, as it's hot enought to work up a
sweat just by breathing today.

I looked at the fuse box, and all the fuses look okay.  Oddly however,
there is no fuse specifically listed for the rear running lights, right
or left.  Is there a fuse and/or relay hidden away somewhere else? 

Making progress, but not quite there...

Thanks again,

Brad
