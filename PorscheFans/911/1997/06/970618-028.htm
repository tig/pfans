I just finished signing the papers on an 86 Turbo.  The car was at my 
mechanics yesterday for a very thorough inspection including pulling the 
intercooler, lowering the engine to pull plugs and check compression etc. 
 The only problems found with the car was a small leak coming from an oil 
line going to the thermostat and a slight leak from the cam chain housing 
area.  I will have these addressed at the next oil change, and next major 
service.  Thanks to everyone who replied last week to my cries for help 
concerning the purchase of a turbo car, and what to expect for service 
and maintenance.  I take delivery on the car tomorrow, and am so excited 
that I will probably not sleep well tonight!



I have already ordered new 17" C2-Turbo wheels from Robert Wood at Wheel 
Enhancement to update the cars looks (have grown weary of the Fuchs 
alloys as I have had them on 3 previous cars).  I would like to know if 
anyone is interested in either the original wheels and tires, or just the 
tires.  Mr. Wood has offered $900.00 trade in for the alloys, but did not 
have an interest in the tires.  Nitty-Gritty... Factory Fuch alloys, 
black w/black center caps from 1986 911 Turbo, 7X16 Front  9X16 rear.  
Wheels are in very good condition, left rear has small curb rub about the 
size of the end of my little finger.  I believe all the other wheels are 
perfect, I will have the car Thursday and can scrutinize better for 
anyone with an interest.  The tires are Dunlop SP8000's.  They have been 
on the car approx. 4 Months and have at least 90-95% tread remaining.  
Sizes 205/55 ZR16 Front and 245/45 ZR16 Rear.  I checked Discount Tire's 
pricing in the current "Excellence" and they show $582.00 for the set 
new.  Asking $400.00 O.B.O.for tires only, or $1300.00 for wheels, tires, 
and center caps.  I live in the Phoenix area, but will have the boxes 
from the new wheels so I could ship in the US paid by purchaser.  



Glad to be a part of this list and look forward participating!
