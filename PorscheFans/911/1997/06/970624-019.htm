I am still involved in a project to put probably headers and heat exchangers 
on my car.  I am trying to determine whether to spend big bucks or not.  Part 
of the expense is the cost of installation.  I am pretty good with a wrench ( 
did my complete suspension solo ), so I thought if I could do it myself I 
could save a few bucks and buy better stuff.  The only problem was the stories 
about removing studs with the exhaust nuts. a friend suggested that I put the 
car on stands for a few days and take off the nuts slowly add antiseize and 
put them back on so I could easily get them off if I wanted to install new 
exchangers.

It works.  I sprayed liquid wrench on each.  Reached under with my left hand 
only and applied pressure with about out a 6 inch handle.  At first only 2 
came off.  Spray some more, tap on them with a small hammer, let them set for 
several hours and try again.  Over 3 days of me trying about 2 times a day all 
12 came off with an easy twist.  Replaced all with new using copper nuts on 
the hex heads and antiseize.  I figure the only problem left is the oil line.  
 I can do this.
