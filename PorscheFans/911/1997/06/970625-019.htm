Nill, I'm almost positive that the early C2 cabs did have rear seats.  =
If I
remember, these were deleted in the late C2 cabs because of changes in =
US seat
belt laws.  Porsche couldn't get the rear 3-point belts to meet the sta=
ndard,
because the top anchor point would be too low.  So they just removed th=
e seats.

As far as earlier 911s, I think the 3.2 Club Sport (1988?) came without=
 rear
seats, as did the 1989 Speedster.
