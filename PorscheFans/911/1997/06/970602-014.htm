After the talk of the great 930 chase in "No Man's Land", I called up
my local Wherehouse and reserved a copy to rent.  The guy at the store
was chuckling, so I figured he'd seen the movie. =20

I'll spare you the details of a very embarrasing scene in which a
grinning kid handed me the movie, complete with naked woman on the
front cover, to the disapproving clucks of mothers of young children
waiting in line.

Just be sure that if you call your video store, tell them it's the "No
Man's Land" with Charlie Sheen!    :-O

BTW the movie (the clean one) is OK, worth the rent for the cars but
not the dialog.  No comments on the other one :)

On another subject, I spent a few hours cleaning up my '88 Targa today
and was having a hard time applying protectant to the tiny little
strips of rubber running back to front from the windshield to the top
of the hood.  The pieces are cracking, so I guess the previous owner
had the same problem and gave up.  Any suggestions?

Also, I noticed for the first time that the headlamp rings are
identical.  That is, the screws are on the right and bottom on each
piece, making the car's appearance assymetrical.  Are these rings
supposed to be identical or mirror images of each other?

=46inally, a recommendation for Meguiar's three step system.  After
washing my car I used the Step  2 polish and then the Step 3 wax.  It
looks better than ever before (took out all the swirl marks), and the
products are not too expensive.  No commercial interest, just a
satisfied customer.
