Actually leather is not pretty much leather. There is a big difference 
in the way the Germans and say the British treat their leather. The 
Germans surface dye, therefore, you can see abrasions because the undyed 
leather is exposed and you can change the color of your seats by using a 
stripper... the British permeate the entire hide. 

The problem with shoe dye is that it may contain nasties like Petroleum 
products and other unfriendly ingredients that will actually deteriorate 
your leather seats. You are also very fortunate that the color did not 
rub off.

In other words... shoe dye 'nudt so gudt!'

Also... I've been using a leather conditioner product called Autoglym 
from across the pond. By appointment to Her Majesty the Queen, harumph, 
tally ho, Phillip and I...
Seemed okay at first, but then I noticed a dry white residue forming in 
some of the cracks... not the Queen's... my car seats.

Just picked up some Lexol cleaner and conditioner, in L.A. [not 
available in Vancouver] What a difference!
