Guys (too numerous to mention!),

Thanks for all the helpful info!  I guess I've been a bad boy,
as the engine has been sitting on the dolly, resting on the
heat exchangers since I bought it about a year ago.  I guess
a couple days longer isn't going to hurt now.... =8^/  The heat
really seemed to do the trick.  For those at home, remember to
clean off any Liquid Wrench you may have previously applied...=8^0
Oh, and when at Home Depot with the s.o., just go straight over
and pick up the portable oxy/act torch, and don't mention that all
you really need is the little Benzo-matic unit; they just don't
understand the need for the extra firepower.

I got most of the nuts out over the weekend.  There is still one
that I don't quite have access to, but I will try to finagle
something tonight.  So far (knock on wood), I have not broken
any studs, although some of the nuts came out with the stud attached!
Also the 3 other remaining fasteners appear to be 8mm allen bolts
(Sears, here I come); I assume the studs broke sometime in the
past.  When I go and install the new headers, is there any reason
for me to replace all the old studs (what's the best way to remove?),
or should I just leave them and re-use them?  I'll definitely be
getting new copper nuts and a bunch of copper anti-seize.

I will go ahead and build a cradle to rest the engine cases on.
Seems to be pretty narrow (a lot of overhang from the cylinders
and heads), but oh well....  I appreciate the comments re: engine
stands.  I will eventually buy one, and Costco has this really
tempting cherry picker, but there's no room in the garage for
now.....

I figure now is a good time to go ahead and wash/degrease the engine,
since everything is pretty accessible.  Are there any do/don'ts to
doing this sort of thing while the engine is out.  The engine most
likely won't be put into the car for another 4-5 months (maybe longer
at the rate I'm working); perhaps I should wait until closer to
install time?

Bob, I'm dying to hear what that Bursch will sound like!

Thanks again, all,
Mike
