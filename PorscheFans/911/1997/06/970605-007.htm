I posted this request a few days ago, but must have hit one of the days that
Porschefans
was having a hissy fit and never saw the posting, so I'll try again.  Sorry
if you've already
seen this.

I am looking for a 911 SC in the $12,000 to $13,000 or less price range.  I
would prefer a
1980 or later coupe with a sunroof, but will consider a targa or a 78 or 79
if the price and
condition is right.  Must have NO RUST.  This means no rust ever.  No "rust
repaired"
cars.  No accidents, (beyond a minor fender bender that has been properly
repaired).
Prefer original paint, or a repaint that had the trim removed for paint
prep.  I've seen too
many cars with tape marks and overspray on the door handles and window trim,
and will
not consider those.  If repainted, it must be the original color.  (No red
cars that used to be
green)

I would also prefer Fuchs wheels and leather interior.  Color is not too
important but
really don't want that chocolate brown color.  The dark metallic brown
(mocha black?)
would be fine.

Prefer original engine and transmission if in good condition.  If rebuilt,
it should be done
by a reputable shop that has experience in Porsche rebuilds.  No amateur
jobs.  I would
like to see the receipts if available.

I  am from Wisconsin, and will travel to find the right car, but will not
appreciate any
tired, project cars passed off as "cream puffs".  Been there, done that,
won't do it again.
Sorry if this sounds picky, but I only have a limited amount of vacation to
spend on car
shopping trips, and would like to find a car before the summer is over.  I
am NOT a
broker.  This would be my own car for summer use only.

If you have a car that might fit this description, respond by E-mail to
Chuck at:
carrera@execpc.com

Send pictures if you have them.  I can view most electronic formats or
e-mail for my
address.  Thanks for listening.  I have been without a Porsche for almost a
year, and I'm
getting a little cranky.  The weather is getting nice and I'm still driving
my Subaru to
PCA events.

Chuck
