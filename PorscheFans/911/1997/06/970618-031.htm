Can't comment directly on using a trailer behind a 911, but I did see a
Corvette pulling a little box trailer for tires to an autocross. The
trailer had a box that was about 4 by 5 feet by 2.5 feet high with a
hinged, locking lid and all aluminum. No idea who made it though.

I just put my track tires on at home and drive on them to the track. I
figure that they get a lot more punishment on the track than they do on
the drive to and from and it doesn't seem to have affected their wear
rate.
