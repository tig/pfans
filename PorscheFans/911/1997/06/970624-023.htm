FWIW:

I have SSI's and a stock 73 muffler which has been "debaffled".  There
is what I would describe as a resonance between 2-3krpm, but contrary
to Eric's experience, this is one of my favorite sounds!  It is not
too loud or annoying, it just sounds better IMHO.  The sound is kind
of neutral from 3-4k but from 4k and up, LOOK OUT!  Serious sound
of urgently climbing rpms looking for the limiter.  It takes a lot of
self-contol to upshift and not just cruise a long at 4k + just to listen
to the wail :)

THe good thing about the resonance from 2-3krpm is that it encourages
me to cruise there in 5th gear which in some cases is a legal speed on
the freeway :)

Incidently, this debaffled muffler sounds stock at idle (except when
cold where it sits at 2k in "neighbor annoyance mode" in the morning).

Vol

Seen last week at an intersection:  Very Yellow 97 911 TT *Convertible*
with enormous aftermarket crome wheels and VERY LOUD muffler.
Almost sounded like a V8 when it launched.
