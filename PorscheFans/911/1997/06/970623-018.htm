I've got a 3rd generation (circa '90?) Sony 10-CD changer in the front boot of my 911 that is beginning to skip more than usual (and I'm looking into modifying my suspension for the track).  I've looked into getting a new changer, but my head unit is no longer compatible with the new changers.  Question is, is anyone aware of some creative ways to dampen the mount for a changer?  Are aftermarket dampening mounts available?  Can Sony rebuild an old unit with new dampening technology.  I thought of stretching some thick bunjee cords between the shock towers and attaching the changer, but I have a Cambermeister installed.  If you don't have a dampening idea, perhaps you can recommend a new unit.  Who sells changers with the electronic 3-10 second shock control?  Any ideas would be appreciated.

P.S. Politically incorrect joke:  Why did the cops take the 911 emergency number off the back of their cars?  The Mexicans kept stealing them thinking they were Porsches.
