Hi

I've experienced tracking every time I switched from my street GS-Cs to
my track A008RSIIs, I hear that BFG R1s are worse.

 Many  low profile high performance tires track (tramline, pull,
whatever) much more than other tires,that's mostly because of the stiff
sidewalls. Wider tires will also track more as I found out when I went
to 245-45s. 

As for the pressures, it depends on if Pirelli's answer was taking into
account that you changed widths. Looks like a trip to the skidpad is in
order.
