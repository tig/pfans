>>The drivers seat of my 1989 Carrera Cabriolet  has faded on one side after
only 35K miles.  Would like to redye the navy >>blue leather, but wonder if
I'll do more harm than good.  I've seen one Porsche site that describes the
process, but wonder if >>there's experience or advice from the list.  Can I
do just the faded spot, or is the whole seat best?

I had some fading on my seats (Brown) in an 82 91.  Since I figured leather
is pretty much leather I grabbed some shoe leather dye from the store and
went over the back of the seats to make sure I had a pretty good match and
it was pretty darn close so I did the rest of the seats and any other area
that seemed faded or nicked.  The I'm very happy with the outcome, though I
was a bit worried that if I didn't let the seats dry long enough I'd end up
with leather dye on my pants...happily this wasn't the case.  I did this
back in December and it's still looks great.

Seemed more frugal to do it this way.

Eric
