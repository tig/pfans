We owned a '68 911 Targa for six years. Here are some thoughts in response
to your questions.

1) Rust, yes, but look in all the odd places. The deal-killer is if there is
rust in the rear torque tube, the structure that holds the two rear torsion
bars and provides a basis for alignment of the rear suspension. Tough to get
at to inspect, but do it.

2) Find out as much as you can about prior engine work. Old chain tensioners
were frequently replaced with mechanically-adjusted units. if tightened too
much, these could stretch the valve timing chain and eventually cause it to
jump out of time. Result: much noise and bent valves if you're lucky, a
complete engine wipe-out if you're not. I was lucky; a friend with a '72
911T wasn't.

3) Heater boxes. They all rust, fast. Find out how rusty yours are, and plan
on replacing them soon.

4) Pricing: The latest issue of Excellence magazine has a Porsche market
article on early 911s. They list an estimate of about $7,500 for a car in
good street condition.

5) Buy it! The early 911s have a light sports car feel, an immediacy of
response, and an engine note that can't be duplicated in today's world.
Sure, they can bite you in the *** faster enough to make your head (and the
car) spin, but concentration and PCA driver's education programs can teach
you to know, understand and use those characteristics to your advantage and
pleasure.

Good luck with it!
