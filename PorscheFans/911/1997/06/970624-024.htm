Sorry for the reply all, but I've seen a few others with this problem as
well, so maybe this will help clear up a few things.

Personally, I've never had to re-subscribe.  The mailing list server
(porschefans.com) is designed to remove you from the mailing list if it ever
encounters an error while delivering mail to you - this is so it can detect
users who do not exist anymore and remove them from the list.  Your problem
is most likely one of the following four things...

1) You are subscribing to the mailing list with a bad return address
configured in your mail client (the list server uses your return address to
subscribe you)

2) You have changed your email address or have posted to the group using a
bad return address.

3) Your ISP's mail server is rejecting the incoming mail (maybe your mail box
is full or the server is down a lot).  This will cause you to get dropped
from the list when you post or anyone else posts.

4) Maybe PorscheFans has a bug in their mail server.
