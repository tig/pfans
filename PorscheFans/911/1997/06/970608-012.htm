       I own a '66 912 and recently sent my generator off to be rebuilt
after it was determined that the armature had failed.  The generator I
sent off was the type as desribed in the 912 Handbook with two external
terminals.  The one I received was marked GR26X on the box, which is
what I expected it to be identified as.  However, the one in the box was
not the same as the one I had sent.  It was the same diameter, but it
had the voltage regulator mounted on top of the generator.  It will only
fit between the oil filter and the oil tank with the regulator at the 12
o'clock position.  The problem is that the fan shroud holes will not
match up with the fan cover.  If the gererator is rotated left, the
mounting screw for the voltage regulator hit the genertor stand.  If the
generator is rotated right, the voltage regulator (B+ terminal) hits the
oil tank.  The numbers off of the replacement generator are as follows:

0104242006/005
7V45A27
111903021

    I can remove the voltage regulator and use my firewall mounted
regulator, but I would be joining wires (DF and D+) with the wires
coming from within the generator, without rigid mount (no terminal
posts).  I'm not comfortable with that--I would rather bolt, screw, or
somehow fasten.  Can anybody identify the generator that was sent to
me?  Is there anyway to rotate the internals of the generator so that I
can rotate the fan cover without rotating the generator casing?  Anybody
run across this problem and found a solution that didn't require
re-machining, cutting, or otherwise altering shroud/generator/voltage
regulator?  Should I contact the source of the generator for a more
original-style generator (if it's even available)?

Thanks for any input.
