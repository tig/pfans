If the seller knew that the advertised vehicle was a 911T and advertised it
as an S then he could be subject to a fraud suit or at the least a breach
of contract suit.  I  practice only personal injury law in the southern
part of Indiana and never get to Marion County (Indianapolis) so I am out
of my element  (It is also 3:30 a.m.) but I will offer a few observations. 


You may want to contact your local postal authorities and see if you have
any remedies via the mail fraud theory.  His story sounds pretty
unsupportable, coupled with the experience that the local porsche person
who warned him of such a situation if he continued to hold the car out as
an S.  Perhaps a letter from them may cause him enough discomfort to pay
up.  This avenue of attack would be cheap but I don't know if the postal
inspector would feel it appropriate to take up your case.

You may also write to Hemmings.  They apparently have a complaint office
and according to their latest issue where they list the number and types of
complaints and the percentage resolved they apparently take steps to assist
customers in resolving complaints like these.  Look in the latest Hemmings
for information about this.

As a former deputy prosecutor I doubt if the local office will do much. 
They will likely consider your matter as a civil matter  (I could be
surprised).  If you want to pursue this I would suggest that you contact an
Indianapolis police official to file a formal complaint under appropriate
criminal laws(and let the seller know that you are doing this). Then a
letter to the Marion County prosecutor should be written to follow up.  I
am not familiar enough with the state of criminal law in Indiana to know
whether there is a criminal statute to address your particular problem as I
have not practiced in the criminal area for a number of years.

Another possible course of action is to contact the Attorney General's
office to see if it deals with cases of individual consurmer fraud.  A
letter from them to the seller saying that they are investigating may
provide enough pressure for him to send you the money.

All of the above possible remedies should cause no out of pocket expenses
other than phone calls.

On the promissory note that you had him sign.  Does it call for attorneys
fees, interest, and a due date?  If so, you could also sue on the note. 
The problem is that you are so far away from Indiana that it is impractical
to come to Indiana to pursue a case that may or may not be collectible even
though you may win a judgment.  In any even you may consider contacting  an
Indianapolis attorney to write the individual a letter just to let him know
that you are serious about getting the money.

You do have an option of going througn small claims court without a lawyer
but the experience will likely be very frustrating.

As a last resort you could hire a lawyer and make a contingent fee
agreement with him or her whereby the lawyer would be paid only if he or
she would be successful in obtaining your funds.  The fee would be a
percentage of the amount collected.  He or she would want you to advance
court costs to pursue the case.  You should be present at the hearing to
tell the judge about what happened.  The porsche person who spoke with the
seller before your contact ideally should be called as a witness.  You
should also have the Hemming's ad to show the judge along with the note and
the cancelled check.

You could also hire a lawyer on a straight hourly basis but his or her fees
would need to be paid whether of not you are successful.

If enough pressure is placed on the seller he may consent to lien on the
title of the car and then at leat you would have some security in the event
the car is sold.  You would want a lawyer to make sure this lien is
perfected properly.
