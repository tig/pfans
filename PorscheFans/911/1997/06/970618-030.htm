I just put SSIs on my car. There are two oil lines. I don't have the
numbers handy, but they sound exactly as you describe.

The SSIs came with a weirdly shaped 13mm box end wrench. It is U shaped
so you can fit it around the heat exchangers. I bet some of the mail
order catalog companies carry this wrench.

Good Luck!
