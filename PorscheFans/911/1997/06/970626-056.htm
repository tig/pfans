My car was lowered to Euro spec. It has the front chin spoiler on it and
even at this height I have to be careful when leaving driveways or I
will scrape the spoiler.

There are a couple of problems that arise if you lower it much more.
One, you will get bump steer (fixable with rack spacers which are not
needed at the Euro height). Second, you will be scraping the road that
much more. Driveways and parking lot speed bumps will be your nemesis.
And thirdly, you decrease the effectiveness of your shocks because you
have shortened their travel.

If you really want to radically lower your car, use the factory RSR
struts and matching Bilstien shocks. The spindle is moved up on the
strut which lowers the car without shortening the suspension travel. The
rear shocks are designed for the shorter travel. This is the way to go
if money is no object (the whole setup is over $4K for the parts).
