Looking for help!
The brake light on my dash, the one that comes on when the parking brake
is on, is now on all the time.  When I put the parking brake up and down
it does dim very slightly so I don't think is the switch at the parking
brake.  
The brakes work fine, stops well, firm pedel. The car doesn't pull to
either side when braking hard. In the owners manual it states that if a
brake circut fails the light will come on when you push on the brakes,
so I don't think its the hydralics. As it is on all the time.  But could
be the switch that checks this. 

My question is where is the switch to check? What else should I check?
What could cause this?

Thanks,
