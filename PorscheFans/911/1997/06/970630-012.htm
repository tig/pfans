  I too have a new 993 that I purchased on April 21st.  It currently has 1955
miles on it.  So far, I've only had to add 1/2 a quart of oil.  I was warned
about probably having to add 1 quart per 1000 to 2000 miles during the first
10,000 miles but so far I've been checking every week with nothing needed.  I
have NOT seen ANY oil shaving bits on my dipstick.   I would be in a complete
panic if I did.  I will now double check at luchtime to see if my dipstick is
made of that compressed metal and/or has any 'shavings' on it.

  BTW: My 993 Carrera was a left over 96 that was not yet bought.  It had 42
miles on it when I purchased it in April.  I am wondering if you folks
reporting problems all have the 97 993.  Did Porsche maybe change 'dip sticks'
or other components in the '97 models?  AND, has anyone else only had to add
1/2 a quart of oil within the first 1900 miles?  Is this o.k. or is something
wrong here.. Most of the trips have been small ones with the exception of one
600 mile trip and one 250 mile trip.

Thanks in advance,   Chris  Boyd.C@grainger.com
