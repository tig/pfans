---------------------------------------

I was talking with Robert Wood (himself) about this last week.

The Factory (and PCNA, expecially) has overstated the 'dangers' of going to
18s on many chassis. They have flatly stated some wheels do not fit, when
they clearly do. A cynic might say their motivation is that they want you
to give your money to them, not to somebody else.

However, it's important to understand that in this era (and country) of
litigiousness and dumb-as-dirt juries, Porsche is just being prudent.

If you want the straight poop, call Wheel Enhancement. Either Robert or
John can give you an independent answer.
