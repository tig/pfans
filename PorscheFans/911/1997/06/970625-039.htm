I wouldn't do it. Brakes are one place where I wouldn't want to cut
corners. Do you think the factory cast an extra mm in those places just
to be generous? I doubt it.  Did they say to mill it in such a way as to
leave radiused corners? If you cut out a nicely cast/forged fillet
corner with a square mill you end up with a sharp corner which would
generate stress risers. This sounds like a formula for disaster.
