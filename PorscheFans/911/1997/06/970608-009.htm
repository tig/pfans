A long time lurker, first time poster is seeking guidance
on purchasing (and building) the car of his dreams.  Since
I was ten years old, I have read and dreamed of driving a
911 Turbo Cab.  I understand that 89 was the last year they
made the car, but I would be willing to buy a later model
and add horsepower to it.

My specs are pretty simple so far : 911, Cabriolet, White
exterior, Tan top and interior.  Oh, and it has to be fast.
(Not top-speed fast, just fast on corners and short straights)
The year is relatively unimportant to me, as I will be
bolting on the additions I want as I can afford them.

I want the car to be fast, but if I get beat by a Twin Turbo,
I won't get my feelings hurt.  I realize the cab increases my
coefficient of drag and reduces speed.  I have talked to
Protomotive and they say they can boost it up to 800HP (with
the G50 transmission) but I don't think I need anywhere near
that kind of power.

I want the car to have hips as wide as my first girlfriend.
If the car doesn't have the turbo-wide-body I would consider
adding one (I might do the work myself - except painting - or
I might hire it out).

I love to drive, and I love to drive hard.  I would love to
do some autocrossing just for fun (for now, maybe serious later).
I drove a C4S and fell in love with it, but dream car has always
been the cab (maybe even a slantnose!) and I am willing to forgo
AWD (if necessary) in order to have the convertible.

My questions are :
1) Am I crazy ?
2) What should I look for/avoid in certain year models ?
3) How realistic is it to have huge horsepower in a ragtop ?
4) What are the experiences with protomotive as far as reliability ?
5) How well do cabs perform in autocross (or would I look like a nut?)

I attended the autocrosses at the IKEA parking lot just outside
the Philly area for a while, but never raced (had several
friends who did).  There were some convertibles running there,
but no Porsches.  How competive would this dream car be ?

Thanks for any opinions,

James Shoffit
