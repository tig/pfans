Hi Ezra Goldman - on 17 Jun 97, talking about "Summary: Sources for Porsche 
books", you said:

> Here's a list of sources for Porsche and racing related books and
> manuals. Thanks to all who contributed. -Ez Goldman

The following is something I originally posted to PorscheFans about a year
ago and which may be of interest to newcomers; it relates to car-related
bookshops on the UK side of the pond.


The two best that I know of are:

Chater's
8 South Street
Isleworth
Middlesex
England TW7 7BG
Tel: +44 181 568 9750
Fax: +44 181 569 8273

(This is just outside London but is a *pig* to get to by public transport.
Take a tube to Hounslow East on the Piccadilly Line and then a H37 bus to
South Street from Hounslow Bus Garage. They do overseas mail order and
take all major credit cards.)

Motor Books International

(can't find address details :-( but it's just off Charing Cross Road in
London)

There is also the world's most chaotic large bookshop, Foyles. If you can
manage to find the car section, you'll be amazed at the sheer number of
books which you just don't see anywhere else. The downside is that some of
them have been on the shelves for so long that they are quite dog-eared.

Foyles
Charing Cross Road
London
WC1

(Right bang in the centre of London. Nearest tube is either Tottenham
Court Road or Leicester Square, I think)

Others automobile bookshops I have brochures from include:

Mill House Books
The Mill House
Eastville
Boston
Lincolnshire
England PE22 8LS
Tel: +44 1205 270377
Fax: +44 1205 270551

Bookspeed
10 Barley Mow Passage
Chiswick
London
England W4 4PH
Tel: +44 181 994 7054
Fax: +44 181 995 2624
e-mail: bookspeed@bookspeed.win-uk.net
WWW: http://www.bookspeed.co.uk/cars/

(I think there is some tie-in between Bookspeed and 911 & Porsche World
magazine)

Albion Scott Ltd./Connoisseur Carbooks
51 York Road
Brentford
Middlesex
England
TW8 0QP
Tel: +44 181 560 3404
Fax: +44 181 560 0595

(they also have shops in London, Leeds, New York, Frankfurt, Antwerp,
Brussels, Helsinki and Johannesburg)

Brooklands Books Ltd
P O Box 146
Cobham
Surrey
KT11 1LG
Tel: +44 1932 865051
Fax: +44 1932 868803

(Brooklands are publishers, but they sell direct to the public. They have
a hugh range of road test books, each containing about 100 pages of road
tests from magazines - there are about 8 or 10 covering the 911 alone. They
also do 356 and 912 workshop manuals.)

As far as I know, all the above produce catalogues, ship worldwide, and
will take credit cards.

The Automobile Club in Milan (Italy) has the most *amazing* selection of
car books I have ever seen. I counted over 100 different Porsche books in
a variety of languages, but I don't have the address :-(
