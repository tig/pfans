Brad -

I just had the windshield on my '89 C4 replaced via Allstate insurance, who 
referred me to Windshields America, who's receipt says Vistar. The work was 
actually done by a local auto-glass shop, go figure.

My 911 has no marking aside from an A->S (I think) on the driver side edge 
center. I don't think it was replaced before. Tint is minimal. All other 
glass is Sekurit.

Make sure the glass shop knows to replace the gasket. When the repair van 
showed up at my house, he did some prying, then mentioned he did not have a 
replacement gasket. He left, ordered the gasked via the local P dealer. The 
next week, I brought the car to the shop, and he replaced glass and all. 
They even managed to replace my rearview mirror, inspection sticker and 
registration. All in all, the work was good.

From: bjanesi@juno.com (Bradley J. Anesi)

My windshield is scheduled to be replaced next Tuesday, due to it's
second bullseye, in as many years - this one is too big to fix, and it's
right in the line of sight.

State Farm has arranged for "Vistar" to do the replacement - when I spoke
with them today, they knew enough to ask if it had an antennea built in,
but not much more.  The brand of replacement glass is Sigla (sp?), which
they claimed is factory original.   I'm pretty sure this is incorrect, as
all the other windows have the "Sekurit" logo on them.  Oddly enough,
only the front window doesn't have this logo - maybe the previous owner
replaced the original?

Anyway, here's my questions, directed primarily at '84 -'89 owners...
1) Does your 911 have any manufactuer markings on the front windshield?
2) Are all '84 - '89 windshields tinted at the top?  (Mine is)
3) I presume it's standard procedure to replace the gasket, yes?
4) Anything else I should be asking?

Thanks,
