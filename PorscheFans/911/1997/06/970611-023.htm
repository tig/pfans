I'm a newer 911 owner with some basic questions, 
and am almost embarrassed to ask, since they're 
somewhat pedestrian compared to the general content 
of the list.  But here goes.

1.  The drivers seat of my 1989 Carrera Cabriolet 
has faded on one side after only 35K miles.  Would 
like to redye the navy blue leather, but wonder if 
I'll do more harm than good.  I've seen one Porsche 
site that describes the process, but wonder if 
there's experience or advice from the list.  Can I 
do just the faded spot, or is the whole seat best?
2.  At the 30K service, Castrol GTX 20/50 turbo was 
used, but now I'd like to switch to synthetic.  
Some of the oil sites suggest cleansing the engine 
first with a lightweight oil, before converting, so 
all the gunk is removed.  Has anyone had any horror 
stories of clogged oil passages or other problems 
on a car with my mileage when synthetic was used 
after a normal oil change, or do I need to get the 
engine ready?    And by the way, the engine doesn't 
drip today, at all.  Some said synthetic is more 
likely to leak.  True??   All considered 
however, seems like the benefits of synthetic make 
it the clear choice.

3.  I removed my whaletail, and now need to have 
the mounting holes welded in and deck lid 
repainted.  Instead of paying the prices quoted by 
local shops, I wonder if anyone knows where I could 
find a pristine silver metallic lid that would bolt 
in to my 89 Cab?  Don't need the light and grill, 
just the lid.

Thanks in advance,  Bill
.
