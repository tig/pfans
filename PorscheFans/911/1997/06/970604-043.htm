Turns out the A/C project has been put off a bit as the blown up
transmission has gotten all of my attention of late. In terms of where
the thought process is at this point, current pieces which seem to make
sense are:

1. Use the standard 911 A/C compressor mount, either aluminum or steel
with a Sanden 505 or 508 compressor. This is the normal rotary
compressor which is used to replace the York lawnmower type. Teh 505 is
a bit smaller in capacity (5 cu inch) but also lighter. I am hoping with
a large enough condenser that it will be a reasonably effective
compromise between cooling and power consumption.

2. Use normal (e.g. North American spec) A/C lines along the driver
side, much the same as the passenger side has the oil lines. I am
looking at using copper or aluminum lines rather than flexible hoses,
mainly as they are likely more reliable considering the exposed
locations and not too hard to bend. In going through the rear inner
fender wall I was planning on using a part from Vintage Air which has a
nice little bulkhead part.
Naturally the hard lines are compatible with R12 and R134a, but if I end
up with hoses then there is a need to use the appropriate R134a hose
with the barrier in it.

3. Vintage Air also has a selection of reciever/dryers, one I have had
in mind is the one with the replaceable drying element.

4. I was planning on using just one condenser, mounted in the front
location normally used for oil coolers (e.g. with the Ruf front
spoiler). Turns out that there are a number of commercially available
condensers which are on the order of 25 x 8 x 3 inches which ought to
have the right kind of volumes for cooling, coupled with two electric
fans for those times when the air flow isn't sufficient. The particular
one I looked at is from a Mack truck....only problem is that they want
me to buy a CB radio and a copy of Smokey and the Bandit :-). :-)

5. Evaporator is where the fun begins, I really can't stand the stock
set up with dual sets of air flow systems, seems like a clumsy way to do
things. I have a spare ventilation fan and have been looking to whether
I can place an evaporator coil between the intake (the one that connects
to the grille under the windshield) and the fan unit you see with the
trunk open. Turns out that they separate and I can't yet see a reason
why an insert could not be fabricated which would hold an evaporator and
the expansion valve. Some engineering required here, but it looks
possible at this point. Advantages would be that all the vents would
work for fresh or chilled air, depending on whether A/C was on or off. 

As for the R 134a side of things, all the parts I have mentioned here
are available in R 134a compatible form....Vintage Air has been a good
source of information to this point.

Timing for this affair is likely winter as the transmission is still
awaiting a couple of parts......
