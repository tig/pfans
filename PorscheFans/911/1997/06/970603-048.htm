Congratulations.

I got my C2S in May.

It's my 9th 911 and my 22nd Porsche.

You are either going to have your one and only experience with expensive
sports car ownership or you  will begin a long period in which you have at
least one porsche in the household.

Much depends upon your vigilance.

New-to-Porsche people sometimes forget that other folks resent that you
have what they wish they had--and what they feel they can never attain.
Consequently, be aware of where you are and who is around you constantly. I
have had five acquaintances lose their Porsches at gunpoint.

Be aware also of the appropriateness of the places you go with your
Porsche. In environments where everyone is likely to feel they can never
own one, you risk 'envy scratches'. Especially if you appropriate 2 parking
spaces.

No one has ever stolen one of my Porsches nor keyed one. But I did have a
couple of attempted (amateur) breakins.

Expect that the effect of driving alongside people on arterials or freeways
will cause them to drive in more aggressive fashion--cutting you off,
weaving toward you, etc. They do this because it often produces the desired
result: a sudden demonstration of spectacular acceleration.

Do Not 'valet' your car if you can possibly avoid it. Valets feel that if
you can afford this car, you can afford to lose some stuff out of it. They
also fail to clear driveways and other obstacles with some regularity. When
you get your car back do a walk-around to check the front valance for
scrapes and the sheetmetal for dings. On rare occasions the valet will go
for a ride to show his girlfriend the cool set of wheels he's driving.

Remember that valet parking services are usually independent contractors.
In most states, they are bonded, but that 'bond' may be just an insurance
policy. And you may negver collect a cent. Because your own insurance *will
not* cover your car when you voluntarily surender it to somebody else.

With these caveats, (which cost me well in excess of $35,000 to accumulate)
I'm sure you will have a great time. The 993 is the ultimate Porsche, IMHO.


If you wish to exploit its full potential, invest in a performancee driving
course or join your local Porsche club and go to a driver training event or
two.

Have fun!
