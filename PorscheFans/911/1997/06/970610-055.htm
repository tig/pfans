Michael, don't get too excited about the lack of Massachusetts emissions =
testing on cars over 15 years old.  There is a revision coming.

Massachusetts is supposed to implement their own version of IM240 dyno =
emissions testing.  I was recently talking to one of the state =
regulators about this.  The current proposal is to subject all cars back =
to 1981 to this testing.  Only actual emissions will be regulated.  =
There will not be an equipment check.  He told me he had no desire to =
get into the mechanics.  If the car passes emissions, he basically =
doesn't care how it's done.

This bill was approved by the Weld administration, and had gone to the =
Legislature.  However, they wanted the testing done annually instead of =
the recommended biannually (can't give up any of that revenue!), and had =
sent it back to the governor.  With Weld being nominated to be the next =
Mexican ambassador, there is some question when the bill will be sent =
back to the Legislature.

Who knows when this will actually take effect.  Probably a trial run in =
1998, and full implementation in 1999 at the earliest.  One big hurdle I =
see is that the state will not operate the testing stations.  They =
expect the current crop of private inspection stations to buy the dyno =
equipment.  I don't see them doing that too readily.

Good luck, and welcome to Massachusetts.
