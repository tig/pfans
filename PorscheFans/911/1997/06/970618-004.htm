Steve,

I posted this same question a while back.  Ensure that you get the OE
return tubes with the green Viton seals.  They can be purchased from
Automotion; compare prices with the factory return tubes at the dealer they
maybe very close or even cheaper.

I still have the factory straight tubes and found that since I'm driving
the car more now (and have had some track time)  The car isn't leaking
anymore.  I store the 911 for about 6 months up here in Canada when it gets
really cold and the tubes tend to weep oil.

As far as the installation is concerned, I've heard it's really easy. 
Crush and remove them all.  The driver's side front tube may be a little
tricky since it is covered mostly by the heat exchanger.  I've heard of
successful re/re with the tubes w/o removing the exchangers (after all that
is what the collapsible units are for and so you don't have to disassemble
the heads).  Apparently for the tricky front one, you have to insert the
tube and press it in with a screwdriver from what others have said on the
list before, but the point of the matter is that it can be done.

Joe
