I've been asked about the kill switch I installed in my car by a number of
people through private mail, so instead of witing individually to all of
them I'm sending a copy of the message I sent to Yasha Kresh a few days
ago. Hope it helps.

The one I have is actually similar to that: it interrupts the on signal to
the DME (straight from the switch) and also the fuel pump (branching off of
the fuse box). All the wiring is taped and arranged in such a way as to
look "factory-installed". Because of the circuit and relay used, even if
they figured out the wires were not standard and tried to bridge the
connections, it would still not work. They would have to thoroughly
understand how the system worked before they could bypass it all. It would
go beyond the scope of knowledge of the typical joyrider.

Unfortunately I don't have any schematics (I didn't do it myself), but the
system uses a very simple circuit connected to a relay, so that when you
engage the key there's current in the switch, but none in the fuel pump or
the DME. Pressing the switch closes the relay and feeds those two things
with power. The relay remains closed while the key is not moved. Whenever
that happens the relay opens and you have to turn the key and press the
switch again, or the engine will not start. The system works very well. If
you want you can leave the switch on all the time (if you are in a safe
neighborhood, or leave the car at the mechanic's, for example). The switch
can be any type you want, going from a rocker switch (not recommended) to a
toggle that can be the cigarette lighter or a magnetic one in the dashboard
somewhere or behind the door panel, for example. I installed mine in the
lighter. For maximum security I can take the lighter with me.

If you would like I can put you in contact with the guy that did the job
for me here in San Diego. He works for a high end car audio installation
place, but did the kill switch for me on the side, therefore saving me a
considerable amount of money. I suppose he can prepare the whole thing for
you (relay, circuit, wiring, etc.) and ship it to you. I'm sure you could
install it yourself, or have an alarm installer do it for you.
