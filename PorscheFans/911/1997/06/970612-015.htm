Greetings P-people (or is it P-ple?):

Well, I just came back from a really fun three days running the '97 993 at 
Laguna Seca.  Compared to my Nissan track car, the P-car was really born 
for the track, even though I ran it bone-stock.  Now here's the question 
for all you superior P-beings out there:

In two of the run sessions on the last day, accelerating out of Turns 4, 5, 
and 6, I distinctly heard a couple of "pop-pop" noise from the back of the 
car.  Each time this happened it only popped twice, with no loss of power 
or hesitation.  Trying to describe noise in writing is like describing a 
new color, but it sounded most like a muted backfire, like backfiring at 
about ten percent of the decibel.  I should know, because the '64 Cobra in 
front of me was "truly" backfiring almost every time he lifted.  Mine had 
the same sound, only not as loud, and it only happened when I was flat on 
the gas (about 5000 rpm).

As far as I know, backfiring only happens when one lifts, so I don't think 
that was my problem (and the noise volume was lower than real backfiring, 
too).  I do think, however, that it had something to do with the gas I was 
using, since that was the only change I made in the three days at the 
track.  Here are some other facts about this case:

Day one.  Six runs.  For first four runs I used up the remaining gas in the 
tank from when I drove to the track.  Gas was Chevron 92 pump octane.  For 
the last two runs I had mixed 5 gallons of race gas sold at the track (110 
pump octane) and 5 gallons of Chevron 92, also sold at track.  No popping 
noise.  (Guy who sold the race gas recommended 50-50 mix.)

Day two.  Six runs.  First four runs used up previous day's mix.  No noise. 
 Before last two runs filled with 7 gallons race gas (110 octane).  The 
Chevron guy was gone so no mix today, all race gas last two runs.  Still no 
noise.

Day three.  Six runs.  On the way to track I got 7 gallons of Shell 92, so 
now I have some mix of race gas from previous day plus Shell 92 gas today, 
not 50-50 mix.  On third and fourth runs I hear the popping noise.  Then 
I'm almost on empty again, so got gas for last two runs (and drive home). 
 Race gas guy is out, so I get 10 gallons of Chevron 92.  Last two runs no 
noise.  Drive home no noise (even though I didn't accelerate at 5000 rpm on 
the way home!)

I'm thinking that either the Shell gas was "bad" gas, and caused the 
popping noise, or else I confused my knock sensor by varying the gas mixes 
over the three days, so it let some mild detonation occur?  I've never 
heard detonation before, so no previous experience to compare, but I always 
thought detonation would sound like pings or knocks, not pops?  If indeed I 
suffered mild (or regular strength) detonation, what should I look for now 
as evidence of that?  Any potential long term effects?

Oh, and one last fact:  First time I tracked the car, at Thunderhill four 
weeks prior, I used exclusively street gas, and no popping noise.  No noise 
before or since Laguna Seca either.

TIA,
Bob
