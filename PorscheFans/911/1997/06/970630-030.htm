Carl--
My recommendation is to have a good tire service remove the tire and do
a real patch from the inside. I had a plug in the right rear tire of my
'89 944 which I did not know about when I bought the car, because it was
on the inside of the tire. It failed at about 65mph on a curvy Colorado
mountain road. That took the best of my driving ability to keep the car
under control and come to a safe stop. Earlier that day I had been
driving much faster, and a failure then would probably have been
disastrous. Buy new tires if you can afford them; remove the tire and
patch from the inside if not. Don't trust the plugs unless you plan to
drive at very low speeds.
