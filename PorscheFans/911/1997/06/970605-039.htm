We've had some wet weather here recently (this is Seattle, so that's a
joke, ok?) and several times I've noticed severe fogging on the inside
glass of my oil gauge (the one with the oil temp & pressure gauges).  Is
this common. If not, is there an easy/obvious fix?

While I'm on the subject of oil, I guess I just don't understand how the
dry sump oil system works. My dash board has four gizmos for telling me
about my oil:

1.	The "Druck Press" oil pressure gauge. 
2.	The oil temperature gauge.
3.	The oil level warning light which never comes on (thank God). 
4.	The "Oil" gauge.

1-3 are obvious and I think I even know how to read them (although I
think I want to replace the "idiot" version of the temperature gauge
with one with real numbers on it).

But #4 is mysterious to me. It's always in the red when I'm driving and
sometimes when I'm stopped (particularly when the engine's cold).  What
is this things supposed to be telling me and what should I do when it
does tell me something?

Thanks in advance.
