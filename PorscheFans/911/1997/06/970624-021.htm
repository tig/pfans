Hi Steve,

>The toolkit includes the P208 tool and I can't figure out where it goes.

I don't know what the P208 tool is (the tool used to hold the fan pulley
when taking off the pulley not, perhaps), but the usual way one turns the
crank is to put a wrench on the fan pulley nut and turn it clockwise. If
the fanbelt slips when you do this, and it usually will, just push in on
the left side of the belt to help it get a grip.

I probably was the one who suggested this alternative way of turning
the engine over.  It's very easy this way.  Jack up one wheel, put it in
4th or 5th, and turn the wheel.

>but I'd rather use the timing marks and the distributor rotor.

I think you're missing the point.  In fact, I don't know what you're trying
to say.  You can't use the timing marks and distributor rotor to turn the
engine over. You use them to determine when a particular piston is  at top
dead center so you can adjust the valves for that cylinder.  If you use the
turn-the-wheel method to turn the engine over you can't easily turn the
wheel and simultaneously watch the timing marks, so you have to turn it a
bit, then look at the timing marks, turn a bit more, etc., until the marks
line up with the case.

When you adjust the timing or the valves, you have to turn the engine over
to get the crank pulley marks to line up with the split in the engine case,
indicating top-dead-center for each piston.  It makes no difference whether
you turn the engine over with a wrench on the fan pulley nut, or by turning
a wheel with the car in gear, or by getting a wrench right on the
crankshaft pulley nut (which you can do with the engine out of the car), or
by any other means you can think of.

Does this help?  Give me a call if you want.  206 543 1310 till 5 Pacific time.
