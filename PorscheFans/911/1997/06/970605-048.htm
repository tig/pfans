I always find the responses to this dilema interesting, since we are 
such a vastly varied lot, who share a similar passion and the foibles 
that accompany it.  Rich, not so rich, mechanical, not so mechanical, 
old, not so old, from Iowa, not from Iowa (just kidding!!!)etc. 
Here is my philosophy...
I own several computers, however, I am not a computer nut. I want them 
to go fast and not break down. When they do... I get annoyed and want 
them fixed, now! I have a guy with a small shop who builds and upgrades 
for me. He is not the cheapest or most expensive. And it took a few bad 
experiences before I found him. He stands by his work and gives me FREE 
ADVICE. If I only need a cheap fix... he does it that way. If it's 
expensive he is fair. If I am in a fix, he drops everything, and gets 
me back on track. 
In return I give him loyalty...
If I need a Zip drive etc, I know I can buy it cheaper from Future Shop, 
but I don't. If he simply can't compete he tells me, however, I always 
give him the option.

Works for me... and it's not Wallmart.

The truth is out there. Ain't competition great!

BTW. Anybody make an espresso machine for one of these damn cars?
