Subject: Clutch Adjustment ?

On my way home today my clutch - transmission started feeling "funny".
 It did
not want to down -shift to 2nd and really did not want to go into 1 
st. Double
clutching dosen't help and it's by Brute Force and Ignorance ? that I 
made it
home. 
Once in 1st - 2nd fine but then 5th is now ~ where 3rd was? Please 
let me
explain further... 2nd goes directly into 5th., or quite easily into 
5th i have
to come back and physically "look" for third. Before I call up my
mechanic/dealer could someone PLEASE share some insight ?
1.) Clutch adjustment ? 
It hasn't even suggested there was a problem so i doubt this fix.
2.) Tranny problems ?  
While this would probably be the most expensive it's where i'm 
thinking the
problem will show up  :^(
Nothing has been done to the car in the last few weeks to even think 
would
cause fault If i go out and depress clutch with car off running 
idling, rolling
it around the car does not want to go into 1st.   Any ideas I'm 
Perplexed at
this point....

Denny:
 I had a similar problem and it was the shift rod coupling. The 
bushings had broke making it impossible to shift. Just like yours! It 
can be found under the cover plate in the back floor board. $25 to 
$40. 
Good Luck
Scott
