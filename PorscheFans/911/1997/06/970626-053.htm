Hi Jerry.  I've done this in half a day - it's not so bad.  I didn't remove 
the calipers, however, some BRUTE force was required to free the slotted 
"nut" that holds the strut captive.  I bought a tool that had a pivoting 
hook (forget it's name) and a bar - this hook fits the notch, and you slip 
a three foot pipe over it!

Also, get ready for a big mess.  The struts are filled with 10+ year old 
super stinky oil that is mildly under pressure.  Kind of like tossing 
yourself into a large salad!

-Dave
