Subject: Idling Problems

Forgive me for eating bandwith with a repetitive question.
I know in my months of viewing the list, multiple people, multiple times
have posted symptoms similar to mine. Rather than spending days
reviewing the archives or finding an upfixin manual, I thought I
would take the "easy" route...  Please bear with...

84 Carrera 3.2 Stock, 80K, complete top-end rebuild 11K ago...

Problem:  The car has begun stalling whenever I lift off
off the accelerator.  It had occured intermittently while driving,
and when just puttering around (backing out of a garage, for example).
It doesn't spit and sputter, it just dies instantly.  Hit the key
and it starts right back up.  It had done this occasionally for
the last 3 months of driving, just often enough to raise curiosity, but
not concern.  Two nights ago, after driving for a while at full
temperature, it stalled 4 or 5 times in a row while I was putting
it away in the garage.  The next morning, it continued to exhibit the
same behavior cold when I was taking it out of the garage.  Again,
the problem was the same, whenever you have the throttle at any position
above idle and let it drop to idle by lifting off the accelerator,
it just dies.

In addition, when it was started the following morning cold,
the idle would bounce between 500 and 1500 in a one or two-second cycle,
as I have heard described many times on the list.

I am assuming it is a sensor of some sort.  Any help would be appreciated.

Matt,
It's your idle circuit. You can start by trying to adjust the idle . The
idle compession motor controls a valve in the line around the mass flow
valve on the intake to the engine. It tries to find a happy medium by
opening and closing the valve to add more air to the system to increase the
idle or to control the idle. If it can't control the mixture it cycles open
and close hunting. Thus the 500rpm to 1500rpm surges. 1.You can try to
adjust the idle and get rid of the problem, ( turn the idle screw in
quarter turn increments open to increase the idle speed, 2. Take the motor
out of the circuit (2 clamps on air hoses) and try cleaning it out with
carb cleaner.  3 Look and see if the motor is in the line with the air flow
the correct way. Sounds dumb, but if this happens it runs swell when warm
but not worth a darn when cold (it surges) 4 If your good you can carefully
take the motor apart and clean it.
 A new motor is about $150 -$180 if it's shot.
I took mine apart and cleaned the shafts  and cleaned the crud out of it
and it runs great no more surging or dieing when cold.
Best of luck.
