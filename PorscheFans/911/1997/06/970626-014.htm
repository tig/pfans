I went through the same debate. I wanted a Cab, but the added security of
the targa roof sounded good for trips and other times I have to park it
somewhere.
After looking at both, the deal came through on the Cab and I don't
regret it. I lock up minor stuff in the glovebox, including the removable
faceplate on my Blauplunkt. The rest goes up front and I lock the handle.
With creative packing, I'm surprised with how much I can fit up there,
including my golf clubs (once I got a smaller bag). The top is a little
time consuming, but I do like the manual top on mine vs the electric top.
It is quicker to take down/up. Not much of an issue because I leave mine
under cover in the garage with the top stowed.
