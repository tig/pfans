My previous experience with FM based CD changers was not great. There
were flat spots in the frequency response and my dash was cluttered with
2 sets of controls. On a 911 the sound issue is probably not gonna make
a heck of a lot of difference because you can't hear *any* stereo very
well anyway. :->.

I had to make choice similar to yours and decided to junk the Blaupunkt
and get a Kenwood CD player with a 10 disc Kenwood CD changer mounted in
the boot about where the antenna would be on an older 911.  I paid $310
for the CD player deck. If you just wanted a CD changer capable deck you
could probably get one for $100 less. The nice thing here is you have
just one set of controls.

I am currently toying with the notion of installing a 10-disk CD Changer

with an FM interface. The unit ties into the existing Blaupunkt Radio 
through the Antenna lead and converts the signal to a preset FM signal. 
Has anyone installed a similar unit and are you pleased with 
the performance, considering it is still at the mercy of the radio and 
speakers.
