There is a very good list of improvements to the 911 A/C system listed in PMP
at

	http://macmyler.engr.ucf.edu/Poor_Mans_Porsche.html#HDR6__2_15

I'm due for an A/C recharge on my '87 so the system will be evacuated and
presents an opportunity for some improvements.

Taking the points in the URL listed above one by one:

	The bulkhead vent -- is there really a dramatic improvement (just
	seems hard to believe since no incremental cooling capacity is
	being added)?  My stock bulkhead vent is definitely of the
	"constricted" variety with something on the order of a 1/4" hole.

	The rotary compressor -- the '87 comes with this already.

	Additional condensor -- I called Performance Aire in the LA area,
	and they have a large additional condensor available -- BUT because
	the G50 transmission (first introduced in '87) extends further
	forward, this condensor can't be added to '87 and on.  Are there
	other choices?

	Pro Cooler -- this one is listed last in this prioritized list
	although it is accompanied by the comment "Very significant
	difference."  Has anyone tried this?  (It is a more thermally
	efficient receiver/dryer and accumulator than stock.)

So for my car at least, it would seem that only the bulkhead vent and the Pro
Cooler are options for A/C improvement.  Is that correct?

Are there any additional things that could be considered at this time?

Thanks for any help,
