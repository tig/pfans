There are two schools of thought on repaints, the first being that if
the original paint is well adhered and there are no signs of rust
through, then a the old paint can be used as a base and means of
flattening out any waves (via the sanding process) which may be present
in the metal. Most good paints will adhere to pretty well any base,
there being a bit of worry if silicone was used but there are ways
around that. 

The second school of thought is that you want to see what the base metal
looks like and then build up a good base of known primers on which to
base your nifty top coat. You also avoid any risk of missing rust which
may be lurking underneath and losing detail by having too thick a coat
of paint.

My vote would be that if you *knew* there was just factory paint
underneath everything, I'd sand to the factory primer and then paint
away. If I was unsure I'd go right to the metal, even plastic blast if
needed.
