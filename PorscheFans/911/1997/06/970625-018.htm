I am looking at a 1971 911T Targa as a project car and need some advice
on what a good price would be.  I haven't driven the car yet, only
visually inspected it.  It appears to be in good (not great) shape with
a few caveats:

1.  Rust is beginning to appear in an area below the driver's side door
where that paint has been chipped.  It is a very small amount of rust
(that I can see) but could still be expensive to repair.  The '71 was
the first year with galvanized sheet metal.  Is this a big advantage or
only a small one?
2.  The exterior rubber is deteriorating (specifically, the rubber where
the windows rest when the door is closed.)  Shouldn't be a big deal.
3.  The windshield is cracked.  Can I get a replacement very easily for
this year?
4.  The upholstery needs replacement or repair.  

The seller is asking $6500 but could, most likely, be negotiated down to
$6000 or just below.  Assuming the car is in reasonable mechanical
condition (I will have a mechanic look at it before purchase) is this
good price?  If anyone one has any input on this price, this car, or
even '71 T's in general, I would really appreciate it.
Send me e-mail at scott.barbarick@cexp.com.

Thanks!
