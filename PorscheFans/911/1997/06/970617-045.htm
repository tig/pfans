Jeff, my 2 cents:

I have a 1990 Audi Coupe and 1995 Porsche 993, both with ABS and both
I have bled successfully, the Porsche several times.  The Audi has another
bleed port up by the master cylinder which has to be bled (I believe do
this first, then start on the other wheels).  The Porsche has to be done
in a careful sequence (RR, LR, RF, LF) to get a firm pedal and good 
track brakes.  The manual recommends hooking in a special Porsche
diagnoster tool and apparently triggering the ABS; I believe this is what 
your mechanic is implying.  I have had to bleed the Porsche two times in 
succession once or twice to get good brakes, so I believe he is partially
right.

I watched an Audi mechanic try to bleed the Coupe the standard way one time;
just by going to the wheels.  He couldn't bleed the front wheels;nothing
came out until as I remember he turned on the key and switched off the ABS
(possible on an Audi). 

By the way, I use a pressure bleeder; approx. 20 psi air pressure at the
brake 
reservoir to bleed at the calipers.

 Some of you may recall a humbling 140mph off-road excursion I had
 recently. Things are almost back to normal, but my mechanic tells me
 that rather than hot brakes, the cause may have been improperly bled 
 hydraulics. 
 
 He says ABS systems cannot be bled in the normal manner, but that the
 ignition must be on. (Also that when I removed the caliper the brake
 pedal should have been fully depressed to prevent air bubbles from
 floating upstream to the ABS unit, true?) Not mentioned before, a few
 days before my Paris-Dakkar prequalification run at the end of turn one,
 I had removed one rear caliper to replace a broken handbrake spring. I
 carefully bled that caliper and had a firm pedal, until about lap 15
 that is.
 
 He thinks air in the system caused the brakes to fail rather than too
 much braking for my own good. Anyone heard of this before, and if so,
 are there really special methods to bleed an ABS system? It's news to
 me.

 How do you explain to the insurance agent about tire marks on the hood?
