Hi folks,

Being a novice engine builder I would like to use this 911 'brains
trust' to help me out with some straight forward questions.

I have a '71 2.2 E that I have mentioned before (see 'racing sporto'
positing) that is being prepared for Historic racing in Australia.
Through this alias I have already been put in touch with an organisation
in Denver that seem to really know their stuff about the racing engine
that I will need for this car (2.3, twin plugged, 906 cam profile etc).
So that leaves me with the original 2.2 engine that is currently in the
car and  in need of a re-build.  I want to keep the original engine so
that when the cars racing days are done I will at least be able to truly
return the car to original numbers for authenticity (and value).

As most of you know the 'E' has a softer cam profile (and lower
compression) than the 'S' with maximum torque happening around 4500 as
opposed to the low 5000s for the S.  What I would like to know is the
following.

1.) What would the net effect be of putting 2.2 S pistons on the car
instead of the original 2.2 E pistons and not changing any other
components (I could make adjustments to the port sizes if that maximises
any benefit)?  

2.) Has anybody out there done this and what experiences did you have?

Some of you may ask why I would want to do this instead of doing a full
S conversion.  The main reason is that for events like the 'Targa
Tasmania' (fantastic bitumen rally for GT and sports cars of all eras)
in Australia, you really need an engine which  you don't have to be
constantly revving the stuffing out of get the desired performance for
varying terrain as opposed to the predictability of a closed circuit.
This is why the 1970 2.2 Porsche rally cars were of the 'S' spec with
180HP and the 'GT' versions of the same cars had a 2.3 motor producing
around 230 HP (8000 rpm)

Thanks in advance

Azim
