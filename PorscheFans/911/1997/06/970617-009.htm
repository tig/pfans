Check out the PCA Potomac Region website (www.pcapotomac.org).  It is one
of the best PCA sites, and it has a section
on buying a used 911.  These articles were written by Bruce Anderson and
were featured in Excellence.  This section gives
you general prices only, but if you can track down the back issues of
Excellence, Bruce had also displayed detailed pricing
for 911cab's '84 - '89.  Good luck in your search!
