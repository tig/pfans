I have a '69 912 and I'm at the "how much more $$ should I put into this =
car?" point.  I drive it every day and it runs very well.  The engine =
and trans (5 speed) were rebuilt by the previous owner and I've been =
working on getting it in good mechanical shape.  Now it's time for =
cosmetics.  It needs paint, a new headliner and dash and the seats could =
stand to be recovered.  (I have a new dash but haven't installed it.)  =
The body is pretty straight except for the RF fender and a dent in the =
front bumper, but the paint is cracked and chipped.   If I were to have =
it painted, I don't have the $ for a top end paint job so I'd probably =
get a 1k-1,500 job.  On top of all this, I think I'd really rather get a =
911 and put the money into it fixing up.  So, wise souls, am I better =
off trying to sell the car as-is to someone who has the time and =
resources to fix it up properly, or should I get a pretty good paint job =
and try to sell it at a higher price?   Does anyone have a sense of the =
price range for a car in the condition I've described?  (I'm in L.A. if =
that makes a difference.)

Thanks
