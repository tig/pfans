Hello PFans:

I have two sets of Fuchs, one of which needs spiffed up a bit.  I called
Imparts to get some paint and was advised that I should not paint these
wheels (imagine, talked out of a sale by the salesman) since the original
finish was anodized and I really should send them to Mr. Woods for proper
refinishing. 
1.  I assume this is true, re the original finish.  Is it?

2.  One set is for the track and has definitely been painted.  I think both
have been.
Any experience out there with painting these black again?  Is this a bad
idea, or what?
