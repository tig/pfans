Hi Dean:

You shouldn't have to move any lines.   Are you loosening the U-joint
located under the access cover in the trunk?  You need to loosen the
5mm Allen bracket and 2 13mm nuts.   It's tight in there so I cut down
the short end of the Allen key instead of taking out the blower.  Be
careful of popping off the nuts/bolts when you pry the rack up to
squeeze in the spacer.  I also found the supplied spacer bolts were too
long and needed to be trimmed to 42mm using a Dremel tool.

Regards,
