Brad-
Don't buy reproductions rims- they usually aren't of the highest quality.
Don't try to get by with repro rims just to save some money.  Quality is
always best in the long run.  Call Wheel Enhancement (no number, sorry) or
Ernie's Porsche Alloys in Miami (1-305-687-0028) and tell him exactly what
you want to do with the car.  Ask him about Speedlines, RUF, and Kinesis
rims.  The tire size that you have is a great size as far as performance
goes... you will get more tire on the pavement with wider rims.  You could go
all the way up to 11 inch rims in the back and 8.5 or 9 in the front.  As far
as tires, I'd go with Dunlop SP Sport 8000's, Pirelli P-Zeros, or the new
Bridgestone S-02's.  17" tires will not drastically hurt ride quality but
will improve handling.  Have fun and good luck!
