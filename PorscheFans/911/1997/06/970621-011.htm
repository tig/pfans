Hey Bryan,

I'm no purist :-) Our cars are meant to be used and if hauling is how you
need to use 'em then haul away!
Can you post some pictures? How exactly do you fit a hitch to a 911 without
any drilling? I'm not sure that a 964 has "tie down holes".

On your other points:  ... you're adding to wear, exposing them to road
grunge, wearing the wrong shoes if it rains too hard ... the only one that
I've experienced is the water issue and I've found the R1s are OK on the
highway even in the rain. I just slow down. I've not had them hydroplane.
Maybe they aren't worn enough yet.

Given that I don't have a chase car or a trailer driving on R1s to the
track works for me. Are they ideal? No. Are they OK? In my humble
experience, yes.

Cheers,
-Ez
