Here's an idea:

Locate the firefighters with the gas-powered chop saw, then contact your
local Corvette Club and charge the members $10 a minute to make the cuts.
You should be able to generate enough money to donate some to the
firefighters, keep a few bucks for yourself, and relieve the frustration of
many owners of oil-driupping bloated glass barges who insist on calling our
cars 'Volkswagens'.

(I had to put up with an entire weekend of 'VW' references at the last
event I attended.)
