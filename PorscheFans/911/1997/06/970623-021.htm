Re:  911 Sound Advice

Jeanne, Bob, & Richard:

I installed a Blaupunkt Laguna (CD43) CD/receiver in my '83SC in May '96 
and have been very satisfied with its performance to date.  It has skipped 
only once, which is a minor miracle as well as a testament to the 
robustness of its transport and error-correction system particularly 
considering the car's sport suspension and the minefields we use for roads 
in southwest Ohio.

I chose this unit for several reasons.  One, the local Best Buy was blowing 
'em out for $180.  Two, I had previous good experience with Blaupunkt.  And 
three, this unit was a "high-power" (25 kinda watts, 2-channel) model that 
allowed easy interface with the console-mounted fader.  I swapped (2) 5.25" 
JBL coaxes into the door panels (no alteration required) and (2) 4x6 
Blaupunkt coaxes in the rear deck (again no alteration needed).

I think this cheap system (less than $300 total) provides pretty good 
sound.  No I can't hear Ozzy burp off-mike during a drum solo with the 
windows down and the engine at full-chat.  But hey, if I want real high 
fidelity, I'll listen at home with a hell of a lot better equipment and no 
70 dB minimum noise floor.

The Blaupunkt may not have a really good FM tuner for good selectivity and 
fringe-area reception.  These are not problems in most metropolitan areas.

As far as Becker vs Blaupunkt goes, I have not heard any Becker units as 
far as I know.  I have seen some pretty lofty prices for them though ($500 
plus).  Could this be because they are made in der vaterland while the 
poor-relations Blaupunkts are made in Singapore or other Far East 
countries?  Don't know.

Regards and happy listenening,
Steve Albers
