Since this is the Internet, I know I will probably receive a little flak for
the following
request, but so what.... here goes.

I am looking for a 911 SC in the $12,000 to $13,000 or less price range.  I
would prefer a
1980 or later coupe with a sunroof, but will consider a targa or a 78 or 79
if the price and
condition is right.  Must have NO RUST.  This means no rust ever.  No "rust
repaired"
cars.  No accidents, (beyond a minor fender bender that has been properly
repaired).
Prefer original paint, or a repaint that had the trim removed for paint
prep.  I've seen too
many cars with tape marks on the door handles and window trim, and will not
consider
those.  If repainted, it must be the original color.  (No red cars that used
to be green)
I would also prefer  Fuchs wheels and leather interior.  Color is not too
important .

Prefer original engine and transmission if in good condition.  If rebuilt,
it should be done
by a reputable shop that has experience in Porsche rebuilds.  No amateur
jobs.  I would
like to see the receipts if available.

I am from Wisconsin, and will travel to find the right car, but will not
appreciate any
tired, project cars passed off as "cream puffs".  Been there, done that,
won't do it again.
Sorry if this sounds picky, but I only have a limited amount of vacation to
spend on car
shopping trips, and would like to find a car before the summer is over.

If you have a car that might fit this description, respond by E-mail to
Chuck at:
carrera@execpc.com

Send pictures if possible. I can view most electronic formats. 
Thanks for listening.  I've been without a Porsche for almost a year, and I
am getting a little cranky.

Chuck
