Bill,

I suspect that doing the whole seat would give you the best results
particularly as a perfect dye match on weathered leather is nearly
impossible... as far as actually doing the deed I did a color change in
my '80SC from brown to black with very good results. Tandy Leather has a
fair number of dye colors, I'm not sure about where to get authentic
dyes used on original Porsche leather but would love to hear if anyone
has an answer. Basically you clean the leather (lexol, etc), put a
leather stripper on it (which opens the pores), put the dye on, buff it,
and then put a sealer on (plastic like liquid with a variety of sheens
(flat, semi-gloss, gloss)).

Good luck, Jim.
