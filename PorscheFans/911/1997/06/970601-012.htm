Hello All,

Last summer I purchased a 1985 Carrera Coupe from an individual.  I later
spoke with the dealer that sold him the car, and he mentioned the car has
the factory upgraded interior with the turbo seats, a several thousand
dollar option in 1985.  

I want to clean & condition the leather seats and other leather interior
parts with Lexol, but the backs of the seats, as well as the rear seats,
appear to be vinyl.  However, I wasn't really sure if the "vinyl" was just
a different texture of the leather or if it is, in fact, vinyl.  

Also, the dashboard appears to be leather, and the door interiors appear to
be vinyl, except for the armrests.

Does anyone know for sure what is what?  I'm also assuming that vinyl
should not be treated with products designed for leather.  Thanks in
advance.
