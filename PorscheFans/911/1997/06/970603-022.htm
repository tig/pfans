it was a few years ago that i read about it, but i recall that full
galvanization started on some of the late 77's.  it was a pretty
thorough process.  both sides of the panels were coated and the zinc
actually added about 31 lbs to the weight of the car(so this wasnt just
a zinc primer).   seemed to work, i had a 77 that was just starting to
get some paint bubbles.  today i have a 78 and i couldnt find rust if
somebody paid me.
