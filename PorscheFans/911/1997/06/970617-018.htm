Ray-
As you might know I do locating and brokering.  I live in southern IN and
happen to know of two 911 slantnoses and a Ferrari 308GTSi for sale by a
woman here in town.  Her husband recently passed away and she is thinning out
her garage.  Here's the scoop:
1985 slantnose conversion Euro 930   Red/ tan          56K miles
C2 body kit & tail, all correct lights and rubber, AJ USA shock tower strut,
adjustable rear spring plates w/ Hime joints, RSR front cross member w/ Hime
joints, B&B muffler, Mocal oil cooler, gel battery, engine has been ported
and polished by Franz Blaum, SC cams, twin plug heads w/ crank fired
ignition, Koklin 1000 CC Intercooler w/ C2 air control system, K-29 turbo w/
8mm shaft (also has a K-30 turbo avail.), 1996 Bi-Turbo brake package (13"
VMI ceramic & aluminum rotors), stainless & teflon brake lines, RSR shocks
and springs w/ mono ball, custom polished 18" Speedline 3-piece rims (8.5 &
11) w/ new Bridgestone SO-2 tires (225/40f & 285/30r).  Only 500 miles on
suspension, brakes, and tires.       I'll have to find out the asking price
when I get serious inquiries.

1983 Factory Euro slantnose 930     silver blue      28K miles
This car was customed ordered through the Porsche special wishes program-
sticker was $105,000.  Custom paint, full leather interior, Recaro seats, B&B
muffler, factory installed 16 BBS RZ rims or custom polished 17" C2 Turbo
rims- each with new rubber, otherwise the car is stock- extremely fast and in
excellent shape mechanically & cosmetically.      Asking price is in the 40K
range.

Both cars have approx. $2000.00 stereo systems installed along with minor
custom work such as Momo wheels and shifter and customs floor mats.
Info on the Ferrari or on my Lotus Elan (also for sale) can be sent on a
request basis.
Thanks,
Brian Buxton
