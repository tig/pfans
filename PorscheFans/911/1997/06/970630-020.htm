I saw a 996 in the flesh Wednesday two weeks ago. I was standing outside
the entry to the Nordschleife, waiting for it to open for the public
(BMW was testing there that day, and I could see a few Porsches as well
screaming around the track). Anyway, as I was standing there, a black
996 exited out of the ring. I couldn't believe my luck. My immediate
impression was that it looked good, and it certainly sounded good. We
started chasing it as it drove off, and we found it again standing
outside the local Porsche garage. Got a (hopefully) good picture of it,
including the driver (who was just grinning at us).

A great day!
