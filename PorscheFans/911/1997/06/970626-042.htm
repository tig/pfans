My car ('75S w/stock 2.7, rebuilt 30K miles ago) has been running quite 
poorly lately.  I thought that the points had gone bad again (had a 
couple bad sets a few months ago--car ran terribly), but the gap was 
fine and everything looked OK there.

While checking the timing, I noticed an intermittent ticking noise,
sounded just like a small electric arc, seemed to be coming from the area 
around the distributor.  Everytime the tick sounded, the engine stumbled, 
just a bit.  I think the ticking increased with RPM, but it's kinda hard 
to hear a light sound in the engine compartment of a 911....  The car is 
definitely down on power, especially noticeable at lower RPMs (2-4K).  
Starting is a bit more difficult than usual.

I took at look at the idling engine in the dark, but I didn't see 
the "light show" that people talk about when their ignition wires are 
going bad.  On the other hand, it's a CIS engine, so the wires are 
wrapped in metal braid, so maybe I wouldn't see it?

Does this sound like a problem with the ignition wires, or some other 
horrifying disease?  If it is the ignition wires, does anyone have the 
procedure for re-using the braided covers?  I don't feel like paying the 
extra $140 for the CIS type wires if that's the only difference.

TIA.
