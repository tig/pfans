Hello to you air cooled guys,



I just finalized the sale of a 944S2 that I have been driving for several 
years.  I have been a member of the 944 list and have also dropped in on 
the 911 list as time has allowed.  I am starting the process of finding a 
good 911.  Had my heart set on an 87 or newer FACTORY turbo look 
COUPE(emphasis on factory & coupe).  After watching the market for 
several years these cars seem to come up for sale very seldom.  I have 
been watching in the Phoenix area, as well as Southern California.  A 
1986 3.3 Turbo turned up in the local market last weekend, I went for a 
test drive and it seems to be in very good (and original) condition.  The 
car is for sale by the original owner who purchased it at the 
P-Dealership in Scottsdale, AZ, and all service has been completed at the 
dealership as well.  The car has 50K miles and is bone stock down the the 
factory audio equipment.  Finally to my question.  This will be my only 
vehicle so it will be my daily driver.  I only drive 12k or so a year, 
but I am wondering if maint. will eat me alive.  I have owned both a 
911SC and a 911 3.2 Carrera in the past so I am familiar with the service 
requirements.  I understand that with the complexity of the turbo the 
parts (drivetrain, brakes, engine) are more expensive, and also that 
regular maint. such as valve adjustments etc. will cost more for labor.  
How about longevity?  I don't know of anyone else driving a 911 Turbo 
daily.  Any experience out there?  I have already spoken with my mechanic 
about a pre-purchase inspection, so I will definitely be cautious with my 
buying decision.  The asking price for the car is $32,000 with some room 
to negotiate.  Looking through the Blue Book, the market reports in 
Excellence, and asking around this seems to be within reason.  Any advice 
on driving, purchasing,servicing, or pricing on the turbo would be 
greatly appreciated. Are the factory turbo-look Carrera's as elusive and 
rare as it seems? I would still prefer one over a "real" turbo, but can't 
ever find any for sale.  Thanks to all, and I look forward to 
participation in the 911 list as much as my experience allows.
