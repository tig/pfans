Let's put an end to the speculation.  The galvanization started on the most
exposed underbody parts and wheel arches in '70, with full galvanization in
'76.  Many pre-'76's will even have galvanized parts, minus the roof of the
coupe.  This is fully documented in Frere's 5th ed. of 911 story, page 191.

I have a '77 Coupe with original paint, driven in the rain, through floods,
and all with no rust, original paint.  If there's a non destructive method
to check, tell me how, and I will.  Furthermore, it does seem to weigh 31
lbs. more than it should ;)
