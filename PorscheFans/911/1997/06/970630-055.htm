-	The torque. I love the torque!
-	Not being able to drive around the Microsoft campus slowly (the
route to my building is cuuuuurrrvyyy). If it weren't for the recently
installed speedbumps...
-	The anxious feeling I get when my wife takes the car out. The
sigh of relief when I hear her pulling into the garage.
-	Sticking the fuel filler in the front fender (people look). 
-	Checking the oil with the motor running (more looks).
-	I *try* to drive conservatively (save fuel, avoid tickets,
etc...), but no matter what, I cannot avoid approaching several corners
during my commute hot, heel-toe shifting, and pouring it on as I exit.
3-9 on the wheel all the time. Big Fat Grin!

I recently posted a message to the list.  It follows in part...

I love my 911 cab.  I've had it for three months now and I still get
excited just looking at the car.  Does this feeling go away?  

Apparently from all the responses I have received, the answer is a
definite NO!  One that particularly made me roll on my office floor was
a response by J. Horton.  He wrote...

	I've had my Targa for over a year now....And I still sometimes
sit and stair at it.

Now I am wondering how many others have a staring relationship with
their Porsche!  I'll admit that every time I walk by 
.
