   I live in Southeastern Wisconsin, about 45 minutes drive from one of the
premier road race tracks in the world - Road America.  Both car and cycle
races are hosted at RA during the season.  If you're in the area on a race
weekend,  I certainly encourage you to attend.  It's a beautiful 4 mile
track with changing elevation, is a favorite with the drivers, and is
generally acknowledged to have the best track food in the US.  
   Major events include:  The SCCA June Sprints (lots of P-Cars) on June
20-22 ; Historic Races (excellent) on July 18-20 ; and CART Indy cars
August 15-17.  The Chicago Region PCA also has a major club event over
Labor Day weekend.  PCA Milwaukee Region maintains "Porsche Park" - leave
your car parked there if you wish.  Wear hiking shoes and visit a variety
of corners for differing views of the track.  Check out the great RA web
site at  -  http://roadamerica.com  -  It's very helpful, lists all the
normal spectator weekends, and now even provides a detailed hourly schedule
for upcoming events.  Highly Recommended!

Disclaimer - I have no affiliation with Road America - just have enjoyed
attending events there for over 20 years.
