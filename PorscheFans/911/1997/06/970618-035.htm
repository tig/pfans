Brad,

A few months ago I solicited advice from the list for my windshield in an
84 w/defrost element.  

My company sent me to Vistar as well.  It appears that they have 
begun buying up regional glass shops or something, and have struck
some serious deals with the major insurers. Anyways, I had a very 
good experience with them here in Columbus OH, after expecting to 
get screwed like I have with every other insurance claim I've ever 
submitted.

A lot of people warned me about do's and don'ts with the windshields,
the most major one being "order that the seal be replaced"...

Anyways, Vistar had to custom order the glass because of the defrost
element, (and mine was tinted at the top too, BTW, without an antenna)
That took about 10 days.  They also told me to bring it to the shop 
for the day rather than have a mobile deal come out (which pleased me).  
I set up the deal with the manager, and when I suggested a new seal, he balked,
and very matter of factly stated that it wasn't needed, he knew the 
proper technique, and stated that he wasn't planning on getting one.
I bent and said OK, but took pictures of the frame, molding and 
seal just in case it got trashed in the process.

Lo and behold I picked it up that afternoon, the glass looked perfect,
had the typical Sekurit markings identical to the original, and the seal
and trim was perfect, you would have never known it was replaced.

One odd twist though:  It wasn't until the end of the installation
that they discovered that the bottom driver's side corner of the glass
exhibited "lamination separation" in an area about the size of a quarter.
(A funny, psychadelic shaped pattern where the two layers of glass have started
to separate >very< slightly, allowing you to notice the lamination in between)
He told me that they didn't notice it until after they were done, and he would 
voluntarily order another windshield and re-do the job, or he'd knock
$100 off the cost of the deductible if I'd take it as is. 

A glass that is doing that can get moisture between the two layers
that have separated it, turning the area a hazy white color, very noticable.
This typically happens if the car gets wet a lot.

Since my car barely gets wet when I wash it, and rarely sees rain,
I took it as is and promptly spent the extra $100 on pieces parts
with Automotion as soon as I got home! Four months later, it still is 
barely noticable.

Hope this helps,

Matt

84 Carrera Targa
86 Mustang SVO
A couple other beaters not worth mentioning...
