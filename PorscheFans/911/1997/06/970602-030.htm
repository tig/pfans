As I wrote some months ago I feel pretty uneasy on the P-list since my 964
turbo seems to work so well that I'm not able to partecipate to any of the
mechanical troubles discussion (Just a intermittently noisy fuel pump,
perfectly functional - Bruce, is that o.k.? - and the common Porsche
underpowered AC, absolutely useless on triple black turbo)!
Willing to be in some way useful, I'll report my recent personal
experiences in estethical care.

Body: Zymol Carbon is still my favorite one; since my car is black, the
challenge is great for a wax. Waxing tip: wax a small surface and wipe out
immediately in two light steps, the first one removes the eccess and the
second for a shining finish.
Rubber trim and tires: ERV One Grand; don't spray it directly, but use a
small sponge as applicator; several passes give a satin, not gloss finish.

Wheels: if you spend frequently some minutes removing brakes dust from them
with a wet synth chamois(two passes), you needn't anything else and will
avoid electrocorrosion; anyway Porsche wheel cleaner is the best, in my
opinion, if necessary.

Leather upholstery: very disappointed by Lexol conditioner; it gave to my
matt finished full leather interior a glossy look I hate. I'm still
patiently removing it with a wet synth chamois and waiting for my old
favorite Connoly Hide Food or similar.

Windshield repair: having a small bullseye on my windshield I tried Loctite
Windshield Repair Kit. No way. Very easy process but so disapponting result
that I had to promptly remove the repair with a small knife (without
damage). The compound was not levelled with the glass (and i can't realize
how it could level) and the dark spot due to the internal refraction
(glass-film-glass) didnt, obviously, disappear. May be it works on bigger
damages where I absolutely prefere to subsitute the damaged part.

Sorry for the bandwaste, just my small attempt to be useful to the list...

Aldo
