Does anyone know about an upgrade to the stock brake calipers on an '87 911
Carrera?  My calipers need to be rebuilt (car pulls heavily to one side under
braking) and i usually try to upgrade when i service the car.  I would
obviously like to go to some with more stopping power but i don't know about
the compatibility.  The only brake upgrade i have seen advertised is for the
"Big Red" calipers (standard on new turbo) upgrade on C2's.  This upgrade is
a few thousand and overkill of my car.  Any info would be appreciated.

Darrel, in response to your brake job from hell, i have the same bad feel in
my pedal after i change pads and bleed.  I don't have a warm fuzzy feeling
when im trying to brake from 120 to 40 in driver's ed events.  Hopefully this
spongy feel will improve with the new calipers, but it doesn't sound like it
helped you.  Question:  Could we have bad(or going bad) master cylinders?

I DO think that there is a left and right caliper difference.  Beside the
part number and bleed nipple difference the piston that contacts the back of
the brake pads are different.  The cylinder that presses the pads together
are not perfectly smooth.  They are recessed due to uneven heat distribution
along the brake pad(leading edge versus trailing edge).  The uneven heat
distribution causes the pad to expand differently so the cylinder is recessed
to achieve even pad wear.  I think i explained that right....anyway there is
a diagram in the Hayes' Porsche manual for the exact location of the recessed
portion of the cylinder.  If you have any questions let me know and i'll try
to explain a little more clearly.
