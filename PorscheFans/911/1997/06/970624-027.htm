There is a car accessory company in New Zealand that sells a clear plastic
adhesive film which, when applied to a number plate has an interesting
property.  It's  transparent under normal light, but opaque when exposed to
flash light (something to do with the frequency of flash light.)  I've seen
a 'demo' where they took a flash and a normal light photograph and the
plate appears blank in the flash photo.  Tricky, eh?

As for suggestions -- check your local road laws, ask for the operational
records and obligatory site tests and daily maintenance and scheduled
calibration tests of the equipment being used on the day.  Also ask for the
records of the police personnel operating the equipment of the day --
including proof that they passed adequate instruction and have recent
training in specifically the equipment used for your photo.  Like any large
bureaucracy, the Police fail to keep things in order.  Any mistakes on
their part and your ticket could well be rejected out of hand.  Also,
failure on their part to provide this information would invalidate the
ticket.  All's fair.

If you have time and budget, do this research and attack the circumstances
directly.  Was it foggy, peak hour, heavy traffic?  Maybe there was sources
of interference to the laser or radar -- air traffic overhead , strong
microwave signals (cellular telephone or other microwave repeaters on a
nearby tower or hill top.)  Maybe the equipment was obscured by a tree or
wall or too far or too close to the road.  Maybe traffic in the opposite
direction is in the photo?
