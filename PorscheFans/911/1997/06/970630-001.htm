Pfans:
With the warm weather came more derivability problems with my leaky CIS   
so I finally bit the bullet and opted to remove the entire system to   
better check each component during assembly.  I left the engine in the   
car and raised it on ramps more to relieve my old back than to aid in   
access.  Not a big deal but a few tips will ease your way if anyone else   
needs or wants to do the same.  With the heater blower removed (mine is   
removed so much its missing), the air cleaner and rubber bellows that   
connects the input of the throttle body and the fuel distributor are   
removed.  Disconnect the throttle linkage, Cold start wires, vacuum lines   
and such so you can remove the throttle body from the top of the airbox.   
 I also removed the fuel distributor.  To make life easier I found that   
having a 1/4 drive 5mm allen socket on a short extension with a 1/4 drive   
ratchet gave you enough clearance to get the 6 spring loaded bolts out.   
 I left the injectors in place and disconnected the fuel lines at the   
injectors and the fuel and wires to the warm running compensator on #2   
feed tube.  The fuel feed was disconnect at the filter and the return at   
the bracket on the left side of the engine.  With the throttle body out   
of the way you have pretty clean access to the 8mm nut holding the rear   
box bracket to the base of the bell crank assembly. Last I unbolted the   
feed tubes at the heads and lifted the box and tubes straight up and out   
of the car. I stuck rags down the head intakes to keep unwanted junk out   
and will take the shop vac to them before I put it back together.  Now I   
just have to find out what the heck is leaking.  A visual inspection of   
the box looks OK and after removing the screws the two halves wont   
separate with the glue joint solid all the way around.  All the intake   
gaskets where seated well. Tonight I'll recheck the air valve and if I   
don't find anything else vacuum test the box.  Ain't older cars fun??
