Greetings Michael,
I purchased an 84 Euro Cab about three years ago.
Underneath the from drivers seat an  idle stabalizer was added, small
things like the side maker lights in the rear lights where added for US
specs and the Euro headlights were replaced with U.S. headlights and a cat
was added.
I purchased the car from a person who had it imported themselves. The
conversion was done somewhere in Indiana. I was a little leary at first but
after checking it out I had no problems with the title or anything. To
Wisconsin it was just another Porsche.
Chain updates had the seperate oil lines on the top of each chain tensioner
for a quick visual check.
Wish you luck, its not hard to find parts just be sure you watch carefully
when ordering from catalogs as some parts are different.
Hope you enjoy your new car.
