I have a '93 C2 Cab that I bought used but when I asked the Porsche salesman
at the dealership about whether the storage deck was an option or not he told
me that all the Cabs from '93 had it and rear seats were not available.  I
never checked to see if this was fact or not. Personally, for me the storage
area and "cubbyholes" are a lot better than rear seats would have been.
