Today, I was driving the '84 911 on its ritual "run it long enough to =
get the moisture out of the oil and exhaust" circuit, about 15 miles of =
country roads and an interstate cloverleaf.  The temperature gauge was =
past the initial white zone and up to the first white mark, which is =
where it stays most of the time when running.

During the trip, the car wasn't pulling as strong as I thought it =
should, but I attributed it to high temperature and rare air.  As I was =
getting on to the interstate for the last leg of the run, I noticed that =
the car hesitated at about 3200rpm and didn't pull nearly as well as =
normal between 3500 and 5000.  It didn't seem to be missing and wasn't =
backfiring or bucking - it just didn't seem to have its normal power.  =
As I came off the interstate and made my way home, it ran fine up to =
about 2500 but continued unable to deliver the normal amount of power =
above 3000.

The car has 57000 miles, has had regular service, doesn't smoke, idles =
OK (idling between about 900 and 800 when warm), starts easily hot or =
cold, and generally has always seemed to run extremely well and =
consistently.

Any ideas??  Any and all suggestions will be most appreciated.
