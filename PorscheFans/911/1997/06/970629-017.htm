I know this is dumb, but I can't figure out how to remove the radio in my '89
C4.  There are 4 holes at the corners, but I can't figure out how the
faceplate is to be removed.  I'm sure it's just some kind of pin or
something, but just sticking in a round item in the holes doesn't seem to do
anything.

I get a puff of smoke from the tail pipe sometimes when I start the car.  It
happens maybe every twentieth time I start or so.  It is a fairly large
amount of smoke when it happens and it only lasts about a second.  Most of
the time there is no smoke on startup, and the car passed emmisions test with
no problems.  I have not overfilled with oil, and it only has happened when
the weather is fairly warm (>60F).  The car consumes a fair amount of oil
normally, about 1 quart every 800 miles. Is this oil consumption normal?  Any
ideas about the smoke?
