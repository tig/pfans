Hi Jeff

Yes, the Wiper Salute is traditional amongst C2/C4 drivers at track events.
Optionally, you may turn your washer nozzles to the side so you can spray spectators
getting too close to the track for safety, or alternately warn off that guy who is
trying to pass you in the corners at Driver's Ed events.

If you are at a track where the Salute is poorly understood, and might be
misonstrued to indicate a fumble fingered bozo is at the wheel, then do what I do
and remove the wiper fuse.
