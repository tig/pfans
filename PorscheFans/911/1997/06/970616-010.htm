Take it to a good mechanic for an inspection, including a look at the
underside while it is up on the hoist. Rusted out floor pans, and front
suspension pans are common.

Check out Bruce Anderson's articles in recent issues of Excellence. It
all depends on the condition of the car, and whast you can find out
about its history. I bought one that had just had a bottom up engine
rebuild for $3,500, but the body needed work, more than I thought from
first inspection. I have spent about $9,000 to bring the body and
interior up to concours condition. The car appraised at $17,500. That
would, I think, be the top end price for a car in perfect condition.
$2,500 to $4,000 for a car that needs a lot of work, which most will.

Now that the restoration is finished, I love the car. I have always
preferred the classic lines of the early 911s. The 2.0 litre engine is
no tire burner, but it is a good strong power plant with few known
inherent problems. Again, Bruce's article will alert you to any known
problems to look out for.
