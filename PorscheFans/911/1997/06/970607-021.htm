Christian,

This doesn't seem like your run of the mill bad mechanic. It sounds more
like a mechanic who got himself in over his head somehow. He sounds like a
nice enough guy but may not know that much about what he's doing. If it
were me, I would be uncomfortable doing business that way (no invoices, no
idea what the final tab is, etc.).  I like to know what's wrong, what it's
going to cost, and how long, and I frequent shops that treat me that way.
If you want to stick with him, I'd advise learning as much as you can
about your model of car and your car in particular and then "double
checking" his work on your vehicle (like you did with the muffler). Good
luck...
