I was at a local dealer yesterday looking at a 92 C2 cab and got the 
following story:

90 and 91 cabs have rear seats and rear lap belts
92 and 93 had no rear seats because as of 92, US laws required rear 3 pt 
harness and Porsche had no solution.
94 to present have rear seats and 3 pt harnesses. The rear seats are 
fixed (not folding) and the shoulder harness comes from a center bolster 
rather than the common outboard mounting.
