I just had my cyl head studs replaced I wanted racewares but my mechanic
put in the 993 studs...he said after talking to a friend at ANDIAL they
recommend
now using 993 studs...all I know is that they had some problems with the
racewares (what they were I don't know) and that the 993 studs are thicker
and
they are theaded all the way which helps thermal cooling???what I'd like to
know is how long does the factory warranty these studs???I know they hve no
guaranty like the racewares....I hope this was the right move as I don't
feel like taking them out now...what do you say fans...especially you bruce
A.

please some input on this>>>>>>aloha,,,,merlin
