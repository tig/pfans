 Well I am going to add my $.02 worth on this issue. I think first of all,
that those type of savings are worth getting. If you take into effect, that
you are paying in after tax dollars, the delta spreads to almost double ( at
least here in Canada). However, I think a good working relationship with
your P-Dealer is important and worth something. 

The dollar amount must be weighed against other issues: 
- Has he been fair in the past?
- Is there a reason why his parts are more expensive?
- When there has been an emergency, has he dropped everything to help you?

My P-Dealer in Vancouver (Weissach) earned my loyalty by getting me out of a
severe jam on boxing day in the interior of BC. Every other Porsche dealer
in the interior was shut down until well after New Years. This kind of
service is WORTH ALOT TO ME !!!!

I think it always pays to be astute and know your prices. This shows the
dealer that you have done your homework and will continue to do your
homework. But in the end, it is your HONEST relationship with your dealer
that matters most.  I think all P-Dealers have the right to earn a living
and not get nickled and dimed to death BUT THEY MUST BE FAIR !!!!!
