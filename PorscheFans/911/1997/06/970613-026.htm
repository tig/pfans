On my way home today my clutch - transmission started feeling "funny". It did
not want to down -shift to 2nd and really did not want to go into 1 st. Double
clutching dosen't help and it's by Brute Force and Ignorance ? that I made it
home. 
Once in 1st - 2nd fine but then 5th is now ~ where 3rd was? Please let me
explain further... 2nd goes directly into 5th., or quite easily into 5th i have
to come back and physically "look" for third. Before I call up my
mechanic/dealer could someone PLEASE share some insight ?
1.) Clutch adjustment ? 
It hasn't even suggested there was a problem so i doubt this fix.
2.) Tranny problems ?  
While this would probably be the most expensive it's where i'm thinking the
problem will show up  :^(
Nothing has been done to the car in the last few weeks to even think would
cause fault If i go out and depress clutch with car off running idling, rolling
it around the car does not want to go into 1st.   Any ideas I'm Perplexed at
this point....
Denny
