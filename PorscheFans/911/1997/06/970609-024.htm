    Hi Alex --
     
    >[snip]
    >While I was at the speedo shop, I had mine checked.  Seems to be about

    When I first bought my car year before last, it seemed like suddenly 
    everyone else on the road was driving lots faster than before...so I 
    checked my speedo (by computing speed vs rpms given gear ratios, tire 
    diameter, etc, and assuming the tach was accurate) and sure enough it was 
    reading about 10% high at just about any speed.  So my speedo error was 
    consistent with what you're seeing, and even reasonably consistent with the 
    C&D Turbo S test.
     
    When I think of all those extra "virtual miles" that *shouldn't be* on my 
    odometer...sigh.

    I'm not sure exactly how either, but it can be done.  My speedo shop guys 
    were able to adjust mine to read accurately.
