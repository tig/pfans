There's been a fair amount of heat exchanger discussion lately, so mayb=
e
someone can help me with this question.  One of my projects is to junk =
my
rusted heat exchangers, and put on a used set (bought from the list) th=
at will
give me heat again.  These are stock, except they have the thick flange=
s that
I'll have to machine to fit on my short studs.  They also have a short
extension that fits up into the exhaust port.  I think this means the u=
sed set
came off a late SC.

I can't believe that the heat exchanger to head gaskets for 3.0 SC engi=
nes cost
$10 to $12 each!  Meanwhile, the same gaskets for the later 3.2 engines=
 are
only $2 to $3 each.

What's so special about the expensive gaskets, and has anyone successfu=
lly used
the cheaper later gaskets on an SC engine?  Is it a function of the hea=
t
exchanger design (there are three different part numbers covering the e=
arly
SCs, late SCs, and then the Carreras) or is it the head?

I'm sending this from work, but if you reply direct to me, please send =
to
msalvetti@sprynet.com.

Thanks!
