I just noticed that the passenger side headlight intermittently cuts out.  If
you press it really hard it goes back on but the jiggling of driving causes
it to cut out again.  It doesn't feel exceptionally loose.  Anyone else have
this problem?

BTW, I went to a driver's school at Sebring several weeks ago and had a very
good time.  My Third Foot accelerator cover worked perfectly.  The SP8000's
worked well but do not like high pressure; at stock pressures it was like
driving on ice.  I ended up with 35 PSI hot/31 PSI cold after some very
UNscientific testing; lower pressure may be better still.  I may get some
race tires for the future.  Anyone have any experience with the Yoko race
tires (A032?)?  They look very aggressive.

Interestingly, all previous cars seemed "looser" after a day at the track but
not the Carrera; it still feels like a block of granite.
