The secondary oil thermostat in a C2/4 is of a different design than of
the engine thermostat and can indeed fail.  It is very easy to test
either on or off the car.  If your oil temp has gone up from what you
feel it should be, simple put your hand on the shroud in front of the
right front tire and feel for heat coming off of the plastic shroud
(very unscientific) when the engine temp gauges shows excessive heat. 
If the shroud is cool to ambient temp, you probably have found your
problem (this is assuming that your fan belt is intact...first thing to
check).

The next step would be to remove the plastic covers on the right side of
the car underneath the door.  Start with the plate in front of the right
rear wheel..there are two plastic nuts (10mm head size) and two sheet
metal screws holding the plate on.  Access is easier with the wheel off
and the right side in the air on jack stands.  With this plate off, the
thermostat regulator is now visible.  With the engine running, check the
two long oil lines that exit the aluminum housing and go to the front of
the car.  They probably will be hot for a few inches away from the
regulator...but about 8-12 inches away they will be relatively cool.  If
this is your symptom, the termostat is stuck shut.  

The thermostat can easily be tested by putting it into a pan of very hot
to boiling water.  Observe the silver piston (for lack of a better word)
and its dimension to the outer stainless steel sleeve.  When it is hot,
the "piston" will extend about 15mm away from the steel sleeve.  It will
be very apparent.  If you get no change, then your t-stat is definitely
bad.

I just replaced one on a customers 1991 C4.  The parts were $95.00 for
the t-stat and $3.20 for the o-ring and are available from Porsche.  The
Chilton's labor guides shows 1.2 hrs for the repair.  If you paid
$326.00, my opinion is that it was an extreme amount.  The repair is
very simple, the t-stat is held in only by a snap ring.  You will loose
all of the oil that is in your oil tank.

Good luck...Don Istook
