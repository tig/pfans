Thanks for all who responded on my question about the elusive, (apparently
non-existent) $15 pop-off valve.  At the end of this message I have copied
a tip that I received that may provide a solution to the exploding airbox
syndrome, without cutting a hole in the airbox.

I have another question which shows how wet behind the ears I am at 911
maintenance.  I decided to give my newly acquired 911 SC an oil change and
a treat by switching to Mobil 1.  When I got underneath to drain the oil I
expected to see two drain plugs, one in the tank and one in the middle of
the crankcase. In all other 911's I've looked under,  the crankcase drain
is in the middle of a round metal cover.  My cover is blank, as in no
drainplug.  Is it safe to undo the nuts that hold the cover in place and
drain the oil that way, or am I looking in the wrong place entirely? 
What's under the plate?  Why would my car have this type of cover?

Re the recent comments on posting replies to the listing, I agree
completely.  As a newbie, I  certainly appreciate the information that's
distributed.

I've never seen popoffs that low, but the mechanics with the heavy German
accents just say leave the big end of your CIS boot a little loose and
let that blow off.
