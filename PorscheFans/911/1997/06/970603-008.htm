Never say never.  I have seen more than one SC with rust around the 
lower windshield area (and even at the joint between the front fender
and the piece of sheet metal at the bottom of the windshield).  John
Paterek has pictures of a mid-to-late '80s Carrera with rusted out
rocker panels...

Just because a car is galvanized doesn't mean it is impervious to rust.
All it takes is a nick in that galvanized coating to allow corrosion to 
begin.  The problem with front fenders is that crap thrown up by the
front
tires collects in the nooks and crannies around the fuel filler neck,
etc.
and provides a prime location for corrosion to begin (especially on the 
Euro cars as I've heard that they use some nasty stuff on the roads over
there...)
