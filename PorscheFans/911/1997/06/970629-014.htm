I have completed the "fix" for stock Carrera brakes on the track.  You can try 
every fluid around Motul, Castrol, ATE et it will help some but not fix the 
problem.  A brake cooling kit such as AJ's will be the biggest help.  Better 
pads with backing plates like Performance friction with the carbon fiber 
backing plates will help. Put them all together and your almost there.  
Braking technique will help some as well.  I learned to drive on the track in 
lighter less powerful cars than the 911 and used trail braking a  lot.  With 
the 911 I found to help with brake overheating I need to brake late and hard 
to have the brakes applied for a shorter period of time and increase cooling 
time.  I now limit trail braking to places where it is really needed to turn 
the car.  I can now go to TWS without touching the brake fluid for a 2 day 
weekend.  I can even run Hallett and only bleed the fronts the morning of day 
2.  I am afraid with stock calipers this is as good as it gets.  Going to 
larger calipers will fix the problem and improve brake power but moves you up 
in class.

Subject: 	Brake Fluid Recommendations







    I had my 1986 911 on the track last week.  Everything went fine
    until.......... extreme brake fade.  Thankfully, it was under the
    yellow flag because my usually rock hard pedal went all the way to the
    floor.

    I am bringing my car into the shop to have the fluid changed.  I plan
    on doing several other track events this year.  Any recommendations on
    the type of fluid I should use.  The dealership said that Porsche makes
    a "slightly" upgraded fluid.  Should I go with this or another type?


    help, help, help
