From Hank's response I feel like I've lost all credibility on the list now!!
 I do agree with some of what Hank has said, but I find it funny that he is
arguing that smaller tires are not better for autocrossing when he doesn't
cite experience with anything larger than 225 & 245/50's.  I don't consider
245's to be overly large, and unless I misunderstood the original question I
thought Scott was thinking of running 275/285's on his car.  His original
question was <<I was wondering if I could go up a size from the stock 255 40
rears and 205 45 fronts.  Is there room to go wider, if so, how much>>  I
still argue that he will do better with the same tire size he has on very
wide 16" rims (maybe 225's in front at most).  I "only" have 265/40's on the
rear of my 930, but I guarantee that with my 10" rear rims I have more tire
contact than I would with a 9" rim using the same tire.  Why was my
suggestion of wide 16" rims and 255/40r and 225/45f tires so ignorant?

Hank also stated <<The idea that the added wind resistance of a wider tire is
a significant negative factor at autocrossing speeds is ridiculous.>>  But
the idea of rolling resistance and again, unsprung weight, is not.  And what
if Scott wants to do some track time on top of his autocrossing?  Is my
suggestion still ridiculous?  I was trying to give some information to cover
a wide range of possibilities, and I still stand by what I said.
Anyway, good luck Scott!
