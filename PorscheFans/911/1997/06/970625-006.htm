I'm looking to add splash guards to the rear wheel wells of my unflaired   
75.  I checked a couple of the catalogs I have and didn't see anything   
specific to 911's.   Automotion had something for 944's but not having   
them in hand I don't know how well or if they would fit.  Has anyone else   
done this or have a source for guards specific to 911's??  TIA

==========================
Terry, here's what I did...

I made a template out of cardboard in the shape of of the rear fender.
I then went to the local auto store and bought SUV (large) mudflaps ~$15
I used the template to make an oversized 911 flap ,about 2" at the bottom
and 1.5 on the sides following the fender contour. I cut it using sheetmetal
sheers. Works great!

I then used a plastic cable clamp and removed the first bolt that holds the
rear lower panel (the one you are trying to protect) and attached the
cable clamp to it. Did not want to drill into the body. I then pushed
sharp scissors through flap and the clamp and attached it to it using
tie wraps.

The other two attaching points are to the support bracket running up/down
supporting the corner of the lower body panel. Once the flap is level,
I punched four holes to run tie wraps attaching the flaps to the support
bracket.

It gives enough protection, and there is enough of a gap between the body
and mudflaps to prevent dirt from accumulating there.

In the front, I usually use racer's tape befor track events. Its much easier.

I have also used the mud flap material to construct air diverters for
my front brakes ( like on 968s, attached to A-arms) and rear ones attached
to banana arms. 

Hope this helps!

Lou, 84 Carrera
