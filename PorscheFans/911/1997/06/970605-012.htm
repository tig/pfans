PFans,
  I just installed a new Recaro SRD in my '86 911 with
the supplied mounting brackets and but the setup just
isn't satisfactory. The seat rails sit a full 2 inches higher
than the factory seats and the attachment for the seat belt
is halfway between my hip and my knee (6" forward of
the stock location).  The vendor expressed surprise that
I had a problem as he's sold 100's and never heard of this
happening.  It seems like I just need the correct rails (w/seat
belt attachment point) and I wouldn't need the adaptor and
its misplaced seat belt mounting point and 2" lift.
Anybody had/solved this problem?
  On a related note: I am reluctant to drill a hole through
the DME box  <g> to mount the eyebolt for the (driver's side)
substrap.  Do I have to move the DME or is there an easier way?

Please copy me directly as I'm on the digest.
 TIA,
  Chris
