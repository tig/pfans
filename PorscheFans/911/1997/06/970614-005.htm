     "I could use a little advice.  For the second time recently (in the 
     past month) my batteries have gone dead.  The "Voltage" idiot light 
     has been coming on in the dash recently, though most of the time it is 
     just barely on, while at other times it is on full brightness."
     
     This sounds like a voltage regulator that is on the way out. I haven't
had this problem with my 911 yet but I did have it happen on my daily driver
( older Jaguar XJS). The symptoms were that the alternator would put out
enough juice to keep the battery charged if I using it during the day with no
ac, fans etc.  Drive at night or use the ac and the battery would be dead in
a day or so. A new regulator fixed it. 

Good Luck
