They are available, they advertised them at the end of the show. BTW, the
documentary was great. It may rankle some of the diehards (VW <-> Porsche)
but the information appeared accurate--even had a few cameo interview
comments from "The Bruce" himself. The theme of the narration was "Porsche
contribution to automobiles" and the bottom line that one walked away with
was "No Substitute", even if you never heard the phrase. I also sensed that
the conclusion was that when one thinks sports car, one thinks Porsche (see
earlier post on Carvel survey) I began to wonder if everyone making the
film owned Porsches--the writer(s) must certainly have driven a 911. Made
me teary-eyed at the end, so all you guys with slow electric windows,
quityerbitch'in.
