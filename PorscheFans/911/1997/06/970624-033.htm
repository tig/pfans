Your heat controls may be a little different than mine but the problem sounds
the same. Here is what I found. In my 87 Cabrio the heat never went
completely off on the drivers side, even when the red levels were completely
in the down (off) position. The passenger side has not had this problem. This
weekend I was under the car again and noticed that even though the flapper
valve on the outlet of the heat exchanger on the drivers side appeared to be
open (and in fact had plenty of hot air being discharged from it) it was not
completely in the open position. After the engine was shut off an things
cooled down I lubricated the valve ( P B Blaster and CRC) and closed it
completely by hand. It appears that as the valve rotates to open for
exhausting the hot air overboard there is another flap inside that closes off
the air path leading to the vents in the dash.  Right now there is no heat
leaking from any of the vents with the levels in the off position. I'm
enjoyinng it while it lasts.
Good Luck
Jack
