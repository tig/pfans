I also got a similar tip from Performance Aire.  They said to make sure there
isn't any major wiring or other obstruction underneath the passenger kick
panel, since that space is a prime location for installers to hide extra wire. 
I checked mine, and there was some very minimal wiring (for an aftermarket
stereo) but more importantly, I noticed when putting it back together that the
factory carpeting for the passenger footwell has a flap on its far left side
that is tucked *over* this intake gap (left edge of the kick panel nearest the
center of the car) as if they intended to obstruct it in the most effective
possible manner :-).  I folded this carpet flap back underneath the main part
of the carpet, uncovering the intake.  Moving the kick panel itself is another
possibility that should help incrementally.

I haven't noticed a difference, mainly because I am in sore need of a recharge
anyway.
