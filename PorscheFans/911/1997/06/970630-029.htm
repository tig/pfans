They sure seem customer focused.  I ordered info from Titan a while bac=
k, but I
haven't had a chance to use them.  Last week they called me directly to=
 tell me
that their oil analysis services are now offered through AutoZone store=
s,
marketed under the Mobil name.  Then a sample bottle showed up in the m=
ail
(they need 4 oz, sampled hot).

This analysis is about $10, but you don't get all the info the $19 anal=
ysis
gives you.  The expensive analysis gives you wear metals in ppm concent=
rations,
whereas the AutoZone one only gives subjective (acceptable, borderline,=
 and
critical) results.  Both come with a short narrative explaining the dat=
a.  They
keep track of all your previous analyses, and compare them for you.  I =
think
it's nice to be able to follow the wear metal results over time, but I'=
m sure
the $10 analysis is better than nothing.

If you call them, please ask for Mike Paris, the salesman that called m=
e.  I
told him I was going to post the above to the list.  Mike was real help=
ful, and
I'm sure he'd be able to explain the benefits of one analysis over the =
other,
especially given the floaty bits in your oil.

I definitely plan to use them, if I ever get my car running again.

Good luck!
