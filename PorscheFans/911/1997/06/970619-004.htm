Hi p-fans!

I recently aquired a 1987 Cab; this is my 4th 911, yet I am not a=20
gearhead type, I just try to read and learn as much about 911s as I can.

I drove the car through Germany for about 1500 miles last week,=20
in order to find what bugs it may have. The trip was much fun,=20
I was doing 260 kph (160 mph?) twice. (the car is a late 86,=20
G50 gearbox, no cat, 231 hp :^)

I came up with the following observations:

1) The "self-adjusting" cab roof is=B4nt. It was nice and straight when
I got the car. A week later, after driving it on the Autobahn and getting
it wet a few times, it has two creases on both sides, going all the way=20
front to back. Very noisy too, when driving at more than 80 mph; the
side parts above the windows seem to be pulled out by the air flow
outside, resulting in a 120 decibel storm noise next to my left ear.
As this is my first Cabriolet, I have been reading for years about=20
how perfect the 911 Cab is and how little noise it makes (well, in=20
comparison to a coupe, that is) and how waterproof it is etc. Yeah, right.

Q: Is there a way to re-adjust the roof? There are two screws on the side=
s
of the roof, can I open these to reach some adjustment mechanism?

2) When rolling real slow (2-3 mph, like when approaching a stop sign),=20
I hear a rhythmic metallic screeching sound from the front end, in sync=20
with the front wheels. (you might have noticed by now that I am not=20
a native english speaker:^)=20
I have had this sound since the car was lowered (ca. 1 1/4 inches).
I have had the same phenomenon with my previous 88 coupe, again after
having it lowered.=20

Q: Wheel bearings? Brakes? Alignment?=20

Otherwise, I am having a great time after two porscheless years.
I have started using Zym=F6l car care products, thanks for the tip from=20
this list. Amazing stuff, would not use anything else again on a p-car.

Thanks for bearing with me. Happy porsching.
