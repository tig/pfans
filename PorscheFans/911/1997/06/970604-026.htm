I've started my search for my first Porsche 911, having
briefly owned a 944.  Initially I've been targetting
92-93 C2/C4 cars in the $35-40k range.  This will be
a weekend fun car not meant for daily driving.  My
longer term goal is to have this car for 2 to 3 years
and then upgrade to a 95-96 993.  This weekend I test
drove a 94 RS America with 65,000 miles on it that the
owner wanted $36.5 for.  This RS America was not completely
unadorned having stereo, power sunroof, backseats, and a/c.

My questions are:

Which car (C2 or RS America) is generally better resale
wise since I plan to upgrade in 2-3 years.

How much difference does power steering make on this vintage
911 (I assume it's standard on the C2).

Is $36.5 a reasonable price for a RS w/65k on it.  The car
is in very good condition.

What other features am I going to see on a C2 that I would
miss on the RS America.

I liked the 17" 993-style cup wheels on the RS America and
wonder how much trouble it would be to put those on a 92-93
C2.

I plan on driving a C2 to help make my decision but I'd like
to get the opinions of the list.

Thanks for the help.
