Greetings,

1- I am a "neurotic" new Porsche owner '97 911S

2 - Car has 1800 miles - purchased in late April 97

3 - Oil levels always maintained in top three quarters range of "band " on
dipstick
	Initial oil consumption of about 1 QT every 350 miles; consumption has
slowed significantly in the past 400 miles.

5 - oil pressure fine - highway speed at top of gauge range; at idle mid
range; using Mobil 1 10-40. Oil temp also fine ... never more than
midrange; at highway speeds in lower quarter of range.

PROBLEM:

Today, checked oil and found lots of tiny (visible to naked eye but real
small) metal "shavings" on the cloth after wiping dipstick!

Metal shavings were NOT flat flakes; were bright silver in color; were
"little curls" and partially curved in shape.

HELP!!
IS THIS NORMAL????  Given that Porsche says 15K miles before oil change,
something seems wrong to me.  On the obvious question front, Yes, the cloth
was clean when I started; Yes, the car runs just fine otherwise - no
smoking or missing now any strange noises when starting up or running.

*shaking my head* I just cannot believe this amount of metal residue from
manufacture or "break in" is normal.

Many thanks for your thougts,
Michael
