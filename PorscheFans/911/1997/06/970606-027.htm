Pfans,

Another perspective:

I agree the markup in this case seems excessive.

A shop owner I know always tells two stories when you ask for
special consideration:

One guy brought him a camshaft and asked him to install it on
928.  The mechanic agreed to do it but explained he could not
warrantee it.  The guy agreed.  When the camshaft broke he took
a shot and tried to sue.  It cost the mechanic a lot of grief and
two court appearances.

The other story:  He put together two people on a deal because one
had a blown engine and the other had an engine to sell.  All he did
was put them together and he ended up installing the engine.  AS IS.
When the engine broke, the two other parties came up with  a resolution:
The cost of a new engine to be split *3 ways* between them and the mechanic.

The relative percentage of markup issue aside, the mechanic has to
accept a lot of assumed risk AND deal with a lot of pathetic jerks.
Tends to make many of them less flexible.
