Mike,  I bought an '84  930 with 68K miles last fall.  Am attaching a copy
of previous answer I sent to a similar question.  Suggest you have a
pre-sale inspection done.  Mine cost about $200 - consider it insurance.
If your car is not local, strike up a conversation with a respected local
mechanic (recommendations can be gotten from PCA members) who should give
you good free advise with the expectation of future business.  Mine even
looked up a Bosch shop in the other city and spoke to them on my behalf
(while checking out their knowledge) before authorizing the inspection.
Others on this list have had varying degrees of success with pre-sale
inspections - obviously depends on picking the right shop.

   There is nothing like a 911 Turbo, both from the performance and styling
standpoint.  I was new to Porsches -- you have the benefit of previous 911
experience, so know all the typical stuff.  Guess the 930 has even MORE
places for oil to leak from.  Transmission synchros (2nd & 3rd gear) are
often weak.  Even after having mine rebuilt, it's still difficult to get
into 1st gear about 1/2 the time.  Cracked dashboards can be a problem
(mine is in fine shape).  Not sure when the updated timing chain tensioners
became standard, but they are a "must have".  I've had  sportscars all my
life, but nothing as much fun as the 930!!
