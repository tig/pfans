Since I am in the process of installing SSIs on my car, this is all
fresh in my mind. There is indeed an exhaust manifold flange change, but
I don't know what year it took place. The SSIs that I bought for my
Carrera have wide flanges; they are about a half inch thick and each has
a tapered portion of the head pipe that protrudes from the flange about
a quarter inch. Does that even remotely describe those that you have?

You could probably have a good welder create an O2 sensor port. The
trick would be finding or making the female threaded boss that would
need to be welded to the pipe.
