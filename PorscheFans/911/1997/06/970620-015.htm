Hi All,

   I just received my first set of R1s and I remember some comments 
on correct mounting of these tires.  I have the document "A Guide To 
The Use Of BFGoodrich Comp T/A R1 Tires" but it does not go over 
mounting proceedures.  Other than the obvious usual safety 
precautions and mounting the correct side out are there any other 
special guidelines?  I seem to remember mention of lining up a 
certain dot on the tire with the valve stem.

   The recent discussion of tire inflation with nitrogen is 
interesting as I had never thought about this issue.  I am in a 
somewhat unique position as a Dentist in that I have access to some 
tools not usually found in the average home mechanic's shop.  My air 
compressor is a retired dental unit equipped with a dessicator and it 
delivers DRY air.  I also have a vacuum pump that makes breaking tire 
beads easy and will allow evacuating the tire of most of the moist 
air present when the tire is mounted.  This brings up a question on 
the use of the nitrogen by race teams, how do they get rid of the 
moist air present in the tire when it is mounted?  Or is this not 
enough of an issue?

Thanks,
Robin
