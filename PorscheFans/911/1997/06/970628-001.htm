I sent a private msg to Tony Staples, who asked, but more would
probably benefit so here goes.  The best deal on Optima batteries
TTBOMK is Chatham Motorsports, which runs a small classified ad in
Pano (see under "Stop battery damage").  Their price is $125 incl
shipping, plus $5 west of Miss.  List is $139, and Alan Johnson (whom
I called for comparison) charges that.  Automotion has the same
battery, which they call something else, and the price is around
there, if not more.

Anyway, the address is 225 N. Maple, Vinton, VA 24179,
ph. 540-981-0356.  No cards, no fax, but they'll send on your say-so
and say they've never had trouble with bounced checks from Porsche
people.  They give prompt service--I had mine within a week or so.

If you've never installed an Optima before, you'll need an adapter
tray.  My previous one lasted 5 years (out of the warranteed 7) in a
car which was seldom used for much of the time.  Best I've ever had,
and no worries about acid in the trunk.
