Nill,

This question has the potential to fuel a nice debate...I'm just waiting for
Harley's salvo on the question and answers!

I looked at both Cabs and Targas when I went looking for my 911.  Because I
live in San Diego where it's almost always sunny and hardly ever rains I
wanted the open top.  The Targa is a great concept but I've always thought
that with the tops on/up, the Targa didn't have the nice classic lines of the
911, for some reason to me the Cabriolets just look better.  And there's just
something "perfect" about cruising around with a fully open top on a sunny
day.

Just one small complaint: putting down the top isn't the most convenient thing
to do on a Cab.  I've seen Miata drivers do it in traffic in stop-and-go
driving down the highway.  We have to turn off the engine, wait for the motor
to retract the top, then get out of the car, get the boot out of the luggage
compartment and button it up.  I'm not really complaining since it's all worth
it in the end, but I wish it were a little easier. I don't remember the full
process on a Targa. Does the top store conveniently somewhere?

As for security, I installed a dual zone radar alarm and I just won't store
anything of value in the car in hopes that no one will ever feel the need to
cut the top.  Since breaking in thru the door lock is so easy anyway, no car
is a very effective safe.  And if someone were out to steal the car, I would
think they would punch the lock instead of cutting the roof.  So I don't think
the security issue is a very meaningful argument against the Cab.

If I were living somewhere that had a real winter or lots of cloudy days and
rain I might be tempted to go the Targa route. But here in SD there's no
question, totally topless in a Cab is the way to go.

Paul
