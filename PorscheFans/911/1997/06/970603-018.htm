hello to all,

	as a recent owner of a 1993 RSAmerica i have been noticing a
problem with the clutch. the car has 57,000miles and is completely stock.
the clutch had some hydraulic problems when it came out of storage after
the winter, but the hydraulic fluid was changed and the problem was cured.
now every time when i downshift from say fifth to fourth, or third to
second, it is "sticking", and requires some effort to pull the shift lever
out of gear. there are no problems howeverwhen shifting up through the
gears. are there any suggestions for this type of problem.

	second, the car is completely stock, other than a K&N filter, i am
interested in the future in putting in a chip(auto-thority) and a
free-flowing exaust(Tri-flow). are these the "best" per say solutions for
some added horsepower? thanks for your time.

Ross Drenning
