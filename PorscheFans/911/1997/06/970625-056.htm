If you've got the dollars for a 993 and you want open air motoring, the
classic lines of the new Targa are simply breath-taking.  It also retains
the structural rigidity (and weight?) to make it a potential weekend racer.
 I agree that ealier Targa's have a flat roof -- which some like, but I
prefer the coupe's smooth lines.

Of course the 993 Cab is just plain drop dead georgous, but it's less
purposeful as a performance car and with the bulk of the roof above the
body line, it doesn't have the same completely open feel as some purpose
built convertible designs.

I wish there was a C4 or C4S cabrio or a TT cab.
