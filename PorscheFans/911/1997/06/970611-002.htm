Are there any 911 jack pads that are of better quality than the rest?  The
one I have (steel bar with disk welded on the end) has started to bend after
a few uses, especially where the disk sits into the floor jack.  Mine in
constructed of cheap ($2.00/ lb) 1018 steel........I'm looking for one made
of 4130 stainless, hopefully hardened to a 35-40 HRc.  I don't want to
damage a nice car because of the failure of a cheap tool.
Also, has anyone adapted one of these jack pads to work with a single acting
hydraulic ram?  I've got an Enerpac 10ton (10" travel) ram which inserts
into a 9"x9" base plate (for stability) and attaches to a 18 lb battery
powered hydraulic pump via hose (3' or 6') & quick disconnect.  This setup
(weighs 30 lbs and fits in a milk crate sized box) could quickly raise the
car via jack pad without having to lug a 90 lb floor jack around to track
events.  A user operated check valve would provide a hydraulic lock while
the pump is off or if the hose were disconnected to prevent collapse of the
cylinder.  This general setup has been engineered for rail cars weighing up
to 100 tons....should be safe for a 3000 lb car.    SD
