Charlie,

No. 4 measures the oil level in the oil storage tank in the right-rear
fender.

Dry sump system operates by having oil tank/supply external to engine.
There are essentially two oil pumps in the car; one that picks up oil in
the oil tank and pressurizes it for engine oiling, a second one that picks
up the return oil in the engine sump and sends it to the oil coolers and
tank.  So, you essentially have two oil levels; one in the sump and one in 
the oil tank.  The pressure/flow characteristics of the oil pumps are
such that at higher engine speeds relatively more oil is in the sump, so
the level in the tank goes down.  

Level is lower at colder temperatures due to thermal expansion of the oil
(given mass quantity takes up more space at it heats up).

If the oil level gauge is reading in the non-red zone with the engine  warmed
up and idling, oil level os probably OK.  Recommend to also check the 
oil dipstick for confirmation; gauge is not entirely accurate.  At colder
oil temperatures and higher engine speed the oil level will drop; perfectly
normal to have gauge be in red under these conditions.

(reply to):

While I'm on the subject of oil, I guess I just don't understand how the
dry sump oil system works. My dash board has four gizmos for telling me
about my oil:

1.	The "Druck Press" oil pressure gauge.
2.	The oil temperature gauge.
3.	The oil level warning light which never comes on (thank God).
4.	The "Oil" gauge.

But #4 is mysterious to me. It's always in the red when I'm driving and
sometimes when I'm stopped (particularly when the engine's cold).  What
is this things supposed to be telling me and what should I do when it
does tell me something?

Thanks in advance.
