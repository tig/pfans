They arent all that hard to rebuild. First step is to remove the axles,
major watch out is that the in hex socket (or allen key or whatever you
call them) goes all the way to the bottom of the socket head bolts
holding the axles to the transmission and outer axle. Use a small blade
screwd driver to clean the crud out of the inhex and then use a small
hammer to tap the in hex into the socket head screw.

Once the axle is out, all you do is remove the circlip on the outer end
of the axle. This will let the CV slide off, albeit with a bit of rubber
hammer persuasion. If you then rotate the inner part of the joint, the
balls will begin to fall out and with little fiddling you will end up
with the outer race, cage, inner race and the balls. There is a school
of thought which suggests that you want the balls to all end up in their
original locations, I have done it both ways and can't tell the
difference, so now I am of the belief it doesn't matter.
Clean it all with solvent, measure out 70grams of good CV joint grease
(understand Swepco is good) and reassemble. I would do one dry run with
the joint un greased so that you can figure out how to get it
together....not hard, but it makes sense after a while.
Make sure to check for cracked cages or damaged balls or races. Any
visible damage means you need a new CV.
You do need new gaskets and if your rubbers are damaged, those need to
be replaced as well.
A bit messy, but about 1 hour per side is all you need.
