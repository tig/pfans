You are one lucky guy to catch that in time...sounds like your pivot
pin was starting to back itself out (that happened to me --twice). As
far as sources, the pivot pins aren't that expensive, and I'd
personally feel safer with one from a dealer, because they also tend
to snap. Have you investigated whether you can switch to the later
clutch mechanism. That pivot pin setup was just a hare-brained idea
to begin with. Finally, when you get it all back together, I found
that my clutch didn't really work well until I adjusted the cable at
the pedal end (rather than at the transmission) it sounds
counterintuitve, but it worked for me.
