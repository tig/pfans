Thanks to all for the excellent suggestion of pulling the wiper fuse
when at the track. For the other three guys who havn't yet heard of this
solution, I enclose a typical answer, this one from Paul Lyman:

  This is quite common!  I occasionally autox (I don't do the big tracks
because I can't afford a shunt -- I think you will empathisize! ;-). 
After
the first couple of times, I now always pull the horn relay and the
wiper
fuse.

   And it is not just me.  I recall reading in Panorama about one of the
Porsche 917's at Le Mans (I think).  The story went something like: it
unexpectedly started to rain, and the crew chief looked sadly at his
assistant, and slowly fished the windshield wiper fuse out of his
pocket!

HTH,
