I just changed my deck lid shocks this week and had the same experience.
The right strut installed with no problem. The left was another story.
After an hour or so of attempting to solve the problem with an
assortment of magnetic reach extenders and surgical tools, the only
result was a right hand with several scraped knuckles. When my level of
exasperation was just about into the red zone, the solution pulled up
the driveway; my lovely wife. I explained the mechanics, held the
flashlight as directed and watched as she deftly installed the rear pin
and clip with her much smaller and delicate hands. She turned and gave
me that "what's the big deal?" look and continued on into the house. 
Once more, humbled by the obvious.
