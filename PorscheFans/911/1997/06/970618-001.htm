Hey P-Friends, 

I am looking for a set of seatbelts for the rear jump seats in my 84 Targa.
The PO took one set out for some reason and was never able to locate them for
me. I need the set for just one seat (drivers side rear) but will take both
so they match if need be. I don't think there is any difference in drivers or
passenger side.  I can't pass inspection in VA without them (if the notice
it's missing), and the time is coming up.

I also have  a set of two rear side panels for a 74'  911. They're black
vinyl and in excellent shape. There the panels that fit beside the rear seats
under the window and the seatbelt retractors for the front fit behind them.
 They have no ripes or discoloration. if anyone is interested in them I'll
let them go for a very reasonable  amount. I don't need them at all so there
just sitting here gathering dust. 

TIA, 

Dan O.
