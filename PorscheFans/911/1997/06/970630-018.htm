What's the reputation of Robert Wood, Inc (the company)?   What about
Wheel
Enhancement (now owned by Robert Wood)?  Which gives better
service?  Who's
tech advice do you trust more? 
________________________________________________
I have dealt extensively with Greg Wood at Robert Wood, Inc. (used to
be Robert's company until his brother Greg bought it from him -
confusing, eh?!) and recommend Greg very highly.  He's very
knowledgable, and extremely fair and honorable in his dealings.  Others I
have recommended to him have had the same reaction.  As for Robert
Wood at Wheel Enhancement, I have no personal experience with him,
but I have heard good things from others on the Pfans list.


Also, can anyone recommend a top notch audio shop in L.A. with 911
upgrade
experience?

Check out Paris Audio in West L.A., near the intersection of Sepulveda
and Olympic (not the same Paris Audio stereo chain that existed in L.A.
some years ago).  These guys are artistes, with prices to match.  But if
you want top quality stuff with even higher quality installation, I think you
should talk to them.
