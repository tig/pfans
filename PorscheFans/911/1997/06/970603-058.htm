Hi Adam...  Can you tell me a little about that pipe that replaced the 
blower?

I have a 77s with a 3.6 C2 motor, and I removed the blower.  I have the 
hole where the plastic pipe and blower went blocked up with a piece of 
plastic...

Thanks,

Dave

the hood is to replace the heater/blower unit with a simple, factory, 
plastic pipe that runs from the fan.  It gives the engine bay a clean 
appearance and reduces another few pounds of junk that's just not needed at 
the rear of the car.
