Steve Miller wrote with some concerns about the manual shifting in a Boxster. 

IMHO, the lack of "stick" shift IS a disadvantage, since in tight fast 
maneuvering it can be hard to find the buttons, and to figure out which way is 
"up".

There is another disadvantage with the buttons - they are easy to hit 
accidentally when performing tight fast turns in motorkhana events, resulting 
in an unwanted gear change.

However, don't condemn the Tiptronic on this basis.  For motorkhana events I 
have learned to put the stick in "1" or "2" position.  If the course is really 
slow, then locking into "1" is VERY good.  For faster events, where there is a 
need to switch between 1 and 2 (or even 3), then the computer does an 
excellent job of shifting for you based on your input through the throttle.

On upshifts you never waste time hitting the rev limiter, and downshifts you 
control with the right foot, helped by the proactive nature of the computer.

NO REGRETS!  My wife and I both compete, and would not move back to manual.  
But we are not playing for sheep stations (cattle ranches?), just for fun.
