Subject:: Air Conditioning System Leaks

On this subject, a co-worker recommended a commercially-available air 
conditioning system leak sealant that is injected into the compressor inlet 
valve.  He said that this has been a successful remedy for several domestic 
and import vehicles suffering this same malady. 

Any PCar experiences that PFans wish to share?  My SO is getting a bit 
warm.

Thanks!

Subject: 911 Air Conditioning System Leaks

Do the PFans have any suggestions on suspect Freon leakage areas in the 911 
('83SC)?  I bought the car in May '94 and had the system charged July '94.  
And while I never got great volumes of air afterwards, at least it was 
cold.  I followed the advice to turn the system on for several minutes each 
month over the winter.  The system was still functioning reasonably well in 
'95.

I had the system recharged/reoiled in May '96 as the air flowing from the 
vents was ambient temperature and engaging the compressor was inducing no 
discernible drag.  With the price of Freon escalating past extortionate 
rates, I hoped that this would last for awhile.  Again, I ran the 
compressor once a month over the winter.

Firing-up the system at the behest of my SO last week, I discovered the 
charge was once again gone.

My pocketbook nor the ozone layer can tolerate this any longer.  The auto 
air-conditioning "experts" in my area are not familiar with PCars and the 
dealers generally farm-out the work to these same "experts".

Any suggestions as to where to begin to direct the sniffing wand to uncover 
the breach?  And are there any chronically weak areas in the system?  The 
compressor is the original York and no other changes to the stock system 
have been made as far as I can ascertain.

Thanks!
