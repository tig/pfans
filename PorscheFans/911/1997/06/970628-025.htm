I have just relocated to Charlotte and I am curious if anyone can recommend a 
good repair shop.  I don't have a need yet, however, it would be nice to be
prepared.

Also,  I saw the posting (and responses) to Jerry Mouton's questions on
installing
new Koni struts on his '85 Carrera.  I have a '69 T which has a set of
Bilsteins on the 
front which are in need of replacement.  Couple of questions are:
        1.  Do I replace with a set of inserts? or does the entire assembly
have to be
        taken off?
        2.  What is the degree of difficulty/process?  I'm not overly
skilled with
        a wrench, but it does not seem to be out of my league.
        3.  Recently put a set of Koni's on the rear....is it ok to mix and
        match or should I replace the front struts with Koni's.

If anyone can render assistance I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks,
