I recently (1 week ago) purchased my first Porsche- a 1990 black/black C2.
One of the first things that I would like to do to the car is upgrade from
the stock 16" 7 spoke style wheels to the 17" C2 turbo 5 spoke style wheels.
I apologize if this has been a thread of discussion previously. I tried to
dig into the archives but it was fruitless with no search vehicle. I've been
looking at the Tire Rack ads advertising Borbett C2 turbo knock offs (as well
as other repro brands).
1) Anything glaringly wrong with the imitations (offset?)? Any
thoughts/preferences? I won't be doing any track time- just pleasure (Oh...
what pleasure) but will probably drive it fairly hard.
2) My current tires are 205 and 255 width 16" tires and the 17" C2T's are
also 205 and 255. I would have thought that the tire width would have
increased going to a larger wheel, but apparently this is not so. Considering
the aggresive look of the 930's with the wide tires, can I mount wider tires
on the C2T wheels? Or am I better off staying with the recommended 205/50-17
and 255/40-17? Can the wheel wells accomodate wider tires?
3) Will the 17" tires create a much harsher ride quality? 
4) The PO ran BFGoodrich Comp T/A VR4 tires and very much liked them- not so
much performance oriented (V rated) however he was pleased with wet
weather/all season performance, longevity, price, and ride quality. Going to
the 17" tires, is there a comparable tire anyone's pleased with? Any
suggestions?
5) Has anyone done this that could give me some pros/cons?

Thanking you all in advance,
