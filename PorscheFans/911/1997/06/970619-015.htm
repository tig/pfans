Well, this subject comes up with some regularity, but at least you read
the owners manual...  However, you missed the caveat at the bottom of
the page.  The manual states that "under normal conditions" an interval
of 15K/12months is appropriate, BUT vehicles operated under "severe"
conditions should be serviced more frequently.  The definition of "severe"
is something like "stop-and-go traffic, frequent short trips, extremes
of temperature, dusty or dirty environments", etc.

Having said that, (and noting that I don't track this car) I use an
interval of 6 months or 7500 miles.  That works out pretty well for me,
as I usually only put 5K - 7.5K per summer on the car (and it is stored
for the Minnesota winter from November to April...).
