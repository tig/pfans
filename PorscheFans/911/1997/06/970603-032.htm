Mack-
Yes there are a lot of 911/993 choices... my advice to you (being new to
Porsche) is to buy the newest car that you can afford.  Aftermarket products
can be installed successfully on any and all Porsche models.  C4's handle
better in the rain and hook up better than C2's, but the engines and
transmissions are very different from each other, and the C4's are more
expensive to work on.  If you are a driving enthusiast the 5 or 6 speed
manual transmission would probably suit you better.  If you have any
questions or would like to discuss this in depth with someone feel free to
give me a call.  I do auto locating and brokering and I specialize in Porsche
and Mercedes-Benz.  If you were interested I could even find you whatever you
are looking for at a considerable savings to you (I have an eye for deals).
 BTW, there is a doctor here in town that has a 1990 Carrera 4 Targa that he
is selling.  I know you don't really like the Targas, but this one has many
mods done to it.  Before he even saw the car (after buying it new) it was
sent to Munich, Germany to the Strosek shop where a body kit (without the
hideous small, round headlights), Strosek suspension and exhaust upgrades, a
Strosek RSR computer, and custom made 3-piece rims and tires were added.  The
car sounds great, runs extremely well, and is in perfect mechanical shape.
 It does need a good wash though.  The top half of the engine was just
rebuilt and a new clutch installed.  I can get you more info on the car if
you are interested, and like I said, call me if you want.  It's hard to type
good info back to someone.  Conversations are much more personal as well!
