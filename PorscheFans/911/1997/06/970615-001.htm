Scott:
	I would call the DA in indianapolis as this person is commiting fraud,
if in fact as you state he was informed a week earlier that he is
misrepresenting the car. I would take him to small claims court to get
your $2000 back, thats enough money to go after, maybe the PCA club
there would help you get the papers ect.  You should also call Pano and
get the ad pulled.  I would write him a letter letting him know that you
will procede with the DA to prosecute him crimminally which carries
punative damages well in excess of $2000 and that you have a witness who
told him he was misrepresenting the car a week before - this may make
him interested in giving up the money.  

Good luck.
