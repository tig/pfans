Hi Frederick W. Emmerich - on 25 Dec 96, talking about "Software", you

I know I have taken a *long* time to reply (I am *very* far behind on some
of my 911 mail!!), but I have been using a shareware DOS product called
C.A.R. (Chris's Automobile Recorder), produced by Cooney Applied Technology
for about 5 years now. It's not perfect, but I haven't been able to find
anything better :-(  You should be able to find a copy by using Alta Vista
or similar to search for C.A.R. (or for ASP - Association of Shareware
Professionals). 

There was also a company who advertised a DOS program in Panorama a few
years ago - don't know if they are still going (I don't get Pano).

There is also a program produced by Car Fleet Control (Web page is
http://www.carfleetcontrol.co.uk I think), but it is designed for fleets
of 25 or more vehicles and is priced accordingly!

Did you find anything else in your search? I'm always looking for
something better than C.A.R. to use!
