P-Fans,

  I too have had a bad case of foggy gauges on my '87 911.  I took the
car to a local Speedo Shop and was told that it would be about $30 ea to
have the inside of the gauges cleaned.  Anyone have any experience in 
taking one of these gauges apart?  I'm considering doing it myself, since
there is no promise that it will not fog again.

  Anyone have experience with Nology Wires?  I've been hearing quite a bit
about them and wonder if there is a benefit.  My understanding is that they
recommend use with Non-resistor plugs.  Any harm in doing this?

  While I was at the speedo shop, I had mine checked.  Seems to be about 
5 mph optimistic at 65mph.  Is this normal?  I saw an article in Car&Driver
where they had a new Turbo S and it was reading as much as 19mph over.  (of
course they were doing 180 at the time.)  They said that the unit might be
calibrated, but didn't seem to know exactly how.

Later'
