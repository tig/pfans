>My '68 911T which has the most basic heating system; you pull the little

Not necessarily but easy to check.

>Can anyone tell me
>a) how the general heating process is supposed to work?
The  exhaust pipes passing through the airbox/heat exchanger heats the air.
The heated air enters the car via a hose leading from the front top of 
the heat
exchanger.   When the red lever between the seats is down, a little door
is left open in the inlet vent where the hose connects and the heat is vented
to the outside.  When the lever is up, a cable pulls the door closed 
and the heated
air enters the car.  You can see this if you get under the car (supported by
jackstands, of course) and take a gander at the front top of the heat 
exchanger.

b) what should I be looking to fix?

Given the above, check for leaky/missing hose.  Replacement flexible wire-bound
Loprene hose is about $10 from GPR.   I had to trim it to fit my car.
Also, check for the door rusted in the open position.  There is a 
return spring
also.   The cable may have snapped off the door or need adjusting.

>c) can one clear the vent ways? the dash on the drivers side doesn't

Doubt that it's clogged but it would be difficult but I guess you could
use a plumber's snake to make sure it's not blocked.

Hope this helps,
