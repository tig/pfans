Yestrday, as I was driving home on my 1987 911 Coupe (108000 miles), I
had a serious problem in engaging the gears. As I drive it, it is
sometimes, almost impossible to put into gear. Additionally, there is a
clunking noice as I drive and when I engage the gears. Also when I start
from a stopped position. I have a Limited Slip Differential in the car.

Promptly, I took it to my mechanic to find out the problem. My initial
guess was that I needed a new clutch but after driving the car he though
that it might be either the linkages or the transmission mounts.

Well, today after a couple of labor hours, he tells me that my
transmission is screwed up and I will need a new one. He adviced me to
purchase a used one over re-building it since it may reduce my costs. He
had the car on the rack and tried to move the rear wheels slightly back
and forth and there is a definite and noticeble clunk from the
transmission.

What should I do ? Get a second opinion or believe what he says ?

Thanks
