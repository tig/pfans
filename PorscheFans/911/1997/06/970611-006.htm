Hi David,
   I've used this answer before and it is still valid.
   I make the Brey-Krause stuff.  You should know that up 
front.
   Whatever you do, remember that the strut tops need to pivot 
in their mounts.  If you try to "freeze" the tops of the struts 
they will bind, bend, or break.  This is not an opinion, it is 
fact.  You don't have to be an engineer to see it if you look.
   The best setup, if you really need it, is a monoball type 
top mount combined with a simple bar which keeps the tops of 
the towers aligned.  Both pieces are made by several people.  
If you need reccomdations/more info, e-mail me.
   There is alot of hokum (Bruce A. has another word) out there
so beware. If you are not using sticky tires/stiff struts and 
really pushing your car, you probably don't really need anything.
   This is especially true in the torsion bar cars where most 
of the load is carried lower in the chassis.

Good Luck,
Dodge
