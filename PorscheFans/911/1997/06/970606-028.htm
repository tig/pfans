I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my plea for help regarding my C4's ABS & 4WD warning lights. It seems that a few other C4 owners have had or are having the same problem. I though I'd summarize the list of advice I received.

	Non-standard size road wheels may be out side the adjustment range for 		the ABS/4WD system. The manual states the the system can adjust for 		other sizes but only up to a certain limit.

	Brake fluid reservoir not filled to "Max" level. 

	ABS pump, pressure switch or pressure sensor failure. Only sure way to
	isolate is to use pressure gauge to determine fault. 
	
In my case adding a little more fluid (above the Max line) seemed to help a little. But only temporarily. The lights went off for two day (and ten miles) but came back on the next morning. They have been on ever since. The brake fluid level is fine (a little above Max). I've noticed my ABS pump seems to be operating all the time. I do not hear it build pressure and then switch off.

ANOTHER PROBLEM:

Believe it or not I am getting some other warning light occasionally. Most of the time every thing is fine (other than the ABS/4WD lights). However, sometimes
every warning light in the oil gauge, tach and speedo are lit solid with the audible alarm going off. This has happen on its own when the car is hot from being parked in the sun. After driving a few minutes this might happen. I can force this to happen almost all the time by turning on the lights. The only way to clear the lights is to restart the car. Toggling the "cancel" button does nothing (audible alarm keeps going off). After I restart the car if I turn on 
the lights it will happen within a few seconds. Needless to sat driving at night is out of the question.

Something that I think might be relate is a crackling noise I get from the radio. This couples directly to the engine rpms. It's extremely loud, only a few DB less than the music. It sounds like the spark boxes are playing on my radio. This noise only appeared around the same time the Christmas tree warning lights started to play. 

I can not be sure but I think all this started to occur after I had the valves adjusted. When I picked up the car I noticed the radio noise. I don't remember having the warning light problem before that. I've looked for disconnected ground straps and such but have found nothing. My mechanic has checked it out but hasn't isolated the problem. The hammer did indicate a short. I've had this problem since last fall.

I notice that a Porsche bulletin stated that a faulty secondary ignition could
cause false warning lights. Excuse my ignorance but what is the secondary ignition. Are they referring the the ignition coil. Does anybody know where the secondary ignition is located, what does it look like, and how can I determine if it is faulty?

Lastly, my car suffers from poor low speed drive-ability (what a surprise). I always suspected that the car had an after market chip. My mechanic confirmed this when he used the Hammer to diagnose my problems. Porsche does not sell replacement chips. They will sell me a DME! Does anybody know of a source where I can get the factory chip?

Thanks for any help.

PS> I did have the car checkout before I bought it. I was running fine then.
    All these problem have occured in the last year.
