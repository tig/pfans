My 1970 911T has an aftermarket RS mirror from the early 70's , it's
chipped and corroded and I want to replace it. In looking at  911s from the
same era I see a few that have square , chrome mirrors and some have round
, chrome mirrors. I want to replace the mirror with as stock as possible.
69 to 73 road and track magazines I have seen show the round one, as does a
71 sales brochure I picked up at a swap meet. In a March 69 Car and Driver
I found all 4 1969 models were tracked side by side, T,E, S and the 912 and
in the photo all have round mirrors. I ask because a friend's 69 911S has a
square one.

What's my best choice and approach to getting a stock mirror and where do
the square one's come from?

Right side mirrors appear to have been a uncommon option. I see the bolt
holes inside the door panel, Are right side mirrors available and if so in
a convex format so I can see better?

I'll be in the SF area in two weeks so I plan to drop by Parts Haven but I
want to know what to look for in advance.
