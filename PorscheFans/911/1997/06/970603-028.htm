I took my 87 Carrera back to the shop the check on the alignment. The car
had been lowered (as far as it went without taking the torsion bars out)
and the camber was set to -.75, which I guess was responsible for wearing
the inside of the front tires considerably after only 5000 miles. The shop
said that there was no further adjustment that could be done to reduce the
camber setting, other than raising the car. They ended up elongating the
adjustment holes where the shocks attach and moved them all the way out,
and changed the caster from 5 to 4 and got -.5 degrees on one of the wheels
but the other one remained close to -1!!

Does anyone have any ideas of might be happening here? I can't imagine the
911 cannot be adjusted properly when lowered without the addition of
expensive camber plates! I am supposed to take it back to the shop on
thursday, since they left the camber setting at different values for both
wheels and I want them to set them equally. Before (and after) these
adjustments the car was pulling to the left. Should I have them raise the
car a little so that they can get -.5 degrees of camber?


Thanks,


Gabriel
