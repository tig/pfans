I've got a '89 C4 with automatic climate control.  My problem is that the
heat never seems to go completely off.  The heat definitely comes on stronger
as I increase the temp. dial, but never seems to go completely off even with
the dial fully counterclockwise.  I have AC, which seems to work, but once
the engine gets warm I only get warm air.  I assume that there is some valve
or flapper that is causing the problem.  I have checked the temp sensor on
the air duct to the left of the engine and it seems OK.  Any ideas?

Is there any service manual short of the official Porshe manual that anyone
could recommend?  I would like to do routine maintenance myself, but don't
want to buy the $300+ set if I don't have to.

Thanks,
Tad
