Ah yes an old wound or wart has reappeared! In the resto biz I too have 
needed/requested by customer new leather. My dealings with AGLA
were with dashboards for a 928 and 911's. The 928 fiasco started
with" send me your pad and it will be covererd and shipped back
promptly". Yeah right! After numerous phone calls with even his answering
machine promising me that the dash has been shipped, I often wondered
what other callers thought when they heard this on his machine. As i 
was really losing face to my customer, offering him the phone #, hearing
the same blah,blah,blah and yes Series 900 your dash has been 
shipped. Customer started to believe me yet still was pissed. When 
finally a pad arrived, guess what, it wasnt even the same one. Not
even the same year. Didnt fit, it was dented in the center, had to get
different defrost vents. It sucked, He's in Fla and your not. I lost a
 a local customer and any referalls for future biz.

Round 2: customer request for recover on tan dashpad. Warn customer.
Open line of communication with AGLA, explain last deal, told that was
"over". OK I will bite, customer says" send a finished product and we will
send back core".  We get the pad, assemble car, leather is to short
next to glass. Explain to AGLA, send core, do not see a return. F#@%er
after much harassment and 2months a pad arrives. Call customer, he 
picks it up, pissed never hear from him again. So the lost core disease
seems to be an AGLA phenomenon generated internally, then spread
to installers, which in turn perpetuates to more lost cores, more pissed
off customers/installers etc. So beware the AGLA VIRUS

I have not done any further business w/ AGLA. When asked I will 
not get involved in that part of the project. Period. I mean it.
However, I will send a copy of Email w/permission to both of these
p-ple as a postscript.End of story. period. I mean it! And if anything 
has changed in that operation and somebody has good results, let 
us know. If the disease continues, please warn others.
