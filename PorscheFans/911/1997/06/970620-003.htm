Brian,

Sounds like your on your way to getting the problem 'licked!'.  I don't
mind you sending mail to my address at all...One must always take time out
to talk about Porsches each and every day...it's all part of owning one!

I've never had to go that route, so I'm totally unfamiliar with that one. 
Sorry.

I know the windshield wiper pump is in the front of the boot, just in front
of the battery, you will see the hoses going to it, as far as the headlight
washers, I'm not sure if they run off of the same pump.  If you don't see
another one in the boot, then I would think both systems use the same
pump--shouldn't be hard to find.

I know what you mean.  It's unnerving at times, however, if a little bit of
time goes by you'll slowly start to enjoy that car again and forget about
such an incidental little problem.  Sounds like the failure to park is
either in the wiper stalk contacts or the motor.  The really only screws up
when you try to use it:  It either causes the wipers to be intermittent or
not.  When you park your wipers, they usually don't park in the right
place...other systems would suggest that it probably isn't the relay, but
the stalk or the motor contacts.  Hope you get the help you need, this is a
great resource!

Joe
