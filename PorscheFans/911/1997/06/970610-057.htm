Hello Porschephiles,

So, I embarked on my first brake job on my 87 911. With new pads in hand,
off came the tires & calipers. Then, on to the rotors. As soon as they came
off, down they went to Chiefs for a turn-job.
Surprise # 1: rotors were below specs, needed to be replaced; Spend til
Monday to get new ones.
Surprise # 2: Took a closer look at calipers; rubber boots were
disintegrated! Another
day of waiting for replacement parts.

Man, all I wanted to do was put new pads on!

FINALLY! all parts are in and everything is put back together.
Bleeding the system, ALL DONE! 

Or am I?

Here's were Murphy hit hardest. Considering that my rotors were shot, I
think it was
no wonder that I had to put a lot of effort into braking. Brakes also faded
quickly and
locked up quickly.

Now, that virutally everything is new on the front, braking seems soft. The
car
stops quickly and there is no locking-up, but the brake pedal seems to have
too much travel and the brakes just appear not right.

Am I just not used to "new brakes" and think they should feel the same way
my
bad ones felt? Is it "normal" for my brakes to feel a bit soft? Braking is
there, I am
just a bit nervous about it.

What is your opinion?
Any helpful tips would be appreciated.

P.S. theoretical question. Does it matter which caliper goes on which side
of the fron axle?  They both seem identical; the only difference would be
the location of the bleed nipple (top or bottom of caliper). Just
wondering.

Thanks,

Darrel
