I'm very happy with the results I got when I refinished mine, though. I
followed (pretty much) Larry Reynolds' instructions, using Wurth products.
I sanded a fair amount but didn't do any stripping. It can be tricky to get
a finish that's both smooth and drip-free (at least for a first-time
painter like myself) but it's definitely possible to produce excellent
quality results in your garage.

I'd say there are two keys to getting acceptable results (ignoring the
specifics of varying paint brands):

1) Spend as much time as it takes to mask the wheels perfectly. Use the
right kind of tape (I used some thin, flexible blue 3M tape) for the edge
of the black and you'll get a razor-sharp, smooth paint line.

2) Practice with the spray can to figure out just how to avoid getting
heavy orange peel or other textures while also dodging drips. Maybe there's
a good technique that a real painter can explain, or maybe it's just very
tough to figure out that balance with a spray can. You'll save yourself a
lot of frustration, though, even if it means you have to use an entire can
for practice!
