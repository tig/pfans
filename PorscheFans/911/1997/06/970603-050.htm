Having lurked on this list, read the FAQ and slogged thru several months
worth of the archives without success, I submit the following request for
guidance to the resident 911 gurus. Please excuse the repetition if the
subject has been covered previously.  

After having Porsches in my family since the late 50s (Dad was an engineer
and admired their design), I finally succumbed to the disease and bought my
first one a month ago.  Since I am far from wealthy, it is a 30-year old
911S which is in excellent shape, but fairly cobbled up with later model
"updates" by POs (making it accessibly *cheap*).

The car has 107K miles on it and runs great.  I noticed a slight vibration
feeding back thru the steering wheel at about 70 mph, though, so I took it
in to get the wheels spin-balanced (they're the S-mag 6x15 alloys).  Two of
the rims were bent, according to the tire shop, and when I watched them
spin on the balance machine, I could see that they did display about a
1/4"+ of "runout".  Is this the likely source of the slight wobble, or
should I be looking at tie rod ends and ball joints, etc.?  Can the rims be
"trued" or do I just live with it?  It's not that bad, seeming to come and
go depending on the road surface, and I don't see any sign of abnormal tire
wear.  I don't plan on racing the car, it's just a fun Sunday driver.

If I do replace them, what are the maximum size rims and tires I can fit?
This car has the later model ('69-'71?) fenders with the small flares, not
the stock '67 ones. I don't think the rims are stock, either, since they
have a black web between the spokes, and I don't remember that from my
father's '67S (I remember them being all silver).

Thanks in advance for any advice.  I have zillions of more questions I'd
like to pose to the aggregate brainpower and experience of this list (what
a resource!), but I've taken up enough bandwidth with this first one.  Best
to not be too greedy!
