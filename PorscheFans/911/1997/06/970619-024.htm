     Hi Steve,
     
     I noticed no one replied.  I just had mine replaced this week.  It's a 
     '82 targa.  The material was peeling off and starting to decompose, 
     dropping little bits of stuff on the engine.  I let the dealer do it, 
     since it was in for a clutch.  I asked previously and they didn't 
     recommend trying to replace it without the engine out.  I considered 
     just getting some gooky glue to paste it back up, but then I don't 
     want to start hacking at this great car.  Cost was about $70 for the 
     pad and $40 labor.  I don't notice any difference in sound deadening, 
     since I've got a Bursch exhaust and sport muffler.  But I wanted it 
     repaired properly since I don't like to carry broken or "out of spec" 
     stuff on the car.
     
     Roland

The insulation/sound deadening stuff in my 911SC's engine compartment is on 
its last legs. I think it's missing in some places, and it's certainly 
falling off in the rest. Should I just remove it altogether or is it worth 
replacing?
