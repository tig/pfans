I agree whole heartedly.  I think this is one reason the same questions keep 
coming up.

Subject: 	Porsche Mail List Replies - Go Public!!

A non car subject, forgive me...
   One of the great things about mail lists is the ability to send & read a
variety of interesting questions, and then watch expert, informed,
conflicting, (or sometimes just plain wrong) answers get posted.  The
resulting interchange is a learning experience for everyone on the list,
thus enhancing the general knowledge base.
   As a relatively new P owner, I have lurked in the shadows, occasionally
asked my share of dumb questions, and even provided a few correct (I hope)
answers.  However, the 911 list exhibits a disturbing trend.  Many
questions are posted, but VERY FEW public answers are provided.   Rather
answers are sent directly to the originator as private e-mail (valuable
answers, I might add)..  Yea, it cuts down on bandwidth, but it also keeps
the rest of us from following the entire thread.  At first I was impressed
that the PorscheFans lists were very well mannered with no childish
arguements.  While I certainly hope the excellent behavior continues, I
wonder if many (me too) are afraid to give public answers for fear of being
wrong?
   Anyway, I encourage everyone to post public replies whenever possible.
It will allow new owners to acquire valuable information, and eventually
(we too) will become experts.  How else can all us newbies carry the flag
when all you old timers die off?  Comments?     Fred  1984  930  Black
