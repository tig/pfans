Ed,
  Are you for real? I just had to laugh.....

At 01:28 AM 6/28/97 -0400, Hi-Teck Redneck <eyourkov@ix.netcom.com> provided us
with some of todays best humor when he wrote:


>OK, you have the pistons out, now clean the whole caliper in HOT soapy
>water and dry it quickly, so it doesn't start to rust from moisture. 
>Use compressed air again to clean out the fluid passages.  

I thought I heard about as much stupidity as one could have till I read
this.....

Jeeze....Your recomendation of using WATER on a brake caliper was UTTERLY
STUPID but recommending one use a petroleum based product near rubber (or better
yet don't install them?) indeed makes you THE HI-TECK REDNECK.

Please tell me this was a joke....You got me rolling on the floor..

whin ur dun.
