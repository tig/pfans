I just read the reply from Ed Yourkovich and wish to add my $.02. I have
always rebuilt my calipers myself but this time I had a trusted and
experienced mechanic do them. He worked for a Porsche dealer since the late
70's and now runs his own shop. Here are a few alternate points of view:

1/ Use a grease gun ( manual ) to remove the pistons, no way to damage the
pistons or yourself this way.

2/ Use brake assembly paste not brake fluid to lubricate every thing ( as
per ATE instructions too )

3/ Do use the dust boots on a street car, even if used on the track. You
should keep the dirt and moisture out from the pistons. Note that calipers
that do not use these boots have scrapper rings for the pistons. The heat
will destroy the boots eventually but at this point another $12 for a kit
isn't a high price to pay to protect the pistons.

4/ To do a REALLY good job separate the caliper halves and hone the
cylinders. The seals between the halves will work for many dissembles if
you're careful.

5/ I wouldn't suggest using water to clean out the calipers. Use a wash
tank and a good solvent sprayer.

6/ clean the sides of the calipers where the backing plate of the pads
ride. You don't want to remove any metal, just get back to the original
dimensions. Then apply a THIN coating to this surface ( basically wipe on
and wipe off ).

After having this done I've never had calipers work so well. And it took
him only 3 hours to do both fronts and bleed the brakes. Why do it myself ?
