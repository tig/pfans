Thanks everyone for your mail! I now have the knowledge I was looking for
and a whole lot more!  That info of no Mass. emmisions inspection on 15+ old
cars was a big relief!  Err... '97-'82=15... was that > or >=15? I guess I
would not have long to wait any way };)

I still have not seen the car and am having trouble getting in touch with
the owner.  I don't want to be a message pest, but if the car is in
resonable shape I want to make sure it ends up in my hands!  Hrmnn, I guess
I will become a pest. I am sure he will forgive me when I hand him a check!

I know this might be asking a bit much, but has anyone compiled a list of
differences between Euro. and U.S. models? Specifically '80s SCs?

Thanks again for all the mail, but please do not stop if you have anything
else you would like to send!


Michael -> still carless, but praying hard to the gods Stuttgart and
Zuffenhausen to deliver him into heaven.
