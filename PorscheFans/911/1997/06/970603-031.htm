<<I have a 95' 993 C2 that I want to autocross.  I have 17" wheels on it
 right now and want to buy another set of wheels to mount sticky tires  to,
but I was wondering if I could go up a size from the stock 255 40 rears and
205 45 fronts.  Is there room to go wider, if so, how much 

before I might get into the "rub zone"???>>

Scott-
If you are going to do some serious autocrossing then you will do best with a
smaller tire (16") that weighs very little to get the least unsprung weight.
 Wider tires are not always better either.  They lead to more wind resistance
and cause the car to use (waste) more power trying to turn the larger wheels.
 I wouldn't go any larger than a 265 in the back, and your 205's in the front
can stay- they are a very good size (unless you had to go to a 225).  There
is a reason that Porsche didn't go with huge 335 Viper tires in the rear of
the new Bi-Turbo- there's no need.  Hope I've helped.
