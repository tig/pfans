Well, things pointed towards the clutch as being suspect.  The last
couple of weekends I worked on preparing the car to remove the engine,
and yesterday we actually pulled it out.

Well, one thing was fairly
obvious.  The outer rim of the pressure plate had come in contact with
the release fork when the fork was disengaging the clutch.  I assume
this was the strange noise that I would occaisonally hear when
pushing the clutch pedal in to change gear.  I can only think this
did not happen before the new clutch was put in because along with
the new clutch, a new flywheel was installed.  The old one was worn
too thin.  The extra thickness of the new flywheel might have been
enough to cause the contact.

Secondly, there appears to be a lot of play at the release fork
pivot.  I have the non-adjustable fork.  I suspect it may well
be worn, as well as the "pin" that goes through the fork.  Does
anyone know a mail-order company that sells both these parts?
I looked in Performance Products, but they don't sell them.  That's
the only catalog I have.  I will enquire tomorrow as to the factory
price, but I expect it will be quite high.

Thirdly, on the back of the fork pivot are three things.  I'm wondering
if they should all be there as the number of items affects the offset
from the mount point, and hence the clutch operation.  There is
a rather thick washer, rounded to fit the back of the fork.  There
is a spring-tab type washer that will be under pressure and prevent
rotation when everything is tightened up.  Lastly, there is another
washer, presumably to make the spacing right..?!?!  I would be
very interested to hear any experience people have had with these,
and whether or not adding and removing washers is a valid method
of adjustment.

Lastly, the pivot pin was not locked in place, but came out
relatively easily with little strain.  My mechanic said it should
have been bonded in place, and it should have required "cracking"
to remove it.

Well, that's about it for now.  I'm pretty confident the clutch
really is the problem now.  Thanks to those who replied to my
initial questions!
