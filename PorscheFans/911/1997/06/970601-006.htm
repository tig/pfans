I am about to do some interior wark on my Nautical Blue Targa. The interior
is linen and the front seats are shot. I have arranged a deal with a highly
recommended local upholsterer where I have bought linen leather skins for
$345 and am trading dental work for the labor which will be $655 to recover
the front seats. The back seats are fine and the panels all just need a
little cleaning and conditioning. The original carpet was white and is
beyond bringing back. She said she could make new carpets or I could buy a
kit and she would install it. Any suggestions here. Has anyone purchased any
of these carpet kits and as I think I want to change to a more practical
black, do they come with pieces for the door pockets? Has anyone ever
removed the carpet from the door panels and is there any best way to do it.
Any suggestions regarding the quality of the carpet kits? They seem to range
from 300-800 and it's hard to understand why.

Just as general info I have bought some mechanical parts from Vertex in
Miami and not only were they courteous and prompt but the prices were great
and if you squeeze a bit they will do even better. I have also ordered the
auxilliary drier for the ac and am having it installed and will report on
whether it is worthwhile. 

I wanted to say, in this nasty day and age, that I have really enjoyed the
digest and the kindness of the subscribers. Thanks to whoever puts in the
time to run it.
