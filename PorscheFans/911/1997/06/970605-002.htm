Richard:

I recently purchased a Pioneer changer from another list-member... 
It, too, has an FM modulator that wires directly into the antenna 
lead.

I installed it in my wife's truck (a Dodge Ram with the standard
factory stereo and a Bazooka tube subwoofer) and she's VERY pleased
with it... It was easy to install, it's easy to use, and it's been 
completely reliable.

As some people on the list know, I'm a pretty serious audiophile, so 
I'm not going to say that the sound is particularly great, but 
the FM modulator certainly doesn't detract from the sound 
quality... I compared the sound of my wife's system (with the 
subwoofer turned off) to that of an identical truck with a 
factory CD player, and if anything, her system sounded BETTER.

Given the choice between 1) spending thousands of dollars on an 
all-new aftermarket car audio system in a fruitless attempt to 
achieve "musicality" in such a hostile environment, or 2) spending 
only a couple HUNDRED dollars for a retrofit changer with an FM 
modulator that could be easily interfaced to the factory stereo, I'd 
go with the latter choice and spend the money I saved on new CDs (or 
a new CD transport for my home stereo... Anyone want to buy a 
slightly-used Counterpoint DA-11?).
