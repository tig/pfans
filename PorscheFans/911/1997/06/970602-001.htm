I'm just going by information in Bruce Anderson's book, which states
that in early '76, all but the roof was galvanized, and the roof became
galvanized part-way through '76.

This is corroborated by info in Paul Frere's "Porsche 911 Story" - haven't
checked Ludvigsen yet.

I believe the long-term rust guarantee was initiated AFTER Porsche realized
how good the full-body galvanizing actually was, so it came after the
bodies were fully galvanized.
