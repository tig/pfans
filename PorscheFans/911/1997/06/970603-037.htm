Hi, all,

Given the following information, which car would you chose (I haven't
seen either yet, but am told both are in "great" condition). Obviously
a careful pre-purchase exam would probably tip the balance one way or
the other, but given that this is all the info I have at the moment...

- '89 Carrera coupe, 50,000km (30,000 miles), has had *light* damage
  to one front fender (I'm assuming suspension was not damaged), assuming
  damage was *properly* repaired.


- '87 Carrera coupe, VERY low mileage (don't know for sure, I assume lower
  than the '89), has sat for 2 years.


My concerns are... with the first car, what are the chances that I might
have problems with tire rubbing (if I upgrade to larger tires), and what
are the chances that the body might have been tweaked just enough that
the range of suspension adjustment is reduced. Obviously neither of these
can really be answered without checking out the car!

With the '87, what concerns would I have that it's sat for 2 years and
was not driven much? Will I be looking at lots of trouble with keeping
the engine sealed?

My personal feeling is that the '89 would be a better bet. Either, or
both, will undergo a pre-purchase exam, but I'd be concerned that it
might be difficult to assess the areas I'm concerned with.

Any & all comments appreciated!

Thanks,

Ross
