Have any other 964 owners experienced the infamous dual mass
flywheel 
failure?  Any experience with replacing the dual mass flywheel with 
something less prone to breakage?

	The flywheel in my '90 C2 Cab went (it was bad when the car
had only 8800 miles on it when I purchased it in March, 1996) and I
replaced it with a 993 flywheel/clutch assembly.  These are much more
stable, and fit with no problem (I'm told by my mechanic).  I bought a
slightly used set from a 993 owner who was turning his car into a race
car and saved a bundle.  I paid $600 for the entire flywheel/clutch
assembly, and I understand it would have been about $1600 from a
dealer.  You might want to look for a similar situation.
