My 'salvage' '72T has a damaged inner panel that nobody manufactures: it's
the panel that forms the upper front trunk floor and contains the opening
for the 'contraband compartment', you know, where the Webasto heater went
in early cars and where A/C parts go in the later ones.

This particular car has an upward bulge and a patched hole, plus, there's a
corresponding hole in the floorpan to the left of the pedal area. An
inventive mind would say a small bomb went off in the footwell...

Whatever the cause, this trunk panel is irrreparably damaged.

I need a good part, and do not want to buy a front clip to fix it. In fact,
I don't need the whole panel (the VIN is on the left side) just the portion
to the driver's side of the compartment will do...

TIA

P.S. I have the stock front bumper, complete with 'S' trim and fog light
covers in decent condition. Also 'S' trim for the rear bumpers... make
offer.

P.P.S. Also have Alpine 7513 AM/FM cassette/CD changer controller head unit
(removable face) with 25 watts-per-channel on the rear leads; RCA outs for
the front channels. Not terribly fancy, but pretty good. Make offer
