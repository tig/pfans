     Hi all,
     
     I could use a little advice.  For the second time recently (in the 
     past month) my batteries have gone dead.  The "Voltage" idiot light 
     has been coming on in the dash recently, though most of the time it is 
     just barely on, while at other times it is on full brightness.
     
     It is a 71 911T.
     
     What can cause that effect?
     
     Should I replace the Voltage regulator?
     
     The last time I charged the batteries, they didn't seem to quite hold 
     a full charge.  Could it just be that the batteries aren't taking a 
     charge from the car anymore?  Should I replace the batteries?
     
     Oh yeah, I already tightened the fan belt.  It isn't slipping.
     
     In an ideal world, I'd buy the voltage regulator, and a battery 
     charger, and see what happens.  Then, if I needed batteries, I'd go 
     out and get them.  However, my $$$ are short at the moment, so I'd 
     rather not part with all of that cash at the moment.
     
     If I do need to replace the batteries, should I get the OEM one's, or 
     can I replace them with a cheaper set?  Does anyone know the specs on 
     the 71 911T batteries?
     
     Thanks in advance!
