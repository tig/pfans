aloha,,,I've just had a new clutch set-up put in and now I notice a slight grind

when shifting from first to second...doesn't happen all the time but it does

whether shifting fast or slow...haven't noticed it down shifting...

could this mean 2nd gear synchros are going bad or that the clutch needs

adjusting??? I'd say it happens once avery ten shifts and also when I'm stopped

at a red light and want to put it in 2nd I may get a grind...I did not notice

this before I had the new clutch, p- plate, and t -bearing put in ...also

had brake job done , there's a slight hum of sorts just before coming to a stop.

the mechanic said it's the pads (pagid) settling in???? he said it's not the

bearings as they looked fine when he repacked them...should this sound be
there??

it didn't happen when I had the brkes done on wifes explorer..

aloha,,,,merlin
