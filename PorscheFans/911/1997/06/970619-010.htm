It was his contention that all after market mufflers and even the
factory sport muffler fail to damp this resonance.

============================================
Hi Eric,

I have 74 SSI/Borla (single outlet) combo on an 85.  There is definately
a resonance in this system but I notice it only when there is a building
on the outlet (drivers) side of the car and I have my window down.  I
dont think I would call it painful except maybe in a tunnel with the
pedal to the metal.  I certainly noticed an increase in volume to the
point that I can no longer go thru some drive thru banks and fast food
joints.  (no great loss).

FWIW
