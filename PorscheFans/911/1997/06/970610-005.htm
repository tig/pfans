Can someone tell me whether my recent experience with R1's is normal?
My 1971 911S loves to consume my time and money, but consuming a new
$600 set of R1's in one afternoon seems unusual.

My first set of track tires were Yokohama A032R's and the second set
were BFG R1's.  Both sets were run on essentially the same tack, with
mostly the same drivers (my son and I), and on the same wheels (6X15
front and 7X15 rear with R offsets in the rear).  The track is all paved
and is a reasonably smooth airport runway (and access roads) in Corpus
Christi;  the weather was similar (80-90 degrees) throughout this
period.  Most of the miles were during time trial formats (two 20 minute
practice sessions for each driver in the morning, then two sets of 4
contiguous timed laps/driver in the afternoon -- double these figures
since my son drove also.

After 50 track miles, the R1's (225/50-15 all around) had 3/32 of an
inch of tread remaining in the front -- with a 1.5 inch grove down the
middle of the right side tire (the course was run counterclockwise, so
this was the tire carrying the heaviest corner loading).  The rear tires
had only 2/32 of an inch of tread remaining -- again with a 1.5" grove
down the middle of the right side tire.  There are two spots where steel
cord is barely showing!  When hot the tire pressures were 29/36
front/rear.  The local Discount Tire store insisted that these tires did
not need any special break-in, curing or whatever.

After about 175 miles, the A032R's (225/50-15 rear and 205/50-15 front)
have 3/32 of an inch of tread remaining on the front and rear.  There
are no unusual wear patterns and all the tires look like they would last
another 50-75 mile of track use.  When hot the tire pressures were 30/34
front/rear.

By the way, I benchmark my performance against another driver (in a
somewhat modified '78 911SC) who is always very good and very
consistent.  While I was using the A032R's, the benchmark driver's time
was 1:18 and I was 6 seconds slower.  While I was using the R1's, the
benchmark driver's time was 1:13 (the course was slightly modified so
several tight turns were straightened out) and I was only 2.5 seconds
behind him.  My son's times were very close to mine (in fact he beats me
about half the time).

Good news: We were a lot faster with the R1's.
Bad new: $600 of tires in one day!

Is this normal?
