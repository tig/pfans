Has anyone upgraded the brakes on their C2?

I have been offered a couple of proposals as follows:

1.  Use 94 3.6 turbo front rotors and calipers or 993 calipers.  The 993
units look like a set of 928S4 units.  I would have to get adapters but it
seems that this should fit the front.  I was told to remove the break
proportioning valve after installation.  The rears would remain as stock.

2.  Install a set of 96 993 turbo calipers and rotors all the way around.
 Does anyone make a set of adapters for such an installation?  I'll assume
that the emergency brake is history with this setup.  Again, the
proportioning valve would probably go.

Any thoughts or horror stories would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Alan C.
