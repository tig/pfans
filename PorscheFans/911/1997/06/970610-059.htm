I'd like to fit intermittent wipers on my 1972 911T.
Currently the switch has 4 settings: off; slow; medium and fast wipe.  
Is it possible to rig it up so that the "slow" speed on the wiper stalk
operates the intermittent wipers etc?
Has anyone out there in Porsche-land done this to a 2.4???
What is needed to do this?  (I realise a relay of some model/type is
needed.  Can the wiring be run through the old stalk connections?)
Any help would be most appreciated as I've not read of anyone doing this
in tech articles anywhere.

One other unrelated question:
I notice that my car is wired from the horn grille area to the fuse box
for the optional fog/driving lights.
The relay is missing (still available?).  Is the wiring to the switch
and relay fitted from new 
or do I have to run some wires from the fuse box up to the switch etc?  
Is there a wiring diagram available to show this?

Thanks,
