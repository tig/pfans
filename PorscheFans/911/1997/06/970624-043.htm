Steve:
I'll throw in some comments for you to consider:

1)  Resale wise, driveable 912s rarely drop below $4K.  A lot of newer
924s and 914s have dropped below that.  What do you want to buy instead?

2)  You have a 911 chassis designed for 130+mph with an engine that on
paper can push it to 119mph.  Relatively speaking, the drive train and
brakes are slightly oversized.  1969 was a good model year, with the
longer wheelbase, better ventilation than earlier 911/912s.  If you like
911s, most of your car is one.  

3)  Are you concerned about longevity?  912s have been known to run
300,000 miles or more.  I'm concerned about the price of engine parts. 
Not that 911 engine parts are much cheaper.

4)  Do you want to race the car you own?  If so, you might as well sell
your 912 as-is.  Maybe buy a 914?  If not, try driving your 912 up
Highway 1 to Monterey.  Especially next year for the Historic Races at
Laguna Seca.  That's what I plan to do.
