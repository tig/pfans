Like Eric, I have 22mm Welt f/r.  However, mine came with poly bushings
not rubber.  The hardware is grade 8 (5 slashes) so it's adequate.  Sorry to
hear of your bolt breaking (it's attached to the toe-in eccentric) but 
I'm happy
with mine.   They may not be the best bars out there but I wouldn't 
rule them out
especially if you can find a set used.

Just another view,
