P-Fans:

In my search for my perfect car I have seen several cars with very very
low
milage, ie: '83 w/ 14K ... This worries me for some reason... What kind of
mechanical problems could I face by purchasing one of these cars or am
I
just loosing sleep over nothing? Why buy a car you never drive? And it
isn't
like they live in Alaska or something....

Should I be jumping onto these cars because they are great buys?

In March, 1996, I purchased a '90 C2 Cab with 8800 miles on it.  It was
one of the best purchases I ever made, and other than a known problem
with the flywheel, the car has performed flawlessly.  If the price is good,
I would jump on the '83 you're considering, assuming that is what you
want.  Although people like us (enthusiasts) find it hard to understand,
the fact is that some people have more money than they know what to
do with, and own cars that they don't drive.  The seller of mine had 5
cars, and drove his 500 SL most of the time.  Ironically, he sold my car to
me because he had just bought a brand new '993 Cab, and the 500 SL
was getting wet sitting out in the rain with the two Porsches in the
garage.  I told him to call me in 6 years, and I'd be happy to buy that car
when it had 8800 miles on it!

Bottom line: as long as you can believe the milage, go for it!
