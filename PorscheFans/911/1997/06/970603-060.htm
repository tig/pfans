As I trudge forward in getting my '72 T on the road, I've piled up a few
questions.  Any PFans advice would be greatly appreciated.

(1) My car is a sunroof conversion (cringe - at least the welding is
nice) where the addition is welded on about half way down the rear
window.  The front door frame around the glass doesn't fit quite right -
it rubs at the top and does not present a nice clean gap.  When I
compare measurements from each door, it appears that the problem is with
the door window frame and not the body.  One side measures 15" from base
of the window to the top and the non-fitting one measures 15 1/4" or
so.  I tried adjusting it and it looks like I'm at the limit.  Could
this door/window frame be from a Targa or a different year car?  I can't
find any body geometry info.

(2) I'm going to use Weber 40 IDAs instead of the MFI system.  It seems
like a good idea to use the engine shroud from a carburetored car from
both an aesthetic and air-leakage standpoint.  Could someone who has
done this let me know what sort of mods to the shroud are necessary? 
Also, if anyone has one for sale, please let me know.

(3) Along the same lines, what is the best reference book for Weber
carbs?  The Haynes book appears to be somewhat lacking in Porsche
information.

(4) Are there plugs specifically designed to properly seal up the
injector ports?  Where can I get these?

Thanks,

Scheid (72 that will live again)
