I have a surprise for you--cabs leak too! The front part of the Targa top
shares the same configuration as the cab. I think the leak is something you
live with if you own either body style. It is like the so-called "chinese
water torture". Mine has never been substantial, just a drip. Also, it
appears randomly, sometimes not at all (during rain).

The Targa is a more rigid car. The cab has a shock absorber in the engine
compartment to compensate for longitudinal torsion.

The Targa has no blow-back of air when the top is off. You can buy an
accessory for the cab that puts an air dam behind the seats to minimize or
eliminate this "problem".

The Targa top has much greater security than the cab due to the aluminum
plates inside, but a sharp knife will cut it up like cheese.

As for the minus that it's "not a cab", know that the Targa can be
converted into a cab. I personally recommend doing this to all Targa owners
so that the stock of Targa rear glass can be increased and the number of
Targas left for a given year will decrease.
