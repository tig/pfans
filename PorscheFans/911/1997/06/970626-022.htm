Buy it! You'll probably need it! I don't know where you live, but if
your
climate is anything like mine here in south Florida, you'll need the
warranty for AC repairs. I have a '90 C2 Cab with 35k miles that I've
owned for 2 years (5k/year) and luckily the PO bought a 7 year extended
warranty from Warrantech for $2500 a few years back. In the last 2 years

I've had about $4000 worth of work done on the AC, plus $500 for a new
distributor, $300 for injectors, $200 for misc. gaskets, and a few other
things
that I can't remember. The total is pushing $6000 for items covered by
the
warranty.There is a $50 deductable for each occurance for each system
(or something like that), so I've spent about $500 on deductables, but
that's
a lot less that $6000. I just spent $3500+ having my dual-mass flywheel
and
clutch replaced - these items were not covered.

My warranty expires in 3 months and after 2 years and $10,000+ in
repairs, I'm concerned that without this warranty saftey net,
maintaining
this car will send me to the poor house. I'm now faced with the choice -

sell the car and buy a '95 993 ($100 per oil change, ouch!) or a Boxter
or keep it and try to buy another extended warranty or risk financial
ruin.

Anyone else spent this much in repairs?
Based on my experience - buy the warranty!
