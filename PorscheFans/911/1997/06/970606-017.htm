I used to have this problem all the time.  I "upgraded" to a Momo Corse
steering wheel.  The reason for the new wheel was actually because my wrist
kept beeping the horn around tight turns and the Momo's horn button is small
and in the center of the wheel.

But, as it turns out, the hub kit for the Momo wheel gave me about an extra
inch clearance between the wheel & wiper stalk.  Also the wheel itself is
smaller, which helps to solve the problem a bit as well.

The only drawback to the new wheel is the necessity to rotate the speedo &
oil temp/pressure gauges so you can read them without a lot of trouble (since
it is smaller in diameter)

Oh yea, I think the wheel looks really cool too!  What other reason does one
need to buy a $200 steering wheel?  Overall, I would never go back to my old
wheel.
