    Shouldn't be a big deal. Make up a couple of hangers from wire to
suspend your calipers with as you remove them. Don't allow them to hang
from the brake line. You might consider replacing the rubber lines unless=

you KNOW how old they are. Of course, this will mean bleeding the system.=

    Remove the dust caps and take off the hub and rotor assembly.
Separating the rotor from the hub can be a little nasty. I think the
repeated heating and cooling tends to make the nuts weld themselves to th=
e
bolt.
    Reassemble, using a torque wrench on all the components. Replace any
bolts and nuts that don't look or FEEL kosher.
    Only other problem you may have is spreading the pistons when you go =
to
put the pads back. I have done this CAREFULLY with a piece of hardwood. Y=
ou
may not need to do this, but what usually happens is the new rotors are
thicker and the pads don't want to slide right in.
    Pump the brake pedal to reseat the pistons before you go anywhere. Yo=
u
may hear a pop when the pads come up against the rotor.
    Sounds like a drive gear is shot in your speedo or gearbox causing yo=
ur
speedo problem.

You can handle it, Dave Singer
