I had a strange problem with my seatbelt light coming on in my prior 911
(an '87 Coupe).  Turned out it was my alternator!

The seatbelt light would light briefly - typically between 1-2 shifts.
Here in San Antonio TX, we have the Jone's goup, so I whipped down there -
with less than 30k on the car, I wondered if this was "normal".

They told me that it was a "little known" indication that the diodes were
going in the alternator.  I trusted them, and the rebuilt alternator they
put in solved the problem with the seatbelt light.

On my 993 C4, I have another warning light problem - my brake (pad) warning
light stays on for about 20 seconds after I start up every morning.  Dealer
- after teardown and reassembley -  says "C4s do it, C2s don't.  ?  sound
logical?

Don't forget - the Porsche Parade is in San Antonio TX in two weeks!

Shirish,

I had a problem with my seatbelt light coming on intermittantly.  I =
checked the sensor and it was Ok.  Took the car to the dealer for a =
quick Bosch hammer read.  1 hour later I went down to check on the =
progress and they had my dash apart.  Said that there was no indication =
of a fault code so they were looking at the bulb/dash.  Didn't find =
anything wrong so they suggested a new 'brain'. Considering the cost, I =
decided to wait. =20

It hasn't come on since!!!  Don't really know what the problem was.   =
The old - take it apart and put it back together and it works syndrome.  =
Probably a loose connection in the dash.

Good luck,
