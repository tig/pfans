Having owned three 911s since 1976 and having put 20,000 miles on my 
'95 993, let me give my thoughts on some of your questions:

------------------------------
1) Anything glaringly wrong with the imitations (offset?)? Any
thoughts/preferences? I won't be doing any track time- just pleasure (Oh...
what pleasure) but will probably drive it fairly hard.

main item of concern, besides the offset, is strength.  The lower cost wheels
are usually cast, not forged aluminum.  This means if you hit a pothole
hard, the wheel could break rather than just bend like the OE wheels.  One
thing to look for is a TUV rating, which is a German strength test.  If the 
wheels have this approval, they are probably OK.
 
--------------------------------------
3) Will the 17" tires create a much harsher ride quality?

I don't think you will find them much harsher, espeically if you are keeping
to 
stock suspension.  My 993 has 17" wheels and sport suspension, and is 
still much more comfortable than my old '84 Carrera on 16's - this is on PA
potholed roads, too.

-------------------------------------
4) The PO ran BFGoodrich Comp T/A VR4 tires and very much liked them- not so
much performance oriented (V rated) however he was pleased with wet
weather/all season performance, longevity, price, and ride quality. Going to
the 17" tires, is there a comparable tire anyone's pleased with? Any
suggestions?

993 came with Yokohama A008s on them; rears wore out in less than 10,000
miles.  Replaced them with Comp T/A ZRs (255/40x17), cursed them for
approx. 2000 miles since rears wouldn't grip and car had more oversteer
than even my old '76!  Tires have worn in nicely now, and with about 8000
miles
are only half worn.  Handling now that they are seasoned is great wet or
dry.

One other thing - in a corner remember - NEVER LIFT!  Enter a corner at a
speed that you can maintain or slightly accellerate through and the handling
will simply blow your mind.  Lift drastically at high "G" load and you could
have a very expensive trip to the body shop.
