I have some parts for sale that came off a 1968 912 (though the first 
few are good for 911, too).  Asking prices do not include shipping (I'm 
in Los Angeles), and if you think a price is too high, call or mail me 
and we'll talk.


> Original black vinyl seats in excellent condition.  No rips, tears, 
etc.  Driver's seat has stock headrest, passenger's has none.  Prefer to 
sell together, but give me a call.       $350 for both

> Original round chrome side view mirror; chrome & glass in great shape.        
$25

> Four spoke steering wheel with 'butterfly' horn ring.  Has aftermarket 
black leather wrap, spokes need repainting, & vlack vinyl center Porsche 
crest is perfect.       $25

> (2) 912 solex carbs (40 P11-4) plus stock air cleaner housings.  In a 
box for 10 years but look complete and in good shape.  Would like to 
sell all together, but if you want just carbs or just air cleaners, 
let's talk.     $200 for all

> 1968 912 Smog pump.  I don't know if EVERYTHING is here, but includes 
pulley, mounting brackets, hoses, some fittings, in-line valves, and 
metal canister.      $80

> 912 Single point vacuum advance distributor, Bosch  0 231 115 061.  
Used.    $50


Thanks, I hope these help someone out as much as I want them out of my 
garage!
