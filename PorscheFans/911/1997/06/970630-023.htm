When I got my Porsche, I did a speed run on a deserted highway, at 3:00
in the morning,  162 mph, but the top was up.  Anyway, if the top is
down all the time, boot it, and leave it that way.  That's what I do.
________________________________________________
Dari:

If you are basing your speed on your speedometer, then you were
probably doing closer to 145, since Porsche speedos are notorious for
being about 10% off, even with original spec wheels and tires.  As for
the second part of your comment, I agree.  The top is virtually always
down on my '90 C2 Cab, and I just put the cover on and leave it there.


Now regarding the T Vs C.  Targas are safer and more secure, but there
is something to be said about driving with the top completely down. Early
in the morning,  the wind is blowing, the sun is starting its trip up, curving
country road, picnic basket in the back,  Oh what a feeling.  I love my 911
cab.  I've had it for three months now and I still get excited just looking at
the car.  Does this feeling go away? 
_____________________________________________
I've been watching this thread on targa vs. cab and until now haven't
chimed in, but that was then, and this is now.  I've had the good fortune
to own a coupe, targa and cab over the last 14 years.  My first Porsche
was a '75 911S that I bought used in 1983 and kept until I got my first
new 911 in 1985.  Driving the coupe was great, but having just moved to
L.A. from the east coast, I quickly decided that I wanted open air
motoring.  In 1985, I bought an '85 Carrera Targa, primarily because the
Cabriolet was significantly more money (as it has been ever since) and a
good bit harder to get at the time.

I wound up getting into racing (time trialling w/ POC) with the Targa, and
did that pretty fanatically in 1986 and 1987.  I loved the targa, and was
happy that it was better for the track, but even then, I longed for the
completely open air motoring of a Cabriolet.  I had the targa until 1989,
when a 77 year old woman in a '77 Cadillac that must have been about
77 feet long pretty much put an end to the targa.  After that, I went
through a series of Japanese sports cars (Nissan 300 ZX Twin Turbo,
Acura NSX and Mazda RX-7 Twin Turbo), and got back into a Porsche in
1996 when I purchased my present '90 C2 Cab.

Racing is still in my blood, as evidenced by my renting out Willow Springs
and Buttonwillow twice a year and putting on driver instructional events
(more on that in a separate post), but I can't say I'm sorry I have the Cab. 
Porsche has substantially improved the torsional stiffness of the Cab
over the years.  When I got the car, I put on H & R springs, which
lowered the car significantly, and larger, adjustable Weltmeister
anti-sway bars front and rear.  At this point, the car handles about as
well (although differently) as an NSX or 3rd gen RX-7, which is to say
substantially better than any stock 911, coupe or otherwise.  I really don't
miss any performance gain I would have from a coupe, and there truly is
nothing like driving around in sunny L.A. with the top down all of the time.
Targas are great, but there is a substantial difference when everything
behind the targa bar is gone as well.   My route to work every morning
(Manhattan Beach to Westwood, for those familiar) takes me along Vista
del Mar, where I drive right along the beach and look at the entire Santa
Monica Bay from Marina del Rey to Malibu, with the wind blowing my hair
around like crazy.  Life is good!!
