 Sorry I can't answer you, but this subject hit home with me.
 Please excuse my ignorance here, but I'm not sure of the exact
 terminology.
 I've got a '79 SC 3.0l that's had the advance futzed with.  The initial
 problem was that the "idler valve?" wasn't working properly and it tended
 to idle very high even when warm.  As a *temporary* fix (while doing some
 other work) my mechanic reduced the advance from 5 degrees to 2 degrees.
 This had the effect of reducing the idle at all times, even when cold.
 He told me that these valves have a diaphragm that can turn brittle over
 time and stop working.

 I plan on getting this fixed as soon as my wallet recovers from moving,
 but
 my question is what effect does this "fix" have on the engine.  The
 mechanic
 told me there wasn't any, but I am seat-of-the-pants certain that it is
 down
 on power.  My reasoning (if you can call it that) is that because the
 spark
 now occurs sooner, I'm getting a less-complete burn and hence, less power.
 I would also think that my emmissions are worse, since there is more
 unburned fuel being released.  Right, wrong, indifferent?  What should the
 advance be for optimum power/torque balance on a stock engine?

 BTW, I saw a post from a guy who had his set to 10 degrees!

 Thanks
