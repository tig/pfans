Use Wurth's Matte Black paint for the centers of the Fuchs.  Matches the
factory black almost perfectly and is pretty durable.  I painted mine
using
this stuff about two years ago and they have held up very well.

I have pondered over the years painting the anodized outer portions of 
Fuchs/Cookie Cutters with some of Wurth's Silver wheel paint (I like the

Wurth's stuff).  Has anyone done this?  I asked John Paterek about doing

this not long ago and he seemed to think it would be fine, but I wonder 
how the paint would hold up to tire changing machines, etc.  Any ideas?

HTH,
