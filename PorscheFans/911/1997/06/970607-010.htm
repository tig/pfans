Hello All:

I am considering the purchase of a '82 911SC Euro spec car.  I have done a
huge amount of reading in the last week trying to find info on the Euro
versions, but have had little success. I was wondering about the following
things:

1)      In order for the car to pass U.S. emmissions some kind of conversion
must have been done to the car, corect?  If so, if the car has passed VA
inspection does that mean that the conversion was resonably well done? Or do
I need to really have that checked?

2)      How can I tell, with out taking anything apart, if it has had the
tensioner updates to the engine?  If I can not find it in the receipts that
is. The exploding clutch has been changed, or so I was told.

3)      I will be moving to Massachussettes in Sept. any list members having
trouble with inspection in that state?


Any tips on SCs would be greatly apreciated as well!  I will be seeing the
car this week and am having trouble sitting still this weekend };) heheehhe.

Thanks in advance!
Michael who is carless, but hopefully not for too much longer!
