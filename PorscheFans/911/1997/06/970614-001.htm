Happy Father's day Ferdinand.

Some of you may recall a humbling 140mph off-road excursion I had
recently. Things are almost back to normal, but my mechanic tells me
that rather than hot brakes, the cause may have been improperly bled 
hydraulics. 

He says ABS systems cannot be bled in the normal manner, but that the
ignition must be on. (Also that when I removed the caliper the brake
pedal should have been fully depressed to prevent air bubbles from
floating upstream to the ABS unit, true?) Not mentioned before, a few
days before my Paris-Dakkar prequalification run at the end of turn one,
I had removed one rear caliper to replace a broken handbrake spring. I
carefully bled that caliper and had a firm pedal, until about lap 15
that is.

He thinks air in the system caused the brakes to fail rather than too
much braking for my own good. Anyone heard of this before, and if so,
are there really special methods to bleed an ABS system? It's news to
me.

How do you explain to the insurance agent about tire marks on the hood?
