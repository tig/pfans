Steve,

I currently have a k-27 turbo that is blowing oil through the intake system.
 All the turbos do this to some degree, however mine is rather excessive.  I'm
probably going to rebuild (or get it rebuilt) soon (next month).

I don't have any first hand experience, sorry.

Windward and PowerHaus rebuild Turbos for ~$595.  They sell rebuilt turbos for
~$695.  For some reason this didn't seem right, so I thought I'd look into it
further.

Yes, AutoMotion, Tweeks, and Auto-Atlanta have turbo rebuild kits.  If you buy
one of those kits, you might want to take the turbo to a shop to get it
balanced.  There are usually a few shops around all areas that rebuild diesel
turbos, so you may be in luck.  This might be the cheapest way to rebuild it.

The other option is to buy Turbo magazine (yes, I felt a little cheesy buying
it, but it did contain the info I needed).  It has adds from companies that
rebuild/repair turbos.  The going rate for most of the companies advertised
seemed to be ~$100 labor, and $150-$250 on parts (depending on what needed to
be replaced).  There are also many companies that sell kits to rebuild the
turbos (the kits are cheaper than the Porsche catalog prices)

This will probably be the option that I'll choose, however I'll have to remove
my turbo and look at it before I decide.

When I do remove the turbo, i'll update the list.
