     Last Saturday June 28, I participated my in my first driver's ed 
     event. I had a great time and thought I'd post a few thoughts in the 
     hope that I can encourage a few others to give it a try.
     
     The event was sponsored by the Portland BMW club.  The local Alfa, 
     Porsche and Shelby clubs were also invited to participate.  I'd guess 
     about 50-70 cars participated.  The format of the event was as 
     follows:
     
     Technical Inspection - Brakes, tires, lights, fire extinguisher, seat 
     belts, helmet, etc. Requirements vary so check with your club. 
     
     Driver's Meeting - Rules of conduct (passing, corner workers, flags, 
     etc.), who's who, etc.
     
     Ground School - For first timers and anyone else who wanted a 
     refresher.  Unfortunately what could have been a really good hour 
     session was fairly worthless due to an instructor with and attitude.
     
     Track Time - They ran 20 minute sessions for four different groups; 
     Advanced Senior, Advanced, Intermediate and Novice.  As a first timer 
     you are required to run in the novice group and be accompanied by an 
     instructor.  In addition there was no passing allowed during the first 
     session for any of the groups.  
     
     I won't bore anyone with the details of my sessions but I have a few 
     thoughts to pass on.  Going in to this I was pretty apprehensive.  Two 
     months ago I spent way too much (for me) on my car (a '91 C2) and was 
     really hesitant to take it out and thrash it.  I was worried about 
     putting my self into a semi-competitive environment and trashing my 
     car, burning up $500 of brakes and tires or scaring the daylights out 
     of myself.  As it turns out I had no need to worry.  My instructor was 
     outstanding and the other drivers were polite and very 
     non-competitive.  I was able to drive at my own pace without feeling 
     any pressure to speed up, slow down or get out of anybody's way.  I 
     was really impressed by the folks running the event. They made it 
     clear that everybody paid their money and should have an equal 
     opportunity to enjoy their session.
     
     I personally had the hardest time learning the line for PIR.  It seems 
     to me that my years of street driving have my driving lines which are 
     suitable for the street but are certainly not the fastest way around a 
     race track.  Between my second and third sessions a thunderstorm came 
     through and wetted the track down pretty good.  My instructor and I 
     spent some time with a schematic of the track and talked about what I 
     was doing versus what she wanted me to do.  My last session (in the 
     rain) was by far the best.  Driving on a wet track knocked the speeds 
     down a bit and exaggerated my mistakes so that I was forced to drive 
     technically correct.  Sort of like a skid car class.  It may sound 
     crazy but in the future I'll jump at any opportunity to drive in the 
     rain again. 
     
     I did take an opportunity to take a ride in my instructors 280ZX race 
     car driven by a friend of hers.  As one who's prone to motion sickness 
     I was ready to get out after about six laps but it was a really great 
     experience.  I got a much better feel for the correct line and braking 
     points.
     
     If you've never participated in a driver's ed event I highly encourage 
     you to check it out.  It's a great opportunity to really find out how 
     wonderful a 911 is when driven fast.  The best part is that YOU get to 
     decide what fast is.  I both got passed by much less capable hardware 
     and passed much more capable hardware but no one really cares.
