    Mike:

    Yeah, it'll probably work ok, especially if you don't plan on
    using it a lot... But you can get much nicer ones for around
    $60.

    The major Porsche mail-order distributors all have pumps for
    sale... Automotion (no endosement implied; it was just the
    closest catalog) sells their part number AC-6000 for $64.95.

    Keep in mind that if you buy a sturdy-enough compressor, you can
    use it to quickly add a few pounds of pressure at the track
    without needing to lug an air tank around or wait in line to use
    someone else's compressor.

    Yes.
