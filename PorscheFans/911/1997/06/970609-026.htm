Greetings folks!
To the individual seeking subject 911SC, don't take to much flak, IT can be 
found, although, sorry Chrissy, there are probably not 2 or 3 easily found. 
 I bought a 1980 911SC Targa with no rust, 112K documented miles (by the 
same mechanic that takes care of  our 912) for $9200.  YES, the seller did 
know what he could have gotten for the car.  The bottom line is he is 
fortunate that a few thousand dollars was not worth him having to put up 
with lots of people coming to his house to look at his (now, my) car.  The 
car is in sound mechanical condition, just had a new clutch and tranny put 
in the last year.  It needed a good wash and wax.  It is not in concours 
condition, nor do I plan on making it, but it is presentable and is a good 
solid car for me to drive.

Keep looking for your dream car and (reasonable) dream price,  it may take a 
while to find, but be patient, anything is possible

1980 911 SC Targa
1968 912, candidate for a salvage slip, but that's another story.
