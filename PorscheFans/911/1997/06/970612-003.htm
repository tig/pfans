Fans,

I received allot of positive replies regarding the 'Paintless Dental
Removal Systems', one of  particular interest was 'Dent Wizard'.  I have a
small dent located on the front left hand fender with no visible paint
damage and the dent is some what of a crease that is not very deep.  The
other is a dent on the front hood which is a little larger in diameter (not
like a stone dent or door ding) but is also a 'soft dent' with no visible
paint damage that is even difficult to see.

Now, I'm not sure how they structure their prices, but I've heard from
members on the list paying $75- $100 (US) for a single dent repair.  I went
to talk to one of the owners of Dent Wizard (the head office actually) and
he quoted me a whopping $550 to fix the two dents! ... plus tax! ... now
this is in Canadian funds, so I would expect to pay a little more, however,
the small fender dent was quoted at $250 (the receptionist said minimum
charge is $150) and the larger hood dent was $300.  I figure the fellow saw
a mint condition 911 with a fussy owner willing to spend some cash and saw
$$$$$$ instead of a fair price quote.

Am I just being inconsiderate or uninformed of the 'Dent Removal Process?'
or am I being hosed on my quote?   Are there any alternative franchised
dental removal centers other than Dent Wizard where I can get a competing
quote?

Joe
