I've never tried sitting on my shoes.
I would also never think of painting my car with spray cans, although I 
have seen it done. Your shoe analogy is a bit weak. 
The way I look at these things is that it would probably take a couple 
of days to dye my seats properly. 1. Prep and condition. 2. Dye. 3. 
Seal. Conservatively at leisure rates my playtime is worth, lets say 
$500.00. I would also prefer to do this once and be confident that the 
process will be guaranteed to work. 

I suppose, I have never been the type of person who drives ten miles to 
save $.50 on a loaf of bread.

I hope it works out. Good luck.

This is my final chapter on 'shoe wars'. You are certainly welcome to 
the 'last' word.

Richard.
