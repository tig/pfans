I ordered 2 sets of SSI's from euro products as well as a chip and Oem
style Muffler.  The SSI's were 795per pair ,the muffler (oem style for a
66) was $199 and the chip was $250.  They shipped when they said they
would and were helpful when I had questions.  They were honest adout the
fact that they drop shipped most their stuff and confirmed availability
with thier suppliers before telling me when things would be available. 
They even offered information as to where I could find a part cheaper
and quicker.  

I would not hesitate to order from them again.
