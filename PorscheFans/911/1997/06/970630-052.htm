I am almost as fond of my 911 as you, except I have seen sweeter (but not
by much) curves....8^)

Anyway, I went to the PartsHeaven swapmeet this weekend, and had the chance
to roam their wrecking yard looking for parts. =20

The good news is that I found a nice dash *in my color* for a bargain price.

The bad news is it was very hard walking amonst the killed Porsches.....I
could almost not bear to see them mangled and smashed like that.  It was
very sobering to see a 911 that used to be *just* like mine, same color and
all, bent, crushed, and broken. =20

It's dash will live on in my car....8^)

look (it's like in slow motion). I have sat and stared at it, I have sat in
it and made driving sounds. I miss it when I am out of town (I travel way
too much). I talk about the car like parents talk about their kids.  Its
crazy, but I don't think I am the only one.  I had dreamed about owning one
for almost ten years, it finally came true.
