It is pretty clear from all of the responses I have received that the
SSI headers don't have a resonance with most mufflers. So, my conclusion
is that the resonance is caused by the Triad muffler.

So, to fix the resonance problem I bought a Monty muffler and put it on
my car Saturday (an M-22 model). Wow, this is a really nice muffler. It
sounds great and is very well made. It has a deep, rumbly sound that I
really like and no resonances. It gets louder as you press the pedal,
unlike the Triad which was loudest and low RPM and got quieter as the
RPMs climbed. According to John Daniels (the maker of the SSI headers),
the Monty is made of the same T321 stainless as the SSIs. He said that
the B&B headers and mufflers are made from T304 stainless which
(according to him) is a lower grade. I know several people with B&B
mufflers that have had them split at weld seams. Of course time will
tell how the Monty holds up.

Here is the Aase Brothers web page, they are the U.S. distributor for
Monty:
