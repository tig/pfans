Greetings Pfans - Finally got around to my tensioner update project for
my 70 911T. Bought a kit from a list member almost a year ago for a good
price, not used either..  Made sure I had all the parts, chain rails,
etc.  Not a hard job as many of you have said. Found out after I
removered the chain covers, that it already had the newer chain rails,
so I didn't need to replace.  After I installed the right tensioner and
associated oil lines, I started on the left one.  Low and behold, the
tensioner line and the cam oil line didn't line up.  A quick call to
Zim's in Dallas reveiled there is a different line required for an early
model.   It should be here tomorrow.  In the mean time, I removed the
oil tank for cleaning and painting.  It revealed that it was also not
original, but had a tag on it from Foothill Radiator Co. in Upland CA.
It had a phone # and serial #, so I intend to call them to se if I can
get some more info on this car's early life.

also found the chain had a master link! Doew this mean it also has been
replaced?  These cars are amazing....  Looks good up on jack stands too!

Good nite
