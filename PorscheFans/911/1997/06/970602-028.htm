Thanks for the detailed response regarding my repaint on my '73 911S
targa.  Here are some more questions:

I'm debating whether or not to remove my front and rear windshields.  Do
you think it makes that big a difference?  I don't want any paint to get
to the interior of the car (ie dashboard).

The shop I'm thinking of going to has a good rep on Pcars but I've heard
the owner takes a long time (ie months).  Also so far he just walked
around the car and said he'd do the job for $5000.  I haven't gotten it
in writing yet.  Do you think its important to get it in writing?  He
gave me the old, the price is subject to change depending on what's
under the paint, routine.  

I want to do a color change from silver to aubergine.  Are old factory
colors like Aubergine (code 025) from '72 & '73 still available from
paint manufacturers like Sikkens or Glasurit?

This guy says he's got some bullet proof clearcoat from Europe that will
stand up to even brake fluid.  Is it a good idea to use this stuff or
should I go with some not so bullet proof clearcoat?

Do you normally remove the front VIN plate under the trunk lid at the
front of the car?  How about the paint code plate and the VIN sticker on
the drivers side door jamb?  I'd like to remove all of these?  How do I
handle the paint code plate and the VIN sticker?  The front VIN plate is
just pop riveted.

Thanks
Steve
