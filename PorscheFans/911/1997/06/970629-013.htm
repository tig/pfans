After questioning several Porsche experts at Brumos Porsche  I am
comfortable with the factory recommended 15,000 oil change interval. The
car has two oil filters, the usual one that catchs the big things as the
oil is returned to the tank, and another one on the line to the upper
valve train. Also consider that Porsche has twice as much oil as a
normal V8,etc which is necessary for cooling - this also translates to
twice as much oil for carrying contamination without harmful effect.  I
might also add that Mobile 1 (or other synthetic) will delay 'seating'
in these engines until about 4000-5000 miles have accumulated.  Meaning
that adding a quart each 1000 mi during break-in can be normal. 
Technology is such that if the factory is happy with 15,000 mi interval
- so am I.
