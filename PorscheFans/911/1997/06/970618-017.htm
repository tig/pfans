Hello P-phans-

OK, I know, (Or at least I think) some of you out there are still recieving
the list eventhough I only get the list about every third day, (if that),
so perhaps someone out there can answer my question.

First a little history, I have a 1983 911SC on which I have managed to
crush one of the oil lines, specifically the one that runs forward from the
motor to the oil cooler. I do not want to replace the entire line, I just
want to replace the crushed section.

My question is, does anybody out ther know what the pressure is inside this
line? I would like to know so that I may determine what kind of fitting
will be needed to replace the bad section. Hoping that a couple of simple
hose clamps over some hydrolic line will suffice, as it appears the line is
not round but more of an oval shape which will make it more difficult to
put a more substantial fitting, (such as ferrule fittings) more difficult I
suspect.

Any help would be appreciated, OH and please repond to my personal address
as I get the list only very intermitantly.

Thanks a bunch.
