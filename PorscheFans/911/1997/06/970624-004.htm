The shop that takes care of my other 4-5 cars tried to set up their analyser on my 
"73 911, but couldn't get it to read correctly. They said it was something to do 
with a reversed flow through the coil ??. They have 3+units, and could get none of 
them to give a correct reading. They went over everything in my shop manuals and 
could not figure out how to hook it up. This is a well respected shop, and they have 
taken care of my other car for over 20yrs. This is not a "Porsche" shop, but they do 
take care of a variety of other makes.. They were trying to do this for me as a 
favor, and spent about 1-2 hrs trying to get it to work. We were trying to get a 
"power balance" readout of the cylinders to diagnose a slight high-speed miss, which 
I think is now a full-blown injector problem. All I have to do now is figure out 
which cylinder !!!

Their new computor analyzer is a "INSITE" by Matco tools. They also have a couple of 
"SUN" analyzers.. Has anyone used these ?? I'm sure there is some way to hook these 
up to my engine. I don't get into electrical problems-- I just do mechanical!!! We 
have "lost" our Porsche dealership here in TH, so these guys are my best bet here at 
home. I don't want to run to Indy every time I have a question or problem, if I can 
help it. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks..
