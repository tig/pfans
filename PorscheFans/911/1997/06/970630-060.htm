I was wondering if anyone might have some insight on a brake problem I am
having.  I just replaced the front M calipers on my '71T with S calipers.
 Everything works great with the exception of a grating noise from the right
brake when I stop hard at lower speeds (<30).  The soud and feel is like when
the metal backing of a worn out pad is rubbing on the disk.  I started with
new Porterfield pads and have checked out everything I can think of.  The
bolts are tight.  The wheel bearings and tension seem right.  The disk  is
very smooth and has very little wear.  The car brakes great.  There is no
pulling to one side or binding.  I considered having the rotors turned when I
did this swap but decided not to.  I don't see how this would cause a grating
noise but could it?  Any suggestions would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
