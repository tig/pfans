Bob,
I am very interested in how it goes for you.  I had my '84 Targa top
redone by Dave Brown in CO (recommended), and at that time he said I
probably need my seals replaced, but he too said that the quality of the
parts from Germany is unacceptable at the present time.   Now that the
top is 'perfect', I can really hear where the other seals are leaking
air!  Not to mention how ugly the faded seals along the rear of the door
windows looks...

Let us know..

     Some time ago, I posted a message inquiring if anyone has replaced
their targa seals, and if there was any vendor recommendations.
Unfortunately, I didn't get any replies from the porschefans list,
however
I've been doing some digging myself.  I spoke with someone from German
Parts & Restoration (800-321-5432), and he said that the side seals and
the
rear rollbar seal are only made in Germany from the OEM.  He's seen some
front windshield seals made in the U.S. that were of very poor quality
so
be sure whoever you buy from to make sure it's made in Germany.  He said
the seals take a bit of patience to put on, and recommended taking
careful
notes as to location when pulling the old seals off.  Dry-fit the seals
several times before applying the 3M Rubber Trim Adhesive.  Their prices
seem fair so I think I will order the front and side seals from them.
The
rear seal (most $$) is still in reasonably good shape except for the
fabric
that has ripped off where the door window touches the seal.  I'm going
to
simply glue on some black fabric to these sections and this piece should
look like new.  I'll let you know how it turns out.
