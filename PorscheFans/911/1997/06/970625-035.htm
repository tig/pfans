Richard,

You can pick up Lexol cleaner and conditioner at just about any
tack shop in the lower mainland. They're widely used for keeping
saddles, etc, in good shape.

If you're near Southlands, there's at least 2 tack shops out there
(Maynard's and The Equerry), and if you're closer to Cloverdale,
try Stampede Tack. There's also a number of shops out in the Maple
Ridge area. Phone first to make sure they have both cleaner
and conditioner...

No need to travel to L.A.! (other than for business, of course!)

Disclaimer... I'm not 100% sure that the Lexol sold in tack shops is
the same thing, but I can't imagine why it would be a different
product...

Cheers,

Ross
