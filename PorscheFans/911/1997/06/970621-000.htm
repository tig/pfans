Thanks for the input. I guess I missed/forgot Bruce's discussion on
this.

When I went to pick the car up yesterday, after sending my original msg
to this list, the dealer told me that they would contact Porsche to find
out if Porsche would help take care of the repair. We'll see what they
say.

See Bruce Anderson's book regarding premature valve guide wear on 3.2
Carreras.  One early speculation he mentions in the book was that it
might
be more prevalent in cars that weren't driven much, although when I
discussed it with Bruce recently he wasn't fond of that theory.  He did
say
that the problem most often manifests at 40k-60k miles.  Maybe the odo
reading on your car isn't entirely accurate?  And maybe if you suggest
that
to the dealer they might be more accomodating?
