Fans,

Was sick and tired of the low quality Blaupunkt speakers in the doors of my
87 coupe so I finally took the recommendation of some of the list members
and purchased a set of Boston Acoustic speakers.  They sound really good
(even hooked up w/o and amp to my Blaupunkt Reno).  I bought the 757 model
of speakers with the square grills.  I wanted to maintain a stock
appearance and use my factory grills, however, the 757 (a 5.25" speaker)
didn't fit flush with the drop in and I had to use the spacer/grill
assembly provided from BA.  My question is the following:

I didn't want to cut the door skin (ouch!) so I just screwed the speaker
into the skin, because after all, the speaker cleared, the old holes
weren't in-line with the new speaker set.  I didn't use clips of any kind
because the didn't reach and I'm not certain whether screwing the speakers
into the door skin (which is made of a cardboard like material) would hold?
 The speakers appear very sturdy in there, however, because there isn't any
met backing, I don't feel as though the job was done professionally because
the screws never really bit down on anything, but seem to hold the speakers
quite firmly.

Any suggestions or advice from those with similar installations?

Joe
