Sadly I believe that Alldata no longer sell Porsche manuals :-(  I suspect 
that PCNA may have had a hand in stopping them, as they used to. (The 
porschephiles list carried a few reviews, I seem to remember). There was 
also someone who worked at Alldata who subscribed to the list - perhaps he 
(sorry, I can't remember your name) could tell us the true story?

This information comes from the following e-mail from Alldata:

} At this time we currently have coverage from 82-93 vehicles. The 1994
} information will edited and on disc in approximately another nine months.
} Also below is a listing of non covered vehicles.  Thank you for your

I did recently get the CD for my BMW and found it quite good - they had a
special which gave you the TSBs and the Repair Manual for around 20 US
dollars (and were happy to ship to the UK on a credit card number through
the Web site).
