What type of reading should I see on the oil pressure guage for a 1980 
911SC?  It typically hovers between the "0"and "1" marks at idle fully 
warmed up, and the "3" and "4" marks on the freeway.  This seems a 
little low, especially at idle.  I am running Castrol 20W-50 in Phoenix 
AZ.

Also, on a related note, the needles on the oil pressure, temp and level 
guage seem to "bounce" around more that other guages that I've seen.  Is 
this normal?  I would think that especially on the temp and level 
gauges, the needle would settle on a reading and stay more or less 
fixed.  The tach seems to do this as well, on shifts, then settles down 
to a steady reading, but not as smoothly or quickly as I would think it 
should.

Thanks for any help.
Alex Gilmour

     I'm selling the original phone dials from my '86 951 (REMEMBER, these 
     wheels have the '86 offset):
     
     2 7"x16" (front) and 2 8"x16" (rear) with all center caps included
     
     All 4 wheels are in good shape and have never been bent or curbed.  
     They have been on the car since delivery from the factory (only 57,000 
     miles ago).
     
     Will sell the set for $700 but will consider any reasonable offers.  
     Buyer pays shipping.
