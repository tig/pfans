The bleed nipple needs to be on the top so that bubbles will escape when
you bleed the brakes. You *did* bleed them thoroughly after replacing
everything, didn't you? Trapped air will of course cause a soft pedal.

I bled my brakes just this last Saturday using my homemade pressure
bleeder. It is a 10psi regulator whose output pipe is connected to a
spare brake reservoir cap. The only drawback to this setup is the
potential of running the reservoir dry. I have to check and refill the
fluid level after each caliper is bled. I was looking in the Snap On
tools catalog. They sell a hand pump brake bleeder that holds up to a
gallon of fluid for $143. While this is not cheap, it would certainly be
handy if one does a lot of brake bleeding. Since I like fabricating
inexpensive solutions, I might try to adapt a garden pump sprayer to the
task of brake bleeding.
