Has anyone ever heard of aftermarket wheels harming the 911's suspension?

The reason I ask is because I replaced my factory 17x7, 17x8  Boxster wheels
with 17x8, 17x9 Speedlines.   One of the tech guys from Porsche, Reno claims
that unless the offsets are exactly factory (which they aren't because of the
increased width)  the new wheels will effect geometry which, in turn, can
ruin the suspension,  ride and tires.  He said that Porsche does not apporve
of any aftermarket wheels for their cars.

I've checked several sources (including dealers) and thus far can't find a
single incident in which a Porsche owner has harmed their car because they've
switched factory wheels with Speedlines... TechArt, Gemballa, Fikse, etc.  

What do you think?
