>I have another question which shows how wet behind the ears I am at 911 =
maintenance.  I decided to give my newly >acquired 911 SC an oil change =
and a treat by switching to Mobil 1.  When I got underneath to drain the =
oil I expected to >see two drain plugs, one in the tank and one in the =
middle of the crankcase. In all other 911's I've looked under,  the =
>crankcase drain is in the middle of a round metal cover.  My cover is =
blank, as in no drainplug.  Is it safe to undo the nuts >that hold the =
cover in place and drain the oil that way, or am I looking in the wrong =
place entirely?  What's under the >plate?  Why would my car have this =
type of cover?

Eric, it's possible a PO stripped the drain plug threads on the old =
plate.  Plates with drain plugs are NLA from Porsche.  You'll have to =
remove yours to do a proper oil change.  When I found stripped threads =
on my cover plate, I shopped around and found a good used one from =
Foreign Intrigue (see Pano ads) for about $15.  You may want to do the =
same before you change your oil.  Be sure to get new gaskets and =
possibly spring washers before you take off your old plate.

When you remove the plate, you will expose the oil screen (it's also =
hard to do without making a mess and burning your hand with the hot =
oil).  This would be a good time to see if your oil screen has been =
updated.  This will be hard to describe.  The original screen is just =
that - a screen. The updated screen has a solid metal top plate that the =
oil pump pickup goes through.  The screen mesh is around the perimeter.  =
This update is intended to solve a high RPM oil scavenge problem in the =
early SCs.  If you plan to track or autocross, you should definitely =
update.  This part is hard to find used, but I lucked out with Kempton =
Brothers ($35).  Best new price I found was Carlson Porsche ($70).

When I put the new screen in my car, I found I had to turn the cover =
plate 90 degrees so the drain plug wouldn't interfere with the new =
screen.  This puts the drain plug on the left side of the engine, =
towards the catalytic converter.

The drain plug sure makes oil changes easier, but at least your style =
cover plate forces you to look at the oil screen for bits that may be =
signs of trouble.  I try to take mine off every now and then just to =
check.

Hope this helps.
