I have the following parts for sale.

1)  1 complete set of wheels (2) 15x7 911R offset (These are the real
deal) and  (2) 15x6 with the same deep offset to match the rears.
These are the perfect set of wheels for the old narrow body cars.  I
have run these on the track for the past two years with 225/50 rears
and 205/50 fronts on a 73 Targa.  $1200

2)  1 set of 2.2S pistons and cylinders.  I have not removed them from
the engine yet, so I can't give you a price right now.  Someone has
already expressed interest in these, and they have first right of
refusal.

3) Early 911S steel front bumper/spoiler.  I wont have it in my
posession until next weekend.  I'll price it then.  As above, someone
has already expressed interest in this, and they have first right of
refusal.

Car for Sale

1973 911T  163Kmiles on chassis.  This has been my track car for the
past two years, and I am moving up to a "full time" race car.  The car
will be getting a fresh coat of paint (Sepia Brown orig color).  This
car has never been wrecked.  The front pan under the gas tank was
replaced by a PO.  I have cleaned and treated the battery boxes.  They
are currently rust free.  Some minor surface rust on the body that
will be fixed when the car is painted.  It will have a 2.4E MFI motor
going in after it has been freshened.  The torsion bars have been
upgraded to 23f 28r. Carrera front brakes.  Autopower roll bar. (PCA
race legal) Front strut bar.  Old Recaro seats,  I should have a set
of stock seats available.  With my race motor, this car has run 1:39
at Road Atlanta and mid 1:20s at Roebling Road in Savannah.  This is a
great track car and very fun and easy to drive.  $9000  (If you want
the car before it gets painted brown again the price can be
negotiated. but you better hurry)  Driveway stills  and action
pictures from the Feb PCA race in Sebring can be seen on my personal
page at www.magicnet.net/~johns/porsche.html.


The car and all the parts are located in Orlando, FL.  Other parts may
become available as the race car conversion continues.
