Hello P-fans,

I noticed some talk about brake bleeders so I'll throw in my $.02.

I used a old cap from a 356. As already noted almost all ATE reservoirs use
the same top. I drilled a hole in it to accommodate a quick disconnect male
hose adapter. Hold it on with some rubber washers and a nut ( it doesn't
have to be fancy ). Remove your drain hose form the reservoir and plug it
off. I use a rubber cap from the bleeder valve on the caliper. Someone on
the list was selling a cap and regulator - it might make your life easier.

To me the most important part is to use VERY low pressure. I only use 5 - 7
psi. This pushes the fluid out slower so you run less risk of running out
of fluid, does less potential harm to the master cylinder, and prevents you
from injecting air into your brake fluid. This last point is especially
important if you are using silicone fluid, which I have successfully for 12
years. Make sure there are no air leaks - this will again contribute to air
in the fluid.

If you drain the fluid out a hose into a jar you can easily judge when you
are getting close to your reservoirs limit. With this low pressure it takes
about 15 - 20 seconds to do a caliper.
