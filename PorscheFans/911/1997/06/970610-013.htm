Like many C2/C4 owners, I've pealed the eye level brake light off my rear
window.  The adhesive peals off the glass without damage.  A black
plastic film outline remains on the glass (it presumably serves to hide
the adhesive from view.)  Even the plastic film <italic>could</italic> be
removed, but I've not risked it -- it's pretty damn secure looking at it
may even be in contact with the demister wires.

Anyway, that leaves me with better viewing of anyone that might be, say
pacing me at less than 300 yards...

I was thinking of finding a dead 993 and taking it's external brake
light.  Maybe just finding a neat, thin strip of LEDs would suffice.

Maybe someone has advice on the safe removal of that black plastic film


from the inside surface of the rear window.
