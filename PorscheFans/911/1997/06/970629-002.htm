I'm the 1987 Targa that started the recent long term discussion about
bringing parts to the mechanic. Well he really got more than even with me.
By pumping up labor beyond reason on many of the services, keeping the car
an extra week and generally doing a poor job. After I got the car a week
late with the ensuing extra week of renting a car and being forced to pay
with a bank check I drove it away and 2 miles down the road it quit. He said
I had a bad cylinder head temp sensor and a bad relay to the DME. With that
$250 outlay plus the original bill I managed to pay more than his original
estimate despite "saving" $400 in parts.   

I have since brought the car to three other service people because it didn't
seem to be driving much better than when I brought it in $2800 ago. All
three said the valves need to be adjusted again, two said the clutch seemed
pretty lousy (had a new clutch and the service bulletin on the shaft and
throwout bearing) and all said the car was very slow. 

There is a question here. One fellow who seemed very knowledgable and
straightforward and who I thought would be someone I would like to work on
the car faxed me an estimate for an additional 2200 which he said he would
discount 600 if I did the work by July 15. This included 30 hours of labor
at $60/hr, 5 hours valve adjustment, 6 hours fuel calibration,2.8 hours
fuel system carbon clean and 4 hours to install front rotors and pads. My
sense is that this is insane and he has simply jacked the price to make it
look like he was being a prince and giving me a good discount. Also another
mechanic who was highly recommended said he had no Idea what he could do for
6 hours to recalibrate the fuel system.          

Am I losing my mind or just money?
