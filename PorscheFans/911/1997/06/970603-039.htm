I have two sets of Fuchs, one of which needs spiffed up a bit.  I called
Imparts to get some paint and was advised that I should not paint these
wheels (imagine, talked out of a sale by the salesman) since the
original
finish was anodized and I really should send them to Mr. Woods for
proper
refinishing. 

....

Any experience out there with painting these black again?  Is this a bad
idea, or what?

I painted mine and am only marginally satisfied with the results.  I
used a Rustoleum premium grade primer and enamel.  The paint seems to be
very resistant to chipping, but I am unhappy with the quality of the
finish.  I also spent far to much time preparing and painting. I had to
use a paint stripper to remove the old faded black paint.  It took
several applications, after which I had to wet sand. 

They look good from a distance, better than the old paint.  The price
was right, but in the end I got what I paid for.
