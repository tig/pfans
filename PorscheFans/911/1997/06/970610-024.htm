Hey Fans,

Wss wondering if any of you have had your steering wheel recovered by =
Alan Gunn Leather out of Florida (I think). Have seen their adds in Pano =
and am contemplating what to do about my wheel. Seemed the PO did =
nothing to it to preserve it and its shot. Can't decide on replacing =
with a nice Momo wheel or getting this one recovered. Can anyone shed =
some light here on pros and cons? Also if anyone has replaced wheel with =
a Momo can you offer any tips as to model you prefer and why? I'm not =
planning on autocrossing or any track events. Its just my daily driver =
that I enjoy to the max and am wanting a nice wheel to set off the =
interior a bit. TIA
