I just put a set of SSI headers/heat exchangers on my car. I used a
Triad sport muffler with them. The system works very well, there is
definitely more power throughout the RPM range.

There is only one problem: there is a loud resonance between 2K and 3K
RPM. It is not just loud, it is nearly painful. Dave Said, the maker of
the Triad muffler, says that this is a characteristic of the '74 header
design that the SSI's use. He went on to say that the stock '74 muffler
was carefully tuned by the factory to cancel the resonance. It was his
contention that all after market mufflers and even the factory sport
muffler fail to damp this resonance.

So, do any of you, my esteemed p-car colleagues, have SSI systems and if
so, do they have this resonance?

Does anyone have any experience with the '74 style Leistritz muffler?
Does anyone have a used one for sale?

TIA,
