========================================================
There was a thread on this a while back (6 MO.?).   The only part I
remember was th analogy of a restaurant. That is; you don't bring a
steak to a restaurant so why do you expect to be able to bring parts to
a mechanic.

I don't buy this analogy in its entirety.  

I think the situation is a bit closer to asking to supply the materials
out of which your house is to be built.

To me a mechanic is in the business of fixing cars.  Mechanics also
stock an inventory of parts which allow quicker repairs.  This clearly
benefits the customer and the mechanic.  The customer has his car and
the mechanic can get on with earning his living.  If customers bring
their own parts you get the same benefits.  The only difference is that
if enough customers bring their parts the mechanic does not have to
carry as large an inventory of high volume products such as oil.  She
still is carrying the other bits and pieces that allow her to perform
her work and customers that wish to use those parts should pay a fair
markup (What is it worth to you not to have to order valve cover gaskets
when you have your valves adjusted?).  If she has to carry the parts
then she should be able to make a profit on them to cover the expense of
doing so and to make a reasonable profit for the service she provides.  

If, on the other hand, you provide the part, then your mechanic does not
have the hassle of buying, inventorying etc..  If a mechanic complains
about lost profit on parts she is either charging to much for the parts
(or too little for their labor).

One other issue that your query raises is the issue of who pays when the
part is the wrong part.  When your mechanic buys and profits from the
sale of a part you are in part paying for their assumption of the risk
that the part turns out to be the wrong part (either ordered incorrectly
or shipped incorrectly) or that the part does not arrive on time etc.  

If you provide the part and its the wrong part then you should pay for
the time your mechanic loses because if it.

The deal I have with my mechanic is that he provides the parts unless I
tell him that I have found the part for $x.xx (using my resources e.g.
time and the web).  If I find the part I tell him what I can get it for
(price plus tax plus shipping) and ask him what he can get it for. You
have to trust your mechanic not to say $ x.xx - $1 when he normally
charges $50 less - but if you don't trust him you should find another
mechanic anyway.  

As a practical matter I am willing to pay him more than the guy across
the country because if there is a problem I can go him an get it fixed
if I buy from Joe in North Dakota and its not right its a potential
problem that I have to deal with.  

I pay him to make sure its the right part (using his expertise).  If I
want to discuss what parts to order then I don't have a problem paying
for a "consultation" (usually a few good cold German beers).

I offer to pay my mechanic in advance for parts he gives me a break on
(one of the things I pay for at "retail is the use of his money) 
   
If I'm having parts shipped to his garage I always confirm tha t this is
OK and then give him another call when I have an ETA.(If he has to
"deal" with the shipping in any way like a damaged box or part the he
gets paid for his time)

What it boils down to is what do you expect your mechanic to do besides
the wrench work and how do you propose to pay for his time, experience,
and expertise above and beyond the wrenching.  

Just some thoughts
