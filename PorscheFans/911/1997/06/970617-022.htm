Here's my story:

	I decided to disable the upshift indicator light in the tachometer of my 
'86 911.  I followed the procedure outlined in a back issue of Panorama (to 
answer the inevitable question, to disable the upshift indicator light on 
an '84-'89 911, you unplug the wire harness from the tach and remove the 
black wire that goes to the number 1 pin).  The modification worked great 
-- for a while.

	About a week after I disabled the upshift indicator light, I noticed, 
after starting my car, that my tachometer was operating erratically.  The 
needle was, from time to time, not smoothly showing the engine's 
acceleration and deceleration, instead, it would "chop" between, say 2 and 
3 thousand RPM.

	After that, I noticed that sometimes the tachometer would not work at all 
when the engine was first started, but would "fix itself" and work fine 
after about a mile, and after rapping on the Tach's glass dial with my 
knuckle.  So, concerned with the difficulty involved in removing the 
tachometer (it's tough to get it out from between the dash and the steering 
wheel), I removed the speedometer and checked the Tach's connections while 
it was still in the dash.  I found that by jiggling the wires and/or the 
connector, I could get the tach to work or fail.  Unfortunately, the last 
jiggle during this experiment left me with an inoperable tach for the 
balance of my ride back home.  (it is important to note that both when the 
tach was operative and when it was not working, the night lights inside of 
the tach were operational -- I believe that this indicates that the problem 
was not a faulty ground to the tach, since this is handled by the brown 
wire going to pin 6).

	When I went out to follow up the next day, the tach worked like new again. 
 However, the next trip, the tach didn't work for several miles.  My final 
check was to take the tach back out of the dashboard and check the 
condition of each wire going into the Tach's 6 pin connector.  They all 
looked fine, and I tightened each wire connector with a pair of needle nose 
pliers to assure a tight connection, but all combinations of jiggling the 
connector an/or  the wires would not restore my Tach's functionality, and 
after a 5 mile drive (and lots of futile knuckle rapping) with no life from 
the tach, I removed it and concluded that the tach is defective.

So, after that very long winded explanation, here are my questions for the 
group:

1)	Broken Tach?  I think it sounds like I have a bad soldier joint or two 
inside of  the tach which happily sat dormant until I manhandled the tach 
out of the instrument panel and put pressure on the Tach's connectors for 
the  first time in ten years.  (just last year, I had my DME computer fail 
because of bad soldier joints inside of it -- bad year for the German 
electronics industry I guess)

2)	If it is a bad tach, where should I send it to make it well?  I live in 
Northern Virginia, but, after conducting a search on the web, found the 
Speedometer shop at http://www.speedometershop.com .  I have talked with a 
person there who sounded knowledgeable both about automotive electronics in 
general and 911 tachometers in particular, but wanted to get this list's 
comments before I entrust a stranger on the opposite corner of the country 
with my Tach.

	Of course, if there is anything else I am forgetting to tell you, let me 
know and I'll fill you in.

Thanks for the bandwidth,
