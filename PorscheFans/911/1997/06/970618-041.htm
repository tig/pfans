A fellow named Ray Dicius, most excellent autocrosser and time
trialer in the Bay Area, now pursuing his fortune in Newport Beach
below LA, had something like this fabbed somewhere around
Southshore, Lake Tahoe.  His trailer was custom made to hold
floor jack, a set of tires, tools, etc, but the trailer could be almost 
anything.  Perhaps some of the overly aggressive motorcycle
touring trailers could be adapted.  The trick part, I thought, was
that they fabricator removed the license plate, cut a hole in the 
bumper, fabbed a brace that would fit behind the bumper and
incorporate one of those removable-trailer-ball receivers (the little
square jobbies, to be technical).  He then provided an appropriate
adaptor with the appropriate tow ball, and also used an adaptor
to make a special license plate mount.  You had to look really
close to see that there was anything different than stock when
the license plate was on.  To toe, remove the license plate,
insert the adaptor with the toe ball, hook up the trailer and go.
I'll try to find the name of the fabricator if anyone asks, but it
may take a day or so.

All this being said, unless you are trying to be at the very peak
of competition, I agree with Eric that it's easiest to mount the
sticky tires at home and drive to the track on them.
