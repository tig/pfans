Hi Don,

Thanks for the note.  I'm sure you're right.  The 911 stand,
made for the 911 engine, is the best way to go.

But I guess I don't see why a conventional engine stand, which
can easily support a pretty large, heavy conventional engine,
one with a cast iron block, for example, can't be trusted to
support a 911 engine.  I understand about the lip on the 911
engine case and accomodate it with a 1/4" thick aluminum washer
half ground so it simultaneously rests snugly on the lip and
on the recessed area. There are any number of other ways to do this.

The four 911 engines I've rebuilt this way have felt very sure and solid
on the stand.  I know other people who have done lots more with
this kind of arrangement.  I suppose if I were in the 911 engine business I'd
buy a factory stand, if for no other reason than it must be a lot
easier to attach.  No finagling with four arms.  And when you're
in business, time is money.  I'd probably also buy a whole lot of other
special tools instead of making do with makeshift jigs and rigs.

But I think for the home hobbiest, who isn't in business, and
for whom the hobby is a way to spend time, a simple "American"
stand is just fine.  Am I missing something?

Regards,
