First of all, how much do you trust your mechanic? I am suspicious of
his suggestion to get a used transmission. Did you know that
transmissions with factory limited slip are relatively rare and quite
valuable? It would be very difficult to find a used G-50 with a factory
limited slip for less money than rebuilding yours (assuming it does in
fact need rebuilding, G-50s are robust transmissions). Besides, you
already have a used transmission. Why would you want to replace it with
another of questionable heritage? There is the possibility that he would
want to replace your tranny with a non-LSD one and then he could rebuild
and sell your old one for a handy profit. Also, what has he done for
those couple of hours of labor? If the transmission is still in the car,
he couldn't have done much except adjust the shift and clutch linkage
and that shouldn't take several hours. I'd get a second opinion.
