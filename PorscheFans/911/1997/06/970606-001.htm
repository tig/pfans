Hi Charlie,

I don't think moisture in the gauges is uncommon. I've had it in various
gauges on my p-cars.  Once it gets in there it seems never to fully
evaporate (at least not in Seattle, where I am also).  The only way I know
of fixing it is to take the gauge apart, either let it dry or dry it well
with a hair dryer, and reassemble.  In the cases weher I've done that the
fogging has not returned.

>4. The "Oil" gauge....is mysterious to me.

It's 'supposed' to indicate the level of oil in the oil tank.  There's an
electro-mechanical sender in the tank--looks like the ball float in a
toilet, and works the same way.  It's 'supposed' to be read only with a
warm engine, at idle.  The reason for all the 'supposes' is because it's
not really all that accurate.  The popular wisdom is not only use it as an
indicator, but rather rely on the marks on the dipstick for proper
indication of a full oil tank.
