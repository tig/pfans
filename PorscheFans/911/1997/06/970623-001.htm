pretty good paint job and try to sell it at a higher price?   Does anyone
have a sense of the price range for a car in the condition I've described?  

Why do you want to sell it? Or, why do want to fix it up just to sell it? If
you dont' like the car, get rid if it, if you like it, keep it and fix it
up. It doesn't matter how much money you put into the car as long as you
like it. Also, once the car is completely fixed up, it becomes essentially a
new car. So, what kind of new car can you get for the cost of restoring this
one? Probably some 15,000$ Nissan that will depreciate like a lead balloon
the day after you buy it whereas the 912 will retain it's value much better.
So, it's wiser financially to invest in a classic than to buy a lesser new
car, but only if you're having fun. You know you're having fun when you make
excuses to "work" on your car, and when you don't mind paying for those
expensive parts.
