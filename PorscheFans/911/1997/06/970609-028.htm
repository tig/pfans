If anyone knows of a good shop in the Redmond/Seattle, WA area that can
adjust 911 speedos I would appreciate it. I don't like the idea of those
virtual miles adding up on my low mileage car and I don't like not
knowing how fast I'm really going (it appears my speedo is reading more
than 10% high).

Thanks.

    Hi Alex --
     
    >[snip]
    >While I was at the speedo shop, I had mine checked.  Seems to be
about
    >5 mph optimistic at 65mph.  Is this normal?  I saw an article in
Car&Driver 
    >where they had a new Turbo S and it was reading as much as 19mph
over.  (of 
    >course they were doing 180 at the time.)  
     
    When I first bought my car year before last, it seemed like suddenly

    everyone else on the road was driving lots faster than before...so I

    checked my speedo (by computing speed vs rpms given gear ratios,
tire 
    diameter, etc, and assuming the tach was accurate) and sure enough
it was 
    reading about 10% high at just about any speed.  So my speedo error
was 
    consistent with what you're seeing, and even reasonably consistent
with the 
    C&D Turbo S test.
     
    When I think of all those extra "virtual miles" that *shouldn't be*
on my 
    odometer...sigh.

    I'm not sure exactly how either, but it can be done.  My speedo shop
guys 
    were able to adjust mine to read accurately.
