You're right, we did discuss this some months ago without reaching any
kind of consensus. Not that anyone expected to mind you. But here's how I
see it:

You own this car and you have to maintain it. You can take it to someone
and have them do it for you. They will charge you money. Maybe a lot. If
they charge too much, you can take it elsewhere. If you think everyone
charges too much, you can learn how to do things yourself. It may be
complicated, but it is not rocket science. If it turns out to be too much
trouble to pay everyone else what they want or to learn how to do things
yourself, then I begin to question a person's committment to their
Porsche. People like this should get Volvo's :) I'm not being insulting,
either, but it's been said many times. These are racing cars and you must
pay (or do) racing car maintenance on them. It's a fact of life. Ya just
gotta suck it up and do it. End of story.
