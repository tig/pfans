Thanks for all the rear shock replacement tips. Dave, thanks for the tool
sizes, it was nice to buy the socket before I needed it! I thought I'd post
the tip summary for all.

Tools needed:
7 mm open end wrench
17mm open or box end (box worked best for me)
22 mm socket.
Breaker bar
Ratchet
Floor jack
Jack stands
approx 5' pipe to fit over handle of breaker bar

1. Jack the car and place jack stands under rear torsion tube.
2. Place floor jack on banana arm just below 22mm bolt holding lower shock
.. Raise till arm just moves.
3. Use breaker bar, 22mm socket, 5' pipe to crack the nuts loose.
4. Use breaker bar to loosen nut enough so that it can be backed out with
ratchet.
5. Warm up, stretch out back of legs and lower back.
6. Start on left side and remove upper shock mounting nut by holding the
shock with 7mm wrench while turning nut with 17mm.
     (Note, my Boge shocks had 7mm fitting, but the Bilsteins liked the 6mm
better)
7. Remove air cleaner cover. Can't recommend procedure to unsnap the lower
rear clip. My small arms just barely fit back far enough to reach it.
8. Repeat step 5.
9. Repeat step 6.

I gave the bolts a liberal blast of WD40 2 nights before and the 22mm bolts
came out pretty smoothly, although I not sure if it helped or I was just
lucky. One other tip I picked referenced the use of small yield nuclear
devices to loosen the nut, but I was concerned about my paint...
