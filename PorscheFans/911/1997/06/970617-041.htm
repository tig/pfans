> Fred, you may be suffering from a case of the thermostat probe not in
> contact with the coil.  This causes the evap coil to freeze up and that
> makes the air gop around the coil and come out warm. First try turning
> the 'temp' knob to the left about 1/3 to 1/2 the way from the right
> stop.
> 
> You should be abe to detect the compressor cycle at a steady speed.  If
> you don't feel or hear the clutch go off then back on again in a minute
> or so then I would say that the thermostat in not senseing the temp of
> the coil.  Under the front hood is a compartment for the a/c, open this
> door and find the probe that comes from inside and coils around and
> sticks into the coil thru a hole in the evap box. Carefully pull this
> TUBE up and out of the coil. It is a tube with R-12 inside so don't kink
> this tube. Take some fine sandpaper, polish the end up to where it was
> in the coil then push it carefully back into the coil.  Repeat the test.

> Let me know what happens....Roger
