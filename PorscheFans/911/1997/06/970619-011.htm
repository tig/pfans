Don't know what year your car is but mine didn't have rear speakers at all
and the puny door speakers don't cut it.  After I experimented with a SAS
8" sub, besides being too bulky to fit gracefully, it sounded too boomy so I
returned it.  I already had a decent pair of 6x9s but didn't want to 
hack up the
rear deck so I bought 2 6x9 speaker enclosures for $19.99 from JC Whitney,
installed a small 45x2 W amp under the passenger floorboard and I have decent
sound for < $100.   I don't use the rear seats, the boxes are strapped 
in with the seat
belt, hidden from view with the seatbacks down and are easily removed 
if I need to
use the seats or when I snap in harnesses.  If you really want more 
bass, a stereo
installer told me to install 2 8" or 10" subs on the rear floor but 
then you'd need
amps/crossovers etc.   I wanted to keep it simple and inexpensive.
