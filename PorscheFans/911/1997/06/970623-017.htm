Steve:
Considering your financial situation you probably cannot afford to 
upgrade to a 911sc, and the earlier models have mechanical problems of 
their own. You may simply be tranferring your minor problems to 
potentially more serious and expensive ones.
Since you know your present car and the 'challenges' are only cosmetic 
and not mechanical I would seriously consider staying with this car and 
fixing it up. Keep it for a year or two, then move up. 

Also...I don't think a cheap paint job will fool a Porsche buyer, or 
really pay back. If you do decide to sell it, I wouldn't sink any more 
money into the car.
