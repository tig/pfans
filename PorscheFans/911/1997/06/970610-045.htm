Paul,

My car is a beauty - It is Guards Red.  It has been de-chromed and looks
stunning because of it - many people think it is much newer - it is very
straight and the interior original.  The doors have rust blisters - I was/am
planning on replacing the skins.

The motor has been totally rebuilt (in 1993):
- upgraded 2.7 Nikasil (RS) Pistons and barrels,  - taking it out to 2.5
litres
- re-ground "E" cams
- port and polished heads (and Block - YES the block)
- the heads have been tapped to adapt twin ignition - It needs the
distributor.
- It still has mechanical injection
- rebuilt transmission
- less than 1000 km since engine rebuild  
- All receipts for work (which was carried out by a local Porsche specialist)
- The front hydraulic suspension has been replaced with Bilsteins and the
rear with Konis

The only catch - The car is for sale in Australia....   I used to live there
and was not planning on selling it so I could use it when I returned.
 However I am now getting married in the US so am unsure of when I would get
to drive it again.  Hence the decision to sell it.  I had many offers to buy
it when I lived there but never intended to *ever*  do so - hence the
extensive (expensive) mechanical rebuild.
