Eric,

The factory suggest long oil change intervals. Virtually every member 
of the list changes oil and filters much more often. It is cheap 
insurance.  If anything really nasty happens to your 993 engine you 
could face a repair which is north of $20,000.  So, do like the rest 
of us and change the oil and BOTH filters every three months or 7500 
miles. More frequently if you attend track events.  It isn't cheap, 
expect the oil and filters to cost between 150-200 bucks. On the 
other hand that's 1 percent of the cost of a new engine.

Joe,
If you lower the car to euro height (about 1 inch lower than North 
American stock) the car will look like Porsche designed it.  You'll 
be ok on speed bumps and things but care will be required. If you 
drop it 1.5 inches then curbs, driveways and  speedbumps will be a 
major nuisance).  I have one of each, the 993 with the Eibachs looks 
really nice lowered about 1.5 inches but I have a few scrapes on the 
bottom.  Handling and ride are fine though. I believe that both 
Eibach and H and R have new springs which drop only 1 inch. Call 
Al Solarali at H and R Canada (see Pano ads). If you're near Toronto 
he can show you various setups including a killer setup of new 
springs and struts.  I used the Euro springs from Windward on my 4S. 
Lower one inch, ride and handling is fine. 

In Canada figure about 700-800 bucks for the whole deal, there is 
some labor involved in changing the springs and you'll need a 4 wheel 
alignment too. You may get a better deal, but your dealer will 
probably want something in this price range.

Bob
