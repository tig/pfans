Har har... As long as it isn't BLACK!!! ;^)

If anyone's looking for a BLACK '87 to '89 Carrera coupe, there seems
to be a zillion of 'em in Canada. Too bad I don't want a black car
otherwise I'd have had one months ago!!! Heck, if things had gone
right, I could have had a SILVER one months ago (but then you'd be
a pretty unhappy dude, wouldn't you, Richard? ;^)

Yup, very valid points. I don't yet know the service history of either
car, and am trying to find out.

I'm currently predisposed towards the '89 - it's now questionable whether
it actually HAS had any body damage - nobody knows yet (and, as I said,
I've yet to see either car).

;^)

Done and done.

Cheers!
