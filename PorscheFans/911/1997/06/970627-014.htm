Got this today and thought it was worthy of forwarding.  My apologies for
the lack of moto content.

>SPECIAL ALERT TO ALL NORTH CAROLINA NMA MEMBERS!!!!!
>
>
>Without any fanfare, the North Carolina Legislature is moving to saddle
>residents and visitors of your state with photo radar, red light cameras
>and every other form of camera-based revenue generation they can concoct.
>
>Senate Bill 741 has already passed committees in the Senate and the House.
>This is what it does:
>
>1) It allows photo enforcement in Charlotte (today Charlotte, tomorrow the
>rest of the state???)
>
>2) It holds the vehicle OWNER responsible for all photo-based tickets.
>
>3) The only practical defense is to offer up a friend or family member as
>the guilty party.
>
>4) It eliminates a defendant's right to a fair trial.  "Due process" is
>replaced with an administrative hearing system where the accused will have
>zero rights.
>
>5) They know motorists would vehemently expose this scheme if it involved
>the assessment of points, so all they want is to extract $50 per ticket.
>
>6) It will permit the city to ignore proper serving of summons. They can
>just send you the ticket in the mail.  If you don't receive the ticket,
>that's tough.  They bump it up to $100, and they can garnish your wages to
>get it.
>
>
>This is an out and out scam to extort money from motorists.  There is not a
>shred of legitimate evidence that photo enforcement improves highway
>safety.  So, what can you do?
>
>For starters, call (There's not enough time to write.) and let your state
>senator and representative know that you now know about Senate Bill 741.
>Tell them you don't like the idea of your hard-earned money being stolen
>through camera enforcement schemes.  Tell them you don't like having your
>right to a fair trial and due process being eliminated.  Tell them you
>don't like the state or the City of Charlotte pitting family members and
>friends against one another as the only way they can contest a traffic ticket.
>
>The general number for the legislature is 919-733-1110.
>
>You should also express your displeasure against Senate Bill 637, which
>will give the City of Charlotte authority to arbitrarily underpost speed
>limits on all streets, roads and highways within the city.
>
>This is a great one-two punch against motorists.  First, underpost the
>speed limits worse than they already are, and then roll out the photo radar
>cameras and rake in the money!  Next year, after the word gets out, every
>North Carolina city, village and town will want the same authority.
>
>Write your local newspaper and let them know what's going on, and why you
>don't want photo enforcement.  Ask your friends and family to express their
>opposition.  North Carolina is notorious for heavy handed, exploitive
>enforcement of traffic laws.  Given the revenue generation potential of
>photo enforcement schemes, there will be millions of dollars available to
>further harass and extort motorists who live and drive through the "road
>block" state.
>
>We're hoping you'll act now to stop this bill, as we don't have many
>members in North Carolina.  Don't assume the other members in your state
>will act.  Be sure and tell your friends about us.  We need all the help we
>can to fight this.  
>
>James Baxter, President
>National Motorists Association
>
>
>
>----
>Did you ever receive a traffic ticket you didn't deserve?   Have one now?
>We can help!
