I recently posted a message to the list.  It follows in part...

I love my 911 cab.  I've had it for three months now and I still get =
excited just looking at the car.  Does this feeling go away? =20

Apparently from all the responses I have received, the answer is a =
definite NO!  One that particularly made me roll on my office floor was =
a response by J. Horton.  He wrote...

	I've had my Targa for over a year now....And I still sometimes sit and =
stair at it.

Now I am wondering how many others have a staring relationship with =
their Porsche!  I'll admit that every time I walk by the car, I take a =
good long look (it's like in slow motion). I have sat and stared at it, =
I have sat in it and made driving sounds. I miss it when I am out of =
town (I travel way too much). I talk about the car like parents talk =
about their kids.  Its crazy, but I don't think I am the only one.  I =
had dreamed about owning one for almost ten years, it finally came true.

So here are some observations about the  experience with Barney The =
911...

Has anyone seen curves sweeter than those on a 911 rear fender flares?  =
(remember that these curves will never change with age)
The click of the door handle is like an invitation to enter the car (and =
leave the worries behind) .
The big tach, dead center!
The satisfying awkwardness of firing up the ignition with the left hand. =
=20
The rush of sweet music as the flat 6 comes to life.
The aroma of charred motor oil as you back-up
Hmmm  How did they position the turn signal so perfectly?
The tach needle rushes upward immediately as the gas pedal is lowered.
The on pour of power in first gear.
The shift from first to second...bamm... more power.
Are you listening to the engine? Shift.
Here is that gentle right hand curve, immediately followed by the sharp =
left hander. =20
Just noticed how fast the heart is pumping.
Wow, the tank is full.  Cellular is off.  Dinner's not till eight.  Keep =
going.


I had to share my love for the 911 with people who might understand.  =
This place seemed like a good candidate.  Now, how many are looking for =
their keys?

Later...

PS.  I am going through withdraw, Haven't seen it in almost two months.
