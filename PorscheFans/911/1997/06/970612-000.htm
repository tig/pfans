I was in Germany not too long ago and here's what I found out:  Avis rents
993's for about $150 U.S./day.  As far as I know they only rent coupes, no
cabs or turbos.  Hertz rents Boxters for about $200 /day.  You have to be
in one of the major cities to rent one such as Munich, Frankfurt, etc.  I
tried to rent one when I was over there, but Avis had about 5 993's that
were already reserved.  They told me to reserve one about 3 weeks in
advance next time.  I don't know if there is an additional charge for
mileage, but the gas is about $4-5/gallon, and with the opportunity to put
the pedal to the medal on the autobahn, gas goes fast...trust me I know!
No matter what the cost, it's worth it though...atleast once.  Good luck
and by the way don't even think about renting one in Berlin unless you'd
fancy the East German Trabant (about 50 hp!).  They haven't quite caught up
with West Germany, but they've come a long way.

Have fun,
