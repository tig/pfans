I was told that the clutches that Sachs makes for the Porsche factory
are not identical to those it makes for the wholesale parts
distributors. This person told me that the factory "genuine" clutches
were of a tighter tolerance than the wholesaler's "OEM" clutches. I
wonder if there is any truth to this? If so, it would certainly explain
why some sources (like a p-car dealer) would be so much higher than a
mail order place.

Another point to consider is that most mechanics get their parts from
local jobbers. The jobber offers a number of conveniences that make the
mechanic's life easier including free delivery, usually on the same or
next day and no-hassle exchange for incorrect parts. They also carry
accounts for the mechanic and do monthly billing. Now because the jobber
must keep a large inventory and doesn't move the volume that a mail
order place does, their prices are going to be higher. I also imagine
that places like Vertex import directly from Germany whereas a local
jobber is most likely going to order from a national distributor which
adds another middleman.

Even though most Porsche mechanics enjoy their work, they still need to
make a living. There are a lot of hidden expenses that eat into the
hourly rate and parts markup. I just bought a wrench off of a Snap-On
truck the other day. Wow, are professional tools expensive! The point
here is that I have never seen a Porsche mechanic whom I would call
wealthy. Most give a good effort to earn their income although I am sure
that there are a few that are dishonest or unscrupulous. Avoid the
latter, of course.

At any rate, does anyone know if there is any truth to the assertion of
the first paragraph above? Or is this just marketing hype to justify
higher prices?
