Alex, last year I had to take the face off my tach.  The face is a conc=
ave
piece of thick plastic, and in my case it was touching the tach needle =
when it
was hot outside, keeping the needle from moving.  I fixed this by rever=
sing the
face.  Below is a long post of what I did to remove the face.  This tec=
hnique
would probably work with the other gauges.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------------------------------------
With my SC, it was hard to get the tach out, because the steering colum=
n was in
the way.  I finally worked it out of the dash by pulling it out to the =
left
side of the column.

Slide off the rubber ring that held the tach in the dash.  Put the tach=
 face
down on a soft towel.  You'll see that the black trim ring is crimped t=
o the
grey-metal tach body.  If you follow the crimp around the cirmumference=
, you
should be able to find a place where there is a space between the crimp=
 and the
tach body where you can fit a small screwdriver blade.  Carefully pry u=
p the
crimp at this point.  Keep working all the way around.  You can raise t=
he crimp
to about a 60 degree angle this way, but that's not enough to slide off=
 the
trim ring.

You need to get the crimped part completely vertical to get the trim ri=
ng off,
which is hard to do with the screwdriver.  I have a small 1/4-inch open=
 end
wrench (Craftsman) where the open end is perpendicular to the wrench ha=
ndle, as
opposed to in-line with it.  Hold the wrench open end down and hook the=
 jaw
over the crimp.  By lifting the wrench handle, the open end of the wren=
ch
pivots against the tach body and the jaw pries the crimp out further.
Carefully work around a couple of times and you should be able to then =
slide
off the trim ring, along with another circular metal piece that holds d=
own the
face (I didn't know it was there until I got the trim ring off).

The tach face may be firmly stuck to the tach, but gentle prying got mi=
ne off.
The side facing the needle is pretty convex.  Place it down on a flat s=
urface
and you'll be surprised by how much.  Clean the glass, reverse it, and =
then
carefully slip the trim ring and other circular metal piece back on.  T=
his may
take some more fiddling with the crimp.

Now you have to push the crimp back down.  I used the screwdriver to pu=
sh it
back down as far as I could.  Scratches on the crimped part are OK, as =
they
will be hidden, but be careful the screwdriver doesn't slip and scratch=
 the
side of the trim ring.  To get the final crimping done, use a pair of p=
liers
with parallel jaws, like Channelocks.  Put several layers of duct tape =
on the
jaw that contacts the visible outer part of the trim ring, or you'll de=
nt it (I
did slightly until I added more tape).  Then just work around, slowly a=
nd
carefully squeezing down the crimp.

Put it back in the dash and you're done.  I haven't had the problem sin=
ce.
Seems tedious, but really well worth it.  Reversing the lens has no aff=
ect on
the appearance of the tach.

Hope this helps!
