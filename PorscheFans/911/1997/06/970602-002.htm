Thanks Ted,
It's too late to buy used, and I'm not sure I would buy a used thermostat
anyway.  Especially since it was such a pain to replace, requiring the
entire rocker assembly be removed and then the multiple oil lines.  I also
found my new thermo -08 had an oil input pipe 4mm larger OD than stock, and
the flexible oil hose did NOT want to fit correctly without forcing it.
The new unit is a much better design for this modification, however.
Good Luck, ChrisK.




Chris,
  I asked my mechanic the same question today as we looked at the used B&B
oil cooler, porsche hard lines and thermo we will be installing next week,
and he says that over many many years, he has only replaced a half-dozen or
so thermostats, the original porsche ones are usually OK even used, but if
they do go bad, it is easier to replace than to fix.
