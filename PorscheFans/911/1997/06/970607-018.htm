Yes Brian they are, and if you persist with this line of discussion we 
will be forced to have the humor police pay you a little visit. Apology 
not accepted... you can however, send money.

I agree, except for the part about the spellink and grammer... and some 
of the other stuff too.

>and leave out our home/business addresses, phone numbers, E-mails, and 
>the little personal quotes such as "Dear Santa, All I want for 
>Christmas is your list of naughty girls."  (Which I liked, BTW)

Damn those Christians... it's time to put the Santa back in Christmas. 

As long as you are prepared to 'take' as good as you 'give', then I 
agree with the magnificent Bette Midler, who in her caustic glory days 
summarily dismissed her critics with the phrase: "F*ck'em if they can't 
take a joke!"
