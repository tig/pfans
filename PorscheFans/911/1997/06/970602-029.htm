To Bob:
I would not suggest using any mount to hold the entire weight of a 911
engine (with intake, exhaust, etc.) that is not designed to hold a 911
engine.  It may have worked for you one time, but there is a tremendous
risk involved.  It is not just the bolt pattern that you should be
concerned with, but the extra strength that the half-moon lip on the
engine head gives the mount where it seats against the crankcase half. 
If you look at the case, there is a recessed area that the engine head
fits precisely against, thus giving the real strength to the fixture. 
Have you ever seen a 911 motor drop onto the floor from a poor
mount...not a pretty sight.  If you are just doing a crankcase only,
maybe an "american" style is ok...just "maybe".  Maybe you will get
lucky with the full weight...maybe not.  Especially with the mag.
cases...those threads can pull right out of the case!!

I have dropped two motors with mounts that were "made for" the 911
without the special lip (this was before I knew better).  I have
probably built 50-60 engines with the correct engine head...no problems.
Be safe...proper 911 engine mounts are the best and safest way to go.
