Hmmm - if the threads are buggered they'll certainly be weaker. Running
a tap through, quite apart from any other problems it may cause (which I
believe includes weakening the threads even further), will surely deposit
bits of aluminum in your combustion chamber.

It will put a nice dent in your right fender when it blows out at high speed,
and will bugger the threads even more!

Disclaimer... I'm not an expert in this - I would say, however, that the
"correct" fix would be to pull the head off & have a time-cert inserted.
Much $$$. I don't know if there's an "acceptable" cheaper solution.

Others, I'm sure, will also offer advice... 

Cheers,

Ross
