 I'm helping out a friend who would like to know the relative merits of chips
 for the 993 twin turbo.  So far the options that have appeared are 
 
 a) the Automotion Weltmeister 60-70 hp chip upgrade for around $3,000 
 b) the Autothority 100 hp chip upgrade for around $7,800.
 
 I know someone who put the Autothority chip in a twin turbo and he said it
 was "brutally fast."
 
 Any experience out there with these silicon wonders?
 
 For those of you who know me, no I have not bought a 993 twin turbo!  I
 still adore my C4S, and, until I feel I have learned to outdrive it
 (unlikely) I will not be doing any major mods.
 
 Thanks.

 ==================================

Donna,

I was just at a track event at Mid-Ohio and a guy with a 1996 993
Turbo had the autothority kit and has had problems getting it to work.
Don't know anything about the automotion kit.  There is another company
called quick chips??  that you send your computer to and they reprogram
it and gain about 40 to 50 horsepower for $2000.00 don't know anything
about them.  For 993 Turbo's you can't just add a chip anymore you have
to reprogram the computer.
