Some observations on the ongoing discussions on this topic:

1) The brake cleaners you can buy in stores seem to do a pretty good
job:  they claim to be formulated so nothing incompatible with brake fluid
is left behind, and they seem to evaporate without leaving any nasty
residue of their own once they have flushed out what you were trying to
get rid of.  In fact, I like them so much I use any time I am cleaning oil or
grease off of metal, and blow dry with air (be careful here, as blowing
some into an eye is painful, especially with contacts).

2) While the ATE steel angle finders (one front, one rear) some of the
catalog houses sell may be overkill for getting the angle right enough for
the purpose, they are certainly convenient, as they can be wedged in
gently and will turn the piston to the correct angle with less sweat and
worry than other methods.

3) The most important thing to remember when using air to pop the
pistons out (the most convenient system by far) is to keep your fingers
out of the caliper when applying it!

4) Dust boots are certainly in order, but racing sure shortens their useful
life.  I suspect they are most vulnerable when pads are new and thick,
as there is less room for the compressed boot to live in than later when
the piston sticks out farther.  Of course, racing/time trialing leads one to
replace pads more often also.

5) Now, a question.  Dust boots seem to come in two styles: a)  one has
two parts - a rubber? boot, and a ring-like clip, sort of like a skinny split
washer.  These I have found pretty easy to install - put on the boot, work
its outer edges over the part which holds it in place, and put the clip over
that to keep it there.  The clip is stiff but not so much it can't be spread
apart easily to accomplish this.  I have been able to install these without
removing the caliper, though it was not as easy.    b) The other style is
one piece, with some sort of reinforcing ring moulded into the base of the
boot.  When it is forced down it holds itself in place.  These are
aggravation personified, at least for me.  Press down on one side, the
other goes up.  Use of tools, more force, etc. usually leads to damaging it
before it has even been installed.  Maybe somewhere there is a tool
which allows even (and pretty strong) pressure to be applied all around
its circumference?

How can I insure that the caliper repair kits I order are always the first
kind, and not the second?  Or does the second kind give superior
service, not burn through at the creases, and I just need some special
tool?
