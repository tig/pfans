I hate to beat this horse any further, but here's another perspective
on the buy-your-own-parts vs let-the-mechanic-screw-you issue:

I do most of the work on my own cars.  There is a small shop here
in town that specializes in Porsches.  I try to buy as many parts as
I can from this shop (even if I have to pay more for the stuff than if
I mail-ordered it myself) for a couple of reasons.  I think it is nice
to have the shop here in town (if they don't make money, they go
out of business - no more shop...I should also add that here in
North Alabama, Porsche shops are few and far between).  I like
having the comfort having a shop here in town.  Also, I've found
that treating these folks (the shop's run by a husband/wife) like
this, they have been *very* helpful to me over the years.  Like 
showing me how to do things, or giving me tips on how to get
things apart, etc.

Maybe this is a naive viewpoint, but to me, it's worth paying a
little extra...I think in the long run, you get what you pay for...
