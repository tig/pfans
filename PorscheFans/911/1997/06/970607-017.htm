Wow, and I thought I was the only one that has had frustrating
experiences with mechanics...

I know this thread has been hyperextended, but you've got to hear this
one:

I bought my '70 911T this last February.  It was all original, with
87,000 original miles.  It ran reliably, but leaked oil/fuel and would
not pass the smog test (at the time, I didn't know that the car never
REALLY would).  Anyway, I found a local mechanic with whom I felt
comfortable. (This is my first Porsche)  Basically, he was articulate,
claimed he had once been the service manager at a dealership, been in
business for six years, had a small, clean shop with a few Porsches
being worked on, and best of all he seemed eager to work on my car. 
(The reason that qualification was most important to me is that prior to
meeting him, several mechanics that had been recommended to me flat out
said that they weren't interested in working on my year Porsche!!) 
Anyway, I gave this guy my car.  He looked it over, over a period of a
couple days(for free) and called me with a list of stuff that needed to
be fixed.  I went to the shop and he showed me what he found. (At this
point I was really feeling positive about things)  First on the list,
the carbs were in really bad shape, so he suggested that they be sent
out for an rebuild (est - $800-$1100)  He said it would take about 2
weeks.  I agreed.

Now things get interesting.

After three weeks had passed, and following much delay from the carb
shop, the carbs returned and were installed.  There was a problem. 
There was now a ticking noise coming from the left side of the engine. 
He said that maybe a tensioner was failing, or perhaps...something had
fallen into one of the cylinders.  At this point he assured me that if
something had fallen into the cylinder, any damage suffered would be
fixed at no cost to me.  I agreed to let him investigate.  He did a
compression test and found a leak in one of the cylinders on the left
side.  The carbs/head was removed and low and behold, an adjustment
screw from the old carb had fallen in.  The exhaust valve was bent and
there were several dents on the head.  He suggested that it wouldn't be
a bad time to do valves/heads/rings on all of cylinders.  He said he
would cover all labor and pay for the valve/head on the damaged
cylinder.(what a deal)  He said that the job would be done in a week. 
He also said that considering that the engine was out of the car, and
that it had to be to work on the clutch, it might not be a bad time to
replace it.(the clutch was really bad)  Est: clutch - $1000,
valves/rings/seals/hoses - $800,  Total time estimate: 1 week.  I
agreed.

4 weeks and many phone calls/visits later,

Everything was done, but there was a problem...The ignition box was
failing intermittently.  Also, a hole appeared in the muffler.  Est:
ignition box - $1200, muffler - $800.  Now, having been a home mechanic
for several years (on lesser makes) and generally prudent about business
matters, I decided to check a couple parts retailers.  I found permatune
ignition boxes for $250 and OE mufflers for $250!!!!  I was pretty
angry.  I told him I didn't want a new muffler and that I wouldn't pay
over $250 for an ignition box.  He was actually SURPRISED by my
reaction!!!  At this point I went to his shop and had a heart to heart
with him.  I let him know how frustrated I was and that I was beginning
to not trust him.(he had been working on my car for almost 2 months!) 
He said that he would loan me an ignition box from his shop and that he
would take care of getting my smog certificate, the car would be ready
the next day.

2 days later,

The car was ready, but there was a problem.  The car wouldn't pass the
smog test and the oil pressure guage and alternator circuit were not
operating.  He said that he would figure out the problem and call me the
next day.  It turned out that the oil pressure sender was not operating
and the alternator needed a rebuild.  He would continue to tweak the
carbs in order to pass smog.  Time estimate: 2 days

4 days later,

All was fixed, the smog certificate had been achieved.  With relief, I
went to pick up the car.  I noticed that my car had a new muffler!  When
I asked him about it, he said that the car needed it and he had gotten
one for $200, so he had put it on without my permission.  Anyway, he
said, pay me what you can right now and we'll worry about the rest
later.  I gave him $3000 and told him he would get the rest when he
provided me with a final invoice. (According to him, I still owe about
$1000).  I've called him a couple times in an attempt to pay off my
balance and he claims that he is still trying to knock money off the tab
and that a final invoice has yet to be tabulated.

Two months have passed and I have yet to hear from him.  My engine is
nearing it's first service interval and it's almost time to go back.

Should I assume that this guy is trying to help me out by not pushing
the money thing, and I should continue on with him (considering
mechanics that do good work are hard to find) or is this guy a bad apple
and I should take my chances elsewhere?

If you managed to stay awake through this whole thing, please let me
know what you think.
