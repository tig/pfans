I have a couple of comments regarding mechanics using parts from the owner.
 I have a great mechanic with tons of Porsche experience (as well as Ferrari,
Lambo, Alfa, and other exotics) who has no problem using parts that I give
him, as long as they are good quality parts.

In my most recent experience, I had to have a surprise brake job performed
the day before my last track event.  I knew I was going to need brakes soon,
and had already bought the parts from a mail-order place.  When I had the car
inspected, he found that while my pads were fine, my rotors were very worn
and were undersized.

Since I had to work that day and didn't have time to do it myself, I went
home, got the parts, and arranged to leave the car with him.  He charged me
only for his labor and a wheel bearing (which he felt should be replaced, but
I did not have).

He also said that since my rotors were the same brand he uses if I wanted, I
could have him do the work with his parts, then restock his parts with mine.
 The reason I didn't do this was that I wanted to use my Cool Carbon pads and
he only had stock pads in stock.  Hence the trip home to get my parts.

I have also used him as a parts supplier for jobs that I do myself, since he
always seems to match the prices I find in Pano.  He will even let me call to
ask questions when I am not sure of what to do.

When I did my clutch job myself, I brought the car to him afterwards and had
him inspect my work to make sure I didn't miss anything.  Of course, I paid
him for his help.

I have even had him diagnose stuff that I did not intend to have him fix.  I
pay him for his time, then take the car and fix the problem myself.  He knows
that I like to do my own work when I can, but sometimes don't have the
experience to find the hard problems.  That is one way I enjoy my car, is
working on it.

Ok, last comment.  I saw another post regarding this issue with someone in
the computer industry.  I also do computer repairs & consulting in my spare
time.  The reason people come to me is because I diagnose/suggest what they
should do, then let them get the parts themselves, or order the parts for
them.  I make $0.00 on any parts.  Since I can't compete with local shops
(Comp USA) or mail order prices, I don't.  I'm simply not in the computer
parts business.  I make my money from my knowledge and experience in
configuring/repairing systems.

I feel that being a car mechanic is no different.

Quite honestly, if he said HE couldn't even get the parts as cheap as YOU
can, then he is not looking too hard and I would find another mechanic.  He
is not competetive.  And in todays world, if you can't compete, then you
lose.  Part of being a good service person is offering good service.  If he
chooses not to spend the time to find a cheaper supplier for his parts so
that his customers can save some money, then why should you pay more?

Ok, I'm done.
