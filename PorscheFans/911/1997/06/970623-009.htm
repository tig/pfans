Please reply to me directly (as well as to the list) cuz I am on digest =
version.

This weekend, on the freeway, the car lost power (but was still running) =
 While looking for a place to merge right,  everything cleared up and =
remained OK for the rest of the trip (Sat morning shopping...)

I felt like I was running out of gas, but I did have half a tank.

Anyway, it happened the next day also - the car will run but I could =
barely keep it going at 30 mph.  This time the loss of power lasted much =
longer ( a minute)  but miraculously disappeared completely and the car =
ran fine the rest of the way home.  It SEEMS to be fine once it gets up =
to operating temp.

I seem to remember something about this from previous threads - is it =
the cylinder head temp sensor?  BTW, my car just turned 34 (k) this =
weekend and is otherwise in good tune.

Thanks!
