This is a weird one. The dealer service dept. has an explanation that is plausible,
but seems unlikely. Maybe someone here knows?

While on a local PCA chapter 'Spring Tour', there were three 911s in a row:
1.	1997 C4
2.	1990 C4 (mine)
3.	1992 C4 (Jim's)

It was noted by the driver of a 911 behind Jim that while the electric spoilers of
#1 and #2 extended more or less in sync (up at about 50 mph, down at 6 mph), that of
Jim's car seemed to have a mind of its own, going down at times when speeds were in
the 60 mph range, and back up again at speeds below 50 mph. When Jim asked the
service dept. at the local Porsche dealership 'what the heck is going on with this
thing?', he was told that the 1992 model year (and maybe another year or two?)
spoiler was controlled by a combination of speed and engine heat, whereas earlier
964 models years (mine) and later models had vehicle speed as the sole controlling
factor.

Can anyone confirm that this is indeed the case?

Thanks
