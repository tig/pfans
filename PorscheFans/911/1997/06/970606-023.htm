     Doh!  Now I did it.  I was changing my plugs last night.  Had some 
     trouble with #5 plug.  I tried to thread it nice and easy by hand but 
     could only get it in about one turn and then it tighten up.  So I 
     tightened it a couple more turns with the wrench.  I noticed that when 
     I removed the old plug it unscrewed like 
     this...easy....hard.....easy.....hard......easy....etc..  Was 
     something caught up it the threads maybe.
     
     Going to the hardware store to buy a 14mm x 125 tap.  What does the 
     list recommend in this situation.  Surely someones had this problem 
     before, or am I the only dope.

     PS- Is there any danger driving the car with the plug in only a few 
     turns?
