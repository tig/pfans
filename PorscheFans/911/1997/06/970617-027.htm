I bought an '84 Cab this past January. It had 32k miles on it, 16" C2
5-spoke wheels, the CHMSL from a later model Cab was installed, and the
car was clean throughout with an excellent (dark red) leather interior
and black top. It also has a nice Momo wheel and a newer Blauplunkt
Orleans stereo w/CD. I paid $26,000. I have been looking semi-seriously
for the last few years and I wasn't going to buy until later this year,
but this car came up so I went for it. The previous owner is the
President of the bank I work for, so I got at least a year's worth of
history, plus some (but not all) old service records. I bought it from a
dealer (Blue Grass Automotive) and Jack had traded the car for $25,000
for a very low mile '95 993 Cab. Also, the 30k service had been recently
done.

I originally was going to look for an '87-'89 Cab, as these don't go for
much more money ($25K-$35K max). They have a few other features, like the
short shift (came in '85), 14 more hp, slightly larger brakes & clutch,
power seats (nice) and top (don't care about...one more thing to break).
I had looked at & driven a few others, but cars that aren't always kept
indoors show it with faded trip, warped/cracked dashes and package
shelves (in Targas). Personally, I wouldn't have paid extra money for a
very low mileage car, as I plan on driving 5-7k a year and I feel very
low mileage cars can have age/lack of use problems. I'm very happy with
the purchase, I only have minor things to fix, like a new gas strut to
hold up the rear lid, windshield washers don't work (PO never drove in
the rain & didn't know) and the power antenna doesn't work, although I
pull/push it manually so I may never fix it.
