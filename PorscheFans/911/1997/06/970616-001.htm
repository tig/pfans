I apparently have a problem with my windscreen wipers, which cannot be =
turn-off any more. I have checked the switch on the steering wheel, and =
according to me it seems alright. I then read some think about this =
problem on "Poormans Porsche" site, which indicate that it could be the =
intermittent wiper unit (911.618.149.01). There was no way that it was =
possible for me to reach in through the dashboard, so I had to go the =
way of the luggage compartment (you learn a lot doings this, as the =
above sites says).=20

I have checked the Blue/White wire (31b) between the wiper motor and the =
intermittent control unit, the connection seems fine. I also checked the =
ground wire on both the wiper motor and the control unit, they also both =
seems fine. I also cleaned all the outside contacts and the relay =
contacts inside, but nothing seams to help.

My question is now to everybody on the list whether they have a good =
idea for a test setup of this control unit or a complete wiring diagram =
of the control unit.=20

In advance thanks!
