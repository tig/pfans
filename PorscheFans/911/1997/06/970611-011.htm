Guys,

Thanks for the replies on the air compressor.  I'm going to stick with
the cr*ppy Kmart special, as I'll probably never need it.  The garage
compressor filled the tire pretty quick, and it seems to hold air, so
I'm happy.  As was noted, it didn't completely shrink back down though.
Sometime this weekend, I'm going to use that self expanding foam (for
home insulation) to make a little "fitted case" to hold the compressor
and some misc tools inside the spare tire.  At least it won't rattle
around that way.

Now why the heck did Porsche build those things like tanks?  Those
spares must have the density of lead; I think my spare weighs as much
as a pair of Fuchs, or so it seems.....

Mike
