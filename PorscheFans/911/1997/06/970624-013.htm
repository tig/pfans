          I can't comment directly on the Vancouver, but I did
          recently replace my stock Reno with a Denver.  I replaced
          all the speakers with new Blau units at the same time.  The
          sound is much improved over the Reno but ambient engine
          noise and the crappy windshield antenna ('87 coupe) don't
          help.  The most remarkable thing about the Denver (and
          possibly the Vancouver) is the ridiculous control scheme.
          Every button has a couple of functions and some functions
          are duplicated.  Adjusting the tone control while driving
          for instance is nearly impossible.  The charming thing about
          it though is you get to mount it next to the equally
          impossible climate controls.  I think the Germans are saying
          "Drive the car, everything else is peripheral nonsense."

          If the ride wasn't so great, I'm not sure how many of us
          would put up with airplane movie quality sound and air
          conditioning that only works well when it's cold outside.
          And that's, of course, when the heater doesn't work well.

          I love my car, I'm not crazy, I love my car, I'm not
          crazy...

          Dennis Dodd
