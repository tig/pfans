Hello P-Fans,
I am writing to you folks needing legal help/advise in the Indianpolis area
on getting an idividual to send back my deposit on a 72 911.

To make a long story short. I saw and in Hemmings for a "totally restored 72
911 S". This was the April 97 issue. I called and talked to the individual
who gave me a "complete" rundown on his car. I was told there was much
interest in the car and he potentially had people flying in from all over
the states to see the car, and that if I were truly interested I should act
quickly. Pictures were Fed-x'ed to me and the car looked nice. I was told
the only way that he would hold the car for me was if I sent a deposit. I
asked for the VIN number. He did'nt have it, but said he would get it and
call me back. He did and in fact the VIN number checked out to be a 72 911S.
Good enough for me. I Fed-x'ed a cashiers check for $2000.00. Which he
recieved the next day and cashed.

That weekend I drove to Indianapolis from Milwaukee, WI., excited about my
first 911. Met the individual for brunch and drove to his storage facility
to see the 911. As soon as he opened the door, the pristine 72 911S as he
described presented itself as a 72 911T with all the S badges. I looked at
all the VIN tags and they were not the same number as I was given on the
phone but that of a 72 911T. 

I told the individual that this car was not an S, but a T and I was not at
all interested in a T. He claimed to know nothing about this and he was
quite upset, feeling he had been taken be the Porsche dealership in North
Carolina were he had bought it as a 911S. When asked about the difference in
the VIN number hegave me over the phone and the actual VIN on the car he
could'nt explain, other than he had gotten it off a "piece of paper" not the
title as he had previously told me. I politely asked for my deposit back.
Well, he said could'nt do that because he had thought this was a "done deal"
and had already cashed my cashiers check and did not have it on his person.
He said he would Fed-x it back to me on Monday. Not feeling as if I had any
options on a Sunday and having to be back at work on Monday morning, I made
him sign a promisory note stating he would completely refund my deposit.

As you can guess after two months, I have yet to see my deposit. He has not
returned any of my phone calls. My attorney has written him and recieved a
response of yes I have the money, but I'm here in Indiana and you are in
Wisconsin what are you going to do about it. But, he has stated that he he
would send my deposit back when he sold the car.

I have spoken to the asst. prosecutor in this persons area, who has been
helpful, but I can tell it's really not going anywhere. I just spoke to the
president of the Indiana region PCA. He actually went to see the same car a
week before I saw it and told the individual the same thing as I did. And
that if he continued to advertise the car as an S he would run into problems!

To me this is a crime. If I was given the actual VIN for the vehicle, I
would have NEVER sent a deposit and would have gone on my merry way. Can
anyone out there help me with advise on this? This whole thing just makes me
ill. And I feel quite helpless. I have since seen this 911 advertised in
Pano as a 911S, but with the correct VIN number. How many other people has
this guy screwed?

Any help on this matter would greatly be appreciated!

Best Regards,
