"I realize the mechanics have to make a living but it really frosts me to buy 
a part from the mechanic for $833 when he could buy it for $479, mark it up 
considerably and still make a profit. The bottom  line is now I have a 
mechanic working on my car who is pissed off at me. Anybody ever find 
themselves in the same position?" 
 
Yup...he's probably still pissed off but is no longer working on my car!!  
That's the difference.  Reasonable markup on parts is to be expected.  I 
assume my mechanics get 10-20%.  60% is unreasonable.  Dump him!!!!

As I previously have written, I purchased a 1987 Targa after a pre buyers
inspection that I probably could have done better myself even though I know
next to nothing about Porsches. Among other things the car needs a clutch
with a clutch update that came in the form of a service bulletin and has to
do with the throwout bearing and the shaft, etc. I discussed with the
mechanic that I had seen original equipment Sachs for sale at companies
advertised in Excellence for $479 and he said that he could get me one from
his source in that price range. Today he faxed me an estimate for the work
with $833 the price for the clutch. I called and told him I was very unhappy
with that and he said that I had better go ahead and buy the clutch through
my source. I spoke with him later and he said he was very upset because I
was cutting into his profits and had caused a mess in his schedule
(neglecting to mention that the day he scheduled my work the car sat
untouched for the entire day) while we waited for my parts. He also insists
that it won't be the proper clutch. To make a long story shorter and get to
my question: Do all Porsche mechanics refuse to let customers buy their own
parts. With all the companies selling parts in Excellence I find it hard to
believe that they are advertising to only mechanics and do-it-yourselfers. I
realize the mechanics have to make a living but it really frosts me to buy a
part from the mechanic for $833 when he could buy it for $479, mark it up
considerably and still make a profit. he bottom  line is now I have a
mechanic working on my car who is pissed off at me. Anybody ever find
themselves in the same position?
