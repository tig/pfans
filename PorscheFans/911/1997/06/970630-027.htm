A few comments on this recent thread.

1) Someone said it was "stupid" to use hot soapy water to clean the
calipers.  There's nothing wrong with cleaning them, or just about
anything else, with hot soapy water as long as you dry them off.
In fact, it's a very good way to get things nice and clean.

2) Someone suggested a grease gun as an alternative way to remove
the pistons.  It is, but you then have to clean out the grease.  Another
way to get the pistons out is to use the brake system itself, which, after
all, is made to move the pistons.  There have
been occasions when I've had to turn to this method as a last resort,
when my puny 100 psi compressor just couldn't hack it. Slip the
caliper off the disc, but leave it attached to the brake line.  Step
on the brake, and the piston will pop right out.  If you do it
carefully and gently you won't even lose that much fluid.

3) Someone suggested using brake assembly paste (rubber grease, I
assume) rather than brake fluid when assembling. I've never
understood why brake assembly paste would be a better
lubricant than brake fluid for the piston seals.  The seals ride
on a film of brake fluid, don't they?  The assembly paste is
nice to spread around the outside of the pistons after
they're inserted, filling the void under the dust boot.
It keeps everything in there moisture free.

4) Someone suggested that a really good job also included separating
the caliper halves.  I've always been told that this isn't necessary, and
probably not a good idea, because if you do need new seals, they are
hard to get.  The fact that they are not included in a rebuild kit
suggests that the halves should not be separated.

5) Someone mentioned that they had a precision thing-a-ma-bob made for
aligning the cut out on the piston, and someone else said they just use
a protractor, or a piece of cardboard cut at the right angle.
Cardboard's fine.  Doing it by eye is OK too.  This isn't a super-precise
adjustment.
