Hello,

I am apparently having a nightmare.  This may sound familiar, because I
posted to the newsgroup first.

I own a 1989 911 Cab.  It came with the original Fuchs, and now I want to
change them.  I bought a set of Replica 911 C2 Turbo 5 spoke wheels from a
place called the Tire Rack.  We gave the car specifications to the
salesman, and he assured us that the wheels he was sending would be
correct.

When we got the wheels and mounted them, everything seemed fine.  But as
soon as we drove the car, the wheels started hitting the fender and
subsequently tearing up the tires in the front (the rear was okay).

I took the car to my mechanic, and he put the wheels on his '87 cab,
getting the same results.  Apparently the offset is incorrect.

We are getting a refund on the wheels and tires, but now I can't find
anyone who will help me to get the wheels that I want.  

I was told by one store here (in Memphis, called the Connection) that this
problem happens to anyone who tries to use these replicas.  The salesman in
that store told me Friday to call him today, but I guess he is too busy to
make the sale, because he isn't coming to the phone.  Now he qualifies as
an official "weenie".

I just want to put 17 inch wheels on my car.  Can anyone give me the
specifications I need?  If I could get some advice from other late '80's
911 owners, I would be so very appreciative.

Here are the numbers of the wheels in question:

Original Fuchs:  Rear: 225/50 R 16V ; Front:  205/55 R 16V

New 5-spoke replicas: Rear:  255/40 R 17Z ; Front:  205/50 R 17Z.

If anyone can give me the exact numbers I need in order to put 17 inch
wheels on my car, I might actually come to your town and thank you in
person.  I have been told that I need to go from 50's to 55's in the front
(which I think is the ratio of diameter to width).  I have also been told
that I need to go from 8 to 7.5 (which I think represents width).  

Why is this so difficult?

Thanks in advance for helping me and patiently reading my problem.  Maybe I
should go see a psychologist or something. . .
