Have you done the 30K service on the car? That will include a new fuel
filter. If you haven't changed the fuel filter, I would do so right
away.

Do you carry a spare DME relay? I understand that they fail in weird
ways. If I recall correctly, I paid the dealer $45 for my spare. The
relay goes into a socket under the driver's seat and can probably be
replaced without pulling the seat.

This doesn't sound like the head temperature sender. When mine started
to fail, there was nothing intermittent about it. The car was hard to
start and ran very rough until it started to get warm. It is fairly easy
to check the sender with an Ohm meter. There are three plugs on a
bracket to the left of the heater blower on top of the engine. The top
plug is the head temperature sender. Pull it off and measure the
resistance to ground. If I remember correctly, it should be in the range
of 3K ohms cold and a couple of hundred ohms warm. Mine was in the
megohms cold and went to the normal range when warmed up. It was a bear
to replace. I fabricated a slotted deep socket to install the new one,
but it sure would have helped to have 3 elbows on each arm!

Good Luck!

Will I see you at the Vintage races at SIR on July 6th?
