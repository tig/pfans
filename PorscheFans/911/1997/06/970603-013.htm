Hi

possible reasons:

1. To prevent flat spotting of the tires during shipment and storage.
2. Tires might have been filled to correct pressure when the car was
outside in the cold of a German winter - air expanded in hot summer in
California after you heated the tires in your new car/ highway 101
exhuberance.
3. The factory tire filler had too many beers for lunch
