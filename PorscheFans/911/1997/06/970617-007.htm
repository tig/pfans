I had a broken Tenax on my cab's boot cover when I purchased it.  It 
was very simple to remove & replace.  There are two holes on the 
fastener's backing plate.  This backing plate screws onto the flange 
that makes up the female recepticle to sandwich the boot material 
between it and the fastener.   I used a pair of snap ring pliers, 
with the tips placed into these holes, to unscrew the backing plate 
from the fastener.  You then put the new Tenax through the now empty 
hole in the boot, and tighten down the backing plate on the new 
fastener.  It takes all of two minutes.

I think I paid about 8 bucks for a new fastener through my dealer.  
I'm sure mail order would be alot cheaper if you were already 
ordering some other goodies and didn't have to pay shipping on just 
the fastener.

Good Luck,
