To someone who asked about no-sunroof 911s...my C4S is sans sunroof.  And I
love it. You have to pay $5,000 down in a non-refundable deposit so be sure
you want it.  

You can get an extended fuel tank, too.  And lots of goodies dealers won't
tell you.

If any dealer tells you it can't be done, and several lazy ones will, change
dealers.  And if a dealer tells you the sport seats are carbon fiber, and
several will, change dealers.  And when they tell you...(I could go on here)

Porsche came in second at Helsinki - their first podium finish this year.
 Were they successful in getting the rules changed or are they finally
getting some success under the restrictor rules?
