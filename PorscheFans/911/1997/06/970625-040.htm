Nill,

I'll wholeheartedly second that!  It took me 6 months to find my 
perfect '88 cabrio, but it was worth it.  I have owned a coupe (no 
sunroof), a targa, and now a cabrio.  If you want a car to do track 
events, then don't buy a cab.  If however, you want a REAL sports 
car, than a cab is the only way to go.  No flames please, it's just 
that MY definition of a sports car, and I suspect Nill's too, is 
topless by definition.  It's my opinion, and I'm entitled.  You 
cannot become one with the road and your environment if you are 
isolated from it.

On the other hand, you will then have to have a separate, enclosed, 
track car for competitive purposes.  This has the advantage of being 
safer, having less chassis flex, and more room for sponsor's decals! 
;).  It works for me.  

Be patient, and keep looking for the car YOU want.  If you rush into 
something less than optimal, you will regret that purchase at some 
point.  Good luck.
