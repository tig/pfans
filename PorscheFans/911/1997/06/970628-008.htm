I have a few quibbles with the advise given on the caliper rebuilds.  Do
not spray WD 40 near the brake calipers - it attacks rubber, and over time
the seals will soften.  ATE sells a lubricant that is compatible with brake
seal rubber.  Also, I would recommend putting the dust shields on.  Water
getting into the crevice will cause corrosion.  I have never seen the dust
sheild melt,  but I have not raced the car in competition.

I just did my 81 911SC about a month ago, and I'm new to working on
Porsches.  First, remove the caliper and then get the bootie seal off,
or what's left of it. Notice the position of the pistons with the notch
at a 20 degree angle to the top of the caliper.  Ate makes a metal tool
to use to put in here.  I had one scribed and cut out for me.  This is
important and there were some questions a few weeks ago on here about
why this notch is here.  According to the guys at Performance
Engineering in Summit Point, WV, it is because of the rotating motion of
the rotor and how it puts pressure on the piston, thru the brake pads
that this is needed.  If this is not at the correct angle, it will bind
the piston during use.  If you don't have this tool, use the other
caliper as a guide and pray you get it close.  Do one caliper at a time
for this reason, so you remember which way it goes.

Put a rag for padding in between the two pistons.  Using compressed air
and a rubber tipped air nozzle inserted into the brake line inlet
(making sure the bleeder valve is shut) blow out one of the pistons. 
You don't have a choice here, the easiest one comes out first.  Now,
gently put it SLIGHTLY back in place, enough to make the seal.  Hold in
place with a C-clamp.  Now blow out the other piston.  You should be
able to wiggle the other piston back out.  This took me a few times back
and forth, what fun.

OK, you have the pistons out, now clean the whole caliper in HOT soapy
water and dry it quickly, so it doesn't start to rust from moisture. 
Use compressed air again to clean out the fluid passages.  Take the
pistons and GENTLY lift the old seal out.  Clean this piston good and
just slip the new seal on.  Wipe some new brake fluid inside the caliper
bore and some on the piston seal, to lubricate it for insertion.  Now
the trick is to put these pistons back in at that same 20 degree angle. 
It is also important to put these straight in, with no canting.  They
are a nice tight fit.  If you start to cant one, you'll have to put the
other one in, blow them out, etc.  Now I did all this with a small
125psi air tank that I used for topping off tires.  I had to go to the
gas station twice for refills.

If you are using these brakes for track use, do not put the rubber
bootie and it's metal clamp in place.  It is only going to melt, so
leave it off.  If you look at what you took off the car, you will see
what I mean.  What you want to do is spray some WD-40 around this
crevice so that the accumulated gunk will not adhere so well and it help
prevent piston sticking from the gunk.  Put the calipers back on the
car, bleed, etc.

This will take some time to do this.  It took me about 3 hrs a side,
because I am just learning this stuff.  If you have 4 piston calipers,
you're on your own.  That must be a pain.  Feel free to email me over
the weekend if you have further questions, even though I'll be at Summit
Point Raceway this weekend for the PCA Club Race on Saturday and driving
on Sunday.  Good Luck
