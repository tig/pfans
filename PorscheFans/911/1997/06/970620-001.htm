Ugh. When I bought my '88 Coupe about a month ago it had 6800 miles on
it. The dealer, as part of the purchase did a valve job just to ensure
everything was up to snuff (and because I complained that I thought I
heard valve noise during my test drives). The valve noise was not cured
by the original job and this week the dealer agreed to do the job again
(assuming they had missed a valve or something).

They did the work today, and claim that the valves are adjusted as they
should be. They claim that my valve guides look worn. This car now has
only 8400 miles on it!!! How could this be?!?!? 

The service manager's suggestion is that I just drive it like this for a
while and eventually get a top-end job done (~$2000!!! Eeeeek! My wife's
gonna kill me!).

Questions I asked, and answers I received:

Q: Will they get worse (I think the noise *has* gotten worse since I've
owned the car)?
A: Probably.

Q: When do I know I really need the top end job done? When the valves
get REALLY noisy? 
A: I don't have a good answer for you. Sorry.

Q: If they get worse, will they cause more damage (making a top-end job
even more expensive or even ruining the engine)?
A: Possibly.

Q: What should I do?
A: I really don't know. You need a top-end job.

Q: But the car only has 8400 miles on it!?!?
A: I know, I've never seen anything like this.

This bites. Does anyone have any opinions (stupid question for this list
<g>) on what I should do? I don't remember reading anything in the 1000s
of pages I've read about 911s where this era of car had any sort of
chronic valve guide problem. 

What could have caused the guides to wear like this?
