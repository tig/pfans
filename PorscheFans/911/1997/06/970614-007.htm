Reply from Bob:

I always thought (without really thinking that is, although it's
problematic as to whether really thinking would make much difference) that
the caliper pistons were  'recessed' to accomplish two things
simultaneously.  The recess results in applying slightly more force to the
trailing edge of the pad which prevents the pad from grabbing at the
leading edge, thus evening pad wear by preventing excess wear at the
leading edge, and also preventing squealing and chatter.  I hadn't thought
about heat.

Does anyone **really** know the answer?


Bob:  A Porsche mechanic from the Milwaukee area to me about the recessed
pistons.  Dean Fabritz from Fabson is the mechanic.  I don't want to take
credit for actually coming up with that explaination myself.
