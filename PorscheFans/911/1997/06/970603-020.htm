The A/C Evap/Blower draws its air from the right front passenger
footwell, through a hole cut in the "firewall" for this purpose.  (Or it
least it did on my '83 SC.)  So if you just reinstall the blower, you
will have a recirc system, with heat added to it by the blower motor and
resistor... not too satisfying on a hot day.  On my car I blanked off
the hole in the "firewall", which lets the blower draw from the front
wheel wells, through the steering rack tunnel... fresh, cool air, but
laced with brake pad and road dust.  To filter that stuff I installed a
rectangular Fram air cleaner on the blower; it fits pretty exactly where
the evaporator coils were -- I'll look up the Fram number if anyone's
interested.  The blower speed control resistors (coils of Nichrome) are
in the blower box and need to live in the moving airflow for heat
dissipation; if they get too hot there's a thermal cutout that disables
them.

This mod has worked well for me since I live in The Land That Summer
Forgot (central coastal CA) and seldom need A/C.  The airflow is pretty
laughable on my SC since the main dash vents are the size that modern
cars use for side window defrost. (Does anyone know what happened to the
Performance Aire retrofit kit?  They used to advertise in Pano.)
Losing the compressor from the tail was the biggest plus; it is amazing
how noticeable 50 lbs is that far back in the car.  If I had to do this
again I'd work a little harder to get fresh air to the blower from
somewhere else, like maybe the heater blower intake plenum.  With the
mod as I did it, it only takes a few minutes on a dirt road with the
blower on to load up the filter, and it's a bit of a chore to replace.

Hope this helps,
Ed
