hi Pfans............ today is the day before last day of my final exam. i
will go back to bangkok for a 3 months vacation. my 911 is in bangkok, so i
ordered some parts from PP. to bring it with me to fix my 911. 
i had my problem with my muffler order (i ordered it a month ago). they tell
me that the muffler will be backorder. i wait and wait until the week before
i go. i call them to check my order status. they said that muffler won't
come to US  (aluminize for 3.0SC), and the stanslessteel too. so i change it
to a regular steel (242$ or something). they said again that it won't arrive
until next week or so (next week i go). i choosed to let them ship the
muffler to me in bangkok (another 170$). that mean 240+170=410$, that more
expensive than my aluminize muffler too................ 
i don't know who's wrong, i orderd it a month ago to have enough time to get
it.????????? 

anyway solong for just 3 months and take care, 
Jap
911SC 78' turbolook
318i 95'
and soon another PORSCHE (944turS or 911) in US
