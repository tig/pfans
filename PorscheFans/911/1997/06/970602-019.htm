Mike Lee - Team Banana Racing, writes to ask about three Allen bolts he
sees holding his exhaust on.  I forget his year of engine/style of exhaust,
but the heat exchangers on the valued '74 exhausts (and also on various
other heat exchanger styles, I believe) have three mysterious holes in
them which line up nicely (or are supposed to) with three of the exhaust
studs.  These studs are (in theory) the hardest to reach with a wrench. 
So factory used barrel nuts (tall round nuts with an in-hex in one end) as
they did for head nuts and three per side can housing nuts.  To take
advantage of these you need a looooong Allen socket, which you insert
through the holes to loosen these nuts.  For installation, you can insert
tool, reach around heat exchanger and get nut to sit on top of tool, push
tool up to stud, and tighten.  So that's my bet on what his Allen bolts are: 
nuts.  Of course, if they are rusted on more firmly than the studs are held
into the heads, they will work just like bolts, same as with rusted on
regular hexagonal nuts.  I kind of like this barrel nut system, although it
doesn't work as well if your studs are too long for your exhaust flanges,
as now you have to pile some washers up in there to account for this
(long stud pushes out end of barrel nut after nut is screwed on more
than 2/3ds or so of barrel nut length, preventing engagement of tool), and
since you can't reach those places conveniently to begin with, you can't
put washers on easily either, resorting to using grease as glue on
fingers and whatnot.  But I digress.

My $.02 is that studs which stayed put, assuming they don't look eroded
where the flanges are, ought to work fine and should be left alone.

Anyone who claims to be Team Banana is sure somehow to have been
a bad boy, but with all respect for the ever helpful Bob Spindel (a fellow
spirit, I see, in the maddening 4-arm engine stand puzzles which
eventually drove me into the welcoming arms of the factory engine stand
suppliers), but I don't think letting his engine sit on its heat exchangers
will lead to a lower circle in Hell.  (I assumed that when Mike asked about
supporting the engine by the cylinders he didn't really intend to make
something which reached up between the return tubes and took the
weight on the fins, but meant by the heads or exhaust attached to
heads).   I think that a very large number of people of varying degrees of
knowledge, skill, and care who have worked on or stored 911 engines
over the years have just rested or stored these engines on the
exhaust/heat exchanger system, or with blocks under the cam housing
edge of the heads if exhaust had been removed and a more stable or
higher (so jack will insert underneath) storage is needed, with no ill
effect.  Just because it is stable and convenient and every ignoramus
does it doesn't mean it is right, but I've never heard of the dreaded "bent
from improper storage cylinder disease" or some similar malady
attributable to improper engine storage in this regard.  My intuition, for
what little it is worth, tells me that those 3 (per side) fairly short cylinders
strongly clamped with twelve thick studs are plenty strong enough to
hold up the center of the engine without anything warping, even subtly
and insidiously.  They are nice strong tube shapes, reinforced as to
crushing with fins even, and held in fairly close fitting (and well clamped)
circular spigots at each end.  The whole engine is held on with just 4
slightly larger bolts in tension.  The headers/heat exchangers themselves
are obviously stronger if the muffler system is still attached and
contributing.  But even headers unsupported by anything will not
collapse under the weight (mine haven't anyway) until some other blocks
or props can be inserted to ease the strain.  All is not lost when the
engine slides unintentionally off the jack while close to the ground  and
rests on whatever is available (just think like an Egyptian if you don't
have some sort of hoist).  

The factory had a nice plate to attach to your jack to keep engine more
stable while wheeling it in and out (on my wish list after years of faking
it)).  But I've never seen P/N P2004 engine cradle listed, complete with
admonition not to use cruder methods.

So mark me as bad too on this one.
