Interesting I don't recall a car ever sending me email before.  At any   
rate I don't know beans about fuel calibration on your electronic fuel   
injection but I had a pressure check done to mine as part of   
troubleshooting my CIS.  Cost was 1 hr labor plus about a buck for fuel   
seals.  On valve adjustment your labor rate would vary with what had to   
be taken out of the way but I just did mine on a 75 without AC and it   
took me 1hr to adjust the valves and about another 1hr to take the rocker   
covers off and replace them including cleaning the gasket surface.  This   
also included an oil change.  Note that I don't have a lift but do have   
the car up on ramps.
