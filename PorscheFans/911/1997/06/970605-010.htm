I compared my normal 993 with a Motor Sound equipped version. There 
are three differences that I can see:

    The entry into the air box has a crome surround instead of black 
plastic. The airbox itself is identical and does not flow any more 
air than the normal one.

    The exhaust pipes are shiny chrome instead of satin finish.
    
    The mufflers are modified and have a louder and raspier sound 
than stock.

You can get the same sound by getting a decent welder to cut open the 
muffler canisters and remove the huge amount of packing material 
inside. I had a brace welded in to prevent oil-canning. The factory 
muffler has only one baffles and is to my surprise quite 
unrestricted. I did this mod and the sound is almost like stock at 
normal cruising revs. When you put your foot in it or at highe revs 
on the track the engine sounds a lot like a mid 70's car with 
headers. Not too loud but a decided rasp. Cost me 75 bucks for the 
job.

A K and N air filter in a 993 will do absolutely nothing measurable 
for performance.  I tried one and my stop watch says "nada".  They do 
have the advantage of being reusable but you have to oil them 
correctly. Until someones shows me dyno info, I rate the K and N as a 
well made device which saves money in the long run.

In general terms I am always very wary of claims that a certain air 
filter will increase performance measurably. If the factory could add 
12 HP to a 993 engine for the price of an air filter, they would have 
done it. 

Secondly any filter which has the same surface area as another and 
which claims to flow more air must be less restrictive. It must also 
let more dust through it, how else could it flow better? As far as I 
know, engineers are subject to the laws of physics, whereas ad 
agencies are not. Caveat emptor! 

If the K and N guys are reading this, I'd be happy if they'd 
come out with a reusable pollen filter! The 993 has two of them and 
I just paid about 90 US dollars to replace them as part of a routine 
service!
