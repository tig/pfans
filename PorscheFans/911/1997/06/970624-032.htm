Presuming that this is a STOCK 74 911, with the original CIS
injection, you have all the symptoms of a failing warmup regulator
or voltage TO the warmup regulator.   THe WUR is supposed to
give you a richer mixture when the engine is cold.   If it fails to do
this, you get results like you have seen.   

The "choke" you mention is actually a hand throttle.   All later 
CIS models had an auxiliary air valve to automatically give you
a fast idle during startup.   

Fix:   Verify voltage to the WUR.   If it is present, change theWUR.   If
it is not present, find out why not.

Good luck.

Dave
