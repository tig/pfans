I was  one of those hi-milage (215k) 3.0 sc with no updates. After reading
all the posts, and Bruce Anderson's warnings, I was content to continue
driving  with  a  'don't fix it unless it's broke' attitude. Then last week
driving home on SoCals friendly fwys, THE NOISE STARTED. just a little at
first, then with every mile getting louder. Finally home, pulling into the
driveway, attracting attention of  the neighbors, got it into the garage.
Called the local maintenence boys, and explained what happened. Had it flat
bedded in (four days later)  complements of AAA, with instructions to NOT
START IT. 
 Received a call to come on in and take a look at it. When I arrived  the
mechanic started it up and it sounded normal. I know what I heard, and told
him to go ahead and take it for a spin. He din't want to take a chance. 


Not wanting to have the tensioner colapse again, jump time and ruin a lot
of things, we decided to go ahead and  install the carrera tensioners  When
he opened it up and inspected there was no sign of anything collasped. 
 I feel that I got a warning, and waited long enough. Now it sounds like a
carrera, runs like a SC, and I feel a lot better.
BTW I still have not had to replace the original clutch(ruber centered)
that is. Stay tuned for the 'next ordeal'
