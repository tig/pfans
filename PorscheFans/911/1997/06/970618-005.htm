Pholks,

I am about to remove my factory heat exchangers and put
headers on my car.  Couple of questions:  what kind of tool
can I use to access the hex nuts on the driver's side heat
exchanger?  Also, my car is a '76 with an auxiliary oil cooler
up front.  I am confused about what oil lines I actually need.
I called PartsHeaven with the part number I thought I needed
(930.107.729.10), but they said that I don't need that one -
that I actually need a 911.107.739.10 (which I bought).  It
does appear that need the .739. line, but I also seem to think
that I still need the .729. line also.  (the .739. line is the hard
line that attaches to the engine and comes underneath to
the passenger's side - the .729. line should connect to this
and go to the thermostat).

Any help would be appreciated (BTW, so far I haven't broken
any studs...got my fingers crossed).
