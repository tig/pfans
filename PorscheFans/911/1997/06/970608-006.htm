Forgive me for eating bandwith with a repetitive question.
I know in my months of viewing the list, multiple people, multiple times
have posted symptoms similar to mine. Rather than spending days
reviewing the archives or finding an upfixin manual, I thought I
would take the "easy" route...  Please bear with...

84 Carrera 3.2 Stock, 80K, complete top-end rebuild 11K ago...

Problem:  The car has begun stalling whenever I lift off
off the accelerator.  It had occured intermittently while driving, 
and when just puttering around (backing out of a garage, for example).
It doesn't spit and sputter, it just dies instantly.  Hit the key
and it starts right back up.  It had done this occasionally for
the last 3 months of driving, just often enough to raise curiosity, but
not concern.  Two nights ago, after driving for a while at full 
temperature, it stalled 4 or 5 times in a row while I was putting 
it away in the garage.  The next morning, it continued to exhibit the 
same behavior cold when I was taking it out of the garage.  Again,
the problem was the same, whenever you have the throttle at any position
above idle and let it drop to idle by lifting off the accelerator, 
it just dies.

In addition, when it was started the following morning cold, 
the idle would bounce between 500 and 1500 in a one or two-second cycle,
as I have heard described many times on the list.  

I am assuming it is a sensor of some sort.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks, in advance,
