It is the holes in the cover not the filter that is producing that
sound. I drilled holes in the cover of my air box and continued to use
the stock air filter. The howl it made was quite surprising at first.

I have since replaced the entire air box with a K&N cone filter. This
setup supposedly gives a higher air flow rate but it is not anywhere
near as noisy as the holey air box.

Besides, you wouldn't want to do anything that would detract from the
great sound of that Monty muffler! (Assuming yours sounds as good as
mine.)
