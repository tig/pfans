<pre>
The radio in my new (used) 911 has had terrible reception. While digging
around under the dash I found that the lead from the built in wire in the
wind sheild had been cut and a regular antenna that should have been mounted
on the fender was connected in it's place. The reception was lously because
the antenna was stuffed up under the dash.

My questions are: 1) Is it worth it to hook up the original built in antenna?
2) Would a continiuty test tell if the built in antenna is good? 3) Is it
better to go with a fender mounted antenna?

Thanks
Jack, 911 Cab.
