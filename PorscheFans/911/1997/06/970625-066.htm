I know there's a few attorneys, retired officers (judges?) out there;
HELP!

My court date is 2 weeks away! Here is what I know so far:

NJ has taken judicial notice of k 55 radar (meaning that the court
presumes the technology to be generally accurate in detecting speed)-
and supposedly the police have a well worn patter that covers all of the
"it was properly calibrated, properly used, and yes-- the operator was
properly trained" issues.

If I'm found guilty of this 4 point ticket (67 in a 50mph zone)- it will
cost me about at least 2-3 thousand more over the next couple of years
(in NJ-- the city, state and insurance company all get a piece of you--
for up to 39 months!!)!!!! 

Are any of the following real defenses or points in my favor?

1. The Newark officer clocked me in Jersey City (Hudson County) (I'm
sure of this- I saw when and where he started to tail me after he zapped
me - and the officer admitted to me that I was not speeding after that
while he was tailing me) -- BUT he followed me for 3-4 miles until I
entered Newark (Essex County) before he pulled me over. A jurisdiction
defense?

2. Is there a 'speedy trial' motion to dismiss statute in NJ? The ticket
was given to me almost 1 year ago-- the court has pushed back the court
date several times now for their own reasons....

3. Can/will the prosecutor ( I assume there is a prosecutor in traffic
court..) allow me to plead guilty to a non-moving violation (no
points)if I agree to pay at least as much as the speeding ticket alone
would cost? (unfortunately for me - there is a statute that sez the
COURT cannot amend the charge to a different substansive offense- -- BUT
is that true of the prosecutor as well? 

4. I've been a good boy lately- haven't gotten a speeding ticket in 10
years (OK... 9 years and 10 months..) and currently have zero points on
my licence.

5. Is adjourning it to death an option- and should I do this? 

6. Can I show up and move to dismiss if the officer doesn't show-- or
does someone get to pinch-hit for him, or does he get 5 more times to
show up first..?

Anything else I should know about? 

--If anyone is practicing in Essex County- PLEASE contact me. 


Many TIA, Gregory from NJ-- (no-- not the one about to move to New
England)
'92 C2 cab (soon to be a VW if I can't do something here...)

And now-- a statement intended to put out some flames before they get
started:
PLEASE-- spare myself and the list noise about how we should simply bend
over and take it without a fight--- I say the state must first prove
every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt-- and I have the
right to defend myself!!!!!!
