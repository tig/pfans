I'm looking for information on performance driver schools held in the SF
area.  Does anyone out there have contacts, schedules, or information?  Here
in Michigan the most active groups are Porsche clubs (duh, of course) and
BMW clubs.  I'm looking for drivers schools that take folks from abject
beginners level.  What I'm looking to do is to give my brother a driver
school as a Christmas present!

Thanks in advance!!

          Bruce:

          I don't know if this fits your needs, but I run driving
          schools twice a year in Southern California under the
          auspices of the MIT Alumni Club of Southern California (it's
          a long story!).  Most of the participants are complete
          beginners, and I don't require any special safety equipment
          in people's cars, to encourage first timers to come out.
          The instructors are mostly Porsche Owners Club members and
          me, and people get at least 3 hours of track time, which is
          more than most people get in a whole time trial weekend.
          Cost is $225, and includes breakfast, lunch and drinks
          throughout the day.

          The next event is in May (maybe even the Monday of Memorial
          Day Weekend), and may even be at Buttonwillow, which is
          pretty close to 1/2 way between San Francisco and Los
          Angeles.  If it's not at Buttonwillow, it'll be at Willow
          Springs, which is still part way between SF and LA.  Let
          me know if this would work.

          P.S. - My last event was Sept. 16, and 4 people came down
          from the SF Bay area for the event.
