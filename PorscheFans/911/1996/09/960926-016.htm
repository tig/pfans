Ergonomics is also about efficiency & productivity. I think a 
911 is a wonderful example of efficiently getting from A to B :)

Re ergonomics, the 911 is not bad at all, and crash survival data
is very good too. Just ask VW why the women in some TV adverts have 
to a) virtually reach behind them to get to the handbrake (seat so 
far forward) and b) use both hands simultaneously to undo it.

The VW is certainly not perfect re Ergonomics.
Plus, bearings to ergonomics, I want to have some real fun :)
