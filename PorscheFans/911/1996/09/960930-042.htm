I vote that the we throw the next person that forwards this kind of diatribe
off of the list.  I get enough of this crap at work and it is just BUNK.  DON'T
FORWARD THIS CRAP AND PERPETUATE THE MESS UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING
THAT WE DON'T.

> >>This message is extremely important.  It is about a

> >>Thanks.
> >>
> >>SUBJECT: [Very Important  !!! ]
> >>
> >>There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet. If  you
> >>receive an email message with the subject line "Good  Times", DO NOT
> >>read  the message, DELETE it immediately.  Please read the messages
> >>below.

> >> Some miscreant is sending  email under the title "Good Times"

> >>     The FCC released a warning last Wednesday concerning a matter of
> >>major importance to any regular user  of the Internet. Apparently a new
> >>computer virus has been engineered by a user of AMERICA ON LINE that
> >>is unparalleled in its destructive capability. Other more well-known
> >>viruses such as "Stoned", "Airwolf" and "Michaelangelo" pale in
> >>comparison to the
> >>prospects of this newest creation by a warped mentality. What makes this
> >>virus so terrifying, said the FCC, is the fact that no program needs to be
> >>exchanged for a new computer to be infected. It can be spread through the
> >>existing email systems of the Internet.
> >>
> >>     Once a Computer is infected, one of  several things can  happen. If
> >>the computer contains a hard drive, that  will most likely be
> >>destroyed. If the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will
> >>be placed in
> >>an nth-complexity infinite binary loop -which can severely damage the
> >>processor  if left running that way too long.
> >>
> >>Unfortunately, most novice computer users will not realize what is
> >>happening until it is far too late. Luckily, there is one sure means
> >>of detecting what is now known as the "Good Times" virus. It always
> >>travels to new computers the same way in a text email message with the
> >>subject
> >>line reading "Good Times". Avoiding infection is easy once the file has
> >>been received simply by NOT READING IT! The act of loading the file into
> >>the mail server's ASCII buffer causes the "Good Times" mainline program to
> >>initialize and execute.
> >>
> >>     The program is highly intelligent- it will  send copies of itself
> >>to everyone whose email address is contained in a receive-mail file or
> >>a sent-mail file, if it can find one. It will then proceed to trash
> >>the computer it is running on.
> >>
> >>     The bottom line is:  - if you receive a file with the subject line
> >>"Good  Times", delete it  immediately! Do not read it"  Rest assured that
> >>whoever' name was on the  "From" line was surely struck by the virus. Warn
> >>your  friends and  local system users of this newest threat to the
> >>Internet! It could save them a lot of time and money.

> >>DO NOT DOWNLOAD this file under any circumstances!!! If you install
