Hi Thom-

I think you made a very wise decision.  The best way to learn is to 
take an engine apart and put it back together.  I got started in all this 
stuff by buying a cheap old TR3, and just dismantling it.  My wife 
had the right idea.   I was worried that I might not be able to get it all 
back together, but she said, "So what?  What if you don't?  You'll 
have spent a year getting greasy and enjoying yourself, and the 
entertainment value for you alone will have been worth the cost."  
She was absolutely right.  That was 2 240Z's and 2 911's ago.

As for the CV's.  They ought to be full of grease.  You can clean them 
with solvent, before putting in new grease.  I have been told to be 
careful if you remove any of the balls to put them back in the same 
location, since they wear selectively.  Dunno if that's true or not, but 
I've kept them in the same spot.  Also, when re-mounting the axle 
shafts, you might flip them so the inner CV goes on the outside and 
vice versa.  I'm told this can help balance the wear.  Again, who 
knows?  

The boots?  If they are in good shape and nice and pliable, I wouldn't 
replace them.  It's easy enough to do it if one splits.  It's not like 
taking an engine apart, which is such a big deal that once in there 
you replace anything that might be even only slightly worn.

Pack the joints full of grease.  If you want to know about CV joint 
greases, there was an almost infinitely long thread on P-fans not too 
long ago.  On the other hand, you can just go into your local 
autoparts store and buy a can of grease that's labelled for CV joint 
application.  Saves a lot of reading and fretting.

Regards,

Bob Spindel
