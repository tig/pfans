Jerry,
  Here's some addl. info.:  for US models, starting in '78, the SC had
flared rear fenders, so you could get wider than 205 without rolling fender
lips, and the more reliable 3.0SC engine.  

Depending on who you read, starting with '76 galvanization started, fully in
'77.  The '77 still had major engine reliability problems, but did have
divilar head studs in the exhaust side , and enhanced valve material, as
well as some minor changes in adding a brake booster, adjustable rear swing
arms to facilitate height adjustment.  

Unless your mid '70s engine has been upgraded and rebuilt with full records,
you may want to consider a good '78+ SC coupe for the engine reliability,
and the ability to put wider rubber in the rear.  The targa top can be noisy
and expensive, and has the most body flex of any 911 for the given year.
There are some good P-mechanics in the SV area, Heyer Performance in Mtn.
View, and Ken's Sportech in Campbell are a couple who can do pre-purchase
inspections.
