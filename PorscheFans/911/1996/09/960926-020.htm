George et all,

I've wondered the same thing.  But more as a way to trade up to
a lower mileage motor that will probably run cooler on the track.

If you want another 911, you're probably talking about an '85 or so
Carrera.  A little more muscle but a little heavier too.  Hard to say
if it'll be enough of a difference on the track.  The fastest G-stock
and F-stock 911's up here are within a second of each other at Brainerd.

If you really want some serious power you're in the ballpark of a 944
Turbo S.

After all these thoughts I'm leaning toward sticking with the SC and
putting the effort (and $$$) into the suspension and other upgrades.
I'd welcome any other thoughts along these lines.  The obvious downside 
is getting carried away and ending up with a seriously overpriced SC.

Regards,
