Bruce,

Thanks for the reply.  I took a closer look at the clutch and pressure
plate assembly that came with the flywheel; the seller threw them in as
he had no real need for them.
The pressure plate (Sachs#022 141 025D)doesn't appear to have ever
had any copper plating on it; it looks to be plain steel.  It does
appear to be in good shape.
The clutch disc (Sachs#1861 222 001) looks a bit worn.  Measuring depth
to the heads of the rivets, I get .035" of material on one side, and
..065" of material on the other side.
The copper surface on the flywheel is .038" thick; the surface looks fine.
I could not find those part #'s in any of my catalogs, so I can not
tell if they are correct for use with the flywheel; it doesn't sound
like they are.
Will these parts work together, or must I find that specific clutch?  WHat
side effects are there from using this clutch (apparently this clutch was
what was with the flywheel when it was disassembled)?  Why did Porsche
use a copper surface (increased "grab"?)?  Is the flywheel toast when the
plating wears out?  Copper doesn't seem too tough to me, and .04" is kinda
thin; I'd rather not be back in here in another 6 months....

Thanks for your advice,
Mike
