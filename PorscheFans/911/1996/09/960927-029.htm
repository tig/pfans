I'll second the recommendation for Earl's lines and fittings.
There doesn't appear to be any difference in quality or strength
but my experience is that Aeroquip is about 2x the cost of Earls.

Either one is available from the mail order speed shops (Racer
Wholesale carries one, Pegasus carries the other).  The Racers
Group definately sells Earls -- I bought a radiator (oil), lines
and P-car hard-line to 12 AN adapter from them.  Also check your
local speed shops as they usually stock one brand or another.
 
As for the line sizes, I /think/ 12 AN is a good match for the
hard lines.  Someone please correct me if this is wrong!  The
hard line adapters are available from Automotion or Performance
too.

One last suggestion: build the lines yourself.  It's not hard if
you follow the directions and lubricate everything really well.
