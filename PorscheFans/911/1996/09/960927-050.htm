Ok, so I'll admit I am blinded by love.  When I was a kid my dad drove
a 1967 911S (which he bought after selling his 356A, which replaced a
Jaguar XK120 which replaced an MG TD, all of which were raced when the
SCCA was new).  I still remember the day when that couple drove up in a
red 356 and took the 911 away.  So, to me the car I longed for was a
pre-74 911, which I bought 8 years ago with just 40,000 miles on the
clock, with its original factory paint, that had actually been stored in
a Sacramento barn for 10 years.  40,000 miles later, with no mechanical
problems whatsoever, I cannot be separated from this car.

Which brings me to my question.  My car is a "911".  The Porsches I always
coveted were "911"s.  Now we are talking about 993's.  Sure I have caught
some of the non-911 variants over the years (924, 928, 944, 968), and
heard about some of the race car numbers in between.  But, what are the
numbers associated with production 911s over the years?  And, lastly
(hopefully I won't get booted off of the list for this ignorance) what is
a 951 which seems to be held in such high regard?

If the best answer is go buy Bruce's book, that's fine, because I plan to
do so anyway.
