Hi, 
In the fall of 1993 Porsche introduced the 993 "The New 911 Carrera", which
was sold in Europe and the rest of the world as the 1994 model. For the US
market, Porsche introduced the 1994 C4 "Turbolook" Coupe as a 1994 model,
which they called the C4 Coupe. They also sold the Speedster the RS America
and the 911 Turbo 3.6, the C2 Coupe, Targa and Cabriolet as they had been for
the 1993 model year, but now these were also called 1994 models. 

The "New 911 Carrera", the 993 was introduced in the spring of 1994 as a 1995
model for the US market. The 993 hand been a 1994 model in Europe introduced
in the fall of 1993. The Cabriolet was introduced in March of 1994 as a 1994
model for Europe and a 1995 model for the US. 

The new 993 based Carrera was introduced in September of 1993 as having 30%
new technology for the same or a lower price depending upon where it was
sold. In the US the 993 was actually priced lower than the C2 coupe that it
replaced. The C2 coupe had sold for $64,990 and the 993 sold for $59,900 in
1994. The 993 seemed to be more than just 30% new, it was a real step forward
from the old 911. The 964, when it was introduced, was billed as 85% new
parts and although it was a radical departure from the old 911 it just looked
like a warmed over 911, and it was considered by most to be an evolutionary
step. Well if the 964 was an evolutionary step the 993 is two further
evolutionary steps. The new body style updated all of the old hallmarks of
the 911 into a bright new looking car. The new bodywork creates the most
significant appearance change in the history of the 911 while retaining the
911's classic identity. The 993 Retained the pop up rear spoiler which not
only improved the cars aerodynamics, but also enhanced the engine cooling
when it was up. The original prototypes were shown with the third stop light
integral with the rear roof molding at the top of the rear window. When the
993 show up on our shores instead of this integral stop light they had a
silly looking picnic basket handle mounted on the engine lid with the light
built in. It wasn't until the Turbo was introduced that the integral stop
light showed up on the US production cars. The 1996 Carrera coupe shared this
much more attractive integral stop light with the Turbo. 

In January of 1995 Porsche introduced the Carrera RS and RS Clubsport for the
European market only. The Euro RS and Clubsport had 300 hp 3.8 liter engines.
The bodywork was much more aggressive than the standard 993 body work with
aggressive front spoilers and a larger fixed rear wing. The Clubsport version
had an even more aggressive front spoiler and a larger double deck rear wing
with side plates. 

The Carrera RS and Clubsport wheels were the modular RS-Cup Design wheels 8 x
18" with 225/40 ZR 18" tires in the front and 10 x 18 with 265/35 ZR 18"
tires in the rear. Another nice new feature of these cars was a nice three
spoke Porsche Design Momo steering wheel .

The 911 Turbo C4 was introduced at the Geneva Auto show in March 1995. The
911 Turbo C4 was based on the 993 platform and had a contemporary version of
the venerable 911 Turbo engine with twin turbos and Motronic engine
management.
