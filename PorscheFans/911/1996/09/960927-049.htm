   "DisneyPors" commented about Seinfeld possibly owning a 959.  I thought 
I would convey my lucky day a couple of weeks ago while at the Santa 
Monica Airport in California.  I was watching the planes take off and land 
with my 2 year old daughter when across the runway we saw someone open a 
hanger containing not a single airplane, but all sorts of glittering 
cars.  We jumped into my 911 and raced around the airport to discover 
David Letterman's private auto collection.  The "curator", if you will, 
told us that Jerry Seinfeld keeps his collection of mostly Porsches in a 
hanger at the west end of the same airport, Charlie Sheen keeps his 
collection of mostly American muscle there too, and Jay Leno keeps his 
collection (which includes a rare Bugatti and numerous motorcycles) at the 
Burbank airport.

As to Letterman's collection, this is what I saw, all in immaculate (two 
feet test) condition:

Two Speedsters, one of them a Carrera.
Two Convertible D's
Two 356B Coupes (there may have been a C too)
914-6
911 Carrera (the car he drives the most)
Austin Healey Bug-eye Sprite
Austin Healey 100-4
Austin Healey 3000
Austin Healey (somewhere between a 100-4 and 3000)
MGA Twin Cam
Jaguar XKE 140
GMC Truck
Fiero GT 6 (his around NYC car)
Sunbeam Alpine (1953)
BMW late '70s 6 series


So what does this all mean?  I need to figure out how to make more money!
