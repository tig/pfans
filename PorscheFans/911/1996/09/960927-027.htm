Could you give us a short desciption of this procedure?  I believe Bruce
called it the "electronic displaced metal" process?????


EDM is electrical discharge machining. An electrode is very slowly fed into
the work (in this case the stud) and a spark discharge eats away tiny bits of
metal. A fluid washes away the bits. When I was at Bosch, we used this method
to drill tiny holes in hardened steel diesel fuel injector nozzles, holes
only a couple of thousandths in diameter, about a quarter inch long and dead
straight. Can't do that with any other method I know of. 

Because its action is so precise, the shop can set up the electrode to just
eat away the core of the stud, leaving the threads in place as a long helix
of metal. Without the solid center to support the thread, it pulls out --
just like, well, a thread. 

Those of you who are interested in this might be able to find back issues of
Home Shop Machinist from last year (series started in May/June issue), where
they published plans for making your own EDM set. I still wouldn't trust a
homebrew for doing something as valuable as a 911 case, but those articles
will give you the general idea. 

To find a shop that does EDM, look in phone book under "Taps-Extractingl"
(honest, that's where it is in my Business/Commercial books) or ask a machine
shop who fixes their mistakes. To give you some idea of how few such shops
there are, there are 5 in the Los Angeles book, 3 in Orange County.
