Having driven Fuchs and other alloy wheels in the winter, I would strongly
suggest that you put away both the BBS and the Fuchs wheels. Road salt
(Wisconsin still uses salt, right?) is absolute murder on aluminum. It eats
small black pits into the surface and it can't be fixed easily. My
recommendation is to find four steel wheels used for spare tires in 911 and
944 from one of the Porsche wrecking yards. You don't need the alloy look and
you don't need the alloy width to run something narrow like a winter tire. I
find these wheels for about $20-25 each at swap meets but since you need it
right now, figure that the junk yards will want more. See their ads in Pano,
for example. Aase Bros, European Auto Salvage, Best Deal, all those outfits.
