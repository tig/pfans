As to Letterman's collection, this is what I saw, all in immaculate (two 
feet test) condition:

Two Speedsters, one of them a Carrera.
Two Convertible D's
Two 356B Coupes (there may have been a C too)
914-6
911 Carrera (the car he drives the most)
Austin Healey Bug-eye Sprite
Austin Healey 100-4
Austin Healey 3000
Austin Healey (somewhere between a 100-4 and 3000)
MGA Twin Cam
Jaguar XKE 140
GMC Truck
Fiero GT 6 (his around NYC car)
Sunbeam Alpine (1953)
BMW late '70s 6 series


So what does this all mean?  I need to figure out how to make more money!
          _______________________________
          Given the amount of money Letterman makes and his penchant
          for Ferraris, this list is surprising, if it's his whole
          collection.  My guess is he's got some cars elsewhere.
          Also, query: why would Letterman have his car collection at
          Santa Monica Airport when he's in New York?  Climate?  He
          could certainly afford a temperature controlled environment.

          Re what it all means, I figured out long ago, as have many
          people, that I need to figure out how to make more money.
          Even the guys with brank spanking new 993's would like to
          make more money, so they could have brand spanking new 993
          Twin Turbos!
