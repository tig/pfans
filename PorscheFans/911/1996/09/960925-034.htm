Uhh...  Isn't that what it is?  I always thought it was more for engine
cooling than for aerodynamics.  Am I wrong about that?

          ___________________________
          The tail may provide some engine cooling capacity, but by
          far its primary function is aerodynamics.  I found this out
          when I first took by former '85 Carrera on the track in 1986
          when I started racing.  The back end of the car was wild,
          and wouldn't stay stuck at what I now realize are relatively
          low speeds at Willow (and the then functioning Riverside
          Raceway).  After 2 events, and having made a decision to
          actively pursue time trialling in the POC, my first purchase
          was a tail, which made a tremendous difference in handling,
          adding a lot of downforce to the rear end of the car.  In
          fact, it's my understanding that the downforce effect
          provided by the tail comes into play at speeds as low as 50
          mph.  It's not really surprising, when you think about it,
          since the shape of the rear end of a 911 is completely
          contrary to the ideal aerodynamic model - low in the front
          and high in the back.  Without the tail, the rear end of the
          911 drops downward, providing essentially no downforce.
