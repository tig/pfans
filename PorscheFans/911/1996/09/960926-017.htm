Porsche Pins Its Hopes       On The Boxster{
  By Brandon Mitchener
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

  BERGISCH-GLADBACH, Germany -- Porsche AG, the German sports car maker,
just
started production of its first all-new car in 18 years, the two-seater
Boxster.

  Porsche is the third German auto maker to introduce an open roadster
this
year, after Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) AG's Z3 and Mercedes-Benz's
SLK.

  But while the other cars are considered niche models for their
manufacturers, the Boxster is crucial to Porsche's long-term
performance.
Porsche's only other current model, the 911, is expected to undergo a
major
overhaul in about a year, and the company is still struggling to stay
profitable after a brush with bankruptcy in the early 1990s. It has laid
off
workers and cut the production time of the 911 almost in half, to 70
hours.

  Although analysts said the company appears to be back on track, and
sales
of
the 911 are near record levels, Porsche management decided that a
continued
dependence on one model was too risky.

  "Our biggest challenge is to establish new groups of purchasers with
new
products," Porsche Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking told reporters at the
car's
launch near Cologne. "We don't want to be a bigger fish in a pond
constantly
becoming smaller, but rather a growing fish with more room to move in a
larger
pond -- maybe even a lake."

  With prices starting around 76,100 marks ($50,667), the Boxster is
about
half as expensive as the 911 and enlarges Porsche's target market to
more
than
500,000 potential buyers world-wide, from about 60,000.

  "In a market that big, we're confident we'll be able to sell our
15,000
cars
and make a profit," said Horst Marchart, the Porsche board member
responsible
for research and development.

  In the U.S., where Porsche hopes to sell a third of its Boxster
output,
prices will start at $39,900. Porsche dealers are getting their first
look
at
the car at a presentation in Scottsdale, Ariz., and customers should
start
to
see it in showrooms next February or March, said Michael Schimpke, a
Porsche
spokesman.

  "We think the Boxster will have the same success as our other cars in
other
markets, and expect to sell around onethird in the U.S., one third in
Germany
and one-third of our production in the rest of the world," he said.

  The company is also considering an alliance with Mercedes-Benz to sell
a
higher-specification version of Mercedes's U.S.-built all-activity
vehicle
under the Porsche brand name.

  For now, it is concentrating on selling the Boxster. The first year's
production is reportedly already sold out, and Porsche said it is
confident
it
will sell 15,000 a year thereafter. Production of the 911 is also
expected
to
hover around 15,000 in the fiscal year ending next July 31. BMW, by
contrast,
plans an annual production of 35,000 Z3s and Mercedes around 40,000 SLKs
in
the 1997 calendar year.

  The biggest difference between the three cars is the price. The BMW
starts
for around 44,500 marks and the SLK for 52,000 marks.

  The Boxster has trunks in both the front and rear because the all-new,
six-cylinder engine is mounted in the middle.

  The Boxster, unlike the 911, is targeted at a younger clientele -- 35
years
old on average -- including a greater percentage of women. Unlike the
911,
which on average shares garage space with a household's 1.9 other cars,
the
Boxster will often be a household's only car. Fewer than 10% of
Porsche's
current customers are women, a figure the company expects to rise to
15%-20%
with the arrival of the Boxster.

  Investors, meanwhile, are counting on an overall boom in roadster
sales
--
Mercedes just announced an increase in production, and BMW has sold
35,000
already this year -- to propel Porsche toward greater profitability.
