GOOD GRIEF, NO!!! The correct answer is none of the above. I know Autofarm
has a reputation in Britain but that must be because the locals are
accustomed to British cars and anything that works as well as a real car is
the next best thing to voodoo. Their solutions are INCREDIBLY STUPID. NEVER
attack a hard steel bolt in a soft aluminum part, especially one as easy to
screw up and expensive to replace as a crankcase, with drills. 

Note the wording: >using progressively bigger drill bits you may be able to
get up 
>to M7.
"May be". But maybe not. Do you feel lucky?

If heating (GENTLY!!! Do you know how easily aluminum melts?) and grabbing
the part still sticking out doesn't do it, as Bruce Anderson suggested, take
it to an EDM shop, again as Bruce Anderson suggested. I asked Bruce to be on
this list because of exactly this sort of thing, there's too much BS out
there and he is one of the few people with the background and reputation to
cut through it. For about $25 the EDM shop will take it out without even
touching the threaded walls of the hole. Running a tap through there is
terminally dumb too. What class of fit is your tap? What class of fit does
the factory call for to keep that stud from loosening under heat cycling? 

As for "the stupid designer," do you suppose there is a reason they did it
that way? In an ordinary straight-shank bolt, where is the stress
concentration? How do you reduce that? For answer, look at a torsion bar. Or
"Engineer to Win" by Carroll Smith, p. 120 and especially p.122. Or some
unique high-stress mil spec aircraft bolts that, oddly enough, look just like
those stupid bolts designed by those stupid Germans. Or even some stupid
Englishmen (see Cosworth rod bolt, Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts and Fasteners
Handbook, p. 42.) For that matter, look through the Nuts, Bolts etc. book and
you'll see the necked-down shank design used time and again. See, isn't this
a great list, we not only apply the Socratic method, we tell you where to
find the answers, too. But you have to look them up yourself to learn
anything.
