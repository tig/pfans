I refinished mine a couple of months ago following the instructions of
Larry Reynolds of Car Care Specialties. I'm quite happy with the result,
and Larry has most of the supplies. Maybe I'm a paint fiend, but I had to
buy one more can of Wurth black than Larry recommended.

The most difficult thing I had to deal with was figuring out just how heavy
a coat to apply. Very light coats had a noticeably rough texture; heavier
ones were smooth and shiny with a slight orange peel quality; just a little
more and it would run.

I used a thin blue plastic masking tape from 3M which was quite easy to
work with and came off very easily with the use of a hair dryer.

This was my first painting project and while I know I'll be able to do it
faster and better next time, I'm more than happy with the appearance.

Good luck!

Here's Larry's article:

---

1. The actual match for the OEM Fuchs Alloy black is the Wurth Gloss Black
Wheel Paint, and the match for the clear coat is Wurth Gloss Clear.  If you
are repainting all four wheels this is probably the best combo to use.  The
paints are specifically formulated to withstand the high temperature
environment of wheels.

2. If you are repainting only one or two wheels and if the black on the
existing wheels has faded, then Wurth Matt Black with clear coat may match.
 Try using 3M Imperial Hand Glaze on the faded wheels, you may be surprised
to find out how much you can improve their appearance. If 3M alone does not
quite do the trick, try adding a little Blue Magic to the 3M and polish out
the existing paint.

3. A trick for masking wheels or other compound curves, is to use the thin 3M
self adhesive masking (not scotch) tape to define the line.  The thin paper
will deform relatively easily and require less trimming with a razor blade.
 Once you have the tape in place, warm (not heat)  it with a hair dryer as
you press it down.  Try overlaying the tape with another layer of tape to
make removal easier.  Leave a 1/64 " gap between the two layers of masking
tape.  Make sure that the edge of the tape that defines the paint line is
firmly in contact with the wheel. Take your time in this phase.  Cover the
rest of the wheel with paper, including the outside and inside.  Paint will
get into everyting so mask carefully.  An hour spent at this stage will pay
big dividends.  One of the tricks to spray painting is to start the spray off
of the area to be painted.  When first starting a spray of paint, there will
be spatters that will mar your work.  Start off the work surface and move the
spray onto the work and in one smooth motion, sweep across the surface and
past.  Move down for the next path (still keeping the spray going) and move
back onto the work, continue across moving in a smooth motion till you are
off the work on the other side.  Move down and continue the off - on -off
-down off - on -off motions.  Maintain the spray at a 90 degree angle to the
surface to be painted.  Don't tilt the spray can or gun.

4. The key to a good looking finish on a wheel or any painting project is
preparation.  You should spend 90% of your time in prep and 10% of your time
painting.  Many people reverse the percentages and wind up with dismal
results.   If the existing black paint is in good condition, other than faded
and the polished/clear coated areas are in excellent shape,  you may get away
with only repainting the black areas.  Slightly rough up the painted area
 with a 1200 grit sandpaper.  Clean down with an organic solvent such as
Wurth Citrus Degreaser and then mask.  You are ready to paint, see #6.

5. If the wheels have areas that are chipped through the clear coat/black
coat or the polished areas are cloudy or discolored, then you may want to
consider removing all the existing paint.  The best way I have found to
remove the existing paint is plastic media  blasting.  This will remove all
of the paint and leave the surface ready for polishing.  Polish the wheels
using a cloth wheel or you may be able to hand polish them.  Clean them down
thoroughly with an organic solvent such as Wurth Citrus Degreaser and mask.

6. Hang the wheels with a washer that is just slightly larger than the
diameter of the stud hole (large enough to not fit through the hole but small
enough to fit deep into the stud depression.  Run a wire around the washer
and place in the stud depression.  Hang the wheel at chest level.  Try to do
all four wheels at the same time.  Clean just prior to painting with a Prep
Sol type of cleaner.  Spray a coat of quality primer such as Wurth Rustop
Primer on the areas to be painted (NOT the clear coated areas), allow to dry
and then paint the black areas with several light coats.  This is important,
as the Wurth Paints don't like to be applied in one or two heavy coats.  They
will give the best results with numerous (I apply 8+) thin coats.  Allow each
coat to dry about an hour before applying the next coat.  When the black is
finished and had dried for 48 hours, remove the tape.

7.  If you have not stripped off the existing clear coat from the polished
areas, then do NOT try to repolish these areas.  See #9.

8. Carefully hand re-polish any areas that need it.  If you use a machine,
you may mar the new paint.

9. Lightly sand the painted areas that are to be clear coated with 2000 grit
sand paper to slightly rough up the surface and allow the new paint better
adhere.   Do not sand non clear coated polished areas.  Clean all the areas
to be clear coated with a Prep Sol type of product and apply several light
coats of Wurth Clear Wheel Paint. Allow to dry for an hour between coats.

 If you have taken you time, you should be pleased with the results.

If anyone wants more information on the details of refinishing wheels, or
can't find the Wurth, 3M or Blue Magic Products locally, please give me a
shout.
