I'm having trouble getting the front wheel bearings on my 1979 911 adjusted
right.  I think part of the problem might be over-zealous tech inspection.  At
my first tech inspection this year (done at an autocross, not in a shop), they
said my bearings were loose.  I checked play, and there did seem to be a lot.

This was my first encounter with the "move washer with screwdriver" spec for
tightness.  Based on the amount of play, I figured the washer under the nut on
the hub would be pretty loose.  Instead it was pretty snug, and hard to move.
Still, I tightened the bearings a bit more.  I could still move the washer with
a screwdriver without prying, but I needed two hands.  This left the wheel with
some play, but much less than before.

Now I have again been told that my bearings are loose, this time during a tech
inspection at a reputable shop.  The wheels have some play, but only a little.
I can hear the wheel rocking as I move it.  This is only with the wheel
mounted.  I can't sense any movement if I try to rock the brake disc.

I think the bearings are tight enough, and I'm inclined to leave them alone.
Should I be able to detect slight movement of the wheel when I rock it?  Should
I be able to hear them rock, or is this a sign that they really are too loose?

Thanks in advance.
