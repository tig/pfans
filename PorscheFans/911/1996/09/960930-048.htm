          I can't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure this "Good Times"
          e-mail virus thing is a hoax.  The message that Ron Calef
          forwarded (not suggesting any impropriety on Ron's part)
          sounded as if it was recent, and I remember the same type of
          scare message going around the Internet about one or two
          years ago.   The same is true for the "PKZIP300" legend.  On
          the RX-7 net, there was quite a debate about it, some
          swearing from inside knowledge that it is a hoax, and one or
          two saying that it was for real.

          Why would anyone do this?  Think about the pleasure that
          some sick mind sitting in front of his/her computer would
          get out of spreading fear about any message titled "Good
          Times," and then sending out a whole bunch of them so
          titled.  In fact, I almost routinely changed the title of
          this post to something containing the words "Good Times"
          because the post is about that subject, and quickly realized
          that my message would never get read!
