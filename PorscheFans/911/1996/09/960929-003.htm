Greetings P-nuts,

Well, For some time now I have had this complete running gear package, out
of a '71T, for sale.  I received absolutely ZERO response.  So I guess it's
safe to assume these old 2.2ltr guys don't enjoy the same market as 3.2 ltr
Carrera motors!! :)
So I decided "ok fine" ...
So now what I thought I'd do is teach myself all the ins and outs of these
early engines and transaxles over the course of the winter.  My info
sources are/will be Bruce's handbook (the x-rated one) and my factory
manuals and whatever input comes from this great list...perhaps even
something from "The Bruce" himself on occasion?! :), (I know he's a busy
guy, but one can always hope...)

Having said all that...My first exercise concerns the CV joints/halfshaft
assemblies.  I have these guys off the transaxle and on the bench.  I was
told this running gear was very low mileage when I bought it. (I bought
very cheaply, so the stories that came with it really don't matter).  All
the"Visuals" seem to verify this low mileage claim, but what concerns me is
the actual condition of these joints:
- One boot (outer) is torn
- amount of grease present... there's not a whole lot in there, especially
on outer, wheel side(s)
- there was a yellow paint mark on the hub-end of the axle, covering the
tip and a tiny portion of the 30mm nut...does this mean we spent time in a
junkyard at one point?  This is the same side with the torn boot.

Questions are:
- how would I best clean the actual CVs? in order to repack them?
- I think I understand what wear signs to look for, ball surfaces etc, is
this right? are there any other wear areas?
- what would be the ideal grease to use for re-packing? Stuff thats in
there now appears to be a grey-graphite sort...almost looks like
"never-seize"
- how full should I pack?
- Other than the torn one, should I replace the rubber boots even if they
appear to be OK?
- How much torque is really needed on 30mm axle nuts? and can I re-use those?

I started with the CV/axles simply because I'm afraid the ones on my 914
are going to need attention pretty soon.  I figured this would serve as an
excellent lesson & practise session, before ripping into my daily driver.

Any thoughts on the above?
going over this engine and tranny over the winter is gonna be
fun...everybody's invited to get involved in this one!!  (The "P-Fan
Special")

Cheers
