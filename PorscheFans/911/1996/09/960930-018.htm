Mark,

If you needed two hands to move the washer after adjusting the bearings you 
are WAY to tight.  If at this tightness you still have play it doesn't 
sound like bearing adjustment is going to solve your problem.

I have to mount the wheel to feel any rocking movement in the bearings.  
Pulling and pushing on just the rotor only shows extremely lose bearings.  
I use the extra leverage from the tire to  fine tune the bearing 
adjustment.

I do not know what your problem is but I would recommend taking everything 
apart, cleaning and looking at the condition of the bearings, hub and the 
spindle.

Good luck,

Scott

I'm having trouble getting the front wheel bearings on my 1979 911 adjusted
right.  I think part of the problem might be over-zealous tech inspection.  
At
my first tech inspection this year (done at an autocross, not in a shop), 
they
said my bearings were loose.  I checked play, and there did seem to be a 
lot.

This was my first encounter with the "move washer with screwdriver" spec 
for
tightness.  Based on the amount of play, I figured the washer under the nut 
on
the hub would be pretty loose.  Instead it was pretty snug, and hard to 
move.
Still, I tightened the bearings a bit more.  I could still move the washer 
with
a screwdriver without prying, but I needed two hands.  This left the wheel 
with
some play, but much less than before.

Now I have again been told that my bearings are loose, this time during a 
tech
inspection at a reputable shop.  The wheels have some play, but only a 
little.
I can hear the wheel rocking as I move it.  This is only with the wheel
mounted.  I can't sense any movement if I try to rock the brake disc.

I think the bearings are tight enough, and I'm inclined to leave them 
alone.
Should I be able to detect slight movement of the wheel when I rock it?  
Should
I be able to hear them rock, or is this a sign that they really are too 
loose?

Thanks in advance.
