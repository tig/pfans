To add my $.02 
 
<Snip all of the orig mail message> 
 
The key is on the left because it provided an advantage 
when early racers...had to run..get in their cars and take off... 
they could start and have one hand on the gear shift at the same time. 
 
All of it was for a reason.....it was not just placed there  
to be diff. 
 
 
Black wiper blades....not a cool look....just that the chrome 
ones shined the light into the drivers eyes at night and blinded them 
so they painted them black..... 
 
We may have a common history with the VW but like man and ape... 
we are very far apart in our evolution. 
 
 
The door handle is right where is should be. no search is needed 
and the design does prevent things from getting hung on it. 
 
 
And lets face it....it is a matter of taste.....But, I could never understand 
why someone would prefer Rossie O'Donnal or Roseann Barr over say 
Pamela Anderson.....maybe all it takes it just a sense of humor.... 
 
NOT!!!!!! Is that not like comparing a VW to a Porsche... 
 
					I think I'm In the Long  
					Line Today, Pamela I'm Next 
				( And I'll Keep My 911 , Thank You very Much)
