I have new Bilsteins(non-adj) on my Cab.  They were on the car last year when 
I bought it.  Way too soft for my taste and non adjustable. Has a Cadillac 
ride with Lincoln handling. I have had Konis on every car I've owned and been 
happy with them.  If I keep this Cab any longer I'm going to put Koni Reds on 
it.  Bilstein makes a sport shock that's stiffer but I have no experience with 
it.

Marc-

I have an opinion, FWIW.  The entire P-crowd will
probably descend on me en masse for saying this, but
I like the KYB's that are in my '72 911.  The car feels
nice and stiff, and the ride firm.  I use it daily,
and for autoxing and a track day when I can.  I'm
not the most experienced competitive driver, and it's
possible that I'd do just as well with no shocks at
all, but at least for me the KYB's are fine.

I have brand new Bilsteins on my other '72 911, and
I think they are fine too.  Perhaps a bit softer, but
it could just be the difference between the two cars.

I guess the conclusion that I've come to is that at
least for me the very much cheaper KYB's are fine.
