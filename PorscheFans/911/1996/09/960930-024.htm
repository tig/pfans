     In shopping for a older 911 (pre '74) should you seriously steer away 
     from vehicles that do not pass emissions tests (say in CA)?  What is 
     the typical cost of getting one of these vehicles to pass (again, say 
     in CA)?  What engine problems might a failed test indicate (assuming 
     other tests, like compression, are acceptable).
     
     In college I did a fair amount of work on our hybrid electric vehicle. 
     We were able to get our little 20 hp Kohler engine to run extremely 
     clean by using two (in series) catalytic converters and injecting air 
     into the stream.  Is this "legal" for passing emissions tests?  How 
     about quick fixes/tricks to getting that certificate?  I'm sure, being 
     the innovative folks that most serious Porsche Fans are, you've got a 
     few!
