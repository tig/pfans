>Can anybody tell me the process they use to make forged wheels?

If you have the book "Porsche 911: Forever Young" by Aichele there is an
entire chapter in there. 

Basically, they start with a biscuit of aluminu, maybe 8" dia and 2" thick.
This gets squished into a thick pie-plate shape, then it gets squeezed even
thinner and bigger diameter when the holes and spokes are pressed in, then
the edge is squeezed down to form flanges, a sort of U-shape, which is then
drawn out to form any width you want. The neat thing about the process is
that you don't need new molds to make different offsets or widths, or maybe
even diameters (don't know), you just squeeze the flanges more or less. The
outside edge is turned on a lathe for appearance's sake. Then it was
polished, anodized, painted, whatever.
