Greetings

Prior to the P-rade,  a club race was held at the Hallet OK raceway as I'm
sure alot of you know.  Just hadn't heard much discussion on about it.  It
was my first to watch, in fact,  I work grid which was fun because I got to
see the cars up close and meet some great folks.

I thought I might hear Bruce A. comment something about the Dyno setup that
was there.  He like to hang out there alot. What an great setup.  It's was a
trailer mounted deal and for a modest sum of 20 bills, you could get three
runs on the dyno.  Racers, spectators and even a Volvo wagen took turns.
 Only problem was my friend had a  new 911 twin turbo (4wd) and they couldn't
figure out how to disable the front wheels so she couldn't do her car. 

Anyway - had fun,  hope to see another.  In fact,  Lone Star Region hopes to
hold one next year at Texas World Speedway prior to the San Antonio P-rade.
