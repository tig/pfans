Years ago, a professor of mine wrote a book on Algebraic Coding
Theory. He is a brilliant and precise guy, and he had been over the
book VERY carefully before it was published; he believed that very
few if any errors remained. He offered a dollar to the first finder
of any error. Turned out it cost him several hundred dollars, for
everything from fundamental flaws in theorems to an italicized
semicolon that shouldn't have been. You could make the same offer
with your book (I suppose it would have to be five dollars now) and
make more money selling it to PorscheFans hoping to catch you out
than it would cost in rewards - especially if you get the publisher
to make the offer instead of you. Then post the errata to someplace
accessible, like PorscheFans.
