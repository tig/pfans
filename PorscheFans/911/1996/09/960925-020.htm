Hi All,
Sorry for the bandwidth, but I couldn't pass this up. A friend
forwarded this to me from the VW GTI list, is this guy clueless or what?
  
>    From: emerson@eideti.com (Arthur Emerson)
>   To: gti-vr6@pebbs.com
>    Subject: Comparison: Porsche 911 vs. GTI VR6 :-)
>    Date: Sun, 22 Sep
> 
>    It's time for another installment of --- Arthur compares cars!
> 
>   Today's unbiased :-) comparison: The Porsche 911 Carerra vs. the GTI VR6.
>  This post is for those list members who have been saving for a used 911,
>    and compares the car you will likely be buying to your present car.
> 
>    Vehicle:   Porsche 911 Carerra
>    Year:      1995
>   Miles:     25K
>    Condition: Excellent, except many nicks, dings, and chips.
>               It did NOT age gracefully!
> 
>    My boss' 1995 BMW 325i was in for it's first scheduled service ($325!),
>    and this was the "loaner car." (What service!) This is not the dealer's
>    car; it belongs to his neighbor, who works for the dealer, and traded cars
>    for the day.  Needless to say, he wouldn't let me drive it, and only once
>    had it above 3000 RPM. The neighbor, OTOH, had the BMW sideways through
>    several turns on the way home, according to eyewitnesses.  Next time, I'll
>    con him into letting me take it to Lime Rock for a few hours! :-)
> 
>    Overall Impression:  Spartan.  There ain't no butt scratchers in this car.
>    Express windows?  You're lucky they're power. It feels exactly like what
>    it is - a hopped-up Beetle.  The design is dated, although many would
>    argue that it's well refined.
> 
>    Utility: You're buying this car for one of two reasons.  1) To drive
>    ludicrously fast.  2) To park outside of a motel while you "take care of
>    business."  You can drive it ludicrously fast to the motel, but don't plan
>    to skip getting a room.  The rear seats are a joke.
> 
>    Ergonomics:  The 911 designers can't spell the word!  The interior door
>    release handle is molded into the lower part of the armrest, conveniently
>    located below the seat side.  I had to move my leg to find it.  The only
>    reason I could think of for putting it there would be to prevent
>    accidental opening on the road.  I would be more worried about my pants
>    getting hooked and pulling it. There was more headroom than in my GTI in
>    the front seats.  Common controls, like the sunroof switch, are located in
>    front of the shifter on the center console.  Obviously, the original
>    design didn't have these features.
> 
>    Feel of construction: No doubt it's heavier than the GTI VR6.  The doors
>    close with authority, just like the BMW.  The GTI doors, well, mushy.  The
>    power window and other switches have a very solid feel, and the sunroof
>    motor makes enough noise to make me wonder if it was once used to turn a
>    tank turret.
> 
>    Instrument cluster:  Very well equipped with analog gauges.  The cluster
>    itself is not recessed or curved, making it look more like an airplane
>    than a car.  Like an airplane, there's a plethora of gauges to make sure
>    that the aircooled engine doesn't toast.  There's a strange little rocker
>   switch with a clock logo on it next to the analog clock.  I never did
>   figure out what that did!  The climate control thermostat was marked in
>    degrees celcius.  What a shame it didn't have a -40 setting. :-)  There
>    was a switch in the center console to open the retractable engine vent. I
>    hope it's OK to drive around town with it open, because there was no
>    documentation in the car.  One note, the ignition key was on the
>    dashboard, to the left of the steering wheel.  It was very difficult to
>    work for a right-handed person.  This particular one was damaged, and
>    required fiddling with the screwdriver, er, I mean key to get it to turn.
>    Once the key was on, the doors locked themselves automatically.
> 
>    Ease of service:  Have the dealer pick it up for service at the motel. :-)
> 
>    Seat belt ease of use:-)  The seat belts were very far back when retracted,
>    requiring major contorsion to grab them.  I like the GTI setup much better.
> 
>    Automatic transmission:-)  None here, but the six speed sure did have
>    plenty of choices.  What a shame I couldn't convince the driver to hold a
>    gear past 2000 RPM!  The redline is at 6700 RPM, in case you were wondering.
> 
>    Babe magnet factor:  Fish market!  The boss is happily married.  If I had
>    the car, I'd be running a babe taxi service to the nearest motel. Women
>    are attracted to this car like moths to a light.  There's no unicorn sh-t
>    near this car!
> 
>    Stealth:  Forget it!  He tried to sneak it into work so that nobody would
>    see him.  Within 15 minutes, at least 20 people were in his office asking
>    him how he could afford a 911 and a BMW on our employer's pitiful
>    salaries. You'd be surprised with the negative attitude displayed by many
>    drivers on the road towards this car.  They cut you off on purpose, then
>    hang you the bird.  People in lame cars, like Escorts, pull up alongside
>    you at traffic lights, make an unanswered challenge, then go off in a
>    cloud of burning tires to brag about how they beat the Porsche.
> 
>    Peace of mind:  Maybe it was just because it was a borrowed car, but even
>    I went and checked on it every half hour.  Somebody tried to break into it
>    while it's owner had it a few weeks earlier, and one lock cylinder was
>    badly damaged.
> 
>    Handling:  He did take it around a cloverleaf, and it felt great from the
>    passenger's seat.  At work, we have the world-famous "Vince Ferguson Speed
>    Dunes" strategically located in the parking lots.  My 16V used to bottom
>    out on them.  My VR6 just clears them.  His BMW scrapes many times.  The
>    security Caprice drags over them.  The 911?  It cleared them, shocking me
>    for one!
> 
>    Overall:  This thing's just a glorified Beetle.  If you would consider
>    spending mega bucks on one of them, then go for it.  It's a fun car to
>    have for a day, but you wouldn't want to live with it much longer.
>    There's got to be a better car.....
