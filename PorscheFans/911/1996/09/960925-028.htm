thanks to all who responded with respect to the problem encountered finding a
crystal for my watch....for the purposes of clarification....early watches
were made by orfina as opposed to IWC so that's a different company...the
authorized rep in USA for THIS watch is Superior watch co....in Brooklyn,
NY....1-800-275-4687..two crystals are available....mineral crystal-$78
installed and shipped....saphire crystaL-$278installed and shipped. The
interesting thing here is that the Porsche Design retail store in Beverly
Hills.Ca. [where the watch is right now] doesn't have the ability to install
the crystal...well anyway thanks again for the information.....a reminder
that the last IMSA  race of the year is at daytona OCT 4-5-6th.  I believe it
was on this net a few days ago that a discussion about the 959 evolved[right
word?]...anyway about 10 or 11 years ago...i spent the entire afternoon at
daytona on a tues or wed prior to a imsa event watching factory techs from
porsche put a white 959 through an afternoon of laps....it had dunlop tires
on it and it blew several tires as the afternoon went on....i was in the pits
watching this whole thing unfold...there must of been 15 or so techs and
engineers from the factory and also an elderly dunlop rep who didn't smile
much the entire afternoon.....as i understood it, the car was to race in the
weekend race but never was out again that week after the
afternoon....somewhere i have so video of this too....
