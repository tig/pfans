Maybe someone with more knowledge about such things can help me understand 
this situation that has me a bit angry: It doesn't help that I don't trust 
those dealer slimeballs as far as I can throw them. Here's the story:

I brought my '80 911 to the dealer for an oil change.

They tell me I need new front brake pads, so I get that done.

Then they tell me my ft. brake rotors are less than factory recommended 
thickness and recommend replacing while the wheels are off the car. OK, I 
say fine.

I get the car back and there is a terrible vibration in the steering 
column. Their explanation is the wheels were balanced on the car and that 
it is unorthodox to do it that way so they couldn't know that they had to 
put the wheels back on exactly as before. (I thought they test drove the 
cars after they fix them?)

So they balance the wheels for free (thanks).

I get the car back and still notice a bit of vibration at certain speeds. I 
take it back ask them what's up, because it was definitely fine before they 
took the wheels off. I assume they must have made a mistake balancing the 
wheels. $70 dollars later they tell me the wheels are balanced fine, the 
suspension fine. The only explanation is that the belts are separating 
inside one of the tires, causing the vibration. (Dunlop 40s). To prove this 
the mechanic showed me on the balancing machine how the tread "wanders" 
when the tire is turned. To tell the truth I couldn't see it but that 
doesn't mean it wasn't happening. Then he swapped the front and back tires 
and we drove it, he said if we don't feel the vibration then the problem is 
definitely belt separation. We didn't feel the vibration. He wouldn't take 
it up to 80 or 90 though, were I could really feel it.

Anyway, not only is this manufacturer's defect supposed to be rare, but I 
find it quite a coincidence that this all shows up after they work on it. 
The tires were bought by the PO and so I have no receipts to make claims 
against a warranty, anyway, I would have to replace both front tires.

Does this sound right?
