Since I only recently joined this list I don't know if this topic has
already been discussed. I tried looking through the archives but without
a search function, that quickly became unwieldy. 

Something on the order of $7K was contributed to the Porschephiles fund.
What has become of this money? Does Stan have it? Has Stan already spent
it on his own needs? I know the money was given no-strings-attached, but
it sure looks like it was used for a purpose other than what was
intended (which was to buy a computer to be dedicated to the running or
the p-philes list). Instead, both the list and the money are gone. Is
this a violation of our trust? A cyberspace crime? Or is there more to
an unfolding story?
