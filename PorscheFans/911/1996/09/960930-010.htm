Visual inspection of the exterior of the relay won't tell you much.
The contacts and coils are usual relay problem, and they are inside
under the cap.  I've poped the relay cover off before, scraped
the contacts, plugged it back in w/o the cover, and watched the
thing operate.  That can tell you alot.  I'm not saying the relay
is your problem, but you probably won't be able to tell by looking
at it from the outside.

For additional trouble shooting... After it has died, and you've
been cranking, can you smell raw gas in the exhaust pipe?  IOW,
do you think you're getting fuel? 

Keep Porsching,
