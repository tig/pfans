Hey P-fans,

What's the best way to check the alternator/voltage regulator to ensure 
that it is functioning correctly?  The alternator in question is on my 
'73 T, but is an '83 SC engine, which I assume means a Paris Rhone with 
the internal VR.  

The reason I ask is because my (fairly new) battery bit the big one last 
night.  After driving, without incident, to my folks place last night I 
left after a 45 minute stay and tried to start the car.  I heard the 
starter for a split second, then lost all power. No lights, no clicking, 
no radio, nada.  Well almost nada because the horn would give a faint 
squeal which was just audible.  I checked all mbattery and starter 
connections, thumped on the starter and solenoid  'cause it made me feel 
better and got no response.  At that point I was tired and cranky (unlike 
my car) so I left it to deal with today.  

It may just be a bad battery or something else, but I figured it would 
not be a bad idea to check some of the other electrical system components 
as well.

Thanks for any help.

Regards,

Rob Yasek
