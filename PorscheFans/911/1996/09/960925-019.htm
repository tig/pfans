	Wasn't there an SC-based AWD 911 built for one of the Paris-
Dakar rallies?  I know that's not going back as far as the SWB cars,
and the parts would be ultra-ultra-unobtainum, but still...

	I think it could be done, and probably for less than 10X the
cost of a C4.  Okay, maybe less than 20X.
	Really, all you'd have to do is cut-up and redesign the pan,
make an adaptor to use a VW Synchro tranny, make adaptors to use the
911 hubs, wheels, brakes, etc. with the Synchro drivetrain.  And you'd
better get four or five Synchro drive-trains, since you're likely to
blow a few of them up figuring out how everthing goes together...  And
you might have to chop up the drivetrain to make it fit correctly in
the car.  Might have to put a throttle stop in to keep from putting too
much power through the thing, unless you like replacing them all the
time...
	Not that much work, really.    ;)
