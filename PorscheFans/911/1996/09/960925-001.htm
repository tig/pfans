Rob,

        After reaching temperatures of 250 with my '84 Carrera on the track
I considered installing a fan but was advised by the list that the fan
helps at low speeds but not at high speeds.  Instead I removed the
passenger side fog lamp which provides a direct path to the radiator.  I
then installed a flat piece of  metal from the area of the fog lamp hole to
the radiator so that air entering the hole could not flow straight down and
out the underside of the car but had to flow directly to the cooler.
        When I was on the track two weeks ago the air temperature was 10
degrees cooler than my last track event but the oil temperature was 40
degrees cooler  (air temperature 75 and oil temperature 210).
        Since I never use the fog lamps anyway, in order to make the change
more pleasing to the eye I plan to remove the driver side fog lamp as well
and make a small grill to put in each hole.  Then I should have a permanent
fix that I don't have to change before and after track events without the
cost or appearance change of a new front valence/oil cooler system.
        Thanks to Bruce, Vic and Ray for their advice on this topic.
