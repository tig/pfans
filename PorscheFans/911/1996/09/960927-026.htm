Well, it's baaack...

The damn Porschephiles Phund question is up again. This becomes a contentious
topic whenever it arises, even people who didn't contribute a cent to it
start getting self-righteous about it, so IT IS OFF LIMITS ON PORSCHEFANS.
Last time it got ugly, I dropped two people who just couldn't leave it alone.

The Phund was the business of another list. That list is gone. That money is
gone too. I don't know where it ultimately went once Bart sent it to
Porschephiles, I do think it's a safe bet we'll never see it again, so let it
die. We have a new list. I don't want to read another word of it on this
list. If you have to talk about it, take it private.

Well said, Ted.
