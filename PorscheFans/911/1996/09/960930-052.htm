The engine has a temerature sensor on it that acts as a feed to the Motronic
brain; if the sensor is going such that the brain senses an overheating
condition, it will kill the engine.  A friend of mine had his act up at a
track
event at watkins glen; after 1-2 laps it would suddenly kill the engine, and 
wouldn't start until the car cooled down.  I would suggest have someone check
out the sensor and connections. Can't be more specific since I sold my '84
Carrera and the associated shop manuals in February.

 Subject: Relay?
 
 
 I still haven't figured out why my 84 911 has a starting problem. I did 
 take out the relay under the driver seat, but that thing seemed alright 
 visually. The new fact I did discover is that the car will start just 
 fine when cold, but stalls by itself while idling in the garage after, say, 
 five to ten minutes. Does this shed any new light? After the car has gone 
 on strike, it refuses to start till it completely cools down. 

 
 TIA,
 Geert
