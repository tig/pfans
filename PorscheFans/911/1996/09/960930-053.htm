Hi Bruce,
  I just had this done over the past week.  The new Porsche "consoles" are
expensive, I think $60 to $80 a piece at Automotion.  I fit in a Vision
Motorsports hollow rear sway bar.

On front sway bars, I understand that the '77 S uses a 19mm stock front non
through the body, while through the body types are preferred for
adjustability, but the non types will need a "U" bracket welded on.  Have
you ever compared the two designs in your writings or experience?

Ted

I'm still having a slight vibration when braking on the track. I've done about everything I
can think of... Calipers rebuilt, new pads, new rotors(fronts), tires-wheels checked for
runout and match balanced (3-4 times), new wheel bearings--set tighter than Porsche specs
(but not TOO tight). Last time I aligned it, the RF castor was a little less than the LF.
Would thsi make the vibration. No pulling when coming down from speed, just a slight
vibration. Brakes work fine, and I have no movement or vibration in the steering wheel or
pedal pulsation. Corner balance looks OK last time I checked it. I put 2 new tire/wheels on
it and moved them to the different corners, didn't make any difference...

I'm missing something---- I'm getting ready to put the car up on blocks to repaint it this
winter, but I wound like to get this annoyance taken care of before it's apart!!

Thanks for any imput....
