<< Pfans:
 Could anyone tell me or tell me where to find a listing of the factory   
 options available for 1975 911's?  More specifically options that could   
 be ordered with a Silver Anniversary Edition? I know this edition came   
 with a specific cloth interior and numbered plaque (mine is # 435) but I   
 don't know if they could be had from the factory with options such as   
 Fuch wheels, passenger side mirror and such or was this sort of thing   
 added by dealers?
 TIA
 Terry >>

Terry:

I bought one new and except for the cloth and leatherette interior and the
dash plaque, they had exactly the same options as the regular 911 line for
model year 1975.  BTW, the dash plaque number has no correlation with the
production serial number of the car.  That world-famous management and
automobile marketing conglomerate called the Porsche-Audi Division of VWoA
just mailed the plaques separately to the dealers in a box and just told them
to hand them out when they sold one of the Anniversary models.  There was no
right hand mirror option for the 75's as delivered.  Fuchs allows were
optional (cookie cutters standard).  Actually, the 75 911S Anniversary was a
"reduced price" model compared to the previous year's 911S.  The opening rear
quarter windows improved ventilation air flow significantly and was much
better than my 1988 Carrera with air conditioning which had little or no
outside air flow (without the *joke* AC on).
