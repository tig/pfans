Todd inquires:

" Given the amount of money Letterman makes and his penchant
          for Ferraris, this list is surprising, if it's his whole
          collection.  My guess is he's got some cars elsewhere.
          Also, query: why would Letterman have his car collection at
          Santa Monica Airport when he's in New York?  Climate?  He
          could certainly afford a temperature controlled environment."

There was a big list on the wall of each car and its location.  Some of 
his cars were under restoration and the chart identified their progress.  
I did not study it closely - the cars themselves held my attention.  There 
is a good chance that a few Ferraris were listed, but my recollection is 
that there were not.  The guy who showed me around used to work as a 
mechanic and possibly manager at Otto Zipper's agency, and had a German 
accent.  He told me that he was the one who guided Dave in his purchase 
decisions.  I guess that may be the reason for the clear lack of any 
Italian stallions.
