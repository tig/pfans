I also have KYB's on the rear end of my 73.5 911T.  The PPO put them on and 
when I put a Carrera front end on last winter I got some Adj. Koni's with 
the deal so I put those on front.  I know I will get a bunch of grief for 
admitting this but I really couldn't notice much of a difference.  I also 
have no reference so one of these days I will probably fork out the $$ and 
get 4 sport Bilstiens and then I will be able to make a real comparison.  I 
am also not an "advance driver" and have only been on the track a few 
times.  I guess this just tells me if the car has good sway bars (like 
mine) and your not an expert driver, the difference between Koni's and 
KYB's seemed pretty small at best.  Nomex is on.....  :)

Marc-

I have an opinion, FWIW.  The entire P-crowd will
probably descend on me en masse for saying this, but
I like the KYB's that are in my '72 911.  The car feels
nice and stiff, and the ride firm.  I use it daily,
and for autoxing and a track day when I can.  I'm
not the most experienced competitive driver, and it's
possible that I'd do just as well with no shocks at
all, but at least for me the KYB's are fine.

I have brand new Bilsteins on my other '72 911, and
I think they are fine too.  Perhaps a bit softer, but
it could just be the difference between the two cars.

I guess the conclusion that I've come to is that at
least for me the very much cheaper KYB's are fine.
