  I have a couple of 915 transmission questions as I will either be buying one
shortly or rebuilding the one I have (4th to 3rd does not an upshift make).
Actually I'll probably do both. Looking for a 915 with electronic speedo and
7:31 r&p, but not exactly sure how I want to approach it first.

1. What years were Magnesium cases? Was it 72-77?

2. What year did they start putting in electronic speedos as in the SC's? Was
it 78 or 76? I have heard both.

3. And of course, what that tells me is are there any magnesium cases with
electronic speedos?

4. The 7:31 ring and pinion ratio was only used up through 77 right?

Thanks,

PS. Yes Bruce, I'm still coming to the class. These weren't my only questions.
I'll try to find some harder ones for you.
