Hi Chuck,

I don't know where I am going astray. The 993 is the current version of the
911 which is also called the Carrera. Porsche hates to let go of old names
that work for them. 

The history of the current version of the 911 is sort of as follows: 

In the fall of 1993 Porsche introduced the 993 "The New 911 Carrera", which
was sold in Europe and the rest of the world as the 1994 model. For the US
market the "New 911 Carrera" (the 993) was introduced in the spring of 1994
as a 1995 model for the US market. The 993 hand been a 1994 model in Europe
introduced in the fall of 1993. The Cabriolet was introduced in March of 1994
as a 1994 model for Europe and a 1995 model for the US. 

The new 993 based Carrera was introduced in September of 1993 as having 30%
new technology for the same or a lower price depending upon where it was
sold. In the US the 993 was actually priced lower than the C2 coupe that it
replaced. The C2 coupe had sold for $64,990 and the 993 sold for $59,900 in
1994. The 993 seemed to be more than just 30% new, it was a real step forward
from the old 911. The 964, when it was introduced, was billed as 85% new
parts and although it was a radical departure from the old 911 it just looked
like a warmed over 911, and it was considered by most to be an evolutionary
step. Well if the 964 was an evolutionary step the 993 is two further
evolutionary steps. The new body style updated all of the old hallmarks of
the 911 into a bright new looking car. The new bodywork creates the most
significant appearance change in the history of the 911 while retaining the
911's classic identity. The 993 Retained the pop up rear spoiler which not
only improved the cars aerodynamics, but also enhanced the engine cooling
when it was up. The original prototypes were shown with the third stop light
integral with the rear roof molding at the top of the rear window. When the
993 show up on our shores instead of this integral stop light they had a
silly looking picnic basket handle mounted on the engine lid with the light
built in. It wasn't until the Turbo was introduced that the integral stop
light showed up on the US production cars. The 1996 Carrera coupe shared this
much more attractive integral stop light with the Turbo. 

The 911 3.6 liter air cooled engine for the 993 was further developed to now
produce 270 hp. The engine incorporated maintenance free hydraulic valve
lifters for the first time in the 911 history. The engine management had been
updated and the flapper box used for air flow measurement was replaced with
the hot film flow sensing meter. A new three into two exhaust system was
developed for the 993, the first major change in the exhaust since 1975. The
outlet of this new exhaust merges into two catalytic converters and two
separate muffler. The engine changes produced more horsepower and more torque
with improved emissions and fuel consumption and without increased weight. 

A completely new five link multi-link rear suspension was developed for the
993 which improved the ride, the handling and was quieter than the early
swing arms suspensions used on the 911. The multi link rears suspension
utilized transverse A-arms with a toe-in link and was all contained on a
subframe. The front suspension was further developed and revised to work with
the new rear suspension and new wheels were used on the 993 based Carrera. 

The 993 had a new six-speed version of the G-50 transmission as well as a
further developed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Larger front brake discs,
with larger front pads, and cross drilled front and rear disc improved the
already unmatched braking of the 911s. Because if the increased horsepower
and torque the 993 based version of the 911 was had better acceleration and a
higher top speed than its predecessor. The 993 based Carrera was quieter
inside and out. The air conditioning and ventilation system was improved by
the addition of particle filters. The seating was improved by redesigned
seats. Driver and passenger safety was improved by improving both the drivers
and passengers air bags. The windshield wipers were redesigned to cover more
of the windshield and by using a larger area of double coverage for better
cleaning. New modular ellipsoid projection type headlights were used for the
first time for improved lighting. 

The Tiptronic S model was introduced in late August of 1994. This new S
version had additional shift controls on the steering wheel like some of the
Formula 1 cars do. You push up on a button on either side of the steering
wheel up to shift up and down on the bottom side of either button to shift
down. 

The Twin 911 Turbo C4 was introduced at the Geneva Auto show in March 1995
and marketed in the US as a 1996 model year car. The engine, M64/60 was based
on the 993 M64/05 normally aspirated engine. The complete crank drive
assembly from the 993 engine was used with the connecting rods that were
reinforced in the transition area between the big end and the rod beam. A new
piston design was used which used a Grafal coating. The coating is
silk-screened onto the skirts of the pistons and helps to reduce piston slap
noise caused by thrust loads. The pistons also have grooves forged into the
top piston land to reduce the effect of combustion loads on the top ring
land. 

The cylinders were the same100 mm size as the 993, were forged cylinders
rather than the cast cylinders normally used. The forged cylinders are used
for added strength and this was the first time forged cylinders for a
production engine, they had been used in racing engines because of some
special problems before, but not a production engine. They have used them
because of combustion sealing problems and problems caused by the severe rod
angles of the long stroke racing engines. 

The intake ports were increased to 43 mm and the exhaust to 38 mm and ceramic
pot liners were used in the exhaust ports to reduce the cylinder head
temperature. They used a spring steel ring inserted into a grove in the top
of the cylinder to provide a seal for the cylinder head. They also extended
the piston travel up 5 mm into the combustion chamber to further reduce the
combustion loads on the cylinders. Extending the piston travel into the
combustion chamber moves the point of extreme pressure away from the junction
of the cylinder and cylinder head. To improve the cylinder head cooling the
fin area has been made as large as possible and the cooling fins have been
made thinner to reduce are flow resistance. They also used smaller cyliner
head nuts with a thinner cross section to reduce their restriction to the
cylinder head air flow. The cylinder head nuts also have a larger seating
area to provide a more even pressure over a larger portion of the cylinder
head. 

The valve mechanism if the Turbo is the same as from the 993. They did change
to a sodium cooled exhaust valve for improved cooling. The camshaft intake
lift was changed to 11.6 mm and the exhaust lift was 10.5 mm. . The intake
opens 12x BTDC and closes 63x ABDC, and the exhaust opens 56x BBDC and closes
5x ATDC. The rockers and rocker shafts remained the same.

The engine lubrication is the same as the 993 normally aspirated engine and
exhaust ports are provided from the left and right chain tensioners to supply
oil to the turbochargers. A twin stage oil pump it built into the A/C mount
and driven by a gear on the end of the engine's layshaft scavenges the oil
from the turbochargers back to the oil tank. 

The twin turbo engine uses the same 245 mm eleven bladed cooling fan as the
previous turbo model did driven at a 1.8:1 ration for an output of 1210
liters per second at 6100 rpm. 

To reduce mass inertia two small turbochargers are used, each supplying a
large separate intercooler into a common intake plenum. The fuel needs and
ignition timing and electronic boost pressure control are all controlled by
the M 5.2 version of the Motronic. This system is adaptive and operates over
a wider ranger than the previous units. 

The twin turbo had a completely revised exhaust system with a separate
catalytic converter and muffler for each half of the motor. Each of the
turbos have vacuum controlled wastegates. The engine utilized the new OBD (On
Board Diagnostics) II Diagnosis system which requires an oxygen sensor before
and after each catalytic converter for a total of four. 

The Motronic system provides electronic control of boost pressure based on
intake air mass, has sequential injection, adaptive oxygen sensor regulation,
adaptive knock control,adaptive boost charge control and air mass metering
with a hot-film mass air flow sensor.
