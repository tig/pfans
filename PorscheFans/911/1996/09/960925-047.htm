Todd:

I thought about this too, but if you read his post carefully, you'll
see that he happily accepts that the 911 is suitable for "driving
ludicrously fast", but then dismisses that fact as an unimportant (to
him) aspect of an automobile's appeal.

Given that he's primarly concerned with egonomics, I think his
comments were fair and right on the money (and, incidentally, 
rather unimportant to anyone whose primary reason for owning a 911
has nothing to do with ergonomics and comfort).
