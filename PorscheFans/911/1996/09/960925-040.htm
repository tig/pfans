That's why we exited our 'friendly' local VW list.  It seems that everyone
was a smartass and nobody wanted to give you a straight answer.  Like the
time when my Brother asked the list about differences between his 86 VW
Scirroco with an automatic transmission and one with a 5 speed?  The answer
was "It's called performance", and that was it.

But then again, I agreed with half of what he said.  And I also agreed
that's why we love our Porsche's so much because not many other people in
this world can understand them.  

Besides, I love a good chuckle.
