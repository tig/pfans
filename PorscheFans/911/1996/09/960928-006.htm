I am having some major league electrical problems with a '68 911 and I'm
hoping someone can offer some corrective suggestions...

The symptom:  I turn the key and _nothing_ happens.  Yet all the electrical
applications work fine (radio, lights, -fuel pump-, whatever)

I run jumper cables to another car and it fires up within a 1/2 second.

Unhook the cables, turn the car off.  Try to restart it, nothing.

Parts that have been replaced over the last three years (for a variety of
reasons - rebuilt ignition switch, new coil, new rotor & points, all new
ground straps, new starter, new battery (3rd in a year - two Diehards and
now an Interstate...  And I can't find any shorts/drains in the system.

What the *(*%(#$ is wrong with this thing?  It's been plaguing me off and on
for over a year.  I'm about ready to push the car over a cliff.

So my questions are:

The alternator is about the only thing left - when the engine is running,
voltage across the battery flits between 13 and 14 volts.  But does that
rule out the alternator is the source of my problems?

The only other thing I can think of, is just blow the money and replace the
whole wiring harness (which is a mess anyway) or probably spend just as much
cash to have some one else spend weeks looking for the short and just
correcting that one problem.  (Yes, someone else - I'm that ticked, I'm
almost ready to wash my hands of the whole car).  So this question is: bout
how much would cost to replace the wiring harness?

The thing that really hurts, though, once I get the damn thing started, it
runs GREAT!  sigh

Anyway,  if you have any ideas, could you please email me directly, I'm on
digest mode and the server doesn't like me and occasionaly loses my mail (It
probably chats with my car...)

Thanks again,

scotts@sprintmail.com                                 Madness takes its toll...
