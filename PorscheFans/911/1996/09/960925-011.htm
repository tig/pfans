Basically, NO! A german guy that works near me even said that if you're c=
aught
with one they remove your licence as you have shown you are "unfit" to dr=
ive.

In other countries it's not iilegal to have one, but illegal (semi) to us=

- often done through "Obstructing the police in their duty..

Some places they work for some radar - I can't remember for Germany (thin=
k
so) but, for example, in France and in Switzerland they use some newer ra=
dar's
which are out of the bandwidth covered by SuperWideBand detectors from th=
e US.

Probably - say it's a car alarm etc. It would probably be confiscated in =
