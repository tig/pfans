  Not sure what you are doing but the suspension mods seem almost mandatory
for being competitive in the club racing scene. 
  I will comment on adding goodies to the SC suspension. I'm not an expert on
the mods, but I've got a couple and really enjoy it.It's great fun on the
track and capable of catching bigger powered cars with the right driver. It's
plenty of power to learn with (even the stock SC is) and more than capable of
scaring the living daylights out of passengers and driver. I'm honestly not
able to drive mine consistently near its limits yet because the limits are
further out than they used to be and I'm learning where they are. Sometimes I
exceed 'em.  =8^O  Just do it and have fun.
  I see by your last statement that you've already found the only real
problem with modifying your car. Mine was stock when I bought it.
Good Luck and See You at the Track,
Rob Channell
