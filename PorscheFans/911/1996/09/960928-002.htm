Thanks for the input on the suspension on my new/old 86 911.  Lots of help.
Lots of work.

Next thing on the list is the air flow.  All of the plastic and the Bosch air
flow meter is gone.  Replaced by ???????? with a cone shaped filter that goes
straight right.  A black plastic ?????? (electronic) is attached to the ?????
(metal housing) that obviously replaces the air flow meter and is wired
(crudely in black electrician's tape) to the stock wiring.

I assume this apparatus is designed to 1)alter the air/fuel mixture
2)decrease the effectiveness of the pollution controls or 3) go faster.
  (Now who would want to do that?)

Idles nicely, no hestitation with or without load,  compression in all six is
on spec. The same Bosch air flow meter really didn't like even minimal loss
of compression on other cars. I assume it was the same with this one.
 Oklahoma doesn't have much testing requirements or they are not too strictly
enforced, so virtually anything will pass.  Plugs look fine. No black smoke.
Haven't checked gas mileage yet but it seems low.  The latter may be due to
the close proximity of my right foot and the firewall.

No documentation for this thing, so if you have any ideas on the manufacturer
and where to get some real info on it, please let me know.  It seems to be
working so I'm not too worried.

Thanks
David Murphy
