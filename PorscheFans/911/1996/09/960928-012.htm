> ... referring to the spoiler as a "retractable engine vent" ...

Hey guys, there's a nugget of truth in the "retractable engine vent" comment.

The black vanes on the rear vent do shunt airflow into the engine
compartment when the spoiler is in the lowered position. However, when the
spoiler on a 964 is in its raised position it carries up with it a black
plastic pleated panel that closes off the back of the space between the
rear of the raised spoiler and the engine compartment.  This effectively
captures the air shunted through the spoiler down into the engine bay. If
this is gone, or cracked, that cooling air will spill out from the
underside of the spoiler and be wasted.

I recently noticed that this plastic panel had cracked along a pleat on my
'91 C4, and separated thus leaving me a large opening between the spoiler
and the rear lid. 964 owners may want to check this part by raising their
spolier and eyeballing from the back of the car. It's an easy snap-in
replacement part.
