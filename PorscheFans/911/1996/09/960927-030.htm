Yes, it's common.  I have an '87 Targa, and it started the same leak
about 3 years ago.  Note: the Cab and Targa share the same front
and side seals, so we get the same problem (more or less).

No, I used to live in Houston where it rains HARD off and on ALL the
time.
Correspindingly, the my top was off and on all the time.  For the first
3 years I owned the car, it sealed perfectly.  And, I assume the initial
owner had a dry car also.

I'm still putzing with that one.  I've spent $$$ and
time on it with no real success yet.

They are not terribly hard to replace, just hard to position
correctly.  Like I said, I've spent time and $$$ on the problem
at various body and upholstery shops.  But, they have different
priorities (move 'em out and collect $$) than I (dry car).  So,
I haven't found a shop to take the time to do it right and TEST
the result.  So, next, I'm going to fiddle with them myself.

First, try adjusting the vent window and current side seal positions.

If that fails... then
Buy Genuine Porsche seals.  They're expensive, but the aftermarket ones
are NOT the same.

Finally, DIY.  Most shops just don't care about the result.

Keep Porsching,
