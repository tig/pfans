A few years ago, I was lucky enough to visit the 'Big Dog Garage' as Leno's
facility is called. It is a plain concrete-walled industrial building
adjacent to the runways at the West end of Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena
Airport.

He has a truly odd collection of cars from a '56 Buick convertible to a
dual-cowl Duesenberg. A black Viper, replica 427 Cobra and lots of
Lamborghinis. One of the most interesting cars is a Hispano Suissa with an
18+ liter (!) aircraft engine. The whole car appears to be made from beaten
heavy-gauge aluminum. The motorcycle collection is even more impressive,
with Vincents and other classics. At the time, he and I both had a Norton
Commando John Player Special--a bike that was completely stock
performance-wise, but with a racing cowl, rear sets, etc. His comment on
the bike was hilarious. He said it was kinda like a transvestie: can look
great from a distance, but when you climb on it, something seems not quite
right...

Funny guy, and nice as can be.

P.S. Some of Seinfeld's collection can be seen in the Porsche promotional
video on the 1996 993. It includes a white Super Beetle convertible :-P
