Hi Terry:

I don't have a list of options but I owned one of these 1975 " Silver 
Anniversary" models in 1987.     This was a Euro 911S Targa.   It had Fuchs, 
dual flag-style electric mirrors,  electric windows and the funky 
hounds-tooth interior.    The front seats had been replaced with nice deep 
Recaros and it had an aftermarket Nardi steering wheel which I wish I'd 
kept.  I forgot what number it was but don't think there was anything too 
special about it though it was my first Porsche and got me hooked.    It 
only took finishing college, getting married, having 2 kids and another 5 
years before I was able to get another one.

Regards,

Steve Jagernauth

Pfans:
Could anyone tell me or tell me where to find a listing of the factory
options available for 1975 911's?  More specifically options that could
be ordered with a Silver Anniversary Edition? I know this edition came
with a specific cloth interior and numbered plaque (mine is # 435) but I
don't know if they could be had from the factory with options such as
Fuch wheels, passenger side mirror and such or was this sort of thing
added by dealers?
TIA
Terry
75 911S
