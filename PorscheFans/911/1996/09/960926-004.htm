The 88 '911 I got a couple of months ago came with two set of 
wheels:  BBS wheels mounted, and the original Fuchs wheels. 

Winter is coming up - at least here in Green Bay.  I was 
going to mount snow tires or all-weather tires on the 
black Fuchs.  Unfortuntely the finish is worn.  Any suggestions 
on how to recreate the black finish - I don't think I can 
restore it.  It looks like a special paint on them.  Anything 
special to consider?

Also I have lately heard a "Klonk" sound from the front 
left of the car - like a loose screwdriver:).  It seems to come 
from around the fuel tank, but could be the front left wheel 
area.  The sound mostly comes when I corner right.  At least 
once I thought it was the fuel, but then I think that 
was a different sound.  I wanted to see if anyone had any 
advice.  I am probably taking it to a mechanic just in case 
(okay - I'm clueless when it comes to repairing them)

BTW - How about a library of sounds, with associated names, so 
we can differentiate between Klong, Kling, and Klank? Just a 
thought!!!
