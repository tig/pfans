(Like the Cosworth reference below I assume....)

Autofarm's mechanics suggestion was, presumably because Autofarm deal oft=

with people
running 911's on a budget, to avoid engine and cylinder head removal.

All of which involves major expense - I agree totally with Bruce's =

comments/answer
but if the owner wants to do this "in car" what other solutions are there=
????

I agree that the cost of fixing this, if it does go wrong, is high but wh=
en the
local Porsche dealer (to me) wants $300 (yes) just to change the oil (and=
 there
are no cheaper alternatives) then for me it may be the choice between kee=
ping
the car on the road, or not..

Agreed, in the long run it's not a good solution and Bruce's comments are=
 =

perfectly
correct, but it isn't always a perfect world.

yes - but how many horror storys have you heard about these bolts through=

the years. Whilst it may be a damn good solution on a drawing board it's
not what I would call, in hindsight, a major success story!

You hit it on the head, "to win". We're talking about cars used everyday =
- not
race cars that are broken down x times per season.

Aha, not *the* engineer were we?? :-)

Seriously, not everything that Porsche engineers is 100% wonderful - thro=
ughout
the years there have been "known" problems - fortunately fewer than
other manufacturers I think. =
