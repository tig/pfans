I am in the middle of assembling my 2.4T motor.  Have the layshaft, =
crank and case together, and have a question about the oil pressure and =
safety=20
valves.

I had my case machined to include the 1976 oil bypass modification, and
have the updated oil valve pistons (the ones without the holes).  My bag =
of
parts includes 2 springs (1 long, 1 short), 2 pistons, 2 plugs and =
washers,=20
and an additional metal rod, that would fit inside of one of the =
springs.

Questions:

1) The pressure relief valve is directly under the oil pressure sending =
unit,
these two are connected by a straight unblocked hole running through the =

case, correct?  The reason I am asking, is that I found a washer logged =
inside
this passage, and have pushed it out, so now I can look through the =
case.

2) The oil safety valve is on the left side of the case next to the oil =
pump,
correct?

3) Which spring do I use for the pressure relief, and which spring is =
for the
safety valve.

4) Do I use the metal tube inside one of the springs, or is the tube for =
later
model cars (my engine is a 1972 2.4T)?

5) As a general rule during engine building, should all metal sufaces =
that
touch other metal have a coating of engine oil?  If so, should the=20
oil springs, pistions, and bores have a coating of oil before I install =
them?

TIA,

Todd
