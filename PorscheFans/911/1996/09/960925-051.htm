I would assume so. The fronts are supposedly identical in terms of
bodywork, so unless there is a recessed hub/different inner fender
arrangement on the Turbo/C4S allowing a wider front wheel, anything that
fits the front of a Turbo/C4 should fit the 993 as well.

Don't know about this, but I would assume not. A small point to mention,
though is that the C4S wheel and the Turbo wheel are not identical. The
Turbo wheels are hollow spoke/friction welded two piece while the C4S
wheels are solid one piece forgings.
