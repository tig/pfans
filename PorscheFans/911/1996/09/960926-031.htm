My '86's engine is basically stock, with just an Autothority chip. I
have been thinking about trying to improve the breathing of the engine.
Towards this end, I am considering a B&B Tri-Flow header/muffler system
and a K&N filter. I have already drilled out the air cleaner cover which
did make a noticeable difference in the throttle response.

Several mail order parts houses are now offering bored out throttle
bodies and higher pressure fuel regulators. By themselves, I am sure
they won't do much. But combined with a tuned, high flow exhaust and a
chip, would they help much? The term "much" is of course subjective. I
guess the best way to quantify it would be in terms of lap times.
Suppose I already had the headers and lapped Seattle Int'l Raceway in
1:45. Do you think I would notice an improvement in lap times with these
two gizmos? Or from an autocross perspective, would they increase
throttle response and low end torque enough to make a difference to my
cone traversal times?

Has anyone actually bought and installed these things?
