Just an addition to Bruce's note on the history of the 993. In 
Canada, the 993's were available in calendar 94 offered for sale as 
95 models, just as Bruce stated. In 1995 993's had some running 
changes early in the model year compared to the "94's". There was a 
different air intake under the driver's side of the engine lid and 
the vinyl fender protectors (rear wheels) were made larger. There 
were probably many other changes, but those two were visible between 
my 993 Cab bought in may 94 and my 993 coupe bought in March 95.

Late 95 cars sold here as of October 95 or so had the "96" third 
light i.e. no basket handle and the Varioram engine too. I figure 
Porshce makes running changes and model year designations don't mean 
as much to them as to other manufacturers.

By the way, I sold the Cab because I had fallen in love with track 
events and there was no way I wanted to install a roll cage (a bar 
would have been ok) for DEW.

Bob
