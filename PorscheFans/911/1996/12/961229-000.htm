Lyle, Pfans,

The 2.7 engine isn't just fussy, it has a few fatal flaws, that need to be corrected if the 
engine is not to self destruct.  The first and most important is the timing-chain tensioners.  
The original ones tend to go catastrophically between 50K and 100K miles.  Requiring a full, 
long block engine rebuild (pistons, cylinders, heads, connecting rods, valves,  . . . , 
all-in-all about $8K worth).   The remedy is to replace the original tensioners (including the 
timing chain covers) with 1984 Carrera tensions which are oil fed.  (and can be identified by 
small oil lines that run into the front of the timing chain cover.  Also try to get a copy of 
this months Panorama magazine (from Porsche Club of America), which has an article on these oil 
lines including pictures.

The second major problem with the '76 is the studs that hold the cylinders and heads to the 
crankcase.  These can pull out of the crankcase, especially if the engine gets hot (another '76 
problem) as in running on a track in a drivers ed event or autocross, (or getting stuck in 
traffic for that matter).   The best solution is raceware studs that expand at the same rate as 
the crankcase, second best is stud inserts in the crankcase.

The third major problem is overheating.  The 5 bladed fan should be exchanged for an 11 bladed 
fan (later models are better since they turn faster, but make sure the outer pulley half 
matches the fan, or the pulley half will fail, probably when its most inconvenient).  Make sure 
the timing and fuel mixture are set correctly, misagdjustments can also cause overheating.  If 
you plan to track or autoX your 911, an auxiliary front mounted oil cooler can completely 
correct (maybe overcorrect) the overheating problem.

The other joys of this vintage include oil leaks and oil fumes entering the passenger 
compartment when the "heater" is on.   But it's a strong running enging that will put out 
enough HP to get you good and scared whenever you want to be.  On the track mine kept up with 
some faster 3.0s & 3.2s that were better equiped for the track (tires & suspension mods).

Hope this helps.

I'm looking at a 76 911.  I'm also learning as I go.  Can anybody tell me
if this is a good or bad year.  Plusses or minuses etc. Other than the
air conditioning it seems the only things wrong are minor cosmetics.
Thanks for the help.
