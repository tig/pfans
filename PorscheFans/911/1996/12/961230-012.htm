Pete,

I'm sorry but I must have missed it.  Where did Gary Griffith recount
Porsche's One Lap efforts?  I didn't see David Murry drive the Porsche in One
Lap any harder than I would.  I thought the object of the game was to win.
 However, I did hear that it was Hurley Haywood's personal car and the same
that was used to win the previous year.

Gary,

More good news! The proposed schedule for 1997 One Lap shows that we'll start
at Watkins Glen, go to MIS, then St. Louis, (by-passing Heartland Park?) to
Longmont and also Denver, on west to Las Vegas, back to Hallett, Memphis,
Putnam Park, Lancaster and finish at Watkins Glen. The little extension
westward will mean approximately 1500 more miles than last year. Should be
fun! (if we make it through I-70)

Zane
