I recently purchased a '89 C4 with about 90K miles.  When cold, I often get a
warning light, and sometimes the warning chimes for the transaxle.  This
usually goes away when the car starts to move forward, but sometimes I get
the warning chime at start-up which goes away as soon as I start to drive,
along with the warning indication.  Twice in one month the warning light and
chime have come on while driving (no unusual conditions).  As soon as I turn
the engine off and re-start it goes away.  Anybody have a clue?  The trans.
seems to work OK. It locks and unlocks OK and nothing seems to be wrong.
I will verify a previous post about clutch slippage.  I one time tried a very
spirited launch, and the clutch slipped big time, with a big stink.  It seems
fine, but I will never do it again!
Any info. on this model car would be deeply appeciated, as I am a novice.
Thanks,
Tad
