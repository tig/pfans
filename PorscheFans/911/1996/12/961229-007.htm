Just a personal data point and some observations and personal opinions here:

The 2.7 US car is notorious for longevity in the various books, yet I have
run into few owners who get < 100K or even 150K on the '77 version which has
some engine goodies like stronger guide valve material, dilivar studs on
exhaust side, etc., and my own personal '77 was still strong at 125K, but
leaked about a quart a week so I replaced with 3.0l sc engine with no leaks.

Now on the oil pump, there has been an upgrade, see the '74 to '89 tech
notes for this update. The 11 blade fan upgrade is highly recommended.  An
oil cooler is highly recommended for longevity since many of these '75 - '77
didn't even come with a hoop cooler.  Oils are better now than they were 20
years ago...The carrera tensioner upgrade is highly recommended as is a pop
off valve, but these improvements are independent of the 2.7, they should be
considered for any pre '84 carrerra engine.

CIS is great.  No computers in my Porsche.  I have a dozen in my house, and
that's enough.

A '78 to '83 'SC coupe is a great car and comes with the 3.0l aluminum
engine but you still need many of the above upgrades like tensioners and pop
off valve.  Also, the SC's allow wider rubber in the rear if you're into
that drag racing street thing...

If you do get a 2.7 litre car, you should upgrade the oil pump to a later
version.

it works just fine.  (I own two CIS cars.)
