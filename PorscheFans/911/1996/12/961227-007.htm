I have quite a story for you.   PLEASE question the integrity
of the dealerships and/or service centers you trust your
Porsche with.    Hopefully reading about my experience
will serve as a warning to Porsche owners everywhere.

I live in Austin, Texas. and, until Wednesday November 20th
I was the proud owner of a mint condition Red 1990 Carrera
2 with really low miles. 

I had a fender bender and took it to Lipshy Motorcars,
the only franchised Porsche Dealership in Austin as far
as I know. I thought that I was doing the best thing I 
could since it looked liked there would probably be
some painting involved.  The Service Advisor at 
Lipshy informed me that they do not have their own
body shop but that they always deal with a reputable
place in Austin.

I said that they should do whatever they normally do.

I got a call on November 21st from the Lipshy Service
Advisor who proceeded to tell me that my car was 
involved in another accident while being towed to the 
body shop. The car actually came off the straps as the 
wrecker turned into the body shop. My Porsche 911
then continued, unattended, through an intersection 
and was broad-sided by a pickup truck going about 
45 mph ! 

In a state of shock, I went and looked at what was left 
of my once beautiful car, and believe me, it was not a 
pretty sight.  Everything was crushed, bent and dented.
I asked the body shop guy what would NOT have to be 
replaced and he replied, "the hood and a fender might 
make it".  He was pretty sure the entire frame was twisted 
as well.

Well, it all gets worse.  Much worse.

The good news (I guess you can call it that) is that the
car turned out to be a total loss.  They are not going 
to attempt to repair it.

But the dealership, Lipshy Motorcars, is completely
shrugging off all responsibility in my opinion!

It turns out that the wrecker company Lipshy
subcontracted to (Finger Towing, Inc., also in 
Austin, TX) only had $10,000 worth of coverage 
for the "cargo" they tow.  Now this is alarming 
since Lipshy's Service Advisor informed me 
that they have used this towing company exclusively 
for years.  By the way, they put my car in a 
sling (as opposed to a flatbed towtruck) !! 
I can only assume that mine was not the first 
Porsche they had submitted to such torture.

How many of you own a Porsche that is worth
less than $10,000?  That's what I thought.

Then, Lipshy Motorcars went and called 
MY INSURANCE COMPANY without my 
permission and told them that since Finger 
Towing's insurance would not cover it, my 
insurance would have to cover the car!  Yes,
I thought this was completely ludicrous also. But
it seems that my insurance company (State Farm)
has turned out to be, in my opinion, the only
party involved in this mess with a bit of ethics, 
not to mention business sense.

Speaking of, you would think that it would just 
make good business sense try and keep a customer 
happy, especially in this kind of situation were 
they obviously screwed up and didn't do their 
homework when it came to choosing a wrecker service.
But do you think they have gone out of their way 
to see that I am happy?  Hell no. I doubt they 
plan on ever calling me again to tell you the truth.

I had to go through my own insurance company just
to keep a rental car. Since my insurance only covers
$20 a day, I thought the least Lipshy Motorcars could
do was to pick up the tab for a nice Volvo or
something. 

But NO!  The Lipshy Service Manager haggled with
me on the phone for 30 minutes as I sat at an
Enterprise Rent-a-car regarding the price of the
car I had rented.  As it turns out, they were willing
to pay $9 a day over what my insurance would pay
but not $18 a day to put me in a little nicer car.
He said that he felt that it was $9 a day they
weren't responsible for paying!  Hey, I mean even
the Volvo wasn't my Porsche that was wrecked after
I dropped it off at Lipshy Motorcars.  It made me
want to puke to hear that guy wiggle on the
phone over $9 a day.  I wanted to ask him "This
is a PORSCHE DEALERSHIP I'm talking to, isn't it??!!"

At one point I mentioned that I had talked to an
attorney for advice who had told me that I was 
entitled to a comparable temporary car.  At this, 
the Lipshy Service Manager went and talked to the
General Manager of Lipshy Motorcars and when 
he came back  he told me that if I got an Attorney 
involved they would stop paying anything toward 
a rental and would have to stop talking with me.  
Sounded a bit like a threat to me.  Not to mention 
the part when he went on to say that "Mr. Lipshy
is involved in a lot more than just this dealership, 
he's very involved in Texas politics and he's very 
connected".

I didn't bother to ask what that was supposed to
mean.  Or how it was in any way related to the 
fact that I was still without my Porsche
that I had left in the care of Lipshy Motorcars.
Or the fact that it is now rusting away in a  scrap
yard somewhere.

He called me back a few days later and left a message
on my answering machine just to make sure that I 
had switched to the cheaper car.  I haven't heard
anything else from Lipshy Motorcars. 

I have since spoken to others in the auto trade and 
repair industry who have agreed that this sort of
thing happens more frequently than many might 
suspect.  Many dealerships and service centers
"roll the dice" by using cheaper towing companies
that do not carry adequate insurance coverage.  They
can pay $35 per tow as opposed to $65 for a premium
wrecker service.  

I also spoke with my cousin who is part owner of
a wrecker service here in Austin who said that 
premium, reputable wrecker services would never
dream of putting a high-end automobile on anything
else but a flat-bed tow truck.  He said that, for one
thing, its difficult to even tow a Porsche on a sling
without dragging on the pavement (ouch!).

I guess the lessen learned is that you should ALWAYS
QUESTION THE ARRANGEMENTS SURROUNDING
THE TOWING OF YOUR PORSCHE!!  MAKE SURE
THEY WILL BE USING A FLAT-BED TOW TRUCK
AND THAT THEY HAVE PLENTY OF CARGO
INSURANCE TO COVER YOUR CAR!!!

Also, make sure you ask around regarding the 
reputation of any dealership or service center you
plan to use.  The way they do business and 
handle customer relations will definitely impact 
you as soon as something like this happens.  
Believe me, I know.

Feel free to post this message where ever you think
it might serve as a good warning against dealerships
and service centers that haven't done their homework
and might not be willing to accept responsibility
for their actions.
