Oops forgot I was on digest, so I had to resend

You wrote>>I have a 69 911T euro and would like to undertake the replacement
of the front suspension pan mine seem to be ok for know but if I decide to
keep 
this car for long time I would like to replace the pan!! The frame tubes on 
either side of the car are like new really solid!! Has anyone tried to do
this!!!
Any tips ???? >>

A.P. - I had to do mine this past summer (1970 911T).  Pretty common problem
with
with these cars.  Attibuted to leaking batteries.  I bought the pan from an
outfit advertizing in Pano for $180.  Had it done by a local shop for about
$300.  Make sure your shop is reputable and it's best if they have done it
before.
