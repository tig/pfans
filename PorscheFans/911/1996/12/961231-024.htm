You have correctly assessed that this is no fun.  Best done with the engine
out, however...

As I remember, it goes underneath the compressor bracket (?), and you should
consider removing the bracket.  The trick, if you can call it that, is to
start at the right side with the smaller hose, and get it trimmed and
attached to the step-up bushing.  Then attach the untrimmed larger hose to
the bushing.  Tighten the clamps tightly, because you will now have to bend
the contraption into place.  Then place the compressor.  Then clamp the
larger hose to the bracket over the fan and do your final trimming to meet
the fan housing bushing.  If you have a configuration where the small hose
is not UNDER the compressor bracket, the same advice applies with regard to
starting from the right.  You might find it useful to remove the small
sheetmetal piece where the hose passes down to the heat exchanger.  Not easy
to get to, but possible.  

Again, best done with the engine out.
