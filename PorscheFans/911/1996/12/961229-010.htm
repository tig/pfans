Hi,

Come on, you made that up. The 2.7 engines never had any problems with
scavenging. The 1978 and 1979 911SC engines were the engines with a
scavenging problem and they are the engines that run for ever.

> Ray,

The engine overheating in the 2.7 litre cars was as much due to a lousy oil
pump as anything else.  It wouldn't scavenge oil adequately from the sump,
the level would rise, and the crank turning in the oil heated it quickly.  If
you do get a 2.7 litre car, you should upgrade the oil pump to a later
version.

If you Timesert the magnesium case's studs, they will be fine, esp. for a
street car.  I don't think the CIS engine management is problematic at all,
it works just fine.  (I own two CIS cars.)
