Eric, I agree with the other responses "don't cave on this". One point I
would like to make is regarding your comment about the insurance coverage of
the towing company. They claim to only have $10,000 coverage. Too bad. That
doesn't reduce their liability, only their reimbursement. If damage is caused
that is their responsibility, they pay. Since they were an agent of the
dealership, the dealership would be ultimately responsible. I believe you
also said that your own insurance compay is picking up the difference. If so,
you don't have much control  over who pays. But you should be made "whole"
again.
