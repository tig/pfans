Eric,

I also agree with Anthony Stevens' reply.  I would contact an attorney
first.  State Farm (I have them also) has been very helpful with past
issues.  In Pennsylvania, I had an incident where my insurance company paid
me first, then went out and sued the offending party for the total damages.
If State Farm does this, I would imagine that they will file suit against
whoever they deem has the deep pockets and could be held accountable.

Remember, keep your cool.  Discuss with your attorney what you want to get
out of this.  I would think you could get punitive damages as well, but
there is a price to be paid for such actions in the end.  A tactical
approach is what is needed.

It may be possible (highly likely) that you could get a favorable
settlement from the dealer and not burn any bridges between the two of you.
I remember an incident where a very young me had a problem with service
rendered on a motorcycle of mine.  My father strategically chewed them out
in such a way that not only did I get the problem fixed, but subsequent
services were so good that there was no question about returning to that
dealer.  They bent over backwards, rolled out red carpets, and treated me
better than I had ever been treated by any other store.  This was a real
win, win situation.  The dealer treated me much better, and probably other
customers as well.

Such a win, win situation could be to your best benefit.  Most business
that deal with people know that customer satisfaction is in their best
interest.  It is also known that business will strive for the best profits.
If they didn't, they would be closing their doors soon after opening.  A
balance must be struck.  Nobody wants to be treated badly, including the
dealer.  In the same circumstances as yours I would be ready to rip off
some one's head!  However, if I were attacked by a customer, my initial
reaction would be one of hostility in kind.  Such a confrontation would
leave both parties with sour grapes.  An attorney has no personal scores to
settle and may get you what you want, and more, without the hostility.  Who
needs the high blood pressure?  You have been through more than enough by
now!

Stevens' suggestion to bring in the PCNA representative may be the
solution.  Your attorney should be made aware of this, and he/she will be
able to apply the correct amount of pressure for the optimum resolution.  I
would be very surprised to see this go to the court room.  I would expect
you will be happy in the end.

Good luck with you trials and tribulations, and please let us know how it
is resolved in the end.
