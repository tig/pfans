Eric: 

What a terrible story.  I would suggest getting in contact with PCNA 
and also finding out who the factory zone manager is (for Texas). I don't think 
the factory representation would like the fact that their dealership 
network is treating owners in this manner. Especially when they are 
clearly responsible on some level. I have seen first hand how factory 
intervention will persuade a dealer to behave differently.  Call an 
attorney in the meantime as well.

Subject: WARNING regarding Dealership and Service Center Towing

I have quite a story for you.   PLEASE question the integrity
of the dealerships and/or service centers you trust your
Porsche with.    Hopefully reading about my experience
will serve as a warning to Porsche owners everywhere.

I got a call on November 21st from the Lipshy Service
Advisor who proceeded to tell me that my car was 
involved in another accident while being towed to the 
body shop. The car actually came off the straps as the 
wrecker turned into the body shop. My Porsche 911
then continued, unattended, through an intersection 
and was broad-sided by a pickup truck going about 
45 mph ! 

But the dealership, Lipshy Motorcars, is completely
shrugging off all responsibility in my opinion!
