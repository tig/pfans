        Read your article on test cars with great interest. It brought to
mind a disappointing occurance I witnessed at this years One Lap of America.

        Porsche has been very successful at the One Lap winning in 94 (Price
Cobb 993) and 95 (David Murry 993-Turbo). For 96 they decided to enter the
same combination of Murry and Turbo. The level of competition had gone up to
the extent that Porsche found themselves running a stock production 3000+
lb. vehicle against limited production (Mosler Intruder) or highly modified
(Lingenfelter Trans Am) machinery. The Intruder is said to have had a
Lingenfelter 550 HP Chevy and weigh less than 2000 lbs. while the T.A. is
reputed to put out in excess of 600 HP. Both were professionally driven by
Tom Reese(Intruder) and Shane Lewis(T.A.)

        None the less, Murry was leading going into Blackhawk Farms on the
3rd day of the event where I watched him finish out of the top 10. When I
questioned him the next day about the poor performance, he said that he had
not driven well. It turned out that the car had been the journalist test
vehicle and had been flogged for over a year. The transmission let go and
Murry had to drive the Blackhawk event without a few gears. During the
night, they swapped the gearbox at a local dealer and David recovered to
finish second to the Intruder by the end of the 7 day event. Perhaps PCNA
under estimated the abuse the car recieved. It was still disappointing to
watch a spectacular performance get marred by an avoidable failure.

        As an aside, I was impressed with David Murry's attempt to disguise
the breakdown by blaming his own driving. This guy is one of the nicest pro
drivers I have ever met. He always finds time to talk with people about
Porsches and heaps compliments on everyone but himself. He is a very gifted
driver and ambassador for Porsche. He indicated that he might get a drive
with the new GT1 in a US series this year. Here's hoping it comes to be as I
am doubtful that Porsche will run a factory entry in the 97 One Lap due the
type of competition. Perhaps they will make a US spec street legal GT1?

        The Mosler Intruder runs with an upside down 930 transmision so
there was some Porsche influence in the wining car.
