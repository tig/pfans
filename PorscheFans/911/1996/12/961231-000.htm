I think you may be right about the ignition switch.

If I turn the switch clock wise 1/4 turn (accessory position?) then
I can alway flash my headlights. If I turn the ignition all the way and
start the car (with the headlight switch off) then I cannot flash my
headlights.

My question now is what should I do?  I took the bezel off the dash and can
see the two hex bolts (not sheared off). That plus the fact that I can
turn my wheel when the car is off means that I don't have a locking
steering wheel. Is that right? Funny that an '86 wouldn't have locking
steering wheel...or is there some trick I don't know?

Looking under the dash I see a large brown electrical connector plugged
into the back of where the key goes. There are several large wires going
into
the connector. There is also a smaller two wire plug plugged next to the
large one. There is a large aluminum extension off the key part that
goes over to the steering wheel area. Does that have something to do
with the locking steering wheel?

****the real question****

How do I take the ignition switch out and what do I do with it after that
to
check for dirty contacts?

Thanks for all your help and for reading this overly long message.
