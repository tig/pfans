>>what does everyone use to clean their windows (inside and out)? ive heard
>>that any product with ammonia is bad for the tint.  is there anything else
>>to be aware of?

On the OUTSIDE windows I use a powdered cleanser named Bon Ami that can be
bought in your grocery store. It removes road film, etc without scratching
the glass <DO NOT use Ajax, Comet or powdered cleansers because they WILL
damage the glass>. I do this as part of washing the car, then use car to
make sure all the residue powder is rinsed off the finish. Then I finish off
the 
in and outsides with an ammonia based cleaner like Windex. It has "always
said" that newspaper is the best product to use (instead of paper towels)
because the inks are mildly abrasive enough to keep from streaking. Old
wives tail?

>There are auto window cleaners available that are Alcohol based, instead

>works well...cuts right through the film and doesn't streak.

I wonder about the long term effects of repeatedly using alcohol products 
with overspray, drips on vinyl dashes, etc.

BTW, Still waiting for my 911 to return from mechanic (rebuild trans and
install B&B full system Twin 4"s) and body shop(new hood as a hit and run
result)

A Happy Porsche-ing New Year to All,
Steve
