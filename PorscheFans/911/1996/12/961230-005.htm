I have a 83 SC with the factory A/C. On the right hand side of the car
the heating
ductwork runs from the lower heat exchanger, through the engine tray,
underneath
the A/C compressor, turns a hard corner, and runs between the A/C 
compressor and the fan shroud and then over to the fan assembly.

Now, the specs call for a 1100 mm belt for the A/C (I think that is what
is is). 

The question is : How the hell do you put the factory stock A/C belt on
without
severly crushing the heating ductwork? The left edge of the A/C
compressor is
quite close to the fan shroud ; there is not way to run a 60mm pice of
flex pipe
in there without some sever denting, which I find weakens the air
ducting and
eventually it just has holes in it.

I can see some solutions:

*	Put the compressor to the right as much as possible, and use a 1200mm
or so belt, The problem with this is that even with the max to the
right, its still a tight squeeze
*	Form a custom piece of sheet metal that provides a flat piece of
ductwork that connects the lower 60mm duct with the upper
*	Freeze (it does get cold at time here in Vancouver)

So, how did the factory do it, and what is the recommended course of
action?

Thanks in advance,

Mike
