Hi, Pfans.  Hope everyone's holidays are going well!

First off, many thanks to those of you that replied to my question about
where to put the CD Changer.  I think I will put mine under the front
passenger seat, since it is both easy to get to, and doesn't require
putting any new holes through the front fire wall.

I must admit that Gary's (Cuoz@aol.com) suggestion of putting the unit
on the passenger's side rear seat was very interesting.  However, I
think that I would like to tie the changer down a bit more solidly...

On another note - I asked once before about a mystery black lead coming
from the power antenna.  Anyway, I got a couple replies about how black
is the universal color for ground, blah blah blah.  Which is fine.  I
should have remembered that from my EE classes.  Now the question is
this:

	Should the ground be tied down inside the car, or in the wheel
	well?  Currently, there is a black lead on the antenna itself,
	which is tied down to the antenna mounting bracket in the wheel
	well.  I think, however, that this area would be highly subject
	to corrosion, and thus would make for a bad ground - and poor
	radio reception.

	I recall seeing somewhere that there were actually a couple of
	manufacturers of power antennas for Porsche - Harada and
	Hirschmann, if I rember correctly.  Does one of these ground in
	the wheel well and one inside the car?

Thanks again!
