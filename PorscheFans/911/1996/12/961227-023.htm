If you have the money right now I'd try to get a 911SC made from '78-'83.
 They are more money upfront, but if you plan to own the car for a
considerable amount of time, you will probably get the money back because the
SC's have a much more reliable engine.  The 2.7 Liter engine is much fussier
to drive than the SC's rock-solid 3.0 and has been known to have problems
(also doesn't last as long).  Not to mention how much faster the 3.0 is.
 Also, I always feel best getting the latest year of a car as I can possibly
afford (as long as the mileage is reasonable.)   The 2.7's ('74-'77) weren't
terrible cars or anything, it's just they take a little more "care" than the
3.0's.  If you have some experience with Porsches and time to spend with
them, a '76 would be fine.  It's still a Porsche 911, which is like nothing
else in the world.  

My 2 cents
