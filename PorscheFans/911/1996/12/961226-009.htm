Richard,

Thanks for the compliments.  I enjoyed writing that story.

I agree that it seems the first run of Boxsters will be inflated.  I would
hope that the initial fever will diminish somewhat as time progresses.  As
for the timing, I think that the production has been staged wisely.
Porsche has been through a lot of changes and has paid its dues dearly with
the previous downturn in sales.  In my opinion, Porsche had quite a bit of
courage to invest in any new offerings in such a short time after that last
drop in U.S.A. sales.  However, it seems pretty clear that they have
delivered a winner onto the streets this go around.  Congratulations
Porsche on your new, very healthy, 2756 pound baby.

I also see that I should drop into the 911 group more often!  Best holiday
wishes to you all.


Marv (1987 944 & 1987 944S)
