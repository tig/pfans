<pre>
have read others' suggestions with reference to mounting location for
radio...cb or otherwise....here's the setup i have had in last two 911
bodystyles.....i remove the ashtray and drill four holes in base...smallest
bit size you have....install four micro bolts and nuts withlock washers and
smaller o rings for rubber vibration  purposes and then drill corresponding
 holes in  top of radio and then mate the two...sounds a little complicated
but radio then sits under ashtray with plenty of shifting room and package
looks like it is oem....mike cord attaches to side of radio and it is out of
way and always handy for use.....mine attaches to a load off  regular antenna
and for all those out on the highway i'm just one of them funny portch
drivers foolishily driving fast not knowing about the radar in the median two
or three miles ahead while i do know about it and will slow down at the
appropiate location.....and normally as soon as they see me the instant
on.... goes on.... but i'm only doing 68.....must drive 'em wild.....use the
same setup in the buick station wagon and i never get the instant on.....in
fact i can drive it almost as fast as it'll go and never draw the
radar......go figure!
