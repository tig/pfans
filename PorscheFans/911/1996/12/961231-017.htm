Hi Bob,

I have a moving stand for my Bandsaw that has a really nice level that
raises it
onto dolly wheels. I may base it on that, or build the frame. What sort
of height is
the frame off the ground? What I would like os some sort of telescopic
frame that
would cradle the engine, and allow you to move it up and down. This
should be easy
using some sort of sliders. I will have to think about it! (thats half
the fun!)

Do you have any qualms about putting the engine weight on the Heat
Exchanges?
I would rather the majority of the weight be on the center rib, and the
supports on 
each heat exchanger is for balance. Of course, I have to crawl under the
car tonight
and take a look. As usual, I am sure the first time will take me some
time, but after
that I will come up with some sort of system.

Do you need to buy any specific parts that are guaranteed to be
sacrificed if you
remove the engine?

Cheers,
