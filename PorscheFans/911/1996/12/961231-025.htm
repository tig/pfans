Terry,

Just a comment on the Raceware Head Studs so their is no confusion...

The Raceware studs as you said do not have the same thermal expansion 
rate as the Dilavar studs. The Raceware head studs are designed to 
provide the proper clamp force in BOTH a cold and hot engine, and have a 
unique metallurgy and design that allows for the proper thermal 
expansion of the engine without over-stressing the head/case.

As your check of the head nuts substantiated, the Raceware head studs 
stay tight eliminating chronic head gasket leaks in the 911 engines no 
matter what year or model.

Happy 1997 to All Porsche Fans !!!

BTW, your oil analysis looks "normal" especially on a rebuild!

Regards,

On the 'Bahn,

Randy, a.k.a. BoltMeister
