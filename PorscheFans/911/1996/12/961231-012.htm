>>Has anyone published or gathered together all the hints about engine
removal/installation? I did see a thread a while ago about engine stands.
 I would like to build a quick stand that cradles the engine from below, and
gives me the ability to lowerand raise the engine in a controller manner,
especially since I do most of the workmyself. 
Any ideas?>>

Mike - Last summer I was faced with the same dilemma. < How to drop a 911
engine w/o much help. > A friend sent me a copy of an article from a VW
magazine on building an engine trolley.  I built one it worked great.  It
slides under the engine on wheels and your hydraulic jack fits between the
supports.  You end up lowering the engine to the trolley, removing the jack
and using it to raise the car.  You place the jack with a plank for
additional support under the rear part of the body pan just fwd of the tranny
to raise it.  I think Dave Cooley described this recently.

The trolley is simply two pieces of 4X4s about 24 inches long parallel to
each other and held together by an 18 - 24in (you’ll have to measure) piece
of 4 in channel iron under the front edges.  I used some three inch wood
bolts to hold the iron.  I put 4 in swivel wheels under all four corners.
 The 4X4’s end up supporting the engine under the heat exchangers.  The "U"
shape allows you to withdraw the jack once the engine is down on the trolley.
 The wheels allow you move the engine around. Real Cool.

I was able to remove and install my 911T engine with my SO providing a little
additional assistance (minimal)

The first time I removed my engine, another friend came over and we did it
the traditional way.  Raise the car WAY up, and lower the engine down with a
jack. This puts the engine in a precarious position both coming out and going
back in.  I like my way better.

Hope this helps
