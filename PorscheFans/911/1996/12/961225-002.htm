Hello and Merry Christmas, 

Just wanted to let everyone know that I am selling my 71 T Targa.  The car
is red with black.  I have recently (1,500 miles) had the engine totally
rebuilt.  Updated to E pistons, updated chain tensioners, and valve covers.
(The engine was rebuilt by a well respected racing shop, and the bill was
around $8,000.)  The car has 4 new calipers, new master cylinder, fuel pump,
fuel tank has been boiled and resealed, the Zenith carbs have been rebuilt
and run exceptionally well.  I have put in new carpet and have sorted out
all of the electricals.  Shortly after paying for the engine rebuild, I
learned my first lesson about battery acid damage.  The suspension pan needs
to be replaced.  The car is still drivable and I do have all necessary parts
for the pan replacement.  Due to space and financial reasons I MUST SELL
THIS CAR!!!  My father and I have invested over $18,000 on this car since
1986.  I have priced the car at $7,500 for a quick sale.  Please email me at
CColaluca@Mindspring.com if you have any questions.  Or call me at work at
864-627-9000.  This car is the most solid example of an early 911 that my
mechanic has seen.  The floorboards, etc. are absolutely rust free.  The car
is located in uperstate South Carolina.

Thanks and sorry for the bandwidth for those who aren't interested,

Craig
