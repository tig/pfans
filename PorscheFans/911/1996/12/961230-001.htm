Steven:

Torque specs for high-torque fasteners in tension assemblies are
invariably written under the assumption that the fasteners WILL be
lubricated; if a spec says 94 ft-lbs and doesn't explicitly say that
this measurement should be taken with dry threads, you MUST
lubricate the threads.

By the way, the Porsche wheel-nut spec (94 ft-lbs) DEFINITELY
assumes the use of anti-seize; whoever recommended torquing to a
lower value was wrong.

Besides, anti-seize is NECESSARY whenever you're dealing with
dissimilar metals (in the example you gave, either alloy nuts on
steel studs or steel nuts tightened directly against alloy wheels). 

Ok...

The deal with threaded fasteners in tension (as opposed to
assemblies where the fasteners are used in double-shear, or as axles,
with locknuts or whatever) is that they can ONLY work if the bolt
stretches... The more they stretch, the more preload (tension) they
generate.

The most accurate way to measure the tension across a bolt is by 
measuring its installed length; unfortunately, it's not practical for 
most fasteners to be measured this way, so torque specs are used 
instead.

Now... Most people assume that the relationship between torque and
preload is more-or-less linear (at least, up to the point at which
the bolt fails).  Except in the case of an assembly coated with a
VERY slippery lubricant, however, this is not true.

When you tighten a dry (unlubricated) bolt, much of the torque
you're applying goes toward overcoming friction between the male and
female threads -- remember, the bolt's stretching -- and between the
underside of the bolt head and the washer against which you're
tightening it.

As the bolt is tightened, the percentage of the torque required to
overcome this friction grows exponentially... At some point, in
fact, the bolt will STOP TURNING; once the threads stop making
forward progress, the bolt stops stretching and no more preload will
be generated.  If you continue to add more torque beyond this
friction-bound limit, the head of the bolt will just twist off and
you'll have to ask Pete Albrecht to explain EDM again.

With a lubricated bolt, the point at which the fastener becomes
friction-bound and stops turning will be VERY high up the
torque-vs-preload curve... Ideally, it'll be ABOVE the point at which
the bolt fails (that is, it will NEVER occur; the bolt will be
capable of being tightened until it simply snaps).

With a dry bolt, on the other hand, the friction-bound point is
likely to be very low on the curve; attempts to generate high levels
of tension across that dry bolt will be futile, since it just won't
turn far enough to stretch sufficiently.

Even if you don't reach the point at which the bolt stops turning,
you're still in trouble if you apply lubruicated-bolt torque specs to
dry bolts.  Because the torque-vs-preload curve for dry bolts levels
off very rapidly, you may discover (or worse, may NOT discover until
it's too late) that the tension you're generating across the bolt is
SIGNIFICANTLY lower than what you want.  Even at moderate torque
values, the difference between dry-bolt tension and lubed-bolt
tension can be 50% OR MORE.

You can find more information from any of the fastener manufacturers
who know what they're doing -- Unbrako has a LOT of good literature,
for instance -- or you can read Carroll Smith's "Engineer To Win" or
"Nuts, Bolts, and Fasteners Handbook" (aka "Screw To Win").

If you have a copy of "Engineer To Win", turn to page 138 and take a
look at the graph in Figure 143.

The graph shows Installation Torque versus Pre-Load for a
cadmium-plated bolt (3/8-24 MS 20006) under three conditions:
Lubricated with graphite in petroleum jelly, lubricated with engine
oil, and dry.

The differences are HUGE... At 17 foot-pounds of torque, the dry bolt
achieves only 2400 pounds of preload, while the graphite-in-vaseline
bolt generates about 5500 pounds -- over TWICE the preload.

At higher torque settings, the differences are even larger due to the
higher-than-linear increase in friction between the underside of the
bolt and the washer, and between the male and female mating threads: 
At 50 foot-pounds of torque, the dry bolt generates only 7800 pounds
of preload while the lubricated bolt makes over 19,000.

Additionally, the chart indicates that the dry bolt has an ultimate
friction-bound preload limit of somewhat less than 15,000 pounds,
while the lubricated bolt looks good up to its yield strength (which
I'd guess is 100,000 pounds or so).

The bolt in this example would probably be used in an application
requiring 60-90,000 pounds of preload; if the bolt was installed with
no lubrication, the absolute MAXIMUM achievable preload will only be
16-25% of the desired value... Not good, especially if you're using 
that bolt to hold some essential piece to your car.

P.S.  Randy Hubbard, aka BoltMeister, will probably have something
      to say on this subject, as well.  Listen to him... He's an
      expert. 

P.P.S.  I'm copying this to the "General" list, since it has 
        applicability beyond 911s.
