Hey,

Jeffrey Gooden's advice was good - getting as new a car as you can is
a good idea.  I happen to own a '76, though, and it has been a great
car.  The only engine related problems I have had in 3 and a half years
of ownership (which about a tenth of my mileage on the car being track
miles) is replacement of the warm up regulator and the fuel accumulator.

I think when you are looking at 911s this old, you have to judge each car
on its own merits.  You can't make blanket statements like, "all SCs are
better than the 2.7s".  I think buying a 2.7 liter 911 is just fine as long
as you know what you're getting yourself into.  Try to determine the
condition of the engine as well as you can.  Everything else on the car
is pretty standard 911 fare.  In fact, other than the engine (and the flares),
there's not a big difference between a '76 911 and an SC.

Good luck,
