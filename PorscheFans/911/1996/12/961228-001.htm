John inquired about a whining noise if 5th gear of his trasmission.

When I bought my 911 (with 915 transmission) it had a whine in 5th and 
3rd.  The car had sat in a barn (yes a real barn with hay and 
everything) for over 10 years.  I took it in and they found that 5th had 
rusted a little from sitting without oil on it.  They rebuilt the 
transmission - replacing 5th and finding nothing wrong with third gear.  
To this day third still has a slight whine.  I have brought it to more 
than one Porsche expert on to listen to it.  They almost all said the same 
thing:  Porsche gear boxes make noises.  One mechanic even told me that 
there is a Porsche Service Bulliten confirming the same thing.  I guess 
this is sort of like 'an English car that doesn't leak oil has something 
wrong with it.'
