FWIW,

On many of the earlier C-2/4 cars stray electrical signals from the 
ignition cables have been known to false trigger numerous warning 
sensors. With cold weather the demand on the ignition system increases 
at start-up and could be the reason for recent problems. Porsche's fix 
for the EMI radiation is to install electrical insulating sleeve over 
the ignition cables...
