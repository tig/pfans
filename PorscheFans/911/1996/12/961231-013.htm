Juha Vane <103446.3446@CompuServe.COM> asked :

>> I'm starting from the easy end and the first thing on my list is to change
the
shocks
front and rear. While doing that I was planning to change the 24,1mm rear
torsion bars 
to original 26,0mm turbo bars and change brake rotors. 
  
3. Rear torsion bars
    Was also planning to change the rear 24,1mm torsion bars to turbo 26,0mm
torsion bars.
    Otherwise the suspension is stock, have replaced all worn rubber with
original parts, 
    new spring plates, banana arm bushings and all sway bar mounts, front
A-arm 
    rubbers was good.
    - Is this change recommended?
    - Should I change something else, what? >>

You are changing the over/understeer balance a LOT by using
26 mm rear bars with stock 19mm front bars. I would recommend
using tires and wheels on the rear that are MUCH wider than the
front, like 205s on the front (6 or 7" rims) and 245 or more on the 
rear on 9" rims.

Also you will need an adjustable sway bar on one end at least to
really tune it. An adjustable rear is easier on the late model (post '73
is late model???) 911s.

As for shock adjustment, start with the rears near full soft
to help the rear balance with the big bars. You can tighten
them later if needed (or for wear which they will).

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!
