Comments on 1 and 2 
86 911 coupe

1. Having bought an 86 911 this year that had been lowered and raised and
generally had the suspension really screwed up, I can attest to just how
badly bump steer affects the car. Bump steer is absolutely horrible. Horrible
ride. Horrible handling. My car had been lowered and the spacers added, then
raised back up without removing the spacers. It took several tries at
adjusting the front ride height to get all back in line.  The ride height
adjustment is easy to do on the front,  but takes time to get right.  (So
what else is new). After all the adjustments, an alignment is absolutely
necessary  

2.  I added the same Konis and mine are now on setting 1 of 0,1,2,3.  Yes, it
is a hassle to change these, and I can tell the difference even with the
normal everyday slow street driving I have done so far.  I'm sure that these
differences have a much greater impact at higher speeds and harder driving. I
have gotten quite good and quick at removing and adjusting these.  I make use
of a nylon strap that was previously used in woodworking. Nylon strap is
about 2" wide with a ratchet assy for tightening.  Compress the shock, slip
on the strap, install shock, then slip off the strap.

Expect lots of time and trials to get these where you like them for your
driving. Not only is the difference between the men and boys the price of our
toys, but also the amount of time we can play with them.
