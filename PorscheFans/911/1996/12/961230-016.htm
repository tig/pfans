Wanted to take a minute to thank those of you who responded to my request for
guidance and experiences with improving the ability to heel-n-toe in a '77
911.  I'm not sure which other models would have the same set-up, but I'm
guessing the 911 SC's and possibly the Carreras.

I thought I'd summarize the info. sent to me and add my resolution.  Keep in
mind that the following applies only to 911's w/ power assist brakes.

I learned that there are a variety of techniques being used out there by
Porsche drivers.  Heel-n-toe, toe-n-heel (referring to what's on the brake
and what's on the gas), and a what I'll call a split foot, where the ball of
the foot is on the brake, and the pad of the foot (near the little toe area)
is on the gas.  I use the split foot technique, so my solution fits that
technique, but minor adjustments would serve the other techniques as well, I
suppose.

The brake pedal can be adjusted significantly, probably as much as an inch or
more, with the turnbuckle arrangement of the rod connecting the brake pedal
to the master cylinder.  This is easily accessible at the pedal assembly
area.  The caution here is that you don't want to adjust too much of the
travel out of the pedal.  I was cautioned by many to remenber that the
"bottoming out" point of the pedal moves down as the brake fluid boils under
heavy braking conditions (track use for the most part).

Two different things can be done w/ the accelerator pedal - four if you count
the Wing Pedal product.  Costs $99 and is an aluminum plate which can be
bolted directly to the accelerator.  I had two positive responses and two
negative responses on this product, so the jury's split.  The cheap
alternatives include:

 1)  making an "extension" out of wood or metal, and fastening to the
existing accelerator pedal.  You'll notice, when you remove the pedal, which
you MUST do, that it has cast areas in the back which can be easily drilled
out to accept screws which can be used to fasten the "extension".  This can
be cut to whatever thickness you require for your technique.  I used a piece
of 3/4" oak, left over from a recent hardwood floor we had installed.  If cut
a bit wider than the existing pedal, it'll close up the gap bwtween the brake
and gas, and makes the split foot technique a snap!  The object is to have
the gas and brake near each other and on the same horizontal plane while
braking.  If you're of the heel-n-toe technique, just cut the bottom of the
pedal 1 1/2 or 2 inches wider, and you've got the perfect spot to heel in a
blip of the throttle.  The beauty of this device is that the accelerator stop
isn't affected.

2)  There is approximately 1/2" of adjustment on the accelerator pedal
linkage, which "pops" into the back of the pedal.  If you go this route, you
must then adjust the pedal stop out the same amount, or you'll strain or
worse, you'll bend the linkage at the engine regardless of fuel delivery
system, and could get stuck at full throttle.  (Usually a VERY undesirable
situation).

Thanks to all who took the time to respond.  I thought this summary may help
some others, and ultimately, conserve some bandwidth.
