Pfans:
In the past there has been some discussion regarding oil samples and I   
thought I'd pass on the results I got back from Titan on the first sample   
taken after my rebuild.  I'll skip the details but this is a 2.7 on it's   
second overhaul.  The first being somewhere in the dim PO past.  Lots of   
machine work, new valves, rings, bearings, guides and such.  Also did   
Timesert inserts and Raceware studs, external cooler and SSI heat   
exchangers.  If anybody new on the list wants the details let me know   
separately and I can email you the overhaul summary I've posted in the   
past.  BTW having seen some recent comments regarding 2.7 engines it is   
my understanding that Raceware studs don't expand with engine heat like   
Divlar.  I put Raceware studs and Timesert inserts on both intake and   
exhaust and found them all at torque spec. after 10 hrs of run in.  With   
the external cooler I have yet to see oil temps in excess of 190 but   
thats in summer traffic and not the track.
The oil was Castrol GTX straight 30 wt.  Total run time 10 hrs.  Wear   
Metal, PPM.
Chromium 0
Copper 10
Iron 24
Lead 10
Tin 2
Aluminum 2
Silicon (Dirt) 45
The last is abnormal but could be caused by either outside contamination   
to the sample or residual dirt after the machine work.
Thanks again to the list member that turned us on to Titan.  Nice folks   
and good info for short money.
