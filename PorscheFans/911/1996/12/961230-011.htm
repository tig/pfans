Hi all,

Back on the list, was once again bumped, perhaps my mailbox got full
when I was travelling and CompuServe didn't accept more mail. 
I'm here far up north, in Finland, -10C outside so it's perfect time to do
something 
in the garage. I have an -85 911 with high miles, so all kind of things need
attention.
I'm not much as a driver, but regardless of that, it's so fun. Now during the
winter I 
work on the car, that is at least to me fun also.

I'm starting from the easy end and the first thing on my list is to change the
shocks
front and rear. While doing that I was planning to change the 24,1mm rear
torsion bars 
to original 26,0mm turbo bars and change brake rotors. Rebuilt the whole brake
system earlier.

I would appreciate advice from the list on couple things:

1. Bump steer
    Bruce A. write about this in his excellent book "911 Performance handbook"
quote,
    "This is an extensive procedure, but it is a must..."
    - Have I understood right that when the car is loaded, fuel, spare etc., the

      tie-rods should be horizontal? This seem so logical and hence I have my
doubts 
      that I miss something here?
    - Seen the "bump steer kits" that is a couple of thick washers and longer
bolts,
      is this the cure?
  
2. Shocks
    Bought yellow Koni sport shocks front & rear and are now wondering;
    Fronts are externally adjustable, so here I can do the old trial & error
method,
    but the rears need to be removed for adjustment.
    - Where do I initially start, softest position?
    In my Audi shop manual they recommended that the space between strut and
    shock cartridge should be filled partially with antifreeze for heat
transfer.
    - How about this in Porsche?

3. Rear torsion bars
    Was also planning to change the rear 24,1mm torsion bars to turbo 26,0mm
torsion bars.
    Otherwise the suspension is stock, have replaced all worn rubber with
original parts, 
    new spring plates, banana arm bushings and all sway bar mounts, front A-arm 
    rubbers was good.
    - Is this change recommended?
    - Should I change something else, what?

4. Brake rotors
    Bought new rotors and are wondering if I should gas slot them, was told that
it is not
    necessary, but cross drilled & gas slotted disks are available.
    - Should I gas slot them? I have access to a mill
    - How deep?
    - How many slots? I was thinking about three slots tangential over disk
surface, so this
      would come to 6 slots on one side of disk.

I have a relatively demanding job, but Ill try to do these things soon so I can
have a look inside 
my transmission to see why the gears are so difficult to engage. Suspecting
sync. rings. 
This can be read as, more questions coming. 

TIA
