Personally, I would avoid the 2.7 liter 911s ('74 - '77).  The engines were
not
known for durability; expect major repairs at about 50-75,000 miles.  This
was the last vintage of the magnesium engine cases, and they couldn't take
the stress of a 2.7 liter.  Had major problems with studs pulling out of the 
case, engine overheating (poor oil cooling), plus this was last vintage 911
with equal tires front and rear; they are more prone to oversteer than later 
cars.  The CIS injection can be problematic, especially with today's fuels.  
Also, distributor points were major problem (couldn't handle engine heat);
needed frequent adjustment.

Recommend holding out for at least the 911SC, and preferably the Carrera.

I had a '76 911S which had a complete engine rebuild at about 90,000 miles;
was leaking and burning oil badly.  Studs were replaced, got new pistons/
cylinders, camshafts replaced (pitted, even with oil/filter changed at 
6000 miles).  By 125,000 miles, oil leaks had recommenced and oil 
consumption was increasing.

Later had a '84 Carrera; when engine was apart at 125,000 miles (frozen /
snapped spark plug!!!), oil seals/guide wear were just within tolerance,
bottom
end was fine.  This got same maintenance as '76, but better engine case
(aluminum), oil cooling, and fuel injection really made a difference.

One good thing I found on the '76 was the A/C; dealer installed underdash
unit was far superior to "integrated" factory one in my '84!.

From: "lyle bruce" <lbruce>

I'm looking at a 76 911.  I'm also learning as I go.  Can anybody tell me
if this is a good or bad year.  Plusses or minuses etc. Other than the
air conditioning it seems the only things wrong are minor cosmetics.
Thanks for the help.
