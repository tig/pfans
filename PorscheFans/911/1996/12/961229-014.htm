i quote from an article in performance car, march 1989, the porsche
engineer friedrich bezner.  don't know if it would answer your
questions or not, but it is intersting nevertheless:

he is actually talking about why they DID NOT use viscous couplings
in the 964...

"we experimented with visco couplings.  to control the center
differential you can do various things; use a viscous coupling, fit a
plain clutch which simply locks or unlocks the diff, or you can use a
variable torque clutch.  there are two weaknesses of the visco
coupling; first the inability to control it, and second its torque
delivery characteristic.  when you turn one side of a VC relative to
the other, the torque transmitted begins gently, then rises
exponentially in a more or less fixed way.  the inability to dictate
when a VC acts would not allow our lift off oversteer control; we also
need to switch out the both differential clutch brakes during
anti-lock braking."

"the exponential torque characteristic is not at all ideal for control
- we need a straight line characteristic, which can be applied rapidly
or delicately as needed.  for example, in the case of the rear axle
differential, if one wheel starts to slip, a VC would not stiffen
sufficiently without a larger speed difference between left and right
rear wheels than we need."

[then as an aside...]

"once our system has set itself up with what are in effect
measurements of the rolling radii of each tire (it does this in the
first few meters of level, steady speed driving - sensed by the
accelerometers and wheel sensors - after each start from rest) it is
capable, whilst taking account of wheel speed differences while
cornering, of sensing wheel rotation rates differences down to 0.8kph
(0.5mph) due to slip; this is smaller than the difference in wheel
rotation rates between a new and a worn tire of the same size."


it would seem to me that this is the "idiosyncracy" that you guys are
experiencing.  actually it sounds really high tech once one finds out
what is really going on.  with different tire sizes and wear rates
between front and rear, it probably is taking its time getting
calibrated.

the first two paragraphs are ironic because viscous couplings are
exactly what the 993 C4 & turbo uses!  but then they fixed the
sting in the tail first rather than try to use 4wd to cure it.
