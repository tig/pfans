I had hard shifting with my 944, but it was not the transaxle, rather the
pilot bearing at the end of the crankshaft (cost $10.00).  It required me
to pull the clutch on the car, but was otherwise an easy job.  The symptoms
was I could not engage first, or second gear at a dead stop without first
selecting third gear with the clutch in then selecting first.  Also made
for some hard shifting when moving.

If your car shifts OK at a dead stop, I would expect the syncros are faulty.
