Hi,

What I tell all my friends and customers if they ever have to look at a
used Porsche for the reason of Purchase, allways remove the Speedometer
this can be a sure sign of tampering.

1st.  Porsche always stamps most of there parts with month and year of     
   manufacturing
        all speedos have the stamping.
        If the car is on line then the owner should have documentation of
when the                 actual speedo was replaced and the record of what
mileage was on the other                 speedo at replacement time.

2nd.  When people tamper with speedos ie. turn back the clock, it is
virtually                              impossible to have all the numbers
line up again. The reason I know is I have                   repaired a
few.

3rd.   On some Porsches, the date of manufacture of the vehicle and the
date on the                   speedo could be out as much as 6-12 months
only due to the way Porsche           stock there parts. This is completely
normal

I hope this will help some of you the next time you Purchase that great buy
a Porsche

Regards to all and a prosperous New year.


Jay.
