Upgrading to the latest oil-fed tensioners is one of the best things you
can do for your engine, and if you can tell the difference between a
wrench and a screwdriver, you can do it yourself - it's a piece of cake.
A good time to do this is at oil change time, otherwise you'll need to
drain the engine - the timing chest covers contain oil. Sometimes the
bolts holding the tin-work can seize, causing them to shear - no
problem, as you'll be junking the original timing chest covers anyway.
(This is another good reason for using anti-seize compound when
re-assembling.) The hear-say about this being a hard job probably
started from dealers who need the work. The only other minor job to do
when you've finished is to cut a small slot in the right-hand tin-work
to clear the oil line to the tensioner.
 
Why do this job? It's pre-emptive of a tensioner letting go 100 miles
from home in the middle of nowhere, and causing untold engine damage
when the timing chains jump a sprocket as a consequence.
