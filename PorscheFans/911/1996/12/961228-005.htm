What a sad story.  I hope that you don't cave in to the pressure to give in
to whatever the dealer tells you you should be doing.  I would raise the
biggest stink possible, including talking to a newspaper, the local TV news,
as well as taking them to court for whatever damage you can think of.  The
only way that this kind of mistreatment is going to stop is if the people
who are damaged step up to the plate and take a swing at them with the
biggest bat they can find.  A bit of bad press can do wonders for someone,
ESPECIALLY since this isn't your local Chevy dealer where the people
probably don't watch the news anyway.  There is a very limited number of
people who are going to want to take their Porsche to a dealer that is
clearly taking advantage of and bullying its customers.  Spread the word to
the local PCA, as well as PCNA with a detailed account as well.  I can't
imaging that PCNA would just stand by and watch...maybe I'm wrong.  Please,
please do something more than just stew over this, it is worth more than that.

let us all know what else happens as the saga continues.
