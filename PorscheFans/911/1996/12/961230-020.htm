In BMW Digest #764, J. G. Shepard forwarded a story from the Porsche 911
mailing list, which I in turn forwarded to a friend of mine (former 911
owner living in Austin, TX).  He had some great advice so I thought I would
share it with the list.  Following is his response:

-----
G,

Are either chawk@juno.com or Eric.Henneke@OAG.STATE.TX.US the guy who
experienced this?  I would guess that it's Eric Henneke.  I would like to
send him an e-mail response with a few suggestions.  First of all, he
should contact the Austin chapter of the better business bureau and file a
formal complaint--lots of people check with the BBB prior to making a major
purchase.  

Secondly, he should contact Porsche America--these are the people
responsible for awarding and regularing franchiseships to dealers like
Lipshy.  Eric (or whoever) should formally write to Porsche America
requesting that the incident be reviewed, and pending the results, the
franchiseship revoked from Lipshy.  Eric should also request that he be
kept informed of all actions taken by Porsche America regarding this incident.

Porsche has a vested interest in keeping its customers happy.  This
especially includes the dealership experience--this is the direct line of
contact for all new sales.  Perspective new buyer's don't call the factory
in Germany to discuss a new purchase.  The only way for Porsche to sell
cars is through these dealerships.  This kind of customer mistreatment
should set off all kinds of alarms at Porsche.  Lipshy is effectively
representing Porsche in all customer dealings--I don't think Porsche will
be very happy with how they've been represented by Lipshy in this case.

Third--Eric (or whoever) should contact a lawyer (without telling Lipshy)
to determine what rights he has--until the lawyer contacts Lipshy, the
dealership has no way of knowing whether or not he has gone to a laywer.
If the lawyer feals that Eric has a strong case, then they can contact
Lipshy.  If the lawyer doesn't feel Eric has strong case, no harm done
(since Lipshy doesn't know about it).

Wow.  I'm angry, and this didn't even happen to me.

Chris
