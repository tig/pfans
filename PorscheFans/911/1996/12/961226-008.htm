 I recently purchased a '89 C4 with about 90K miles.  When cold, I often get
a
 warning light, and sometimes the warning chimes for the transaxle.  This
 usually goes away when the car starts to move forward, but sometimes I get
 the warning chime at start-up which goes away as soon as I start to drive,
 along with the warning indication.  Twice in one month the warning light and
 chime have come on while driving (no unusual conditions).  As soon as I turn
 the engine off and re-start it goes away.  Anybody have a clue?  The trans.
 seems to work OK. It locks and unlocks OK and nothing seems to be wrong.
 I will verify a previous post about clutch slippage.  I one time tried a
very
 spirited launch, and the clutch slipped big time, with a big stink.  It
seems
 fine, but I will never do it again!
 Any info. on this model car would be deeply appeciated, as I am a novice.
 Thanks,
 Tad >>

I have an '89 C-4 that displays the same behavior.  My understanding from a
very knowledgeable mechanic is that these lights are supposed to come on for
the first few seconds to minutes as a vacuum builds.  I have noticed that as
time has gone on, these lights stay on a bit longer.  Just about every C-4
owner I've talked to has noted the same idiosyncracy.

Regards,

Harry Brandt, M.D.
