I adjusted my valves yesterday - for the first time. Couple of questions. 
In order to get the feeler gauge in I had to loosen most of the valves. I 
guess that means most were tight. Do they typically loosen over time or 
tighten over time? The valves are a little noiser than they were before. 
I wish I could have another car to compare it to. Runs fine -- feels a 
little faster - possibly they were too tight and the valves were not closing 
completely? Comments?

Thanks
