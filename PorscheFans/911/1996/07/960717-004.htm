	I *always* park my car in gear, whether it's on a slope or not. On a
slope (using 1st or Reverse, depending on which way I'm parked), it
provides extra insurance against the handbrake cable snapping. On the
level, I can't think of any reason *not* to do so, and it may help prevent
the car from moving too far if it is ever hit by another car.

	The original poster had a faulty gearbox, which should be fixed, but 
(especially as his driveway, like mine, is on a slight slope) he should not 
be discouraged from parking in gear. Unless anyone wants to convince me 
otherwise ...

regards,
