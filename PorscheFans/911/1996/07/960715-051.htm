Thomas:

At least on the newer Tiptronic cars (don't know for sure about your
'91), the Tiptronic "brain" tries to deduce your driving style from
the driver inputs (throttle-position behavior, etc.).  It chooses
one of half-a-dozen-or-so shift patterns (from "This guy drives to
work wearing a crash helmet -- He must be a POC member" to "This guy
drives like a little old lady -- Let's not scare him by allowing the 
engine to rev above 4000 RPM").

After holding more-or-less constant throttle for "several hours", 
it's not surprising that the Tiptronic brain would switch to a "mild" 
shift-pattern.

I've heard that there's a way to override the automatic
pattern-selection (something like blipping the throttle a couple
times within a minute of starting the car -- I forget, exactly)...
Maybe someone else on the list knows the details.
