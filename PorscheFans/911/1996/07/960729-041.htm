Hi John,


What most people consider to be "Euro Spec" is actually lower than the true
European specifications. The correct ride height will result in a measurement
of about 25" when measured from the ground to the rear fender lip. The 911
should have a very slight nose down attitude, (approximately 1 degree slope)
which will result in a measurement about one half inch higher at the front
fender lip than at the rear (about 25 1/2 inches). There is a more
sophisticated procedure for measuring the cars ride height given in the
procedure in the workshop manual which relates the center line of the torsion
bars front and rear to the center line of their respective axle. 

Measure up from ground to center line of axle and measure up from ground to
center line of torsion bar front and rear. The difference should be:
Front = 108 mm +/- 5 mm (center line of wheel above torsion bar center line)
[maximum difference between left and right 5 mm]
Rear = 12 mm +/- 5 mm (center line of torsion bar above center line of wheel)
[maximum difference between left and right 8 mm]

FRONT SUSPENSION
Camber: 0 degrees negative +/- 10 minutes (maximum difference between left
and right 10')
Caster: 6 degrees 5 minutes +/- 15 minutes left and right (Maximum caster
difference between left and right 30')
Toe-in: +15 minutes x 5 minutes (not pressed) new method
Toe-in: 0x (wheels pressed) 

REAR SUSPENSION
Camber: 1 degree negative +/- 10 minutes (maximum difference between left and
right 20')
Toe-in: +10 minutes +/- 10 minutes.(maximum difference between left and right
20')

For a compromise street and competition setting increase the negative camber
setting front and rear by one to one and a half degrees. 

1x change in spring strut inclination = approximately 7 to 9 mm change in car
height.

Adjusting rear torsion bars

Old Version 44/40 teeth.
Torsion bar adjusted 1 inside tooth up and the swing arm one tooth down
produces a swing arm change of approximately 50' and a vehicle height change
of approximately 6.5 mm.
If the torsion bar is turned one tooth on the inside the adjustment is equal
to 9x
If the spring strut is turned one tooth the adjustment is equal to 8x10'

New Version 47/46 teeth (1987-89 and 1989 Turbo)
Torsion bar adjusted 1 inside tooth up and the swing arm one tooth down
produces a swing arm change of approximately 10' and a vehicle height change
of approximately 1.4 mm.

If the torsion bar is turned one tooth on the inside the adjustment is equal
to 7x50'
If the spring strut is turned one tooth the adjustment is equal to 7x14'
