Returning home on Sunday after an autox, I was driving along Rt 78 in NJ with 
a 300ZX following closely.  I had the top off, blasting along at 80-90 when 
suddenly "WHOOOSH!".  My loose and torn front rubber bumper trim was ripped 
off by the wind and went flying over my head into the bushes narrowly missing 
the 300zx.  He was no longer interested in keeping up with the old 911.  
Ha Ha!  I can still see the surprised look on his face.  Anyways, I've got to 
get around to installing the new rubber strip I've had sitting at home for the
last year. 
 I've tried this before and gave up because I could not get the plastic strip 
to slide into the 2 channels of the tight new rubber.  Is there a 
rubber-friendly solvent (glycerine??) which will aid installation? Any other 
tricks?

TIA,
