I did not think one could really mix any part of the A/C
which had been exposed to R-12 to R-134a.  If you did
the PAG oil of the 134 would turn to jelly, and your
compressor would soon die.  There is considerable desire
to do this, as the potential market is large, but
as of today, I thought 2 year lifespans, were, ahm,
overstated?
