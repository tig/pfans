Hey,

Well, that post seemed to stir up some opinions.  I had never heard
the "equal restraints" requirement voiced, or even seen it in print.

It does make sense, of course.  The cost of an extra harness isn't a
big deal - the cost of two seats is.  I guess my current plan is to try
to put a cage in my car, get another 5-point harness and leave the
stock seats in.  The only drawback is that stock seats aren't permitted
in Club Racing unless thay are modified to allow the belts to pass
through the seat (if anyone can tell me otherwise, I would appreciate
it).

I appreciate the rational discussion of this subject.  I never intended
to imply that I had was trying to circumvent the rules - I just didn't know
what the rules were.

Thanks,

Mike Dayton
