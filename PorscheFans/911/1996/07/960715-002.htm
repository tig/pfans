	...is something we all love so here's mine:


About three months ago, I noticed my car was running "a little warm". The 
car is an 87 944, 99K miles, and very well maintained. "A little warm" is 
defined as when idling the temp. needle is level with the horizon (that 
is, a bit above the the first mark) and when under load (70 mph with ac 
on, 3000 rpms) the needle goes all the way to the second mark. On really hot 
days (110 degrees), the needle can creep up to just above the second mark but 
it never gets as high as the red and the warning lights never come on. 
Cruising down the highway, stop and go from red lights, etc. causes it to 
heat up but you can leave it idling in the hot sun and the gauge will register
just above the first mark, never higher. Hmm. So it is only heating up at 
speed. This seems odd to me. I check the fans and they're cycling okay. Hmm. 
So I put it in the shop. I'd wanted a low temp. thermostat/fan switch combo 
for awhile so they go ahead and do that. It doesn't seem to help. They check 
the radiator for leaks and blockage. Nope, the coolant is circulating fine. 
They check the water pump. It's okay, too. Oil cooler is fine and there's no 
water in the oil/oil in the water (thank god). We decide I could have a blown 
head gasket which is letting some of the exhaust gas heat up the engine 
coolant coolant (even though I haven't had to put any water in it). They 
do a leakdown test. The results are less than 2% on 
each cylinder so the engine seems fine (great, in fact). Bottom line; we 
can't figure it out. We have two theories;

	1)There is a very, very tiny leak in my head gasket. So small
	it doesn't show on the leakdown yet large enough to let some heat
	escape into the cooling system.

	2)The impellor in my water pump is beginning to go a bit and is
	slipping now and then at higher rpms (3000 or so) which is causing
	the coolant to heat up some.


They gave me the car back and I've been driving it. The new thermo/fan 
switch seems to have helped some but it is definitely still "a little warm".
My plan now is to drive the thing til the problem gets more pronounced 
and then try to diagnose it again. My shop says they've never seen a 944 
do this and there was nothing in the tech bulletins from Porsche about 
this problem. Anyone else ever have something like this happen? Anyone 
have any ideas about what it could be?
