Hi Steve,

 We used to have our customers who bought Swepco buy some Staylube gear lube,
because it came with a pump. You could then put the Staylube gear lube aside
and use their pump for the Swepco. As I recall it was a little bellows guy
that you could pump with your foot. 

Another friend made a pump device out of an old pressure cooker. He put a
hose fitting and hose at the bottom and then put a air line pressure fitting
on the lid. He would put just enough trans lube in the pressure cooker and
then stick the hose into his transmission and then hook up his air hose at a
reduced pressure. The air pressure would blow all of the gear lube out of the
pressure cooker and into the transmission.
