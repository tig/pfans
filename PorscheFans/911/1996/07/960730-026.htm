Does anyone have any experience with 911 oil pumps? (If you have it
probably is a bad experience). On the way home from work last Friday I
noticed smoke coming from the engine compartment. When I stopped to look,
the top of the engine, and the compartment were covered with fresh oil.
Towed to my mechanic who surmised that the oil pressure release valve gave
way because of too much oil in the case. Today, after thorough testing, he
tells me that there is no oil pressure whatsoever, and that the secondary
pump has broken. Since these are never supposed to break, Porsche put them
inside the engine, and it requires a complete teardown to get to it. Total
cost could be as high as $7500. 
Any opinions as to whether it is worth the trouble? Or, should I just
keep an eye out for a serviceable engine and replace the one I have? Or,
just sell the car by parts?
