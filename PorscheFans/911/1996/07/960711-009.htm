When that happened to me, I found out that the rear sway bar mount had
broken loose (they are notorious for that). There is an upgrade part
available from Automotion and probably from others.

Hi All,
..
I recently noticed a metallic clinking noise coming from the
right rear wheel area on my '85 911. It sounds kind of like a
loose washer bouncing around. I first started hearing it
going over large bumps, but now I also hear it going over
small bumps. I jacked up the rear end and looked around
but couldn't find anything loose. I did notice the sound
when I was jacking the car up, but I can't pinpoint where
its coming from. My next step is to remove the rear wheel
to see if anything is loose around the brake caliper. In the
meantime, does anyone have any ideas what could be making
this sound?
..
Thanks,
..
