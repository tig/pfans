Bart,

Please calm down. If you really wanted to assume the worst, you might
be able to make a case that Sean suggested something "fishy" happened
to the money. But there is nothing that impugns you directly or implicitly.

And, if you accepted the "fishy" theory, it would likely be Stan Hanks
that is impugned by the statement, not you. Your name is not mentioned
anywhere.

Based on the fact that Stan sent out a note saying the money was going to
be used to buy new hardware for the list, and no list exists, things
appear to be a little less than kosher (I am not implying anything here at
all!!). I more appropriate response would have educated Sean as to where
the money is (you did that) and what the current status is of the old list
(if you have that information).

You have not been impugned except in your own mind. I am sure Sean is
sorry that you have taken this in the way you have, but he did nothing
wrong.

Let's take the high road on this one and not read things into the text
that were not written. Can we all play like nice boys and girls?

Scott
