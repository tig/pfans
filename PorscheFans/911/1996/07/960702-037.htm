A couple of years ago I got tired of the "hand pump" method of gearbox and rear
end oil changing, so following Dennis' same logic path, I built a pressure fill
tank using an old soda syrup canister, modified with a one-way check valve and
air line fitting as well as a oil fill line fitting (with another check valve
and it also must have a flexible hose that can reach the bottom of the tank).
The oil fill line uses air hose fittings and line, and I also built a number of
nozzles (1' long with a small "U" bend at the end, a 3' long straight end, etc)
using air duster/blower nozzles from Harbor Frieght. It's neat, works quick,
and I can fill it with 2-3 gallons of oil and pressure it up to 60 PSI, which
is enough to last for a typical race weekend. When presurizing, USE A REGULATOR
and don't overpressure the container! 

You need to be careful in choosing your tank - I wouldn't use a plasic jug
unless you KNOW what it is pressure rated at (ask me how I know this.....). I
have three - one for engine oil, one for gearbox oil, and one for rear-end oil.

have fun and be careful!
