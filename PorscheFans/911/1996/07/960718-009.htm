OK guys, here¹s my last say on this subject (to the relief of 
many, I¹m sure) and then we can get on with more Porsche specific 
talk.  I want to thank those of you who sent me the encouraging 
e-mails during this little spat, telling me that I was still not alone 
in wondering what happened to Porschephiles and the $10K that was 
collected.  

	    In the end, by piecing several of your e-mails together, I 
believe I have come up with the answer to my original question.  
Sadly, it was not the answer I was hoping for...  I¹ll let you draw 
your own conclusions from the exerpts below:



Hi Pholks.  Be of good cheer!  In late December I sent our beloved 
Listmeister a check from you generous Patrons and Members in the 
amount of $10,2xx.xx.

On Tuesday (yesterday), Stan told me that he's taking the rest of the 
week off to install the new hardware and software (the sound of 
cheering from phrustrated Porschephiles around the world drowns out 
the rest of Unka Bart's message...)

I'm sure that Stan will brief us all on the details as soon as time 
permits

------------------------------------------------------------------

The Phund was established to offer some relief for the accumulated
burden of running Porschephiles.  There was never a statement of
purpose for the Phund.  In fact, it was boldly stated that Stan
could/should do whatever he wanted with the funds.  The Phund was
basically a gesture of Thanks from the Philes participants to Stan.

However, there was an "implied" sense that the Phund would be used to
ensure the longevity of Phorschephiles.  Since Porschephiles has since
died, I can understand someone wondering about it.  But technically,
we have no right to question it.  The contributions were Donations
with NO terms or conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I realize that he did make quite a sacrifice for a number of years 
keeping pfiles going.  The thing is, *no one* made him do it.  His 
actions for the past year or so (since it became a nightmare getting 
any administrative changes made on the list) were unacceptable.  Like 
Blaine said - at least he could shoot us a message and tell us about 
the new engine/paint job/gambling trip the $10k got him.
