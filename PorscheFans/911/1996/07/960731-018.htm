Bill,

Don't go to sleep to fast:
I think the temperature you measured is NOT your "engine-oil"  
temperature but just the temperature of the oil in the tank.
The engine temperature is a result of the relatively cool oil which goes in to
the engine, and the heat added to it by six hardworking cylinders.

So: the temperature in the oil-tank is always lower than the actual engine
temperature.
I don't have any clue what is the normal reading for the temperature in the oil
tank but I'm sure someone on the list does (or tells me my opinion should
stay..... ,  well...., just my opinion)

Hope your still able to sleep,

P.S. A couple of months ago I mailed with a guy on P-philes about doorpockets.
Because my PC got nicked, I lost your Address (and a lot more). If your also on
P-fans, please  send me a E-mail (if still interested)
