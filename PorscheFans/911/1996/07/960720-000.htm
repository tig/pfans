Have you checked the fan over the front condenser?  At least in my '80, 
it's located in a black plastic housing next to the battery.  Mine went 
dead, acted like that when I was going slow, then AC worked a little 
better as speed picked up.  Take it up to 100 and see how the AC blows 
heh heh.  As for performance, though I hear a lot of people bitch about 
their AC, I've always been pretty satisfied with mine, even with the 
earlier vents.  Guess it all depends on your expectations...

Why mess with it when you have a car so small you might hit the 
passenger's lock with your elbow while shifting?  Seriously, it's just 
more junk floating around in your door panels and electrical system to go 
wrong.

That's weird.  My car has a tail, and yet, over 9 years of owning 
Porsches, while the front hood shocks work fine for a period of about 2 
weeks or one cold spell after installation, I've never had a problem in 
back, even with the ratty little '73 Targa that had a fake fiberglass 
whale tail and a serious colony of ants living inside the side rubber S 
trim.  (Aside: I drove that car once - home from the dealer, but now I've 
heard it looks great and is doing track events - hmmm, when I drove it, I 
couldn't get it over 30, and it leaned heavily to one side)
