I considering replacing the Blaupunkt Reno radio in my 911 with a CD
player.  Ideally, I'd like this switch to be as painless as possible,
and I'm not looking to spend a lot of money.

So the first thought that comes to mind it to replace it with another
Blaupunkt.  Would this be as simple as unplugging the old radio and
plugging in the new one?

I also thought about replacing it with a CD player which would have been
on option when the car was new.  Does anyone know if a CD player was an
option for an '89 911 and if so which models were available?

If I choose to go with a Blaupunkt, what are the different models available
and how do they compare?  How do these compare with models from other
manufactures

Thanks...
