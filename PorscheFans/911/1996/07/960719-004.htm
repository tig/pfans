Peter, 

My apologies to you & the list for posting this, but I want to say it 
publicly:  

I'm a formper 'phile, and Phund contributor.  My money was sent in to 
be given to Stan to use however he saw fit.  Hell, initially all we 
were trying to do was buy his 914 race car so he wouldn't be forced
to sell it!  For all he did for us, running that list, he's bloody 
well welcome to it.  I got far more value out of that list than the 
meager financial contribtion I made to it.  Sorry if others don't
feel the same, but for me, it's:

Thank you Stan, and thank you, Bart.

Now, let's get back to the P-cars.

Henry Bibb
Still fixing up my 914
