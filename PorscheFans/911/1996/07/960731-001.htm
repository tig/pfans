Greg:

This isn't all THAT surprising, I guess... If you look inside a 
Quaife, you'll see that it contains a lot of components, each of 
which is pretty damn small.

Someone (Scott Winders, maybe?) asked about the Quaife's theory of 
operation.  My usual disclaimer ("I could be WAY wrong about this") 
notwithstanding, I think I have a pretty good idea.

    Note:  I've never actually held a disassembled Quaife in my
    hands... This explanation, such as it is, is based solely on a
    not-too-detailed exploded view of the differential in one of
    Quaife's promotional leaflets. 

The Quaife seems to be based on a worm-and-wheel concept.  
Worm-and-wheel arrangements have an interesting property:  They can 
only transmit torque in one direction.  This is why they're used on 
winch motors and automatic garage-door operators; they have a 
built-in "ratcheting" effect.

The nice thing about this sort of arrangement is that it
automatically sends torque only to the appropriate wheel, at an
infinitely-variable rate.  Since the drive is essentially
frictionless (in the sense that no clutch-pack friction discs are
required for its proper operation), the Quaife's locking ratio
doesn't change over time and it doesn't need periodic overhauls to
replace consumable components.

On the other hand...

The biggest not-so-nice feature of a worm-and-wheel is its inherent
inefficiency. Quaife seem to have worked around this, somewhat, with
their multiplicity of worm gears.  There's a tradeoff, though... As I
mentioned above, each of those gears is pretty small and, therefore,
weak.

But I digress.

Ok...

Each half of the differential has a set (five, in the drawing
I have) of these helical gears floating in pockets arranged around
its perimeter.  The gears in each set are long enough to engage the
other set, and each set surrounds a central gear fixed to that side's 
halfshaft.  Between the two halves is a set of what look like 
Belleville spring washers to preload the gears.

At this point, I'm sure no one has any idea what the hell I'm talking 
about... I really wish I had a way to draw a picture of the thing.

I'll continue anyway, though...

Under normal (no slip) conditions, the helical gears float in their
pockets and each set meshes with the other, providing an even 
torque-split between the two sides.

When one wheel slips, the helical gears jam in their pockets, which
transfers torque through those central fixed halfshaft gears to the
wheel that ISN"T slipping.  

Since the degree of "jamming" is proportional to the amount of
slippage, the torque-transfer is smooth and progressive.  The
differential never completely locks. 

If the above description of the Quaife's operation is completely
wrong, please correct me; if I actually KNEW anything about
mechanical engineering, I'd probably be designing racecar parts
rather than banging my head against the wall writing microcontroller
software for a living.

P.S.  In my Rolodex, inexplicably, is the following contact
information for the people who make the Quaife differential.  I'm
sure that, if anyone's interested, the company would be happy to
provide a detailed, guaranteed-correct description of the thing's
theory of operation.

Note that the "011 44" prefix is required for calls originating here
in the States; P-Fans in other countries will probably need to dial
some other combination of digits.
