First: thanks to all the responses so far!  I still have the question, though,
how do you tell if you need to rebuild the pump?  What are the standard
symptoms?

Actually, the one plug I saw with this effect was mostly black with some
definite areas of white feathered-into the black.  My mechanic suggested
that the car was running lean for part of the rev range and rich for other
parts.

He comes highly recommended (Bruce Anderson) and has done well on the track
(he was chief wrench on the 4th or 6th place -- I don't remember --car at
Daytona).

After he messes with the car it gets better.  Then, after a couple months
of driving it progressively gets worse.  This cycle has happened three 
times, now.

This seems to be bourne-out by my mechanic's measurements.  Apperently,
the car measured (measuring emissions through the tailpipe) okay throughout 
the rev range.  I was suspecting the over-run cut-off circuit.
