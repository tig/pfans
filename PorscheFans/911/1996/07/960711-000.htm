Hi, I just discovered this list today and, considering that I signed up for 
the Porschephiles list several MONTHS ago and never received a single message from that 
list, am very excited to finally have discovered a real live 911 list.

So, for my inagural posting I'll post my current nagging problem with my '86 Carrera 
(which has 50k miles on it btw):



My '86 Carrera has developed a confusing 
intermittant problem recently. When cold, 
the car will start and run just fine. However, 
occasionally, after the car has totally warmed up
and has subsequently been parked (such as when 
running errands), it will repeatedly stall after 
being restarted. However, once I am able to get the
car to run again, it will run just fine.

The latest incident was particularly severe, and I'll 
describe it in detail to assist anyone trying to help
me out:

I parked the car on a small hill with the front of 
the car facing up the hill (Is the tap in the gas 
tank at the back of the tank?), left it sitting 
with the engine off for about 5 minutes (I picked 
up some drycleaning), restarted it (with no problem), 
and drove it to my house (1/2 mile away). After 
arriving at my house, I left the car idling. After
about 10 seconds the engine quit, would restart for 
about 10+ seconds and quit again.

To further test the situation (and see if I needed to 
get a tow truck), I got the car running again and 
drove it around my neighborhood, where it both 
intermittantly ran fine and totally lost power (as if 
the ignition key were turned off) for about 1/2 mile, 
after that, the car ran fine, and I parked it at my 
house and turned off the engine after it had smoothly 
idled for about a minute.

I have come up with several possible sources for 
this problem:

1) I got a BAD tank of gas (the problem cropped up on 
my current tank of gas) 

2) I have some sort of Ignition problem. (Note, within the 
past 1000 miles, I replaced the alternator and voltage 
regulator because the voltage regluator had failed,
causing voltage spikes that would intermittently shut
down my radio)

3) Vapor lock (the problem initially manifest itself on
very hot days -- 90-95 degrees -- when I was using the air conditioning and
the tempature gauge was pointing to between 9 and 10 
o'clock)

4) DEMONIC POSSESION?



Thanks in advance for any advice/suggestions, 

Darrin Sacks (gonzo@nmaa.org)

BTW, I have also posted this question on the Porsche Chat Board --
