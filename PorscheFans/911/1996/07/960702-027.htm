Hi Harley, 

Sounds like a good car to me. You are wise having a mechanic check the car
over for you. Is this the mechanic that will be doing your future
maintenance? It is a good idea to use that guy if possible and let him know
that you will then bring the car to him for service. That way he knows that
you two are buying the car together and that he will have some ownership, at
least for any problems that you may have. 

I would have your mechanic pull the valve covers and check the head studs. We
are seeing a lot of cars with broken head studs.
