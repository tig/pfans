Hi all,

My stock 1991 C4 is going under the wrench for a personality upgrade.  The
goal:  to handle better for the 5-10 driver's ed track days and autocrosses
but still remain liveable as my year round daily driver. (P'phile readers
may recall that this was last year's project, but the time and money
weren't right then ... anyway, this time for sure!).

I'm grateful for past advice on this topic, and plan to have the car
aligned and balanced.  These questions are more about specific experience
with products, settings (spring rates and sway bars), and prices.
Specifically:

1) Springs:  At minimum I'll be going with the progressive springs. The H&R
set I'm looking at are (F 210-275 R 250-275).  I've got more than 40k miles
on my current struts, so I'm thinking of more than just springs. What's the
thought on the H&R strut and spring package being advertised in many places
e.g. Performance Products, etc? (The spring rates are F 250-270, and R
265-285.)  Is this package really good value ($3250!) or can it be bettered
by buying other components separately? If I'm gonna spend this kind of
money are there Porsche OE parts that'll work?

2) Antisway: What brand and size of sway bars are recommended? I've gotten
prices ranging from $379 to $600 for 3-way adjustables, I've been told that
I should use dimensions of F 22mm R 21mm by one knowledgeable shop or F
25mm R 19mm by another. It seems to me that simply using the same specs as
Porsche's Euro RS or Cup cars won't work since my C4 will never slim down
to RS weight (i.e. still weigh in around 3200 pounds). I'm confused. What
sizes work best?

3) Wheels/Tires: Can someone with experience comment on using 8x17 front
and 9x17 or 9.5x17 with zero rubbing on a lowered C4? What tire sizes (and
brands) are you using for track and for street?

I'd love to hear from C4 owners that have been down this path already!

Thanks in advance!
