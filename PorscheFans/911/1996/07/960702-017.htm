First, thanks to everyone who had suggestions. It's pretty clear that some
folks have had similar trouble tracking down a useful device, as there's no
shortage of hacks for doing the job!

Before posting I'd had the impression that there were some small
hand-operated pumps for the job, but the two auto parts stores I called had
no idea what I was talking about.

So after work I went to the neighborhood grocery/random stuff store,
thinking they might have some tubing of the correct diameter. I walked
through their auto parts aisle, and there, for the princely sum of $6.29,
saw a "Sta-Lube Fluid Oil Pump".

Works great! It screwed right onto the top of the Swepco gallon jug, had a
long enough piece of
ABS plastic hose to reach the fill hole pretty easily (I did have the wheel
off and the car on blocks, which helped), and had a nozzle with
butterfly/ratchet action. It took about five minutes of pumping at an ounce
per cycle, and it didn't spill a drop until I'd topped it off.

If I had to do this all the time I'd find one of the drill-driven pumps,
but I highly recommend this thing for the occasional use.
