My 90 C2 daily driver has been really hard to start when it (the car) is
cold. It cranks fine, but it takes 3 or 4 times before the engine catches
-- as if there isn't any fuel, it will fire then die immediately.

Once it starts, it runs fine, and it starts easily when it's at normal
temp. If I let it sit for >8 hours in the garage, it gets hard start
disease again.

I had a local shop look at it as part of a tech inspection, and he adjusted
the mixture (which was lean), but that had no effect on the cold start. No
other problems came up at the tech.

Should I haul it into the dealer, or is there something I can gently
suggest to the local shop?

-- [ From: Jim Bergman, ListMaster * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

The following have been barred from PorscheFans due to their unfortunate
medical conditions (inability to listen coupled with CFD -- Compulsive
Flaming Disorder)

    habrandt@aol.com
    hrubin@nyx.net (Howard Rubin)

I issued two warnings to drop the entire Porschephiles Phund topic. As
predicted, it has degenerated into namecalling. Most took the hint and took
it private; these two did not. As a child of the Cold War, I have a tendency
to launch on warning. In deference to the sudden breakout of peace, I have
mellowed and now don't push the button until after two warnings have been
issued. Those have been issued (and ignored by at least these two). 

I believe it was in "Candide," Voltaire made a comment to the effect that
you have to hang an admiral every now and then "pour encourager les autres"
-- to encourage the others.

In case anybody (such as habrandt) is suffering under any misconceptions --
this list is not a democracy. It is at best a benevolent dictatorship. With
the listmasters (self included) as dictators. Anybody who doesn't like that
can start his own list. Until then, it's my sandbox, and I make the rules.
And I throw out those who don't play nice. I do not intend to let this list
degenerate as some others have done.

Now, for the very last time, this list is PorscheFans, not PorschePhiles.
The PorschePhiles Phund is a DEAD ISSUE HERE. Move on to something related
to Porsches. I told you three times...

Pete
