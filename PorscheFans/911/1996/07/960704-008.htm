Peter-

Congrats on trying to adjust them yourself.  It is pretty
hard to slip the feeler gauge in there, as others have
mentioned, and simply loosening them a bit and re-setting
them seems to be what most folks do.  I sometimes "cheat",
in that I set one valve and then feel how much it moves
simply by grabbing it and moving it.  I then feel the movement
on the others, and if it's about the same, I don't adjust
anything.  911 valve adjustments stay good for a lomg
time, and the tendency is for them to loosen a little
over time rather than tighten, which is good.

I know that I will bring down the wrath of the list for
having mentioned my method, but it is surprising how
sensitive your fingers can be to very small motions and
very small imperfections.  You can easily feel 0.001"
differences.  It's also really amazing how when you use
a feeler gauge on the valves you almost always wind
up with a loarge setting than 0.004".  I've experimented with
a feeler gauge and then checking with a depth gauge that could read
to 0.0001", and the feeler gauge method always resulted in
an actual lash of 0.005 or more.

I think the bottom line on all this is that the
gap, while important to set right, isn't critical
to ten thousandths of an inch.
