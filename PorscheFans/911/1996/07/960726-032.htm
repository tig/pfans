The "just received" July issue of Christophorus has some interesting
additional "tidbits" on the Boxster as well as the first good photo I've seen
of the car with the soft top up and a rear end shot with the optional
hardtop.

Among the notes are "Engine auxiliaries are served by a single self adjusting
drive belt.  This eliminates adjustment jobs and service outlays are
minimized.  Camshaft and idler shafts are operated by chain which are
service-free and won't need to be exchanged for the life of the car."...
(that'll be a first...I don't see how you gain access for servicing
anyway...is this perhaps a truly maintenance-free "throw away" car?...:)).  

The article further notes: "Large, vented disc brakes front and rear with
multi-piston brake calipers in monobloc design, taken over from racing for
the first time ensure - in the expected Porsche manner - outstanding
deceleration values, even under hard and extended use.  Steering, with
axially adjustable steering wheel, provides favorable, individual settings
and transmits the precision desired for controlled sporty driving".  

As for the hardtop..."In addition Porsche will offer a light, 25 kilogram
coupe roof which is quickly and easily mounted".  Later the price
news..."Price of the car in Germany will be 76,500 marks, as announced
originally."

Elsewhere in the magazine (in news you wanted to know) it indicates that a
160 page Boxster book will be available Sep 1, 1996 at Porsche Centers and
Importers with photos of the new car and text contributions from well-known
motor journalist... (Is that you Pete?).  

An finally, for what you didn't want to know or care about, Prince Saud Bin
Fahad Bin Abdulaziz of Saudia Arabia , "a Porsche owner" made a royal visit
to Zuffenhausen and Weissach and opined that he expects the Boxster will have
an excellent chance in the marketplace (Wow! ...needed to know that,
especially for all of you who thought only Seinfeld drove market
trends...whap, whap, bam,....:))
