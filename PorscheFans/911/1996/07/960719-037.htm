We did the same to my friends motor. Where what I would do.
Replace the following items:

Thermostat gasket
oil pressure sending unit (metal gasket if ya wana skimp)
Cam Seals (we didn't do this till 6 mos later.. was definatly necessary)
Valve cover gaskets (and set lash)
Cam Cover gaskets
Rear Main Seal
Front Main Seal
Check all boots from air box (replace PRN)
Oil cooler gaskets
Tensioners (skimp with guards if ya wana)
Cold Start injector
____________

All the above items were  what we had to replace  in  the  2.4 of  my friends.
We didn't do the cam seals till later but it was  necessary and we  still have
a leaky front main seal.

The work  I mentioned to you was done to  a  replacement motor we bought from
Aase Bros. The original motor had a fire  and we  have since spent  tooo  much  
money on the head work, rod recon, case pins and work for  2.7's, cam's at
WebCam,
and rocker reconditioning.  We are induction, exhaust and ignition  and
piston and  cylindars away from having  at 2.7rs type  motor. I figure about
3.5-5 grand for the  rest (including the never ending insidentals).  In hind
site I don't think we'd do it again. The 2.4cis motor that is currenly
installed works  soooooooo somooth and feels sooooo nice and at the  speeds
we currently drive I don't know that there would be as much of  benefit as
the cost. Heck one could do a  3.0 for the same type of money  if  horse
power was the object. I could  be wrong but, it takes  so much time and work
to make Webbers act as smoothly as the CIS.

  There's  allways a  trade  off  but for  road use I like how  smooth the
2.4CIS
works. On the track is another story :-)
