If these are not sold I'd be hapy to take them for $900.

Can't imagine they're not gone though.

If still around, ring me at (302)456-0630 and let me know.

Thanks,

I'm finally getting around to puting a oil cooler in my  '73 911. Since
I'm going to take it apart this winter in order to repaint after 24
yrs, I don't want to place a "big buck" cooler in it yet. I've got the
hard lines for the rocker panel (from '74 ), but nothing else. I need a
front loop cooler... but which one will fit??? The early ones seem to
have flex lines-- the later ones just were longer with hard
connections.. I know the copper lines were changed in '81, but was the
length changed ?  I'd like to use the "long" loop cooler if I can find
one !! ( anybody got one they're not using ??? )

I plan to use new oil lines, if I can get them, otherwise I'll have to
find used '74 or newer ones to connect to the pressure relief valve. 
Also, from what I can determine from the shop manual diagrams, the
engine oil thermostat determines when oil goes the cooler. Everyone
calls the pressure relief valve a thermostat, but does it work to
direct flow due to temperature????

Any info on instalation or used parts would be greatly appreciated. I'm
working on a restricted budget, so cost IS a factor... Thanks.

other message asked all the questions. Any help ????? Thanks.
