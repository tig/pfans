Hello Porschepholks,
	Just drove my pride and joy '69 911T out of my brothers body shop 
with its fresh coat of blutorange paint and new floor and front pans! 
Some good used Boge shocks too.  Looks totally awesome now.  I have spent 
about $3800 on the car now (including purchase) and now only needs 
interior work to be a nearly perfect vehicle!  I will try to get a friend 
to scan a picture of it and put it on his homepage so you can see it.  I'm 
so proud...  :^)
	Hmmm...that leaves the cracked dash, ripped seats, sagging 
headliner, and worn carpet to be redone.  Mucho $$$ and will have to 
wait a LONG time.  Seat covers and epoxy (for headliner) will have 
to do for now.  
	The engine has a small oil leak from a return tube and is 
dripping oil on the manifold when it gets hot.  Not much, but I don't 
want my newly painted 911 going up in flames!  I need to learn a lot 
about my 911's parts and procedures, what is the best book for the 
shadetree mechanic?
	Sold my '91 Subaru XT6 for about $1500 more than I paid, and 
combined with the money I got for my 944 I have enough money to buy 
a nice daily driver.  Anyone know of any '87-'89 BMW 325i or 325is 
for sale for about $7-8000?  Please let me know, and thanks for book 
recommendations.

	Jay Karolyi
