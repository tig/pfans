    Yes; this seems likely.

    No such thing, really... The plugs can show only one or the
    other.  If your car was alternately running way too lean and way
    too rich, only the MOST-RECENTLY-EXPERIENCED condition would be
    seen on the plugs.

    If those "both black and white" plugs have black spots on an
    otherwise-white insulator, the diagnosis is simple:

    You have what's called "splash fouling".  Before you tuned the
    engine by leaning-out the mixture, your car was running way too
    rich, which caused deposits to form on the valves and pistons. 
    Your two-click tune-up restored normal combustion temperatures,
    which loosened those deposits and blew them up against the
    insulator, where they stuck.

    This is not a problem; assuming that your engine is now running
    at the proper mixture (it sounds as though it is from your
    mechanic's comment below), the plugs will be fine from now on.

    It measures torque, either at the flywheel (if the engine's out
    of the car on an "engine dyno") or at the rear wheels (if the
    car's on a "chassis dyno").  Horsepower is calculated from this
    measured torque.

    In this case, he was probably using his chassis dyno to put a
    controlled load on the engine as he tested it.  Sounds as though
    he knows what he's doing.

    It appears, then, that you fixed the problem by leaning out the
    mixture two clicks.

    I'm a little confused, though... Did the rough running go away
    after you leaned-out the mixture?  Did you JUST make that
    change, so you don't yet know whether the car's long-term
    performance has improved?  It's hard to tell from your message.

    By the way, it's probably unsafe to make assumptions about the
    mixture from the color of the tailpipe and plugs... If you allow
    the car to idle before you look at them, the intentionally-rich
    idle circuit will create that black soot that you've seen.

    Hell if I know... My car has Webers.
