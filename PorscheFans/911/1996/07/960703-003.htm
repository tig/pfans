i have recently acquired a 91 C2 Cab (approx 30k miles) and was looking for
some advice on the following:

engine cooling:   

there's been some talk about the need to remove a shield to improve engine
cooling.  what's the scoop with this?  does it significantly improve
cooling? what is the shields purpose? any downsides to doing this?  has
porsche fixed this in later models?

oil change interval:

factory recommended interval is something like 1 year/15k miles.  if using a
synthetic is this ok w/ 'normal' driving?  any evidence it isn't ok (other
than the standard 'frequent oil changes are cheap insurance' bit) ?  if it
isn't, what is a good interval?  

service facility:

any recommendations for (or warnings about) service facilities.  i live in
the san jose, ca area

thanks...
