Kevin,

Thanks very much for your reply.  I am somewhat confused, though.  In your
message you state that you use a 1" extension.  I tried a 4" extension with
the plug socket at the end and found that this combination was not long
enough to reach the plug.  If you are using a 1" extension, does this mean
that you remove the intake valve covers prior to removing the spark plugs??
Sorry if my question appears ignorant, but every other car (non P-car)
I've owned I needed to remove the plugs before the valve cover (assuming
the plugs are in the middle of the cover.)  Since this is my first time
with a 911, I wasn't aware of this procedure.  Of course, the Haines manual
doesn't give details.  Please let me know if my assumptions are correct.
Again, thanks for your help.

Sincerely,

Ron Bolsky
