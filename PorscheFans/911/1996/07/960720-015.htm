 Habrandt@aol.com responds to J. Yasha
 Kresh on the matter of Stan responding. 
 
 Yasha's post was innocuous. But Habrandt had to twist the knife a little.
NOW DAMMIT, THAT'S THE END OF IT!!!  This is how flame wars start. This one
ends right now, or I start throwing people off.
 
 Whether or not Stan was quick to add or drop subscribers doesn't interest me
in the least (I never tried to drop) and I suspect is ancient history for
most of us. We have a new list now. The old list is history. Let it go. Or do
we need to open forums to discuss grievances left over from the War of
Jenkins' Ear, and who's ox was gored first in Bosnia?

 ======================
 
 << I sent Stan a short email informing him of the "feelings" shared on
  this list and in particular the uncomfortable and !undeserving! position
  that Bart found himself in. I also sent him the last digest with all the
  "pepped-up" positions on this old and tired topic.
  In short, he knows about this and will (I assume) respond to this list...
  Regards, Jascha
   >>
 On what do you base this assumption???
 My guess is that Stan will "respond"  in the same manner he responded to
 administrative request on porschephiles!!!!!!

Pete:

I think you've really missed the boat on this one.  I don't appreciate being
threatened with expulsion from the group because you happen not to agree with
this particular viewpoint.  This post was not inflammatory, but rather, a
genuine expression of my thought that Stan probably will not respond to the
inquiries as Jascha felt that he would.  There was no profanity or
inappropriate comment in this post.

It would be highly inappropriate to only let through viewpoints that agree
with your own and to filter those that are different.  The example of a post
that you think is a "good example" is no better a post than mine.....it just
expresses a different view (which I happen to think is an incorrect one).

Perhaps you should get some viewpoints as to whether people want to have a
censored as opposed to a monitored group.
