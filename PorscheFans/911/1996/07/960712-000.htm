Mike:

I'm embarrassed to say that I deleted your initial message without
reading it -- the slew of "Is the list up yet?"/"Yes, the list is up
again!" messages was making me crazy -- so I don't know exactly
where this bolt came from.  If there's enough metal around the hole
(in this piece AND the piece it bolts to) to allow a larger hole
without weakening the assembly, Option 3 sounds best to me.

Option 4 is weaker than 3, and Option 5 (which I interpret as "Let 
the bolt rattle around inside a hole that's too large for it, and 
clamp the two pieces together with a nut" -- Is this what you were 
thinking?) is a disaster waiting to happen.

Options 1 and 2 will eventually result in the same situation as 
Option 5, except that there won't be a nut on the end of the bolt, so 
the bolt will just fall out.  Offhand, this sounds bad to me.

A sixth option, which may be impractical for your situation, is:

    Fill the hole with weld metal, then re-drill it to the original
    size, tap it, and use the original-size bolt.
