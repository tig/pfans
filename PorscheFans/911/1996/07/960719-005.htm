	For those of you following this thread, I took the car in for an 
oil change yesterday. The tech. working on the car called me over to 
listen to a noise while the engine was running. There was a low rattling 
sound coming from the front of the engine around the timing cover area. 
This noise wasn't there when they checked the car out two weeks ago. 
Neither was there any play in the water pump shaft. Oh well. So, it looks 
like the second hypothesis was right; a bad water pump. Unfortunetly, 
they won't be able to get to it til August 1 so I'll just keep my fingers 
crossed :) At least it wasn't a head gasket...
