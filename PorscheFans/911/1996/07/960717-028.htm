Wade Guthrie asked :

<< I know the car is running rich some of the time.  The spark plugs and the
exhaust pipe are black with soot.  If I accelerate and then back-off without
declutching, I get a flash out of my tailpipe.  After changing the plugs, my
car runs great but then degrades after a couple of months to something not
that much fun to drive (maybe the plugs are fouling?). >>

Which plugs are you running? I had the best results with Bosch
silver plugs in the 6 range for the street, (WR6DS) they are hotter than
stock so they don't foul. Now I'm running the "real" Bosch
platinums W3DP0 plugs and they are not as good on the street,
but should be better on the track. Forget the K-Mart Bosch
platinums (WR5DP) that cost about $3, they won't work well.

<< Anybody have a candidate to rebuild the
pump or should I just go with the guy my mechanic typically uses (I don't 
know the guy's name)?  Is there anything for which I should watch-out during
this process? >>

Hans at H & R, NOT. Pacific Fuel Injection seems the best bet.
