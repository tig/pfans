First I seldom get into anything like this..but.... 
 
This is a free service provided by someone who is 
kind (crazy) enough to do this for free.  
 
We are guests in someones home and we gather to exchange 
information and to share good times. 
 
If someone does something to offend our host...He "The Host", 
as any of you would in your homes would approach this/these 
individuals and express some kind of concern. 
 
(i.e., I know you have had a lot to drink, please use the 
 bathroom and refrain from peeing in my Ming vase.) 
 
We all have things we are proud of that we do not want 
spoiled. There is no sensorship when you are a guest 
only tolerance. Please lets not spoil the party for our host 
as well as for ourselves. 
 
 
(I do not know who runs this list ...but I thank you for your work 
 and your willingness to share. I really do hope this does not 
 become the major topic of conversation. I know this will cause 
 responses which is counter productive to the goal of this list sorry.) 
 
						Again Thanks
