Hi Jim, 
 
I can help with this one.  I bought a Sony, 8mm recorder.  I don't have the 
specific model # with me but there is a series of them characterized by a 2 or 
3" screen that swings out and rotates so you can see what you're filming 
without having to look thru the lens.  Mounted on a roll bar, a thru the lens 
camcorder is awkward to sight in as you have to look thru the viewfinder and 
to do that you have to be behind it.  Mine has a 24x Zoom lens with a remote  
control so you can zoom while driving (get it?).  It also has a steady shot 
feature and gives a very smooth picture.  I mounted it on a very good quality 
universal mount from I/OPort($90).  It's shock dampened also. 
 
My first attempt at taping was marred by the fact that I didn't get the camera 
mounting screw tightened enough so after a few laps it loosened up a bit and 
started panning from left to right as I went from corner to corner.  Made for 
some interesting special effects. 
 
Taping your events will impact your driving style.  Input sequences going thru 
corners now look like this:  Brake, heel/toe, downshift, turn in, zoom in and 
transition to gas, apex, zoom out, upshift.  The remote control is a handy 
little item too......The Sony's sell for between $700 and $1200 depending on 
features. 
 
Now, on another issue, for the Portland Race next month.....let's talk rain 
tires.  We Californicaters don't usually have to deal with this.....Should I 
have 'em and what do you rain soaked folks in the N'west prefer? 
 
Ted

Question for you track people with a video camera in your car:

I want to mount a camera on my roll cage cross brace; any recommendations
for a camera and the mounting hardware?
