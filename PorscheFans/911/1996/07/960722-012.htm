Guys,

One of the things I really disliked about the Philes was the contributions
made by people who thought they had a right to use four letter words and to
delve into personal, petty attacks on people with whom they disagreed.  This
morning, however, I read that two individuals who were doing what I abhored
on the other list were being expulsed from this one.  Now I can't decide if I
like less the garbage that we were subjected to from a few sophomoric
indivduals or overt censorship (?).
