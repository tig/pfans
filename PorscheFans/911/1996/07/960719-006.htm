My car failed tech for LRP due to no brake lights and loose rear wheel 
bearings.  I found a blown fuse for the brake lights.  After changing the 
fuse, it immediately blew again.  I suppose that means I have a short 
somewhere.  I believe they were working before I removed my gas tank recently.
 There is a relay of some sort below the fuse-box which I had hooked the tank 
on and jiggled around so it's possible I broke something in the process.  Any 
ideas on how to go about debugging this w/o reading a wiring diagram?  

I'm getting rear bearings replaced today.  I decided to bite the bullet and 
let a pro do it.  Removing the control arm looks like a PITA and he says he 
rigged up a jig to replace it on the car.  It this possible without using 
brute force i.e. big hammer?  Estimate was 1 to 1 1/2 hrs per side which is 
not bad.  Looking over the repair records from PO, rear bearings were replaced
8k miles and 4 yrs ago.  Why would they wear out so quickly?  The RR is much 
looser and I did have a loose shock on that side due to a stripped nut.  Could
that contribute to increased wear of the bearing?

TIA,
