Fifth Round at the British Grand Prix
-------------------------------------

Emmanuel Collard Rules Silverstone Weekend

Frenchman Emmanuel Collard (JMB Competition) convincingly lead the field
from green light to chequered flag to his fourth consecutive win,
dominating the Silverstone round of the Porsche Pirelli SuperCup. It was
a perfect weekend for the 25 year old Tyrrel Formula 1 test pilot who
not only won the race, but achieved pole position and fastest lap, too.
The unassuming star remained humble even after his admirable performance:
"I had a big practice advantage over the others here. Last week I spent
a lot of time in a Formula 1 cockpit on the Silverstone circuit." Only
Dutchman Patrick Huisman, who started from the first row, was able to
keep up with the Frenchman, finishing in second place five seconds behind.
His younger brother Duncan snatched 6th place, topping off the weekend
for the Huisman family.

The personable VIP driver, Allan McNish from Dumfries in Scottland,
battled over the entire distance with reigning Carrera Cup Champion
Harald Grohs (D, Manthey Racing). Said the Formula 1 test driver after
his race: "Harald and I had a fabulous and fair battle. It was a shame I
finished playing in the sand, while Harald made it to 9th place. but I
enjoyed every lap in the Porsche." Former Motorcycle World Champion
Kevin Schwantz (USA), starting with his traditional number 34, commented:
"First I had way too much wheel-spin at the start and lost three places.
Then there was so much turbulence around me with spinning Porsches I
throttled off. Then I tried to attack which was too tough on my tyres.
All in all I think I should get another chance on a familiar track, and
it would be great to have air conditioning!" Kevin finished his race 13th.

Oliver Mathei (D, Manthey Racing) gave a breathtaking performance fighting
his way from the back of the pack to an imressive fifth position after
being shunted by Juergen von Gartzen (D, Oberbayern Motorsport).
Von Gartzen, last year's runner up, took 3rd still holding on to his
overall title chances. Twenty year old Patrick Simon (Porsche Zentrum
Koblenz) from Germany once again demonstrated his fine driving talent
ending up fourth. The fast track obviously suited Horst Farnbacher
(Zepter Racing Team), Joerg Bergmeister (Porsche Zentrum Koblenz), and
Danny Pfeil (Kadach Tuning) all from Germany, who grabbed seventh,
eighth, and tenth places respectively.

Top ten results:
