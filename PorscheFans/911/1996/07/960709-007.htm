Hey,

A friend of mine at work that used to work on a pro-stock drag team (he
knows what he's talking about, generally) gave me the following
tip on when to adjust valves.  After thinking about it for a few minutes
it does make sense.  He said this method is widely used in the
racing world as it negates the need to constantly check the position
of the crank pulley when adjusting valves (plus you can do the intake
and exhaust at the same time, then just move on to the next cylinder).

Anyway, here is his tip for when to make the adjustment:

Adjust intake as exhaust starts to open

Adjust exhaust as intake starts to close

Does this make sense?  I'd like some feedback if it doesn't.

Thanks,

Mike Dayton
