Phil:

The guy is, however, going to register his car SOMEWHERE.  Even
though Colorado's smog rules aren't as oppressive as ours, the car
WILL fail them if its emission-control equipment is missing or
disabled.  Knowledge that the car passes California's strict
standards will pretty much ensure that it'll also pass Colorado's...
The $30 California smog-test fee is cheap compared to the hundreds
or thousands of dollars it might cost to bring a modified car into
compliance.

Apparently, it's pretty hard to cheat the Colorado system
nowadays... All cars built after 1981 or '82 are tested by a single
state-selected company called Envirotest or something.  Since they
have the monopoly on new-car testing, there's not much incentive for
them to cheat.
