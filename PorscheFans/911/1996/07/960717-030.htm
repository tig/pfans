Hi Scott,

I see electric impact wrenches advertised in the Northern Hydraulic
and Harbor Freight catalogs all the time. According to the ad:
  1/2" Electric Impact Wrench
   New industrial design with 7.5 amp high torque motor hits bolts with 
   240 ft lb of force. Rocker switch for 1 handed forward / reverse
  $69.99

I use a compressor and air hammer, so I have no idea how this works.
Also, no power = no go. 

The track chairman in my region uses an cordless drill to spin the
lugs on / off. IMHO, it's no faster than using one of the cross
wrenches.
