It didn't then, and it still doesn't look to me that you aren't accusing *me*!

Choice of words is important in communicating an idea.  Yours does not indicate
in *any* way that you understand that the money went to Stan.  

Quite the contrary, it is, and remains an open ended implication that there is 
a question as to what happened to "...the money that was COLLECTED [emphasis 
added] in the phund?"  The "Hmmm..." implys that you believe that something 
smells fishy.  I understand that Dave Darling does not read this as I do, but
the fact remains that *I* do.

I have no wish to blow this issue out of proportion, but you *have* impugned my 
intregity publicly, and you owe me a public appology.  Your after-the-fact 
statement that you weren't questioning it does not change that simple fact.

Since you so freely offer me advice about how I should chill, or how I should 
feel, let me offer you a small bit in return.  Be a man, and accept the fact
that your careless writing has deeply offended an old friend, and apologize
for that offense.  Or not, as the spirit moves you...

Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart
