I have a couple of comments  in  regard to the  bleeding  of the  brake system.
1st  of all it seems to take  a  number of times  to  get proper pedal  response
when  renewing the  911  brake system. We  have noticed that the job becomes
much easier (but still  requires 3 or  4 sessions) when we reinstall  pads
that are basicaly all metal. IE no brake surface. I have  done this job by
"foot" with a  friend  and with  a tool  called a "vaccula"  which uses air
from the comressor to  "suck" out old fluid. I  think that air stays trapped in
the back  cylindar of the ATE  calipers and by using worn out  pads  we  get
more  travel upon the cylindar. 

We basicaly  reassemble the system with worn  out pads, and then suck the
new  fluid  thru the system. Then we hand (or should that be foot) bleed the
system
2  or 3  times. The we install the new pads and  drive it for a  while.
Seems that  after a day or two  all the  air settles to the  rear of  the
system and
we're  able to get  a perfect pedal.

 I  duno why, it just  seems to work here, and not just on  one  911  but
the majority of them.

 Anyone else noticed  how much fun  911  brake systems are to bleed??
