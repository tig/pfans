<< Phans,
 
 I am in the process of trying to talking a friend/associate out of leaving
 the way he has installed his pistons in his 78 SC while rebuilding it. He
 has installed these CIS pistons with the dish or large recess towards the
 intake valve. He has stated that the haynes manual under Engine rebuild says
 to install them with the big recess towards the intake. I have shown him
 that in the same manual, in chapter eleven, that it says all CIS pistons
 should be installed with the large recess towards the exhaust. He counters
 that CIS came out in 73 and that the haynes manual would cover the piston
 for CIS and that the supplement section is for DME motors and beyond (I can
 kind of see his logic, but....) To save a nice rebuild from pink, pink,
 pink, thud on start up, please help settle this. 
 
 Thanks for the help,
 Steve<<
 
 Hi Steve,

I quote from the factory manual regarding CIS piston installation.
 Unfortunately I can't reproduce the accompanying photograph, but I'll
interject my own descriptive notes.
"Pistons for K-jetronic equipped engines have a turbulence (whirl) cavity in
the piston top (crown).  This provision ensures a particularly thorough
blending of the fuel/air mixture.  The piston must always be installed so
that the flat spot (which is opposite the "whirl cavity") in the piston crown
faces upward (towards the intake valve).

In other words, the "whirl cavity" faces down and the "flat spot" faces up.
 In reality when the piston is oriented correctly, the depression is more
toward the lower right, and if you look more closely, you will see that the
depression (or whirl chamber) is below the spark plug which, if you are
looking at the engine from the side, (and the head is installed correctly)
will always be on the right side of the combustion chamber.
 Installing the piston upside down, (whirl cavity oriented towards the upper
left) will result in contact between the piston and the intake valve :-(
