I had a similar problem with my '76. Common wisdom is to install the
rocker shaft dry since it depends on the friction between itself and
the cam tower boring. The bolt actually expands slightly when you
torque it. Note the position of the concentric grooves which should
both be equally inside their respective ends of the boring. Before you
proceed have a good close look at the rocker, the inside of the rocker
arm bushing, and the camshaft lobes for wear. If the shaft loosens
slowly as it probabld did, the camshaft and rocker aren't in perfect
alignment. I had to replace one rocker arm (you can replace the
bushings too.)

As far as why, I never knew on mine. A valve adjustment doesn't
require any change to these shafts but a competant mechanic should
know to check them when he is adjusting the valves.
