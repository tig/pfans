Hello P-fans-

Once again I am in need of your considderable collective knowledge. I own a
1983 911SC that I bought last March. When I bought the car it needed new
front pads very badly, so I replaced them with Repco Metalmaster pads. While
replacing the left front pads I noticed one of the little rubber bootys was
ripped, and had traces of rust around it. Needles to say the piston did not
move freely. At the time I did not have a rebuild kit, so I just put the
pads in and ordered the kit to rebuild the caliper. I did not get around to
it for a while. During this time under very hard braking the car would pull
HARD right. I figured no problem I know the left front caliper is in bad
shape, once I rebuild it I am sure all will be fine.

So I rebuilt the caliper, and I thought the problem was gone, then the other
day I had passed a car, and was traveling at triple diget speeds, and
planned to test the brakes by seing how quickly I could slow the car back to
the speed limit by threshold braking. In a straight line the car nealry
spun!! Needless to say this was not a pleasant experience!! The pavement was
new, and the road is very level. The car pulls so hard right it is not just
road irregularities. I tested the brakes several times since then on
different roads, and it does the same thing consistantly. If I let go of the
wheel while brakaing from some lower speeds. the wheel will turn, and the
right front will lock before the left, (duh).I can make the LEFT lock if I
put it on a looser surface, so I know it is at least doing SOMETHING. I also
have LESS of a problem in the rain, perhaps because the braking forces are
not as high, or perhaps because the brakes do not get as hot???? I have bled
the system several times, and I am having no luck getting rid of the problem.

I have been told the front shocks are bad, could they at all play a part in
this problem? I have also been told not to use Metal master pads on the
track because they can do some strange things when they get hot, causing
uneven braking, could they be playing a part in this? The wear on the front
tires just shows excesive negative camber, but is very even left tire
compared to right, so I would not think it is a bad alignment. I wonder
however if something could be loose in the right front suspension causing
excessive toe-out on that side under hard braking? I have yanked on both
front wheel, and they SEEM solid, but this is very unscientific, and
probably shows me nothing, except that there is nothing so loose that I can
move by hand. Could it be a bad master cylinder?

ANY ideas would be VERY much appreciated. I am out of ideas, and very
frustrated, and do not feel confident driving the car, it is not fun, and it
IS my only car, so I kind of need to get it right soon.

Thank you for your time.
