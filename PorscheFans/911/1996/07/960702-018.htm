There was a thread on this a few months ago on Porschephiles. Some people
suggested using rubber tubing and holding the bottle of trans oil outside the
car, above the level of the transmission, and letting it flow in that way.
Sounds like a recipe for disaster (and $30+/gal. Swepco all over the floor).
What I like to do is to take one of those pistol-grip oilers, take the nozze
off so you get a 1/4" tube, fill that with the trans oil and squirt it into
the trans that way. It takes several fillings of the small oil can but it
goes in quickly. This is also how I top up on those rare occasions when I
check the trans oil level.

No matter what you do you're going to have some overflow, if for no other
reason than that's how you can tell it's full. So wear old clothes, and
gloves if you don't like the smell of trans oil, and put something on the
garage floor. Keep a rag or paper towel nearby as you are under the car.
