Spent most of Sunday in the garage cleaning and disassembling the SC front
end for my car; I suppose it could be considered restful.... =8^)

Got the rotors turned; the guy at the counter mentioned that they had torqued
to the hubs before turning, as the had to end up a "matched" set.  ????? 
There are only 5 bolts (at 17 ft.lbs.) bolting that thick steel rotor to an
Al hub; that torque will affect the rotor's trueness?  Didn't make sense, but
regardless, I turned them in after torquing them to the hubs.

Cleaned what must be decades of cr*p off the struts and misc pieces.  Got a
good look at the brake dust shields and determined that they are headed for
the dumpster.  Going to put them back on for now until I get a new set, which
I will try to weld a duct onto for a a home-made cool-air kit.  Besides, I'm
going to have to pull the hubs off again in 500 miles to replace those burned
out old bearings..... =8^)

Out of curiosity, I bought a couple tubes of Swepco moly grease to repack the
CV's.  Used about 3 oz per joint (should I have used more?), and find myself
with 1+ tubes of this stuff left.  Would this stuff be good for packing wheel
bearings?  Seems to me that it should be as good or better than regular
grease, what with the molydisulwhachamicalit and all.....

Pulled off the a-arms, but still facing the moral dilema of whether or not to
replace the bushings.

Yanked out the out old m/c, and was ready to put in the 19mm unit, but forgot
to bench bleed it.  How do you bench bleed one of these things?  Also, how do
you adjust the stock 914 proportioning valve?  I know a Tilton would be a
nice thing to replace it, but I can't really justify it, as I don't I'll ever
fiddle with it once I get it set.

I also have my turbo tie-rods, and was wondering how tightly the end that
goes into the steering rack needs to be torqued down.  I was talking to Scott
Berry the other day, and was under the impression he just cranked the tierods
as tightly as possible when he replaced his.  Is locktite necessary?

I'm also contemplating an Al cross member off a later year car.  How much
lighter are they over the steel ones?  I'd love to get it, but it's not
really a maintainence item, so I'd have trouble getting approval from the
finance minister.... =8^)

It's nice to finally have time to work on this thing.

Mike
