Hi Fred, Mike,

Thanks, ithoughtsotoo!

One should not underestimate the ingenuity of a dealer, nor the
consistency of the misapplication of said ingenuity.  After
attempting Fred's advice on getting some sleep in complete
futility :-) I threw my search engine at the Pfiles archives,
and I found another very similar story.

Aha, them dealers BTDT !

Thats how it was too in my current target car. Installed on the
floor of the air-box, not on the roof. If you were a small mouse
living in the airbox, then that makes a nice toilet seat --
which is precisely what such a pop-off valve is worth!

But then I know for a fact that my prospect car's current owner
is not into the business of regularly turning out such
mouse-housing -- might be used as circumstantial (and not
primary :) evidence that the car has not had a major backfire
for at least as long as the current air-box, ergo is probably in
great tune, and has been gently driven with no hard
decelerations and such fun stuff.

PS: Should you at all care, I also found the following, ...  the
only other Pfiles transaction that my search query for air-box
orientation picked up ... :-) :-)

Could it be .... ?
