Hey, let me tell you, I used to think these things just got in the way of
cleaning my wheels, until one day.......

I'm driving my '87 Turbo at *****spirited**** speeds for a litle stress relief
after a bad day at work on a neat back road here in SoCal. I'm doing maybe
95-100 (honest, no other traffic was nearby) on a long sweeper when the car
gets very loose and before I can stop, round she goes, fortunately staying on
the road.

I get out to survey the damage and notice that the right rear is dead flat (and
smokin'). I had checked tire pressures that day, so I look closer. Sure enough,
NO stem support and the stem has failed, torn almost completely off on the
inner side.

Lucky me. Use those supports or change the rubber stems frequently (mine were
about 5-6 years old). I have always used metal stems on my race cars and will
also on my street Porsche's whenever possible.
