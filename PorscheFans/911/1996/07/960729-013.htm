Looks like I blew the notorious dual-mass flywheel at the Heartland Park
(Topeka, KS)
driver education event this past weekend (a really nicely run event it
was, too - thanks to
Great Plains Region of PCA). I did manage
to limp back home to Tulsa, taking the longer and more boring Interstate
route to reduce
use of the clutch. My mechanic wants to do a couple things to the car, and
I am interested
in any comments from the list.

1. Replace flywheel with Patrick Motorsports lightweight flywheel
which weighs around 7 lbs as opposed to 18 lbs for the dual-mass.
Granted more gear noise, but any other caveats? How much does
this help the car's acceleration? Does it decrease street driveablility
much?

2. Bypass the secondary muffler. Mechanic says this will result in a nicer
exhaust note (I agree it doesn't have the right sound stock) and will
result in a modest decrease in back pressure, ergo increase h.p. How much
will it help?

3. Lower the car with progressive rate Eibach springs. Certainly will look
better, but will it harshen ride considerably?

This is a 1990 C4, used for occasional cross country trips, driver's ed
track
events, and sometimes around town. Not driven daily, and not in
competition.

Thanks
