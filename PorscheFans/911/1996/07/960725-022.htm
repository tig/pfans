I don't know, $5000 for a 914-6 race car may not be a good deal, but it's
one heck of a steal.  If your friend has the cash, I would suggest he jump
on it.  I crew for a guy running a 914-6 in SCCA GT2, 1996 SCCA Southeast
Division GT2 Champion.  That car is an excellent choice.  Like someone else
said, the motor, even is great shape, leaves you between a rock and a hard
place.  You could probably sell the 3.0 motor and buy another more sutable
for that car.  See the section on PCA club racing below for an explaination.

For SCCA competition, he would have to replace the motor with a maximum
displacement of 2.9 liters, and you can not use the 3.0 liter case and
downsize the stroke or bore to get it down to 2.9.  You also could not run
the 12" rear wheels, the legal limit us 10".  Based on it's current
configuration, it would not be legal to run in SCCA without spending large
amounts of money.

In PCA club racing, the car in it's current configuration would have to run
in GT-3r, normally aspirated, 2.8 up to 3.4 liters displacement on race
tires.  Putting a larger motor in the car is not a viable option.  The
horsepower and torque are more then 901 transmission can handle reliably.
There are other reasons, but I am not the expert.  I can get that
information if you want it.  Since SCCA GT2 does not have the competition
that it used to, we are going to re-configure our car for PCA Club Racing.
We are going to downsize the motor to run in GT-4r, normally aspirated, 2.2
up to 2.8 liters displacement on race tires.  This is a class where the
914-6 will be a front runner.  It will out handle anything else running, and
it can use a motor at the top of the limit instead of near the bottom.

We also have the body molds for every part on the car except for the roof.
I'm doing my best to get the owner of car to get a web page online or an
advertisment in the magazines to try and sell some of the 914-6 race parts
he has developed over the years.  If you have any questions, please contact
me directly at johns@magicnet.net.
