I am the PROUD new owner of a black '88 911 coupe.  It has 36k 
miles and is in absolute prestine show-room condition.  It came 
with F/R spoiler, BBS wheels, Fittipaldi steering wheel and 
leather.  I also got the original Fuchs wheels and steering 
whee.  All for $23,500, which seems like good price???

Anyway - the tires are Dunlops D40's. The front tire are the 
original tires that came with the car.  I figure I should 
replace them just because of their age, even though the still 
have a little thread.  However, they are worn mostly on the 
INSIDE.  Do I need to do something other than having new tires 
mounted?  (Okay - I am pretty clueless about this - but I would 
like to be able to communicate with my mechanic)

For summers, I would like some good performance street tires.  I 
was planning to stick with stock 205/55 and 225/50's.  However, 
I would like some feedback on the pro's / con's of wider tires.

I was considering BFG Comp T/A ZR, Bridgestone Potenza RE-71, 
Dunlop SP-8000 and Yokohama ATV's.  I would compromise dry 
performance for fairly good wet performance and to some extent 
for tire life.  Predictabe handling is very important.  Noise 
could be another factor.  In feedback would be greatly 
appreciated.

I, contrary to the previous owner, are planning to use the car 
daily - including in the winter.  Otherwise I have to store the 
car for 5 months, since I live in Green Bay.  I will obviously 
encounter snow, though I can probably avoid using the car when 
it is really bad.  I was planning to use Blizzaks mounted on the 
original Fuchs wheels (they are not in great shape anyway).  
Would 205/55's work all around?  Narrower?  Would a more 
traditional all-weather tire work better?

Thanks!

Henrik
