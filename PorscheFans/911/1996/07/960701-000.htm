Dear PorscheFans:
I need some advice.  On Saturday, while driving around town, my engine (1976, 2.7) starting making a rattling 
noise.  The noise is not RPM related and seemed to go away around 2800rpm, so my first thought was that a chain 
tensioner died - but we had installed the latest pressure fed tensioners only 300 miles ago.

First some background.  The engine was rebuilt in the late 80's by Butch Stokes, a reputable mechanic here in 
South Florida.  It had a hot cam, carbs, and a header.  It was driven only a few months, and delivered to the 
shop I ultimately purchased the car from for a paint job.  The PO was jailed, and the car sat until 1995.  When 
I purchased the car from the shop where it sat for these last few years, I had them install the original fuel 
injection.  The cams had to be replaced with standard CIS cams.  The car had a major oil leak on the right side 
of the engine from the moment I picked it up at the shop.  On Thursday, I had the mechanic who did the work 
check the oil leak.  He said that the gaskets between the cylinder head and the cam tower were bad and had to 
be replaced.  This didn't make sense to me.  The leak appeared to be coming from the middle and rear cylinder 
head - cam tower seal.  Why would both seals go bad at the same time, and only after the mechanical work was 
complete, and the cam tower wasn't removed to replace the cams?

Back to the present - So I limped home - (oil was pouring out of the engine at this point) keeping the RPM's 
just under 3000 (only about 3 miles) and watching the oil pressure and level.  I pulled the right-side exhaust 
valve cover.  Surprisingly, one rocker arm fell out, along with two rocker arm shafts (bolts?), some nuts and 
washers. I then pulled the intake valve cover and found two rocker arm shaft nuts had fallen off, and the third 
was loose.  I examined the parts, including the cam lobes, and it seems that no damage is obvious (although I 
wonder what the effect of driving with one exhaust valve closed for a few miles will have).

I believe that the noise was from the right-side chain tensioner because the loss of oil pressure created a 
partial failure of the pressure fed tensioner.   It seems obvious to me that the mechanic forgot to torque all 
the rocker arm shaft bolts on the right side. 

I've accounted for all screws, nuts, etc., and I've decided to put things back myself. I've read the Haynes 
manual and Bruce Anderson's book, and this seems like a very simple procedure.  I'll also check the left side 
when I'm finished, since I have turbo exhaust valve covers to install anyway.

My questions are:
Do I use Locktite on the bolts?
Will 15 ft/lbs of torque really hold the rockers in place?
Are these expansion bolts that can only be used once and have to be replaced?

I have absolutely no experience working on this stuff, so I'd appreciate any advice, criticisms, etc.
Thanks in advance.
