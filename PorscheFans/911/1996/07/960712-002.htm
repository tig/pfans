Hello 'Porsche Car Enthusiasts' (PCEs)

I have a question regarding the replacement of 'collapsible' oil return
tubes for my 87 911.  I've heard they are really easy to replace and
received dozens of responses from the list at P-philes.  I have since
ordered a set from Automotion (these cam highly recommended) and I can
see 3 of the tubes being easy to replace, although the one located on the
left side in the front seems to be obstructed somewhat by the Heat Exchangeer.

Has anyone had any experience replacing this tube? is there enough room to 
easily 'reef' on the tiny exposed region to pull out the rigid tube and 
replace with the collapsible ones?

Also, how easy is it to replace a timing chain cover gasket? the one on the
left is also dripping ever so slightly...could be more prevalent now because
I'm using a 5w oil instead of a 10w.

Input is appreciated, and thanks is given in advance.
