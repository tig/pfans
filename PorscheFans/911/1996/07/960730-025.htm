I DO have a copy of the Automotion catalog.  They sell covers like 
this, but they're only for Cabriolets, Speedsters, and Targas... I 
don't think they'll fit a coupe very well.

Anyway, the covers come in either grey Polycotton or blue, grey or
beige weather-resistant Technalon.  Part numbers and prices (from the 
1994 catalog) are:

Cab/Spdstr Polycotton    IC-7000    $54.95
Cab/Spdstr Technalon     IC-7050    $58.95
Targa Polycotton         IC-8000    $77.95
Targa Technalon          IC-8050    $87.95

Automotion's phone number is 800 777-8881.
