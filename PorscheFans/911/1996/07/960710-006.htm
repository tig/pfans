OK, don't everybody respond to this. It's a test message for Jim Bergman. I'm
not getting any PorscheFans digests either. For all I know there are also
people who aren't getting individual messages. But apparently lots of people
are still getting it, there's supposed to be active threads, responses to
posts, all that stuff. We don't know why some of us aren't getting it. Next
we're going to try stuffing Ex-Lax into the modem. And yes, I'm going through
withdrawal too. 

Obviously, anybody who is getting this doesn't know what the heck we're
talking about. 

Jim checked the names of people who mailed him saying they're not getting
messages, and the list says they haven't been dropped. So we don't know (yet)
why some of us are not getting mail. But Jim's on the case...
