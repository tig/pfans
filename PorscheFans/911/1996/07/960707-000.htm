Finally got a chance to see the Lemans segment on ESPN last nite for first
time.  Interesting were the shots of Danny Sullivan pounding on the wheel of
the 8th place McLaren BMW and shouting (wish we could have heard the
language!) when he came in for a tire replacement with less than 10 minutes
remaining and found the pit crew had already packed everything up to leave!
 (He recovered nicely on camera later with a "I want to thank BMW for....")

More amusing was the interview with Hans Stuck with about 40 minutes
remaining in the race after he got out of  the 2nd place (overall)
Porsche-sponsored GT-1.   The reporter first asked "would you rather be in
the WSC car or the 911?"....what did they think he would say?..."I prefer
Buicks for longer drives".... When asked if they could catch the Joest-Racing
Porsche WSC car (they were three laps behind I believe), Stuck replied along
the lines "...We knew at midnight last night we couldn't catch them...after
all, that (WSC)  is a full racing car while we're driving essentially a
street machine...."
(Eh....sure it is, just your average "vanilla" 911 with a few twists!)

Along those lines, a previous story was that another one of the GT-1 cars had
suffered serious damage, and the necessary repair parts were "...taken from
the 911 production line in Zuffenhausen in the middle of the night and rushed
to the track for repairs to allow the car to continue running....".  I've
read the Christophorus article on the GT-1 development ("Right up the Middle,
3/96 issue") which indicates the lower section of the nose is from the
993/911, as well as the instruments are common.

Can anyone describe how extensive the damage was and what components they
were able to take from the line to repair the car?

Perry
