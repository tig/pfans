Hi guys/gals, I have a question for you.  Is the 914 fun to drive like the
911? What I mean by fun is that as soon as you sit in my dad's 87 TL
carrera Cab, you are having a blast!. From the left side ignition, to the
beautiful gauges, to the great seats, melodic engine, outside view, clutch
pedal feel, how close the pedals are for H&Ting (heel and toe), responsive
steering, ahhh I could go on forever! I think that what I like best is the
feel of the pedals.  So is the 914 like this? My 924 isn't even close,
except for the steering. The reason I ask is that very close to my house
there was a cherry 914! It was the most perfect yellow color (my favorite
car color). I went back to see her and she was gone! ;-( It was raining so
I might have a chance that they had waxed it and didn't want spots.  I
will go back tommorow.  Wish me luck! ;-)
