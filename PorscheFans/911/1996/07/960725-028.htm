My 1980 911SC has a new owner. There is nothing more I can do
to it on weekends and I figured it was time to move on. I've had 
the car for about 2 years and feel compleatly confortable with it.
I know how to work it. The new owner is taking delivery tomorrow.
It's kinda bitter sweet. 

 Tonight I drove and layed my hands on an 84 Carrera Targa. I am
impressed by the handeling and the extra horse power the 3.2 provides.
I feel that I will have a learing curve (again) until I have the "I
can toss you around" feeling. I'm willing to deal with that. I guess
I'm looking for advice from the group. Here's my Ben Franklin list..

(+)
3.2
1 owner
Records
nice interior condx
move up 4 years
financialy atractive
Same ruber as I'm used to
Fresh Targa and headliner
hits the road solid feels nice and tight
pan solid no real structure damage
no detectible filler
(-)
Dislike color (semi metalic burgandy)
Booth fenders repainted
booth 1/4's repainted
non detailed motor
PO obviuosly non-retentive 'bout his Porsche 
Alloys need the "woods treatment" (brake dust food...ect no dings or
curb surf)
Clutch possibly light (not scared of the $400 for parts.. I'll do the
work)
Front view shows fresh paint on booth fenders all but the hood (it's
lighter)
Owing a car with paint work..ect..ect..ect..
Need to drop driveline for cleanup (keep me busy this winter.. no major
consideration)


So.. guess I have a real problem with the paint work.  My 80 has as
perfect black paint as
I have ever seen and I can see nice paint. The '84 runs and drives
super! My feeling is
I will be in a better equity position on the '84 than I am in the '80.
But I realy, realy 
like the way my '80 performs (except for the power diffrence in the
'84) I'll do a leakdown and compression test tomorrow (but don't expect
anything to show up).

What should I look for as far as weakness in an '84 Carrera? What would
you do? If you had an 
my 80SC and the option to purchase the aforementined Carrera. Pretend
there is no diffrence in
price (the milage on the '80 is 82k and the '84 is 88k).



TIA for all comments!
