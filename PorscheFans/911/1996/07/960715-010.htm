To all interested in being heard:

As the ad says,  "Tired of those whimpy OEM horns?"
"You'll get some respect with these...durable, metal case,
loud as can be! 118 dB.  Made in Germany.  German
Hella Horns @ $69.95 pair.

Well I'm telling you, when you honk these things your 
trousers flap.  You literally can feel the vibration of the horn
in the steering wheel.  These guys will bowl over small children
and pets.  I am not all worried about not being heard by the guy in 
the Lexus with windows up and the stereo cranked.  You will step 
all over him.  Very easy to install too.  Just swap out the horns.
The wires plug right onto the connectors.  You do have to 
mount each horn on either side of the mounting bar, and 
bend one bracket on the horn about 45 degrees to get 
it to fit.  I tried them out in downtown traffic and the people
walking on the sidewalks winced with pain and gave me a 
nasty look.
Where do you get these things?  Griot's Garage mail order
catelog.  Pronounced like 'riot' with a 'G'. 800-345-5789.
Item # 77573.  e-mail me back if you want to know more.
