I'm looking to put a rollbar (Autopower) into my car and have some
questions.   I've called (and called and called...) the folks at
autopower trying to get some answers to the questions below but
evidently they're too busy with other things.

I have a '72T Targa that has been converted to a Cabriolet with
the standard Cab top affixed.  From what I can gather the roll
bar that was made for a targa has rear mounts that attach to the
rear firewall.  

First Question:  Can anyone with an autopower roll bar in an early 
targa tell me where the mount points are?

If the mount points are on the firewall this would interfere with
the top operation I'd rather not use that bar.  The bar that is made
for the real cab, and some coupe bars that I've seen, mount to the
rear fender wells which wouldn't interfere with the top operation.

Second Question:  Can I use the bar that was made for the real Cab.
or one of the coupe bars.  Are the reinforcements in that area of the
car different for the different models.  I think that the targa for '72
had extra reinforcement in that area.  Was the same reinforcement used
on the mid 80's Cabs?

Thanks

Bill
