It is right behind the fuel tank, accessible from underneath.  You
must remove a protective panel underneath the tank to get to it.  It
was about a half dozen fasteners as I recall.  Swapping it is very
easy, but cleanliness is very important.  You don't want to introduce
any crud into the fuel system during the swap.  Also, the fuel
connection joint on the output side of the pump  uses two soft aluminum
crush seals.  These are very easy to drop/lose during the swap so pay
close attention when you break the joint (ask me how I know!).  I 
would not want to do it roadside unless I had to, but it is feasible.

I just did it about a month ago, on my '88 Carrera Cab., as my fuel
pump check valve had stuck open, causing a hot restart problem due to
to fuel vapor in the system after a short heat soak.  The check valve
is supposed to maintain the system pressure on the rail after the
engine is shut off.  It was easy to diagnose by hooking a fuel
pressure gauge up to the test port on the rail.  My system pressure
was going to zero within 3-5 seconds of the engine shutting off.

Just as an aside, my original pump was Bosch, made in France.  The 
replacement was Bosch, made in Germany.  As I work for a French fuel
injection OEM, I took great pleasure in chiding the frogs that I work 
with about how this damned French part was debilitating my expensive  
German toy.    ;)
