My '90 C2 started running hotter than usual yesterday. The weather is a
little warmer than it has been, but only a few degrees (70-75F), and I
don't think that's enough to explain it.

My oil temp guage has four white marks and a red at the top. I'll call the
top white mark "warm" and the next one down "normal".

For easy freeway driving (~60 in 5th) it normally runs within (generally
below) a needle width  of "normal" mark on the guage, but yesterday and
today it has been sitting generally a needle width below the "warm" mark,
and made up to a needle above the "warm" mark when I got stuck on an off
ramp for 10 minutes.

All other oil indications remain typical for this car: at 60 MPH that's
about 4.5 to 5 bar pressure. I checked the oil level last night and was
down a liter, and it's been about 2K miles since oil and filter change.

The bottom pan is off (as it has been for some time), and there are no
apparent leaks or other bad things that I can see in the engine
compartment. I took a quick look at the front to see if the cooler was
blocked, and there doesn't appear to be any obstruction.

Any clues? Is this something I should have checked?
