I understand where Dave is coming from, it would be great to have a pit
(even better to have a lift). I imagine you could rent a concrete saw and
cut the hole out of the floor. Dig the pit, then line it with brick or
block. The best way to do it would be to have a ramp exit, or at least have
the steps slope gently out. Then you would want to make sure the car was
not over the exit ramp when working on it. A fan mounted to the non-sloping
end could provide ventilation.
