Hi Gregg,

The shallow plug is the one that goes on the oil pressure bypass piston,
that's the one that goes straight up. They changed them several times in
quick succession trying to solve a couple of problems. You might want to get
the later version with the longer spring and a guide tube for the spring,
they started to use it in 1978. 

The reason that the cap is more shallow is that they wanted to increase the
oil pressure some. Later they were trying to solve an oil pick-up problem,
but this wasn't the solution and they finally changed the oil pick-up. 

The plain plug goes on the pressure relief piston which is the one that goes
in the side of the crankcase.
