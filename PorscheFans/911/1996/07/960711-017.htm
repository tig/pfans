Sure, that'll work. When exhaust opens, intake should be well and truly
closed. Same for intakes. But this method means you have to spin the crank
over more to do each one. Also involves more thinking. Lessee, which is
exhaust? Is it just opening now, or what? 

I like to just put it fairly close to TDC and do both valves for one cylinder
at once. You don't have to be really precise on TDC; figure that the intake
must have closed at least a quarter rev before or you wouldn't be compressing
the mixture, and the exhaust isn't going to open for at least another 90
degrees of crank rotation or you'd be venting all that useful pressure. So
you have a 180 degree window in which to work. Eyeballing a mark on the
pulley, even if it's just a temporary crayon mark, will be close enough.
