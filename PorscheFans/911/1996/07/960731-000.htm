Yes, but it's just as hard to put energy INTO a flywheel as it is to 
get it OUT, so you need less of a blip with a light flywheel.

Imagine a car with a tiny button flywheel... You'll be able to rev
its engine VERY freely; a quick tap on the throttle will bring it
from idle to redline in no time. 

Now imagine a car with a tremendously-large flywheel made of
something real heavy -- like, say, uranium -- and think about how
long it will take to spool THAT engine up between downshifts.
