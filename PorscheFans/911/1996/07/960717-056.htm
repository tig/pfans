    Don:

    If you don't plan on cheating the Colorado emissions-testing
    system once you get the car home, do the following:

        Ignore the seller's claim that the car complies with the
        smog regulations and insist that it be re-tested.  You, of
        course, pay for the test... It should cost around $30.

        YOU choose the smog-testing station (there's one on every
        corner around here).

        You and he go to the station TOGETHER and you watch as the
        car's tested.  Among other things, you make sure that no
        cash or whispered conversations pass between the seller and
        the guy testing the car.

        Once you have the valid smog certificate in hand, thank the
        seller for being so understanding.

    As far as plates are concerned, you'll need both a front and a
    rear, and the expiration-stickers must be current.  If I were
    really paranoid, I'd call the California DMV and make sure that
    the plates aren't stolen and that there are no outstanding liens
    against the car.  In fact, it'd be real nice if, when the deal's
    done, you and the seller both went to the DMV together to
    transfer ownership.

    California requires a front plate, but the rule isn't commonly
    enforced unless the police are just looking to harass you.
    Colorado, on the other hand, requires a front plate and the
    State Patrol WILL pull you over if you come through Eagle County
    driving a California-registered 911 with no front plate.  Even
    now, after they've lost the class-action discrimination lawsuit
    filed against them (I just heard I'm a member of that class...
    imagine that), I wouldn't feel safe driving through Eagle County
    without EVERYTHING in order.

    There are a few good ones and, of course, a bunch of really
    awful ones.  I won't list the bad ones publicly; if you're
    interested, let me know and I'll send you the list in private
    e-mail.

    I'd recommend three shops above all others in the area:

        Personalized Autohaus (619 586-7771)
        Dieter's (619 234-8106)
        European Motorsports (619 599-9307)

    Bank-to-bank wire transfers are good; they give you flexibility,
    a receipt, and some protection against fraud.  I'd carry a
    couple thousand dollars in traveler's checks as well (for
    deposits, etc.).

    Ok... Good luck.
