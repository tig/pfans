I was at Portland International Raceway today helpingt a friend campaign his
911 in a conference race. He has been out to sea all winter and he was giddy
as a kid this being his first race this season. 

It seems there was someone else a bit giddy in the paddock, one Jim Swanson.
This guy is one of the people local club racing is built on. He used to race
himself for many years but quit over 20 years ago. He gave it up and raised
a family instead. But he could not really give it up so he became a
volunteer. He was a very familiar face for anyone that ever ran a conference
race at PIR. He was at virtually every Friday night tech clearing the cars
for the next days race. He was always there, for over 20 years. 20 years of
touching the cars. 20 years of crawling around the cars. He was still a part
of racing...kinda.

Then one day, after a 20 year break, he decided it was time to step back
into racing, all the way back. He decided to drive. His son was grown now
and racing his own car. So it was decided Dad would regain his racing
license in his son's car. How appropriate, the family he gave up driving for
would now make it possible for him to return to the essence of the sport,
the wheel.

So Jim Swanson runs his first practice in his son's car. The session goes
well, no mishaps. He returns to the pit, steps out of the car, takes off his
helmet, and dies. Right there...in front of his son...right there next to
the race car...right there at PIR...completely surrounded by his passion,
motorsports. His heart just quit.

What a way to go.

Jim Coshow
