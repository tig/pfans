Thanks to everyone for their suggestions.  I stopped by the hardware store
on my home tonight and bought a few left-hand drill bits and an easy-out.
When I got to it, I noticed that the Liquid Wrench I applied last night
had soaked through, leaving some drops on the floor.  Good, I thought.

Crawled underneath the car, put on my goggles, and started drilling.
I realized a moment too late that I should have put on a filter mask
also.  Okay, don the mask, and get back to it.  The bolt was actually
not too hard.  Put in the easy-out, and started torquing it to the
point that I thought it was going to break, so I stopped.  I finally 
just ended up using progressively larger (normal) drill bits, until
the last one was big enough to get through most of the bolt, and then
the remainder chunks just fell out.  In the end, I just had to use
regular bits to drill out the old bolt.

I cleaned out the hole with some WD-40, and tried one of the other
bolts in the hole.  Surprisingly, the threads were fine, and the bolt
screwed right in.  Strange, I thought, so I took a closer look.  Upon
close inspection, it turns out that bolt was in crooked.  At a certain
point, the shank of the bolt hits the edge of the hole, and prevents 
the screw from going in deeper.  Unfortunately, the bolt doesn't go in
deeply enough such that head bottoms out.  I guessing that some DPO
cross-threaded the original bolt, and just cranked it in regardless.
Bastards.....

I figure I have some options here.
1) Get a shorter bolt
2) Put some washers under the current size bolts
3) drill out the original hole and tap it for some oversize bolts
      or
4) drill out the original hole and put in a helicoil or timesert.
      or
5) drill out the original hole, and put in a longer bolt and nut

I'd imagine that the fourth option is the best, followed by the 3rd
and then 5th, etc.  Will helicoils or a timesert be strong enough?
Also, it's not likely I'll be able to put something like this in myself,
as I'm afraid I might strip/crossthread it myself.  Should I just have
the car towed somewhere and have them do it (the shops I called didn't
even want to touch the broken bolt; I suppose this should be easier
to handle....)

Thanks again for your help and suggestions on getting the broken 
bolt out.   I hope I can rectify the problem correctly.  In the future,
I think I'll coat the bolts with anti-seize, even though it's not
spec'ed in the manual.

Mike
