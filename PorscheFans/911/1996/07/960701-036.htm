Sounds like you are going through the same sort of stuff I went through. 
Those shields can be easily rebuilt, I would bead blast them, spend a bit 
of time straightening them out (hammer and dolly work) and then bring them 
to your local plater and get them zinc dichromated...they will look like 
new, last forever  and cost about $40 in total. Only problem is getting a 
good plater, I have one in Calgary (Wespen Industries) who do fantastic 
work only problem is the proprieter doesn't speak english....

On the aluminum cross member, I put one in, two watchouts. First there is a 
little steel collar which mates up the body to the aluminum, can't remember 
the part number,but my partsman found them after only an afternoon or two 
of searching. Second is that the splash sheild does not fit the same way. 
Basically the fix is easy, you dimple the splash sheild to go under the 
nuts that hold the sway bar mounting straps. BTW, you could bead blast the 
aluminum crossmember, it looks beautiful when done, and yes, it is 
significantly lighter. Mind you, you could get the same weight advantage by 
going on a diet and losing 10 lbs, or always drive before lunch and after 
emptying your digestive system, but I digress.

The A arm question is awkward, I kept my original arms, just bead blasted 
them, painted them with matte black epoxy and they look like new and should 
last a fair while.....

Have fun...
