i've never used one of these but since noone has mentioned the safety
issue i might as well...

it is quite common for people to miss shifts in porsches at the track.
this typically occurs during a shift attempt from 4th to 5th or from 5th
to 3rd (sorry, i have g50 on the brain).  1st is often hit in the heat
of the moment and once the clutch is let out the engine over revs and
bent valves are the common result...

cars equipped with short shift kits are MUCH more likely to suffer
thusly;  the idea being that the margin for error is much smaller but
the heat-o-the-moment is just as hot :)

i don't know any advanced drivers who use one of these kits (on a track
car or otherwise) although i can't say to have taken a representative
sampling and done a narrow-error survey or anything :)  and, i do know
both advanced and novice drivers who have bent valves (or worse) with
cars equipped thusly...

in all fairness, i should mention that drivers of non-shortened shifters
are still able to miss shifts.  one typically does this once and then
has one's piston crowns pocketed (during the rebuild) so as to avoid any
reoccurrence (pocketing provides a bit more clearance for the valves so
if they float they wont impact the top of the piston and thereby get
bent).

in the spirit of "you can't make chicken sh*t into chicken soup" i leave
you with "you can't make a 911 shift like an mr2"...

yours in tire shredding glory :)
