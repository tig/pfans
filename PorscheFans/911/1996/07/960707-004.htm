I'm gonna tell you right up front I've never set the valves on a 911.  Being
a 912 owner I'm in the enviable position to be able to pity all you poor 
unfortunates that have to endure at *least* 50% more "entertainment"
come valve adjustment time.  (Actually, it's alot more.  I've looked through
it in the manual.  Does it make you go at *least* 50% faster? hee, hee but,
back to business ;-)

As far as my bona fides go, well, I've adjusted LOTS of valves and 
taught more than a few people how to adjust their own.  There always
seems to be a lot of confusion about "feel".  How tight should the feeler
be?  Is this too loose or will it go? etc...  "Feel" is probably the most
simple thing to do and the hardest to explain.  (Sorta like trying to
tell someone how to take a leak-when you've done it so many times
you loose appreciation for how hard it is to do the *first* time.)

My favorite illustrative method is the "go/no go" technique.  If you want
to set at .004" (four instance 8=), set it where it "feels" right on the .004"
feeler.  Then go back and "bracket" check with a .003" and a .005" leaf.
If it passes 3 and rejects 5 you can be pretty sure your feel for 4 was
correct.  Most people are surprised how tight the slide is for a correct
setting.  I also caution that, IN GENERAL, a little loose is better than
a little tight (but nothing is nearly as good as *right*!)

I wish I could take credit for this training method but I learned
it from "The Dirty Old Man" at TLC Volkswagen repair.  ("How about
giving an old man a little peck on the cheek?", he'd ask every
female between 8 and 80 that wandered into the shop, right before
he tried to stick his ugly, cigar stained tongue halfway down their
throat.)  

I think I'll take a trip to the can and see if I can work up an equally
confusing e-mail to explain the "feel" for the other thing.
