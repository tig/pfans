Hi everyone!

I have a friend with a 78 SC whose tranny popped out of 1st a couple of   
times and now won't go into first at all.  The rest of the gears are fine   
and the tranny makes no noise at all.  Trying to go into first is like   
hitting a wall, the lever just will not move forward.  No noise, no   
grinding, just won't move forward.

Any ideas?

Jim Cole

Howdy all,

The mail delivery problems with PorscheFans look to be cured.  Digging
through the logs, a large number of "DNS timeout failure" errors were
showing up.  A DNS is a domain name server, which tracks domain names that
are a part of every mail address (i.e., aol.com, ioio.com. nasa.gov, etc). 
When the PorscheFans list server was going to look up your domain so it
could deliver your mail, it wasn't getting any response back from the DNS. 
So the mail would be rescheduled for delivery, usually for about 10 minutes
in the future.  If after three days it didn't get through, it would get put
in a "bad messages" directory.  As of 12:00 noon PDT Thursday, there were
3800 pending messages, and about 7500 in the "bad messages" directory.  As
of 1:15am PDT Friday, there were about 70 messages in the pending directory,
mainly digests waiting for their turn to go out.  Problem -- solved.  The 2
name servers I had listed were our primary nameserver, and MCInet's primary
nameserver.  The problem was solved by switching out the primary MCInet
nameserver for two of MCInet's secondary nameservers, which are much less
busy than MCInet primary server.  Having three nameservers (the max for
WindowsNT) plus using less busy servers should fix this problem from now on.

My apologies for all those that missed their mail, and my thanks for those
that alerted me to the problem.  I was getting my digests right on schedule,
so I never noticed a problem.  Of course, I was vacationing in Yosemite, so
that just begs for something to go awry.

Some good news -- THE ARCHIVES OF THE DIGESTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE!  Surf into
http://www.ioio.com/PorscheFans/ and you can get all the digests you may
have missed going back to the beginning of PorscheFans.  I just did a quick
job on the web pages, so they ain't pretty (yet).  But the info is there. 
The digests through July 10 are available.  The process is manual right now,
until I get it automated.  I'll update it weekly until then.

Thanks for your patience while we go through a few growing pains.
