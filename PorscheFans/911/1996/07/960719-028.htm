Hey,

Does this "equal seating and restraints for driver and passenger" apply
at all driver's eds?  I have a 5-point harness in my car now, but only for me.
I am also looking into putting in a cage and possibly getting a racing seat.
For obvious reasons ($$$), I hadn't planned on buying *two* seats and
*another* harness, however I plan to continue doing driver's ed events
(at my "home" track, I don't have a need for anyone to ride with me, but
will at other tracks, most likely).

Am I shooting myself in the foot if I don't get two of everything?
