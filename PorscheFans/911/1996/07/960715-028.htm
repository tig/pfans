Hi all.

I apologize for the non-porsche content, but I don't know the administrator's
email address.  Sooo, I figured I would send my plea to the group instead...

Lately, I have noticed that my copy of the digest occasionally gets truncated
prematurely.  After doing a bit of investigating, I think I have found the
problem.

For those of you unfamiliar with the Unix mail command, a period (.) on a line
all by itself is used to terminate the message.  It turns out that another mail
application, called sendmail, also uses the . character for message 
termination.

sendmail is an actual transport program used for delivery of mail between
systems on the net, so when sendmail gets a copy of the digest that contains
a . on a line all by itself, such as the July 8 and 11 pfans, it assumes that
the message is all done, and stops accepting data.  Voila - short pfans.

What this means is that anyone who has sendmail between their mailbox and
ioio.com will probably also have seen this problem and be wondering who is out
to spoil their fun.

Resolution of this problem is pretty simple:

	PLEASE do not put a . on a line all by itself!

Thanks.

-Gabe Thomas
