Yet another question...

I am 99% sure that my backfiring is due to an exhaust leak...
specifically between the headers and the heads.  This is due to the fact
that I failed to replace the very old, very worn copper gaskets, as well
as the fact that my inserts have started pulling out.  If I get under
the car and crank on the header bolts (which loosen quite regularly), I
can get the backfiring to diminish, but it's still there if I'm not
accelerating.  In fact, all I have to do is just gently rest my foot on
the gas pedal, and the backfiring will disappear.  So, first things
first, having checked my timing and fuel mixture ratio (both of which
are perfect), is there any reason I should suspect the backfiring is due
to something other than an exhaust leak?  Second, and most important:  A
friend was following me the other day and mentioned that at various
times foot-long blue flames were "popping" out of my exhaust.  While the
flames hold tailgaters off effectively, could they be causing damage? 
I've spoken with a shop in my area about getting it fixed, but they
(like all Porsche shops) are backed up for many weeks, and I have no
other form of transportation.  Should I attempt to "rush" this repair?

Thanks,
