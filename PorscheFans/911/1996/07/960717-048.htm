  I hate to add to this already over discussed issue, But has anyone talked
to Stan??  I sent him email on May 28 asking about the Plist, this is what he
said..


  "We're down -- I blew up a drive and decided to use this opportunity to
 get the new Phund-provided hardware on-line. It should be up in a day
 or so as "porschephiles.org", with "tta.com" back to being my company's
 system, and mail forwarding back and forth between them..."
 
 Stan


So after another month, around June 28 I sent another message asking about
the list and I didn't keep the responce but to paraphrase.  Stan was in London
and would work on the list when he got back.

So if you have any philes questions send them to swan@sccsi.com and ask him.
Then post the reply here...
