Daryl, et al:

I won't comment on G50's since I have zero experience with them.

However, many (maybe even most) of the people I know with 915
trannys have the factory short shift kit installed. The stock
915 has to long a throw and feels sloppy. Putting in a factory
short shifter helps quite a bit. The factory kit is better
than the after market kits mainly because it does not make a
huge change in lever arm length.

A car 915 equiped car with the factory short shift kit installed
is not "MUCH" more likely to be miss shifted. There might be a
slightly greater chance but I really doubt it. Sure, the margin
for error is somewhat smaller but the improved feel makes up for
that.

My guess is that people that miss shifts would miss them with or
without a factory short shift kit installed. I guess people need
something to balme their mistakes on!
