Well, I just got back from the Steven's Creek Porsche dealer (San
Jose, CA )in my effort to see as many '84-89 911s for sale as I can.
They didn't have any this old, but I did sit in a beautiful '96 just
because it was there (but didn't ask if I could drive it!)  The
headroom was barely adequate with the sunroof closed (I'm about 6'2").

	I didn't notice the low headroom in an '87 I looked at, and am
wondering if this has changed much over the model years.   I'm
especially interested in Targas and sunroof coupes from '84-89.  My
'84 944 has over 1" of headroom even with the seatback almost
vertical, and I was expecting the 911 to be similar.  Any comments
from the 911 owners on the list?  I'd hate to think that I have to
narrow my search even further....
