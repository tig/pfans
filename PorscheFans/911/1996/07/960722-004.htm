The truth isn't under your hood, it's under your seat!  (where the Motronic
ECU is located).  Just make sure you disconnect the battery before going
in there.  But really, there is no reason to do this.  Unless your car has
been substantially modified, you have a Motronic DME system.

Here's what I understand to be correct - in '88 there was a modest
change to the Motronic in that a 2764A EPROM was used instead of a
2732A that the '84 - '87 cars used, when the first 4K of code was
contained within a mask ROM in the 8x51 processor.  My mechanic told
me that starting in '88 the units were adaptive, which made sense to me
in light of the timing of the aforementioned change.  I'm usually quick to
agree with Bruce, but maybe not this time?  In any event, it doesn't really
matter much, as the range of adaptiveness is fairly limited.  The Motronic
on my '91 Alfa is adaptive, and I couldn't sense any difference at all after
the battery had been disconnected.

Hope this helps rather than confuses...
