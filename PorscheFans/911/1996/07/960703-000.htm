        I've driven an 80 SC (with sunroof) with stock seats, and
a 75 S (no sunroof) with Recaros.  Both coupes.  I'm 6'1", but
seem to be long-torso'd.  I found it difficult to sit up straight
in the SC without a helmet, and I had to really scrunch down when
I drove or rode with my helmet on.  The S, however, was no problem
at all without the helmet, and I only brushed the roof with the
top of my helmet when I sat up straight.
        (Many thanks to Soren and Dirk for allowing me to make
these comparisons!  I promise not to spin so many times next time! ;)
        It seems that both the (lack of) sunroof and the Recaros had
something to do with that.
