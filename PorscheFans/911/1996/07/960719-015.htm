This is quite a ways off, but I was thinking about the eventual
engine transplant for my car.  I've got a '73 2.4T(CIS) waiting
to go it, but it's been sitting for almost a year.  I'm not
sure what, if anything, has been done to "preserve" the engine
prior to it being pulled out, so I'm going to assume the worst.
I'm tempted to try and turn over the engine, as it's hard to
have an engine just sitting there and not doing anything with
it, but I think it'll be a bad idea as the engine has no oil (or
at least is dry sump).

Is there anything I can/should do to the engine now, prior to
putting it in.  I imagine a tune-up (valve adjust, filters, etc.)
would be a really good idea, since everything is accessible, and
the engine is *COLD* =8^).  But that leaves the problem of trying
to turn it over.  Any suggestions on pre-install work would be 
appreciated.  Oh, and I plan on putting in one of those pop-off
valves too, just in case.

Even further down the road, I'm wondering what the differences
are between the 2.4T and S that makes the 50hp difference.  I
believe the S and T both had forged cranks, and the rest of the
bottom end is the same.  The S has hi-comp pistons; a set from
a 2.2S should fit right in my T and get me the higher comp, no?
I would like to ditch the CIS in favor of Webers (40's or 46's?),
and get some hotter cams.  I understand that CIS requires
extremely mild cams, and and retrofitting MFI doesn't sound like a
good idea.  The T has smaller valves than the S; can I have mine
reworked for the larger valve sizes, and perhaps some
porting/matching/polishing, or would I be better off getting new
heads?

Just sort of looking ahead and planning a budget.....
Mike
