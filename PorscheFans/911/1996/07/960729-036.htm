Hi Peter,

I just went through the same ordeal. The Reno unit in my parents' '87 911 went bad 
after a brief rainshower (oops, somebody forgot to put the targa top back on and no 
it wasn't me.

No, I got a Blaupunkt CD player, I think it was a New Orleans, for that very reason. 
I thought that I could just plug in the new unit. Unfortunately, Blaupunkt stopped 
using their unique speaker connectors, so it wasn't a simple install. It required a 
some wire cutting which I couldn't do due to a lack of time, but the end result in 
sound quality was pretty good, especially when compared to the broken Reno.

P.S. It seems as if lots of people have had trouble with their Reno stereos, how 
many people have had problems with them?
