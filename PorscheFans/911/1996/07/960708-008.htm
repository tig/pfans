Hi all,

Hope you all had a good 4th weekend.  The weather actually cooperated up here
in OR, and gave us the best weather so far this year.  Of course, some of us
spent it cooped up in the garage working on the pcar rather than driving
it... =8^/   I actually managed to quite a bit on the car over the weekend,
as I had 4 days.  Well, 1.5 days once you subtract the obligatory bbq's,
fireworks, family stuff, etc.

I had already disassembled and cleaned the front of the car prior to the
weekend.  The first thing to do was the put the bushing kit into the pedal
cluster.  The pedal box also required some rust removal and re-painting prior
to reassembly.  I also added a few extra washers behind some of the new
cotter pins to take up some side-side slop (maybe caused by wear?).  At any
rate, one of the easier items to handle.

Next came the suspension bushings.  I must say, it was a major PITA, but
in retrospect, could have gone much easier.  I started by removing the steel
collars from the a-arms.  The first one was easy, as the rubber bushing was
pretty much disintegrated.  For the second one, I tried using a gear puller,
as was suggested, but the collar was too deep for the tool's throat.  We
ended up using a combination of pry bars, and a hydraulic jack, and got very
frustrated.  Grabbed a propane torch and tried to burn the bushing out,
ending up with a scorched looking collar (which was repainted), and a foul
acrid smell.  But it came off.  So we started to heat up the third one, and
took a big screwdriver to rotate the collar, when we found that just heating
the collar expanded it, and melted the bushing just enough to make it loose
enough to slide off.  The third and fourth collars came off in about 7
minutes total.  What was that about hindsight?  I spent the next couple of
hours sanding and polishing the a-arms and collars down to a #0000 steel wool.
Also spent some time with a Dremel bevelling the bushings so they would fit
into the collars.  I ground them down until it was a tight hand fit, and then
used #150 to sand the bushings circumferentially (was told this helps with
the squeaking noise).  I coated everything with the special bushing lube that
was available.  This stuff is nasty; it's gooey and slick, and is probably
the consistency of gorilla snot.....  I highly recommend wearing cheap rubber
gloves.  On the plus side, everything just slid together nicely.  Time will
tell if it gets squeaky.

The turbo tie-rods went in next.  I'm glad I had the master cylinder out, as
the left one would have been near impossible to install with it in.  I
suppose I should have gotten the special thin wrench to tighten them, but at
the time, I didn't.  I put a bit of locktite on the threads, and used a pipe
wrench with a bit of cut-up aluminum can on the jaws; it did a great job in
prevent the wrench from marring the tie-rod.

Then came the master cylinder.  Installing those rubber grommets and lines
into the cylinder was a major bear.  I hope I inserted the lines deeply
enough; it's hard to tell how far in they went.  For that matter, getting the
new flexible lines on between the reservoir and plastic lines was no cake
walk either.  For future reference, does anyone have any tips/tricks to do
this?

The rest of the suspension was pretty much bolt-on after that.  First came
the a-arms, followed by new ball joints, struts, hubs, calipers, and SS lines.
I'm still contemplating if I should install either the 19mm or 21mm underbody
non-adjustable Addco sway bars I have, or wait for a Charlie bar.

I have a few questions now that the front is done.  The front wheels are some
7" Fuchs with 215/50/15's.  The rear will get some 8" Fuchs with 225/50/15's.
I plan on re-using Ray Scrugg's alignment method after I get the rear
suspension done (worked well the last time).  Can anyone recommend a good
ride height for the front and rear of this car ('73 914 2.0 soon to be
2.4CIS)?  Also, is there a way to limit steering travel, as the current
wheel/tire combo will allow the inside of the tire to rub the inner wheel
well at full travel.

Finally, I had intended on re-finishing the floorpans while I had the pedal
cluster out.  But the !#@& accelerator pedal bolts are corroded to the
floorpan.  I scraped all the dirt out, and it appears the bolt heads are no
longer hexagonal; I think visegrips may be worth a shot.  I've doused the
bolts repeated with Liquid Wrench over the past few days, but have not
attempted to try and loosen the bolts pending any suggestions you folks might
have; I figure at this age, this might be a pretty common problem among you
fellow owners.

Many thanks if you've persevered and read this far.  And feel free to ask if
you have any questions about the stuff I did.

Mike
