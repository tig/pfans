All right, that's it. The flames re the Porschephiles Pfund stop RIGHT NOW.
Anybody who persists in publicly beating this dead horse, from either end,
gets thrown off. 

If you want to discuss this, keep it civil and nonpersonal (just the facts,
just the info for those who need it), or take it offline. Post ONE public
message here in P'Fans if you have to, asking for private communications.
Sean, that's enough. Bart, nobody here from the old crew doubts your
integrity and you don't have to defend it against Sean. Jay Easley, ("We need
a sixth list. It should be titled
porschefans-those-want-to-argue-about-stuff-other-than-porsches@ioio.com
Please. I don't want to hear it. Take it to email or something before all
the people who want to talk Porsche-stuff leave the list."), well said, Jay..


This is exactly the sort of thing that belongs in the Flamer's Corner. If we
had one. Which we don't. So when we do, you guys will have top priority to
resume this over there and I will no doubt enjoy every bit and byte of it.
Until then, this discussion is OVER. We now return to our regularly scheduled
program of Porsche stuff.
