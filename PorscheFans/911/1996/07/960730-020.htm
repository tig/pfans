Paul,

The Quaife is not a friction device. It is a torque-sensing
torsen type differential. I do not pretend to understand how
it works. I had asked someone that did know to explain it to
us all. Could someone please descibe how the Quaife works from
a mechanical point of view?

I know that when I make a tight turn with my car, a 911 with
a Turbo LSD set at 80%, I feel the LSD slip and grab and it
makes some noise too. With the Quaife in the same tight turn,
there is no slip and grab and no noise at all.
