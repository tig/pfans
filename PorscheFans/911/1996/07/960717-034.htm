Well, here I am about halfway through fixing all the nitsy little 
things that are wrong with my "new" '87 Targa. I received one 
(original) lighted key that was missing the button, spring and 
battery. There may be one more piece, but I have never seen a 
complete one. Anyway, the local dealer has the lighted assembly for 
$18 and Automotion has them for about $24--yikes! I put "new lighted 
key" at the bottom of my "to buy someday when I have more money than 
sense" list. Anyway, it occurred to me that I had seen lighted 
key-thingies that you can retrofit a regular key with at Builder's 
Square. I dropped over there and had the salesman disassemble one 
for me. Wowza--the little button, spring, battery and lamp fit 
perfectly! $4.24 (with FL tax). 

I had to make a little metal contact from the metal contact strip in 
the new one, which makes me believe that there is another part in 
the Porsche key that I don't know about. Needless to say, I am a 
happy camper with a little over $10 to put towards my hood/deck 
struts!
