My first love was a yellow 914 that was five years old and had weathered
that many Pittsburgh winters. The handling of a 914 is difficult to
describe as it seems to be glued to the road--this is quite different from
the 911, which is more like riding a harnessed lion. My second Porsche was
also a 914, but I had to abandon it after grad school for a Toyota MR2. The
MR2 is similar in handling, but simply doesn't have that "in your face"
road feel of a 914 (or "in your face" maintenance either). This feel is
shared by the 911. I'm always amused at the people who think a 911 is a
luxury car simply because of the price. I remember looking at an '85 Targa
that a guy was trying to sell. His new Mercedes was sitting in the garage
and he was completely clueless about maintenance, upgrades, etc. on the
Porsche. The poor thing had a serious set of transmission, front-end and
engine problems. His last words to me were, "I think I paid too much for
it". Ach, I wander...

I've never driven a 924, but my understanding is that they were built at
the Audi factory, so they are just Porsche-blessed Audi's (this is the 911
list, so no flames!). The 914 was built at the VW factory, so, in some ways
it is a Porsche-blessed VW. In fact, many Porschephiles (using the term in
the broad sense) look down on the 914 for this reason, derogatorily calling
it the "VW-Porsche". Well, surprise, surprise, surprise--the VW bug was
designed by Porsche and it was certainly his greatest acheivement. The
bottom line is that the mid-engine design of the 914 gives it incredible
handling that has to be experienced. I recommend the Goshen Pass that leads
from Lexington Virginia into West Virginia. Pick a chilly October day after
the leaves have changed. Of course, pull the Targa top, leave the windows
up and run the heater. Now, open it up! What? Curve coming up with max safe
speed 25 MPH--that does not apply here. BTW, I'm not advocating unsafe
driving, but Porsche had to be thinking about the Black Forest roads when
they designed the 914.
