I have had valve stems break at approximately 130 MPH in my 914-6 race car
at the Heartland Park track.  This happened twice in one weekend, and I
didn't have the valve stem supports, so I switched to using metal valve
stems on my racing wheels.

I would recommend to anyone that is doing sustained driving above 100mph to
make sure this failure can't happen to them.
