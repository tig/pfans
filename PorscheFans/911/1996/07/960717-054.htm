Hi Pfans

Wanted to add my $0.02 and post a question.
My opinion of the Bridgestone Blizzak is that they are a great ice tire,
until they wear down slightly and the microsipes are gone, then they are
just a good snow tire. They are not performance tires and aren't speed rated.
The Eagle GW, (I have a set on an Audi), is available in H speed rating, is
great on ice and slush and is cheaper than the Blizzak. I would buy them
again when the time comes. I have no experience with Nokia but I have heard
good things about them.

My question, I want to know if I can install wider tires on the front of my
83 911SC without hitting the fenders on every bump or hard corner.
Suspension is stock except for poly anti-sway bushings. I have a set of 7"
wide rims with stock (125mm) backspacing. I want to put 225-50-16 A008RSII
tires on these. I know they will not fit now with stock alignment but will
they fit with more negative camber, which it needs anyway, and maybe a bit
of fender lip rolling?
Anybody done this? Pros? cons? There's a regional autocross I want to do
well in next week. Thanks in advance.
