I just got a call from the h/w store; they got in a selection of metric taps,
from which I hopefully find the right one to tap out that suspension
console mount which was screwed up sometime in history.  Assuming the right
tap is in, I'll be putting in a longer, oversize bolt, and cap it with a
nylock nut on the far end where it will protrude.  Probably overkill, but why
not, eh?

The next step is to assemble the new rear end (914 arms with 911
hubs/brakes/parking brakes).  I'm wondering what is the best way to install
the rear bearings (with common tools; I broke my POS Harbor Freight "12 ton"
press.  I think using a large steel plate as a cushion should allow me to
drive the bearing into the arm; there's a shoulder that the bearing is
supposed to bottom against, so I'll know when it's in all the way.  I
understand it's a press-fit, but would a light coating of anti-seize or
grease ease the process?  Also, once the bearing and e-brake assembly is
done, what's the best way of pressing in the hubs?  I don't want to hammer
them in, as I think that may damage the bearings, but my press is kaput..

TIA,
Mike
