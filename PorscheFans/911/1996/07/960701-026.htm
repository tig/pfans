          I seem to be having problems with the rev limiter on my 1979
          911SC, but I hoped to get some help with the diagnosis.

          Not long after I bought the car, I noticed a wire behind the
          fuel relay had been cut.  It's brown with a red stripe, and
          according to my wiring diagram it comes from the rev limiter
          relay.  Why would someone do that?  I figured the rev
          limiter wasn't working right, but for street use, not that
          big a deal.

          When I did my first autocross, I remembered the wire was
          cut, and I worried about it all day.  This weekend I
          reconnected the cut wires with a jumper and drove around a
          bit, and everything was fine.  I soldered in a patch, and
          then the troubles began.  While highway cruising later that
          day, the engine stumbled a couple of times as if the limiter
          was cutting in, but I was at only 3,000 rpm.  On the way
          back from that trip, the engine cut out completely at speed.
          We cruised to the side of the road, but the engine would
          only restart for a half second or so, and then quit again.
          I got out, snipped the wire again, and now everything's
          fine.

          Does this sound like a bad rev limiter relay?  They're about
          $100, so I'd like to get this right.  Also, where is it
          located?  I pulled some instruments and tried to follow the
          wires to it from the tach as well as from the fuel pump, but
          got lost in the maze behind the dash.  Do I need to take out
          the ventilation system to get to it from the luggage
          compartment?

          Thanks in advance!
