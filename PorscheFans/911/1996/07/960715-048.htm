I think, officially, the measurement points are the relative distance
between the centerline of the hubs and the centerline of the torsion bars.

In the front, I think the distance to achieve "Euro" height is about 108mm
(the hub being above the torsion bar) and in the rear, the distance is
12mm (the hub being below the torsion bar).  These numbers are from
memory, and they, for sure, apply to earlier cars, but I think they apply
to an '87 also.  This method, BTW, works regardless of tire size.

Having said that, a popular set-up is to set the front height so that the
a-arms are parallel to the ground and then set the rear height so that
the car is level, or has a slightly downward rake.  This results in a
height that looks good, but seems to be a bit lower than "Euro".

Measuring ride heights from the fender lips is OK, too, especially as
it is alot eaier than the ol' torsion bar-to-hub distance thing.  It is hard
to say exactly what your fender lip measurements should be though, as
they are somewhat dependent on tire sizes (a 195/65 is alot larger in
diameter than a 205/50).

Good luck,
