Andrew:

Stock 914-4s have:

	Right-side ignition,
	the same gauges (although not as many),
	poor seats,
    engines that sound like VWs,
    a somewhat-limited view to the rear,
    approximately the same clutch feel,
    the same pedal locations, and
    responsive (although non-power-assisted) steering.

They can be a lot of fun, but for maximum enjoyment, I recommend 
purchasing a six-cylinder 914... Preferably one with a big motor and 
a sideshift transmission.  I just happen to have one for sale...
