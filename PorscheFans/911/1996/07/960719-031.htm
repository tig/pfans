(not speaking in any official capacity): At Rd. Atlanta, I'm pretty sure
you'd get away with not having to buy a second seat, as long as the
passenger seat has a 5/6-point harness.  Harnesses aren't too expensive:
you can get a 5-point camlock for about $120 at Racer's Wholesale; less
than $70 for a normal latch type (which would be fine for the passenger
seat). 

Or about half a tire -- I tend to quantify all things racing in terms of
the cost of a tire.  It puts things in their proper perspective.
Spending $50-100 on the car may seem like a lot of money, but if you're
at all serious about track events, you go through a set of tires every
3-4 weekends (and knowing your home track -- Talledega's really rough on
tires -- I'll bet it's more like 2-3 :-)). That's about $600 in tires
every 3 or 4 weekends. Makes a $120 harness seem like peanuts...
