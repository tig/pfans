Hi All,

Here's the most recent experience in the quest for mechanical excellence 
(circa 1971) for Coupe #0038.

This car has never had even braking under panic stop conditions. Otherwise the 
braking was fine. The car is completely stock except the hydronuematic front 
struts were removed and a convetional 911S front suspension was installed by a 
PO several years ago. I had the the brake fluid flushed, replaced the brake 
lines with Porsche rubber lines and had the brake hardware checked over. The 
car has Yokohama AVS-i (AV-165-is) with 5000 miles of wear. The passenger-side 
rear would always lock up first under very hard (threshold?) braking. The car 
would slide to the right. This is not good. Often, once this occured the 
problem would either go away or diminish  during the rest of the drive. But 
then the both rear wheels would tend to lock up first. If I reduced the right 
rear tire pressure by 2-3 PSI, the braking would become more even (but never 
right) and the rears would still lock up first.

The Shop thought maybe a caliper piston was sticking or the rotor was messed 
up or someone had installed different pads or the front and rear. I was 
confused because if the weight balance was off this would explain everything, 
yet the effect of very hard braking making things better pointed towards a 
sticky piston (heat frees up piston).

During this year's Maintenance visit the Shop looked at the brakes very 
carefully. Pads and rotors are fine. All the brake-line plumbing is corect. 
Their testing showed the brakes were being evenly applied. So it's time to 
check the weight balance. It turns out the passenger side is light and the 
front is light. Now they look at the rear suspension and guess what? The rear 
torion bar/radius arm bushings are completely collapsed with the driver's side 
being the worst. 

With the bushings replaced (Delrin from Stoddard's), dialing down the front 
suspension a couple of turns and a complete wheel alignment the problem is 
solved. Replacing the bushings is fairly difficult. No bolts broke off during 
disassembly, but they rethreaded several holes. Now the front driver's wheel 
is the first brake to lock up. At this point I feel safe panic stops are 
possible if the driver's skill is up to the task. The car also feels more 
stable above 70 mph. Handling may be a bit better... but this would be very 
subtle or imagined on my part. I do not notice the ride being  more harsh, but  
since I was riding on essentially a metal-metal contact back, there this is 
not a suprise. When the suspension has settled they will do another weight/
balance and do the final adjustmnets.

Unfortunately, the banna arm bushings are also ready to be replaced. 
These can only be replaced with the engine out. Replacing these suspension 
bushings is another thing to add to your list of "stuff to do when the engine 
has to come out". In my case I'm not taking the engine out.

Replacing the torsion bar bushings is a nasty job, but after 25 years why not?

Bill
