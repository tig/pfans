I mount the Val1 in my 91 C4 directly under the mirror, with the top edge
of the locator parallel and just a touch above the lower edge of the
mirror, i.e. with the rear antenna just a hair below the lip of the mirror
and with a clear shot backwards between the seats but the bulk of the Val 1
blending into the mirror cluster.

As to power, I simply run the cord down to the lighter.  I had always
thought that I could run a flat transparent 4 wire phone cord straight up
from the mirror bracket to the headliner, essentially glued to the inside
of the windshield along the line of the in-glass antenna. It seemed that
this wouldn't be too obvious, and it positions the detector where I think
it operates best.  I assume there's power in the headliner for the dome
lights.  But, I've never actually done this yet.

Please let us know how it works out :")!
