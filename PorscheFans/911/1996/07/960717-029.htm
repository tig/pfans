I guess I read the initial inquiry somewhat differently.  I did not think
there was any insinuation of impropriety, but rather a comment on the
unanticipated fate of Porschephiles.

The Phund was established to offer some relief for the accumulated
burden of running Porschephiles.  There was never a statement of
purpose for the Phund.  In fact, it was boldly stated that Stan
could/should do whatever he wanted with the funds.  The Phund was
basically a gesture of Thanks from the Philes participants to Stan.

However, there was an "implied" sense that the Phund would be used to
ensure the longevity of Phorschephiles.  Since Porschephiles has since
died, I can understand someone wondering about it.  But technically,
we have no right to question it.  The contributions were Donations
with NO terms or conditions.

Keep Porsching,
