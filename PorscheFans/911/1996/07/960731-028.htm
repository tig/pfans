Yes, I've done rebuilds.  I have not yet had to replace the ring and pinion,
but will in fact be doing one shortly.  (You know who you are -- I'm waiting!)
It's a lot of work just to do a normal wear-and-tear rebuild: synchros and
seals.  It's going to be more work to do the ring and pinion because of the
set-up involved in locating (shimming) the pinion gear as well as the
differential.

Your friend may wish to consider simply swapping in a good used gearbox.  The
prices I've heard quoted on them are competitive with rebuilding.  Of course,
you don't get a fresh gearbox, you get a worn one.
