Greetings P-nuts,

Out surfing around again and found this little ditty below on the Porsche
page...though y'all might enjoy it.
A million cars...wow.  This is the same company that was real ready to
croak the 911 (back in the eighties? late seventies?) in favor of the 928,
back when E. Fuhrman was in charge**...but I guess Herr professor himself
thought better of THAT idea.  Much to our benefit, n'est-ce pas?

Cheers
Thom Kuby

**Pete A.(or anyone else), can you fill in the historical gaps here?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reno, Nevada, July 15, 1996 -- Porsche AG today produced its milestone
1,000,000th sports car. On hand for the momentous occasion at Porsche's
Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen assembly plant were Professor Ferry Porsche, the
honorary chairman of the supervisory board of Porsche AG, and Porsche AG
board chairman, Dr. Wendelin Wiedeking. They presented the historic car, a
police version of the 285-hp (DIN) Porsche 911, to the German state of
Baden-Wurttemberg, where it will be utilized by autobahn police.

Porsche AG has a long and proud tradition of designing and producing
high-performance vehicles exclusively for the sports car market. The first
sports car to carry the Porsche name, the Porsche 356,was built 48 years
ago in Austria. A total of 50 examples of this model were constructed
before the assembly facility was moved in 1950 to its current location in
the suburbs of Stuttgart. For the next 15 years, 77,000 Porsche 356s were
completed and delivered to customers in various markets around the world.

Numbering 419,000 units to date, the largest portion of Porsche's
million-car total is made up of the 911 and its derivatives. Originally
shown at the 1963 Frankfurt motor show, the legendary 911 retains its
popularity with the 1996 model lineup of today.

From 1969 to 1975, 118,000 Porsche 914 mid-engine cars were produced before
the series was replaced by the 924, Porsche's first front-engine
water-cooled model. Including its successors the 944 and 968, this car
accounted for 325,000 units over the next 20 years. Like the 914, for
capacity reasons these four-cylinder models were nearly all built at the
Audi factory in Neckarsulm.

Rounding out Porsche's million-car production total is the prestigious 928.
The only sports car of its time to be awarded the accolade of "Car of the
Year," the Porsche 928 was sold to 61,000 customers during its 1977 through
1995 manufacturing life.
