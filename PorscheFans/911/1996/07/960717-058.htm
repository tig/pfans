So my question is, DO I NEED A REBUILT PUMP?  If so, what do they cost (I've
heard numbers from $800 to $1500)?  Anybody have a candidate to rebuild the
pump or should I just go with the guy my mechanic typically uses (I don't 
know the guy's name)?  Is there anything for which I should watch-out during
this process?


Wade,

When the pump needs to be rebuilt the classic symptom is it runs too rich no 
matter what you do. Those who replied before made good suggestions. Here are 
some more. The driver's side heat exchager must not leak. There is a rather 
flimsy tube running from the heat exchanger up to the MFI unit used to sense 
the engine temp. If the heat exchanger is perforated the MFI can think the 
engine never gets hot and keep the mixture rich. Heat exchanger leaks are not 
always obvious. The tube should not leak either. The sensor disks up in the 
MFI unit can get dirty and sometimes they just need to be cleaned.

My MFI was rebuilt by a specialty shop in N.Y. state. I regret I forgot the 
name. Perhaps they advertise in Excellence or Pano. Anyway, they did an 
wonderful job on my MFI. When the MFI unit is right, and when the air stacks 
and linkage are properly adjusted, MFI is a real joy. The trouble is not too 
many people know how to set these things up these days.
