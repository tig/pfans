Hello,

My friend has an 89 C4, and while getting the valves adjusted
the mechanic told him his cams are pitted and need
replacement. He looked himself and sure enough they are
pitted somewhat. My cams on my '72 S are pitted too so
this question will help me also.

1. How necessary is it to replace the cams due to pitting?
Is it safe to run it this way for a while? Will anything else
(rockers) get damaged?

2. If he should replace them, he would like to get more
powerful cams, but of course does not want to lose any
bottom end power. He currently has the Autothority
chip and hot-wire intake mod (MAF?). Does GE or
anyone else make a good cam for this car with nearly
stock EFI? He's only driving it on the street so he does not
care about any racing class rules.

Thanks for any help!

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S
