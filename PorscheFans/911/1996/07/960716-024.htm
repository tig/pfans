On both my old '84 Carrera and present '95 993, I have run with the unit
mounted
either just below the mirror or between the mirror and the top of the
windshield.

For both cars, I fabricated a power lead from a 4-conductor straight phone
cord.
From the terminal connecting to the detector, measure out about 6-8", then
start
carefully stripping off the plastic covering/sheath around the wires.  Now,
trim
off the two extraneous wires (as I remember, ones you use are the red and
green 
wires - I believe all these harness colors are standard).  You now have two
very thin
wires that you can route and stuff under the rubber windshield molding until
you 
come to the dashboard.  On the Carrera, I routed the hot lead down into the 
defroster duct, drilled a small hole in the duct, then ran the wire to the
fuse panel
where I wired it in with a separate in-line fuse connected to one of the
screw-in
fuse connections receiving power only when the key is on.  The other end was 
terminated at a ground point in the passenger compartment.  On the 993, I ran

both wires alongside the dashboard/door junction, then routed them under the
dashboard.  On this car, I tapped into an open fuse circuit also powered only

when the power was on and added an in-line fuse.  The connection to the 
passenger compartment was made through a round rubber plug located above
the pedal box.   

Good luck!
