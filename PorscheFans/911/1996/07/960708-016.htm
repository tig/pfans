I fit fine in a 911, but I can't get close in a 944.  On the other hand, I
think we have different problems.  I'm long waisted (hence, short legged); 
in order to get close enough to the pedals to move a 944 I have to get my
head too close to the windshield.  How's *THAT* for a kick-in-the-head?  
I'm only 5'7" and I can't fit in someone's car!

On the other hand, a friend of a friend let me sit in his Testa Rossa (that's
the one spelled with two words: the old pontoon-fendered Ferrari).  Not only 
that, it was serial number one -- the prototype!  And it fit PERFECTLY.  Maybe 
I'll just have to own it someday =^>.
