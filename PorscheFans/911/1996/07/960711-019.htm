Yes,

How could unburned oil deposits make your valves work better? Additives could 
help valves but just long chain alphatic hydrocarbons? Aren't valve stems 
splash lubricated by engine oil (unless your valve guides are worn way bad and 
air spaces reduce lubrication and create hot spots)? The valve heads are not 
lubricated or you wouldn't your plugs foul sucking the oil into the cylinder 
and, blow lots of smoke out the exhaust side all the time? On the other hand, 
adding 10 to 20 ml of oil to 65 liters of fuel couldn't possibly accomplish 
very much at any rate.

Final comment-has this mechanic adjusted one too many MFI units via the "take 
a deep sniff" test?
