A couple notes on the numerical oil temp gauges:

Performance sells the same kit for $80 and Imparts for $50
but they were out of stock last month when I wanted one.
After a little whining, Performance matched Impart's price.

The install is simple.  The senders swap with a 17mm wrench
and it took me longer to label all the wires on the temp/pressure
cluster than it did to unscrew the old meter and screw in the
new one.

As for the old gauge it is calibrated (in celsius) way-way-way
over on the left hand side.  And you can check its accuracy in
boiling water.  But even after doing both I switched to the numeric
gauge for the convenience.
