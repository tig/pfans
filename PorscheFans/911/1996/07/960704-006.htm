The microswitch you're talking about is used in conjuntion with the rpm 
sensor (which is in the electrical equipment "bay" on the left side of the 
engine compartment), and the MFI pump shut-off solenoid (which is 
mounted on the front of the pump).  The idea of the system is to shut off gas 
to the MFI pump when you let up on the gas when at speed, but to allow gas 
to go to the pump if you let up on the gas when standing still, i.e., when 
idling.  The system works as follows.

The rpm sensor outputs 12 volts whenever the engine is above about 1500 
rpm, and 0 volts otherwise.  This signal goes through the microswitch to the 
shut-off solenoid. If you're above 1500 rpm and your foot is off the gas, like 
when you let up on the acclerator at speed, the switch is turned on and the 
solenoid is activated.  No gas to the pump.  As soon as you step on the pedal, 
the switch is turned off, the solenoid is deactivated and away you go.  If you're 
below 1500 rpm, like at idle, there is no 12 volts signal so the pump continues 
to get gas.  If the system is working, you'll notice many fewer backfires at 
speed whn letting up on the gas.
