Michael:

Did you rebuild both front calipers at the same time? If you didn't, you
should have.  The new caliper piston seals are very aggressive and return the
pistons back more than an older caliper.  You should rebuild both calipers on
the front or rear on any car at the same time. 

The other thing that happens, quite often, is that the pistons in the
calipers either rotate or are installed wrong.  This will cause the problem
that you describe every time.  The pistons have a cut out area on the face
that touches the brake pad and this location in relationship to the caliper
is very important.  This cutout must face the rotor turning direction at 30
degrees.  If you didn't observe this, you will need to rotate the pistons.  

This is a little bit hard to describe on how to do it adn better done by a
picture or by drawing, so before we attempt to go any farther, were you aware
of this and did you do it correctly?
