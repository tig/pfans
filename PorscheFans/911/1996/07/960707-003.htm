Now here's a detail question for a 911 guru...

The engine is a late 2.7L 911, with the 7R case and the final oiling system
.... uses the same plungers and springs for the pressure relief and bypass
valves.  

However, I didn't notice that the plugs that screw in to tension the springs
against the plungers are different from eachother.  One is slightly smaller
in diameter, and has a ring (or shallow groove) machined around the
circumference of its head.  This one also has a slightly shallower
counterbore where the pressure spring seats, so that it preloads the plunger
more than the plug with a plain head.

Questions are as follows:

1. Which valve is for oil pressure relief (ie: the one that sets sytem oil
pressure) ? ... is it the one on the bottom surface of the crankcase, or is
it the one on the left side vertical face of the case?  I can't make it out
from the lubrication diagram in the manual....

2. Which location does the plug with the *ring* go into?  ... does it go
into the bottom of the case, or into the hole in the vertical face?  

I took an educated guess, and put the ringed plug on the left/vertical side,
since the boss in the crankcase seems to better match its diameter ...
However with this choice, the plain headed plug in the bottom of the
crankcase does not preload its plunger much at all, while the one on the
side of the case (ie: the ringed one) is pre-loaded a *lot*, and is a bugger
to get started in the thread. From this point of view, the plain plug would
be better fitted up on the side of the case, and vice-versa.

Which location is correct for which plug?

Many thanks,
....Gregg
