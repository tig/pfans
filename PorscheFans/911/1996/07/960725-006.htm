OK -- so I've placed new valve guides, reseated the valves, and rejetted
the carbs, running hot plugs. Taken the Orange Monster to the garage to get
computer results and -- runs like caca -- emissions too high. Now the
mechanic wants (me) to buy a cat-conv. and build an exhaust system around
it (can you say BIG $$$) to get the beast passed by BAR.

I've made quite a few mistakes:

1) took the car to BAR instead of greasing a SMOG monkey's palm

2) had back surgery so I couldn't do any wrenching

3) got some paper exemption from the 'Parts Locator' that only lasts 90 days

4)  trusted a 'reputable' mechanic <-- I must admit he does do work I'd be
proud of -- it's like a new engine -- purrs like a kitten, roars like a
lion and extremely clean -- important to us girls 8-.). It's the
principle...

How can I tell the mechanic I really don't want to purchase a $250.00 cat.
conv. (highway robbery? -- not including the specially made exhaust
system!)  to use every two years (even tho he's done a bunch of 'free' work
rejetting and setup, placing some hokey can w/cat. conv. -- only to no
avail) --  yet I want the car to pass -- or

what can I do to get it to pass? I can't try the greasin' palm thing now
cuz once you go to BAR you must return to pass or they know somethun's
fishy.

This is the kind of thing that's made my SO say, " when you get the
certificate, quick sell the car during the 60 day grace period." I don't
want to sell my happy puppy 8-.(

HELP!!!!   please reply directly (and post to list) as I'm digest and won't
receive until too late to stop mechanic.

All TIA
