Wait a minute, you want to get RID of this? Most people just PAINT flames on
their car 'cause they don't know how to make real ones. Hey, if you find out
what causes this, tell the rest of us so we can rig our cars the same way. 

Actually, my 356 does balls of red flames on engine braking from high revs. I
can help the process by cutting the ignition switch for a second or two, then
turning it on again. Very impressive when friends are following. I keep
meaning to do this when coasting through the immigration checkpoint on
Interstate 5 about 50 miles N of San Diego, but never quite seem to get
around to it... Damn immigration wannabe cops would probably think they're
under fire and shoot back. Or start a high-speed chase so they can be on the
evening news. ILLEGAL ALIEN FROM GERMANY APPREHENDED AFTER HIGH SPEED CHASE
IN PORSCHE reaching speeds up to 80 mph (and by the way 14 innocent
bystanders run over by immigration officers but that's the price of freedom)
FILM AT 11.

Seriously, I don't know if your flames are bad, I tend to think that if the
muffler hasn't blown up yet, it won't matter.
