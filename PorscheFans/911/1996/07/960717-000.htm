Mike,

I also have a 73 911T that I primarily use for track events.  For my 
street wheels I have the stock 15X6 front and rear with a 205/60 on 
them.  My Track wheels are stock 15x6 on the front and 911R 15x7 on the 
rear.  I run 205/50 and 225/50 Yoko 008RS tires.  The original owner 
blistered the paint on the left rear fender using a standard 15x7.  That 
was when he switched to the 911R offset for the rears.  I have not had 
any problems with clearance using those wheels.  The only problem is, 
those wheels are far and few between, and the cost proves it.  If you 
are interested, I think I know someone that has a pair they would be 
willing to sell.  If you can get the proper offset, you might be able to 
get an aftermarket wheel that fits.
