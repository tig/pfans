I have a question on regulator/alternator matching. But I want to give you a
little history on why I am asking the question.

On a trip up to a Zone 8 Concours in Central California a couple years ago.
My 70 911 Euro E had a major failure of the alternator, regulator and a
couple fried batteries.

The fellow who was able to help me, in Los Osos, was able to conjure up an
older Bosch alternator and a regulator to match it. It was not the same as
the Motorla alternator and Marchal regulator that came with the car
orginally, but it did the job and I was able to get home. 

Recently I noticed I was having the very faint charging light come on at
night. So we tested the charging system and lo and behold "something" wasn't
up to snuff. I wanted to change out the Bosch regulator for the Marchal type
again, as I am showing the car in the Parade Concours. When we discovered the
Bosch regulator was the problem, we rewired and installed the Marchal
regulator. The charging system was happy again and no more light when you
turn on all the elctrical "stuff".

Now after all that, is it a problem to run the Bosch alternator with the
Marchal regulator? There is a question amongst some of us if the Bosch unit
can co-exsist with the M regulator. I have put only 50 miles on the car since
we did the regulator switch.

I have to travel up to Central California for the Zone 8 Concours next
weekend. It is about 300 miles from home and obviously I do not want to have
a problem with the charging system again.

I had the Motorola rebuilt. But the consensous was if the Marchal regulator
will work with the Bosch alternator, I do not have to pull the fan out. I
only have a couple days left before I leave and fan pulling is not fun :)

Any thoughts?


Thanks in advance for the input
