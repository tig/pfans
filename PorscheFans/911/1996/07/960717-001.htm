Sorry if this is against policy but I thought you might be able to help
this guy out.  We have the car that he is talking about but we do not
regularly drive it so are unaware. 

77-924
87-turbo look cabriolet

BTW his adress is at the bottom

Later

I'm seriously considering purchasing an '87 - '89 range 911
Carrera (not turbo).  One part of the decision is getting a
reasonable estimate of maintenance costs and how often it
needs to be in the shop.  I have looked through a wonderfully
useful book, _The Used 911 Story_ by Peter Zimmerman, which
goes through 911 history year by year with his own experiences
as a mechanic in Southern Calif, and he really highlights the
'88 and '89 Carreras as highly reliable cars (at least for
Porsche standards! :-).  I'm including '87 in my time range
because changes from'87 to '88 were very minor.

What I don't have a feeling for is, does "highly reliable" mean
a budget of $1k/year, $2k/year, $5k/year for maintenance?  Work on
it every weekend, or just bring it in every 3 months?  I would
definitely want to keep it in top shape, will do the necessary
work up front to make sure it's not a lemon (thorough checkout
by Porsche mechanic), and take it to a well-regarded Porsche
specialty mechanic for service.

Also, any real-life experiences, good or bad, with this
year range Carreras would be appreciated.

If I get requests to summarize the info I receive, I'll do that
as a return service in the Usenet tradition!

Thanks for any help,
