Something to check is the operation of your radiator fans.

1.  Both should be running at low speed when the temp guage indicates around 
the middle.  If only one is running at high speed, you have a blown fuse on 
the dead fan or some other break in the circuit or a dead motor.  The fan 
relay is smart enough to run the single fan at high speed when the other is 
dead to keep some cooling capacity.  I found this out a few weeks ago 
when a fuse blew for no apparent reason on the passenger side fan.  It 
has held fine since, and it was 95 degrees today here in Eugene, OR.

2.  Both fans should be running at high speed when the guage indicates 
close to the second mark (they do on my car).

It sounds like the system is doing its job (especially on a 110 degree 
day with the AC on!) and the 944 runs hot enough as it is.  The owner's 
manual says the needle may reach the upper field (red) under high load, but 
should return to the center area when the load is reduced.  I have the 
stock radiator switch and thermostat.
