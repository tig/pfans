Chris:

This is one of the deep dark secrets of the Porsche world.  Normally if I
told you this I'd have to kill you, but since I know that no one else is
going to read this, I guess it is O.K. this one time.  

The rubber bushings compress from the weight of the car.  The rubbing will
always be on the bottom part of the torsion bar.  It gets worse with larger
torsion bars.  It is usually the squeak that occurs in the front of a 911
that makes them sound like a old baby buggy.  People think that the squeak is
the shocks and replace them, only to still have this really high pitched
squeak.  

The solution is really easy.  The torsion bar cap that fits into the cross
member has a whole bunch of up and down slop.  What you do is to throw a bead
of weld onto the bottom edge of this part and then grind it down until it
just fits back into the cross member.  This will force the torsion bar up and
to the center of the hole in the cross member and the "A' arm.  No more
problems.

Not sure what to tell you about lubrication.  Hope you didn't remove the
rubber part off of the "A" arm.  This is going to be tough to put back
together if you did.  I am assuming that you are replacing the bushing with
some other material?  Let me know.

Now remember, I've given you this information with the thought that you won't
tell anybody else.
