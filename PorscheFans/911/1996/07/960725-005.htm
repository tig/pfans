Just to add my $0.02 to the A/C discussions....I am in the process of 
adding A/C to my 911, seems like the S.O. would like to have some cold air 
inside. I have been checking around, and tend to agree that the R134 
solution may not be the unique solution in the future, but there is no 
penalty for upgrading (if you have to anyway) to parts which are R134a 
compliant.

I have been looking at an outfit called Vintage Air (10305 I.H. 35 North, 
San Antonio, Texas, 78233) and so far have been quite impressed. The owners 
have written a book called "How to Air Condition Your Car", available 
through Classic Motorbooks which is quite good. They also sell the full 
range if stuff for A/C including expansion valves for both R12 and R134, 
hose, fittings and compressors. Some of their prices seem pretty good, like 
a Sanden (Sankyo) 508 compressor, which from what I can gather is the one 
normally used by folks like Automotion as the upgrade for $199. They also 
sell a 505 (slightly smaller compressor) which is the one I will be using.

Their target audience is the traditional American hot rod, eg the 57 Chevy 
type, but A/C is A/C....

I will keep you all informed as I learn more.....FWIW
