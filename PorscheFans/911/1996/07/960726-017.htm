Hi,

Bob Spindel sent me a very useful note on body flex checking, in
reply to my question. With his OK, copy forwarded to the list.

This suggests another "old wives" test for a car thing -

The "Tylenol test" for body flex. Insert a tylenol (or an
OrudisKT if your door really fits closely :), in the gap above
the door, and tape it in. If it gets crushed in a test drive,
then the body flexed.  Also can be used with the "Dave Darling
914 flex test" mode, with a 914 sitting in the driveway :-)
(cf.  Porschephiles archives).

Right up there in the collection with the "Lincoln Head test",
using a Lincoln penny to measure tread depth, and to check
evenness of tyrewear.

Or the "Chalk Mark test", marking chalk on the sidewall, to
check for correct hot inflation pressure during an autocross.

And of course, the other recent thing we learnt over there in
the 924-944 list -- the "Burp Bottle test", hang a soda bottle
to the coolant overflow line, dont shut off engine after
stopping, and check bottle. Overflow --> possible head gasket
time.
