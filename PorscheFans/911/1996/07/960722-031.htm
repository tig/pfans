Hi all,

First my thanks to Kevin Gross, Gregg Kricorissian, Bruce Anderson,
Craig Laughlin ... for your quick replies, they were most useful.

Well, I went and checked out the car. In brief, 
+-----------
+  '74 911S, 2.7 stock motor.  Neat, nothing suspicious.
+   95K miles, never lugged, never high rpms, not rebuild.
+   It does have the updated 11-blade fan, 
+   But no T-fittings on the oil lines, ergo not carrera tensioners.
+   (Stickers on car) VIN 9114101983 12/73, Chassis: Kunstharzlack 334-9 3
+   Stock black alloy wheels, matched 195-65-R15 set.
+   Owner almost single owner (since 100 miles)
+-----------

The guy seemed responsible, sincere and honest, was forthcoming with
stuff about the car, even drew my attention to spots of rust I might
have missed.  Sadly, he never kept records. Has owned the car since its
first 100 miles, and has driven it only on western mass roads -- ie.
not bad bad boston stop-and-go traffic. 95K miles.  Never rebuilt.
Life and familiy has gotten too busy to enjoy his "porsh", so would
like to sell.  He dislikes "oil additives and junk like that" too
(cool!).

Questions:

1. My main plans for this car is to let me find out what this
"autocross thing" is all about, maybe in what is left yet of this
season :) So the plan is to buy a car that is OK enough, and just
update tensioners right away and struts if need be. I can afford to do
a pre-emptive top-end rebuild sometime if need be.

That the car has no A/C or CD, and no show spoilers and show wings and
other junk (I dont feel any inadequacies in me that I need my car to
mask :-), and is bone-stock original steel-work -- all this is a great
plus!

2. Of course, there is some rust. (Not unless you really looked, will
still impress the neighbours as is, for what that is worth :-)

   a. Driver side door sill, at the very rear end, a 1in square hole
   b. Bubbles under paint, one on edge of hood and one on rear right
      quarterpanel. Total two. Each the size of a quarter.

No rust at all that I could see anywhere on the underpan, undercoating
seems clean and continuous.  No rust in battery compartment.
Suspensions seemed solid -- the usual "bounce the bumper" test was no
use :-), as it should be with strongly suspended P-cars.

+---------------
Question is : how can I quantitatively check for body flex and
structural strength, which is only worry now in terms of rust.
+---------------

Searching (with my 'qlutch' search engine) over the pfiles ..

Mentions jacking up the rear end of a targa, and checking fit of doors
to check for flex. There is also the famous Dave Darling test for
914s.

+---------------
Can I do something like this in a coupe ? Can I
tape-measure the flex to determine body condition ?
+---------------

One of the reasons I am looking for a test like that is that the car
has been repainted. The repaint was $1500 several years ago, not too
recent.  So I dont think the repaint was an effort to conceal any major
body problems, but still I have to confirm that definitively.

+---------------
3. Where can I find option code stickers on a '74 911 ?
   Engine block/case numbers ? Other numbers ?
   Anyone have the 911 and Porsche-general FAQs ?
+---------------
   So next time I go to see the car, I can copy down more numbers.


Next steps ...

1. Buy Bruce Anderson (the book!, I dont think I can offord the whole
person!! :-) ... special order with local bookstore in process.
2. Get car re-registered, drive to Porsche wrench for compression, leak
down, and head-end check-out. Also, suspensions, steering, body work.
3. Update to Carrera tensioners.
4. Lookup next autocross event in the area :)

Man, the 911 engine area is so much neater and uncluttered than any
front-engined car I have ever popped the hood of !! I wont mind
continuing to shop for 911s just for a chance to look inside them :)
But then if I have one in my drive ....  hmm!
