  OFFICE MEMO          Snow Tires                             Date:7/16/96

I must defer from Paul Allen's recommendation of Goodyear GW snow tires.  The
prevailing feeling around here is that Bridgestone Blizzacks are a much better
tire, particularly for a Porsche.  However, if you really want a killer of a
snow tire (off the old Porschephile List from Mike):

"Nokia makes 3 tires worth considering:

Hakkapolitta NR09 -- a older tire, excellent in snow but noisy
Hakkapolitta NR10 (or just Hakkapolitta 10)
                  -- newer design, excellent in snow, slightly quieter
                     not available in certain sizes (but the NR09 generally
                     is available in these sizes, which are usually narrower
                     tires for older European cars.)
Nokia NRW -- "all season"; not as aggressive as the NR09 or 10,
                     and reportedly more pleasant on dry pavement.  Far
                     better than most tires labeled "all season" from what
                     I hear.

Greer Enterprises in WI 414-747-0996

Pat Greer seems like a very nice guy and his prices are quite good.  I
paid $77/tire including shipping for a pair of 185/65R14s and $73/tire
including shipping for a set of 185/65R15s back in December.
Mike"

Friends in Wis. and Minn. (where people know something about driving in the
snow) say very good things about Hakkapolittas.
