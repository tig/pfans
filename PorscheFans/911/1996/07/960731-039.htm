Okay PCA Club Racers, listen up.

The Portland race is coming up in just over 3 weeks on August 24-25. I have
not seen as many registration forms as I had expected. Where are you
racers?!? Perhaps you're confused on where Portland, Oregon is located. Let
me help:

We are up here in the upper left corner....well almost in the corner. That
one in the corner is Washington, we're just below it. It's our job to keep
California from rubbing against Washington.

Maybe you don't want to leave the US in this time of terrorism.
Understandable. Well, truth be told, we are actually part of the US although
one really good earthquake and we could be an independent island nation off
the coast of Idaho.

Perhaps you didn't know we race up here in the woods. Well we do, in fact we
have a world class race circuit, Portland International Raceway, within our
city limits. Really. PIR is a city park and is located only 10 minutes from
downtown. The race course is surrounded by manicured lawns. If you overcook
it and run off the course, it's just a spin around the park.

Or maybe it's the fact that you let the registration cutoff date (July 31)
slip by and now you don't want to spend the extra $50 (to race your $150,000
twin turbo). Well email me back telling me your dog ate your registration
forms and I will waive the $50 late fee. Really.

So this is it folks....last call!!!
