Hi again!  Just some interesting points on lightened components.

I have a 69 912 that I race, the flywheel has been lightened by at least   
6lbs, clutch lightened 4lbs, the crank has been lightened by 4lbs, the   
rods lightened as much as possible, lightest Shasta pistons I could get,   
light wristpins etc.

This makes for a fairly snappy engine but no probs with stalling.
Now the engine is only 1700cc so the lightening will have maximum effect.   
 A light flywheel on a 3.6 where the crank weighs more than my whole   
engine should have only a tiny effect.  ( I'm just trying to stress a   
point not throw a Tomatoe!)

And why lighten?  It is just easier on the engine, will make it last   
longer at the insane RPM we put them through!  Acceleration is not   
noticably increased (again the mass of the flywheel vs the mass of the   
car).  Yes shifting is a little quicker.  The BIG effect though on my   
engine is coming off the line.  Because there is little mass and thus   
little energy spinning to transfer to the clutch the car will not come   
off the line.  In just street driving I have to come off the line at at   
least 4000rpm or really put my foot in it at less rpm.  So either you bog   
it off the line or you smoke the tires!  (Just like those F1 guys in the   
pits!)  A big engine like a 3.6 will have enough torque that you won't   
have that problem.

A guess at the stall problems:  Normally when you come off the throttle   
the mass of the engine spinning is enough to force air passed the   
throttle body and the DME manages it like it does any other mixture.   
 With a lighter flywheel there will be less air pulled by the throttle   
body and the DME will cut fuel (but the revs are still up so the idle   
circuit has not been engaged) since the DME has cut fuel, and the engine   
is pulling less air, the engine is litterally shut off before the revs   
have come down to idle range.  By the time the revs reach idle range for   
the idle circuit to come in the engine is too far gone, starved for fuel.
The reason this does not happed on a carbed engine is that the idle   
bypass is able to pull air and fuel even with the butterfly closed(   
although way too rich ).
The polution control solution for this was the throttle valve compensator   
which was tied in to the throttle linkage and actually closed the   
throttle less abruptly if the revs were still up.

Again all a guess but fun to think about!
