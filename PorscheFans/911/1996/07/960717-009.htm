In your case it measures torque at the rear wheels. It does this by applying
a load on the rollers under the tires, such as by running a big water pump or
electrical generator, to counteract the force the tires are exerting on the
roller. Knowing rpm, this gives you horsepower at the rear wheels. That's
called a chassis dyno. If you bolt the engine to a bench that is able to put
a load on the engine while it is running, to measure how much force it takes
to counteract the "twisting force" at the end of the crankshaft, it's called
an engine dyno. Same idea, just different hardware to accomodate just an
engine or complete car as case may be.

I worked as an engineer at Bosch on diesel injection pumps for 4 years. The
old mechanical gasoline pumps are similar in concept to the diesels, but they
have internal parts to keep gas and pump oil separate, and the governors work
on a different principle. There aren't too many people who know what the hell
they are doing with gasoline mechanical injection pumps. Probably less than
half a dozen in the country. There are quite a few more diesel pump mechanics
but not many gasoline pump mechanics. And the pumps are different enough that
even the most knowledgeable diesel mechanic won't have the stuff he needs to
do a gas pump right. They need different test fluid in the test bench when
they are set up, for one thing. 

BTW the basic design of the gasoline pump goes back at least to the pump used
on the Daimler-Benz DB 601 aircraft engine, as used in the Messerschmitt
Bf-109 and other airplanes of the Second Worldwide Unpleasantness. We had a
cutaway pump from a DB-601 at Bosch. One day some airline pilot from
California called to get parts, seems he was restoring a Messerschmitt. I
think Germany was eventually able to make parts for him.

Recommendations -- there are a couple or three shops I've heard good things
about. Pacific Fuel Injection is supposed to be good. They're in Burlingame,
CA, in the Bay Area. 1-415-342-5536. 

Bev Frohm, past president of PCA Orange Coast Region and a member of this
forum, has a few recommendations for pump shops but I didn't write them down.
I'm ccing this message to her, hopefully she'll post her favorite pump shops.
