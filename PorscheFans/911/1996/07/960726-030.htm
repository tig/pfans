>Subject: E36 M3 for sale - excellent price
>
>A friend wants to sell his 95 M3 (daytona violet) for $25K.  The car is
>11 months old with 10K miles and is in excellent condition (I've seen
>it...all I could see was 1 rock chip next to the grill).  Car is stock
>and has never been on a track.  I would buy this car but I can't afford
>another M3.
>
>Here's the catch....he has to leave the country (US) by this sunday and
>he wants to sell by then.  Car is in Seattle, WA.  So you'll probably
>have to fly out to close the deal.
>
>He also has a 92 Red NSX ($25K) and a 95 Silver 993 ($45K)...if you're
>interested.
