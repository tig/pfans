At what speeds are valve stem supports a really good idea?  Someone on
PorscheFans recently and whimsically (I think) suggested that the cutsie
metal Porsche valve caps add major force (is it "weight" that's added?) to
the stem at higher speeds.  It makes sense, but is this force worth worrying
about?  Obviously one can exclude those weighty affectations or put on valve
stem supports.  

BUT, MORE GENERALLY, AT WHAT SPEEDS ARE VALVE SUPPORTS A FUNCTIONALLY
EFFECTIVE OPTION?  OR, IS THIS (STEM SUPPORTS) ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
OVERREACTION AND MARKETING?  ANY OF YOU ENGINEERING TYPES WILLING TO
CALCULATE THE FORCE OF A PLASTIC VALVE CAP (WHAT IS IT, MAYBE 1 OR 2 GRAMS?)
AND I SUPPOSE THE WEIGHT OF THE VALVE AND STEM ASSEMBLY, ON ITSELF, ON SAY A
225-50/16 WHEEL AND TIRE GOING 100, 110, 120, ETC. MPH? 

I must have too much time on my hands.
