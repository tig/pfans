Bruce, I wonder if you can look into 993 leaks a little more. Mine 
was delivered with a nasty one, caused by a cracked timing change 
cover. My dealer tells me that half a dozen 1996 993's he's delivered 
have oil leaks. So far no pattern has emerged (one delaer only) but 
the cures involved replacing various gaskets, oil seals and in one 
instance the main case! I'm watching my engine still because while 
installing the springs I found drops of oil on the drivers side front 
end of the motor!

He further reported that he didn't have this problem with any of the 
993's he delivered in 1994 and 95. So the one posted to the list 
would seem to be an isolated instance (bleep happens). 

Now for my question: I used H and R springs to lower my C4S. Oliver 
at performance products suggested the 993-turbo springs as ideal for 
my M030 (Sports Chassis) equipped car. He was right. The springs were 
easy to install and required only a half inch adjustment of the front 
spring perches to get reasonable ground clearance.  The ride is a 
little stiffer than stock but quite acceptable. Now at Euro height, 
the car looks great. I'll tell you about the dynamics in ten days 
after the track event.

I also know that 911's should be set nose down. I'll do this when I 
realign in a month (to allow for initial sag).  I figure to use a 
camber guage along the door sill to set "x" degrees of nose down 
attitude. Alternately measure from the top of the fender wells front 
and back. Right now I have all four corners at 25 1/4" as measured 
from the fender lips. 

While I can set the front to be 1.5 inches lower than the rear, I 
can't go nuts because speed bumps will eat my front air dam. Any 
suggestions on what downtilt if any is right for a C4S?

Bob
