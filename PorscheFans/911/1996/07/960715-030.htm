Well, looks like it's time to replace my battery.  I've currently got a 
Powertron that was installed by a certain Porsche A_____e Scumbag shop in 
Charlotte (I'll let you figure out who that is, Charlatans) in 10/92.  
It's got a 50 month warrantee, so I've got about 5 months left on it, 
which is probably worth $2.95 in exchange value, but I'm not sure, since 
Powertron's 800 number is not open on weekends, which probably means it 
is NOT Interstate's offbrand, which is what some People Always Stealing 
told me.  Anyway, to the point, what could I replace it with, other than 
Interstate, which I'd prefer to do.  Are there any deals at places like 
Sears and such?  Or should I stick with Interstate?  Or does anybody know 
who Powertron really is?  If the price difference isn't so great, and 
Powertron doesn't uphold their warrantees, I'll prbably go with 
Interstate.  I just hope I can eke enough life out of this battery to 
make the 4 hour trip to Columbia tomorrow, where I'm moving.

Reasons I think battery is failing: goes dead after a few days, usually 
after sitting for a while.  Dies quickly if I leave the lights on.  
Charging system seems fine according to voltmeter.  Will try using one of 
those $3 hydrometers to test, but how useful are they really?  Can they 
tell me if the battery is having trouble holding a charge over a period 
of time?
