Mike, I can't comment on what other organizations do, but our policy is
that EVERY student gets an instructor, and therefore if your car is going
to carry two people, equal seating is mandatory. This came about when
some student's cars came to an event with race style driver's seat and
5/6 point harness, while the passenger (i.e., instructor) had to make do
with a stock seat and factory 3-point harness.  Our policy is that the person

in the passenger seat should get the same high quality of safety equipment
as the driver.  I don't know what the rules are with the organization you
run with, so I might suggest contacting them prior to running.  All of  the
Porsche Club regions I have run with send out a tech form of items to comply
with prior to coming to an event, and you can always ask prior to sending in
your application and money. I believe the equal-restraint rule is pretty much
universal up here (PA/OH) if you intend to have someone in the passenger
seat.

Hey,

Does this "equal seating and restraints for driver and passenger" apply
at all driver's eds?  I have a 5-point harness in my car now, but only for
me.
I am also looking into putting in a cage and possibly getting a racing seat.
For obvious reasons ($$$), I hadn't planned on buying *two* seats and
*another* harness, however I plan to continue doing driver's ed events
(at my "home" track, I don't have a need for anyone to ride with me, but
will at other tracks, most likely).

Am I shooting myself in the foot if I don't get two of everything?
