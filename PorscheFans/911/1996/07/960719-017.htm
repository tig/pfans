Hi,

Previously, I had posted a request for suggestions regarding a hot 
starting problem that I was having with my '86 911.  Well, that problem 
subsequently developed into a fullblown dead car.  I traced the problem 
to a dead ignition system and, after having the car towed to my trusty 
mechanic, we discovered that the DME computer was the culprit.

	We replaced my computer with a known good computer and, presto, 
the engine ran like new.  Substituting my computer back into the loop 
and, SURPRISE, the car STILL runs fine!

	So, here's my question:  Does anybody here know of a facility 
that repairs/diagnoses DME Computer problems?  

I am fairly certain that what I have is a faulty soldier connection 
somewhere in the DME, but lack the knowledge/experience to go about 
troubleshooting this on my own, and don't want to have to spend the 
$1,100+ for a rebuilt computer.  (btw, is this a reasonable price?)

Thanks for your time

Feel free to email me directly (and/or post to the list)

Thanks, 

Darrin (gonzo@nmaa.org)
