Hi P-Fans,

My 84 Carrera recently decided to tangle its wipers.  Thankfully, it was 
not in a rainstorm.  I was just trying to clear my windshield of some 
road film.  The accessibility of this assembly leave a lot to be desired, 
so I have some questions for those of you unfortunate enough to have this 
experience.

1)  Is this most easily accessible by removing the dash an doing the work 
      from the inside?

2) Are there parts of the assembly available from the dealer  =8-O  or 
     must  I buy the whole assembly?

The problem is a press-fit bushing that has come out of its hole.  I can 
see it and touch it but there is no room to work (drill, hammer, braze) 
on it .  Please don't tell me that the heater/a/c unit has to be removed!

TIA,

-Bill Tomko
 84 Carrera
