Hi P-fans,

My car is on jackstands for service in the garage and this is one of the 
items that I was going to attend to.  After installing the factory short 
shift kit and new bushings, I noticed that the car would hang in 5th.  
To free it, a light push forward was required immediately prior to 
pulling it down into 4th or neutral.  I have never nicked any gear since 
the installation of the kit.  

With the original shifter, my wife could not put the car into 2nd gear.
She had the seat pulled just far enough forward that the travel of the 
lever was limited and 2nd could not be engaged.  We had several heated 
"discussions" about her technique before the cause was evident.  (I got
in the driver's seat right after one of these discussions without moving 
the seat into my usual position and repeated her performance).  Time to 
eat a little crow.  Oh well, that problem was solved.

Is there anyone who has tinkered around (successfully) with the factory 
kit to alleviate this minor nit?  

My only sore spot relates to another thread--the removal of the shift 
knob from the old lever, which I couldn't.  I decided I would rather have 
the old lever/knob for a back-up and just buy a new knob.  Only added 
another $60 to the job.  Still preferable to the glue on type IMHO.

YMMV etc.
