Bleed air as someone else has suggested, although this ought not be a problem
with a new car.  There was a 944-series problem with high spots in the feed
hose from the reservoir to the master, which apparently let air accumulate
and get bled into the MC.  I'd look for this on the 993.

I would also check the free travel of the MC rod.  I saw another 911 not too
long ago with a similar problem.  The rod was off centre and was getting
cocked as it entered the MC.  I believe the symptoms were multiple MC
replacements because of repeated failure.  The failure was probably leaking
past the cup seal; I forget the details...

Check also the helper spring and the rest of the linkage.
