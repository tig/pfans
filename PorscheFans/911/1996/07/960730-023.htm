Hi Rob and phans-
    I've also been following the thread on LSDs and thought I'd throw my
$.02 in.  Factory limited slips are somewhat harder to find than a Quaiffe,
but they can be found for roughly $600 dollars.  Just need to call around
(Vertex, PAP, Aase Bros., etc.).  

    I'm  currently in the process of changing transmissions in my 79 SC to a
72 915 tranny for the shorter gearing (7:31 vs 8:31), plus adding a factory
LSD.  After talking with a few track junkies, this seems to be the setup for
people on a somewhat limited budget.  You might get lucky and find someone
who has already done this.  I've run across a couple in the last year that
were priced around $2000, but decided to piece it together myself.  I've
also seen where people are setting them up for 80% lockup, but the factory
manuals don't give you a clue as to setting them up for 80% lockup.  This
question came up a while back on P'philes, but I never saw an answer.  Maybe
Greg or Bruce could answer this.

Good luck with your quest.
