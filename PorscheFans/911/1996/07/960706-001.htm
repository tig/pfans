  I've got a couple of comments. If you're worried about headroom try the
targa first. The sunroof takes out at least an inch while the targa seems
like it adds a small amount over the regular coupe. I know about this problem
because I'm 6'1" and have a 79 sunroof coupe. I'm also longer than average
from the waist up which just complicates things more. If I put a helmet on I
had to tilt  my head, lean back so far I couldn't grasp the top of the
steering wheel or stick my helmet through the sunroof. I ended up buying a
Recaro and , cutting out my seat rails, and bolting the adapter to the floor.
The adapter retained the adjustability of the sliding rails. I now have
enough headroom (barely) to drive with a helmet on. This would be easier to
fit with the stock seat as it is not as wide as the Recaro. 
   Some purists may cringe at the thought of cutting out seat rails but I say
"Buy a car and make it Yours." Just enjoy it . That's what they were made
for. I figure I can sell mine to another tall person that needs headroom or
maybe a short person that wants a lower center of gravity.  ;-)
FWIW
