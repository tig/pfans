>Hi Jay
This is my third season of driver ed so I've begun to race a bit as I noted
earlier.
I have added extra cooling for the brakes and oil cooler, an external
cutoff switch and fire extinguisher.. Also, a roll cage. I still have stock
seats but use a five point harness and hold it in place with a leather
fitting that goes over the seat back and has slots for the shoulder
straps.I can tell you who makes these and I prefer it to a bar The other
points are fixed to the back seat belt positions. (The cage has eliminated
the sun visors and the side pockets.)
After trying several types I use Pagid brakes..they beat everything else in
my book, and last.
Thats all I've done so far, plus a K&N filter, and Red Line oils and I run
slow in races.(part of which is me I'm sure, even though I also went to a
Bondurant 4 -day school!) I have R-1 tires for the track, and the cage
makes it a bit difficult to get in and out but I use it daily to work and
its OK.
I am about to lower the car and get stiffer sway bars  as a first step in
trying to improve track performance.
You can easily find a set of wheels through the ads in Panorama. I have
found two sets that way, both for less than $500 for all four.But I didn't
think carefully enough and now I will want to got to wider and taller
wheels  (7x17 front and 9x17 rear are allowed in my racing class)
I put my money in safety first and I'm just starting on the performance. In
addition to the car , I have a racing suit.
Be careful of after market stuff...its often junk
Sorry to ramble ...but if you need more details on anything here just ask
Racing is great, but take your time ;its scary in the corners when there is
one person on each side passing you!!
HOPE To see you AT THE TRACK ONE DAY...WHAT REGION ARE YOU FROM?.
