Use as short an extension as possible.  I'd avoid joints if you can, they only
make it easier to cross-thread the spark plug going in, and they definitely
muddy the feel as you try to start the threads.

My personal weapon of choice for a 911 engine is a miniature Snap-On 3/8"
ratchet, the smallest extension in my set (maybe 1"?), and a double-jointed
Snap-On spark plug socket.  Yep, I'm not crazy about item #3, and would
rather be using a straight socket with a slightly longer extension.  The
socket, like most, has a rubber insert which does a good job of grabbing
the plug.
