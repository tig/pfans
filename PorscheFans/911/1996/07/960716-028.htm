I have a 1973 911S -- with mechanical fuel injection.  I may need a rebuild
on my injection pump but I want to make sure before I sink the tall green
into the car.

I know the car is running rich some of the time.  The spark plugs and the
exhaust pipe are black with soot.  If I accelerate and then back-off without
declutching, I get a flash out of my tailpipe.  After changing the plugs, my
car runs great but then degrades after a couple of months to something not
that much fun to drive (maybe the plugs are fouling?).

I'm getting some things that are running counter-intuitive to the idea that
my car is just running too rich.  When the injection pump was set a notch 
or two leaner a couple of the plugs had both black and white on them 
(indicating, I believe, both too lean and to rich).  My mechanic put
the car on the dyno (exactly what *DOES* a dyno do/measure, anyway?) and 
found that the mixture was fine from idle to 5000 RPM -- go figure.

My mechanic checked the back-off circuit (I'm not sure what the tech term
for it is) and said it was okay.  He did say he reseated it, though.

So my question is, DO I NEED A REBUILT PUMP?  If so, what do they cost (I've
heard numbers from $800 to $1500)?  Anybody have a candidate to rebuild the
pump or should I just go with the guy my mechanic typically uses (I don't 
know the guy's name)?  Is there anything for which I should watch-out during
this process?

Thanks!
