Steve:

You mentioned that you had this problem when adjusting the striker (the 
part mounted to the hood with the metal spring around it).  I had a 
similar problem when adjusting the striker on my '71 911, it was quite a 
scare!  As it turned out the problem was that the striker rod was 
slightly bent and as I turned it to adjust the up/down position of the 
hood it woould effectively move fore/aft and cross/car as well.  This 
caused the cup at the bottom of the striker to move into a position 
where it could hook under the fixed part of the latch.  I was able to 
free the hood by pushing rearwards and side-to-side on the hood.  I 
straightened the striker and have not had the problem again.

Hopefully this will be of some help.

Good luck,
