Hi,

>> I have a 73 911T and am currently running 205/60 15 Yoko AVS Intermediates

on a 15X7 Fuchs on the rear.  I have some Yoko 008's that I am going to put 
on for track use and am concerned about clearance in the rear fenders.  The 
rear 008's are 215/60 15.  The fender lips are rolled.  I am looking for a 
some track rims for these tires and wondering if it would be better to go 
to a 15X6 inch rim?  Would this offer more clearance than going to a 15X7 
inch rim?  Also I have heard that the 911R wheels had a different offset to 
allow for wider tires with the early "narrow" body style - is this true?  
If so does anyone know what the 911R wheel offset was?  Any other info 
would be appreciated! <<

Here's some info that I updated from my archives :

On my '72 S, most of the combinations of 7x15 and 7x16 that were
recommended by several people won't fit on the rear. i.e.

 - 7x16 in the rear with a 205/55 
 - 7x15 all around with 205/60s 
 - 7x15 all around with 205/50s front - 225/50s rear 

I can not even fit 195/60/15 on the rear with stock 7" rims.
But my car is as low as it will go and still handle well. And the 911
cars are not all the same, so try to borrow the size you are interested
in and drive it HARD to see what happens.

I had only slight rubbing problems with 225/50/15 on stock 7x15 on the
front. This was cured by rolling the fender lips.
But on the rear I had to use the early "911R offset" Revolution wheels.
They are fairly cheap but MUCH heavier than a Fuchs forged alloy.

The stock 7" rims have all the extra 1" width on the outside of the rim.
The 911R has more extra width on the inside. I think the offset
on the different rims are :

Wheel      Backspacing  Offset
Stock 6"   4 7/8"       1 7/8"
Stock 7"   4 7/8"       1 3/8"  (Extra 1" is on the outside)
911R  7"   5 1/8"       1 5/8"  (1/4" more of extra 1" on the outside)
REV.  7"   5 3/8"       1 7/8"  (stock 6" offset, .5" added both sides)

Still, the 225/50 tires on the revolution wheels rubbed on the inside 
spring plate nuts (they did on the 6" rims too), so I had to use 1/4" 
spacers under the wheels, which makes the offset like the real 911R wheels.
This combination looks funny because the front is wider than the rear,
and may not be great for high speed track driving (may oversteer).

The 7x15 with 225/50/15's sure make an early 911 look muscular!
Too bad I had to go back to 6x15 and 205/50/15 for SCCA stock class... 
I guess I can still run the big ones in PCA!
