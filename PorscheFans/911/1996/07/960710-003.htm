Hi, 911 fans,
Haven't heard from anyone in a few days and thought I'd get this off 
before the list folded from lack of interest ;-).

I'm getting a fresh realighnment with corner balancing for my RS 
America soon and wondered how much benefit could be derived from 
switching to lowering springs such as H&R or Eibach. Most of the shops 
I've talked with favor H&R. But my mechanic says he doesn't like them 
because, unlike Eibach, they rattle loose at full droop. Not that I 
plan to jump it or anything, but can anyone share their experience 
here? I would think these cars need all the suspension travel they can 
get.

Any opions about which brand of lowering spring to use? I go to the 
club track events sometimes, but this is a road car.

I would be gratefull for any input here.

Thanks,
Jeff Canaday
