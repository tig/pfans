1) Remove the engine under tray fast. Bruce Anderson has posted 
notices on many occasions saying that failure to do this will result 
in serious premature valve guide wear on the lower side of the 
engine. The undertray on is there to reduce noise. 

The Swiss have very tight restrictions on noise levels and Porsche
had to go to extreme lengths to meet the requirements. At one time
it was thought that the air cooled boxer would be discontinued
because it was so difficult to meet the noise regs in certain
important markets.  The 993 uses a very slick trick to reduce noise.
Because of the crank throwsand some cunning engineering, the twin 
pipes actually cancel each others sound waves.  That's one of the 
reasons that 993's are so quiet even though the exhaust isn't very 
restrictive. Too quiet for my taste actually.

2) No they haven't fixed this on new models. Bruce told me to remove 
it on my 993 as well. 

3) I think everyone on the list will tell you, fresh oil is cheap 
insurance. I change mine at 6,000 miles (synthetic) including both 
oil filters. While doing track events, I change it after 3000 
miles. 

4) I change Brake fluid every year, twice a year if the car is used 
on the track. 

5) I change my transmission oil every year too.
