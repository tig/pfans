Hey,

Does this modification apply to all 911s or just the newer models?
I've never heard of it.  Along the lines of this subject, though, which
of the aftermarket seats (Recaro, Sparco, etc) permits the most
headroom?  I am considering putting a seat in my '76 911, but do
not want to sacrifice headroom (I'm 6'3").  I'd have to say that all of
the 911s I have ridden in that had aftermarket seats sacrificed
at least some of the headroom.  Is this just a given?  I would rather
not remove the existing factory mounting rails unless it is
absolutely necessary.

Any comments?  TIA.
