For the person looking to buy period 1972/1973 retractable seat belts.
 
After 23-24 years, the belts become soft and the return springs on the
retraction hubs get tired.  I would suggest trying to source out the rear
quarter panels from a '72 or '73, but purchase new belts and retraction
hubs.  You can get the belts and hubs from a supplier that advertises in
"PANO".  I forget the name (Performance Engineered Products, maybe?), but he
has a small ad at the back of the magazine, that advertises rear seat belts
for the cars that did not have them.  I purchased some rear belts for my
'72, so I could mount a child seat.  When I talked to him, he explained that
he had updated front belts and retractors that where designed for the later
911's, and would work better, and longer than replacing the stock parts.
 
Standard disclaimer, no affiliation with the company, just a satisfied
customer.
