As far as cash, I usually bring the core amount in one big cashier =
check, one smaller cashier's check, and cash for the rest.  Allows for =
some on-site bargaining power.

Subject: 	buying 911 out-of-state

I'm putting together a trip to San Diego during which I hope
to buy a 911sc and drive it back to Colorado. I have a few questions:
	what do I need to do as far as emissions, and plates on the
	car, so I can drive it home?

	what are some reputable shops in San Diego where I can get a
	car checked out?

	Any advice on transferring funds? I don't want to carry $12k in cash

This trip will be in mid-September. Wish me luck!
