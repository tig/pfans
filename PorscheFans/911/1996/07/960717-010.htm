Greetings: 

I just finished up installing adjustable 22mm Weltmeister sway-bars F/R on my 
'74 911 and thought I'd share a few tips I learned along the way to make this 
less painful for anyone else DIY in the future. 

1. The rears are a snap, just swapping in and out.  If you have an earlier 
'74-'77 911, make sure you get the smaller plastic bushings.  I didn't and 
spent another $25 at Automotion for 2 bushings and waited a week.  A 6mm Allen
socket eases screwing in of the long bolt mounted to the spring plate.  I made
my own from a cut-off piece of 6mm Allen key and 6 mm socket from a previous 
project.  

2. The front swaybar on '74+ cars is a bit more involved since you're 
replacing the old A-arm mounted bar with an earlier-style through-the-body bar
and the old brackets must be removed and the new bar mounted behind the gas 
tank.   2 triangular reinforcing plates are bolted to the inner fender behind 
the strut and the sway bar goes through the center of the plates.  I quickly 
came to the conclusion that I could not get my hands behind the gas tank so I 
removed the tank!  This is a lot easier than it sounds in a 911.  (Siphon gas 
out, loosen 2 fuel hoses under tank, unplug fuel level sender on top of tank, 
loosen vent hose and filler hose, remove 3 Allen brackets and lift out.  It 
can be done in 15 minutes.)  There is an embossed raised template on the inner
fender well where the factory conveniently marked the area for the plates and 
the sway bar opening. The rear of the triangular plate should be oriented 10 
degrees from vertical so it helps a lot if you scribe a vertical line on the 
fender before getting the front way up in the air.  3 holes are drilled for 
the plate but 1 hole is right behind the strut so either tilt the strut out or
do as I did and drill from inside since the tank was out.  Drill a large 1" 
hole for the bar itself.  I found a 1" drill bit at Sears for a 1/2" drill.  
Holes need to be perfect the first time else this area will look like swiss 
cheese. 

Next is cutting off the old brackets: this is a major PITA.  I used an air 
cut-off wheel and a reciprocating saw to follow the weld bead and a cold 
chisel when I got frustrated.  Be careful not to cut into the arm.  After 
grinding the weld down, a 7/16" hole needs to be drilled into the arm for the 
new U-tab bracket.  The swaybar is then installed with the drop-links to the 
the U-tab. Don't forget to lube the plastic bushing on the sway-bar.  The drop
links need to be adjusted to remove any pre-load after reassembly.  My 
starting position for the bars was half-way on the front and about 1" less 
than half-way (stiff) on the rear.  After my first run at Sunday's autox at 
Monclair, NJ, the car oversteered so I moved the rears out (loose) about 1". 

I'm still playing with settings so I'd be interested in hearing where other 
folks have theirs for a neutral track set-up since I'm headed back to Lime 
Rock next week. Note: I bought the bars used but Automotion was great 
providing tech support and faxing installation instructions. 

p.s. where is the best spot to place jackstands in front?  I used blocks of 
wood and placed them right under the outer floor but this doesn't seem too 
strong.  Is there a reinforced area which is safer?
