          Dave, some of your insurance questions will depend in the
          state you live in.  Here in Mass, auto insurance is strictly
          regulated, and many companies that offer special policies
          can't do business here.

          Anyway, I think that most regular street-use policies should
          cover you at a driver's ed event, as long as the event meets
          the strict definition: Not race practice, controlled
          passing, no timing, etc.  Some companies cover incidents
          without question, and others need to be persuaded.

          I have Leland-West, but they don't cover track use.
          Interestingly, the old underwriter (Great American)
          specifically excluded all track events, including drivers
          ed.  The current underwriter (American Modern Home) is not
          that specific, and although they _say_ no coverage on the
          track, the written policy seems to have a drivers ed
          loophole.  I'm sure you'd have to fight them, so it's just
          not worth it.

          Some options:  Evansville Insurance Group, Evansville
          Indiana, (812)424-5578.  Club racing & drivers ed policies.
          Rates depend on driver experience and the number of events.
          _Minimum_ yearly rate is $1,000.

          For Leland-West type coverage, another option is Hagerty
          Insurance in Traverse City, MI (call information for the
          phone #, I lost it).  They don't write in Mass, so I never
          got very far with them discussing coverage.

          As far as your problem with book value versus actual, you'll
          probably need a written appraisal.  However, this may limit
          the coverage options available to you in your state.  In
          Mass, this type of coverage is gets weird.  You really need
          to work with your agent (hope their good).

          Hope this helps.
