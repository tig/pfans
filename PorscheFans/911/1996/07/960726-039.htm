Bill,

Brake fluid can decompose in two ways. If your fluid is perfect and there is 
not a single drop of water in it, the high temps from heavy braking will 
decompose the components. Now, if there is any water, the water can catalyze 
chemical reactions and accelerate the breakdown process. Two track days 
(depending upon the track and how agressively you brake and how wet the fluid 
is) could do it. The decomposition reactions will continue to occur (albeit at 
a much slower rate) when the car is just resting in the garage. It is just 
about impossible to keep your brake fluid dry. The fluid just sucks the water 
out of the air. The decomposition reactions are inevitable which is why people 
who take their cars to the track consider brake fluid to be a consumable item.
