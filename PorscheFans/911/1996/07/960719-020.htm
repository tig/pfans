Howdy,

If you (or anyone else) are interested I have a set of BRAND NEW
never used stored-in-bags BFG R1 205/50/15 in the sticky
autocross 226 compound. They are from the very last batch made.
I bought two sets when I found out they were being discontinued
last year. They are about a second faster in wet weather, and
faster in the dry too unless it is 100 degrees out. I have another
set that still has plenty of tread and are still very SOFT and STICKY.
The 230 compound never gets sticky for me at autox speeds.
I'm not running my 911S much so I don't need the extra set.

I'm not looking to get rich on these tires but won't be giving
them away either. Need cash for street tires for the SE-R.

lemme dough,

Regards, Mike Piera '93 SE-R  AnalogMike@aol.com
