Got a question about the replacing parts of the hand throttle and the heater
lever in a 68 L, and as usual, I find the Haynes manual lacking....

The first question, why in the world should I remove the floor plate for the
gear shifter before the plate around the hand levers... and then never do
anything with access to that part of the center tunnel??

Second, just exactly how does one go about disconnecting the emergency brake
lever from the brake cables?  I have unsnapped with the latch/clamp around
the push rod but for the life of me, I can't figure out how to unhook the
brake cables with breaking something - and all this with the paltry three
inches of space I'm allowed to lift the plate while the brake cables are
firmly anchored. grrr >:^<

That is the problem in a nut shell... now for a pipe dream question, this
whole exercise began when the nylon lever on the hand throttle disintegrated
(after 30 years, who could blame it?)...  Any is there any reason why a new
part can't be taken to a machinists and recreated out of brass or aluminium?
(read "I can get this done for almost nothing...")

Thanks!
