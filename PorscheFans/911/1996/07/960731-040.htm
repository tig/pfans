    Hi, Greg.

    I'm aware of what your point was... But it doesn't support your
    conclusion:

    So we're comparing a tap of the throttle that revs the engine
    from, say, 2000 to 6000 nearly instantaneously to a long PRESS
    on the throttle that ponderously raises the engine speed from
    4000 to 6000, right?

    Come on, Greg... As you, with your extensive experience and
    admirable reputation, know very well, there's no way to define
    "blip" in such a way that that long press on the throttle would
    be called "not as much of a blip" as the quick tap.

          Yep.
