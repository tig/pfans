Hi Mitch, 

Bruce's book is wrong, I think that was a typographical error, but it could
have been a Bruceographical error. I think that the really, really early cars
did use a different size and it may have been 6 mm, but I won't use that as
an excuse. 

It is OK that they AC bracket blocked removal of the valve cover, but the oil
line should not have obstructed the removal. You should be able to fit the
line so that you can remove the valve cover as well. 

Congratulations on your successful repair. 

Bruce Anderson
