     PorscheFans,
     
     Greetings!  I don't know about the rest of you, but the days without 
     PorscheFans' email I get some work done.  But when the email returns, 
     it does so with gusto!
     
     I've got an annoying problem with my 993 that my dealer has not been 
     able to solve (this is no big surprise in my dealer's case).Any help 
     with it would be appreciated. At about 17K miles I noticed the clutch 
     pedal wouldn't always return completely as I engaged it. This usually 
     occurs during leisurely first gear starts on smooth roads.  I'll let 
     out the clutch  and find that it will hang at the final detante about 
     an inch short of full travel.  I think the clutch is fully engaged at 
     that point, but it feels "funny" when the pedal doesn't follow your 
     foot all the way up.  I can actually take the side of my shoe and 
     "pop" up the pedal that last little bit of travel.  From my point of 
     view it feels like a fatigued spring that runs out of energy. What's 
     the problem?
     
     It's a killer machine otherwise :-)
