Hi James,

I think that your tachometer reading problem may be one of perception because
the factory for the Carrera engine has the rev limiter set for 6250 rpm. If
you are seeing that as 6,600 rpm on your tachometer it is understandable that
you might see a rev limiter that is set for 6,900 rpm exceed 7,100 rpm that
is only 200 rpm above the rev limit. 

Porsche raised the rev limit from 6250 to 6840 rpms on their Clubsport model
so I would think that anything up to 7000 rpm would be quite safe for the
valve mechanism. 

Some of the chip manufactures have set their rev limits up above 7,000 rpm,
which I feel is too high for the stock rods with the stock rod bolts, but
there should be no problem with the valve mechanism at these engine speeds.
Engines that have been modified for track use with different rods and or rod
bolts routinely turn much higher rpms without any valve problems. 

My experience has been that most engine damage is done when the car is being
shifted and the safe engine speed is exceeded by quite a margin. Just running
over the rev limit a little going up through the gears does not usually
damage the engine. You will hear or feel the engine loose power and shift.
The damage is usually done when either the wrong gear is selected or more
commonly when the car is shifted into the next lower gear at a speed that
will drag the engine up over the speed where the valves can keep up. This has
particularly been true of the newer engines with the 964 camshaft. Usually
when this happened with the older cars such as the Carrera 3.2 and the SC the
rocker arms would break. However, with the 964 engine there is enough valve
to piston clearance so that the valves do not hit the pistons, but instead
the valves are launched off into space and the valve travel is limited by
coil bind of the springs.
