Ask a guy who lives in Montreal about snow tires! I drive my C4 year 
'round. I drive on Blizzacks mounted to CT2 Borbet wheels 
compliements of Tire Rack. I'm happy to share my experience with the 
list and Jeff in particular.

1) Snow tires should be narrower than summer ones. Look in your 
owners manual, the factory gives their recommendation. On my car 
summers are 225 in front 285 in back. Winters are 205 and 225 
respectively.  Andy is right though, nowadays the winter tires are 
not as skinny as they used to be. Tread designs and compounds have 
changed a lot since 911's ran on 185's in the winter.

2) Blizzacks have the best traction on snow and ice bar none in my 
experience. Road and Track agreed when they tested them too. If you 
spend a lot of time driving on snow or ice I would rate them number 
one, no question.  I share Kevin's opinion. I got three seasons out 
of them on my previous C4.

3) Blizzaks are not perfect.  They are good on snow and ice because 
they are designed with little to no compromises. If you do *not* 
spend most of your time drving on snow and ice, you'll be 
disappointed with wear and hate the squirmy feeling which results 
from the spongy tread layer of microcells that makes then so good on 
ice.

4) Unless you live in the great white north and spend time in rural 
areas where the ice isn't melted by salt (for environmental reasons 
up here) I'd go with a more conventional high performance snow tire.  
I use Blizzacks because my country home is by a lake and the twisty 
road is snow and or ice covered from December through late March.  If 
I didn't go up there skiing every weekend, I'd go with the Michelin 
or Pirelli's which are very popular in this area. Toyo is also 
getting a good reputation with a tire they claim is designed for 
911's.

Regards,

Bob
