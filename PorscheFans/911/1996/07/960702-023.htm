Thanks all for your help in the project; I feel much better tackling things when I
have some idea of what to expect in advance. =8^)

Now I'm going to take advantage of you guys by asking more questions.....
While replacing the m/c, I also replaced the cloth covered lines from the reservoir
to the plasitc lines, as well as the reservoir clamp, which looks rather grungy. 
I'd also like to flush out the hard lines and new flexible lines before connecting
them to the calipers.

Is it safe to pump denatured alcohol through the lines and m/c?  Is there a better
way to flush things out?

I plan on following the flush with Castrol LMA (which I have sitting around), and
then ATE blue (in a new can), so I can see the color difference when bleeding.

Thanks again,
Mike
