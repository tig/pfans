It may well be that smog testers are bribable and slimy wherever you are,
Caludia, but in California they are 100% compliant due to the fact that
they risk a six figure fine and mandatory jail time if they were to fake
results. Additionally, the smog equipment connects directly to a State
computer system. Of course, it wasn't always that way, but I know no one in
the past two years who has been able to convince a testing station that
fudging a $30 test was worth the risks involved. Believe me, I have friends
who've tried. Even the guy who passed my (previously NOs-boosted) 928 a few
years ago wouldn't let it slip through these days.

Re-test? No, I wouldn't waste the time. Besides, a decent mechanic would
quickly determine whether a car was leaned-out to slip through a test,
which is something a smog station wouldn't know.
