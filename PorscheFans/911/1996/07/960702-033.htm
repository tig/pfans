I wouldn't necessarily assume that most were tight.  Sometimes it is
just plain difficult to get the blade in there (are you using the special
tool? - it is realy nice).  I have been told that it is better to be a little on
the loose side when adjusting valves, so I think they tighten somewhat.

I, many times, loosen the valve, slide the feeler blade into position and
re-set it (even if it may not have needed it to begin with) just because it
is easier than spending 5 minutes trying to slide .004 in blade into a
..0041 inch space :>).

Good luck,
