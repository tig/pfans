    Bob:

    As I said in that message, it's unlikely that the guy will
    actually HAVE the problems I described... I certainly wasn't
    trying to scare anyone.

    Springs that uncouple at full droop are WRONG.  Limiting the
    suspension travel to "correct" for those short springs is also
    wrong.  If you think too-short springs or limited suspension
    travel is in any way an ADVANTAGE, please let me know why... I'd
    really like to hear your reasoning.

    I have no experience with the new 911s (you drive a 993, right?),
    but none of the older 911 clutches want to be slipped at all.  If
    you're properly matching engine speed during your shifts, you
    should be able to treat the clutch as an on/off switch...
    "Feathering" it is neither necessary nor desirable.

    Actually, it's a geometric, not physiological, thing... For a
    given shortening of the distance between your hip and ankle,
    relatively more change in knee angle is required when your leg's
    extended than when it's bent.  Since you gauge the position of
    your ankle from the angle of your knee, this means that you can
    sense it more precisely when your leg's extended.

    Although you're right about this, my comment above still
    applies.

    So you're perfectly content to drive with your clutch
    maladjusted, but you don't want to tighten up your handbrake so
    it'll hold the car on a slight incline?

    True, but I thought we were talking about parking the car in
    your driveway.

    If you want to park your car in gear AT THE TRACK, that's fine
    with me.  In fact (I guess I should mention this so you don't
    think I'm being confrontational or anything), it's fine with me
    if you park your car in gear EVERYWHERE... I'm just trying to
    offer a little helpful advice; whether you choose to take it is
    your decision.

    Why not just tape a big red flag to the handbake lever when
    you're at the track?  That should be enough to overcome any
    habitual desire to apply it after a run.
