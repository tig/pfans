Terry Shugart asked about short shift kits:

Essentially there are 3 options:

The Porsche factory part, and at least 2 types of aftermarket.  I've tried
the aftermarket ones by Perf Products, and by Weltmeister/ Automotion.  Here
are my comments, from when I made the mod to my 911 about 3 years ago ...
(the mfrs may have changed their designs meantime ....)

The factory product, is reputed to be well engineered, but I did not
evaluate it in view of cost, and from the fact that it really does not
reduce the shift throws all that much.  However, neither will it increase
the effort required to shift, as much as the aftermarket ones.

The Perf Prod one is in one word (IMHO), pathetic.  You have to remove the
ball end of your shifter, and glue on another one.  Makes conversion to it
an over nighter since you have to wait for the epoxy to cure, and
essentially a  one-way change.  Plus, it has some extremely poorly designed
spacers etc ... a pretty rude effort (sorry...).

The Weltmeister one is a lot nicer in concept, since it is a complete re &
re of the old shifter.  However, it is not without it's own minor fault:
the large aluminum spacer plate that you get with the kit (to put under the
stock shifter housing) is nicely done, but has a "W" logo cast into it ...
this causes the shifter housing to hang up on it, and not sit flat.  I
machined it off on mine, and the rest of the update went fine.

I'd recommend the Weltmeister one (I have no connection with them, etc...)
as the best of the bunch in terms of design and results attained.  I'd
caution you to change *ALL* you shifter bushings when you're in there, as
well as the bushings in your flexible shifter coupling to the gearbox
(Tweeks has them).

Hope this helps,
....Gregg
