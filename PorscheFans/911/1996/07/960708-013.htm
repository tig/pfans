Came across this post I made last week to the NorCal Shelby Club newsgroup.  
We had just completed an "Open Track" event which means we have a track for a 
weekend and run about 65 cars in 3 groups for drivers ed or practice or car 
tuning or whatever reason you may have to want to drive at speed around a 
track.  There were a few Porsches there and quite a few other marques. Thought 
I'd repost it here to give Porsche Clubbers a sense of what happens at other 
clubs events.  Let me know if you don't wanna read this kind of stuff and I'll 
keep my posting more strictly Porsche related.  This was sort of a post event 
post. 
 
Also, it looks like our server is sputtering so this will also be a test.  
 
'Well, I assume everyone else had a good time this past weekend.  By Sunday at 
about 2 pm, judging by the numbers of cars on the track it looked like we had 
deposited most of the rubber on our tires onto the track, overheated cars and 
drivers, and worn out lots of parts.  Scott Griffiths was threatening to give 
away green groups track time to the red group if no one showed up on the pre 
grid in 5 minutes and that coaxed 3 cars out of hiding.  Just about everyone 
was thinking about fixin their cars instead of drivin 'em and Tim Kelly was 
still trying to wrestle the M-5 BMW steering wheel away from it's owner for 
yet another demonstration lap.  
  
Well, now it's time to tell the rest of the club what they missed.  I took a 
lot of pictures in the pits, focusing on non Shelby cars to give readers a 
sense of the politically correct automotive diversity we have at our open 
track events and will use them in the August issue.  We need a couple of Open 
Track stories for the August newsletter which will be rich in MiniNats content 
so Jan, Scotts 1 and 2, Walt, and the rest of you folks put your thoughts 
together while all the synapses are synapsing and make a few notes for a brief 
article or two. BTW I thought the Friday barbecue and tech was a wonderful 
touch and a great way to kick off the weekend.  The Doo Dah was great as usual 
and SCCA guys wouldn't believe the track time, "What, it's our turn again? I 
was just out there!"  
  
I actually was attempting to chronicle the whole weekend on my newcamcorder 
but it wasn't until Saturday around 11 am that i realized that I wasn't  
actually filming, just looking thru the viewfinder and thinking I was filming. 
Finally found the 'start' button.  Got the thing attached to the roll bar but 
didn't have the unit tightened enough and it began to pan from side to side as 
I went from corner to corner. Finally it got so loose that it would snap from 
taking a shot of the back of my head to a shot out the passenger window.  
Looked like I spun 90 degrees, snapped back and was still miraculously on the 
track and on the line.  Special effects right out of Lucas studios.  Finally 
got the bugs ironed out so I can't lie anymore about who I passed or caught up  
with as the video only speaks the truth.  In one session, the video is a  
continuum of A and B production Corvettes and Laurys' AS Vette passing me 
everywhere.  I'm playing this back thinking, "Hey, where the hell are all the 
Fords?  This is the Shelby Club isn't it.  Jeez, I didn't know  you could 
legally buy tires that wide."    
  
The on track experience is certainly getting more challenging what with the 
stopwatch and video remote taped to the tranny hump.  "Oops, forgot, to get my 
time on that lap. Let's zoom in on that car in front, it'll look like I'm 
catching up to him......., brake, heel toe, downshift, turn in, zoom 
out......"    
  
So, keep them card and letters coming.  Deadline is the 20th of July and the 
July newsletter should be at your door in the next few days.....
