I can't quite figure out what the fuss is here. Maybe I missed some posts or something.

To change the swepco in my tranny (83 911SC), I undo the side filler, then drain the old
oil into a pan using the lower drain. If the tranny is hot, it drains much better. Let 
that stand for about a hour or so. Replace the bottom plug.  I then use about a 4 foot 
clear 5/8" clear tube on the end of a funnel to fill the trannie. I have an old IV rack 
from my buddie who works at a local hospital to hold the funnel. Basically, I use old 
reliable gravity to fill the trannie. Elevate the funnel to about roof height on the left 
hand side of the car, run the tube through the rear wheel well into the filler hole, and 
just pour the swepco in the funnel. You should have an idea on how much swepco to fill 
the tranny.When the swepco starts to run out of the hole, pull the end of the clear tube 
out of the filler hole, and screw the plug in. Wait 10 minutes, unscrew the plug and 
check the level. This gives time for the swepco to settle, and you can get a good 
reading.

I warm the swepco in a hot water basin before pouring...it shortens the fill time.

Works fine, and no pumps or gadgets are to be found.
