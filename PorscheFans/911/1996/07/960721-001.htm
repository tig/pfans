Seems there's a trend here. In the Chicago region the board recently
adopted a local rules change that minimally requires a 5-pt harness for
driver and passenger in the faster groups at Road America and other track
events. The novice groups can still get by for now with stock belts. But,
where harnesses are required they are needed for both driver and passenger.


Doesn't someone on the list have a .signature that reminds us that once is
happenstance, twice is circumstance, three times is enemy action :")

I can recommend a supplier of a 5/6 point harness set that doesn't require
any drilling for 964 and 963 (and maybe 911) models if you drop me a line.
(No commercial relationship other than satisfied customer).
