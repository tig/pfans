Bob:

This is not normal.  Have someone bleed the clutch system.  There might be
air in the system, or you might have a bad master or slave.  You might like
where the clutch releases now, but the syncros in the transmission are
probably dragging.  993 syncros are very good, but they will not be happy
about this for long.  Don't think you will like it when you have to rebuild
the transmission.  Porsche doesn't replace syncros very often under warranty.
 They think all syncro damage is caused by the owner.  Don't suggest you mess
around with this for very long.
