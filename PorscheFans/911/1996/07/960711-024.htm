 Class Action Suit against Porsche

Excerpts from the German daily 'Franfurter Allgemeine' 6-4-96 ( similar story
in the weekly 'Der Spiegel" , the following week):

"A Swiss 911 Carrera C4 owner has started a class action suit against Porsche
AG, Stuttgart, in which he claims  " endangerment  (of drivers and
passengers) through negligent design & construction by the manufacturer".  

His case: while cruising the Autobahn at a reasonable speed, a fire without
any apparent cause destroyed his Carrera 4.  After investigating similar
"mysterious" and unexplained fires of seven similar C2's and C4's  (type
"964") which were built between August '89 and November '93, he hired a
highly regarded automotive specialist / investigator.  After some detective
work it was determined that the fire was caused by the tight space between
the catalytic converter and the rear bumper: 

A clearance of only 85mm between the cat which can reach a temperature of
940xcelsius, and the rear bumper which is made of polyurethane and catches
fire at 495xcelsius (point of self-incineration) was reduced further on the
plaintiff's car to 55 mm by a slight parking garage "bump", which was not
visible from the outside.  
The suit alleges that Porsche should have known better.
Though the plaintiff lost in the first round, his case is now being heard at
the appellate court of Stuttgart, which immediately  ordered an expert
opinion by a court-appointed panel."
