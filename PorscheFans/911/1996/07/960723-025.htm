> Is the 914 fun to drive like the 911?

        The 914 drives a lot like the 911, with three exceptions.  1) When
you push on the 911's "go" pedal, things happen--NOW!  The 914's "go" pedal
is more of a suggestion.  2) When you push on a 911's "stop" pedal, things
stop happening--NOW!  The 914's, again, is a bit more of a suggestion.  3)
The rear fenders of the 911 like to move *just* that extra three inches to
hit the cones delineating the exit of an autocross turn.  The 914 just goes
where you point it.
        The feel is only a bit different.  As someone else said, the 914
drives more like it's on rails--it goes where you point it.  The 911, on
the other hand, likes to power-slide more.  I think it drifts better.  But
the other side of that is that you *do* have to drift it more.  If the 914
goes where you point it, the 911 must be danced with.  (Don't let it lead
or you'll be sorry  ;)
        For other "fun factors", the 911 probably has the edge.  Seating in
most 911/2 cars I've sat in was better than 914 seats.  For the most part,
more comfortable, and in pretty much all cases, more "grippy".  Except for
my car, which has the bottom seat cushion more or less permanently removed.
I have built-in padding so I don't miss the cushion.
        Gauges are similar.  The view from the 914 is rather good--except to
the rear.  Pedals are essentially identical, at least to the earlier 911's.
I can heel-and-toe my 914 all day long; the CRX isn't nearly as nice.  The
big minuses, however, are in the sounds department, and the shifting.
        Nothing else sounds like a 911 engine.  The 914 sounds kinda like a
Bug, at least at low RPMs.  When you get close to red-line, it starts to
develop a very nice note.  Right about where your power starts to drop off.  8(
        The shifting is...  Well, legendary.  The 901 tranny is shared with
the 911's up until 72, but can be kinda balky.  Having a shift linkage that
goes from the middle of the car aaaallll the waaaaaay to the back just serves
to aggravate things.  As does the tendency of people to not replace the shifter
bushings.  The result can resemble a butter churn, where your choice of gears
is dependant mostly on luck.  New bushings will improve things a *lot* from
this worst-case, but it still won't shift like a Miata.
        Overall, the 914 is like a street-legal go-kart.  Open air motoring
(when you want it), great road-holding, buzzy, just-you-and-the-pavement.
The 911 is like...  Hmmm....  Well, it's like a 911!   ;)
