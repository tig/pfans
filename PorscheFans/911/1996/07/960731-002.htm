Interesting that when I was at Holbert's in  march '88, looking at the
assemblage of Miller 962 cars, I saw an odd device on the table.

"What's that?"  I asked Bob Russo, who was giving the tour..

"A Titanuim Torsen Differential" he replied.

In that titanium diff the helical gears were exposed and he let me pick
it up and look at it.

"What's it for?"  I queried...

"We use them in the 962s" he replied.  "It works like a limited slip,
but's much more efficient and can only transmit torque in one
direction, by the way...don't drop it, it's REAL expensive".

"Cool!"  I said, having no idea what the hell it was, but putting it
down carefully as soon as possible.  It was a couple of years until I understood
what it was for.

I guess I'm a stupid fool, but I have a quaife in my car now.  Seems to
work.  My inside tire doesn't do smoking burnouts anymore.

Dunno about the factory, but Porsche Motorsports USA used torsens at
least for a while.  They seemed to know what they were doing.

My assumption is that a Quaife is a torsen.  If I'm wrong than so be
it.

FYI,
