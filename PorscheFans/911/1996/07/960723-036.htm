Hi Mike,

These would be the lines to the engine I guess?

Yeah, I have the short lines that connect the cooler to the hard lines,   
but I still need to get the short lines/thermo from the hard lines to the   
engine.

The thermostat is external on a '73 isn't it? On my '72 it's on the
filter assembly I think.

Yes, and your setup is probably better, from what I've heard.

I will probably put the cooler in the front RS spoiler, that would
be the best place. Then I guess I could use any lines, but a thermostat
would still be a good idea. Maybe going all aftermarket
would be the way to go (lines, thermostat, cooler) so as to
avoid the "Porsche prices syndrome". Any other feedback
appreciated.

I've heard the factory thermostat is the best you can get, but you know   
how that goes.  If you are going with a front cooler, I'd strongly   
suggest the Terbotrol (or is it Turbotrol?)  They have the best cooler   
design anywhere.

Keep me posted.

Cheers,

Bob
