Scott:

So glad that you have such faith in the Quaife.  However, I think that we
should get a few things straight. 

Porsche was given a Quaife to test by Ron Mosier at Autotech (he was the
original importer to this country) some 8 years ago.  The did test it, and
returned it's lifeless, worn out, burned out remains to him.  They said that
it was not up to their standards, thanks.

You say "just because the factory uses it does not make it superior."  This
is one serious nearsighted statement.  Porsche is certainly aware of the
products on the market.  They do not live in caves.  They use a clutch style
limited in the GT-2 Turbo, the Evolution Car, the New 993 Cup RSRs,  all of
the European Cup Cars, the 94 RSRs, and all of the street vehicles.  Now,
Porsche is in the business to win races.  This sells cars.  This makes them
money.  This makes them happy.  And you think that if there was something
better out there, they wouldn't be using it?  Hello!  Anyone home?

The new generation of differentials that change the locking effect were
created as a direct result of the early European Cup Races.  They were not
(repeat not) used to "get around the understeer issue I mentioned earlier."
 When you drive a 911 into the corners real deep (Which ABS and trail braking
techniques allow you to do), the rear end on a 911 tries to step out.
(Oversteer)  The increased locking effect of the "trailing throttle lockers",
which is what the factory called these units in the beginning,  increases the
locking effect and drives both rear tires at the same rate.  This keeps the
rear end going in a straight line and helps with the oversteer under braking
problem.  Of course, the more the locking effect, the more horsepower needed
when accelerating through a corner. (Anyone tried to push a race car with a
locked rear end with the wheels turned?)  So, as you get back on the
throttle, the locking effect decreases, which is what is desired.  

So now, lets review.  Race Car.  Corner.  Don't want to do all my braking in
a straight line, because the 20 guys behind me are going to go past.  Need to
brake when the car is turning. (Trail braking)  ABS lets me do this.
 Differential helps me do this.  O.K. exit to corner.  Inside tire does not
spin.  The 20 guys behind me are still there.

Well, but what does the Quaife do for you in this situation?  Well, gosh,
gee, you get to watch the 20 guys who were behind you drive away from you.
