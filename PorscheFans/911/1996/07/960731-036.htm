Bruce:

I've never had many problems with these cars dying returning to idle, just
the problem with the dying when you release the clutch.  You might be right
about the cut on the teeth.  Read some Bosch stuff once on how the sensor
reads the teeth.  Turns out that the sensor actually starts its reading on
the slope of the tooth.  If you look closely at the slope of the teeth, they
are really funny. Could be that because I always have used the factory stuff
(except when we are putting these engines into a 915 box), I haven't seen the
problems with wierd tooth shape.  In the 915 box we use a special factory
flywheel and have a machine shop I use exactly duplicate the location and the
shape of the teeth, just smaller.  

The only problems with stalling when returning to idle that we have had is
with either RSR cams or with Woods cams.  We got around this problem by
having a box built that hooks up directly to the idle stabilizer and
eliminates the stock wires.  This box is a self contained unit that lets one
adjust the idle speed with the turn of a screw.  Works great.  If you want
1000 RPMs of idle speed, you just turn a little screw and you get it.
