I'm pretty firm in my belief that I wouldn't use the camber plates for a 
street driven car.  The rubber bushing at the top of the shock mount absorbs 
vibration that otherwise could stress and crack the tower sheet metal.  I 
don't use them on my track car because they push me up into another class for 
PCA Club racing.  You might check whatever rules you're running under to see 
how using these units effects your class. 
 
Go faster hint:  The later 944's, 87 and up I believe, had a much heavier 
rubber bushing in the top mount than the earlier cars.  Get this unit if you 
want to stiffen the upper mount.  You can find them used and in great shape 
for very cheap.

I've had a set of similar monoball strut tops in my car for three or four
years.  I have a set of the K-M parts sitting in the garage, waiting for
free time to install...

The camber adjustability is *very* attractive, particularly because the 944
factory adjustment is a) a pain to work with, b) can come out of adjustment
with sufficient laps at a rough circuit (Bridgehampton), and c) the factory
bolts have only a few cycles before they need replacing, at best.  Being
able to make the adjustment at the track is a wonderful thing.  Being able to
de-camber the car for a long ride to and from the track (in the rain...) is
quite a plus as well.

Whether the added ride harshness is a big negative is up to you, purely a
personal thing.  I don't mind it, nor does my wife.
