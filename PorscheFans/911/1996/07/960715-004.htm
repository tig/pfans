Hi Mike,

What brand of oil are youse guys using. Most cam failures are a lubrication
problem. With a 1972 I am not surprised that we are seeing some pitting, oils
weren't so hot back in 1972. But oils are great now I am a little surprised
to see this problem on a new car. 

1) Replacement is a judgement call. If they aren't too bad I would watch
them. We had an SC one time with pitting. We would watch it every service and
as I recall it was something like 40,000 miles before we finally broke down
and installed new cams. I would recommend that you replace the rockers on the
pitted lobes as well. 

2) There is not much you can use in the C4. There are two reasons that you
can't do much. One is valve clearance and the other is that the injection is
pretty intolerant of overlap. The overlap makes the engine run rough and fail
emission tests. 

That said, Jerry Woods who did the GE cams has a cam, but it is pretty lumpy
at idle and will not pass smog. You have to want the performance increase bad
enough to put up with the problems. 

The C4 is a good cam. It is a good modification for the earlier Turbos and
CIS and DME injected cars. Stick with stock for stock car performance.
