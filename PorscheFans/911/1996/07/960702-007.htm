          SUBJECT:   Broken 911 Engine
 
 
I posted a message a few weeks ago about the broken engine in my 911, and
thought I would send out an update.
 
I removed the engine from the car, and after removing the intake system and
left side heat exchanger (need to get the wrench to remove the right side
SSI exchanger), I looked in the exhaust port of #3 cylinder and saw no valve
in the valve guide, but the valve head and pieces of the valve are on top of
the cylinder.  Not really a surprise.  There was at least 1/8" (or maybe
1/4") of carbon build-up on the wall of the exaust port and heat exchanger
gasket.  I guess this valve had been on its way out for a while.  When I
removed the MFI fuel injector out of the heads, #1 and #6 injectors are
covered with oil build-up, looks like the intake valves to these cylinders
are leaking.  In general the engine burned a lot of oil (as much as a quart
every 200 miles in the city), so looks like a fine time for a rebuild.
