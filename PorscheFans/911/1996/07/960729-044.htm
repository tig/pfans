Chip:

The lightened flywheel kit will not help hardly at all in acceleration, but
will help in de-acceleration.  When you lift your foot off of the throttle,
the reduced flywheel mass will allow the engine to de-accelerate much
quicker.  You will notice this entering corners.

Why not use the factory parts for this?  They are proven.  Haven't had much
experience with Patrick's flywheels, but have had many of the others
(unnamed) come floose because the material is too soft and the bolts dig in.

The car will certainly (as already mentioned) be a little trickier to release
the clutch.  I just means that you need to drive the car.  The stock flywheel
is so heavy, a first time ever kid learning to drive would have a tough time
stalling the car.

The clutch disc must be changed to help with the chatter and the shock
loading to the input shaft of the transmission.  The original disc has no
springs in it.  The shock loading is absorbed by the dual mass flywheel.

Additionally, if the pressure plate is an original F&S with the light weight
lifting springs, you should change this to the updated Luk pressure plate
which has much stronger lifting springs.  The stock plates break at an
alarming rate in track use.

Don't expect much from the exhaust change.  Actually, don't expect anything.
 We have not been able to measure a horsepower change on the dyno with this
change.

Springs.  Could write a book on this.  Be careful.
