I watched Martin at Willow Springs this year.  It looked like he had to sort 
of coast thru turn 1.  When he would put the pedal down going thru the turn 
the car appeared to pull the front wheels off the ground.  The quaife was 
definitely workin' overtime and the tires were getting the power to the 
ground.  It was pretty impressive.

Greg,

One of nice things about the Quaife is that you do not notice it when
you are driving. Unlike the factory LSD which is constantly reminding
you that it is there. You don't notice the Quaife until you see the lap
times that is. Clearly there is a difference between an open diff and a
Quaife.

Also, Martin Snow uses Quaifes in all of his cars (Melanie's too). These
cars aren't exactly down on horsepower. He does not 'light off a Quaife
faster than a M-80 with a 1/4" fuse'.
