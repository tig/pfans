All of us with 964s know that we should remove the engine undertray. Bruce
A. has been saying it for years.  So I finally got down under my car
yesterday and did it. Thought I'd share the experience.

There are 14 bolts holding the tray and one plastic nut in the rear center
area. I think they're all 10mm. I removed most of them with the car on the
ground and me on my back underneath. I only had to jack up one side to be
able to wriggle under and remove the last two or three that are at the
leading edge of tray.

Caution: The tray is actually rather heavy and I suggest you leave the bolt
in the center of the tray for last so that the tray is supported as you
remove the bolts from the periphery. Then hold the tray with one hand as
you loosen the last bolt.

Imagine my surprise when I got the tray off and discovered, gasp!, a small
oil leak at the timing chain gasket. The oil loss measured in the
tablespoonfulls, but the tray was catching it, and it would have stayed
hidden if I hadn't been following Bruce's advice. I cleaned the tray up
nice and shiny with P21s cleaner and a hose. Dried it carefully and put it
against a wall in my garage with the bolts in a baggie.

The difference in exterior noise level without the tray is zilch to my
(admitedly rock&roll-damaged) hearing.  In the car there's just a touch
more of the lovely 911 burble sound.

Bottom line: Do it. It takes 15 minutes. It doesn't hurt. It might make
your car feel much better.

'91 C4 (Going Indian-style, i.e. sans undertray)
