Bob,

Thanks for the reply!

I agree. I thought I might be able to find them cheap on
a wreck.

Yes. That's where much of the stock cooling is done.

These would be the lines to the engine I guess?
The thermostat is external on a '73 isn't it? On my '72 it's on the
filter assembly I think.

I will probably put the cooler in the front RS spoiler, that would
be the best place. Then I guess I could use any lines, but a thermostat
would still be a good idea. Maybe going all aftermarket
would be the way to go (lines, thermostat, cooler) so as to
avoid the "Porsche prices syndrome". Any other feedback
appreciated.
