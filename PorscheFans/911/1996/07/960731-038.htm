Well, had we planned this event in mid-July rain tires (or just plain
'tires' as we call them in the Northwest) might have been an option. You see
our summer falls in mid-July, generally the 12th to the 17th. You can always
be certain it's summer because the skiing turns to crap for a couple of days.

But July is now past, in fact since the Portland race is late August we move
into the mud and snow season so I suggest you look into the Wrangler
Mud-Slinger. It is an R rated, all terrain, mud and snow tire preferred by
the U.S. Forest Service and PIR racers alike. 

Unless of course we see some serious snow. In that case you will be left at
the green flag just spinning away unless you're sporting studs. We used a
carbon-kevlar stud last year which was incredible off the line but you gotta
watch them in tight corners. If the tire breaks loose accelerating out of a
corner (see LSD thread) those little suckers pop out of the tire and fly
through the wheel well and into the cockpit. Sounds like a popcorn popper
but deadly.

Tire chains are a solid alternative but the extra weight will add seconds to
your lap times.

Okay...just in case you are serious. August is our driest month. Odds are it
will be in the low 80's and dry. But if it's not, the tread found on a
shaved BF Goodrich is more than enough to make you competitive on a wet
track. Meanwhile the guys on slicks in the GT classes would really be fun to
watch!

Do we have your registration?
