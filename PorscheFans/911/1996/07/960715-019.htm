To all list-type people,

Just wanted to say thanks to all of you who helped me out during my search for my 944. 
 Now you will no longer have to listen to me ask you questions about purchasing one, 
but unfortunately will probably have to put up with lots of inane "how do I fix this" 
questions....

Reason #582 to have internet access:
Wednesday, about to give up on finding a "944 Turbo S", I made my daily rounds of the 
on-line car ads and I happened to notice that the LA Auto Trader is on-line in 
addition to being available at the newsstand.  And what did I find there? A 1989 944 
Turbo, 85K Miles, $12,900, Classic Motors -- Hermosa Beach, CA.  Hmmmm.  So I called 
on Thursday and I was pretty much the first caller.  Friday, I drove down (5 hrs from 
Monterey), left a deposit to hold it for a day so I could get it checked out. On 
Saturday, the dealer got over 15 calls on it (the most he could remember for a car) 
but had to say "Uh...Some guy already has 1st priority".  HA HA! Turns out that the 
web version of Auto Trader gets updated before the newsstand one gets published! HA HA 
HA! Finally, after a lifetime of hearing, "Oh, sorry, if you had just called an hour 
earlier...." I actually was the 1st to call on an ad! And all thanks to the infobahn!

BTW, the 944 is REALLY FAST, pretty comfy, and handles REALLY WELL (what with that 
Turbo S Club Sport package and all. NOt as good as the 914, though....)  Perhaps I'll 
get a 911 next, and a 356, perhaps a 928 too, and and and....
