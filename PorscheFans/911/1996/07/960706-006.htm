Howdy,

I'm not an "expert" on engine work but have been adjusting my
911S valves for 11 years with no problems.

Using the automotion type tool, you can usually get it in there
after getting the oil out of the gap by moving the cap a bit.
Then if it feels good, no need to loosen the nut and adjust.

 anything. >>

Very interesting, I'll try it next time!

<<  It's also really amazing how when you use
 a feeler gauge on the valves you almost always wind
 up with a loarge setting than 0.004".  I've experimented with
 a feeler gauge and then checking with a depth gauge that could read
 to 0.0001", and the feeler gauge method always resulted in
 an actual lash of 0.005 or more. >>

If you go for the "STIFF sliding fit" of the feeler and can just
barely slide it, it should be .004". You can really feel the
difference in slideability when you adjust it a bit.

 gap, while important to set right, isn't critical
 to ten thousandths of an inch. >>

I hope so, because when one of my valves feels close enough,
I note it ("a bit tight/loose" in my log book) and go to the
next one. Then next time I may adjust it if it's worse.
