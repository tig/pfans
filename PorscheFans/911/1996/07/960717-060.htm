Hi, gang,

   I do not know a lot about this car, but an acquaintance has a 1966
911 to get rid of.  It was her ex-husband's ex-project ;-)  It has been 
in storage for 20 years.  Many restoration parts are included.

  I have not seen the car, but a mutual acquaintance who is a knowlegable
restorer of older Detroit iron has looked it over.  He says there is moderate
rust: rocker panels, front cowling near windshield, and front fenders (I think).
He did not know to check the front pan or battery box (hell! or even where
it was!! :-)

  Engine is reported to be in runnable condition, albeit with a holed piston.
Interior is decent.

  If you are interested, I can get more info.  I don't know what she is asking
(SHE doesn't know!), but she is beginning to accept that it is not going to
be as much as she thought a second-model-year 911 would fetch.  Car is located
on Long Island, New York (about 15 miles from the awful TWA crash site....)

later,
Paul Lyman   plyman@bnl.gov
'82 911SC Targa  (also for sale!! buy me!!!)
