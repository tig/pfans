Bruce:

I think that the dying problem is that the electronic control for idle is
designed around the stock flywheel.  It just can't respond fast enough to
correct the idle speed for the lighter flywheel, nor if the clutch is let out
too fast without throttle does it has enough volume to correct.  Chips that
bump the idle speed up seem to correct for this.  If there was a screw for
the idle, that the electronics didn't try to defeat, I don't think that
anyone would have a problem. 

Actually, just sent off some thoughts about springs to Jeff Canaday in Japan.
 Didn't save a copy.  Jeff, if you have it, and you are listening, maybe you
should post it.  That way, maybe some more people can get their panties in a
wad. (Quaifes)
