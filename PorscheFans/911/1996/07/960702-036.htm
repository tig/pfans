A late 80's Carrera is fantastic, they maintain that 'classic' Carrera 911
look and if you go for an '87 or better you'll have the advantage of a 950
tranny which is virtually bullet proof and with a hydraulically assisted
clutch.  I find my 87 has a great sports car feel and is a little tiring to
drive in stop and go traffic, I just love to get out on the open country
roads for a good run and then you are rewarded with what the Porsche name
really stands for.  The luxury bit comes from the fancy items like power
windows, a/c, power seats, cruise etc. etc.  These are fantastic items to
have and a real benefit for driving long distances...which is what you are
going to use the car for right?

As far as the C-2 cars are concerned, I would either go late 80's or get a
993 (the ultimate 911 if you are in the position to do so)...I like the
early 90's 911s don't get me wrong but you have to get rid of those heat
shields to prevent exhaust valve damage...just as Bruce A...I'm not sure
whether he got any satisfaction from PCNA for this obvious problem?
