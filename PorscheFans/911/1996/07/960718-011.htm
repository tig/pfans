Hey guys, back to Porsche talk (see, no more money stuff!), where should I
get my car aligned?  Some Porsche mechanics have told me that cheap places
like NTW or Just Tires have just as good of equipment as a specialist shop
that would charge 3X as much for a 4 wheel alignment.

I just put new tighter springs on my car and have changed the height slightly,
so I do need a good alignment so my tires don't wear on the inside, like the
used to do...

I do have a Euro 928 to boot, which is supposedly even more of a pain to align.
Will these places adjust the height to make my tires wear perfectly, or will
they only align it at the height that it set to when I bring it in?

Thanks for any info,

Sean '80 928

While what Mike says is true about it being the sellers responsibility in CA
(as it is in MA), it is still worth your while to have the test re-done when
you buy a car from a private party.  They could have gotten a positive result
from a friend who does smog tests, or by slipping the tester a $gift$.  If you
assume the sellers smog test is legitimate, but it really wasn't, YOU will have
to pay for repairs, etc. the next time you have to get the car smogged.  If it
fails when you have it retested immediately after buying it, you have can go
back to the seller with a justified complaint, and a good case if you have to
pursue it further.  I think an immediate retest is an excellent idea.
