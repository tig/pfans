Guys,

The Brainerd Race, June 29/30 was a great success.  Garfield Clark was the
Event Master and Roger Johnson (Racer Extrordinare) served as Registrar.
 Both did outstanding jobs and the only mystery about the event is that more
Club Racers do not attend.  There were just over 60 registered racers,
including 7 first time rookies.  The track, just over 3 miles in length, is
great and the people of the Nord Stern Region even greater.  

With only one rather minor incident, the racing was great.  19 cars were in
Class F and the racing between Roger Johnson, Chris Holm, Justin Draper and
Eric Pilhofer went on all weekend long.  Johnson won the practice starts race
while posting the slowest lap times - that's an indication of some real
talent.  Another star was Erik Johnson, who in a G Class 1978 911 SC built
specifically for Club Racing, finished 6th overall in the race and managed to
out drive most of the F cars.

In the first race on Sunday the following drivers won their respective
classes:

F - Chris Holms 1:55.408
G - Erik Johnson  1:56.522
GT5S - Doug Arndt  2:01.529
H - David Weisel  2:05.241
I - Jim Bryant  2:03.656
J - John Rebane  2:15.790

In the second race group, a fight of the titans was shaping up between Martin
Snow and Randy Alexander. Snow had dominated the field at the beginning of
the weekend but Randy continued to get closer and closer with only about a
second and a half separating them during the first session on Sunday morning.
 The race was not to be, however, as Snow's car refused to race and Martin
will head for Stapleton next to try and get the bugs removed.  Hank
Godfredson, of 356 fame, showed up with his brand-new, driver prepared GT3S
1976 911.  A beautiful car and Hank did a great job as piloting all of the
new power.  The car also managed to win in the Concours.

Class winners in the second race were:

GT1R - Randy Alexander  1:40.248
GT1S - Melanie Snow  1:45.888
GT2R - Peter Kitchak  1:46.076
GT3R - Jeff Conkel  1:50.103
GT3S - Hank Godfredson  1:51.584
E - Lance Flynn  1:52.730
GT2S - Tom McGlynn  1:49.025
D - Fred Senn  1:53.198
C - Larry Ezell  1:54.761
GT4R - Leon Steinberg  1:54.396
GT4S - Alan Friedman (DNR)

Of note is that Bob Johnson drove the SC in Exhibition Class during the
second race that his son had won with in the first.  Bob managed a 1:49.314
(just under an average speed of 100 mph) in the stock G Class car.  There was
a great deal of driving talent at this years Brainerd Race.

This is a race track that should to be driven.  See you next year at
Brainerd!
