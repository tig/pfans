Hey,

I had the same problem on my '76.  I took it out altogether.  I didn't really
notice any increase in the sound level and I haven't seen any signs of
any heat-related problems in the back seat area ( and I took it out a
couple fo years ago).

I actually think the engine compartment looks alot better with it removed.

Yank it out the best you can and then use a shop vac to suck up the various
"crumbs" that will fall all over the engine compartment.

Good luck,
