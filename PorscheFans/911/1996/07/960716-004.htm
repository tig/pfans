Hi Paul,

I for one prefer the model specific postings.  It is less time (and 
space) consuming to get the information that I really want.  I believe 
that this was a problem for a lot  of people on the old list and caused 
them to unsubscribe.  I think we need the greatest number of contributors 
we can get.  Maybe some of them will come back to the fold now.

As for the people posting to all three groups when the post is model 
specific, that's almost spamming in my book.  I really didn't care about 
the 924 water pump or thermostat or whatever.  I would have subscribed to 
that group.  924/944/928/356's are all fine cars, afterall, they're 
PORSCHES, but I prefer the spend my time and disk-space on my preferred 911.

My 2 Pfennig,

-Bill Tomko

BTW,  the only reason that this is posted to all three lists is the 
automated reply function on my mailer.
