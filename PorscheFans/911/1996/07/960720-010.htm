 I am also looking into putting in a cage and possibly getting a racing seat.

Mike: 

I think the consensus is equal restraints/seating for driver/instructor.  At 
least, that's the way it works in NNJR events.  The final decision is the 
instructor's.  We had our chief instructor refuse to ride with an 
out-of-region driver who had 5-pt/racing seat for the driver and stock for 
passenger.  Although I didn't like spending the extra $$ myself, if I were an 
instructor, I'd feel the same way before stepping into a student's car.
