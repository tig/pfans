    Congratulations! I expect to pick up a 88 944 TS this weekend. From a
    fellow Bay Area (soon) 944 TS owner..

    -Byron

To all list-type people,

Just wanted to say thanks to all of you who helped me out during my search for
my 944. 
 Now you will no longer have to listen to me ask you questions about purchasing
one, 
but unfortunately will probably have to put up with lots of inane "how do I fix
this" 
questions....

Reason #582 to have internet access:
Wednesday, about to give up on finding a "944 Turbo S", I made my daily rounds
of the 
on-line car ads and I happened to notice that the LA Auto Trader is on-line in 
addition to being available at the newsstand.  And what did I find there? A 1989
944 
Turbo, 85K Miles, $12,900, Classic Motors -- Hermosa Beach, CA.  Hmmmm.  So I
called 
on Thursday and I was pretty much the first caller.  Friday, I drove down (5 hrs
from 
Monterey), left a deposit to hold it for a day so I could get it checked out. On

Saturday, the dealer got over 15 calls on it (the most he could remember for a
car) 
but had to say "Uh...Some guy already has 1st priority".  HA HA! Turns out that
the 
web version of Auto Trader gets updated before the newsstand one gets published!
HA HA 
HA! Finally, after a lifetime of hearing, "Oh, sorry, if you had just called an
hour 
earlier...." I actually was the 1st to call on an ad! And all thanks to the
infobahn!

BTW, the 944 is REALLY FAST, pretty comfy, and handles REALLY WELL (what with
that 
Turbo S Club Sport package and all. NOt as good as the 914, though....)  Perhaps
I'll 
get a 911 next, and a 356, perhaps a 928 too, and and and....

Tim "Summmm-bodah STOP maeeeee!" Radsick
