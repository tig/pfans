James comments on the Autothority chips are not the same as I have experienced.

The first chip I purchased didn't seem right and wasn't doing the job, dyno
data.  However the chip did limit the revs to + 500 over stock on my 93 RS.
When I enquired about the power situation Autothority sent another chip
for my application and limited the revs to stock redline per my request.  A
check at the track showed that the chip did hold the rpm's to the stock
redline.  The car also felt better, no dyno yet.

>In my case. an Autothority chip was put in by Autosports Designs during a
>$21,000 rebuilt job on my 911 track car ( a 1989 Carrera engine). I noticed
>that the engine occasionally went to 7,200 or 7,300 rpm without any sign of
>a rev limiter coming on. Autosports said " Oh, no, your revs wouldn't' go

>So, I put back the factory chip, and it does indeed cut off the gas at about
