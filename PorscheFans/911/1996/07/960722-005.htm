 The reasoning for requiring at least equal restraints is that the driver
 will not drive beyond the capabilities and feeling of comfort/confidence of
 the restraint that he is using.
  
 This was told to me second or third hand, so the facts may not be totally
 correct.

As far as I can tell, this requirement varies widely from region to region.
 Rocky Mountain Region Drivers Education Rules state, "All cars must be
equipped with a lap belt and a shoulder belt for the driver.  If the car has
a front passenger seat installed, it must also have a lap and shoulder belt.
 Belts must be equal to or better than the factory original as supplied in
that model car and be in proper working order.  Where installation is other
than factory original, the belt mounting must be anchored securely with large
diameter washers or plates on both sides of the mounting holes.  Swivels must
have the eye bolts welded closed.  Five point competition belts are
recommended on all cars."

Sounds like we tend to be a little more liberal here in the mountains.  I
guess with the thinner air and all, they feel airborne cars don't return to
terra firma quite as hard as they do at lower altitudes.  ;-)  (I *know* they
don't go as fast.)
