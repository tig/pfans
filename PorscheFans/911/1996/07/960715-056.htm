    Wow.  36,000 miles on one set of tires?  Amazing.  NONE of my
    cars will go that far; my newest car, in fact, eats its
    expensive rear tires every 7-10,000 miles.

    Unless there's something drastically wrong with your front toe
    (which I'd doubt, given that the tires have lasted so long), the
    tires are wearing only because they have lots of negative camber
    (that is, they lean inward).  Negative camber (up to a point)
    helps cornering performance by arranging things so that when
    you're cornering hard and the outside tire leans outward, it
    ends up essentially vertical.

    If you only (or mostly) plan to drive your new car on the
    street, you'll find that the inside edges of the tires will wear
    more rapidly than they should.  You can correct this by aligning
    the car with less (that is, less negative) camber.

    Pro:  They look really bitchin'.

    Con:  They may not fit in your wheel wells.

          They're more expensive.

          If you try to squeeze too wide a tire onto your existing
          wheels, you may end up with a SMALLER tire footprint,
          since the sidewalls may have to be pulled in so far that
          the tread shoulders lift off the ground.

          Unless your wider rear tires also have a lower
          aspect-ratio than the stock tires (that is, unless the
          second number in the tire-size designation is lower than
          50), your speedometer will read low.

    I really like Yokohama AVS Intermediates.  They work pretty well
    in the wet, they last a (relatively) long time, and they perform
    well.  They're also available in a HUGE range of sizes and
    they're not all that expensive.

    My sister, who lives in Colorado, mounted Blizzaks on her Subaru
    and can go ANYWHERE in the snow.  She loves them.  I live in
    Southern California, so I have no direct experience with the
    new-generation snow tires.
