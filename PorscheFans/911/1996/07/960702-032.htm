Mike-
It certainly would work to get all of the old fluid out, but can you
imagine what any alchohol left in some corner of the system will do the
the boiling point of the brake fluid that you put in the system.  It would
seem that a complete dissassembly of the system would bew needed to make
sure that no alchohol was left.  Also, denatured alchohol is by definition
ethanol with some chemical added to make it undrinkable.  I would think
that one would want to know what the denaturant was, and whether it was
"rubber friendly".
