Has anybody ever experienced buying a custom chip which had no rev limiter? 

In my case. an Autothority chip was put in by Autosports Designs during a
$21,000 rebuilt job on my 911 track car ( a 1989 Carrera engine). I noticed
that the engine occasionally went to 7,200 or 7,300 rpm without any sign of
a rev limiter coming on. Autosports said " Oh, no, your revs wouldn't' go
that high- your rev gauge
must be wrong". Two months later, my engine was damaged at Watkins Glen
going past red line in acceleration. The valves were bent and I had it towed
back to Autosports Designs to have the engine repaired, costing $4,000.

After getting back the rebuilt engine, I had the rev gauge tested and the
rev gauge was very accurate. Therefore, I put the standard factory chip that
came with the car back in, and the rev limiter worked fine. So, believing
that maybe I just had a
defective chip, I have tried 2 other Autothority chips, the last sent directly
from Autothority. (Autothority told me their newer chips are set to a "soft
cutoff", starting at 6,500 rpm and fully off at 6,900). I then tested the car to
see if the Autothority chip had a rev limiter. In the test, ( with observers) I
took the car in third gear up to 7,100 rpm three times without any sign of
the gas being cut off!  This is the third chip which had no rev limiter that
I could find. 
So, I put back the factory chip, and it does indeed cut off the gas at about
6,600. I will keep the factory chip - I don't want to pay for another valve
job. Most track people think a custom chip in a non-turbo car is not hard on
their engine, but my experience proves otherwise. 

What is your experience with custom chips? Do you find not having a rev
limiter  scary on a track car? (Rev limiters have been a Porsche standard
since the 1960's)
