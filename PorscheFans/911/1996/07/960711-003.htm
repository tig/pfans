I went ahead and put the 911 front end on my 914 over the 4th weekend; had
sent out some mail about it, but then the list got flakey, and I'm not sure
it went out.

Anyway, went ahead to tackle the rear suspension, now that I have all the
misc pieces to assemble the Vellios rear.

Well, there are 6 bolts that hold up the outboard ends of the rear control
arms; they are removebale to add/remove shim plates for alignment.  Well, I
removed 5 of them with a rachet and breaker bar.  Push, push, push, *CRACK*,
and the bolt spins loose.  Well, I went to do the last one (closest to the
engine on the driver side).  Push, push, push, *CRACK*, and I fly forwards. 
The bolt had snapped off.  So now I have a threaded portion of the bolt stuck
in a recess about 1-1.5" deep.  Kinda important bolt too....

Anyone have any ideas on how to remove this puppy?  I called the local shop,
and they just frowned; suggested I take it to a body shop, and have it cut
out... (Huh??????)

Car looks kinda funny with 215/50's on 7's in front, a 165/70 on one rear,
and an empty void in the remaining corner.....

Sigh,
Mike
