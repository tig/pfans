Bruce,

Thanks for the spec on the 911 alignment, I didn't have too much faith in the
spec's in the Hanyes book.  I'll have your recomendation in my hand when my
friend and I align it soon.  We're waiting for the Olympics to pass and for
his rack at work to be calibrated so we will be sure of the settings.

BTW, I had mailed you a while back on the case for my rebuilt 2.7.  I talked
to the previous owner who had the rebuild done, and he said it had an
aluminum case.  I still need to call Frans Blam in Atlanta, who did the
rebuild and see if he can tell me scoop, or look at the case.  It was painted
black and I haven't had time to dig under the car and scrape some off yet.

Thanks again, hope to find your book soon
