I'll jump in. I've got a '91 C4 daily driver and am on a different path
than "racing", that's real PCA club sport racing. I'm staying in the
driver's ed events and I just drive fast on the track but I don't plan to
get into wheel to wheel.

1) I think the C4 is an excellent platform for exploring how to drive fast
because it is so forgiving of typical beginner behaviours, e.g. too hot
into a corner, or lifting in a turn. Although you learn best with seat time
and experience, it is very hard to get a C4 out of shape on the track. So
you're denied the pleasure the C2 guys have of seeing where you've been (or
looking at the oncoming traffic head-on at the entrace to a turn :"). I
mean you might ignore the lessons available when the car saves your rear or
just learn sloppy technique because they can be subtle.  Get a few good
books on technique so you can think about and appreciate the dynamics of
racing. Suggestions: Henry Watts: Techniques of Solo Racing or Winning, A
Race Driver's Handbook by George Anderson. There are, of course, many many
others.

2) For general handling improvements the next thing is to have it aligned
and balanced.  Bruce Anderson suggests the Euro RS specifications (or as
close as a knowledgeable shop can get on the stock suspension). Also be
sure to have the car corner balanced. A good shop with track experience is
vital here since your preferences on handling .vs. tire wear etc can be
taken into account.

3) The car prefers to understeer rather than turn sharp as a result of the
design. It's built into the suspension, made worse by AWD and relatively
narrow front tires as well as encouraged by the computer programs that
control the locks.  Wider front wheels are a part of the cure. Suggestion:
at least 7" and 9" wheels (16 or 17 inch).  Everyone except Porsche says
that  8x17 fronts can also be applied to the car. I am going to 8x17 front
and 9.5x17 rear wheels.  But 16" should work OK too and will result is
slightly lower tire costs.

4) Lowering the car and stiffer springs. This will lower your center of
gravity and reduce body lean.  Unfortunately you can't lower the car too
much using the stock suspension since it doesn't provide enough threading
on the strut bodies with the US height springs. That's where the lowering
spring kits from Eibach and H&R come in. You can also replace the shocks
and springs as a kit and H&R and Ruf and others have such products in both
street and track configurations. If your car has more than 40k miles have
someone you trust evaluate the condition of the original equipment shocks
if you're just going to do the springs.  I'm having a Ruf suspension kit
put on my car. All of these kits are incremental improvements over the very
tangible gains you'll have with better tires and lowered suspension.

5) The brakes need to be augmented or you will warp rotors and experience
fade over a track day. The Cool Brake kits duct air into the rotors to cool
them. Price is a few hun'a'bucks. [Note that these should probably be
removed during winter if you drive in an area with salt or sand on the
road.] Also be sure to have your system flushed and filled with a high
temperature DOT 4 fluid like ATE Blue. You can use some kind of racing
pads, but that will become a matter of preference. Personally I prefer the
Pagid brand (either stock or the racing compounds). [My car is being
upgraded to larger calipers and rotors, and if you're serious then you have
lots of options in this direction but they all tend to be in the thousands
of dollars range].

6) Jerry's right about safety. At least a 5-pt harness is mandatory so you
can concentrate on driving and, as the recent "equal protection" thread
suggests, you might need one for an instructor so you have someone riding
with you safely helping comment on your technique.  If you are over (say)
5'7" you should consider a harness bar rather than the seat-based support
for the belts. You're trying to reduce the chances of spinal compression in
an accident and it all depends on where your shoulders come out relative to
the harness straps. I used the Brey Krause bar.  I  can't see putting in a
full cage or even a roll bar for a daily driver. Just moderate your driving
style to the knowledge that you don't want to ram into walls or flip the
car ;')

6) More power? Why bother? You can go plenty fast on the straights, and the
fun is in better management of speed in the turns. I too have the K&N
voodoo filter. No negative effects noted, but filter cleaning becomes a
maintenance activity rather than a throwaway item.  I am replacing the rear
muffler with a B&B bypass pipe - retaining the cat and the secondary
muffler.  I'm doing this for weight loss. Will let you know how that sounds
and performs.

I think the C4 is the best year round daily driver and can be a great fun
track car.  Sure it weighs 200 lbs more than a C2, but I appreciate all  52
servos for what they do to help keep me safe. All my mods are intended to
keep it a comfortable daily driver and allow it the car to handle a bit
better than I need it to on the track as I improve my skills.
