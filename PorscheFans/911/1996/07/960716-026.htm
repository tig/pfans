Hi SnowPhiles:

Boy, all this talk about snow tires in July is really chilling me out. I 
can just barely make out Jingle Bells and White Christmas in my 
background "head music" (now that I've stopped humming Mission 
Imposible).

I think the key to the Blizzak vs GW contest is location and usage. I 
just ordered the GWs for use with stock C2 16-in. wheels for my RSA 
(softer ride). From what I was able to learn on the phone, the GW is 
popular in Europe as a winter Autobahn tire, real good on ice and slushy 
muck you find when snow doesn't stay for 8 months of the year, and are 
designed for handling and durability for high speed runs on dry 
pavement.

If you live in Finland or Wisconsin ;-), the extra bite of the Blizzack 
or Hakkapolitta will be appreciated at the expense of dry handling, 
noise and tread wear.  So far, as good as snow tires have become, you 
still can't have it all.

Obviously no one but a Finnish ralley driver needs 130 mph speed ratings 
for driving on snow. But, for my area where it only snows a couple of 
times a season, I needed a tire I could put on and leave on all winter 
and not endanger myself if I "forgot" and ran it at Porsche speeds on 
dry pavement on the way to the ski slopes.  If I had to plow my own 
roads just to get to work, I'd go with a lower speed rated, 
Minnesota-Edition snow tire.

Ask me again in February and I'll let you know how well theory compares 
with practice.

By the way, to all you guys with real snow experience, what is the 
collective wisdom on tire widths. It seems to me that a narrower tire, 
say 205, vs. 225, would have more weight per square inch and sink down 
deeper and bite better. True, or bad intuition?

Let it snow, let it snow let it snow...
