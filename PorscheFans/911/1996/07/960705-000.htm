I've spent many hours in the garage since last Saturday's event.  This 
is not fun when the temperature is in the 90's and the humidity is 100%! 

My friend cut about an inch off a Craftsman 8mm allen wrench, and a 
standard 5mm worked fine (Bruce Anderson's book states that you need 5  
and 6 mm wrenches - maybe older cars?).  I reinstalled the rocker 
arm that fell out, and all the other rocker arm hardware on the right 
side of the engine.  This probably isn't done very often with the engine 
in the car and I have lots of cuts and bruises to show for it, but how 
often do rocker arms fall out!

I took this opportunity to install the turbo valve covers that have been 
sitting around, and a set of new gaskets.  Also I replaced the NGK 
platinum plugs with standard Bosch copper plugs.  

Since the sump cover gaskets were included in the set, I decided to 
replace them too.  After hearing about how important it is to make sure 
that the oil pickup goes through the hole in the sump screen, it's nice 
to see first hand what this meant.

Removing the right side valve covers also required the removal of the 
rear A/C bracket, and the oil line that goes from the left side of the 
engine, around the back, to the right side.  Both items blocked the 
valve covers from being removed.

After the right side was finished, I removed both left side valve 
covers.  All rocker arm hardware was very tight on the left side.

It's obvious at this point that the mechanic simply forgot to torque the 
right side hardware.  When I mentioned what happened to him, he said 
that he tightened everything.  There really wasn't any point belaboring 
the point.  He wasn't going to admit to anything, and it really wasn't 
important to discuss the matter further.  

If you saw his shop, you could understand how something like this can 
happen.  He has many cars lined up that he works on, and he goes from 
one car to the next changing parts, adjusting something, reassembling, 
etc.  I know that some serious engine builders have separate rooms for 
engine work, and won't even take phone calls when they're building an 
engine.

So the car is back together.  The engine leak that it had since the cam 
replacement is gone, and again it's bone dry, even with the switch to 
Mobil 1!  The cold starting problem that it had is much better, mabye 
because of the new plugs, and the right side chain tensioner rattle due 
to lost oil pressure is gone.  

One lesson I learned is that it's much better to drain the oil before 
the valve covers are removed, rather than after (ask my garage foor 
why)!

Thanks for the help, especially Kevin.
