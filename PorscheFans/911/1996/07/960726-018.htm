Greg,

One of nice things about the Quaife is that you do not notice it when
you are driving. Unlike the factory LSD which is constantly reminding
you that it is there. You don't notice the Quaife until you see the lap
times that is. Clearly there is a difference between an open diff and a
Quaife.

Also, Martin Snow uses Quaifes in all of his cars (Melanie's too). These
cars aren't exactly down on horsepower. He does not 'light off a Quaife
faster than a M-80 with a 1/4" fuse'.
