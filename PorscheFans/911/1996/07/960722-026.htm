I've had a set of similar monoball strut tops in my car for three or four
years.  I have a set of the K-M parts sitting in the garage, waiting for
free time to install...

The camber adjustability is *very* attractive, particularly because the 944
factory adjustment is a) a pain to work with, b) can come out of adjustment
with sufficient laps at a rough circuit (Bridgehampton), and c) the factory
bolts have only a few cycles before they need replacing, at best.  Being
able to make the adjustment at the track is a wonderful thing.  Being able to
de-camber the car for a long ride to and from the track (in the rain...) is
quite a plus as well.

Whether the added ride harshness is a big negative is up to you, purely a
personal thing.  I don't mind it, nor does my wife.
