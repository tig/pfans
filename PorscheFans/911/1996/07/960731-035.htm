Heh, this is kind of fun.

My point was that if you had a heavy flywheel, the engine, during a shift
would not lose as many RPMs as quickly as if it had a light flywheel.  You
would therefore not need as much of an increase in RPMs to accomplish the
shift with a heavy flywheel as with a light one.  Therefore, it would not
require as much of a blip.  I think we all understand that an engine with a
light flywheel will move from 4000 to 6000 in nuetral vesus the same engine
with a heavy flywheel.  Guess it depends on what you consider a blip to be.
