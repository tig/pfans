I am in the market to purchase either a:
~ 1979 911 Turbo
~ 1986 911 Turbo
~ 1989 944 Turbo S

I am steering away from the 944 Turbo S as I hear more and more stories
about them.  My goal for the 911 is to turn it into a real street rocket.
I currently have a 1992 Talon AWD which is hopped up.  I participate in
auto-x, track events, and now, drag racing (best 1/4 mile is 12.7 @ 107!)
with my Talon and intend on keeping this great little car for that sole
purpose, to race.

If I purchase the 911, I would like to update the body to the C2 turbo look
from the various manufacturers around.  Anyone have any suggestions as to
one good company that they have had good experiences with?

I would also like to purchase an RSR type rear wing.  Once again, any
suggestions on the right company to purchase from?

Now, onto the engine goals.  My goal is to have 400hp at the rear wheels
which I don't think is asking much.  What would be required to reach
this goal;  I am very familiar with turbo technology and engine terms,
so be as technical as possible, although any simple answers will of course
be appreciated also.

The 911 may be used for a track day here and there, and definitely taken
drag racing, but I don't intend on beating the crap out of it all the time.
I will however, be running the crap out of the engine on the street,
not high speed, but high revs and lots of fun.

So this is what all the questions boil down to, and a few more too:
~ What are the major, if any, differences between a 1979 and 1986
  911 Turbo?
~ How much work is involved in switching over the old torsion bar setup
  for some threaded coil overs?
~ What would it take to reach 400hp at the *rear* wheels?
~ What company would you recommend for the C2 turbo body updated and
  an RSR wing (prefer carbon fibre center section).
~ Can rev limiters be fitted quite easily (MSD?)
~ Are there aftermarket computers available that would take care of
  boost, fuel, timing and rev limiting?  What are their costs?
~ What are your opinions on this particular model of car?  How would it
  react as a daily driver?  What should I expect running costs to be like?
~ Any major problems to watch out for or have replaced immediately?

The going price for a 1979 911 Turbo around here is about C$36,000! so
I want to make sure I'm buying the right car.  That particular one had
68,000km on it.

I know these are a lot of questions, but it's very hard to get a Porsche
guy's attention long enough to answer some hard questions, so I thought
I'd throw them all at you at once.

Any info on the 944 Turbo S would be appreciated too, but my primary goal
is to buy my dream car, which is, OF COURSE, a 911 Turbo.

Farzaan.
