Q: I see that W...Meister says in their strut brace
   ads that they measured .175" of compression between
   the shock towers under cornering conditions. If say,
   all this movement happens to just one side (at a time)
   and the distance between the top of the strut and the
   spindle is about 18" that would translate into about
   1/2 degree of camber change. [.55 = arctan(.175/18.0)]
   I'm just curious, how bad is a 1/2 degree camber
   change ?

Q: A friend of mine was told that to replace the rear torsion
   bars in his 944 "they would have to lift the body off" (his
   words). This sounds even more absurd than say, having the
   engine in the front <g>.  Before I volunteer to do them for
   him, could anybody tell me if they're as easy to do as
   my 911's were ?

   thanx,
