I know that many engine controllers carry a history
of the engine performance in RAM.  This is because
engine operation is imperfect, as are sensors, A>D
converters et. al.  When you remove all power for
sufficient time to force a true, cold-boot, the controller
starts from a different history, and you may indeed
get a much better running engine.


I'm not saying that this for sure is what is going on,
but I 'm trying to say that swapping ECUs is expensive
and may not be the problem.
