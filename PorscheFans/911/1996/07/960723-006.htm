Phans,

I am in the process of trying to talking a friend/associate out of leaving
the way he has installed his pistons in his 78 SC while rebuilding it. He
has installed these CIS pistons with the dish or large recess towards the
intake valve. He has stated that the haynes manual under Engine rebuild says
to install them with the big recess towards the intake. I have shown him
that in the same manual, in chapter eleven, that it says all CIS pistons
should be installed with the large recess towards the exhaust. He counters
that CIS came out in 73 and that the haynes manual would cover the piston
for CIS and that the supplement section is for DME motors and beyond (I can
kind of see his logic, but....) To save a nice rebuild from pink, pink,
pink, thud on start up, please help settle this. 

Thanks for the help,
Steve
