I had a problem at my last drivers ed with the brake lights going out.  I
too went through the bulbs, wiring etc.  I finally gave up and took it to my
local repair shop.  The problem ended up being the switch on the
transmission for the reverse lights.  Hope this helps.

The build up on the tires are normal.  On the cool down lap and the drive
into the pits, the hot tires will pick up stuff from the track.  The next
session out, you need to take it easy the first lap and make sure you get
the tires scrubbed off before making a full speed run into the corners.  I
would not worry about it, just be aware it's there when you hit the track
again.  Somtimes I drive my track tires home, Interstate driving does not
wear the tires much, and I will hear chunks of rubber hitting the car as it
comes off.  You can't safely or legally get the tires hot enough on the
steet to completly clean them up.  At least where I live.
