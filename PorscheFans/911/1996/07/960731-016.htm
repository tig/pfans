Does anyone have any experience with rebuilt distributors? The distributor
in my '70 911E finally broke after 275,000 miles. The shaft in the
distributor had too much vertical play and the timing would not stay
adjusted. Anyway, I had it rebuilt by WW autowerkes in Oregon. It looks
great and everything appears to be in tight working order.

The problem: I can't get the car to idle correctly. It idles fine first
thing in the morning, when it is cold. However, after it warms up it wants
to idle at 2000 rpm. The only way to get it to idle at 1000 rpm is to put
it in gear and slowly let out the clutch with the brake on. Once the rpm's
are forcefully lowered to 1500 or so it will drop to 1000 on its own.

Am I doing any harm by forcefully lowering the rpms? Does this sound like
a distributor broblem or could it be something else...I have webers on it
now? I have had the timing and dwell checked twice so I know it is in the
right ballpark. It did not do this before the distributor went belly up so
that is what makes me think it is the distributor.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

TIA, Chris Nielsen
