Mark,

I'm surprised your shop is surprised about doing the rebuild yourself. When I
did a rebuild of my right rear caliper, it turned out much much more easier than
I had imagined.
My tips:
If you don't get a piston out, put some wood between the jaws and use compressed
air. Just hold the "air-pistol"  close to the nipple and blow away (the wood (+-
3 cm. thick) avoids the piston from becoming a deadly projectile).
Getting the pistons all the way back in can be a real pain. Don't use force but
make sure the rubber ring is in the right place (take the piston back out to
check if you're not sure) and use a twisting motion.
For the rest, the rebuild is pretty straight forward.

Good luck,

          Well, as usual, my ability to leave things to the last
          minute has caught up to me.  This weekend I was installing
          new brake pads (Cool Carbons) in my 911SC in preparation for
          a track event on August 2.  One piston in the left rear
          caliper would extend only under very heavy pressure, and I
          can't push it back into the caliper.  The old pad on that
          side was frozen in the caliper, and worn less than the other
          pad.  Looks like rebuild time.

          No one in the Boston area has any rebuild kits in stock, so
          I have to wait for the local dealer to get one tomorrow.  I
          thought rebuilds were pretty common, but even the
          independent shops seemed surprised I'd want to try my own
          rebuild rather than replace the caliper.  Am I making a
          mistake?  There's no fluid leakage, just the hung-up piston.

          Any gotcha's I should be aware of?  I know to make sure the
          piston surface is not pitted.

          I hope to get the caliper rebuilt and installed tomorrow
          night, leaving Wednesday or Thursday for tech inspection.
          Cutting it close!

          Pads.  To break in the Cool Carbons, I was planning to drive
          around town a bit to get them warm, then make a couple of
          hard stops from about 30 mph, followed by a couple of
          deserted highway (60 mph) stops.  Should that be enough?

          I get the digest, so in the interest of time, please respond
          to me directly as well as the list.

          Thanks!
