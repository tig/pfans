Hi Phans:

Greg Brown asked me to refloat the first chapter of what many of us
hope is his new book on the subject of springs. It was originally
written to answer my question about what to do to make my as yet
undriven RSA more fun to drive if I ever get it to Japan. Here it is
uncut and unedited (except the secret $15 K-mart part that cuts 2
seconds off his lap times :-). Hold on to your hats. This is good.

Jeff:

The RS America can be made to handle very progressively and very
predictably.
 It can also be a nightmare.  Many of the cars are the latter.  We got
to
where we are with these cars by a rather comprehensive study of these
cars.
 We need to start somewhere, so I think that the best place to start
is with
a study of progressive springs.

Progressive springs have numbers of spring rates associated with them.
Lets
assume for this conversation that the rear springs are 200-600 lbs.
The
front springs will have a different rate of say 150-500lbs.  This
means that
the first 2 inches of travel are at 200 lbs.  The spring then goes
into a
parabolic curve of spring rate that ends at a rate of 600 lbs.  Since
all of
the progressive springs have a beginning rate below the weight of your
car on
any corner, the car sits in this parabolic curve part of the spring
rate when
it sits still.  Now as you drive the car and go through a corner, the
rate
increases on this curve, which is not linear.  The result is a
constantly
changing spring rate.  This is great, if the spring is exactly matched
to the
weight of the car.  Since this is not usually true, the car with
change from
oversteer to understeer, back to an oversteer and them to understeer.
This
can happen in different ways.  For instance, the car may start with
understeer, get more understeer and then as the car loads up the
spring, may
go to sudden oversteer.  This was the case with the American Cup cars.
These
cars were almost impossible to drive.  They would do this very thing.
They
would continue to lean over and seem O.K. and them all of a sudden,
the rear
would come loose and the car would rotate.  The European Cup cars
actually
had the same problem and they by the rules could not change the
springs.
 Their solution was to lower the cars to the bump stops and then use
the bump
stops to tune the suspension. If you study any of the pictures of
these cars,
you can see that the tires set in the same place in the wheel well
when
sitting still as when they are going through a corner.

The European Cup cars could get away with this because all of the race
courses are as smooth as a plate of glass.  This is not the case here,
so we
needed suspension travel to make these cars work.  The solution was to
remove
the progressive springs and use a pure linear spring rate.  This made
the
cars very predictable as they leaned over.  None of this years IMSA
GT-2
Porsches use anything but linear rate springs.  We use linear rate on
almost
everything.

The next problem is that of making the cars too stiff.  The softer the
car,
the wider the margin of predictability.  The cars will go faster with
stiffer
springs, but drivers need a chance to get used to a car and the more
the cars
talks to you, the easier it is to drive.  I know of a least 2 RS
Americas
that were totaled because someone made too big of a change in spring
rate.
 The cars reached the limit and the drivers had no idea of what was
going to
happen and lost the cars.

As the driver learns the car, we watch the cars and when the driver
has
gotten to the point of lifting tires off of the ground and can control
the
car, we will raise the spring rates.

Obviously, I recommend a linear rate spring.  This requires shock to
match.
 The Cup Suspension that Monty and Mike used worked great.  The shock
valving
matched the spring rates we were using and these cars were super easy
to
drive.  Both of these guys became instant heros in the PCA events,
because
their cars were so easy to drive up to and over the limit.  They won
almost
every event they entered.  (As a matter of fact, Mike never lost
except to my
own car at Willow Springs, and since the cars were so evenly matched,
he had
to blow a tire for my car to win.)

More Later.
