1) Andy! Are you trying to scare the guy with horror stories of droopy 
springs? Sheesh. H & R and Eibach know what they are doing. Sadly 
some mechanics at P dealers do not. 

2) I like the clutch engagement down near the floor for a lot of 
reasons:

    a) It is faster, you can feather the clutch in with a minimum of 
    motion. There is less uncertainty as to where engagement begins, 
    it begins almost as soon as you lift your foot.
    
    b) I have better "fine motor control" with my leg close to 
    extended than when my knee is bent a lot. I think this is a quirk 
    of the human body.

3) I prefer to park in first gear because I have little to no faith 
in the handbrake.  I've noticed that to make it hold in my driveway 
(slight slope for drainage only) you pull it up to where it seems to 
be tight and notice the car rollling backwards.  I also prefer 
to ignore the handbrake because if I did, I could suffer brain 
fade after a blistering run on the track and set it.  That 
often results in seized brakes.  

Up here part of our teaching routine for Greenies at DEW is to remind 
them after a run:

    a) Don't keep your foot on the brakes while taking off your 
    helmet, harness etc.    
    
    b) Don't use the parking brake.
    
    c) let the engine idle for 5 mins if you have a turbo.

The above is part of my "teaching script".    

Thanks for the input on the sticking gearbox everyone. I'll try 
bleeding the hydraulics and pay a visit to the dealer next week if 
that doesn't cure it.
Bob
