Racers like the light flywheel because it makes downshifting using heel
and toe easier. You need less of a blip on the throttle to correctly
match engine / transmission speed. I would think you would notice a 
little faster acceleration, but not too much.

The lighy flywheel makes driving on the street tougher. Unless you
shift pretty quickly, upshifts not going to be nearly as smooth. With
the light flywheel, you take your foot of the throttle to shift, and
the revs drop instantly. Then you put it in the next gear, let the
clutch out, and the car jerks as the engine has to speed up.
