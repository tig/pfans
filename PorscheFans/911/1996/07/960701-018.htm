I just got a catalog from Racer's Wholesale.  They sell a line of fans
that look like they'd work well with oil-coolers.  The fans come in
sizes from 6" to 13" dia, blow or suck configuration.  They're about 3"
thick including the enclosure.  The 6" fan, which I figured would be the
right size for my Terbatrol, sells for about $35.  They also sell a
(adjustable?) thermostat kit for another $15 or $20, and mounting
brackets for $5 or so.

I haven't called them to inquire yet, but it sure sounds like a good 
deal.  I'm more than willing to do a little fitting and fabrication to 
save $150.

My to-do list is a bit long, so this might not make it in this summer, 
but I'll keep you posted if it does.
