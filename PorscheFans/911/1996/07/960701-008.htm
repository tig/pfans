Dave,

What type & brand did you use for you breakerless conversion.  I tried the 
Crane Cams version in my '73 911S & had nothing but problems.  First, it 
wouldn't fit in the distributor, had to file down the wheel that fits over the 
distributor shaft.  Next, the tach wouldn't work correctly, blew 2 of them 
before I gave up & this was with Crane's tech support sending me little gizmos 
that were supposed to help.  The advance mechinism in the distributor didn't 
provide the complete range of advance with the Crane installed.  If I set the 
timeing at 6000 RPM, it ran about 10 degress advance at idle, if I set the 
timing at idle, I only got about 30 degrees at 6000 RPM.  

I've re-installed the points, set them with a feeler gauge, set the timing & am 
completely happy until my next tune up.

Would like to know your experience with this type of conversion.

Thanks
Otto Krossit
