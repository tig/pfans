OK, thanks. I'll ask some local RS experts that I know (Jim Newton,
Prescott Kelley). We have a ton of RS's in CT. RSRs, 935s,
SC/RSs, etc  too.

Yes. Bruce Anderson has written that a correct engine is worth
20% of a cars value. When the RS's were $100,000 that would
be a nice chunk of change, now they are about $45,000 I think.

Nowadays with the good studs and timeserts people are appreciating
them because they are lighter than the alum. engines.

I paid $1000 for a 72 S case (just the case) a few years back.
An RS case should be worth at least twice or 3 times that.
Some people were asking (and getting) $2500 for 2.4 S cases.

Well it costs about $8,000 to rebuild one professionally, although
they do sell for less if someone else is willing to eat the loss
(as is often the case!).

Thanks for your reply,  I'm still trying to determine what to do.
I'd rather trade it for a real fresh, nicely built copy of an RS engine.
It would be COOL to rebuild it and have a real RS engine, but
if I throw a rod on the track then I lose my investment.
I'd rather be slightly uncool than poor ;-).
