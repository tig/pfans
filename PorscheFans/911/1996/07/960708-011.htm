Nice car for autox, big wheels, light and good torque.

Could have been better with 225/50/15 all around. Maybe try
it next time (or 205/50/15 in front if the 225's rub and you don't
want to roll your fender lips). 245/50/15 will fit on the rear
but may not be necessary on a 2350 pound car with under 200 HP.

IMHO these are about perfect for an SC, but you can run a few
pounds lower on an earlier car. My 2330 pound S is best with
28 ft 30 rear (my guage reads a bit high though, maybe try 
even a few PSI lower).
