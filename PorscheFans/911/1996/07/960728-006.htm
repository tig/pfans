Subject: Steering wheel advice wanted
Philip, your questions and my advice:

I'm thinking of changing the 4 spoke stock steering wheel on my blue '89MY
Carrera 3.2 to a 3 spoke sports wheel. Sadly the factory part
(000.043.161.00 7JX) costs 470 pounds Sterling in Blue (or 418 pounds in
Black), which is more than I want to spend (and anyway, neither Porsche
Cars Great Britain nor the factory have one in stock). So:

1. Has anybody any experience with aftermarket steering wheels? Any that I
should look at or avoid? Nardi? Momo? Raid?

- I installed a MOMO Evolution 4 steering wheel in my '84 Carrera several 
years ago, largely trying to get a little more thigh clearance (I won't
comment
on what I look like).  I was entirely satisifed with it; smaller diameter
gave
me the added clearance, plus thicker rim amde for surer steering, especially
during autocrossing and race track driver's education events.  Quality was
excellent, easily equal to the factory.

Downside was the loss of the horn push going all the way out to the rim, I 
was stuck with a kiddie-size horn button in the center of the wheel.  I think
this is universal with aftermarket wheels.

2. What are the good and bad points of going for a steering wheel of
greater or less diameter than the stock one?

- See above; smaller diameter equals better thigh clearance but heavier
steering.  This didn't bother me too much, since I feel the MOMO wheel
gave me a better rim to bring in the muscle power.
