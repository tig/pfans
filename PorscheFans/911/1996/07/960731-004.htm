Hi Gregg,

The lighter the flywheel, the LESS throttle it takes to match revs for a proper
downshift. The key here is not that the revs drop when you take your foot
off the throttle, but that the engine has to be accelerated to higher RPM
to match the new gear. 

You're exactly right, a flywheel is designed to store energy, the lighter
the flywheel, the less energy it stores. Therefore, less of a blip (less
energy) is required to spin the engine faster.

Having never driven a 964, I really can't comment. A lot has to do with
driving style. 

On 964's with light flywheels occasionaly stalling, here's an except from
my regions newsletter:

Tom's Tech Topics, by Tom Papadopoulos

Enlightening the Flywheel Mystery

"After replacement of flywheels, either because of dual mass to single plate
conversion on Carrera 2 & 4 cars or lightened flywheels on earlier 84-89
Carreras, the normal complaint we hear is, 'Why is my idle speed dropping so fast 
that on occasion my car will stall? It didn't do this before the flywheel was
changed.' 

With the new flywheel, the idle speed controller cannot find the proper idle
because the engine speed drops through the RPM range much more quickly than 
it used to. To rectify this, the idle speed controller, which normally
picks up idle speed at 2200 RPM on deceleration, has to be altered to
activate at approximately 3000 RPM, giving the idle speed controller more tin
stabilize the idle.

We have come up with a cure and at present can supply you with a computer
chip that will do this. This computer chip will do nothing but alter the idle
speed controller. it is not a performance enhancing chip, although that type
of chip is also available. If you have come across this problem, please
feel free to give me a call at (516) 248 0066 any time during the day."
