I had a similar problem with my wife's non-P car.  It drove me nuts 
trying to get rid of the vibration on braking.  I had assumed, as it 
appears you have, that the front brakes must be the cause.  After all 
the rears just go along for the ride don't they?  You also mentioned 
that you do not feel the vibration through the steering wheel.  Maybe it 
is the rear brakes that are warped, that is what turned out to be the 
problem on my wife's car (after replacing the front pads and rotors 
first).

Hope this helps,
