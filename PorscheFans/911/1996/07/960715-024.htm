    Jeff:

    Think about your "not that I plan to jump it" comment.  While
    I'm sure you have no intention of flying through the air, there
    ARE situations (even at less-than-outrageous speeds on the
    street) where your suspension will go to full droop as you drive
    over a dip in the road.  With your springs rattling in their
    perches at full droop, you'll use a lot more suspension travel
    than necessary when the car "lands".  This is a bad thing,
    especially if you end up using more than you have and the
    suspension bottoms out.

    More important, though, is how your car will handle in corners. 
    In addition to keeping your car OFF the ground, as in the
    situation above, the springs also PUSH the wheels INTO the
    ground, right?

    When the inside springs become uncoupled in a corner, their
    wheels are no longer being pressed into the road.  At the rear,
    this can cause unwanted wheelspin; at the front, it'll tend to
    make your car push out of corners.

    As usual, it all comes down to how serious you are about all
    this. On the street, are you REALLY going to be affected by the
    problems I mentioned above?  Probably not.  Even on the track,
    it's unlikely that any but the fastest all-out race cars are ever
    going to roll, squat, and dive hard enough to push their inside
    wheels into full droop. 

    On the other hand, you said you're looking for performance
    enhancements.  If you really want to do them RIGHT, my advice is
    to buy springs that are the right length.
