I like the H and R springs myself, because they are available in a 
variety of spring rates and they have a set tailored exactly for the 
RS America (92-93) which will work properly with your stock shocks.  
You can call Performance Products at 800 789-1879. I found them to be 
very helpful. The Eibach Prokits are also good but as far as I know 
their model range is pretty restricted. I don't think they have a set 
designed for the RS. 

I've found that both the H and R or the Eibachs tend to rattle loose 
at "full droop" on the front until you adjust the spring perches. They 
are shorter than the factory springs. How else do you lower the car?  
Not a problem though. The factory (bless them) already thought of 
that.

The front of a 911 has adjustable spring perches, threaded collars 
below the spring which allow you to adjust the ride height in front. 
Once you move the collars upwards the springs are rock solid.  At the 
rear there is no such adjustment but the springs are locked into 
place by a different retainer.

As to suspension travel, you'll exactly the amount by which the car 
is lowered (1.25 inches).  The springs are progressively wound (on my 
993 at least) and the initial travel is a little stiffer than stock. 
As the suspension compresses it gets harder. You'll notice the 
difference on the track, less body roll and dive on braking. On the 
street, the car looks better at its natural (i.e Euro) height. Over 
small bumps the ride is similar to stock, over big ones you'll get 
jolted some.

The springs aren't too expensive ($360) and install takes about 2 
hours. You're doing the 4 wheel alignment anyway so go for it! If you 
hate 'em put back your stock springs, it isn't irreversible.  If you 
do a lot of track events, think about a track alignment too. The RS 
alignment specs are more agressive than ordinary 911's but you can go 
with more negative camber if you don't mind the faster wear of the 
inside edge of your tires. Sticks like hell on the track though.
