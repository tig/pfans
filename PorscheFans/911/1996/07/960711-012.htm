Phillip,
There is a retrofit kit for the clutch that is commonly installed to the 
early G-50 transmission. this replaces the original needle bearings with 
Bushings, new Fork and Shaft, also requires some minor rework to the clutch 
housing, reaming to accept the new bushings, I believe.
The Clutch should last a long time, in excess of 60k miles.  My clutch was 
replaces at 50 K miles when my rear seal was replaced, along with the clutch 
fork replacement and it showed over 50% life left at that time.
The new fork kit was developed to improve the feel of the clutch, as the 
Needle Bearings don't last long in oscillatory applications like the clutch 
throwout  fork.
