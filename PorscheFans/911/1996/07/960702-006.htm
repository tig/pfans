          SUBJECT:   RE: 911 valve adjustment
 
 
When you adjust the valves on a 911, you have to wiggle the jointed end of
the rocker arm to break the film of oil between the rocker and the top of
the valve.  It takes a little bit of work.  The first several valves that I
adjusted I thought the valves were too tight, and would loosen the valve
which would break the film.  Since you can not get the feeler gauge under
the rocker until the oil film is broken you would think the valve is tight.
I have found that on my 1972 the valve would keep their adjustment for a
good long time.
