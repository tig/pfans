Uh, no...

The microswitch, in combination with the RPM transducer, activates a
solenoid located on the MFI pump which totally shuts off fuel to the
pump under high RPM deceleration conditions.  Basically, if you lift
your foot totally off the throttle and your RPM is greater than approx
1500 RPM, the fuel is shut off.  This tends to eliminate backfiring on
some cars (not mine!).

When I explored this circuit on my car, I found a couple of fried
transistors on the RPM tranducer board (located in the electrical cubby
in the engine compartment).  The transducer has a built-in hysteresis of
about 200 RPM to prevent oscillation at during very light throttle.

A good test of the system is to rev the engine up and press the
microswitch.  The engine should immediately die.  If it doesn't,
something is hosed (most likely the transducer, but possibly the switch,
the solenoid, or the wiring).

On my car, I found that with the system in place, it tended to backfire
when you were decelerating and then decided to give the engine gas
again.  This tendency was much more than the natural lean deceleration
backfiring, so I run with it disconnected.

BTW, does anybody have the advance vs. rpm curves for a Bosch 0 231 184
003 distributor (stock on late '73 S)?  I'm just started getting an odd
lean spot at around 3800 rpm and the distributor is the primary suspect.
