RE : William Anders wanted to know what type of breakerlsee unit I am using and
how was the performance.

   The unit I am using is made by Igniter. My engine is a 76 2.7 with a Euro RS
distributor. I dont believe it is available for the older Bosch units. It was
purchased thru Paragon Products. They advertise in all The Porsche Mags. If they
dont have them, they can probably tell you who does.
   Installation was easy. Remove the old points, drop in the unit. Plug on the
Stator ring under the rotor. Connect two wires and time the engine.
   I installed mine at the same time as an MSD Ignition unit. I noticed an
immediate improvement in low speed running. Also the car started easier and
idled smoother.
