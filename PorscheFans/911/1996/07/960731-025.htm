Terry,

I'm no expert but I have told by others (Bruce you out there?) that you 
want to check the thermostat in hot oil, not water.  Not sure what water 
does to it but anyone out there know?

From Terry Shugart <tshugart@analogic.com>, on 7/31/96 4:08 PM:
What with the comments about oil temp as of late I decided to that the   
time while waiting for parts (doing an overhaul via mail order has its   
draw backs) to check the thermostats for my 75 2.7ltr.  I wouldn't call   
this rocket science but I measured the temp. of a pan of hot water and   
dropped the thermostats into the pan while mounted in their respective   
holders.  The thermostat mounted in the engine case opened at around 185F   
but the one for the loop cooler I've added didn't open until after 205F.   
 In checking my manual the only reference I could find said it shouldn't   
open until at least 181F but didn't give an upper limit for a functioning   
thermostat.  Does anyone know what the range should be?
TIA
