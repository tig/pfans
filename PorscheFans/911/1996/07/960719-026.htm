Questions from a new 911 owner (worked my way up through 914s and 944T)

My new bl/bl '87 Targa, which was an executive's "weekend" car, has 31K miles
on it, sport suspension, sport seats. Ltd slip, etc...
1) Could it be possible that I have original battery?  It looks original (or
at least factory) and is huge and turns car over well even after a week...

2) I believe my car has the dreaded  needle bearing/rubber clutch set up.
 But, clutch feels pretty silky smooth still, makes a little of typical G50
gear noise coming off idle - should I expect catastrophic type failure some
day or will I know when needle bearing  starts to go?  (I expect the latter)
 Will rubber pieces jam the clutch like with original SCs?

3) The car needs new stereo/speakers.  I want to retain STOCK
appearance/grills - can someone suggest speakers for front doors and rear
shelf?  Automotion has some Polk, will only fit through 1986 - what could be
that different about interior of 1987?  For bass I am considering adding
those new under-the-seat type bass augmenters?  

4) A.C. blows air that is only marginally colder than outside air.  I fear
compressor seals, etc., are dried out, previous owner said "I never really
used A.C", although he SHOULD have used it one a month....   Question:  Even
with a good A.C system, will the 911 (w/ later vents) actually stay cool?
 Also, if Freon doesn't bring it back to life, do I replace with similar
rotary or is there better?

5) What is a rational/incremental way to increase car to "Euro" hp or better.
 I don't want to do "test pipe" or replace perfectly good exhaust/exchangers
for time being.  There is K&N (good for anything?) and also those noisy cone
induction systems with k&Ns.  Also, so many chip choices, mass airflow sensor
sounds great and I've seen bigger throttle bodies.  Realistically, list
consensus of best chip combined with k&N?  

6) Finally, until I get my H1s (w relays I suppose) has anybody run H5s with
greater wattage bulbs?  I know that 9004 and 9006 bulbs (american cars) don't
work too well in higher wattages, and I am concerned about amperage through
headlight switch.  Or am I already "relayed"?

7) Can I add central locking?  I get conflicting advice on aftermarket
add-on, although Porsche did this in 1988.  Also, I am missing alarm keys - I
will see if I can get keys made.

P.S. Yes, it is possible to replace driver's side hood shock!  (long needle
nosed vice grips to push pin in from outside) and even new shock won't hold
up tail-less rear.

Thanks for your input,
