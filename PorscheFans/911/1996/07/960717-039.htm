Exactly.  I never did contribute, though I actually got around to addressing a
letter and writing the check, but Stan was supposed to do whatever he wanted
to with that money.  Remember, initially we were going to buy his 914 for him
so he could keep it when he was considering selling it to cover business losses.
Stan did a great service to several thousand people for about half a decade and
he deserves the leeway.  Where I am a bit pissed at him is regarding the fact 
that he doesn't seem to have made the least effort to inform those thousands 
who depended on him as to what happened to tta.com.  While I'm grateful for 
his letting me run my Web pages from there, I never heard the first word as to
whether they were gone forever, whether the list was ever coming back, etc.
Ah, well, as I said before, I can only be grateful for the service he did 
provide.
