It's a difficult situation isn't it? - A big company like Texaco can't be 
100% certain that it isn't their fault (what the hell are they talking 
about contamination analysis?) ... it just seems that when put into a 
position of liability everyone
just wants to pass the buck! -WHAT A JOKE! ...how about have an official or 
independent agency come out and randomly test the tanks and you retained 
sample? ... this shouldn't be done at any cost to yourself, as it appears 
to point towards the station...what was the last time you confused Unleaded 
with H2O? ... although I'm not a lawyer, this might be a start! -Go for it!

PFans,
Several months ago my '80 911SC developed trouble after my first autox.
Losing power, starting problems, etc. etc.
At the conclusion of the subsequent repair work it turned out that:
1. The fuel pump had rusted to the point that it wouldn't work at all.
2. The mechanic drained a gallon of water and crud out of the gas tank.
3. After miscellaneous related repairs the car is running well now.
4. The garage has suggested that since I have purchased all the gas for the
911 from Texaco (and 95% of it at the same station) via credit card so 
there
are records, that I try to get Texaco to reimburse me for the repairs.
5. I have contacted their consumer affairs division here in Houston who
passed me to an office in Atlanta, who is basically giving me the 
run-around,
as in "Our records show no contamination at that Texaco location, so we are
not liable."
6. Any suggestions on how to proceed with this, or whether to continue to 
at
all?
TIA,
George Bigham
p.s. Garage is holding on to the gallon jug of water-and-gorp for possible
analysis of contents.
p.p.s. If you know of someone on othe lists who has experience with this,
forwarding the message to them will be much appreciated, also...
