JJ:

Assuming that your oil pump, sender, and gauge are working properly
(and that your sender is properly calibrated to your gauge), the 
oil-temperature reading DOES accurately represent engine temperature.

On a 914/4, which normally holds about 4 quarts of oil, the addition
of an external cooler (especially one mounted up front, with long
lines to it) adds 20% or more to the total volume of oil.  It's not
surprising, therefore, that you've had such amazing results...
Significantly more oil + cooler oil = A 914 that runs almost cold.
