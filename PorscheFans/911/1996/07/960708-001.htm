	My Carrera 3.2 has a slightly notchy clutch. My dealers *guess* is that
this is a problem with the release bearing not being properly lubricated
within its tube. They recommend replacing it, and suggest that while they
are in there, they should replace the clutch as well (the car has 42k
miles on its original clutch, as far as I can tell). Their quote is 1,100
pounds (about the price of a complete early 924 :-) ), though many of the
specialists advertise clutch replacements in the PCGB magazine for around
600 pounds.

	They also tell me that if I continue to drive it like this, I could damage
the flywheel, costing another 200 pounds or so.

	I'm a bit reluctant to (a) go ahead on their "best guess" diagnosis and
(b) replace a clutch which doesn't (yet) need it. While the clutch is a bit
notchy, it's not so bad that I can't live with it.

	Any suggestions from P'philes (woops, P'Fans) as to what I should do?

regards,
Philip Katz                   <KatzPM@empire.bt.co.uk>
