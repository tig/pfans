I couldn't find the final report, but this oughta do...  Note the dates.
And for those interested, the Faire Dora has beaten the cancer and is
doing well.  Those of you so inclined might include Colleen Blue in your
prayers...

and Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart, noticing that he has a free moment for the first 
time since before the recent holidays, decides to spend it on his Phriends.

Hi Pholks.  Be of good cheer!  In late December I sent our beloved Listmeister
a check from you generous Patrons and Members in the amount of $10,2xx.xx.

On Tuesday (yesterday), Stan told me that he's taking the rest of the week off
to install the new hardware and software (the sound of cheering from phrustrated
Porschephiles around the world drowns out the rest of Unka Bart's message...)

I'm sure that Stan will brief us all on the details as soon as time permits (You
*would* rather he spent the time he has available doing, rather than telling; 
now wouldn't you...?)

If any Contributor (Member or Patron) missed the custodian's report with the
shiny numbers, be patient please and I will send out another as soon as the 
"stuff" settles in my own life.  This may be a couple of months more.

Please, DO NOT SEND ME MONEY NOW!!!  With the check I sent Stan, the account was
emptied and closed!

For those who are wondering what "stuff" is, my beloved Dora is in the midst of 
a fight against a rare and painful cancer.  For those *MANY* of you who both 
know and care, and who sent me supportive messages, I have not forgotten you, 
and am very grateful for your support.  You will be pleased to hear that she's 
doing very well, but still has a rocky, painful road to travel before the edge 
of the woods comes into view.  I am convinced that she *will* make it, and her 
spirits are very high!

Cheers

(yer Kindly ol' Unka) Bart

Frau Dora, 
(fond memory of a couple of little feline varmints in my heart)
'86 Indischrot Carrera Cabriolet, 
'87 Alpenweis Syncro.
FORMERLY Custodian, Porschephiles Phund
