BMW dominated GTS2.  The first three pole positions were BMW factory cars 1, 
Kevin Buckler, Porsche 911 in 2 and BMW factory car in 3.  The 3rd positon 
Beemer jumped Buckler at the start and it was BMW, 1st and 2nd for almost all 
of the race.  Buckler and another 911(light blue one with a mid engine motor) 
were battling it out for 3rd place for most of the race and another BMW 
factory car was behind them in fifth place for all but the last few laps when 
he easily blew by both of them between turns 6 and 7.  Pretty obvious what his 
marching orders were. BMW 1,2,3.  It's amazing what you can do if you spend a 
buncha bucks.  BMW factory kicked the bejesus out of some independent Porsche 
racers on mostly limited budgets. 
 
I hadn't been to an IMSA event in a long time and while I was there I was 
reminded why.  It was like going to an SCCA regional weekend with faster cars 
and bigger egos but not necessarily better drivers.  There were some real 
'pro' pros there, mixed in with with a bunch of grass roots guys, some of whom 
were having a good time. Others were just signing checks. 
 
The WC cars were pretty impressive speed wise and had some real talent. 
They ran a 3 hour enduro in the same race group as the GTS1 group an made them 
look pretty slow when they really weren't.  I hate it when 'professional' 
racing mixes classes like this.  
 
And it's still true what they say about the difference between NASCAR and 
IMSA.  In NASCAR, the fans know the names of all the drivers, In IMSA, the 
drivers know the names of all the fans....... 
 
It's obvious why.......

(Gee, I must be in a snarky mood today.....I just hate spending 30 bucks to 
see 'pro' anything that doesn't provide me with at least 10 bucks worth of 
value.)
