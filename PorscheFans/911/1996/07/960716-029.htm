Jim:

Your friend has the dreaded 915 disease.  The engaging teeth on 1st and/or
2nd gears pop off of the hub that they are made on.  When the teeth pop off,
the syncro ring is no longer captive and expands.  The slider that moves when
you shift the car that engages these little teeth car no longer move towards
the offending gear because the syncro is now in the way.  Doesn't really
matter that it can't, since even if it could, there are no longer any teeth
left to lock up the gears anyway.  (I think that makes sense.)

Anyway, he can confirm this as being the problem by draining the gear oil.
 On the magnetic plug will be stuck most of these little teeth.

Don't suggest that he drives the car very far.  Have seen the syncro that is
no longer held in place run through the gears, through other gears, and
through the transmission cases.  (The problem can get much worse if ignored.)

When he has the transmission fixed, make sure that the rebuilder replaces the
engaging teeth for 2nd gear at the same time, regardless of what they look
like.  We have seen perfect teeth come off in a few thousand miles.  They
apparently get brittle and then they come off.  All of the 915 transmissions
since 1976 have this problem, have had this problem, or will have this
problem. (Since 915-60 and 915-61 transmisions.)
