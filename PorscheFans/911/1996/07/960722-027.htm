Yes, I caught your drift, I only run fuel into the cab for
short tests only....

Gas does some unplessent things to various metals, and
unless the proper materials are used, I think exposure could cause
failure from corrosion, or some other polymer problems....
Because of this, I would use a gas pressure sender for an
oil pressure sender, but not the other way.  I think
the issolator is the way to go, and I have thought
about putting a pressure sensor on my various cars
before, but never seen an electric fuel pressure
sender.  Don't know why, of if I just missed it...


This has got to be my last comment, I'm gone till Monday.

Later -

My "From wpcallah@tddcae99" as mailed from here is wrong.
