     PFans:
     
     I recently returned from my third visit to Driver's Ed at Watkins 
     Glen, an exhilarating track I would recommend to one and all. I drove 
     a '95 993 with the usual mixture of street gear and track mods. Aside 
     from my general slowness in getting around this very challenging 
     circuit, I encountered one problem I'd like guidance on: As I approach 
     the fast downhill that marks the entrance to the Toe of the Boot, I 
     downshift from fourth to third gear to prepare for the uphill 
     righthander that causes everyone's car to lug and chug. My problem is 
     this: My downshift coincides with a dip in the track that's near the 
     turn-in point. The result is a small but distinct "crunch" in the 
     tranny. None of the other 993 drivers I talked to last weekend had 
     this problem. My car is also considerably stiffer than theirs: It has 
     a suspension derived from the Supercup and GT-2 race cars. Am I seeing 
     the first signs of a weak synchro, or, as someone suggested, is chasis 
     flex causing the transmission to get momentarily out of alignment? Is 
     there a fix for this, short of a) going to horrendously noisy 
     full-race, metal engine and transmission bushings or, perhaps, 
     switching to steel synchros a la the Supercup cars. All list wisdom 
     welcomed on this point. (Note: This doesn't happen anywhere else I 
     run--Summit Point, Mid-Ohio, etc.).
