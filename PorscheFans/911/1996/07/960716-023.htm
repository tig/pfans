Hi Mike... I'm doing the install this weekend...  The only problems have been the
truly massive C2 exhaust that HAS to go (look at B&B or SSI).  Couple it with a Patrick
Flywheel, engine studs, harness, and you have a reasonable install.  

The car is otherwise stock except for Koni's all around, Weltmeister 26mm tors bars 
(the 3.6 is a bit heavier than the 2.7 ;)! ) and Welt sway bars.

I anticipate that the exhaust will at 10-15 horse to the ample 247 stock.  In a 2800 pound car, I anticipate
that this should be a rocket!

Hey,

Sorry, I don't have any experience with gel batteries, but I do have a
question.  How
the heck did you fit a 3.6 in your '77?  What are you using for a gearbox?

I have a '76 that has a good chance of finding something other than a 2.7 under
the decklid one of these days and would like to know how the 3.6 has worked
out.

What other mods does your car have?

Thanks,
