PFans,
Several months ago my '80 911SC developed trouble after my first autox.
Losing power, starting problems, etc. etc.
At the conclusion of the subsequent repair work it turned out that:
1. The fuel pump had rusted to the point that it wouldn't work at all.
2. The mechanic drained a gallon of water and crud out of the gas tank.
3. After miscellaneous related repairs the car is running well now.  
4. The garage has suggested that since I have purchased all the gas for the
911 from Texaco (and 95% of it at the same station) via credit card so there
are records, that I try to get Texaco to reimburse me for the repairs.
5. I have contacted their consumer affairs division here in Houston who
passed me to an office in Atlanta, who is basically giving me the run-around,
as in "Our records show no contamination at that Texaco location, so we are
not liable."
6. Any suggestions on how to proceed with this, or whether to continue to at
all?
TIA,
George Bigham
p.s. Garage is holding on to the gallon jug of water-and-gorp for possible
analysis of contents.
p.p.s. If you know of someone on othe lists who has experience with this,
forwarding the message to them will be much appreciated, also...

To all fans of sports car racing from the late '50s/early '60s:

We just bought a really cool video of sports car racing in California from the
late 1950s through the very early '60s, called _Hay Bales and Asphalt_.  There
are lots of Porsches (356 <including Speedsters and Carrera Speedsters>,
 RS60, RSK, etc.)  There are also Scarabs, Jags, Mercedes, Old Yellers, MGs, 
Corvettes (including the 1st Stingray and one of the CERVs), etc.  Drivers
shown: Dan Gurney, Lance Reventlow, Stirling Moss, Jo Bonier, Jim Clark, Phil
Hill, Max Belchowski (sp?), Carroll Shelby, etc.  Cameo celebrity appearances
by Jill St. John, David Niven, Jayne Mansfield.  My husband's uncle, Ted
Conrad, raced in that series in that era, driving Carrera Speedsters (and 
other cars).  Not sure if we saw him or not, it wasn't always easy to see the
vehicle numbers.  Race tracks shown: Laguna, Vaca Valley, Pomona, Riverside...

The race footage has been nicely restored.  Much better than other old racing
footage I've seen.  Intelligently narrated.  All in all, a really enjoyable
video.  It's really cool to see many of the cars that are still being run on
the Historic race circuit.  Now I'm madder then ever that I can't make it to
Laguna Seca this August!!!  The guy who made it, Clark Smith, seems like a 
really nice guy, too.

It's available from Inside Line, (415) 595-3580 (San Carlos, CA).  The video
cost $40.  Even though it is short (30 min.), I think it was worth every penny.

I'm not connected with Inside Line, I'm just a happy customer.

Enjoy!
