Thanks to everyone who has replied to my question regarding the accuracy
of the relationship between oil temp and engine head temp.  About half
of the replies indicated that if the oil was being measured from the
original oil temp sensor location (as opposed to somewhere down the line
by the oil cooler), that  the oil temperature would accurately reflect
the engine head temp.  However, the other half disagreed with this, and
stated several examples in which the oil temp stays nice and cool, but
the cylinder heads get quite hot.  Since I'm not too sure how to go
about measuring the engine head temp, nor do I know how or where to hook
up another head temp sensor, nor would I know what "acceptable" head
temps are, I need to know if there are other ways to cool the heads
down.  Please keep in mind that my income is quite limited.  How
effective would things like taping the edges of the engine tin and
plugging the holes to the spark plugs be?

Thanks again!
