JJ:

Got the following response from Bruce Anderson, so I'm forwarding it 
to the list.

Hi Andy,

I don't think that I agree with your summary of oil temperature equals
engine temperature. You can have a good oil cooler and cool the engine
oil and still have cylinder heads that are too hot. The example that I
used was the new 964 and 993 engines where they have a great front
mounted oil cooler with a big fan and great air circulation. The oil
temperature in these cars runs cool except in some extreme conditions,
yet the engines do run hot and we have seen excessive valve guide wear
with these engines.

So oil temperature won't directly tell you the "engine
temperature"... Sorry for any confusion my previous message might 
have caused.

However, if you install an external cooler and find that your
oil-temp gauge now shows a significant drop in temperature, it's
probably safe to say that your "engine temperature" (no matter how
you define it) has dropped significantly as well.
