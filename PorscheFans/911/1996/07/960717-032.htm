OK...  Um, you need to chill out- I wasn't accusing YOU of any wrong doing.
If I were you, I would be mad as hell that Stan took the $10K that you spent
your time collecting to give us a better Porschephiles, and now have nothing
to show for it!  So don't get mad at me- people have been asking ME for a
while what ever happened to the money and I decided to ask the list if anyone
knew- am I not allowed to ask a simple question like where's the $10K that
was sent to Stan to fix Porschephiles, now that Porschephiles doesn't exist?!!!
I don't think that is such a horrendous question- to clarify: I wasn't
questioning the kosherness of the Phund, but the person who took the money.
Geesh, everyone is so eager to flame around here!
