The separate lists make it easy to sort out information that is not relevant.  
However, a significant % of the messages sent on this list are not specific to a
particular model.  Perhaps we need a new category "ALL", so that we don't get 
multiple instances of non-model specific messages (such as this one).

Hi Paul,

I for one prefer the model specific postings.  It is less time (and
space) consuming to get the information that I really want.  I believe
that this was a problem for a lot  of people on the old list and caused
them to unsubscribe.  I think we need the greatest number of contributors
we can get.  Maybe some of them will come back to the fold now.

As for the people posting to all three groups when the post is model
specific, that's almost spamming in my book.  I really didn't care about
the 924 water pump or thermostat or whatever.  I would have subscribed to
that group.  924/944/928/356's are all fine cars, afterall, they're
PORSCHES, but I prefer the spend my time and disk-space on my preferred 911.

My 2 Pfennig,

-Bill Tomko

BTW,  the only reason that this is posted to all three lists is the
automated reply function on my mailer.
