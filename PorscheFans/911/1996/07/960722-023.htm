That's a good point (the pulsations issue). I had a Summit "Made in
Germany" mechanical fp gauge fail (started leaking all over the manifoold
of a non-Pcar), and my guess is that the vibrations did it in, even though
it was clearly made for measuring EFI fuel pressures (scale to 60psi). It
was mounted in-line with the cold-start injector, and you could feel the
pulsations if you held the fuel line between your fingers.

I have a similar gauge in my PCA-to-be 914-4 2.0, but it's mounted at the
output side of my FRAM fuel filter, in the front "trunk", far from the
injectors.  I'd like to avoid another such failure, so that's why I'm
asking around.

Thanks for the reply.
