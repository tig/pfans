Woah!  Yes, I am implying that there is something fishy about $10K being given
to someone who has taken it in the good faith that it will be used to better
the functionality and longevity of Porschephiles and all of a sudden the list
and the money disappears!  That's all I was asking about!  Several people on
several lists have found this situation fishy, unfortunately I was the one to
open my mouth and finally ask the question publicly that everone was talking
about in private.  And after all of this flaming the question still has not
been answered!  I'm sorry if I somehow offended you, I wasn't aming at your
integrity.  But the question still remains- can anyone tell me what happened
to the $10K that was supposed to buy us a better functioning Porschephiles?!
