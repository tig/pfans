Those with early MFI's might be interested in what it apparently 
takes to pass the WA State emissions test.  The situation with both 
my '72E and '72T was the same, so I think there is some statistical 
certainty to my experience.

Both cars had freshly rebuilt engines, with less than 2K or 3K 
miles.  Both cars required me to lean out the midrange 
adjustment (clockwise, if I remember correctly) some 10 to 12 
clicks.  At that point, the car runs like sh*&%t.  It bucks, backfires, 
can't idle worth beans, and in general is virtually undriveable.  
But it passes the test with honors.  (In WA State the test consists of 
checks at idle, and a loaded dynamometer check at 3000 rpm or so.)  

They ran so poorly when adjusted to pass, that I had to practice 
putting foot pressure on the accelerator so they wouldn't stall 
during the idle test.

A block away from the test site, I adjusted them back 10-12 clicks, 
and they ran just fine. 

Great test, isn't it.
