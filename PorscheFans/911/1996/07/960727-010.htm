Phriends,

I've been warned that when I put a Turbo 3.6 brake kit on my '91 C4 I won't
be able to use the stock spare tire in times of need -- it won't clear the
new larger calipers.

What spare do I need, or can I use?

Looking for a 3.6 Turbo part, Stoddard says that after 1992 the C2 Turbo
and the C2/C4 all used the same spare with a part number of 965.362.030.01
(now "retroceded" to 00).  I've also located a used spare from an 1993 RS
America that has a part number on it of 928.362.030.02. Or, I could also
get my hands on the spare from a 1996 twin tubo (too bad that's all I could
get :") that has a part number of 965.362.130.00.

Well ... I can't try the fit (haven't done the upgrade yet) or measure
offsets (the spares are at various places around the USA). So much for the
scientific method.

Do you happen to have a strongly held belief about which of these spare
opportunities may or may not work offset and size-wise on my old C4 with
juicy red calipers?

Thanks
-Ez Goldman
1991 C4
