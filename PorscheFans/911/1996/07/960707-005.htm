Hello Porsche Car Enthusiasts!

I have a slight leak on the left side of my timing chain cover.  I'm wondering
if the cover can be removed w/o removing the engine or muffler? has anyone 
replaced their gaskets for this area and can you shed some light on what would
be involved in terms of trying to replace them while the engine is in the car? 

I guess I could try to tighten up the nuts a little and see if it helps.
The other
side is bone dry and I guess I could really live with the few drops if I had
to.  I've noticed that the oil leaks a little more when using a 5w oil
rather than a 10w...does this sound reasonable or is it just in my head and
the gasket is getting worse?

The car is a 1987 Carrera.  I would also have to replace the o-rings for the
return
oil tubes as well...guess it's the collapsible ones this time! (are they
reliable?)

Looking to live with a bone dry 911...or tolerate a few drops of 5w-50 syntec!
