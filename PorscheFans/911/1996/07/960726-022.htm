Vintage Air has a 1 800 line, which is 800-TO-COOL-U, which I interpret as 
1 800 862 6658, they also have a fax line of (210) 654 3113.

The compressors they sell have the pulley and clutch assembly as part of 
the unit, the brackets they sell are either for hot rods or they are 
universal brackets. There is a company called International Conditioning 
Enterprises which sells A/C stuff for Porsche, but their prices are a bit 
higher. They sell the complete mount unit for about $289 (which strikes me 
as a bit stiff). Their number is 1 800 845 0424.

On sizing, from what I have been able to gather to this date, one is better 
off with a larger amount of condeser capacity mated to a smaller 
compressor, within reasonable limits, than trying to get more cooling by 
using a larger compressor. Idea is to cool the refrigerant as much as 
possible, there being little advantage to greater compressor capacity once 
the compressor has turned the refrigerant into liquid. Using this logic, I 
was going for the smaller Sanden (5 cu in), partly as my need for A/C is 
low here in the Great White North. I also wanted to save a few kg of 
weight, considering that I have gone to some lenghts to reduce weight in 
the ol' Porkchop.....

If you have any other questions, feel free to post...I'd be happy to pass 
on what I have been able to learn to date...
