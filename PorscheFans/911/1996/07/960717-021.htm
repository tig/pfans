Sean rather snidely enquires:

> What ever happened to all of the money that was collected in the 
> Porschephiles Phund?  Hmmm...

and Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart, takes a moment from his work to repeat what he
reported back at the end of December, 1995.  A check for $10,200 and change
was mailed to Stan Hanks on or about the 29th of December in order to close
out the account so that I would not have my name on it going into the new
year.  That check represented every cent contributed, along with accumulated 
interest (on which *I* paid income taxes.)

Unfortunately, I can't find a copy of my final report, but if you, or anyone 
else is interested in pursuing this matter, you may call the bank yourself, or 
enquire directly of Stan.

If you want to check with the bank to see that this is on the up and up, call
(Cathy Laster, the bank officer who set-up the account is no longer with the 
bank, but you may check with) any bank officer at the number below.  This 
information was included in each and every custodian's report, and frankly, I 
resent and am personally offended by your implication that something was not 
kosher with the phund.

Account Name  Porschephiles 
acct.# 3933150532 
NationsBank, Crofton Office 2227 
Defense Highway Crofton, MD  21114
