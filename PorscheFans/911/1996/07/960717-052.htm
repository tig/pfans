    Well, yes and no.  At the risk of getting off-topic, I should
    point out that shorter springs and reduced suspension travel are
    only necessary if you're lowering the car by using the most
    common method: Installing short springs.  There ARE other ways,
    you know...

    The guy who started this thread (geez... I don't even remember
    who he was) was asking, as I recall, about using STIFFER
    springs, not necessarily about using SHORTER springs.  While I
    agree that lowering the car will improve its performance, I'm
    not sure that this discussion is precisely applicable to his
    original question.

    You're right to recommend adjusting the spring perches so the
    springs don't uncouple... This is vastly preferable to letting
    the springs rattle around at full droop.

    However... While I agree that, for this guy, the reduced
    suspension travel that will result from this adjustment "ain't
    nuttin to worry about", it's still less desirable than having
    the maximum travel allowed by the suspension AND the stiffer
    springs AND a lower ride-height.  

    I guess I was only trying to show what the IDEAL situation would
    be... Obviously, issues like cost and complexity will dictate
    what real people in the real world will be able to achieve.
