Dear 'Fans,

I was all set to tackle a valve adjustment on my '88 911, but found that I
was unable to get a spark plug socket on the #3 (??I think??) plug.  It's
the most forward plug on the right engine side.  My 6" extension with spark
plug socket was too long to fit in the spark plug hole without comming into
contact with the surrounding body work.  It would be even longer with a
spark plug on the end.  I was going to try two 4" extensions with a swivel
in the middle, but that seemed a bit precarious.  I guess my question is,
is there a preferred tool or a "secret" to getting that plug out?  Also, is
it recommended to use a "locking" type socket to hold the spark plug socket
onto the extension?  Thanks for your help!

Ron Bolsky
