<< I'm putting together a trip to San Diego during which I hope
 to buy a 911sc and drive it back to Colorado. I have a few questions:
 	what do I need to do as far as emissions, and plates on the
 	car, so I can drive it home?

Ans.  I don't think emmissions, at least relative to CA should bother you
because you aren't going to register the car here. I would use the existing
plates and bring the signed off title and bill of sale with me on the trip
back to CO. BTW, if you time this right, you can stop by the vintage races at
Steamboat over Labor Day.
 
 	what are some reputable shops in San Diego where I can get a
 	car checked out?

Ans. Call Joe Vampola at European Motorsports (619) 599-9307 and tell him I
  referred you. BTW, while he may not want to do a public endorsement, our
fearless leader also knows Joe.
 
 	Any advice on transferring funds? I don't want to carry $12k in cash
 
 This trip will be in mid-September. Wish me luck!
