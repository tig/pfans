Dennis:  Thanks for your help.... =20

Did you use the double clamp in the upper section (near the shock) or in =
the new hole that you drilled approx. 10" up?  Getting these lines to =
line up is a pain in the @$$!  It seems that the brass lines are bent as =
well, to make matters worse.  I also had to use the biggest wrenches and =
the strength of Hercules to loosen the bolts on the old trombone...

Thanks

David

Happy to oblige....

The "W" clamps share the same screw as the rocker panels.

On the subject of the front fender mounting, it apparently varies =
somewhat=20
from model to model. On my '75 I had to drill 1 hole (forgot about it in =
my=20
last post, the others were already in position. I don't think it matters =

too much, just make sure that you rust proof the cut edges and maybe =
give a=20
coating of some nice rust proofer when you are done...
