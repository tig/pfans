Is he sure it's not the synchros?  First and second are usually the ones 
to go.

This is where I start to wonder what college tuition you'll be 
financing.  12 to 14 hours seems way out of line.  I think your 5 is

much less by a real pro (or a real idiot who forgets to disconnect 
things, don't ask).
