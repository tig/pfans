Guys,

The best contact for Swepco products in the US is Pat DeWitt whose number is
916/488-1072.  The second best contact is Swepco international headquarters
in Texas at 817/332-2336 and their fax number is 817/877-4047.  Either Pat or
Swepco mail order all over the world.

We spent the weekend at Willow Springs with the BMW Club.  They were having a
driver's ed event and we were after some cheap track time to test out the
car.  With about 60 cars (including four Porsches) it was well run and anyone
who wanted one got one-on-one instructions from an instructor.  I've also
attended Alfa Romeo, Farrari and other marque events and have been impressed
at how welcome other car club people are to all of these events.  The BMW
people treated us like visiting dignitaries.  Anyway, if you're looking for
track time and/or instruction, don't overlook the opportunities that other
car clubs afford.

Monte
