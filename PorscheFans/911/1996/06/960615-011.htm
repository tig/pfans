          SUBJECT:   911 Chain Tensioner Failure
 
 
More information on what I thought may be a chain tensioner failure on my
911.
 
I removed all the spark plugs.  The plug for number 3 cylinder was very
difficult to remove.  When I did get it removed the electrode was gone, and
the ground pin was bent in.  These are the expensive platinum plugs for the
MFI cars.  Also, I am unable to rotate the crank, it will stop, when the
valve hits something (the cylinder?).
 
I also removed the cam covers to look at the tensioners, the sides look to
be out of sync.  Both sides are tight, could my problem be a stretched
chain, or the binding up of the chain wheel support.  Bruce A. says that
there is proof that the old style chain wheel support could bind up, and I
have the old style. Instead of updating them when I did the tensioners, I
bought the spacers instead.  I wanted to save the $160.00.  Could it have
been just motor fatigue, from old age?
 
Is a possibility, retiming the cams, and seeing if the car would start and
run?  Or, is it more likely damage has been done, and I just need to take
the engine apart and start a rebuild.
 
The motor has 103K on it, I truly expected to get 130K out of the motor
before I was going to even think about a rebuild.  If I do rebuild, I was
thinking of a 2.4 "E" motor, or a 2.7 "RS".  I plan on keeping the MFI, for
some reason I like it.  If I build a 2.7 motor, then I was going to source
out the 7R case, or I guess a 3.0 "RS" motor would be nice.
