To add to Mike's T*d FAQ:

Sociologists could study the T*d phenomenon for years and never truly
explain the genetics and environmental conditions necessary to
produce a T*d.

Even with Pete's and Ben's summaries, there is no way to capture
the amazing essence of a T*d thread.   He could not imagine the
possiblility that someone else might  know more about something than he.

T*d endured more situations that would utterly humiliate an average
person when shown in technicolor how clueless he really was  The beauty of it
was it would not phase him in the slightest!

The most fun was seeing T*d throw out his daily flat out assertion,
and watch someone actually try to *debate* it.  All of us veterans
gave it a shot at one point or another.    The very next day he would
present yet another indefensible position.  No statement was
too bizarre or illogical and no amount of evidence to the contrary
could budge him.  He was like a read-only AI program:  it could
not learn yet could produce amazing volumes of content almost
at random.

We knew we were in trouble when the first T*d postings started showing
up:  It was one of those "Hey I'm about to buy this car, tell me it's
a good idea" posts.  The car?  77 911 with 150k miles, smoke and oil
leaks.  Most of us got a sick feeling in our stomachs when we saw this,
but had no idea what we were in for.  In spite of several "RUN FOR YOUR
LIFE" warnings, he bought the car anyway, and the rest is history.

One of alleged T*d capers was that he was inspecting his
running engine one day and got his tie stuck in the fan !  He
simultaneously strangled himself and whacked his head on the decklid
until his girlfriend shut the car off.  Can anyone confirm this?
Rumor was that he was ACTUALLY EMBARASSED by this.

Didn't he bet _SCOTT WINDERS_ $10 that he could beat him and his
weenie overweight 911SC track car at an autox?  (the same event where Mark
Blaskovich and his wife beat him by open water in their bone stock 70T--on
their first ever autox event).  At this or a similar event he spun
his car on the course so many times that the PA announce began referring
to him as "Wing Commander T*d Matsamura" executing another barrel roll.

>From memory off the list:

A Porsche is a Porsche
Of course, of course
Unless of course,
it's the backwards Porsche,
of the famous Mr. T*d!
