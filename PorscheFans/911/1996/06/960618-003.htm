To start a discussion on fuel injection, I would like to know who has
experience with programmable fuel injection.
 
As stated in a previous post, I think I have dropped a valve in my '72 911T.
I have yet to get the motor out of the car and see the damage.  But, I have
been daydreaming about the type of motor to build.  My options are '72T (not
likely), '72E (likely, cost effective), 2.7RS with MFI, or I was thinking of
a 2.4 or 2.7 with Electromotive HPV-1 programmable fuel injection.  Not
looking for a pure track car, but, if I have to replace the throttle bodies
to upgrade to an "E" or "RS" motor, I may be able to install HPV-1 instead.
 
Does anyone know what the price would be for a 911 motor? I realize that I
would then have to program it for my engine.
 
By using HPV-1 or some other electronic fuel system, I feel that there would
be better drivability and fuel economy, and easier adjustment and control.
