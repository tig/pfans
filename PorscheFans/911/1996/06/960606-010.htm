That would still be cool, Bob probably doesn't even look at the speedo during
slaloms. I know I don't. Tach should still work. 

(I once wanted to disconnect the electric tail thingie on an earlier 911.
Found the fuse and found it also kills the tach or speedo, forget which).

Yeah, I figure all ABS systems are electrical and must be fused somehow. If
the fuse blows you would still have to have braking action, for legal reasons
if nothing else. (Brake by wire is a scary thought to me...)

Knowing that, it is likely that with a bit of experimentation, somebody who
is handy with electrical stuff can install a real professional looking ABS
kill switch in an unused switch position on the dash or center console (there
are some unused knockout plugs there, I think.)
