          SUBJECT:   911's and Baby Seats
 
 
Paul Wiatroski asked about baby seat fitment in 911's.  This is another of
the age old questions that get asked about every few months.
 
Depending on the age of the child, there are different possibilities.
 
I purchased seat belts for the rear of my 911, that did not have any when I
bought it, so that I could install my child's car seat.
 
For the few times that I drove my daughter around in the 911, I was able to
use the existing car seat that I had.  I had a Century 2600 seat, to install
it in the 911 I removed the rear cross bar, by removing one bolt.  This
allowed the seat to fit in the cupped rear seats.  After threading the lap
belt through the rear of the seat, the belt would tighten up to prevent the
seat from moving.  I had to use this setup for a while, even past the point
of where she was too heavy and tall to fit comfortably in the seat.
 
Sometimes I would mount the seat on the passenger seat, and this worked
well.  Now she is at the age and size where she fits into the rear seat so I
do not have this problem, and now the three of us can ride in the car (when
I fix the motor, which dropped a valve the other week).
 
I would not trust this setup for a permanent solution, or to use for a long
trip, but for running around town it worked fine.  I do have reservations
about using car seats in 911's, it seems that there is nothing available in
the USA that will work.  I took the 911 to Toys-R-Us, one night, and tried
several different car seats, none of them worked as well as the Century
seat, which was far from perfect.  I do not think that I jeopardized my
daughters safety, no worse than the situation she was in normally.  On my
911 I put her in the rear passenger seat, which is next the oil tank on a
1972 911, I did not want to think about getting hit on that side and having
hot oil everywhere.
 
On my daily driver, it only has 2 lap belts in the rear, so she had to ride
next to the passenger door, luckily the car does have child safety locks on
the rear doors, else she would have opened the door my now.  My wife's car
does have 3 lap belts in the rear, so the car seat was belted in using the
middle belt.
 
The other possibility, is to have someone in Europe purchase the Porsche
factory child seat for you in England or Germany.  Due to safety/liability
laws Porsche will not sell the car seat in the USA, but you can have it
imported/sent to you as a personal item.  I understand it is expensive
(~$150.00), and is purchased in 3 parts, you get the parts depending on how
old the child is.  The younger the child the more parts you need.  Kind of
like a booster seat, with additional support for younger children.
 
If your child is young enough, it might pay to get this seat.  Then you can
justify the expense.  There was a E-Mail sent out by someone on the
Porschephiles list several months ago, who was in Germany and was able to
purchase the seat, he described the pieces needed, and cost.
 
You could try to put an add in "PANO", and see if someone has a factory seat
available.
