I am looking for some factory seat rails for a 73 911 Targa.  I need both
the drivers and passenger sides.  The aftermarket seats and rails in the
car now were designed for small/petite individuals.  Under a previous
owner, a large friend of mine bent the drivers side rails at a drivers ed. 
Since I am also of the large persuasion, I was told that I should get the
factory rails because they were more robust.  I have purchased a set of
seats, but I need some rails to mount them.  The seats are Recarro's that
came out of a later model 911.  I have the necessary brackets to mount
newer seats to the old rails, but I don't have the rails.  Any help or
information would be appreciated.
