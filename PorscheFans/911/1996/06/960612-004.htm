The 964 series cars were a significant improvement over the 88's. The 
3.6 engine, the power steering (no loss of feel but a lot less 
kickback) and much better AC. The front suspension went to coil overs 
which improved ride and handling too.

Unless you really need AWD, I'd stick to the C2 version. Lighter, 
much less understeer on the track and much cheaper to maintain. The 
mechanical AWD system is complicated and when the center clutch goes, 
you'll need to take out a mortgage to pay for it.   I loved mine on 
the road but it was not much fun on the track due to the understeer. 

Be wary of early cars. As I recall, they had the infamous "no gasket 
heads".  I believe the factory fixed them under extended warranty but 
if not, you're in for an expensive job.  This was covered in 
Excellence one or tow issues ago. Bruce Anderson covered it in his 
valuation of 911's and supplied engine numbers before and after the 
change.  I'd make sure that I got one after the factory went back to 
proper gaskets and sealing rings or, one that was modified to the 
correct setup by an authorized dealer.

I bet someone on this list will provide more complete info.  As 
usual, buy as late a model as you can, there were continued 
improvements through the series.

Good luck and I'm sure you'll enjoy your new car.

Bob
