Bob,

Thanks for the feedback.  I read your comments to Pete and would simply note
that no brake system works well on bumps and ABS does better than most.  I do
know that at the IMSA SuperCar race on the streets of New Orleans last year,
I was able to outbrake almost everyone there and that's what kept us in the
race.  As you might imagine, it was a bit bumpy.

I didn't understand your next point but, if I'm reading it correctly, you are
right - locking up the brakes inhibits the driver's ability to maneuver the
car and, as ABS doesn't lock up the wheels (well it does, but it's
miliseconds at a time and the driver doesn't know it), it's a great system if
you are in trouble.  Further, if your front wheels are pointing off road, it
doesn't matter what your braking system, you are going off road.

You really know how to hurt a guy!   Here I thought I had a race car and now
I find that, because I've got ABS, I don't.  Tell me it isn't so <G>.  Barry
and Kevin are correct in that F1 doesn't have ABS only because it isn't
allowed.  Three years ago, Williams tried to get it approved again and again
it was shot down.  And, if the Porsche RSR, GT-2 and the new GT-1 aren't race
cars, I'm in good company.

I was serious about trail braking at Mosport.  My first three laps I did the
conventional thing and got my braking done before the top of the hill.  It
took that long to find out that if I was going to continue that way I would
be passed by the Calloway Corvette, the Lotus Esprit and the Saleen Mustangs
(all of which have ABS (not really sure about the fords)) and since we
weren't there to be passed, I changed my patterns.  It's a lot more hairy
that way and a good stock of Depends is not a bad idea - but, it's faster
and, contrary to something I read on the list the other day, if you are not
going 10/10s at all times on the track you are wasting a great deal of time
and not having the fun you are after.  And, go ahead and teach them the use
of controlled oversteer - they will love you for it!  (Be sure they sign the
waiver first <g>.)

Sorry, I do not miss the flames, the out-of-control language and I haven't
even misssed not hearing about cup holders.  I think it's great that you and
I can disagree on something and present our points of view without demeaning
each other or resorting to sophomoric verbage.  I like this list much better
as I sense you do.  (However, as ol' what's his name is going to LeMans
without us, we should be able to do something to mess this up while he's gone
- nez pas???)

Barry asked about racing ABS.  We cannot find a series number on our black
box (not aluminium).  The twin turbo came with ABS 5 and we upgraded to the
racing version.  In order to get it we had to prove that we were in a pro
series and, as the pin system had to be changed, sign a document that said we
wouldn't show anyone how to change them . . . knowing Andial as I do, it's
possible we paid $1800 and all we had to do was change the pins.  I think
that the difference in each new version of the Bosch system is the ability of
the brain to cycle the brakes faster and to reset the system quicker.  In
that I have difficulty changing the oil, all I really know is that it works.

I think that's everything I ever knew about ABS and it's back to work to try
and pay for my "hobby."  Thanks Guys!
