I agree.  Steady-state, the torque should be same at each end of the
extension.

Well, I'm not going to fire away, but I will relate something interesting.  I
saw some data once that compared the axial load in fasteners torqued
with lubricant and without.  The *range* of the values was almost exactly
the same (that is the maximum amount that axial loads varied), the
lubricated fasteners statistically were grouped much tighter to the avg.
value, though.

Moral of the story; it doesn't make a heckuva lot of difference.  It is good
practice, though, to make sure the threads are clean and a bit of anti-
seize is very often a good thing.  As I have said before, don't be too
concerned with the accuracy of your torque wrench.  Torquing fasteners
is a crap shoot at best.  The only thing a good torque wrench will do
for you is to ensure that you have applied a particular torque to the
fastener - that has very little to do with whether or not the correct axial
load was induced in said fastener (the whole reason for torquing in the
first place).
