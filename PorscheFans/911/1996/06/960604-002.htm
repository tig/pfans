Hello All,

I am wondering if any of you could give me some advice.  I am in need of
performing some brake work on my '79 911SC.  It is in dire need of new pads
and rotors and I am debating attempting it myself.  I am capable of
mechanical work (I rebuilt the wastegate on my 931 and installed SSI's on
this car years ago)  I have looked through the Haynes manual, but it didn't
seem to clear to me.  Normally, i would just start to pull some things off,
but since if I screw up the brakes, well, that would be bad.

Have any of you accomplished this yourselves?  Is this a difficult job to
perform at home if you have all the basic tools?  Are there any special
tools needed?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated....

Chris Rose

PS, Does anyone know what happened to Porschephiles??
