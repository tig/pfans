>2) Dwell Meter.  I don't think these are particularly
useful.  The dwell is determined by the point gap, which
is awfully simple to set with a feeler gauge.

I disagree. Not everybody has just the right feel to set the point gap
accurately with a feeler gauge; you have to have the right tension on the
feeler and also still have the rubbing block contacting the cam, but if you
put too much tension on things the arms of the points will deflect slightly
and throw all your careful measurements off. Also if there is any pitting of
the points the feeler gauge will be inaccurate. After setting gap with a
gauge, I always check it with a meter and often as not find it's not right
and need to try again. Once set, these things seem to stay set for a long,
long time.
