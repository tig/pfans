A few weeks ago we had a dialog about the M030 Sport Chassis option 
on the C4S. I finally got the straight answer from PCNA. This applies 
to all North American models i.e. Canada and US.

Here's what I got from PCNA in response to my question "why did I buy 
the M030 when it seems to come on the 4S as standard?"

            M030 Sports Chassis Option for C4S

The 911 C4S comes with 911 Turbo suspension and brakes and Turbos 
come with sport chassis settings. How is this possible?

The 1996 Turbo does indeed have stiffer springs, shocks, antisway 
bars and larger brakes than the C2/C4. The C4S uses the Turbo package 
except for C4 antisway bars (20 mm Front and 17mm Rear).

The M030 Sport Chassis option is stiffer still. Springs and shocks 
are identical to 911 Carreras with the M030. Antisway bars are 
upgraded to 22mm Front and 18 mm Rear.  These are not the stiffest 
bars Porsche offers but they match the chassis dynamics of the C4S 
very well.  The C4S weighs only 22 lbs more than a normal C4.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, we were all correct, the C4S comes with the Turbo suspension 
(except for sway bars) but the M 030 sport chassis is stiffer still 
and is optional ofall C2 and C4 models.
