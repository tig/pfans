          SUBJECT:   911 Chain Tensioner Failuer
 
 
I need to be reminded, what does a 911 chain tensioner failure sound like!
 
I pulled my car out of the garage to wax it (it ran for about 2 minutes).
Then about an hour later I started it again to pull it in.  After running
for about 2 minutes it started to make a god awful noise.  Like a gattlin
gun, or a terrible timing problem.  This is on a car that has 1 1/2 year old
pressure feed tensioners on it.  I did remove the tensioners 6 months ago,
to replace the "O" rings behind the cam nuts.
 
How do I check the tensioners.  When I remove the covers, does it typically
look ovious?  I assume that I remove both of them, and see how much spring
they have.  Can I rotate the motor, if it rotates completely without any
interferance, then does that mean that my valves are OK?  If not, then I
guess I get to remove my heads.
 
A few weeks ago, I had a problem with the ignition.  I never found the
problem, but it probably was a bad electrical connector.  After checking
everything, and reconnecting, the car started.  Could this be a bad ignition
problem, maybe the car is only hitting on 2 or 3 cylinders?
