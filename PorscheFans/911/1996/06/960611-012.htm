Greetings P-nuts,
Help is requested...
a couple of days ago Jim Stapleton asked about a particular serial number
and I responded;
>>>
>>Jim,
>>According to my Stoddard's guide; #9113102819 is possibly a'73 T, 2.4liter
>>CIS coupe possibly (originally) fitted with a sporto.  The sequence starts
>>at 9113101501 for CIS cars, but no final serial number is listed for this
>>run and the next run (for the '73 E models) starts at 9113200001,  and the
>>'73 S models start at 911330001...no, this number does not belong to a
>>targa, as those sequences start with #911311xxx, as opposedto
>>911310xxx.(and so on...)
>>So, if this thing is a targa...something's hosed up...
>>
>>I got all this out of the back of Stoddard's  911 catalogue...so, if you
>>find out that this is erroneous data for whatever reason -please tell me
>>and I'll cease to refer to it.
>>
>>
And then Perry S. spoke up with this:
>Tom:

>Doesn't match "The Porsche Family Tree" booklet which used to be available

>

Hmmm...now I'M curious.  I think this is too big a discrepancy between what
OUGHT to be good sources of data; (the Porsche Family tree and the chart in
the back of Stoddard's catalogue)

I don't mind at all being wrong...I'd just like to know which end is up.

So, is there anyone else out there that can set the record straight here?
where can somone get accurate serial numbers?
I think perhaps the Stoddard's chart might just be the culprit here...any
thoughts?

Cheers
Thom Kuby
