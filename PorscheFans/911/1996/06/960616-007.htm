Woe is me, woe is me! Jeezz guys, have you ever gotten in the back of 
your 911 somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 times? That it was a Targa 
helped some, but not really all that much. I can tell you this much: 
after the thirtieth time it becomes painful.
So what exactely was the problem, you ask. Well, I was trying to adjust 
the shiftlever at the shift rod coupling. This after having posted a 
question about difficult 2nd gear engagement. The Haynes manual is in 
this instance, as in so many others, absolutely enigmatic. I was advised 
by the list that the adjustment is tedious, and sort of hit and miss in 
nature. I missed many a times. Three times I actually lost 1st and 2nd 
gear all together. The last couple of times I had all gears back, but the 
2nd gear problem did not get any better. As I tried to fine-tune it again, 
I was all the sudden back off in the woods, with several gears missing. 
Needless to say I've given up for the night. :(
The questions then are:
 
	1. Is there some rather tangible procedure to start with, given 
that the spline clamp is completely loosened, and the whole thing is out 
of whack. How exactely do you start, where do you start from?

	2. Is this always so problematic? Do professionals have some sort 
of a knack for this, given years of experience? I assume that each time 
the engine/transmission is dropped this thing needs to be re-attached and 
re-adjusted.

	3. If all gears can be reached, but the 2nd gear engagement 
remains problematic (feels as if there is some type of obstruction) then 
what else could be wrong?


All help is greatly appreciated, as are letters of sympathy and 
condolences. Compared to this, the 30k tune-up is cake, as everything is 
measured, and much less of a guess!
