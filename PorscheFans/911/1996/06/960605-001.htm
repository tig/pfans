Bob Rouleau has an excellent response on the comparison between the two cars.
(Where else but a Porsche list can you get this sort of instant answer, from
somebody who REALLY knows firsthand, not from some magazine?)

>I too had read about the power on
>oversteer of the 4S and I think it is a crock. 

Who said that? One of the car magazines? Which one?
Yes, you can make ANYTHING oversteer if you unhook the rear end first by
braking too hard and pitching the wheel over, for example. I've looped a Golf
GTI that way. Dumb, but interesting lesson.

>The Turbo brakes are more powerful but I suspect that I can
go deeper into corners because of the better suspension (M030). There
is less dive and the car stabilizes more quickly so you can brake
later before turning in. 

I often find that braking tests are actually tire tests. Example: two
European sport sedans with ABS brakes, one with rock hard M+S tires, one with
sticky performance tires. WIth full ABS action, the one with sticky tires,
even though 200+ lbs. heavier, stops in 20 less feet from 60 mph. To compare
braking of the C2 and C4S, you should swap the wheels and tires to keep that
constant and then compare.
