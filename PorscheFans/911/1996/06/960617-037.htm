Robert.....
 (How do I write this without sounding like an *sshole)
 
Four K sounds like a pretty good down payment for a 911. If you have seen "driving examples"
in that range and didn't purchase it, you made a mistake. It costs about 1k more to do a major
overhaul on a 2 liter motor! 

 Then again a "driving example" to me might be a little diffrent than it is to you. I guess
you could get into a 2.7 with about 100k needing paint for that type of $$. Even then most
of them that I see bring about $5500. 



 Basicaly it seems to me that any 911 worthy of being on the road ands up costing a minimum 10k.
Pay later in time and frustration or now and enjoy.


(Bart got any green ones for Robert?)
(possibly some red ones for me??)
