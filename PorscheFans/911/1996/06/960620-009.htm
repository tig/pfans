Folks,

It's good to be back among fellow p-philes.  The weather's good, and the track
is open.  Now if only the car were done.... =8^)

I'm still working on my 914/6 conversion, which some of you may painfully
remember from the old pphiles days.  This weekend, I will be putting in some
SC struts that just arrived from RZ; those yellow UPS stickies are as good as
Xmas presents....=8^)

I'd like to go through the whole front of the car while I have it up.  The
19mm m/c is going in, and I plan to rebuild the pedal cluster with some new
bronze bushings.  I'm debating whether or not to put in some Weltmeister
bushings.  The old ones are now 24 years old, and I'm sure could use
refreshment, but I'm not sure of any real method to check them.  Will the
polyurethane ones be streetable, or should I really just leave them alone?
Avoiding burning the old rubber ones out in my apt complex has its pluses too.

I know the pros/cons of SS lines, and have decided that I still want to use
them.  There appear to be two types available now; the plain SS ones (burst
strength around 12kpsi), and some Kelvar sleeved ones (burst strength around
26kpsi), which also have the dubious benefit of DOT approval.  These I'm
planning on buying from Troutman or Vertex.  Opinions on which one to get
would be appreciated.

I'd like to add a front swaybar while I'm in there.  I currently have
aftermarket, under-car 19mm and 21mm front swaybars, as well as an aftermarket
rear swaybar (forgot the size).  I'm running the stock torsion bars, and
205/50's on 7" in front and 225/50's on 8" in rear.  Rear springs are 165 lb.
Troutman.  Which combination of swaybars would work well; I think most people
leave the rear off?  And would a through-the-body front bar like a Charlie bar
be work the $$$ for a mostly street car?  (The current bars are non-adjustable).
BTW, the struts have Boge shocks, and while they appear to damp, look like
they are leaking (the shafts are wet with an oily substance).  Do they need to
be replaced?  I've got some red Konis on the rear

Finally, I screwed up installing the new rear bearings on my Vellios rear
arms.  I froze the bearings and warmed up the arm with a propane torch,
thinking things would slide together easier.  Then I put some anit-seize on
the inside of the arm.  The bearing sorta dropped in, and I tried to seat it
with a brass punch.  Well, I think I got it crooked, because now the thing
is/was jammed (I think I killed it trying to remove/unjam it.  Oh well, what's
another new bearing.....).  Any suggestions on how I should proceed this
second time around?  I'm thinking of buying a large socket matching the outer
diameter of the bearing, and using that as a driver.  Will this work better
than the punch?

Oh, and for the person who wanted pic's of the arms (hope you're on this list
now....), I've got them; just need a way to get them to you.

TIA,
Mike
