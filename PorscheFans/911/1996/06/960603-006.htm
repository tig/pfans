<< 1) Which do you think would be a better autocross car, the C4S
or the C2 with sport suspension? The C2 is lighter and narrower, but
lacks the all wheel drive that seemed so friendly on the C4S and
did not plow AT ALL like all other AWD cars. I was able to drift
the C4S rear in tight corners and catch it easily (unlike my 911S
which will loop if I try to drift it much). Did the C2 feel even nimbler
and quicker than the C4S?

It would be too easy to say the C2 is better because you can steer with the
throttle. That's the purist answer. But the fact that Porsche put all-wheel
drive on the Turbo should tell us something. (A large part of the reason is
that putting all that power through only two wheels would limit the Turbo's
performance). So I don't know, I haven't driven the C4S yet, and without
driving both back to back and getting some slalom and skidpad times, I can't
say for sure, but it seems likely that the C4S will outperform the C2 in a
handling situation. Drawbacks are weight and width (Turbo rear flares and
wheels). So a tight twisty course might work to the C2's benefit. If straight
line speeds are so low that drag (fender flares, tires) doesn't become a
factor, they should be about equal.

The C4S basically is a package to give you awd and Turbo looks, but if you
don't need/want the awd and can live with a narrow body, you can get just
about all of the hardware, except for brakes, on a C2. I don't have prices
handy of the C4S vs. sport option on C2.

According to the 1996 Porsche Fact Book, you can get the Turbo f & r
anti-roll bars on the C2, they're std on the C4S. You can't get the Turbo
brakes on the C2, but most slalom courses don't give any Porsche brake system
a full workout anyway. (Race track stuff). You can get the 8 & 10 x 18 wheels
on both the C4S (std) or C2 (opt) but these are NOT the same wheels as on the
Turbo. Different manufacturing process (not friction welded together). Turbo
rear tires are still wider than anything available on C2 or C4S from factory,
at 285/30 ZR 18 (C4S: 265/35 ZR 18).

Porsche Fact Book actually quotes lower top speed for C4 than C2, 168 mph vs.
171, but quicker 0-60 mph (due to better traction off the line), 5.3 vs. 5.4
sec. Is slower in 1/4 mile though, 13.7 vs. 13.6 sec (due to weight? drag?).
And those numbers are for the narrow-body C4, not even the C4S, which will be
heavier and slower in both 0-60 and 1/4 mile.

>2) Do you think the '96 993 would be faster, slower, or about
the same as a Corvette and RX-7 Twin turbo (Super stock cars)? 
The same question vs the MR-2 Turbo and BMW M3 (A-stock).

I think it's a pretty safe bet it would beat stock MR2 Turbo or BMW M3.
Corvette and RX7, harder to say. Both are good cars. One would have to try
them under controlled conditions (a given slalom course, a race track, etc).
and see.

In any of these situations, it's possible that you could come up with a
course where Brand X beats Porsche. There are days when the 914s beat
everybody...
