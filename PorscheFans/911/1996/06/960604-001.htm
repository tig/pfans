We have one of each in our family.  A 95 993 and a 96 C4S. We track 
both cars. The C2 has a lowered suspension and 17 inch wheels 205 and 
255.  The C4S has 18 inchers with 225 and 285 rears. It has the M030 
sport chassis option.

The 4S rides more harshly than the 993 due to the 030 suspension. It 
feels better on the track though. 

The 993 has a nicer feeling brake pedal and a better gearbox feel. 
The 4S pedal is softer, more assisted and I'm told that this is a 
result of the ABD, and the different assist mechanism on Turbo brakes.

The shifter is better on the 993. AWD cars have a different linkage 
which is isn't bad but not quite as Miata like as the 993.

On the track:

The 4S has the varioram engine which helps offset the weight penalty 
versus the 95 993. All the 96's have the same engine so I'd expect 
the 993 to be a little quicker. I can feel it on the straights. 

At the end of the straight the Turbo brakes are more powerful 
although I find them harder to modulate because of the longer travel 
pedal and greater power assist. Still, I'm getting used to it and you 
can make up ground there.

On twisty chicanes or autocross courses, the AWD does help 
acceleration and more ground is made up there. Needless to say the 4S 
is the better choice on a wet or slippery track.

Top Speed:

The 4S is supposed to be slower but on any race track I've been on, 
I've never seen top speed anyway. Most I see at the end of a straight 
is about 145-150 MPH so the point is moot. Also, the fender flares 
are only part of the drag equation, the bigger tires also count.

18 inch wheels:

I can't find any R compound tires that fit. So it was off to Tire 
rack for a set of 17 inch wheels. For track use the 18 inch wheels 
are not much use right now. This will improve I'm sure.  Using street 
rubber on the track is possible but 18 inch tires (S02's or Pirelli's) 
cost a mint! I think Tire Rack sells the Bridgestones for about 1600 
for the set.

Handling:

After 4 track events and swapping cars with my better half, I can say 
that the new AWD system is benign. I had a 964 C4 and I can't say the 
same. I feel little to no difference between the two cars (C2 and 4S) 
under normal track conditions. I too had read about the power on 
oversteer of the 4S and I think it is a crock. To get it, the car has 
to be waaaay waaay out of shape to start with.  Trail braking to set 
up a slight oversteering attitude is easy on both cars. No major 
oversteer on either. The 993 chassis is a big improvement over 
earlier models in that respect. 

Note that the 993 is a very easy car to drive quickly. Be smooth and 
it is safe as houses. The 4S doesn't feel much different. Based on my 
experience with the C2 I didn't expect the 4S to be a miracle cure. 
That's because there are no serious problems to cure in the first 
place. I suspect Pete will agree.  Off the track, I had a different 
reason for wanting AWD.

The steering effort on the 4S is higher. Probably the extra 200 lbs 
and perhaps the AWD. Still you don't run out of lock the way the 
964's did.

Turn in is crisp on both cars. The extra weight makes itself felt but 
it isn't a bother. In part this is due to the M030 sport chassis on 
the 4S as opposed to the lowered but softer suspension on the 993. 

I'll have more to say about that another time as the 993 has been 
recently treated to a serious suspension tweak with dual springs, 
Bilsteins and some GT2 bars and bushings.   Based on the two cars as 
they were, my lap times are identical in both cars within reasonable 
limits. This is based on two different circuits, a long one (2:05's) 
and a shorter one 60 seconds. 

Why 4S:

Since two Porsches in the same garage is totally decadent, I bought 
the second one to use as a daily driver. I drove it in the snow and 
ice last winter on Toyo snow tires (all wheels). It goes very nicely 
in the snow and Porsches don't rust anymore.  The relatively small 
price difference between the C4 and the 4S made the latter look like 
a bargain.

If no snow:

Assuming I wanted something quick for the track, (DEW, SOLO I&II) I 
think that the C2 with the M030 sport chassis might be a little 
faster. The Turbo brakes are more powerful but I suspect that I can 
go deeper into corners because of the better suspension (M030). There 
is less dive and the car stabilizes more quickly so you can brake 
later before turning in.  My track experience with the 993 tells me 
that the "ordinary" brakes are damn good. Let's face it even on a DEW 
weekend, how much time do you get per run?  If run groups were two 
hours long, then the Turbo brakes would pay off. With the ususal 30 
minutes or so, the 993 brakes are just fine and a set of Pagid Orange 
pads with frequent fluid changes does the trick.

So for quick out of the box and no snow to deal with, I'd buy a C2 
order the sport chassis option, stick with 17 inch wheels and get me 
a set of R1's, Hoosiers or Toyo R compounds and turn fast laps.
