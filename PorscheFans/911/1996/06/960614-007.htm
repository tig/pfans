        It's T*d nostalgia time!  Hang onto your boots, folks!  [Note:
most of this is from my own Ted-isms collection...]

        Hmm, memory...  If I recall correctly, he was going to lunch with
another Pfile (name escapes me, sorry!) when this occurred.  He got a bump,
but the car had mercy and released the tie after one good whack.  He was
hoping that his girlfriend wouldn't learn about it, but the bump made it
unlikely.

        And don't forget the "Nazi sheep" crack.  Which led to the line about
us (the N.S.) being from Baaaden-Baaaden...  (ouch!)

        PCA Zone 7 Autocross in the Oakland Coliseum parking lot.
I get there about 11AM, since my group wasn't running or working
in the morning.  As I drive 'round the outside of the lot to get
to the grid area, I see a dog-doo brown 911 going around on the
course.  Accelerating hard, evidently--the nose is *way* up in
the air!  Then I notice that the driver is *braking*--when the
car accelerates, the nose goes up even higher!  I thought it was
going to flip!
        Sure enough, it was T*d.  We thought that his "competition
alignment" was pretty interesting.
        He was out there again the next day.  Heck, he was the
flagman for part of the day!  (Eeek!)  No pile-ups, though.  On
one particularly memorable run, T*d sets up way off line for the
second of a series of "gates".  Sure enough, he spins right at the
gate.  Gets the car around again, off he goes for the next gate,
SKREEEK!  Another spin.  Several of us on the sidelines are looking
on with smiles on our faces, probably remembering a time or two
that we did something like that...  And what the heck, it was just
a practice lap, right?  Then he comes around on his timed lap--
sets up in the exact same place for the gate, same result--around
he goes!  Gets the car moving again, and guess what?  Spins yet
again at the exact same place!  This elicited some laughter from
the crowd.
        On his next run, the announcer said, "Wing Commander T*d
Matsumura has already given us a demonstration of his loop-the-loop,
now he's going to try wing-walking!"  By that time, we were rolling
on the ground, howling with laughter.  Thus was born the Wing Com-
mander title.

        Not to mention a rooke in a stock 914 (me) also beat him by five
seconds.  I think this was before Scott was a serious TToD contender, but
I don't think Scott's *ever* been slow.  (Not compared to a stock 914!)

        That one was by Ken Rentiers (cowan@sccsi.com).  Just to keep the
attributions straight.

        And a sort of summary, from Paul Lyman:

        And a post-scriptum to Pete A's comments (from Pete in a later note):

        And finally, The Pfiles list's first sighting of Ted's Legal Problem:

        If I recall correctly, the suit was eventually dropped when T*d
agreed to dump the "porsche.org" domain name, which I think finally killed
off his 911 list.
