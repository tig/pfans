Pete Albrecht posted this interesting info :

>>The 993 is one of the best handling cars I've ever driven. And Porsche
didn't
pay me to say that. I test cars for Autoweek. At last count I've done
instrumented testing of 244 cars, and driven probably that many more for just
subjective impressions. The 993 is one of the few cars that I would actually
buy myself if I had the cash. Most of the other cars I would buy were made
about 25-35 years ago :-)  I think most new cars are so good, they're deadly
boring. The 993 isn't boring. <<

I agree! I autocrossed a '96 993 C4S Yesterday, it's so much better
and under braking, turning, and accelerating than my '72 S (that doesn't
leave much in favor of the older car). I realize you have tested all the
recent sports cars, and have experience in autocross competition, so
I would like to ask you a few questions :

1) Which do you think would be a better autocross car, the C4S
or the C2 with sport suspension? The C2 is lighter and narrower, but
lacks the all wheel drive that seemed so friendly on the C4S and
did not plow AT ALL like all other AWD cars. I was able to drift
the C4S rear in tight corners and catch it easily (unlike my 911S
which will loop if I try to drift it much). Did the C2 feel even nimbler
and quicker than the C4S?

2) Do you think the '96 993 would be faster, slower, or about
the same as a Corvette and RX-7 Twin turbo (Super stock cars)? 
The same question vs the MR-2 Turbo and BMW M3 (A-stock).

Thank you so much for your reply.

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S
