Well ... thanx to all replies, I now know what I am going to buy. But,
I did know some textbook stuff about torque, which might help here.

Like Mike mentioned, we really want to measure axial strain, or axial
load, if you will. But we cant really do that cheaply, so we try to
measure torque, which we can approximate modulo variance due to surface
grease.

But guess what, we cannot do that either! What we can only do is to
convert that torque (a force, or moment for the pedantic) again to a
displacement (or axial strain) of a wrench part -- and measure that
deformation in degrees of twisting of the ratchet handle. But guess
again, we cant do that too well either in the clickers -- we have to
convert that angular distortion to a linear movement, through a
cam-like part that goes click. Things get lost in the translation (no
pun intended).

Coming to the point, if you add an extension -- it will twist somewhat,
and just a wee bit is enough. So if the torque is the same, but the
twist of the wrench part of your wrench-extension combination is
smaller.  Hence it well measure a false torque.  So if you have to have
to use an extension, then at least should go a bit light on the torque
setting on the clicker. How much ? I dont know -- I am only a theory
guy :-)

You say that handle dont twist ? Yus sir, it does, it is that bending
that a beam type visually shows by exagerrating it using a long
pointer. If _that_ handle can bend, I can imagine that an extension
will twist like it was the seventies. Yes it will twist, Youngs Modulus
is after all a finite value in this dimension.

Of course, add on top of that worry about perpendicularity.

Foot-Poundals is like macro-economics theory.

Unka Bart, mother sends her love. BTW, I wasn't trolling :-) ... I was
merely off to Boston to ogle at some really cool P-cars -- or as I told
my advisor, to attend a conference in Brookline MA :-).  (Ooh! that
purple late model 911 Carrera type thing  with an hour-glass figure
that I saw exiting the pike into Cambridge on Monday morning!)

Got to run to Sears now ... Thanks to all, esp Barry, Fred, and Mike
for their very useful input.
