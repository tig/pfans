Hi Mike (et al),

The stainless steel brake lines I put on my Ducati 900SP are sealed iin a 
clear heatshrink tubing from fittin to fitting.  This also has the added 
benefit of preventing the line from "sawing" through adjacent 
component/structures.  It keep them pretty as well ;-)  Not a major 
concern on the 911, though,
