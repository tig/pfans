JJ:

Yes; if the mixture-adjustment were being performed as a means of
regulating cylinder temperature, one WOULD want to richen the
mixture to cool the engine down.  That's not what's happening,
though.

What's really happening is this:  When a cold engine is started,
much of the gasoline supplied by your injectors or carburetors
either remains in the liquid state or condenses from vapor back to
liquid when it contacts the cold cylinder walls and pistons.  Even
though the air/fuel mixture may be right, the air/EVAPORATED FUEL
mixture is probably much too lean to ignite.

Therefore, most cars have a means (cold-start injector, automatic or
manual choke, etc.) for ENRICHING the mixture on cold startup.  When
the manifold and cylinders warm up, there's no longer any need for
this extra enrichment, so the engine leans out.  Remember, though,
that since it's starting from a way-rich condition, this lean-out
only takes the mixture to the "normal" ratio.
