Hello-

I have a 1983 911SC which has  very, make that VERY bulky first and second
gears. I just got off the phone with the local dealer and they are telling
me I need a new clutch, and that is why my transmission is SOOO difficult to
get into first and second.

First of all does this make sense? The clutch does not slip, but it does
engage very high on the pedal sweep. He says that the clutch just does not
have much material left, and therefore does not fully disengage, not that it
drags or anything like that. The car has 87K on it FWIW, and I am quite
certain the previous owner was none to gentil with it.

Secondly, assuming that they are not blowing smoke, he tells me it will take
between 12 and 14 hours to replace the clutch?! Does this sound correct? He
claims that the motor needs to come out. I have been told that a clutch can
be done in five hours, true?

Any help would be much appreciated!!
