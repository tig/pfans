OK, I'll start.

My friend's 944 turbo is in the shop. He needs a clutch, and some other 
assorted stuff. His friend, who has an 86 911, was giving him sh*t
because the repair is going to cost $3000, and the car, which he
bought back in March, cost another $11,500. So, the 911 guy says
"Boy, between the 11.5 for the car, and the 3K for the repair, you
could have bought a nice 911." So my friend, very calmy and matter
of factly says, "Yeah, but then I'd be slow."
