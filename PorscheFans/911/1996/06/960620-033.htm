OK, I looked around a little bit, and Red Line MTL is different than the
stuff I'm using. There seems to be a difference between "transmission oil"
and "gear oil." The Red Line 75W90 is recommended for manual *transaxles*
which is what we have. MTL is for plain transmissions. The hypoid ring and
pinion gears usually require an EP-rated oil, while regualr transmissions
do not. Since we have a combined oiling system for both the differential
and transmission, the transmission has been designed for the differential
type gear oil. In fact, if you have a modern honda, for example, the
transmission takes 30 weight engine oil! My, have times changed. 

I probably wasted money on putting the synthetic oil in my transaxle,
since a piece of a thrust washer fell out when I went to replace the old
oil. Looks like I'm in for a rebuild sometime soon. Fortunately, I can do
this myself, since transmissions are my specialty here at the Patent
Office.
