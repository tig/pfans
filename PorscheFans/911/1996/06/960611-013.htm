Vic,

I have a 2.7 in  my 73.5 911 and have investigated all the different 
alternatives for oil coolers.  I have not installed one on my car yet but 
will install one in the front air dam when I do.  This location gets 
excellent air flow next to any fender mounted cooler and is where most 
racers have theirs installed.  If I am going to spend the bucks on a cooler 
I figure I might as well spend a few hundred more and do it right.  As far 
as prices go I have seen used coolers from $125 to $250.  But there is the 
oil lines running up front, various connectors and the thermostat.  The 
stock oil lines are pipes, where as Turbatrol uses stainless steel hose.  I 
know someone that bought used oil lines from a 911 that had the left side 
wiped out for around $400.  The only down side to having the air dam 
mounted cooler is that if you have a front end collision you will probably 
waste the oil cooler and of course it cost a bit more to install.

Let me know how it goes!

Scott
