  OFFICE MEMO          911 Spark Plugs (changing)             Date:6/17/96

I would like to install new spark plugs in my '83 911 SC and would like to get
the list's wisdom as to how best to do this (I dislike reinventing the wheel).


I've change plugs in all the cars I have own, but not a Porsche yet.  

I noted that the plug is a long way in the head, judging by the length of the
connectors (when I pulled them off).  

1. Are there special sockets that make the job easier (i.e., so you don't drop
the plug in the head taking it out or getting it started)?  (I have a standard
set of ratchet and sockets - with the standard spark plug sockets.  The ones
with the rubber inserts to protect the porcelain end of the plug, but they
don't hold the plug securely in the socket.)    
2. What is the best way to start a plug so its not cross-threaded?  I'm used
to starting a plug by hand, not in a socket at the end of an extention.
3. Should anti-seize be used on the threads (or some other application)?
4. Any other tricks, hints, or techniques that make the job easier?

TIA,
Elliot.
