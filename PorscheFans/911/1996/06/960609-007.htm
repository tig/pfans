Monte:

At the track, cars often find themselves rolling backward at high
speed after a spin.  This situation is somewhat less common on the
street.  In fact, it's SO uncommon on the street that some (many?
most? all?) street ABS systems were designed without taking into
account the possibility that the system might be engaged under those
circumstances.

A couple of years ago, there was a period of extreme doubt as to the
behavior of stock ABS systems activated while the car was traveling
backward.  I don't know what the eventual concensus was (my car
doesn't have ABS, so I didn't pay much attention), but if your ABS
system reacts badly under those circumstances, that WOULD be a good
reason to disable it.
