In the state of  PA when  an insurer pays a total loss to the insured
generaly  the insurrer  requries  the insured to turn the title in
and the insurer gets the title  marked as salvage. If the  vehcile  is then
found (regardless  of  condition) the  title  brand  is still there. it can  
be changed from a  salvage  title to a  R title  (reconstructed)  but the brand
is  (or  should  allways)  be there. There are ways  to wash the branding
clean  (unfortunatly). New  York state  comes to mind.  The state police  there
will inspect the car and issue  a New York title.  Word of  warning,
misrepresentation about  title  branding  is common and unexcepted  practice
of  a  professional, seems  private parties can act diffrently. It's an easy
thing to  get a CarFax on  the  VIN to find  out the history.  Especialy on
newer  cars.

(Mr.Bru.. can you help out on this one??)

It's legal to wash the title brand by doing it out of  state.  Don't  know  if
Florida will allways  keep the  brand or not. If you are  doing this  for resale
there is  a  question  of proper representation  (and  one of ethicality)
that  could find you in litigation  if the buyer ever finds  out  about
branding that was  not disclosed.


What happens now doesen't realy matter. 10 to 1, CarFax allready has  the title
brand marked in their database and if (when) I spend more than  20k on a  car
I  *allways*  run  one.
