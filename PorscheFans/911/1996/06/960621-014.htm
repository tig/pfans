> Hi Mr. Slowik,
> 
> I had a similar set of problems with my 71 911T that I did extensive work 
> on this winter.
> 
> The metalic sound turned out to be the cams needed to be timed.  I had 
> replaced the chain tensioners, and apparently that required the cams to 
> be timed,  the tools to do this cost about $200, I got a competent mech. 
> to do it for $250.  My backfireing at high speed was due to weak springs 
> in the destributor.  When staticly timed I had good idle and low speed 
> power, but backfired at speed.  Timeing the ignition using a good timing
light at 6000 RPM cured the backfireing but I had poor low speed power and
idle.  The problem was the springs in the distributor were weak so that when
it was staticly timed, it was twelve  degrees off at 3000 RPM.  
> 
> Hope this helps.
