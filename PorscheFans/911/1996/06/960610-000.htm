I totally removed every speck of sound deadening material and the paint
underneath it from my '68 912...only took a month. The best method I found
was to start with a sharp putty knife, that will get most of it off, then
follow up with some paint remover and a stiff wire brush on a drill motor.
Needless to say, let the paint remover dry completely before you attack it
with the wire brush.

One method I didn't try was a heat gun. I don't see why this wouldn't work
and I wish I had thought of it last November when I was out in the freezing
garage.

BTW, there was no rust on my floor pan.

Good luck,
Rich Lambert
