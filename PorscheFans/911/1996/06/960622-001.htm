          There have been a couple of questions lately about tachs and
          speedos bouncing around.  I'm pretty sure that both get
          their signals from the sensor in the transmission.  I've
          read that inconsistent odd behavior in these units is often
          the sensor.

          I haven't had that problem, but I do know that sometimes the
          clear plastic face of the tachometer can bow in and stop the
          tach needle from moving.  Mine does this when the car is
          parked in the sun on a hot day.  The tach either stays
          pegged at zero or maybe freezes part way up the scale.  I
          keep a small suction cup in the glovebox to pull out the
          face a bit and get the tach working again.  Sometimes you
          need to do this a few times before the needle stays unstuck.

          This seems to be a little-known problem that was driving me
          crazy until someone at a 1994 Parade tech session told me
          what was happening.  I thought I needed to send the tach
          out to get fixed.

          I think you can pry off the trim ring and reverse the
          face, but I haven't bothered.  I'm afraid I'll damage the
          ring.
