I know that my American P-fellows don't like very much original Porsche
products due to the North American overrated prices of those!
Anyway, Porsche sells a Paint Polish (999.901.018.40) and a Paint Protector
and Sealer (999.901.015.40). They are very effective, although I use them on
the original and perfect painting of my '89 Black Carrera.
The Protector is liquid and very easy to apply; be very careful removing all
of  it and with clean cotton rags.
The official Porsche bodyshop in Bologna (absolutely outstanding and author
of beautiful restoration of very important cars)  proposed me, some days
ago, a new Teflon treatment claimed to be a great improvement about shining
and endurance. Any of you has an experience about that?
Covers. I have the original Porsche dust cover; pretty expensive (300 US $
in Italy) but absolutely perfect, antistatic outside and antiscratch inside,
perfectly tailored and in beautiful pearl grey.
