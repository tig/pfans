It is not normal. They  should require no adjusting. When you installed the
930 tensioners did you put gaurds on them?

I  just did tensioners on a  Carrera. I wish I was working on my friends 73 or 
my old 66. Doing the job on a 73 is much easier. Get a set of exhaust gaskets
as its easier with the muffler removed. BTW.. if  ya wana do it the "get by"
method and not install carrera tensioners, buy  a set of tensioner  guards.
Put them on when you install your cover  gaskets.
