I have a 1983 911sc, and I have only just purchased the car a few months
ago. I too was wondering if the rev limiter REALLY exsisted. I had seen 6700
on the tach, and was reluctant to go higher. Eventually I did, just to make
sure it was working correctly, I decided to keep my foot in it till 7000 and
no more. 

Well at 7000 the motor stops, and I mean RIGHT NOW, it is no gentil thing I
tell ya, it comes in and lets you know in no uncertain term she aint goin'
no higher! I would NOT want to hit this in the middle of a corner, which is
EXACTLY why I think it is a good idea to find it under more "controlled"
cercumstances.

The manual says maximum revs is something like 6300 sustined, 6700 total.
The rev limiter is something like 6700 +/- 200 so when my tach shows 7000 I
figure it is just a tad optimistic.

Hope this helps a little
