Pete,

Thanks for your reply.

That's what I think too. Should be good competition.

That's for sure, in the Northeast on tiny lots the smallest, lightest
car often wins. But I don't think the 993 has any features that
could be used AGAINST it, as it's small and not too heavy.
Only the relatively-small engine (compared to the Corvette)
could be a disadvantage if low-end torque was needed for 
several slower turns leading onto straights. But that's what
first gear is for!!

Well, I think the best car of the 993s for autocross  will come down
to a C2 or C4 with optional sport chassis, as it will be narrower and 
lighter than a C4S. But the C4S's additional stability may be better
on some courses with few slaloms. I'm still not sure if the additional
weight of the C4 will be offset by the added stability and accelerative
traction of the all wheel drive. I think a C4 can steer with the throttle
nearly as good as a C2. I've learned that the lift-throttle oversteer
is still present on the C4S, but never tried power oversteer. 
Any 993 C2 or C4 or Turbo owners care to comment??

Also, does anyone know how they fit the optional 18" wheels
on the back of the non-flared C2 and C4? Are they different offset
from the C4S/Turbo rears? (I think the width is the same : 18 x 10).

Another question for 993 owners : I COULD NOT FIND the gears
in the C4S to save my life. Are they really bad or do you get used
to them? I missed my first 1-2 upshift, and a few 2-1 downshifts
(went to 3rd once). I guess I'm used to my terrible '72 linkage...

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S, '97 993 C2 RS ???
