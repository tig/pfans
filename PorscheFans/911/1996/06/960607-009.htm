Tom, thanks for the insight.  You analysis of the fuses looks right 
to me.  I borrowed the schematics from the dealer and gawd! they are 
a rats nest.  Both my 993 and 4S have ABD. From the way I see it, 
pulling the ABS fuse also kills the speed sensor for the ABD. That in 
turn is wired into the Motronic brain. I've been told (by the dealer) 
that pulling the fuse results in the car not starting. 

It looks like there should be a way to defeat the ABS on the C2 with 
"normal brakes". The 4S looks more complex because of the accumulator 
system and the way it works with the ABD.  I suspect as you do that a 
switch in the right location will do the trick. I haven't got the 
guts to rip open wiring harnesses to experiment on a brand new car 
<grin>.  Maybe we'll get lucky and some Bosch engineer will see our 
plight!

For Mike, the 4S in Canada does not have the M030 sport chassis as 
standard. I read in the early reviews that the 4S would have the 
Turbo suspension (still not the same as the M030 I am told) but 
actual reviews in C&D and R&T say otherwise.  Maybe US bound models  
are different but I doubt it.

Bob
