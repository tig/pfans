Thank you, thank you, thank you Pat!  Now I know why the outer hose I had didnt 
fit to the heat exchanger/sheet metal spigots.  I guess I'll have to break down 
and buy a parts manual for my '73S.  Anyone have one for sale?

So far I have been running my car with the inner hose connected to the 
thermostat but disconnected to the inside sheet metal.  Its just resting in 
there.  The car runs excellent with zero backfire or popping and the idle is 
solid at 1000rpms, so I think I'll leave it this way until I bring the car to my 
mechanic for a pump adjustment.

Steve
