Hey, I just fixed that same problem on a '68 911!  Bet I even have an extra
part you need to fix it (wink wink)...

What probably happened is the ball&socket joint under the pedal board popped
apart.  There are two (main) causes for this:

1) Your pedal stop broke (or in my case, non-existant) and you accidently
over extended the pedal, then the accelerator lever and popped the joint, or

2) The accelerator lever broke and allowed you to drop the pedal to the floor.

I suffered from all of the above.

If your lucky, the socket just popped apart.  just feel around behind the
gas pedal for the lever, pull it forward and snap the socket (of the push
rod) back on to the ball of the lever...

If you aren't so lucky...

Carefully pull back the carpet and remove the pedal board.  Then peer to the
back right of gas pedal.  There is a lever that rocks in and out of the
center tunnel of the car.  There is a large ball on the pedal cluster side
and a slightly smaller ball joint on the right (connects the throttle
linkage inside the tunnel).

Before ~'73/4 the lever consisted of a small plate with the ball joints and
a thick rod that was welded to the plate at a right angle.  Since I didn't
have a pedal stop, the joint was constantly stressed, water got in over the
course of 30 years, rusted and finally broke.  After '74, the part was
forged and a number of parts places told me that the welded part was the
stronger one.  If the joint is not at 90 degrees, and the weld is still
good, try to carefully bend the joint back in to shape.  If the weld is
broken, you'll need a new (old) part, or maybe have a machine shop clean the
joint and reweld it.

The thick rod slides through a small tunnel behind the brake pedal linkage
(right side of the cluster, in the very back) and is held in place by a
small cotter pin.

I'm almost 100% certain that it is the SAME lever as seen on the linkage on
the carburetor end of the system.  It's the pie-piece shaped lever bolted on
to the carb right where the linkage comes out of the fire-wall.  If you
happen to have a Stoddard's part catalog handy it is item 35 on the diagram
- can't remember the part number...

Drop a line if you need any more details.  Good luck!
