I've never tried Slick 50, but I've been told that the teflon pellet size 
is too large to do any good. It has to be smaller, which is more 
expensive to produce, to be any good at reducing friction.

A better alternative oil treatment, that we have here locally, is called 
MiliTec 1. Actually, it's a metal treatment, since it bonds with metallic 
surfaces to increase slipperiness, according to the manufacturer. It's a 
milspec product, I believe, or it's at least used by the military, if 
that means anything. But really, just using synthetic oil is the best way 
to go. It was devloped originally for jet engines because they were 
having problems with petroleum-based oils, so I've been told. Also, 
syunthetic has a much better thermal conductivity than regualr oil, which 
is really importatnt in our "oil cooled" engines. Synthetic doesn't break 
down at the higher operating temperatures of our engines, either.
