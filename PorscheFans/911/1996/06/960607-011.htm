Here's the info Jim Bergman sends out when somebody gets auto-dropped for
some reason.

============================================
This is the explanation that goes with the copy of the message that comes to
Jim when a person is kicked off the list:

* * *    W A R N I N G !    * * *

Your subscription to PorscheFans was revoked because your mail server could
not be found, your mail account on your server was shut off, or was so busy
that it could not accept any new mail.  The attempt to deliver your
PorscheFans mail is made a number of times over several hours before it is
tagged as 'undelivereable'.

While it is inconvenient that your PorscheFans mail was returned, it
indicates there is a problem with your mail server or your mail account.  If
the PorscheFans message got bounced back, you can be SURE that other messages
meant for you are getting bounced back too.  You should contact you mail
system administrator and inform him of the problem.  He'll probably want to
see a copy of this message, so go ahead and forward it to him.

If your mail administrator says 'Not me!  No problem here!', we recommend
that you subscribe to the PorscheFans list in digest mode, which sends you
one message a day containing the entire contents of the day's traffic.  This
reduces the load on your server (and ours), which can only help to speed
things up.  Send a message to "PorscheFans@ioio.com" and you will receive an
automated help message detailing how to subscribe in digest mode.  The
contents of any message to PorscheFans@ioio.com are ignored, since it is an
auto-responder.  Your last resort should be to send a message to
"listmaster@ioio.com".




==================================
