Hi, Porschenauts,

   I am back!!  I have been lurking for a few days since getting online to 
the new mailing list.  Let me pass along a tip for Targa owners as a 
re-entry message.

  If you have an older Targa, your headliner probably droops.  Although redoing
the whole top with new vinyl would probably be better, fixing just the 
headliner was fairly straightforward:

-Remove the screws holding the hook-shaped clamps.
-Pull the headliner out.  This means gently breaking what's left of the glue 
 and original padding material (a piece of thin foam rubber).
-Undoubtedly, the original foam has disintegrated into crumbling mush. Remove
 the big pieces by hand.  Lay the liner on a flat surface near a trash can.
 Use a stiff brush or whisk broom to sweep away foam bits.  Do the same for
 the inside of the Targa top.
-For new backing material, I went to the fabric/crafts section of WalMart and
 bought polyster batting material in sheet form.  They had different kinds; I 
 found one that was ~0.2" thick and was pretty strong against pulling apart.
-I cut the batting sheet into a rectangle (27" x 41") and cut out small 
 rectangles (3"x6") for the corners.  
-I decided to glue the headliner to the batting sheet first, and then put
 the whole deal onto the top.  Use, of course, 3M General Trim adhesive. 
 You will need 2 of the small cans.
-After attaching the headliner to the batting sheet, glue the center section 
 of the assembly to the center of the Targa top while the folding arms are
 straight out.
-Next, put more adhesive on the outer sections, and fold the folding arms 
 half way. Push the remaining flap of the headliner under the half-opened
 arms. 
-Screw the hook-clamps through the edge of the headliner using the original
 holes.  This can be quite difficult.  I used much longer screws to get all
 the bits aligned, then replaced them with the original, shorter screws.
 The plates that the screws go into can "float" so be careful.
-Adust the position of the hook/clamps so that they engage the folding
 arms fully when the top is fully open.

 That's all there is! HTH.
