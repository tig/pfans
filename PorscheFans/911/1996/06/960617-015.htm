Since the plugs are down deep, it does take some extra work to remove the
plugs.  You can change the plugs with a normal spark plug socket (the type
with the foam insert.  Before you start, you should glue the foam to the
socket, to ensure that it does not get stuck on the plug in the hole.
I have purchased a socket that has a magnet, and this makes it easier.  Also
you will need two short (3") ratchet extensions.  Use the plug socket and
one extension to place the socket on the plug, then attach the next 3"
extension and use your wrench to loosen the plug, then use your hand to turn
the plug to remove it.  By using your hand you can feel to be sure that the
plug is not cross threaded.  If it is, then rotate the plug in the direction
of installing, and then back it back out.  This will help get the plug in
the correct orientation to remove itself, to try to fix the cross thread.

Practice on your normal car, the one that you can see the plugs, and use the
socket and plug.  On the 911 it is not too bad, if you use the socket and
one 3" extension, you can feel the plug getting started on the threads,
again, use your hand to turn the plug all the way in until it stops, then
use the wrench to do the last bit of tightening.  The plugs just have to be
tighten a firm amount, don't crank on them too much or you will damage the
threads in the head.  Check the manual, I think the torque setting is low,
like 15 or 20lbs.  This is not much torque, considering most torque wrenches
start at 30lbs or so.
 
>3. Should anti-seize be used on the threads (or some other application)?
 
You should use anti-seize on the threads, not too much.  Look at them when
you remove them.  You should see the anti-seize in the groves of the
threads.
You should also put anti-seize on your alloy wheel nuts.
 
>4. Any other tricks, hints, or techniques that make the job easier?
 
I does take longer than it should.
