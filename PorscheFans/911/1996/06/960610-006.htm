No. You'd be amazed at what can hide under innocent looking tarpaper. I did a
friend's 356. Engine compartment looked pretty good. Then we tore the
tarpaper out and found that it had been trapping moisture and turning the
sides of th engine compartment into swiss cheese.

The stuff is held in place by a layer of melted tar on the back of the paper,
which is stuck to the painted sheetmetal. It's going to be a mess no matter
what. Freezing is theoretically a good idea, the stuff gets brittle then and
a broad-bladed putty knife or chisel might get bigger pieces off. Even if it
isn't really cold, sometimes a sharp blow will cause the asphalt backing to
shatter, while a gentler blow would only scrape. Tar does funny stuff
depending on the rate of strain. Bends under steady load, shatters under
impact. When chipping tar, wear safety goggles, the stuff tends to form
shrapnel. Don't try this on a hot day, the tar won't be brittle enough. If
it's summery hot where you are, try working in the morning or evening. It
seems brittle enough when it's 60s and 70s outside. I had no problem removing
the stuff from a 356, all of it inside the cabin and engine compartment and
trunk, using a mallet and putty knife. It came out in solid pieces for the
most part; just work the putty knife around to peel it up. 

Also, once you get most of it out, the remaining tar dissolves in ordinary
paint thinner (turpentine, NOT lacquer thinner!) Turpentine/mineral spirts
won't attack the car's paint but will soften the tar so you can wipe the rest
out with lots of paper towels. Do this outside, away from flames.

If you want to restore it right, after getting it out, you have to put stuff
like it back in. I don't know if Porsche sells that stuff anymore. I imagine
they do, it hasn't changed in ages and many if not all new cars all over the
world still use this same principle to reduce noise. Bill Perrone at The
Parts Shop in Huntington Beach makes the stuff for 356 applications but that
won't help you. He will sell parts for pre-74 911s though, so maybe you could
ask there. 714-894-3112.
