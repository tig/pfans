Hello Porsche Volks,
	My 911 AND 944 are finally on the road!  The 944 was oddly fixed 
by just disconnecting and re-connecting the fuel pump electricals Sunday, 
and I finished the 911 brake overhaul today.  Took off the day from work 
just to finish up and enjoy my 911 :^)
	The brakes work incredibly well now, it has vented front rotors 
and solid rears, and the rear brakes don't need any work evidently.  I 
finally got to take it up to speed!  Whoever came up with the phrase 
"whirling banshee" to describe the early 911 engine sound was a master of 
literary description!  Unlike the '72 911E I drove, this one has a bunch 
of pull down low in the RPMs, but gives up high RPM zoom.  Mine really is 
very smooth sounding compared to others I've driven, but is a bit noisier 
than those due to an old Bursch muffler.     
	I tried washing and buffing the white paint, which is badly 
deteriorated, and it looks OK for the time being but is very chalky and 
the original orange shows through in the rock chips :^)  Can't wait until 
the down-to-the metal Blutorange paint job my brother has promised for my 
birthday!  Also the new floorpans and front pans he will install to pay 
me back for the $500 he still owes me from buying that '76 914 2.0.  Ah, 
brotherly love!  
	Speaking of which, does anyone have any new floorpans or front 
pans for sale for a '69 911T?  Know who has good prices on them?  How 
about some good barely used shocks/strut inserts?  Can't wait to get this 
thing in decent shape...thanks for any suggestions!

Jay Karolyi
'69 911T temp tags now...someday to have "BLOOD O." or "DIAL 911" (which?)
'88 944 tagged "NOSBST2T"  (know where I could find a "My other car is a 
      Porsche" sticker?  :^)
