          Dirk, I can think of a couple of reasons to change to the
          adjustable spring plates.  The first is that getting the
          rubber bushing off your old ones is a real pain.  They
          are bonded to the spring plate and are not intended to
          be replaced.  I've seen people suggest burning them off
          (must be messy) or carving them off and then using a wire
          wheel on a bench grinder to polish off the remaining bits.

          Also, I think it was in 1978 that Porsche added some ride
          height adjustment to the stock spring plates.  Not as
          variable as the Sway-Aways, but still enough to make corner
          balancing easier.

          You might find that the added labor necessary to corner
          balance your car without any ride height adjustment to the
          spring plates will go a long way to paying for the
          Sway-Aways, especially used ones.  That's because I think
          your shop will have to re-index your torsion bars each time
          they need to adjust the rear ride height. (Maybe someone
          who's been through this can confirm.)

          Hope this helps!
