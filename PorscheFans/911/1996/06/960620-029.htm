Hi,

After the big crash at TTA, it is nice to have found you guys again. Well, I have a question 
concerning motor mounts. The rubber in my rear motor mounts are completely dried out and
are starting to come apart. I was told that I need new mounts so I would like to do
this myself. Unfortunately, I no longer have a floor jack to support the engine, so I was
wondering: Is it was possible to replace one mount at a time without using a jack? If not, can I
wedge several bricks under the engine so that it doesn't drop too much i.e. less than an inch and
then pop the sucker in?

And lastly are there any tricks to doing this. It seems fairly simple to do. Oh sorry, one more
question. Any difference between the club sport mounts advertised by Vasel Polak and regular
mounts?

AS for the clutch job, Fred Hess calculated out the time this way:
  3 out
  3 in
  1 separation
  1 machine work on flywheel
  1 reassembly
  3 miscl replacement of gaskets, seals, general tlc, test drive, oil change,
  valve adjustment.
  See how it add up?

Unfortunately he forgot several things. The 15 hours most likely only refers to the clutch 
replacement only. The 3 extra hours for misc will be added to the side and the flywheel work 
would probably also be extra. 

I had to get a starter ring replaced in my 911 and whenever something needed replacing,
they always quoted the book rates, e.g. I needed a new "s" oil hose and he wanted to charge me 
1/2 hour labor to replace it even though the engine was out of the car and one side was already 
disconnected. I mentioned that and he said that he would do it for free. Then I asked about a valve
adjustment and he said that they charge 3 hours of labor even if the engine is out of the car. 
It seems to me that if the engine is out of the car and all the valves adjustment screws are in 
plain sight and unobstructed, that a valve adjustment could be done in less than an hour. oh well, 
I guess labor book rates are kind of like lawyers mysterious ability to have 25 hours of billable 
work in a day. Enough ranting and I hope that I haven't offended anyone.


Well hanks a lot for any help that you can give me with my motor mounts,

Neil Kumpers
