I haven't been on the list for very long, but in the short time I've been
recieving it, I've seen this topic come up a couple of times.  I haven't
seen much response however, so perhaps info is mailed directly or you 
just can't stand it any more 8^)

I appologize if I'm beating a dead horse...

In the past few months I started thinking about purchasing a 911.  Last October
I went to a dealer and drove a 1987 coupe with 70000 hard miles on it.  It 
had some rust bubbles around the window gaskets and seemed to have generally
led a life of abuse.  Despite its cosmetic condition, driving the car was,
as people on this list know, exhilarating and fun.  Nothing like the 7 series
BMW I drive now (and have taken to driving schools!).

So, my question is, are the technical changes in the 964 models vs. the 911 3.2
worth the extra money I'll spend?  I've read the book "Original 911" but without
experiencing the cars, as people in here have, its hard to make a judgement
about things like the coilover suspension, reduced engine noise, etc...

Obviously a brand new 993 would be prefered, but that's a lot more money than I
want to spend at this point.  Looking at production numbers (and therefore
availability of used cars) I'm probably looking at the years 1987 through 1991.
Basically $35K and under.

Also, what about C4 vs C2?  I've heard that the 964 C4 cars were prone to
expensive repairs to the AWD system.  Is this true?

Thanks for any info,
