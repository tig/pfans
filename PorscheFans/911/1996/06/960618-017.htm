Well, one of the two hoses going to my front-mounted oil cooler decided
that it no longer wanted to remain attached, and promptly disconnected
itself at 70 mph on the highway today.  Needless to say, the entire
experience was frightening, messy, and smoky.  The first indication that
the oil was leaking was when black smoke began to enter the passenger
compartment of my '76 914.  At that point I pulled over (VERY fast, and
when I came to a stop, the oil light came on.  I turned the engine off
immediately.  I assumed that I had an engine fire for sure... but there
was no flames, and after the car had sat for about 10 seconds, there was
no more smoke, either.  I looked under the car, and sure enough, there's
that hose just hanging there up front, and the entire underside of the
car is coated in oil.  I was able to look back on the highway, and see
the streak of oil leading to my parked car.  The streak was only about
400 ft long, and since the engine was shut off as soon as I stopped, I
don't think I did any damage to the engine at all.  In fact, there was
still oil draining out of the oil cooler long after I stopped.  The hose
clamp was still on the hose, so I tightened all of my oil hoses up real
tight, but obviously, I have no oil in the car.  My question is: Can I
just add the 5 quarts and be on my way?  I figure there will probably be
some smoke from the residual oil left on the headers (which are the
reason that the oil smoke entered the passenger compartment -- no heater
hoses...), but other than that I can't think of a reason that I should
have it towed home...

Thanks!
