Scott,

I've had great results on my **red** '87 '930 and black 535i w/ original paint
using Autoglym products. They make a 3-step (cleaner, polish, and resin sealer)
process that removes minimal paint (only the oxidized paint, if you know when
to stop!) and seals the surface. If you maintain the surface quality of the
finish then you shouldn't have to repolish very often. The polishes are
available in a variety of compounds to suit the condition of your paint, the
idea is to use the lowest abrasive content possible.

My 930 is primarily used at PCA events and concours and I always get
complements on the condition of the paint. The paint was slightly faded when I
bought the car and several repaeat applications of the process brought the
paint back up to concours condition. I reseal the paint every 3-4 months but
havent't had to repolish it, and no paint comes off during the cleaning/reseal
process (i.e. clean rags!).

If you can't find this stuff, call the Car-Nuba Store in Costa Mesa, CA,
714-548-8430, ask for Marco. Autoglym also makes a killer line of plastic/vinyl
cleaners, great for Porsche dashes and the hard rubber/plasic exterior bumper
guards and '74-'89 911 front bumper "smile" inserts. I love this stuff - easy
to use and excellent results. But not cheap!

Best regards,

Barry Mattingly
