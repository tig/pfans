Wade:

All the 2.4 litre models (72 &73) had matt black air intake grilles (plastic
on the 73's as well as the front and rear light surrounds) and matt black
rear Porsche script.   As long as the chrome windows surrounds were still
"standard" (thru 77), you could still order chrome front grilles and
lettering as an extra cost option (just like rosewood, composites, etc today
for interior trim)...some may have preferred full "chrome" for appearance.
 Why don't you acquire the original build sheet from Porsche and see what was
listed?
