Bart Chambers asked that I respond to the above questions:

I used to be a instructor for the Skip Barber boys and for the Russel 
Boys and I can tell you that both would be a excellent choice.  Be Aware 
at the 3 day Race schools at both Skippy and Russel you are always givin 
a rev limit and only if you prove to the instructors that you are fully 
capable of handling the race car will you be givin the full rev range of 
the engine in the LAST session of the last day. By being givin a 
artifically low rev limit it helps to teach both awareness and control. 
Even though that may look like a detriment it's not... You will be taxed 
to the limit by the instructors and will both learn an incredible amount 
and have a ton of fun.  They will not however find you a ride. They will 
entice you to enter their own series, which for the Barber Dodge series 
is like $10,000+ per race entry fee... More if you tend to bounce off of 
solid objects.  If you do well enough to win enough races to be the 
series champ you will recive a "Carrer Enhancment award" of $100,000 (You 
get your entry fees back) and you will then have on your drivers resume a 
series championship.

Good luck and let me know which school that you choose.

If you have anymore Questions let me know.
