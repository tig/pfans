        From what I hear, back in mid-May both tta.com *and* Stan's work
system went down pretty hard.  Obviously the work machine had first pri-
ority.
        Unknown why tta is still down, but the rumor mill has it that two
things will be accomplished before it's back up and connected to the 'net:
1) Majordomo will be installed to handle add/drop/etc., and 2) the whole
works will come up under the "porschephiles.org" domain name.  The delays
could stem from the latter, as PCNA and Porsche AG are notoriously thorough
about keeping people from using the Porsche name in business names, etc.
And, since the whole "porsche.org" thing, they're quite aware of the 'net.
Anyway, that's my guess--they're waiting to find some bilingual lawyers...
