Seeing as I was one of the folk offering advice, I guess other than my 
previous comments, I would start with making sure the transmission is in 
1st gear (all the way, take the coupler off of the splined shaft, make sure 
that the shifter is in aligned into the 1st gear gate and then slide it on 
to the spline until it is "nicely" into the 1st gear location. Second check 
is to make sure that neutral is indeed allowing motion across the gear 
selection without catching any gears. If it doesn't then again move it a 
bit.

I am concerned that you have another problem, as I have done this about 5 
times in the last year, and while it can be a bit tedious, an hour is lots 
of time to get it spot on....
