Dear P-Fans,

While driving to work today I noticed that my brake lights were not
lighting up with normal pedal pressure (I noticed this by the reflection of
my brake lights off the car in back of me).  The lights would come on only
when very high pressure is applied.  Looking in the Haines manual, they
show the stoplight switch behind the brake pedal and adjustment procedure.
As I have an '88 I also looked in the back of the manual for the "later"
cars.  This section shows two stop lamp switches on the master cylinder.
My questions are:

1.  Does an '88 still use the stoplight switch behind the brake pedal?

2.  If not, would the likely cause be one or both stop lamp switches on the
master cylinder?

3.  If it is one of the switches on the master cylinder, is this best left
to a professional?


My guess is that the car still uses the switch behind the pedal, and that
switch has gone out of adjustment.  What do the experts think?

Thanks in advance!

Ron Bolsky
