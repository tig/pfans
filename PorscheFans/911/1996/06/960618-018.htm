Just fill it up and start it up...it should be not different than an oil
change. 

You may want to fill the tank, and then crank the engine over without any 
ignition just to get the oil pressure built up before the engine fires.

Get ready for lots of smoke from the oil burning off the headers...should be
lost of fun and **stink**.

I know this...I had my mechanic do a valve adjust on my 83SC, and he did not snug
up one of the oil lines. Oil all over the engine compartment, and by the time
I detected it (oil pressure was a little low, but it looked okay), i lost about
8 litres total....however, that was 5000 miles ago, and no apparent damage. I was
worried like you, but as long as you maintained reasonable oil pressure, and the
car did not overheat, you should be fine. Anyways, we put in 8 litres right there on 
the side of the highway...plenty embarassing for the mechanic, and it left quite the 
oil slick.

So, just put the oil in, start it, and check for leaks.
