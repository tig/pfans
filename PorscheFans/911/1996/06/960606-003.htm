Glasurit for one. I know the Glasurit color book at the local paint dealer
goes back to the early 60s. Probably other manufacturers cover Porsche too.
Glasurit ("Glasso" to many paint shops) is a premium German paint used as
original equipment by Porsche and others. It's expensive and it's nasty stuff
to inhale so it's best left to pros with proper booths and breathing gear.

Another outstanding import brand is Sikkens. Those two are probably seen on
more concours cars than all the other brands put together.
