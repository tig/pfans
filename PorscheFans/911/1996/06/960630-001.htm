Thanks for the help.  I Took most of the lower panels off and found 
the horns 
stuck up under the passenger side wheel well.  Only 6-8  screws to 
take out the panel
and easy to get to.  Low and behold I have a bad low note horn, and 
there is no way to
fix it that I know of.  I found a pair of real loud Hella horns in a 
Griot's Garage catelog (118db),                                       
                  which ought to do the job nicely.  They're not 
stock equip. of course, but my thinking is it is probably 
better to be heard when you need to be heard than rely on the stock 
whimpy sound
from the OEM horns.  If anyone wants to know how I like them after I 
install them let me know.
Thanks again,  Rob.
