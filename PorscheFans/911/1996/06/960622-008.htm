Greetings P-nuts (fourteeners)
on 6/19/96, Kyle Ehler wrote this post, repeated below...
I am repeating it here, because I seem to have this exact same problem now
(again...%^&@#*!) and yes, it's been real hot in my garage and the '14s
been just sitting in this garage heat (direct sun is probably a little
cooler in this case-I dunno) ...regardless,the car has been sitting for at
least two weeks since it ran last.
anyway...the deal is:  I turn key, nothing...no juice nowhere. The last
time I went through this, I thought I solved the problem by farting around
with the fuses resident on the relay board (in engine compartment)

My question to everyone here is:
with respect to Kyle's line of thought, can't I simply change the starter
(ignition) switch? the one that lives behind the key tumbler?
I agree with kyle that using one of those "booster kits" only hides the
real problem...(sorta like sticking the little screw in your throttle
butterfly to lower the idle - not smart)

Do I understand Kyle correctly here? or is he talking about cleaning
something else?

Any thoughts?  I'm all ears...(and thanks loads in advance!)

cheers
Thom Kuby
