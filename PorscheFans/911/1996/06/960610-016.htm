My $0.02.  I like the click handle wrenches, and I like the 
digital readout wrenches, but I use a beam handle wrench.  Why?
They're cheap, they tend to be quite accurate, and they hold
their calibrations.

On the other hand, they can be inconvenient.  It seems that
more than 50% of the time the scale is facing the wrong way
so you have to be a contortionist to read it.  I think if
I were in the 'biz', where time is money, I'd go for the
clicks and the digitals.  But I'm in the 'hpbby biz' which
is just the opposite.  Hobbies are supposed to suck up time.
So I use a Sears beam pointer.

Bet this really helps you.

One more thing.  I hardly ever use it.  Pretty much just
for head nuts.  I don't think any of the other stuff is
really that critical.  Maybe a few exceptions.  Clutch bolts.
The long bolts and nuts through the 911 case.  Hey.  Guess
I use it more than I think!
