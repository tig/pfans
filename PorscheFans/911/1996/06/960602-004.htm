To Clarify (hopefully),

Yes, there was a 68S, but it was for European consumption only. However,
there are now a fair number of these cars in the US that have come in over
the years. They are desirable, to my way of thinking, because they
incorporate all of the good things a '67S had (Vented brakes, 160hp engine
w/IDS Weber carbs, etc) and add a few more like; dual circuit brakes, and the
use of aluminum (rather than chromed brass) trim and plastic (the steering
column surrounds) which lighten the car. Also, they don't suffer from the
dreaded 'smog-pump' of other '68s because they are Euro cars. Anyway, I like
them because they seem to have benefited from the 911R exercise the factory
went through.

My $.02,

'67S Coupe, '68 S Targa (very rough project car)
