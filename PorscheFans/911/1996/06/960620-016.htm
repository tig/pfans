Maybe. It sounded to me like he was accusing the guy of stealing.
(Kevin, sorry if you weren't, but that's the way it came off sounding).

I also have some experience in this sort of thing. In a previous life,
I used to write real time S/W for microcontrollers that got burned 
into prom.

Our software was never copy protected. If someone wanted a copy of
a PROM, hell they could call me and I'd send them one. The PROM was
useless without the box to stick it in. Then again, that was a 
different market, and I couldn't imagine anyone making copies.

Well, I HAVE taken a system apart. It was from my 86 944. I bought
an aftermarket chip and I wanted to make sure it was programmed
differently than the stock one. I didn't want to get into "The
Empirer's New Clothes" situation. So I loaded the new and old PROMS
into the PROM programmer and compared them. Sure enough, they were
different. And I think that MAYBE I could tell a slight difference
in performance, but not too much.

Anyway, I made copies of both chips. I was surprised at how small
the chips were (16K). I couldn't find any 16K PROMS, but I did find
a 32K unit that looked the same from 0-16K, so I used that. It
worked perfectly. When I sold the car I gave the new owner the original
chip. I think I still have the copies somewhere.

The new OBD systems are very complicated, and definately have something
like this built in. It gets worse. The OBD systems are SO complicated,
and SO comprehensive that it might mean the end of the High Perf
Chip. Then again, the aftermarket can be very clever when it has to.
