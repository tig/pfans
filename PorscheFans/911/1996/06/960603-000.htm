I suspect (hope??) that you have an adjustment problem on the linkage, mainly as 
the alternative is such a pain.

Adjusting the linkage is tedious, but not difficult, I would tie it into installing that 
short shift kit (did you get the excellent factory one or....one of the others...no bias 
intended). You also might consider replacing the bushings in the rear shift coupler 
with the Weltmiester kit and the other two bushings (one on the shift rod, the other 
the cup on the bottom of the shifter itself)

The way I have adjusted the linkage is to take off the cover just in front of the back 
seats, the one on the floor on the tunnel. This will expose the shft coupler (got to 
pull the rubber boot back). Then shift the transmission into 1st. 
Loosen the bolt on the top of the shift rod which pinches the splined shaft on the 
coupler  until you can move the two relative to one another. Given that you can 
visualise the movements/rotations which shift the thing, you should be able to align 
the rod/coupler until it shifts properly. My suspicion is that you need to slide the 
coupler forward about 2 mm or so, as probably the shift linkage is not moving all 
the way into 2nd.

The factory scheme for setting up the linkage is to separate the coupler and the 
shift rod, get the transmission into neutral, rotate the shifter so that you are in the 
1/2 plane and then putting it back on the spline, sliding it until you are at neutral on 
the shifter. It works, but I find that if you are only a little off, you run a greater 
chance of making it worse rather than better.

Good luck
