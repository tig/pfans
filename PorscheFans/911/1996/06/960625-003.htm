Hi, PorscheFans.

I'm baaack...

I tried logging on from Germany but the diesel phone net won't talk to my
digital notebook. France works OK though. Following is the post I wanted to
send but couldn't. 

Thanks to the folks who posted Le Mans updates in my absence. Next year, we
might be able to do this in some sort of official capacity. The workstations
in the LM press room have phone jacks and I know my laptop works in France. 

Anybody have any luck with the LM web site? I tried it right there in the
press office and it wasn't working right.



Le Mans report
Sorry to have been incommunicado (is that in Italy?) for over a week.
Haven't gotten P'fans in all that time and am going through withdrawal.
Seems unsubscribed 'Fans from my AOL account just fine but did'nt do the CIS
subscribe correctly. So all I had in my mailbox was junk mail (how did this
trend get started? Can we e-mail bomb these turkeys?) and two private posts
from 'Fans. One was Eric Gustafson from San Diego Region, whom I bumped into
at the PCA/Germany Region campground before I got his message sent from USA.
The other was Jim Moder of Germany Region who couldn't make it, but I did
hook up with him by phone later.

Met lots of people there. Leonard & Betty Jo Turner of Panorama, Judy Boles,
pres. of PCA, Bruce and Stephanie Anderson, Paul Frere, Joe Rusz of Road &
Track. 
The fellow who used to be chief designer of the out-of-house engine projects
on which I worked at Porsche,
Herbert Ampferer, is now racing director. Norbert Singer was there working
with the team, Valentin Schaeffer is retired but went to keep an eye on
things. Peter Falk and Helmut Flegl weren't there and I think are no longer
with the company. We were able to chow down for three squares a day in the
Porsche hospitality tent with the likes of Hans Stuck and Karl Wendlinger.

Oh, yeah, da Race. In case you've been asleep, Porsche won. First three
places. The Joest WSC car beat the two factory GT1 cars by only 37 seconds.
Its best lap was exactly one sec better than the second place GT1 car. In
the hourly standings, the winning #7 was always listed as leader. The only
time it wasn't actually leading was when pit stops overlapped and another
car temporarily pulled into the lead until it too had to pit.

The Le Mans people are really organized. The press room is
huge, probably room for 200-300 scribes and TV and all. Each work station
has a monitor on which you can call up live TV feeds from several cameras,
broadcast TV (some guys were watching the Canadian GP instead), and a split
screen display of current standings/car numbers and times as they trigger the
automatic timing and scoring sensors at the start finish line for each lap.

We got to the track in a rented motor home. Cost us about $320 for rental
not incl fuel, with 2000 free km, more than enough to get there and back
from Germany. It's nice to have a place to crash and shower and eat. We
camped out in the PCA/Germany Region compound, shared with PCGreat Britain.
Part of the camping fee goes to U.S. commissary burgers and dogs and a big
keg of Foster's. Driving time from Karlsruhe is about 8 hrs. The Fiat Ducato
platform under this motor home takes my prize for worst ergonomic design
I've ever experienced. Managed to strain a foot muscle dealing with 10 PM
Paris traffic jam on Friday. The seat doesn't go back and so you sit on top
of the gas pedal and have to hold your foot in a constant V angle.

Porsche victory aside, one of the high points was the post-race attempt at
drag racing in the camping area. About 6 guys with pompadour haircuts in a
convertible '65 Bonneville did their impersonation of a smoky burnout (on a
dirt road). I thought they were Japanese tourists (who else would have a
uniform club haircut) but one of the PCA GB folk said they were Dutch. South
Molluscans or something?

The word from Porsche's racing dept is that BMW is really steamed. They
expected to win (with their army of Mclaren F1s) and even chartered a
special train from Munich to bring executives and guests along to share in
the experience <g>. I think the Greeks had a word for this, it's called
"hubris."

Tony Hatter, the English stylist responsible for the 993 body, came by the
PCA/GR camp several times. This year's PCA/GR -GB t-shirts were a big hit
with
the factory team, (lots of factory folk, mechanics and friends, walking
around with "our" T-shirts) and he was autographing the back (whiteline
drawings of Porsches on a blue field) for everybody.

I ought to scan one of mine in, maybe we can work a deal here online to
import them and sell them to Porschefans. The proceeds go to support PCA/GR,
a region that has fallen on hard times, membership wise, now that peace has
broken out and there are fewer Americans in Germany to join up.

Uh. lessee, what else happend. In one of those car ironies, I dragged Porsche
356 parts to Germany, and dragged more 356 parts back. Took over two rear
fender sections for a friend who needs to unflare the rear wheel arches of
his Roadster, a shift rod for same, and a set of script and badges for
another guy's Speedster. Also some pre-ball-joint Beele front suspension
rubber bits. Brought back an entire 356 trunk floor repro sheet metal
stamping and a new Leistritz 356 muffler. 

Sunday night went to a Gin Blossoms/Melissa Etheridge/Bryan Adams concert in
Karlsruhe. They don't know the Gin Blossoms yet, and the GB's sound system
was not particularly well set up, but I thought they were pretty good.
(Somebody says top act always gets the best sound setup). Etheridge's sound
was better, and Adams was formidable.

Found a great place to hang out in Frankfurt when waiting for a flight. It's
in Terminal 2, which of the American carriers I think is used only by Delta
(American and United come in at Terminal 1). It's called the Laxx Restaurant
and Bar, has an American diner theme, pretty well done, fairly authentic. I
spent over an hour playing with the (free) Wurlitzer juke box. TV carried CNN
and replay of Canadian GP. Hey, what better way to kill time for your flight
than playing old Byrds and Jan & Dean tunes?

Pete
