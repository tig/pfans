I don't really think there is a difference between "transmission" oil
and "gear" oil.  Actually, call it anything you want - it's the specs on
the bottle, the weights, etc., that define what it's application is.  It has
been my experience (every vehicle I have ever owned) that the
differentials and the transmission (and the gearbox of my 911) all
require the same type of lubricant.  IMO, I don't even think that
you will notice any major differences between the lubricating
capabilities of 75W90, 80W90 or straight 90W gear oil.  I have
even used 85W140 before (not in a pcar).  Other than the Honda
application, the only other non-standard situation that comes to mind
is LSDs that require a viscosity improver additive.

Like many other things, make your decision, pay your money, and
be happy.  Some people swear by Swepco, but, hey, it's just a
gearbox, there are many other lubricants that will work just fine
in there.
