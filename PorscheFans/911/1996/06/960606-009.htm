Hi all,

I have another tensionsioner question.  I have an '85 engine in my '79SC.
For awhile now I have been hearing "odd" sounds coming from the engine as
it warms up.  It is of the normal whine plus a G-R-R etc. sound.  It
usually only happens above 2500RPM after the engine has been running in the
morning for a couple of minutes.  It goes away at about 140 deg.  If the
car gets really warm (210-220) and I shut it off and restart it in 3 hours,
the sound is much worse and starts at a lower RPM.

Last night, I dropped the car off at RMG in Summyvale (he was highly
recommended) and met him this morning.  We started it up and it made the
sound again.  Well, he thinks it might either be a broken valve spring or a
tensiones going out.  Does this sound reasonable?  It has been making this
sound for about 2 tune ups at another shop and a broken valve spring never
showed up (maybe they weren't looking - I assume they would).  On the
tensioner side of the dabate, I was under the understanding that they made
noise at idle if they were on their way out.

Once the engine is warm, the engine sounds fine, except for a valve that
always makes noise sooner than the others.  That's one reason this sound
has been so hard to track down, by the time I get the car anywhere, it is
running well.  Is there any other things that we could check - something we
missed, maybe.  He is at a loss if it isn't one of these 2 things.

Thanks for any insite!

Chris

PS, thanks to all who replied about the brake rotors.  I think I'll attempt
it soon.  I need to find somewhere to do the work as our apartment isn't
too keen on people working on thier own cars - another reason for us to try
and find a house we can live with.
