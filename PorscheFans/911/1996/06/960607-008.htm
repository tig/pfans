Hi,

Thanks to Pete and others for pointing me to the new list!   

After an autox at the Meadowlands in May, I took off my air cleaner and found 
some engine oil in the back of the plastic housing.  There was maybe 5 
tablespoons.  This seems to be an odd place for oil to be collecting.  Is 
there some sort of crankcase breather hose which connects to the air-cleaner? 
If not, what are the possible sources of the oil?  Also, saw my oil temp climb
up to 250^ with a RF fender Terbatrol oil cooler.   I thought maybe my 
thermostat was bad but both oil hoses were hot to the touch.  Are there any 
sure-fire ways to test the thermostat? 

TIA, 

Steve Jagernauth '74 911/3.0, '87 951
