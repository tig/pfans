OK boys and girls, here's a real fun one:

Has anyone R&R'd the fuel distributor (aka the mixture control unit) in a 
CIS car?  We're talking about the part that sits atop the engine 
sprouting seven fuel lines--connected to the air-flow sensor.  This is on 
a '75 911S.

I have reason to believe that mine is infested with crap, gunked up, or
otherwise not running to spec.  The major symptom is occasional
hesitation, usually on hard acceleration or during sharp, low-speed
turns.  The problem tends to manifest during the first sustained throttle 
bashing of any given day, persist for a little while (like say one 
autocross lap) and then go away for the day.

I'm 95% sure this isn't due to electrical gremlins--I've spent a good few 
hours poking and prodding and cleaning contacts, to no avail.  Several 
other subtle hints lead me to a diagnosis of fuel system difficulties.

The injectors all look good, and give a good pattern, though flow thru #1 
is below spec (which may explain my occasional detonation).  I'm left 
with two obvious possibilities:

* Low fuel pressure (but the car runs strong the rest of the time...)

* Crap in the fuel distributor

A third possibility is the control pressure regulator, but that just 
occured to me, and I have to think about it some more.

I plan on testing the fuel pressure, and if it's ok, moving on to the 
fuel distributor, which I think is the more likely culprit.

My mechanic says the mixture control unit isn't repairable--just toss it 
and buy a new one.  But I'm willing to try and coax some more life out of 
mine, since the only price I've seen for this thing is $1000 from the 
dealer (which tells me that the cheapest I'm likely to find it for is 
$500).

So, has anyone tried pulling it out, cleaning it, and reinstalling?  I 
know I need to get new gaskets, but what else?  Any tips?

Does anyone know where I can get a new mixture control unit for a decent 
price?

Does anyone in the SF Bay Area want to loan me a CIS pressure gage 
widget?

Thanks for your help.
