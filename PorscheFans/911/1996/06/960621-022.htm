The problem has to be downstream if there is water coming out of the other 
one. It should be fairly easy to check, basically teh problem has to be in 
the little plastic check valve which is right below the nozzle (inside the 
luggage compartment), or the nozzle itself is plugged with some crap 
further inside than a pin can reach or the hose has come off and you are 
filling the luggage compartment with windshield wiper fluid.....

Easy way to fix it is to remove the hose from the check valve, put it into 
a jar and activate the washer, if fluid comes out, then, everything 
upstream of the check valve is fine. I would then (with the check valve 
disconnected) take an air hose with a blower nozzle, apply it so that it is 
blowing upstream (ie back toward the pump) and then let the air pressure 
clean things out for you. If you don't have access to an air compressor and 
nozzle, most service stations will generally give you a hand...

One thing to beware of, if you consistently get this sort of problem, you 
could have crap in the washer tank or system or potentially your hose is 
begining to deteriorate and the crumbs are clogging things up. I would 
consider draining the tank and rinsing it out with a hose....awkward to get 
at though...
