>The sales guy at Turbotronics said the temps I am seeing are not
a cause for concern.  Of course a guy at Powerhaus rolled his eyes
so severely I could sense it over the phone. He insinuated the car
would hit critical mass if I did not upgrade immediately to the
set-up _racers_ use... (behind the valence, ram air, etc.).

>Opinions appreciated.


Our personal max temp while running 600 hour endurance runs on the dyno at
Porsche (for non-Porsche engines but that doesn't matter) was I think 130 deg
C which is 266 F. 120 C was more typical but it could get up to 130. Of
course we changed oil regularly. Modern oils can take more heat before
breaking down than the stuff of 20 years ago. You really WANT the oil to get
above 100 C, 212 F, to get the condensate water out of it. 

As for the Powerhaus guy, he's trying to sell you something. Porsche designed
the car to work and survive with the oil temps you are likely to see under
any conditions with a standard, unmodified engine in non-racing situations.
If you race it or modify it for more power, yes, then you might have to look
at the excess waste heat situation.
