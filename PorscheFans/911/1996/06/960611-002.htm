I'm having no luck at all getting the tires (BFG CompTA 195/65 on 6x15 Fuchs
alloys-on 1973 911) balanced. I forget how many time I've had them reset.
I've had them rim-matched on a new, recalibrated, machine and the problem
still remains. The owner/operator of my tire shop is a good friend of mine
and is doing everything he can think of to find the problem.

The wheel bearings have been checked,repacked, and set to specs. No movement
when tire/wheel is rocked.

I had a slight wheel vibration before going to Putnam Park 2 weeks ago. The
tires were rebalanced before I went !! Not much differance after approx 100
track miles. Last weekend I cross-rotated the tires to  minimize outside
tread wear, and the problem got worse. Yesterday they reset and balanced all
4 tires and the problem was worse. I think I have one tire that  is causing
the vibration, but it balances out OK. The rims have no damage to any of
them (that I can, see-no scrapes, ect.) Today I'm dropping it off the have
them checked for run-out, ect. They are going to spin them on the car to see
if they can find the bad one !!  These tires have about - 2thou mile on
them, so they are relatively new (-500 track miles)
I'm leaving for Blackhawk Farms Thur. afternoon, so I'm getting down to
crunch time !!!!

Any help appreciated.....

BTW, anyone got an 74+ front oil cooler and lines they want to get rid of
for a decent price-- my temp was a little above 250 last weekend, and it
wasn't that warm out !!
