Got two votes so far.  But this is gonna be a busy day and

Nate writes about T*d:

| What exactly did this guy do, anyway?  He sounds pretty legendary,
| as most of the times I've seen his name mentioned it was spelled T*d. 
| How could somebody be such an asshole that he could be rejected by
| pfiles (who have put up with my most stupid of questions?)

As an historian of the ousting of T*d, I would like
to recount the following incidents for the edification of those
who were not on the list at the time. T*d  appeared on the
list and caused heated flame wars on many subject including
the following crimes:


1.  Claimed skinny tyres and wheels always improve 911 handling

2.  Claimed racing on public roads was KOOL

3.  Suggested that "the English is all screwed up" in the
    Haynes manual, which caused much hilarity here in Europe.  Seems
    he is totally unaware that his dialect is not commonly spoken in 
    the English speaking world.

4.  Empirically demonstrated that early 911 power to weight
    ratio was superior to late models.   Once his math error
    was corrected, evidence contradicted his claim. Then suggests
    that power to weight ratio was unimportant in 911 performance.

5.  Unable to accept that he was wrong on any technical matter
    even when presented with factual evidence

6.  Claimed cheapo Wall-mart shocks better and longer lasting
    Bilstein or Koni.

7.  Kerb surfed his 911 as a demonstration of his driving prowess

8   Locked his keys in 911 with engine running, calls SO to
    bring spare keys, can't find them, breaks window (with head I expect)
    to get in. Wonders why everyone laughed at this story

9.  Claims Japanese sports cars are "better" than Porsche

10. Caused Stan to write three warnings including including the
    classic

   | Ted,
   |
   | I've had about enough of this crap. 

11. Started his own 911 email list, because Porschephiles not good enough
    for him, enrolled lots of porschephiles members without asking!

12. Autocrossed his 911 with four different tyres, including different
    sizes and manufaturers on the same axle!

13. Proved himself unable to stay on the course while autocrossing and
    clocked up times that could be beaten by a man with one leg on
    on a bicycle.

14. Was banned from the list due to massive public demand, then mail bombed
    list and individuals causing the list to be shut down for two
    days while emergency anti-Ted filters set up.

15. Wasted the Listmeisters time.

16. Caused me to write the following commemorative poem.

    Ted gone, forever
    roadkill on the infobahn.
    Listmeister got him, splat.

Regards

Ben

Subject: The T*d.

 
Ben left out some great T*d D*tails.
 
The lockout incident -- he called a locksmith. Locksmith finally got a tool
down inside the door to unlock it, but scratched glass in the process.
Windshield as I recall. T*d wanted to sue him for it. It was this incident
that made me suspect that T*d was a counterfeit personality, because this is
the stuff of an old Urban Legend -- locksmith unlocks door, owner complains
about price or scratches or something, locksmith takes keys out of owner's
hand, throws them back in car, locks door, drives away. Classic.
 
Curb (or do you say Kerb) Surfing -- he bent some alloy wheels in the process.
Claims that he knows a shop that will unbend them, good as new. He tried to
foist these wheels off on P'philes for months, it seemed. If I remember, he
also had an air leak from one wheel, but didn't connect the dots inside his
brain...
 
Claims steel wheels are dangerous, ignoring the fact that most cars ever made
rolled on steel wheels. Says forged aluminum wheels fracture, cast wheels bend
nicely and safely. He should know.
 
Japanese shocks (KYB) are better because the Japanese are much more careful
craftsmen than those feelthy Germans. We suspect that he has one of those
rare made-in-Japan 911s.
 
The four different tires for autocrossing -- I came up with the comment that
he had "an entire Franklin Mint Collection of Classic Performance Tires on
his car." I'm proud of that one, if I do say so.
 
Autocrossing -- his hot-sh*t 77 or whatever 911, with 3 liter and 4 different
performance tires and KYB shocks was beaten in T*d's first-ever slalom
outing by both members of a husband/wife team (also on P'philes) driving a
bone stock 1971? 911 T, the bottom of the Porsche performance hierarchy at
that time, also on their first outing, and not just beaten, but beaten like
a drum -- 5 seconds on a 50ish second course? T*d claimed that even if he
clobbered the cones after the finish and hence got a DNF, he had a faster
run.
 
When he started mail bombing all P'philes with his own list, and even
multiple copies thereof, and repeated requests over two days did not stop
the posts, I fixed the problem on my end by calling the legal
department at his place of employment and leaving a nastygram. The posts
to my account stopped immediately.
 
Things have been sort of boring since Stan threw The T*d off the list, but
it had to be done. Fortunately, yesterday I discovered that The Spirit of
T*d lives. I needed to do some small stuff at the local community college
body and fender class. There is a guy there replacing a rear fender on a 914
1.7. He asked me if it is possible to move the rear suspension inward about
an inch on each side. "Why would you want to do that?" So's I can put on
great big wide wheels and tires. "Why don't you do what the factory did?
Instead of moving in, move out. Put on the 916-type flares." Naah, I don't
like dat Look. "You realize that even if you can move the pickups inward, you
will have to do all sorts of other stuff, like shorten the halfshafts?" Yeah.
So what? "What engine are you going to use in all this?" Uhh, just the
reg'lar one that's in there now.
 
At that point I gave up. (This guy has never, ever finished any of his
projects.)
