Pete, Bob
I just got the Factory manuals for my 993 and I looks like the best way to
disable the ABS system would be to remove a 60 amp fuse that is located
under the hydraulic unit's cover.  There is a second fuse in the same
place labeled BPAU pump which I dont know anything about, but it might be
the boost pump for the C4's.   Alternately you could remove the two
relays that are there.  This will eliminate the power to the valves and
pump.  On the cars with the electric brake boost system you will need to
check that you still have boost, but it looks like you should.  I will try
to figure this out when I have more time.  These diagrams are not real
easy to use.  I suspect that one probably should not remove power to the
ABS control unit.  I am not sure about this, but the speed signal to the
speedometer may come through this box.  I cannot find anything on these
diagrams that show any speed sensor anywhere on the drivetrain.  So about
the only plausable answer is that the speed may be read from the ABS wheel
sensors.  I haven't had time to figure this out so if anyone has any ideas
on this please say so.

All of the above is the work of an automotive amateur, so take it for what
it is worth.   When I can get the time I will investigate it further if
any one wants the information.

Regards
Tom Smith
