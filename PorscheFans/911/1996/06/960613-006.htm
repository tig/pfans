In retrospect I see i should have posted the compleate article I received.
Here's the rest of it.
Usual disclaimers apply IE: not my info and I'm not an employee of Raceware nor
do I have any financial relationship with them.

                    Torque Friction & Fasteners 
                          (2nd page)

 When you use a torque wrench to install a threaded fastener, the wrench is
actually used to apply and measure a force. The force is designed to
PROPERLY tension the fastener so it can perform it's job properly. If the
fastner is under or over tightened, it will prematurly loosen  or fail.
Torque wrenches do not measure TENSION, they measure TORQUE. In the case of
a threaded  fastener, torque is the radial force applied to overcome
friction in the threads and to streach or tension the fastener.

 In quality threaded fasteners as much as 80% of the torque applied to
tighten them is used to overcome the friction in the threads. Only about 20%
of the force is used to actually tension the fastener. That means that any
change ins the FRICTION has DRAMATIC effect on tension. All quality
fasteners have specific installation instructions that dictate what
lubricant if any should be used when tightening the fastener. Lubricants
such as motor oil, anti-seize, moly lube, cam lube, STP(tm), ect, ALL have
different friction characteristics.

 USING THE WRONG LUBRICANT CAN CHANGE THE  THREAD FRICTION BY AS MUCH AS
30%,  CAUSING A FASTENER TO BE IMPROPERLY  TENSIONED.

 Thread design and pitch also have a great effect on Torque and Tension.
Fine threads exert a greater tension on a fastener for the same amount of
Torque applied. This is because of the angle on the threads is smaller and
therefore the 'wedge"  effect is greater. Thus if you tighten a fine thread
fastener to the same torque as a coarse thread fastener, the fine thread
fastener will have a higher tension, and clamping force. (clamping force is
the force created  by a fastener that holds two or more parts together.) Due
to the difference in friction and "wedge" effect, fine threaded fasteners
are often tightened to a LOWER torque the coarse threaded fasteners, to
prevent over-tightening and failure.

 Friction in a threaded fastener assembly is effected by many variables
including but not limited to: thread design, thread  pitch, lubricant,
smoothness of surfaces, if a washer is used or not, LENGTH of thread
engagement, and fastener design, (i.e. a bold verses a nut), just to name a
few. When a bolt is tightened into an existing hold like a block or head
installation, friction is present at BOTH the threads and the bolt head. The
length of the  thread engagement effects friction and torque. A nut has
considerably shorter, (in most cases), thread engagement than a bolt.
Therefore it is not necessary or desirable to tighten a nut to as high a
torque as  a bolt,  because the nut has less friction to overcome to
properly tension the fastener.

(&& here's where the add starts)

 Race-Tech replaces head and main bearing bolts with stud kits because stud
kits offer many advantages over bolts. Quality stud kits properly align
components, evenly distribute loads in the block and head, include hardened
washers, and are re-usable in comparison to the typical original equipment,
"stretch" bolts.

 RACEWARE head stud kits are supplied with Aircraft style 12 point nuts and
have an exclusive anti-friction coating that lowers friction and improves
tightening accuracy, a common problem with other fasteners. In addition all
RACEWARE stud kits come with  precision ground, hardened washers to properly
distribute the clamp force. You can easily see the difference between
RACEWARE head stud kit and other fasteners when you check the torque after
installation has been compleated.

 If you test the final torque on other fasteners there is a higher "break
away" torque than turning torque. What this means is that it takes
considerably more torque to break the nut or bolt loose, than it takes to
continue turning after "break away". With Raceware Aerospace Quality Head
Stud Kits, there is no "break away" torque because our exclusive
anti-friction coating and aerospace thread design eliminates the extra
friction experienced in lesser fastener designs. This is one of the reasons
why Raceware fasteners my actually be tightened to a LOWER of DIFFERENT
SPECIFICATION THEN THE OEM FASTENER, yet the Raceware fastener will all ways
perform better.

ALWAYS follow the Raceware installation instructions and contact us if you
have any questions.We are here to help you get the best performance and
reliability from you engine.

This was not ment to be an add. I don't know whether or not Raceware's
claims are true or not (but would tend to believe them). The information
content was higher then the add content hence it's posting :-)
