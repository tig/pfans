I know that some chips have circuitry to prevent them from
being read by an ordinary PAL/PROM programmer for the purposes 
of duplication.  I seriously doubt that any DME chip manufacturer
would allow their software to be copied so easily, especially 
when it's priced at several hundred dollars.  It sucks, but
these guys have to protect themselves from competitors and
pirates. 

Might I humbly suggest that your chip warranty should function
as your backup device, and to forget about trying to copy a
device that you could damage in the attempt.
