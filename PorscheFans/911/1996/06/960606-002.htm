Once more with the dumb questions from someone just getting their new toy on 
the road. How does one test the rev limiter on a 911? I have both the fuel pump cut 
off (as I relocated the fuel pump to the front and while I was at it I installed the  
relay out of the SC) and the distributor cutoff (standard on the 1978 Euro engine 
which is the basis of my engine).

I have revved it to about 6700 rpm, with no apparent cut off occurring, but I am 
fearful to go much higher ... I don't want my valves/pistons etc to have a conflict of 
location. Any ideas as to how to test?? Can I safely rev my engine higher....should 
I do it under load (like 3rd gear on a nice piece of road ...heh heh heh) or am I better 
 off doing it on the driveway .... What does it sound/feel like??

Comments, ideas much appreciated...
