I've had this question myself but I seem to be working my way through 
products in an attempt to find the right one. Here's what I did; the 
first thing I tried was a product called Liquid Glass. I bought it last 
summer before I began reading PorschePhiles or joining PCA so I didn't 
really have much of a chance to ask other car owners what to use. Well, 
Liquid Glass turned out to be a little too abrasive for my tastes. A 
*lot* of the paint was coming off. The car did look great, though, but 
since I don't have a garage to store it in, it faded kinda quickly in the 
Texas sun. Fast forward to the present. My shop is recommending a product 
called Mequire's. Specifically, Mequire's Number 6 to wax and Mequire's 
Number 7 to seal the wax. I tried a little on the fender of my car and 
the fading went away. It looks beautiful and little paint came off at 
all. I bought the two bottles and I'm going to try it out this weekend on 
the whole car. I also bought a car cover to keep the thing from fading 
after I wax it. Has anyone else tried Mequire's? Heard any good/bad 
things about it? Is there anything better than it? Thanks!
