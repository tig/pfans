I, for one, have no problem with the idea of Porschephiles not returning.

I learned a great deal about Porsches and have made a few very good friends
on Porschephiles and for that I'm grateful. But that list was way too much
work to run manually and Stan refused to accept any help. As a result of the
inadequate maintenance the complaints never ceased. Also there were untold
potential contributors that never gained access so we all lost out.

This list has already solved those 2 problems, quickly and completely. I'm
glad it's here and will support it fully.

FWIW,

Jim Coshow
