I had the same problem with my 911...that stuff is held on with gorilla 
snot and will not come off without more damage than it is worth. I assume 
that any part which has loose chunks have been removed, what I would 
suggest (and have done) is to use a good rust paint on any metal which is 
exposed, then get some new self adhesive anti-drum sheets (its called sound 
deadener sometimes) and then carefully piece (sort of jig saw puzzle like) 
and cut the new stuff to fit into the old stuff. Turns out it is a bit 
stretchy so it can be quite good. The refinish if you will and you are 
done...only should take a couple of hundred hours, but oh well, life is 
long and we need to fill it some how...
