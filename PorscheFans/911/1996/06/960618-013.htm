A couple of solutions:  Deka makes a direct replacement, and most cities 
have a dealer for them.  These are the batteries that Imparts sells (or 
at least sold) with the labels torn off.  Imparts has a pretty good price 
on them, but sends them dry; you have to add acid.

Second choice is to mount a single sealed battery on it's side in the 
left opening. The battery of choice is the Optima battery. 
<http://www.ultimate-energy.com/>.  It is a sealed 12 volt automotive 
battery that can be mounted upsidedown without leaking.  Just disconnect 
the battery cables on the right hand side, mount the Optima on it's side 
on the driver's left, fashion a strap to hold it in, and have much more 
cranking power with NO fear of acid leaking.  There is a regular 
classified section advertiser (can't remember the name) in Excellence for 
the batteries for $129 including shipping.
