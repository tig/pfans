I'm using a 9" wheel on the rear...  The 8.5 would be OK with the 245 =
according to Anderson's performance handbook) but I would stay with the =
225's if I were you.  If the tire is too wide for the rim, any =
anticipated "gains" with the wider rubber would be negated by a =
distorted tire patch.

Take care...

Dave, just a question here.  What size of rim are you using for the =
245x45VR16s? I replaced my tires a while back and bought some
Yoko's AOO8Ps, excellent tires BTW.  I only went with the=20
225x50VR16 for the rear Fuchs.  I wanted the 245 (which really
wouldn't be that much bigger or noticeable) but I don't suppose they
would have been proper for my rear rim size.  It's an 87 Carrera
with 16" Fuchs, I'm assuming the rear is an 8 or 8.5" and not
the 9" of the Turbo...any comments if I decide to go with the
245 next time?

Joe
