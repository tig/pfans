Geert,

I have replaced shift linkage bushings in both of my 912's that I have 
owned and just did it in my 73 911T.  The first thing I  would try would be 
to remove the cover plate between the rear seats,  There is a U-joint there 
that connects the shift rod to the tranny rod.  On the shift rod side of 
the U-joint there is a collar that tightens the U-joint connector to the 
shift rod.  I would loosen this collar a bit and try repositioning the 
shift linkage.  If you rotate the linkage clockwise the shift lever will 
move in the opposite direction (to the left) and visa versa.  The changes 
in shifting ease can be tremendous with even the slightest adjustment.  I 
do not know of any exact way to make this adjustment except do it and try 
it, if it makes it worse or doesn't help redo it.  Some one out there may 
have a more "precise" way to make this adjustment.  Just be aware gear 
engagement is very sensitive to the rotational position AND the relative 
(front to back) position.  While you are in there check out the bushings on 
the U-joint.  Being it's an '84 they are probably shot.  If the bushings 
are shot you need to press out the pin to replace the bushings.  There is 
also a nylon cup that the shift lever connects to and a nylon collar for 
the shift rod to pass through under the shift lever .  These two parts cost 
about $15 and take about an hour (max!) to replace and can make an 
incredible difference in shifting.

Good luck!

Scott
