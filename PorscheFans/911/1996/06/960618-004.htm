First, congratulations. It's a good buy.

Second, *please* revise the order of the work in your last paragraph.

*DO NOT* drive the car without performing the rust repair first.

You will need a front suspension pan at least, and possibly a front clip as
well as a floor pan. Also, you may have corrosion damage in the rocker
panel box sections which are the main 'frame' elements. Additionally, the
rear torsion bar tube area may be weakened. The best thing for you to do
with this car is strip it, brace it and put it on a 'rotisserie' for
chassis reconstruction. Otherwise you risk suspension collapse and the
resulting loss of control. Rust is a serious problem with early 911s.

This is from bitter experience.
