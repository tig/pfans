About a year ago, just after the T*d debacle, I was looking at some auto 
storage space in Mtn. View Cal.  This fellow had a couple of warehouses that 
he had turned into "classic" car storage. Pretty nice setup with 24hr. access, 
alarm, auto sprinklers, etc.  There were a couple of exotics that belonged to 
his partner, a mid year Vette, Pantera, and he pointed out that he had another 
Porsche there which would then make two if I stored one of mine there.  Sure 
enough, under a cover was a beater 911, brown and tattered, with several 
different brands and sizes of tires on it.  He says,"The owner just brought it 
in.  He's off working in Japan for a year or so"  Uh, what's his name? "I 
think his first name is the same as yours and he's uh, Asian"..... "Thanks, 
says I, I gotta go, we'll be in touch",  and I beat feet to the door..jumped 
in the car and screamed "AARRRRRGH" as I hastily drove off......
