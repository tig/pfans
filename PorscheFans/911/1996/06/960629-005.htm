The unit is the standard DIN series, and uses two separte plugs.  on the back
right, looking from the rear, is a 6 pin molex connector that covers the power,
ground, constants 12V, antenae 12v. and something else, maybe switched or not.
Then just to the top left of that is the antenae in, again, standard.  Lastly,
there is a DIN connector, 3/4" round with pins, that is for the RCA front and
REAR speaker leads.  This is for signal out.  First, the signal gets routed to
the AMP, then goes to the speakers.  The unit allows front to rear fading, left
to right balance.  Seperate controls for tone and bass.  Programming of the CD
player, two FM presets with six buttons each.  Easy loading and unloading on the
top.  Very stable playback, even with stiff susptensions.  If your system is
already amped, you would simply plug this one into the dash and hook up the
RCAs.  IF not, you need to wire the AMP.  What are you currently using?

Call for more help.
