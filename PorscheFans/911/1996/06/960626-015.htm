My $.02 on the Carrera/911 price thread.  I think Southern CA is the best
place to look for ALL models of Porsche - the thing is though, you can't just
arbitrarily say the prices are low here. Actually, we have some of the most
overpriced Pcars you'll ever see - but, because the tremendous number of cars
here, the prices can vary widely and they give the "shopper" and patient
buyer a chance to buy cars very reasonably. Rest assured though, there are
plenty of LA cool car dealers that will take as much or more money than you
can spend on a given car in other parts of the US.  The concept of a Calif
car is still valid - the weather doesn't take much of a toll on Pcars from
the '80s, but expect high miles unless you look patiently. Without regard for
model or miles, my own June newsletter had the following "low" prices for '85
- '89 3.2L Carreras: '85 16,900, '86 18,995, '87 16,500, '88 21,000, '89
22,900, and these were the "highs": '85 28,900, '86 31,000, '87 39,000, '88
35,000, '89 36,000 (BTW, the highs are mostly Cabs). Those are cars from all
over the US (over 125 in all), so you can see, the possibility exists to find
a "deal" within the ranges.

I'm rambling... but to the person that started this thread - be patient and
keep looking, there are good deals out there.
