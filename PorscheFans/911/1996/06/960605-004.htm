to my questions, thanks!

I hit the jackpot finding you, wasn't sure there were any 993
owners on this very new list.

The M030 should be standard on the C4S and turbo, and
optional on the C2 and C4.

Thanks, I hoped the C2 shifter would be better than the one 
on the C4S.

Wow, that's a great testimonial to Porsche's AWD system.

Interesting, this tells me that the C2 handles better even with
the better suspension on the C4S, as the C4S's '96 engine should
be stronger (more than enough to offset the extra weight).
I'd think your C2 would be even better with the 235/45/17 on the
front, rather than the very small stock-size 205/50/17.

It sure does. I wonder why they sell the normal C4 at all,
does anyone order one? (no flames to C4 owners intended).
The C4S aero package is AWESOME looking! My dealer/
sponsor Danbury Porsche got in a black one and it's the
best looking car I've ever seen. I don't think the owner
wants to sell it! But it's a lot (~$6,000) for spoilers...

That's what I think too, but at 100% I wonder if the AWD can
actually help? In solo-II, to win a major event, you have to 
drive at 100% for most of the course and exceed it in a few
places without crashing. At the race track one is RARELY near
100% except in the slower turns with lots of runoff. How do
they feel at 101%+ ?

That's a good plan. Just several tens of thousands of obstacles
implementing it...

Isn't it about time that Dionne Warwick and MCI merged?
