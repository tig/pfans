Steve:

Yes, you CAN buy such things, but they're EXTREMELY expensive...
hundreds and hundreds of dollars the last time I bought one.  The
reasons for the high cost have mostly to do with problems involved
with minimizing lead-lengths to the PROM pins.

What you might want to do, instead, is simply plug a ZIF socket into 
the board... That will at least make the chip-changing process easy 
and keep you from accidentally bending any pins.

ZIF sockets are available everywhere... Here's an appropriate part
number from Digi-Key (1 800 344-4539):

    A301-ND - 24-pin Aries ZIF socket w/ gold-plated contacts.
              $10.16.

Personally, I prefer 3M sockets, but Digi-Key only carries Aries.  I 
don't think you'll have a problem, though.
