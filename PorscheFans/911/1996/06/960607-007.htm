A handful of list members have apparently been auto-dropped by the system. It
does that when for whatever reason it can't get through to post messages to
their mailboxes -- for example if your mailbox is full, or your system went
down for any reason, or you went on vacation, and it tried to post to you and
failed.

We'll work on that, there is probably a software switch to turn this
"feature" on or off. Meanwhile, be aware that if you suddenly get nothing
from PorscheFans, you may have been auto-dropped for some reason, so just
resubscribe (send blank message to porschefans@ioio for info etc).

Fortunately Jim Bergman gets a sysop message whenever somebody gets
auto-dropped (there have been about a dozen so far) and tries to send them a
message explaining what happened and put them back on, but he has a day job
too and doesn't always get to it right away.
