I just compleated the rebuilding of front calipers and  replacement of master
on a  1984  Carrera (for a freind) and  rebuild of the fronts on  my 80sc.
On the  84  I was compleatly unhappy with the condition of the inner and
outer wheel  bearings. I recomended replacement.  I have replaced bearings
on my  66
before and it's  pretty straight forward. The one area that can be no  fun  is
removal of the races. Due to the fact that the carrier is  alloy removal,
can be a hassle. After they are removed,  reinstalation without  a press
can be just as  much fun. I saved a set of  races that I have cut a surface
on the outside and the inside so that I can  remove  the old ones (used to
install the new ones) with  a chisel. It's pretty effective. I wouldn't
recomend it to anyone as it is realy easy to install the races at an angle.
On the 84 I sent them to  a  machine shop for removal and  reinstalation and
it was *well* worth the $20, especialy since it's not my car.

 It's  funny, when you want to do a "simple" replacement job, inorder to  be
correct and sure of  a lasting repair, how much one gets into. 

Rotor and pad replacemnet is pretty straight forward (to answer your question).
It's the "while I'm here" things that allways seem to happen.  I'm pretty hooked
on the "while I'm here" stuff because as much as I enjoy and  marvel at the
mechanical systems, I  prefer them to be  renewed. Have you rebuilt the
calipers and replaced the bearings before? If not..... while your  there :-)
