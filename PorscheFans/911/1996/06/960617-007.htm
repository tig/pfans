Do a PCA driving school first....pick a good track with lots of run off... 
Not that you will need it, only that it is good to have. 
 
You can attend one of these schools for a 10th of the price. 
If you like it then try another track....then do the big $$$ 
school. 
 
I might just be lucky ...but we have some very good instructors in 
my region so I feel I'm getting more than my $$ worth. 
 
This will alos let you have an instructor who has the same 
type car as you do....big plus...experience counts here..... 
Only my $0.02......

P.S : Don't know where you live..but Robeling (Spelling..???) Rd in 
Savanah, Ga is a great place to start....no walls lots of run off. 
And a great place to learn skills....not just going fast down  
a straight (you can do that too!!!). Lots of decreasing radius turns... 
and it is getting paved in july...so it will be smooth ...... 
.. 
We have an event there in OCT....I love that place. Best of luck on your 
choice.

Does anyone have experience, attending a driving school, that they would 
like to share? I am in the HEAVY debate stage of signing up for one. I'm 
looking for input regarding schools that provide open wheel cars (like 
formula fords). I understand that some schools will help you find a ride 
(Barber Saab, Toyota Atlantic, Indy Lites) if they think you are talented 
enough.  I figure now's the time to see if I have what it takes to ever 
hope to be professional driver. If not...at least I tried. It should be a 
blast either way. 

Currently I am leaning towards Skip Barber. But, $1500 for 3 days makes 
me want to hear from someone that's been before I give them my credit 
card. Thanx for any input.
