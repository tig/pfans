I thought I'd let all you MFI owners know that you should watch out when 
reconnecting the hose to your MFI thermostat.  Both my inner and outer hoses 
were missing or not fully attached when I purchased my '73S.  What I didn't 
think about when reconnecting them is that the MFI pump was most likely adjusted 
with the hoses off and in fact that was the case.  When I reconnected them 
yesterday I noticed lean popping from my engine after warmup.  

What I know is that the CO setting at the last smog test was around 1.5%, so my 
pump was already running pretty lean.  Then after reconnecting the hoses the car 
was running very lean after warmup, hence the popping and engine wanting to die 
out.  I disconnected the inner hose from the sheet metal and the car is running 
fine again.  

So if you buy an MFI car with the inner/outer hoses missing from the left heat 
exchanger through the engine sheet metal to the MFI pump thermostat, be aware 
that you will have to get the pump mixture readjusted if you reconnect the 
hoses.
