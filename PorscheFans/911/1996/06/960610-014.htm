Shri:

I'd say for once a year duty, it's fine.  However, I used mine very frequently
esp. doing some bigger jobs like timing belts/struts/clutch and it doesn't 
click anymore. It comes with a lifetime warranty but I haven't tried to 
collect on it yet. I bought a Sears beam-type first but it doesn't work well 
in tight spots when you're upside down holding stuff with both hands.  I used 
the Sears to cross-check the accuracy of the Imparts one.   I guess you get 
what you pay for when it comes to good tools.  I've bought cheap tools for 
occasional use from Harbor Freight.  They have a nice selection of offset 
wrenches etc.
