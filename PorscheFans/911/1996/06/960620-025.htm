        It's clearly labeled "MTL".  The bottle's almost the same as the
75W90, but the label's a bit different.  Don't know if it's the same
stuff or not.
        And no, it's not definite that the Red Line was the cause--the
car has N06K [N=1->???] miles on it; no idea how many of those are also
on the tranny.  However, Tony's comment was that it was "way too thin"
and that he's had problems with this and other Red Line oils.
        Tony says Swepco, I'm going Swepco.  He mentioned that they had
a lot more luck in the 24-hour Enduros when they went to Swepco--the
differentials didn't tend to blow up at the end.

>I thought only Italian cars had mechanics called "Tony." :)

        FIAT = Fix It Again, Tony!
