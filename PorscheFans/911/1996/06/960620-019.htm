The maps are not that big.  The 944 series 2 model introduction Technik
calls out the total number of data points, I think it's 4096.  You really
don't need a ton of fuel and spark data points to get a great running
engine.  And by way of comparison, compare that number to what a
carburetor has: like 3 data points!

For comparison, the fuel and spark maps in one programmable system I've
worked with have 32 throttle or manifold pressure points at every 1K RPM
range, so say it's 32 x 8.  Another system has basically two 8 x 8 tables,
one for volumetric efficiency and one for spark angle.  Both these systems
have separate, orthogonal tables for warm-up enrichment and a couple of
settings for accel and decel ramp rate.

Good question.  As things stand today, best I can tell, the systems are
modularized to the extent that the stuff you might want to swap is still
kept on a separate, socketed chip.  It will probably stay this way as long
as Bosch, etc., want to sell off-the-shelf Motronic boxes to different
manufacturers, each of whom has to match the maps to the particular engine's
VE, etc.
