(sorry for  the cross post.. posted  to 914  by accident)

I have a question that hopefully someone can answer for me. Last week it seemed
was caliper week. I  did my car and a friends. I know how the assembly and
reassembly goes, and booth jobs were sucessful. The thing that bothers  me
is that I have a lack of understanding of how the self adjusters acualy work.
I beleive that setting the 20deg angle on the piston is part of it, but how
does it work? On the 84 I could see on that back of the piston where a notch
lines up with part of the fluid port but, on the 80 there was no notch.
Does anyone have an explanation for me about how the system functions?
Enquiring minds want to know.
