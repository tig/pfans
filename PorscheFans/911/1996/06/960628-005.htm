Hello again Bruce, and welcome to the (regenerated) list.

I hope this is not a FAQ.
  I have an '84 944 with 75 000 miles that has developed a
coolant leak.  I have the head off and found nothing unusual
with the gasket sealing, but did find 3 large thin mill shavings
lodged in the cooling passages of cyl #1.  These seem to
have caused localized restriction and hot spots in that area.

  I want to have the head checked for leaks and warp, but this
aluminum head presents special consideration in testing.
  Since the motor is in otherwise good condition, and I was
not planning on having valve guides or seats redone, I just
want the head tested and flatted thinking it is a little too early
for anything more than a spring tension check and new stem
seals.  Specifically, I dont want the head shaved if possible.

  The shop I use spoke of pressure testing this head, but they
had not heard of 'zyglo'.  What processes are available today
for verifying a head's quality, and what would you suggest in
a situation as this?
