I'm curious as to what the purpose or target audience is for the Boxster
Preview  to be held in Scottsdale, Arizona on Sept 29-Oct 2, 1996.  This
"event" (described in Panorama as "once in a lifetime") will supposedly
follow the private "launch to dealers from around the world".

The well-written article that appear in Christophorus was almost like a
travelogue advertisement, beautiful pictures, etc, inviting supposedly
"well-heeled" Europeans (presumably gold-chained and Hugo Boss attired)  to
contact a travel company and sign up for an enjoyable (and expensive!) outing
including many diversion opportunities.   There seemed to be no aspirations
of targeting a particular audience of automotive enthusiasts and indeed the
glamour aspects of the location and congenial companions of the proper social
standing seemed to be the primary focus of the "event".

The short writeup (no pretty pictures) that appeared in the PCA Update
section of the May 1996 Panorama seemed to convey a very different message.
 My impression (perhaps erroneous) is that it almost cried out "DON'T
COME!....we're limited to a small group of PCA members and other sports car
enthusiasts from the US and Canada...to make sure you don't, we've made it
outrageously expensive with only a one hour test drive in the Boxster
included.  To reinforce our negative invitiation, the price is $1750 per
person, single occupancy for *three nights* payable 4 1/2 months in advance
and totally nonrefundable!"...  While a contact person is given in the
Marketing Dept of PCNA in Reno, the announcement is written with all the
*warmth* and *genuine interest in customers* that only the long gone and
unlamented Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler could appreciate!

Apparently, having a deposit on a Boxster and being a long time PCA member
and Porsche owner for over 35 years doesn't get you an invite! (even at the
ridiculous price)...at least not me!

Perhaps a journalistic *insider* (hint, hint...) could give us what's really
going on.  Is it a *glossy* travel company extravaganza or the worst
marketing campaign since Edsel Ford turned over in his grave by having his
name forever linked to an automotive version of the Titanic!
