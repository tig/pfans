Thanks for the answer!  Sometimes answers bring more questions!

1. Do the lower tab mounts on the rocker panel covers share the same =
sheet metal screw mounting bracket as the W clamp for the oil lines?

2. It seems that the captive nuts in the front fender well are located =
too low for the upward curve of the lines.  In the factory manual I read =
that when adding lines to a car with no factory lines, the three holes =
in the front fenderwell are not used and plugged up with small 10mm hex =
bolts, and that new ones are to be drilled 10" up from the bottom, 3" =
from the fender seam, and small singular clamps used there.  Any =
comment?

Thanks!

Subject: 	Re: Oil line question

The hard lines use the same mounting as the rocker panel "covers" (the=20
parts visible from the outside). Basically there is a nylon spacer =
washer=20
about 1/2 inch thick if you don't have oil lines, and the thinner ones=20
(about 1/8 inch) if you do. The split rubber sleeves are used to protect =

the oil lines themselves from clamping pressures and potential wear from =

vibration...as they are brass if they are real Porsche.
At the rear, there should be a stud on the inner right side fender=20
(threaded...8mm if I recall) which has a similar "W" type bracket which=20
holds the oil lines in the rear fender area.=20

You should have 4 "W" clamps (3 on the rocker and 1 in the rear fender=20
well). As for the hose clamps, I suspect they hold the oil lines in the=20
front fender well. There are 3 (again if I recall correctly) captive =
nuts=20
in the fender well, they will have a bolt in them as a filler, remove =
the=20
existing bolt, and use a replacement (as it is probably all munged up) =
and=20
use it to retain the lines there. Note that the fit is very precise, and =

there is not a lot of room to wiggle things....


Also note that the finish on the lines is (or at least was on mine)=20
absolute crap. They appear to have used the cheapest laquer known to=20
man....I stripped them down using laquer thinner and refinished them in=20
proper epoxy.....

Let me know if you have any further questions.....BTDT
