I posted something along these lines earlier, but apparently it didn't go out
to the digest modes so I'm posting it again, writing from memory. I feel it's
important.

People who also frequent the Porsche 356 Registry list have just witnessed a
flame war which went way beyond the bounds of reason. As a result, one person
whom I respect was thrown off that list (apparently with no public or private
notice to him), another person whom I regard as a disruption and chronic pain
in the butt on both the old Porschephiles ("Ferdinand Porsche was a war
criminal") and Registry ("Registry rips me off for overseas postage and I
demand accountability") is still active. And some third person started
flaming me, and I wasn't even involved in that flame war.

I enjoy a good flame as much as anybody else (as a few members of this list
can attest). But it can get out of hand, like the recent Registry thing. I
believe flaming is one of the principal parts of speech -- free speech -- but
that doesn't mean we have to subject the entire list to it. Until we can put
up a Flamer's Corner, which people can join or avoid as they see fit, all
five sections of this list are hereby declared FLAME FREE ZONES. 

So far, this list has been exemplary in terms of no flames. It won't stay
that way. Sooner or later the problem will arise. So what constitutes a
flame? Like the Supreme Court on pornography, "I can't define it but I know
it when I see it." (This was probably just a ploy on the part of the justices
to get to see more porn). If you're not sure whether something might be
regarded as inflammatory or not, send it to me privately first.

If people on this list bug me, by flaming ferinstance, I will throw them off.
There aren't too many things that bug me; lawyers and liars (hey, I never
noticed how close those two words are) are some of the more notable.

I'm going to  Europe next week for the Le Mans race and some visits to the
Factory and to Karmann. I will try to check in but with Germany's
diesel-powered telephone system (better than steam but not yet digital) I may
not check in as often as I'd like. So behave. Jim Bergman is watching...
