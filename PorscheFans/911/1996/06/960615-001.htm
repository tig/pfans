I was in Imola for a drive event of Gabriele Gorini Porsche Speed Training
last Monday and Tuesday with my '89 Carrera Coupe'.
She ran as a devil! I was in Imola with my Maser Spyder in 1994 thinking to
have a great fun...After 40 laps with the Carrera I understand the
difference between a fast car and a close-to-race car. The temperature was
awful (36 centigrade) and AC was just sufficient to refresh my black car; in
that punishing environment seven 993 of the school, a 964 and my '89 911 had
absolutely no problem.
No oil consumption and a very reasonable gas consumption.
Driving was wonderful: my Bilstein tune up and the Bridgestone Expedia were
fantastic, specially at the Rivazza, Variante Alta and La Tosa. We drove
also an inverse lap to test different bend lines.
The instructors (professional race drivers) were very effective.
We were at Williams and Ferrari boxes.
I'm looking forward for the next year event.
