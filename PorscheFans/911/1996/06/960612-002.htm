The noble Mark Salvetti, apparently believing Our brother Monte, and thus
feeling a false sense of security, wanters by the troll's cave without
a care in the world.  The robot speaks "DANGER, Will Robinson..."

And if Ted hasn't already mentioned it, Jim Pasha wants all to know that he 
loves and misses you, and will return to our midst once he secures an email 
account (his former account @hal.com having gone south (OK, to Japan, along with
his former job...), which should not be long hence.
