I'm sorry Jeff but all SC's turn the opposite direction to your distributor
and the drive gear on the crank is different  to yours. 
The distributor will not work in your engine. Also the CDI box for an SC has
6 electrical pins and yours should only have 3. So that will not plug in
anyway. Also the tach is different and early and late tachs and boxes cannot
be mixed.

To Pete: You asked me to contribute for pinging off to Australia so early in
the morning , so here I am.

To All: I saw 2 boxsters in the metal a couple of weeks back at the factory.
They look good and sound like a 911.... YYYYYES... well done guys. Pity they
will cost >$120000 here in OZ.

Sorry about the mixed content in 1 message I'm too lazy to write 3.
