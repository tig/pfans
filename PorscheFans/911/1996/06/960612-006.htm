        This torque wrench thing makes no sense to me.  If you twist the end
of a rod by some amount, say 1 ft-lb, the other end of which is being held
by a friend.  How hard does the friend have to twist in the opposite
direction to keep the rod from turning?  The same amount, 1 ft-lb!  Does it
depend on the length of the rod?  Not if the rod is stationary!  If nothing
is moving, the torque on each end is equal regardless of the rod's length.

        The only case in which a socket extension may affect the torque on
the bolt, is if you jerk the wrench.  In that case (I think), the elasticity
of the extension (rod) *MAY* reduce the torque seen by the bolt.  I doubt
this is a significant effect with a manual torque wrench.

        Tire shops have calibrated extensions for impact wrenches which are
intended to limit the torque to some reated value.  They have extensions
with various ratings.  Lower rated extensions are thinner.  I can see how
this could work because of the impulsive nature of the torque from the
impact wrench.  

        If you torque by hand, keep the extension in line with the bolt, and
the wrench perpindicular to same, and apply the torque slowly (don't jerk or
"bounce" the wrench), the extension length will make no difference.

        A much greater concern should be the cleanliness of the thread.  If
the bolt rotates smoothly as you are tightening it, you are getting a valid
torque (as indicated by the wrench.)  If the bolt is making a snapping, or
creaking sound as you tighten it (because it is rotating in increments, then
stopping, then rotating another increment), I'd guess the torque reading on
the wrench is less valid.  I wouldn't dare to guess the size of the error.  

        Fire away ;)
