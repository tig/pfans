You will not correct a "throttle lag" problem, but you will mess up the
driveability.  The springing was chosen to have the right damping/filtering
effect.  It's also a coarse adjustment to the enrichment -- if you cannot
get the basic mix right by adjusting the allen in the meter, you can
reposition the spring.  Damping also comes from the air mass trapped behind
the other "leg" of the flap, which sweeps into a closed chamber as the
barn door flap opens.  Again, by design.

Uh huh.  And when you make that back up, I'd recommend the extra security
of off-site storage, perhaps a friend's garage.  Of course, with chips there
is always the risk of damage from static electricity, or mechanical damage
to the pins.  What safer place to store that "back up" than, oh, how about
a DME box your friend has?  Yeah...
