Steve,

I am using the "street" (red) Konis on my '76 911.  I also have 22mm front
torsion bars and a 22mm front swaybar.  My first track event with the 22mm
torsion bars/sway bar, I also found the car to be too soft and "floaty" for the
track.  For my last track event, I set my rear shocks to the second from the
stiffest setting and I cranked about 180 degrees of rotation into the fronts
to stiffen them.  I really liked the results.  It felt just right.

To make a long story short, I think the red Konis offer a pretty good
compromise between ride comfort and control on the track.  I have
ridden in an SC with 22/28mm torsion bars and Koni Sports (yellow)
and *I* thought it was too stiff.

I'm not sure about your "fitment" questions, but I don't think inserts from
a '73 will fit your car.

Good luck,

Mike Dayton
