Hi guys,

Well, it looks that I might have developed a problem in my gear linkage 
(84 911). 

It is currently really difficult at times (50% of the time) to engage the 
gear lever in 2nd. It goes in, but with difficulty, sometimes forcing me 
to shove it in there harder than I like to. How did this happen? Well, as 
you might have guessed I violated "HappyPorscheOwning 101" and let some one 
else (a male family member roughly thirty years older than myself, but 
who shall remain nameless :) ) drive my car. As second has always been a 
bit elusive until you got the feel for it, I was horrified to learn that the 
person in question was trying to "force" the lever to second. My attention 
was drawn to this fact when I saw said person hitting the shiftknob with 
a fist into second! No kidding. 
So...what's the scenario? Something I might try first before selling 
stock? I do have a short shift kit I want to install and was planning on 
replacing the bushing in the shift lever assembly.

Thanks in advance,

Geert 
84 911
