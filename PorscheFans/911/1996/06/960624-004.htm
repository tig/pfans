Hi, saw your post regarding the G-50 rattle, I have an '87 Carrera (first 
year of the G-50 and was wondering what the rattle sounds like (I know a 
rattle, right?)
When idle I hear something, but not very loud, it kinda sounds like timing 
chain slap, but I have the hydraulic lifters and my car only has 60k miles 
on it and wasn't driven hard.  Is this the rattle we are talking about? 
-I'm using Pennzoil 80w-120...pretty satisfied with the stuff and have used 
it for the last 4 years.

Joe

The best price I was able to find is German Parts restortation in Pano
for $25.00. Other places want $35-45. Great stuff.
A couple months ago there was discussion on Porschephiles about G50
transmission noise - rattle -. When I changed to Swepco the noise was
reduced 75% .
