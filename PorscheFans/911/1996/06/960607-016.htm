Stephen-
I do not know what year your car is, but it probably does not make any
difference.  When the oil gets hot in these cars, especially if the oil
level in the tank is on the top half of the dipstick range at normal
operating temp, they can burp oil foam out the breather and into the
intake.  This as I understand it is the reason that we are cautioned not
to run the tank at the full mark.  I have also heard of situations where
a car has been run hard for the first time in a long time, and in the
process of boiling the moisture out of the oil a lot of foam is generated.
This causes the same symptons.

I suspect that if both pipes to the oil cooler are hot, that there is
circulation to the cooler and that the thermostat is ok.  I think that the
only way to know for sure is to take the thermostat apart and put the
sensing capsule in an oil bath with a thermometer, and see how its
movement compares to the thermometer.  This is a lot of work, just getting
the thermostat separated from the oil lines can be fatal to the
thermostat. Don't ask how I happen to know this.  It was a $150.00
mistake.
