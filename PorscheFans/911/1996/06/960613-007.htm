>>>     A man goes out and buys the best car available in the US 
>>>     or Europe, a 1996 Turbo BeepBeep. It is the best and most 
>>>     expensive car in the world, and it runs him $500,000.  He 
>>>     takes it out for a spin and, while doing so, stops for a 
>>>     red light.  An old man on a moped, both looking about 90 
>>>     years old, pulls up next to him.
>>>
>>>     The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car 
>>>     and asks "What kind of car ya got there, sonny?".
>>>
>>>     The dude replies "A 1996 Turbo BeepBeep.  They cost 
>>>     $500,000."
>>>
>>>     "That's a lotta money!"  says the old man, shocked. "Why 
>>>     does it cost so much?"
>>>
>>>     "Cause this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!" states 
>>>     the cool dude proudly.
>>>
>>>     The old man asks "Can I take a look inside?" 
>>>
>>>     "Sure" replies the owner.
>>>
>>>     So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks 
>>>     around.  Leaning back on his moped, the old man says 
>>>     "That's a pretty nice car, alright!"
>>>
>>>     Just then the light changes, so the guy decides
>>>     to show the old man what his car can do.  He floors it, and 
>>>     within 30 seconds the speedometer reads 320.  Suddenly,
>>>     the guy notices a dot in his rear view mirror.  It seems to 
>>>     be getting closer!
>>>
>>>     Whhhoooooooooossssshhhhhh! Something whips by him!  Going 
>>>     maybe 3 times as fast!
>>>
>>>     The guy wonders "what on earth could be going faster than 
>>>     my Turbo BeepBeeP?"  Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot 
>>>     coming toward him.
>>>
>>>     Whooooooooooosh!  Goes by again!  And, it almost looked
>>>     like the old man on the moped!  Couldn't be thinks the guy. 
>>>     How could a moped outrun a Turbo BeepBeep?  Again, he sees 
>>>     a dot in his rearview mirror!
>>>
>>>     WhoooooooshhhhhhhhKa-BbbbblaMMMMM!  It plows into the back 
>>>     of his car, demolishing the rear end.
>>>
>>>
>>>     The guy jumps out, and jeezus to betsy, it is the old
>>>     man!  Of course, the moped and the old man are hurting for 
>>>     certain.  The guy runs up to the dying old man and asks 
>>>     "You're hurt bad!  Is there anything I can do for you?" 
>>>
>>>     The old man replies "yeah. Unhook my suspenders from the 
>>>     side-view mirror on your car!"
>>>
