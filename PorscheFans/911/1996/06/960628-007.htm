Hi all:
On Sunday my brake light came on.  I just switched to DOT 5, so I figured that there was still some air trapped
in the system, so I bled the system and pressed the button on the master cylinder - but the light stayed on.
So I checked the schematic in the Haynes manual.  It showed two switches that turn on the brake light - one
from the master cylinder, and one from the emergency brake lever.  I then pulled the light from the dash,
disconnected the wires from both the emergency brake lever and the master cylinder switches, but the light
still stayed on.

I found a third, solid green wire, not in the schematic in the Haynes manual or the Mitchell manuals, that is
now grounded and is keeping the light on.  If I disconnect it, everything works OK.  But I would like to know
what it is for, before I make the decision to leave it disconnected.  Since it disappears behind
the dash, I guess I could trace it - but this would involve removing a lot of stuff in the trunk.

Could someone check the factory manuals to see what this wire is for?
Please help to solve this mystery!
Thanks in advance.
