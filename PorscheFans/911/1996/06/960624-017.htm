I'm in the process of refinishing my black-center Fuchs. I have the black
center caps with plain crest. They appear to perhaps have some kind of
anodized black finish on them, sort of like the black window trim, as
opposed to being painted. Is this correct? They have faded somewhat (you
know that slight purplish tint), and I'm sure it's going to very noticeable
once I've repainted the wheels.

Would it be correct for me to paint the caps? The crest details are pretty
fine, and I'd be worried that some of them would be lost in the paint. They
can't be sanded, obviously, so is there some other stripping
procedure/product I should use? Or are a few light coats of Wurth going to
be of negligible thickness?

Thanks!
