I know Sikkens has a mixing chart on Porsches that goes back a long 
time....certainly to 1975 and perhaps earlier. I would imagine that Glasurit would 
also have such a thing, easiest way to find out is to call the local distributor (in the 
Yellow Pages I imagine) they should be able to give you a quick answer.

If you are planning a complete repaint, this should be no problem, if it is a touch 
up or panel you are painting, remember that the sun does nasty things to paint 
over the years and you will not get a good match without custom tinting of the 
paint. In this case, a good paintman will start with the factory mix, and then tint 
and paint a number of test matches until he gets one which is acceptable. At that 
point you paint the panel...time consuming, frustrating, but results can be quite 
good on non-metallic paint and sometimes even OK on metallic colours.
