    Yes.  Since your car has a dry sump, the breather's from the oil
    tank, not the crankcase.  Same effect, though.

    If the lines between the thermostat and the oil cooler (if the
    thermostat's a separate unit) or the oil cooler itself (if the
    thermostat's incorporated into the cooler) are hot, the
    thermostat is allowing hot oil to flow to the cooler.
