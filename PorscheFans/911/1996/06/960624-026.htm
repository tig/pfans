Barney,

Thanks for the bounce.  It's really fun to read the articles that get sent to
you.

Took the car to Willow last weekend and think we've got all of the gremlins
worked out.  The car is incredible.

<< Hey just exactly how do I sign up for the new list?

Send a memo to PorscheFans-Request@ioio.com and it doesn't matter if there's
a subject or message.  They'll get back to you in one day and give you a
choice of which files you want to get.  I think you'll be impressed with
structure, etc.  I did just the digest form for 911 and 356 and haven't read
a single message about cup holders or complaints about the list as of yet.

I'll let you know for sure tomorrow, but the tour that was cancelled for July
20 will probably NOT be cancelled.  More later on that.

Monte
