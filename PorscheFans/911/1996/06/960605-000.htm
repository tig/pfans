It's not that bad. You will need some metric tools of course, and a torque
wrench is a good idea. 

Remove brake pads. 

Remove the bolts holding the caliper to the spindle, let that hang from a
hook, such as a bit of coathanger or wire to keep the weight from straining
the rubber brake line. 
Pry off the small hub cap. Sometimes sticky, try two big screwdrives on
opposite sides.

Then you undo the clamp on the axle (allen bolt on oval "nut"), unscrew that,
unscrew the big axle nut, take out the big thick washer, and wiggle the rotor
off. The manual says "strongly seated disc should be removed with a puller." 

Now you can unbolt the iron disc (rotor) from the aluminum hub. 

Now you have to get the bearings out. This is messy. You might want to just
take it to a local auto parts store that advertises "machine shop service."
Not difficult, just grease everywhere. You can get the bearing races out
yourself with a hammer and BRASS punch, to avoid marking up the soft aluminum
bores where the new races will go, but it's so much easier with the right
tool -- a hydraulic press. Cost a few bucks at worst to have a shop do it.
OK, now you've got the old bearings out, clean the grease out of everything,
buy new bearings and grease seals (since you're in there, might as well
replace those). Bolt new disc to old hub. Use right torque for those bolts.
Pack bearings, press into hub, or have shop press them in, put some grease in
the cavity, slide back onto spindle, reinstall thick washer and axle nut,
tighten axle nut while wiggling rotor until you can't turn rotor anymore
(this seats the bearings), back off axle nut, and gently retighten until a
screwdriver wedged between hub and thick washer can't slide washer around
anymore. That's as tight as you want it. Install clamping nut, little hub
cap, and bolt caliper back on. Use proper torque on caliper bolts. Not a bad
idea to replace pads if you're putting on new rotors.

All of the above is from memory. If you're going to do your own work, you
really should invest in an official factory manual. Go to the local dealer to
at least look at what he's got. Sometimes you can buy these cheaper from
Stoddard or other dealers. Here's a dealer that in the past has given good
deals to Porschephiles members: 

Ask for Linda at 
Carlsen Porsche Audi; P'philes discount
1-800-523-2408 or 1-415-856-6300
Have part # handy

(If you're at Stanford you might want to drive by there).

Some torque values you might need:
Caliper to steering knuckle..............51 ft-lbs.
Brake disc to wheel hub..................17

This and more torque specs are on p. 0.2-2/1 of Vol. 5 of the Workshop
Manual, From 1972 on. There is also a 2-volume basic manual that goes from
1965-72 and lays the groundwork for a lot of procedures that don't change
over the years. Most of what you need is in Vol. 2 of the basic manual.

Like Wayne of Sunnyvale points out, maybe you can just resurface them. In
that case just unbolt caliper, undo axle nut, clean grease (don't want
shavings in there), take it to a machine shop and have the rotors turned. Do
not remove rotors from hub, they turn it as an assembly. If rotors are too
badly worn down, past wear limit stamped on edge of rotor, only then do you
need new rotors.

Fred Hess says basically the same thing, send them out to have a shop press
the bearings in/out. And while you're in there...

>PS, Does anyone know what happened to Porschephiles??

It's been gone for almost 3 weeks. Apparently Stan's computer crashed. There
is no word on when or even if it will come back, so a few of us decided to
move on with our own list. We hope it continues to grow and offers new
features and goes into new territory which Porschephiles wasn't doing. We
hope you'll stay with us and pass the word.

Pete
