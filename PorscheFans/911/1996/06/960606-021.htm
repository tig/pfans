   Thank you to all the people who replied to my query about reproducing
Burgandy red. The car has been repainted in the original color and the paint is
in excellent condition. There is a scratch on the fender which needs retouching
and I have an "S" bumper I would like to install. It is the bumper I will have
to paint. Yes, I will be shooting it myself. I have found with a little
practice, the average gearhead can lay down an acceptable job on smaller items.
   New OSHA requirements go into effect in July. I would reccomend anyone who
wants to buy any painting materials should do so now. Many items will no longer
be available to the hobbiest if you cannot prove you have an OSHA approved paint
booth !
