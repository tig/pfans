I've been receiving mail from the list for about a week, now. I note that
a number of the participants are on services that charge $ for email. I
thought I'd share a treasure I stumbled across a couple of weeks ago.
It's called Juno, and is a completely COST FREE email service that
recently set up shop. I don't know how they do it-other than there are a
number of ads that appear on the software routinely--similar to Prodigy.
I requested their software, received same through the mail, answered a
number of consumer preference type questions, and commenced to send my
email. They have a number of local (cost free) phone numbers for access
or, if your area isn't represented, an 800 number. Their software
solicites new members and can be reached at Sign up@Juno,com. I have no
connection with this outfit--thought I'd share this info. So far this
service has handled the volume of the 911 list with no problems. I have
an '85 911 Targa,

Rich Brown
