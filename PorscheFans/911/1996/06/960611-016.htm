Well, here I am, stuck at the office with no throttle at all.  I can
think of millions of other places that I'd rather be stuck than here... 
I'm hoping that one of you out there can offer me some advice so I can
leave at the usual 5:00pm quitting time.  This is really a 914 question,
but I figure that the 911's have a similar configuration, so maybe one
of you can help out.  The throttle cable came loose from the throttle
body.  The screw/nut/combo thing that the cable passes through just came
loose, and when I hit the gas, the cable just pulled free.  When I let
up on the pedal, the cable sprung back towards the throttle body, and
took the cable sheath with it.  So, the black plastic cable sheath has
pulled off of it's little "nozzle" at the fire wall, and just kind of
rest against it now.  This in effect creates a larger cable sheath,
which in effect shortens the cable, and now I can't get the cable to
reach the throttle body without leaving the throttle half-open!  The
attachment at the fire wall appears to be a metal tube coming out of the
wall, with the wire passing on the inside of the tube, and the cable
ending with a metal wrap-around (can't think of a better word) that
slides over the metal tube in the wall.  I am of course stuck with the
lovely original Bilstein jack, so I can get under there, but I can't say
I feel all that safe pushing on the fire wall with the car in that
precarious position.  It almost seems as though the metal wrap-around
needs to be "loosened", but it doesn't appear that it can be.  Am I
missing something?  Any words of advice?  The real pisser is that I sent
away for my AAA Plus coverage YESTERDAY, so it'll be two more days until
I can collect...  so I beg of you... help me leave the office!

Thanks,

J.J. Slowik
