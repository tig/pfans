Hello Porsche Car Enthusiasts.

I would like to know if anyone can tell me if 930 cross drilled 
factory rotors would fit on a late 80's 911 Carrera? - I'm not
currently in the market for rotors, although, when I am, I would
like to go with cross drilled factories if possible.  I know various
outlets sell cross drilled after markets and will even drill your
current factory rotors.  Has anyone done this? I hear cross drilling
after market rotors actually can weaken them producing hairline fractures
from the drilling process? I've heard that the factory 930 rotors are
actually cast with the holes in them which apparently makes them stronger.

I don't use my car for anything other than pure enjoyment, and do not drive 
it hard at autocross or other comp. events.   Any input?

Also:  I have a 930 rear spoiler and I'm wondering how do I get the inside
of the
wing and deck lid clean? when you look into the black meshing the inner side is 
very dusty and oxidized as compared to my concours like finish...I'm not into
removing the wing or A/C condenser, is there a better way?

Joe
