Dave, are you sure you can blame this on the Red Line MTL?  Does your
tranny (forgot which you have) spec' a lightweight 75/80 fluid such as
the MTL, or does it require a 75/90?   

It's very ironic that you posted this message today - I was just putting an
order together to Imparts which included some Red Line MTL for the
tranny on my Alfa 164 (which actually spec's ATF, even though it's a 5
speed).  Now you've got me hesitating.   Incidently, Red Line specifically
states in their literature that manual transmissions which call for ATF
should use Red Line MTL.  

BTW, I do use Swepco in my 915 LSD transaxle and recommend it highly.

Good luck,

Brad
