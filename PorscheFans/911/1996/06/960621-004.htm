I used MTL in a 67 915 that had about 132K it when I was living in the Bay
Area. I happily jumped in the car and headed over the Santa Crux mountains
to the beach and about half way there the trans started to scream. It was
the worst damn trip to the beach! All the way home I listen to that sound
and started chacinging in my mind about the damage. 

I promtly drained the crap out and added Swepco to see if by chance the
damage was as bad as it sounded. The thing was like new! It shifted better
than it ever had and did so up until the day some bastard decided to borrow
the car from me one late night and not return it..... Moral of the
story.....I'll never use anything but Swepco in a Porsche trans. I also
won't take the advice of a certain Porsche parts reseller in Sunnyvale who
everyone probable has a catalog from who joyfully told me how great MTL was.
