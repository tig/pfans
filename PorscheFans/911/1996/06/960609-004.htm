Guys,

A few years ago, while racing POC, my main competition said that the reason I
was beating him was because I had ABS and that was cheating.  So, I Looked at
the legend inside the top of the fuse box, found out which fuse went to the
ABS
and pulled it.  We went back out and raced, I beat him again but it was much
closer.  He was/is right: ABS is a distinct advantage in any racing
enviroment from autocross to World Challenge.

Pulling the fuse did not affect anything else on the 1990 C2.  That said, it
would be very easy to hook a switch to that fuse BUT I do not understand why
anyone would ever (except, maybe, in the rain) want to disconnect the system
unless you enjoy losing, flat spotted tires, berms and guard rails.  Yes,
I've had
old time mechanics tell me about their doubts on ABS but the proof is on the
podium.  ABS allows you to stop in a shorter distance, to slow your car
quicker and to have control under braking.  Just after turn two at Mosport
you go down a steep hill, the middle third of the hill is off camber and you
are turning to the left.  With ABS you can finish you trail brake at that
point.  Without ABS, if you try this, you will blaze a trail directly to turn
5 without ever seeing turns 3 and 4.

So, my experience is that it's easy to disable the system by just pulling the
fuse.  But if you are going to do it, please do so just before you and I go
head to head on the track . . . I'll even help you find the correct fuse.

BTW - Thanks for the new list.  Being able to chose the model we are
interested in is wonderful.  And, now that we have the chance, does anyone
know any good 914 jokes (944s are too easy).  ;-{)

Monte
