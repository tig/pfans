        Seeing Mike's collection of T*d postings made me remember
a conversation I overheard at the Zone 7 AutoX School that T*d
attended.
        It was during a break, and several instructors were dis-
cussing their days activities and their students.
        Instructor X: "I had this one student who was a real nut.
Three different brands of tires on the car!  What a hoot!"
        Instructor Y (Soren, long-time Pfile): "Hmm, that sounds
familiar.  What was his name?"
        X: "It was Ted something-or-another."
        Y: "Right.  So, how was he?"
        X: "He was the most aggressive student I've ever had.
Also one of the very worst drivers."

        Nice to hear our opinions corroborated by an independant
authority...   8-)
