   Really don't know all the details of this. What I do know is that it has
something to do with releasing contaminants into the atmosphere. New paint booth
requirements will include scrubbers to remove solvents and other pollution from
air exhausted out of the booth. In addition, painters will now need a " space
suit " with an outside breathing source while working in the booth.
   Yeah, I don't like it either, but many of the new paints contain some pretty
nasty stuff, including cyanide. As to what paints will be available to the home
user, I'm not sure. Someone told me acrylic enamels would still be available,
but I haven't confirmed that.
