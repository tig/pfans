Hi All;

I have started entertaining the notion of replacing my '89 944 Turbo with a
911 (or variant thereof) possibly at the end of this track season.  I looked
at a '88 Carrera Targa but I find the interior to be a bit dated compared to
my 944.  The newer C2/C4 (964s?) look to be more to my liking.  I believe
the C4 came out in 1989 but the C2 started in 1990.  I am probably looking
at either '90 or '91 C2 for my budget.  Is there anything to watch out for
in the C2/C4 class that makes one model year better than another?  I heard
the early C4s had some problems with clutches or flywheels oe something like
that.  Is this true?  Anything else I should be aware of as I shop?  It may
be difficult to step down in horsepower, but I think I can make it up by
learning a new car to drive.  TIA.

Tracy Meyer
