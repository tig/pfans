We've been up for just under 3 weeks and the list is growing.

So far, we have the following:

356 list -- 46 members 
911 list -- 139 members
914 list -- 57
924etc list -- 64
928 list -- 54

I've gone through the names to look for cross-list duplication; how many
people want all of the lists anyway, how many are selective? I haven't gone
all the way through but it does appear that many members are making use of
the ability to pick which car platforms they prefer. Of those in my spot
check so far, about half subscribe to all five lists, the other half
cherrypicked, some as few as two lists, some up to four lists but not all
five (indicating that they think one of the five isn't a Porsche? Funny, it's
not always the same car in all cases!)

The list is growing and seems to be doing well. Tell a friend...
