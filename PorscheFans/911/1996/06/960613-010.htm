Hi Pfolks, 

I need some advice on shocks.  It's very confusing as to which years will 
interchange with my '74.  I have Boge struts in front w. fairly new Boge gas 
shocks in the rear.  After a couple of track events, the car dives and squats 
too much so I'm looking for stiffer shocks for track/autox use.  I have a used
set of rear Bilsteins (green) which I'm considering putting on.  Are these the
Sport Bilsteins?   However, they do not seem as stiff as the Boge on there now
(subjective opinion from compressing both by hand).  

What are the various sport shocks available in terms of varying degrees of 
stiffness?   Are the adjustable Konis the firmest for combined street/track 
use?  Other pertinent info:  the car is getting 22mm f/r Weltmeister swaybars 
soon and probably bigger torsion bars over the winter for next year so I'm 
looking for a stiff enough shock that I won't have to do this again.  BTW, can
I swap out the entire Boge strut for Koni or Bilstein struts or do I have to 
go with inserts?  I have a lead on almost new (1 race) Konis at half-price 
from a '73 911 so I'm wondering if they'll fit a '74.

Anyone used Boge Pro Gas or Turbo Gas on a 911?  I put the Turbo Gas on my 
Audi Turbo and they are much stiffer than the stock hydraulic Boge.  I know 
the Pro Gas is stiffer yet.  They are less expensive than Koni or Bilstein. 

If anyone has used struts/shocks for sale in excellent condition, I'd be 
interested.

Please cc directly to me, it takes a while for the digest to get here. 

Thanks for any advice,
