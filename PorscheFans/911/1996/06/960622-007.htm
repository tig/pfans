Hello PorscheFans,
	Thought I'd take a break from rebuilding my '69 911T brakes in 
my boiling garage shop.  I've been reading up on my partcular 911 and 
indeed it did have Webers as original.  It also is supposed to have a 
whopping 110 hp, ooooohh!  Can't imagine how slow that would be with the 
Sportomatic it originally came with, glad I have the '73 5-speed!  '69 
was also the first year for the Sporto and for the long wheelbase.  This 
engine must have S pistons/cylinders or something at rebuild, though the 
reciept doesn't say which ones he used.  The car feels very fast, but 
maybe the old Bursch muffler just made it sound fast.  Didn't the 914-6 
have a 2.0 Weber engine like mine?  Did they only have 110hp?
	By the end of this weekend I hope to complete the rebuild of 
both front calipers and the master cylinders and install the new brake 
lines and front rotors and pads as well, then I can finally drive it!!!  
All that will remain are the rear calipers and rotors, and I will find 
out what needs to be done there.  I only have about $300 spent on parts 
so far, not too bad, eh?  Next in line are new floorpans and front pan and 
new shocks.  
	Less exciting are the problems with my '88 944 which has been 
dead since Wednesday.  It turns over normally, but no attempt to start at 
all, not even a sputter!  I do have a spark at all four cylinders, so the 
problem is probably fuel related.  I guess the next step is to check the 
fuel pump.  Can the DME unit just quit like that and not send a signal to 
the fuel pump?  Usually stuff gradually goes wrong, this was an instant 
and total loss!  Any suggestion is appreciated, and thanks for putting up 
with my new 911 babble ;^)

Jay Karolyi
