Just finished the major tune up of the beastie, set the valves for the 
first time since Kremer did it....what a royal pain on both ends of the 
spinal cord....I would love to punch whoever designed those heads (and made 
them almost impossible to get a feeler guage into) in the nose...oh 
well...they were all on the tight side so loosened them a bit.

Two questions came up. First, I found one of my spark plug wires was a bit 
weak, seems like it is leaking a bit of the spark....hence I thought I 
would replace the whole set. Question is, how essential are those braided 
wires?? I would rather get a real good set of silicone wires and live with 
those, but what bad things happen to a CIS car when this is done. I have 
heard that you can thread new silicone into the braids, put on new ends and 
have a good result...anyone ever do this successfully and any tips you 
might have??

Second question involves driving. After the tune up, went for a test drive, 
 some nut case in a Camaro decided he would really like to see if two 
objects can occupy the same space at the same time...fortunately I hit the 
brakes and horn and we missed each other...but it seems like he did not 
hear my nicely rebuilt horns. They are not all that loud....any good ideas 
for how to make them MUCH louder and still keep the same (more or less 
stock) set up?? Actually mine are more like an enraged squeak than a 
honk...is there anything wrong or are all 911's aurally challenged....

Any help/advice...thanks very much!!
