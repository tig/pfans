Greetings P-nuts,

For those of you who subscribe to multiple P-Fans lists, I sincerely
apologize for the cross-posting...I'm trying to hit the broadest audience
here.

Also, those of you who live EAST of the rockies can probably shitcan this
post...now.

HELP WANTED...

You see, I am looking for a volunteer who will help,(or simply take over),
with updating the Pacific Coast Track Activities Page that is hosted on the
Sacramento Valley PCA homepage.  I (along with Mike Willis) started the
whole thing last winter, but I only got listings up as far as April.  I am
trying to start a new freelance business, and I don't have a helluva lot of
time to properly maintain this page.

I feel that this cross indexing of events all through this region (Wash,
Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and, of course, the people's republic
of California...) is a semi-valuable tool as there is so much track
activity going on all year round in some places.  Hank Watts has done a
nice calendar that covers Northern CA, along with some major stuff (CART,
F1, Nascar etc) thrown in...I basically expanded this idea.

I hate to see it die simply because I can't properly feed and care for
it...Any takers out there? I will send you all my stuff and provide
whatever phone/email support is necessary to work this thing.  I just don't
feel I should be leading...I'll be more than happy to help someone else
with this.

I hope to hear from somebody soon...

Cheers
Thom Kuby
