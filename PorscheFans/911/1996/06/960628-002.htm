Scott says

>What probably happened is the ball&socket joint under the pedal board popped
apart.  There are two (main) causes for this:

>1) Your pedal stop broke (or in my case, non-existant) and you accidently
over extended the pedal, then the accelerator lever and popped the joint, or

>2) The accelerator lever broke and allowed you to drop the pedal to the
floor.

>I suffered from all of the above.

>If your lucky, the socket just popped apart.  just feel around behind the
gas pedal for the lever, pull it forward and snap the socket (of the push
rod) back on to the ball of the lever...


I've had this happen on mid-80s 911s. Sometimes you have to hold the rod
coming up out of the floor with some vise-grips as you pop the ball end back
into the pedal. 

As I recall, I've also had the other end of this rod come off the bellcrank
under the floor. I've been able to pry it back onto its ball without removing
the floorboard, by using a big screwdriver.
