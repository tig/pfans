Regarding stitching a 911 steering wheel, Tom Smith said: 

>The whole proceedure was one of the most boring things I have ever done.  

>The wheel is rather awkward to work on, and since it is black it can be a
bit hard to see what you are doing. I for one will >never do another one, I
will pay to have someone else do it and consider it a bargain at twice the
price.

Tom is a master of understatement.  I replaced my cover with a kit from Alan
Gunn Leather products. I removed the wheel from my car, and fastened it to
my bench vise with a long 1/2" bolt.  Gunn gives you two needles, and a ton
of black thread, but it's BOOORRIIING, and really tough on your fingers.  If
you have any sense of esthetic, getting a nice job will drive you crazy.  

I'd gladly take on just about any other job on my car rather than do another
one ... the only thing worse I can think of would be to have to stitch the
wheel while it was still on the car.
....Gregg
