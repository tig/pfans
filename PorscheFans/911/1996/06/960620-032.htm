Resurfacing the flywheel is probably not a bad thing, but it's also not
generally necessary.  I'd check it for surface condition and smoothness.
If it's not deeply gouged or cracked, your OK.  Balancing, or at least
checking the balance, is certainly nice too.

If you do resurface, be sure to check for minimum thickness, which is called
out in the spec booklettes.

The flywheel bolts can be reused so long as they're not damaged.  Especially
check that the heads are OK, not munged by a slip of the ol' triple-square
bit.  Use a dab of red Loctite on the thread before re-installing.  For
extra points, measure each bolt's length with a calliper and toss any
which are significantly longer than their brethern -- they've been over-
tightened and stretched.  Ditto for the pressure plate bolts.

Just my opinion; there's personal judgement here and others certainly have
different opinions on these points.
