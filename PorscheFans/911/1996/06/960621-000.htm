[NOTE: I'm sending this message to the 911 guys as well since the
problem has evolved into a general air-cooled engine prob.]

Thanks to everyone who has helped me so far.  I've decided that no
matter what, I will get this car running like it should, and keep it
that way for many years...  it's just too much fun!

Yesterday, I asked for help regarding a noise in my valve train.  I've
got new information.  I talked my girlfriend into coming outside and
"helping" me do my valve adjustment, and boy am I glad I did!  During
the rebuild, I picked up a nice set of angled feeler gauges to use on
the valve adjustment.  We used .020 for the exhaust, and .015 for the
intake.  She kindly pointed out that what we were using was WAY wrong. 
We should have been using .20mm and .15mm, but we had been using .020in
and .015in!  Needless to say, the initial valve adjustment was made WAY
too loose, and thus explained the noisy valves.  So, I crawled under the
car, spun the engine to #1 TDC, and popped the valve cover off...
nothing.  There was no broken rocker arms, no loose nuts, nothing!  I
adjusted the valves, following the steps in the Haynes manual, and moved
to the other side.  Same thing there.  Once I had the valves adjusted, I
took a deep breath, and fired it up.  The noise was back!  As you may
recall from yesterday, there was a noise at idle, and once the car had
run for about 2 mins, it went away.  The same thing happened.  I was
able to definitely isolate it to the driver's side, and if you get down
on your knees as listen, it sounds really bad.  It a LOUD banging noise,
metal on metal, that just makes you think something REALLY bad is
happening.  Curious as to how the engine was running, I gave it a little
gas.  It appears to rev just fine, and at higher (~2500)rpms, the engine
drowns out the banging noise.  Returning to idle, the noise is still
there... for about 1 minute, and then it's gone!  I gave it gas at this
point, and it appeared to rev just fine, and the noise didn't come back.

So, can anyone give me any direction here?  What would cause very little
(or none at all) power loss, produce a *banging* noise at idle when
cold, and go away after about a minute?  I don't even know what else to
check...

I have assumed that this problem is unrelated to the other problems I'm
having, but just in case, I'll cover those two.  If you think that these
two might be related to the one above, let me know...

1.)  When maintaining a steady highway speed with my foot just barely on
the accelerator, the car occasionally "jerks".  I have assumed that this
is the Throttle Valve Switch, and have a new one on order.

2.)  The car backfires terribly.  After adjusting and checking the
timing MANY times at my local shop, checking the plugs, wires, and
injectors, we have decided that it's an exhaust leak.  When I rebuilt
the top end, we were unable to get three of the four copper gaskets
(between the head and the headers) out of the head.  I put a new one in
where we got the old one out, and bolted everything on.  Now I'm
thinking that those old gaskets just aren't sealing like they should. 
Can anyone see a problem with "doubling-up" the copper gaskets?  I can't
get the old ones out, but I've got new ones that I can put over them...

Well, I think that should about cover it.  I plan on having this car
running like a champ by the end of the weekend, and keeping it that way.
 Help me with my mission! (Please!)

Thanks again (and again and again)!
