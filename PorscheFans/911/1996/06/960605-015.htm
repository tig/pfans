(from memory...what left of it:-)

(drain oil...remove  battery ground strap<grin>)=20
#1 Remove Muffler
#2 Remove bolts securing the rear shrouding.
#3 Remove shrouding (pulls tward the rear of the car)
#4 Remove Cam housing  covers. (1/2  are  above the shroud 1/2  are above..
1  cover per side)
#5 inspect...

(above assumes you don't have AC.)

If ya have AC.. remove the  compessor from  bracket then remove bracket
after  you  have removed the shrouding.. depending on how the  stateside
instalation was done.

Tensioner gaurds are about the size of a dollar coin. They are strapped=
 around
the tensioner  with  2 screws.  They eliminate total  failure of the=
 tesnioner.
In the avent of a failure the tensioner (in essance)becomes a solid=
 tensioner.

You  are not going to change the relationship of the chains to the
sprockets. The guards go over sprung part of the tensioner arm. The part the
pushes on the
idler sprocket (for lack of better term)

I have seen a used cold tensioner at a lower than acceptable level. When I
touched it, it came up. Don't know why and was pretty unconfortable with it.
