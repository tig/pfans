          SUBJECT:   RE: MFI Pump Hoses
 
 
Steve,
 
The inner hose that attaches to the MFI pump from the left engine sheet
metal (the smaller of the two), is used by the pump to adjust the
leaness/richness of the pump.  When cold, more fuel, when warm less, since
the MFI systems run very rich, this hose is the most important.  The other
hose, which is larger is for the air intake.  On my '72T I have removed this
hose, since the SSI heat exchanger does not have a flange to mount the hose.
I read on the list previously, that if you do not have this flange then you
should not run the hose, since you will suck up road dirt.  Also, I have
removed the $45 cone shaped hose that runs from the cold/warm air flap to
the air cleaner.  I figure this will help to suck in more air and lean out
my rich MFI system some.
 
Can someone foreward to me the current status of Porschephiles?
