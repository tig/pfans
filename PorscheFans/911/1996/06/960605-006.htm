Hi, Bob.

>If you want it, I'll try and get a photocopy from the dealer. I know 
>you are fluent in German, how about French? 

Thanks for the offer. I can puzzle out French if need be, but I don't need
the article.

>I trail braked to set the car up in a slight oversteer attitude and
>still found no evidence of tail wagging.  If anything, transfer of
>power to the front of the car might have a tendency to allow the car
>to pull itself out of the potential spin.  

The C4s and Turbos have ABD, Automatic Brake Differential, to avoid wheelspin
and stabilize the car at lower speeds. It doesn't work above 44 mph. ABD
applies brakes to one or both spinning rear wheels if the conventional
limited slip differential can't control it any more. to the front wheels.

> I'll have more to say after driving 
them both. They'll both have the same size and brand tires too, Toyo 
RA-1 235 F and 255R.  I bet the 993 can go deeper because it (now) has 
a "racier" suspension setup than the C4. 

That should be an interesting back-to-back comparison. 

>BTW if you have any good ideas on how to turn of ABS on these cars, 
I'd like to know. 

How about finding the fuse that controls power to the ABS brain box? Is
anything else on that fuse?

>Threshold braking on bumps sucks with ABS too.

Yup. They all do that. ABS was never designed with bumps in mind. It confuses
the system.

Audi is as far as I know the only carmaker to give you an ABS on/off switch.

>Lastly, I assume you have something to do with PorscheFans being up. 
Thanks! I'm sorry to see the 'philes gone but I was getting tired of 
seeing screen after screen of profane attempts to get Stan's 
attention.

Yup again. A friend named Jim Bergman and I are using some overhead on his
system, with a T1 line and the whole 9 yards. Hope this list survives.

Pete
