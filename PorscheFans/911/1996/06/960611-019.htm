Hello,

I read with interest Fred Hess's re-counting of the torque wrench
info from Raceware.

IMHO, buy and use whatever type of torque wrench you like.  The
sole purpose of "torquing" a fastener is to create an axial load in
the fastener to apply a "clamping" force to a joint.  We generally
do this by torquing the nut, etc., due to lack of a better, more accurate
method.  Truth is, torquing is a very *inaccurate* means to create
precisely the correct axial load in the fastener.  There are literally
about a hundred different variables that can affect the axial load
in a fastener during torquing.

Bottom line, I wouldn't worry a heck of a lot about the accuracy of
your torque wrench - the most accurate torque wrench in the world
still results in widely scattered axial loads.  In fact, we use ultra-
sonic devices in the aerospace industry when "pre-loading" fasteners.
These devices actually measure the change in length of the
fastener during torquing - a guaranteed measure of the correct
axial load.
