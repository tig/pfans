Just took my 911 out for one of its longer drives (it only has about 1000km on it at 
this point). I haven't driven a 911 for 10 years (the time it took to get it all 
together), so I am not sure what is normal.

It seems like there is a large amount of wind noise coming from around thelower 
corners of the windshield. I have all of the new seals on the car, including the little 
plastic wedges which are supposed to help the noise. It is almost a whistling in 
nature, and is lound enough to make listening to the stereo almost pointless....not 
that I'd want to, but the wife likes music.

Is there any chance that the windshield rubber is letting air through?? I did not use 
any sealing compound on it....does it leak air if I don't?? Any other ideas??

BTW I have the "paddle" style mirrors...any potential for noise out of those 
puppies???

Thanks to all!!
