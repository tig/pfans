The hard lines use the same mounting as the rocker panel "covers" (the 
parts visible from the outside). Basically there is a nylon spacer washer 
about 1/2 inch thick if you don't have oil lines, and the thinner ones 
(about 1/8 inch) if you do. The split rubber sleeves are used to protect 
the oil lines themselves from clamping pressures and potential wear from 
vibration...as they are brass if they are real Porsche.
At the rear, there should be a stud on the inner right side fender 
(threaded...8mm if I recall) which has a similar "W" type bracket which 
holds the oil lines in the rear fender area. 

You should have 4 "W" clamps (3 on the rocker and 1 in the rear fender 
well). As for the hose clamps, I suspect they hold the oil lines in the 
front fender well. There are 3 (again if I recall correctly) captive nuts 
in the fender well, they will have a bolt in them as a filler, remove the 
existing bolt, and use a replacement (as it is probably all munged up) and 
use it to retain the lines there. Note that the fit is very precise, and 
there is not a lot of room to wiggle things....


Also note that the finish on the lines is (or at least was on mine) 
absolute crap. They appear to have used the cheapest laquer known to 
man....I stripped them down using laquer thinner and refinished them in 
proper epoxy.....

Let me know if you have any further questions.....BTDT
