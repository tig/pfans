I'm not sure but I think I ran the last of the round-the-country One Laps in
1989. Maybe they did one more long one after that. I was part of a
two-vehicle team driving Lamborghini LM002 trucks. We both finished. I
learned some useful things. 1) You can cook a can of Hormel chili on the top
of the engine between fuel stops. Remember to punch vent hole in can and
clean underside of hood before returning vehicle. 2) You can experience the
feeling of finishing the One Lap without leaving home. You do this by
deciding not to enter. The feeling of relief that comes over you is just like
the feeling you get when you realize it's over. <g> Like war, it's memorable
but not necessarily something you want to put yourself through again. 

We spent 10 days on the road, only one night in a hotel, covered 10,000 miles
and were always just minutes ahead of missing our scheduled time window into
checkpoints. The Lamborghini allowed the guy in back to stretch out and sleep
on the bench seat, but the guy in the passenger seat had to sleep sitting
bolt upright because Lambo put the air conditioning unit where you would like
to put your feet. So you sat like in a church pew or at mess at a military
academy.
