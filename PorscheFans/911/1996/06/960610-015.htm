Thanks for all the advice re: running hot and the source of the oil in my air 
cleaner housing.  Just to clarify: this was a very hot day (90^+) with engine 
idling while waiting in line for my runs.  Typical runs were under a minute.  
I'd think it's ok to peak at 250^ for just a minute.  Subsequently, I've run 
my car at Pocono Raceway and only saw temps go up to 210 on a cooler day.  
Other advice I got at the track was to fabricate a quick-disconnect for the 
right front parking light/lens assembly which will flow more air to the 
cooler.  I've also seen guys remove the right headlight and drill holes in the
headlight bucket but I think I'll try removing the parking light first.
