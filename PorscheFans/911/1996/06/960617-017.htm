 Greetings,
 Does anybody have experience with fixing really damaged threads ?

 The intercooler on my '82 930 mounts on to the popoff valve housing
 with 2 big bolts. When I got my car, both holes had helicoils
 installed and also had small cracks around the mounting bosses.

 A few days ago I noticed that the mounting boss broke, the bolt is
 now hanging in the air. and I no longer have a good seal on the
 pressure pipe. (It even spit out half of the rubber O-ring)

 First of all I am curious if other 930 owners have trouble keeping
 their intercooler mounted securely, or if it is only mine that somehow
 wants to break loose. I can't imagine that the turbo boost pressure
 would be responsible. The only reason I can think of is that the other
 mounting location (the bracket for the fan housing) somehow shifts in
 relation to the popoff valve at high temperatures.

 But now to the most important question: Does it make sense to try to
 weld the mounting boss, essentially adding lots of aluminum, and then
 cutting fresh threads ? Or should I look for a new (used) popoff valve
 housing ? Do aftermarket intercoolers come with popoff valves ?

 Also, this brings up another question that I was always wondering
 about: What is a long-neck intercooler ? I read somewhere that such
 an intercooler blocks off the popoff valve. How would this work ?

 My understanding is that the popoff valve is responsible for diverting
 the high pressure air when you are running at high boost conditions
 and suddenly slam the throttle shut. I would guess that something
 would blow up or that you might bend the throttle butterfly if you
 don't have the popoff valve.

 If you have any information about this, would you please mail me
 directly to khorram@pixelmagic.com. I am receiving porschephiles
 on another account but I have a mountain of unread digests to wade
 through.

 Thanks, Ray Khorram
