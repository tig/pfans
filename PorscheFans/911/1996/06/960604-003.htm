Last time I did my brakes, I removed all 4 discs and had them resurfaced.
Then reinstalled them with new pads all around.  That was on an '87 911,
and although there may be some differences, they're probably not significant.
So, I think I can safely say that you don't need any special tools or
expertise.

I currently live in Sunnyvale, so if you want some back-seat/over-the-shoulder
mechaniking, let me know.  But, I'm sure you can do it yourself.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
'87 911 Targa
