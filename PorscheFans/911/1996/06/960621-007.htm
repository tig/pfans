First a reply to Mark Gillis about 92 octane and ethanol.  I can't say if   
a 69 911s will act the same way as my 912 but the conditions are similar.   
 The 69 912 (and 911s I would imagine) came from the factory for   
California Emissions as lean as would allow them to run.  Many 912s   
suffered cracked heads because of the over heating they took.  Now for   
the Ethanol, any alcohol added to a fuel will increase octane BUT alcohol   
has 1/2 the BTU's!  So you are in effect leaning it out even more!  I had   
to re-jet the 912 to get it to run on 94octane 25%alcohol.

And now the Tomato!

Hey why are we dragging 912's into this tomato war!  Us 912 owners were   
just sitting back listening and sniggering as you muscle car   
owners(MUSCLE CAR: any car with a displacement over 1600cc having   
difficulty driving in anything but a straight line) stained each other   
red!

Well the virtual gauntlet has been thrown!

I hope this joke doesn't get me into trouble, please be warned it is of a   
filthy nature and apologies to those of you who have heard it before:

One day an Elephant was walking through the jungle and fell into a   
covered pit left but a poacher.  Help Help he cried.  A Mouse that was   
near by came running up.  Please help me out of this pit! the Elephant   
cried.  The Mouse said "Don't worry I'll get you out of there!".  The   
Mouse ran off and a few minutes later drove up in a 911.  He threw a rope   
to the Elephant and pull him out of the pit with the 911.  Oh Thank You   
Mr Mouse!, the Elephant said, "I am forever in your debt.

Some days later the Mouse was driving his 911 through the jungle and   
drove right into the same pit he had saved the Elephant from.  Help Help   
he cried.  The Elephant heard the Mouse and came running.  I'll save you   
Mr Mouse!  The Elephant lowered his Penis into the pit, hooked onto the   
911 and pulled the car and the Mouse to safety.

The moral of this story?

If you have a big enough Penis you don't need a 911!
