I received the following flyer from Raceware when I purchased rod bolts
from them.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING TORQUE WRENCHES AND TIGHTENING TORQUES
 The purpose of a torque wrench is to allow you to PROPERLY tension a fastener.
There are three basic styles of torque wrenches, the beam, the dial and
"clicker" The  beam  style has been with us for many years and has a pointer
than moves along a scale as  you apply force to the wrench handle.  The dial
torque wrench works on the principle of hydraulics and has a gauge that
indicates the force  applied. The "clicker" style torque wrench is perhaps
the most common torque wrench in use today because of its convenience and
mass marketing. The "clicker" style uses a spring as a reference to
determine a given force. When used properly all three styles of torque
wrenches can be effective.

 The BEAM STYLE torque wrench rarely goes "out of calibration" because it
has no moving parts, or only one if you consider the pointer. Unless the
beam  style
wrench is subjected to  abuse, it's accuracy stays pretty  consistent over
it's lifespan, which is probably forever. These wrenches are  generally
available with accuracy ratings of 5% or possibly 2%. This is acceptable for
most applications.

 The  DIAL style gauge as more moving parts and the potential for easy
damage if not carefully  handled and maintained. All gauges have variations
in accuracy over their operating range.  Good quality dial  style torque
wrenches can be very accurate, but should periodically be checked for
calibration. This should be  accomplished by a reputable, skilled instrument
shop NOT by comparison  to another torque wrench, which could also be out of
calibration.

 "CLICKER" style torque wrenches were originally intended for use where the
ability to read a gauge or scale was physically impossible. Unfortunately
some wise marketer decided that the  "clicker"  style wrench would be ideal
for those who do not know how to use  a wrench properly..and now EVERYBODY
it seems owns one of these devices. We would  STRONGLY recommend  that you
carefully read what we have to say about  ALL "clicker" style torque
wrenches before using it to install any important threaded fastener.  Brand
and model have  NO effect on the accuracy of a "clicker" wrench.

 "Clicker" style wrenches use a spring, (and  additional mechanisms) to
create force for the wrench to match when you apply force to the handle.
When you exceed the setting torque,  the wrench clicks indicating you have
reached or exceeded the force required. This technique creates a lit of
potential for error. Fist, you are using a spring to set the force and all
springs  change their rate over time and use.  Second, once you exceed the
balancing force, and the wrench clicks, you can still apply an unknown
additional force.

  We have seen "clicker" style torque wrenches that were out of calibration
as much as 50%. That is NOT a misprint, we said 50%. These wrenches were top
quality wrenches that were NOT subjected to abuse. Some had been calibrated
within a years time, by competent labs. We strongly suggest that if you
choose to use a "clicker" style torque wrench, WHICH WE DO NOT RECOMMEND,
that you have it calibrated REGULARLY, and ALWAYS BEFORE INSTALLING
IMPORTANT FASTENERS.
The use of socket drive extensions is NOT recommended because they cause
errors in torque readings.
