I have a set of SS lines ordered, which should be arriving here by the weekend.
I guess that big qualm people have with them is that there are no warning
signs before a line fails.  And from previous discussions, it sounds like a
lot of the cause of failure is dirt that works it's way under the braid, and
ends up chafing the teflon liner, causing it to rupture (another big cause was
crimping/crushing the line, causing the liner to get cut).

Well, my little brain had a flash.  Why not get some plastic tubing, slip it
over the SS line, and seal it at the ends?  This would keep the dirt from
getting in, and hopefully prolong the life of the lines.  An even cleaner
approach would be to just slip some heat-shrink tubing over the length of the
line....

Any comments about the utility of this exercise?

Mike
