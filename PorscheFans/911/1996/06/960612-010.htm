Tom, 

I am using the ignition system only,  and have only had the car running for
about
two weeks now.  Haven't done the "track test" yet.  But from the seat of the
pants I think the engine is running better.  The ability to program your own
advance curve is a real nice advantage, and based on looking at the plugs it
seems to run cleaner.  This is probably due to the dual spark system (fires
on
intake and exhaust).  Also, the most amazing thing is when you adjust the
timing,  you put the timing light on the pulley and it looks absolutely
still.
None of that bouncing around stuff you see with the distributor. The motor
revs beautifully & pulls smoothly right up to the redline, no breaking up 
or stumbles etc.  In the words of Ferris Beuler " if you have the means I 
highly recommend picking one up!"

Thkx,
