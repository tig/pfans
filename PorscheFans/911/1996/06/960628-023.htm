Do you have the fuchs rims? and why kind of tires? -I think the 245 would look
wider on a 9" rim than squeezed onto an 8"...any input?

A few...no kidding! - thats great though, precision and 'helpfulness'

Nope, didn't even know about it...would have like to have attended that...
not really a vintage guy though...but I do like older 911s...356s well they
are pretty cool to come to think of it.
