Hi folks,

Managed to do some more damage on my 914 again last night.... =8^)  I dropped
by the local import parts place and got a set of inner wheel seals for the 911
hubs, after my dealer said they were out.  Then I went home and took a drift
and hammer to the inner race of the inner bearing.  Tap, tap, tap, and out
came the old seals.  I didn't touch the rubber ring at all, so I guess it's in
no worse shape than original.  Just the same, I had already bought new ones,
so those will go in, and I'll keep the original ones for spares.  The bearings
themselves seem fine, as I only hammered on the edges of the race, and not
hard at that.  Everything's soaking in solvent for now, at any rate.  I guess
you don't really need that fancy Snap-On seal puller (which sorta looks like
a gaffing rod, btw) or an oven (per the Haynes manual).... =8^)

I also managed to loosen the nut that holds the front strut insert to the
upper strut mount.  Just turning the nut will spin both it and the keyed
washer.  What I used to hold the washer in place was the shock preload
adjusting wrench from one of my motorcycle tool kits.  It looks like a
C-spanner, but has the added benefit of a cylindrical "wall" section, which
helps keep it in place on the strut body.  I think what also helped was that
the strut was still in the car; the spare unmounted old one I first practiced
on could not be kept still when torque was applied.  This is probably all moot
for those with impact tools though.

I'm putting in an order to Automotion for some misc pieces, and am really
tempted to get a set of Weltmeister bushings, since I'm well into the front of
the car.  Could those who have put in A-arm bushings comment on how difficult
it is to remove the old rubber bushings and install the new ones, and how you
did it?  Also how much of a difference there is between the street and regular
compounds?  I'd really appreciate it.

I also think my Koni's are in need of a rebuild.  Certainly the rear shocks
are, though I think the fronts may be okay.  I've tried Koni's tech line, but
all I get is an answering machine.  Is there a way to test them, and who might
be able to rebuild them if they need it?  There shouldn't be that much to
rebuilding one other than fluid and new seals; new ones seem to go for around
~$100 a piece...


Thanks in advance, my project list for the weekend is filling up!
Mike

P.S.  Are the various short-shift kits any good/worthwhile for a 901 sideshift
tranny in a 914?  The tranny currently works well, but 1st is balky, and it's
pretty easy to nick reverse going to second.  I already have the bushing set
from AAtlanta, but won't be putting that in until I get around to the engine
transplant....
