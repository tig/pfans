        Well, I just got back from a visit with Tony, my mechanic.
I learned several things:
        1) It's a damn good thing that I decided to get the tranny
overhauled this month!  It looks like it wasn't far from blowing
itself up in a really spectacular, messy, and expensive way.
        2) I will never, ever, ever, EVER use Red Line MTL again!
The stuff that came out (1 month and about 350 miles on it!) was
just *full* of metal.  The previous batch had been in for about 2
years and 5K miles.
        Tony's replacing things in this tranny that he's *never*
had to replace before (except when the tranny really blew up).
Things like the spider gears in the differential.  I saw, they did
look ugly; definite wear on them, plus pitting on a number of teeth.
Yuck.
        Tony says "use Swepco."  I am now a believer!
        3) Everything on this car *was* in worse shape than it
seemed.  With this overhaul, the entire powertrain will have been
"done"...  And this from a car that seemed to be one of the "good
ones" when I bought it.  Oh well, you can't always tell from the
outside!
