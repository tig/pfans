There is a very good reason, and may actually SAVE you money!

You will need to re-index your torsion bars several (dozen?) times
to do the weight balancing. The sway-away spring plates
have a removeable adjuster end that will come off the end of the
torsion bar for re-indexing without removing the whole
spring plate from the suspension. Bad explanation, but it
takes a long time on the stock ones and a few minutes with
the sway away. I was even able to re-index the bars without
removing the wheel.

Since time is money, it will be much cheaper to buy them
now.

P.S. I have an article on 911 alignment on my FTP site at :

ftp://users.aol.com:/AnalogMike/align.txt or align.ltr?
