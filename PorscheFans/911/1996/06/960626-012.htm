Hi gang,

I know we've been over this, but it didn't apply to me before.

I need to know the safe range for oil temps.  It seems that
someone quoted Bruce with a spread of temps than went from
"ok" to "too damn hot".  Does anyone have that range handy?

The car used to have a 2.2T which never budged from 180.

My car now  has a 3.2CIS motor and a stock SC oil cooler.
Temps range from 180-210 with normal driving and 230 on
hot days.  My car has not seen the track (yet)
but sees all manner of everyday driving from SF hills
to stop and go on 101 to high speed 1-5 runs.  I have not
yet done a sustained high speed run so I don't know
what to expect there.

The sales guy at Turbotronics said the temps I am seeing are not
a cause for concern.  Of course a guy at Powerhaus rolled his eyes
so severely I could sense it over the phone. He insinuated the car
would hit critical mass if I did not upgrade immediately to the
set-up _racers_ use... (behind the valence, ram air, etc.).

Opinions appreciated.
