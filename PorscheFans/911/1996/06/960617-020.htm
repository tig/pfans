Hello Porschepholks,
	Well, I finally took the plunge and bought my first 911!  I'll 
try not to go into too much detail about it, but I am kind of excited 
about it since I've been wanting one since I knew what a car was.
	It's a 1969 911T Sunroof coupe, original fuchs wheels, and, yes, 
factory sport seats!  Spotted this ad in the paper early Saturday morning 
which just said "69 911T, runs great, needs work, $2000 firm".  My brother 
and I hopped in his 914 and checked it out expecting the worst.  
	The guy has owned it for about eight years and his father owned it 
since 1973.  It has spent most of its life in Michigan (ick!) so it has 
its share of rust.  The floorpans are rusted through in a couple spots 
and the front pan has been amaturishly patched at the suspension mounts.  
No body rust through though, and no accidents from what my brother could 
see.  It was originally bright orange (blutorange?), but he had it 
repainted white when he acquired it, and that paint is very tired.  I 
want to paint it back to orange anyway!  
	He had the engine rebuilt five years and 22,000 miles ago, and 
had a 5-speed with short shift from a '73 installed (was originally a  
Sportomatic) at that time.  Receipts show new piston/cylinders and 
head work and new tensioners (but not Carrera) and usual rebuild stuff.  
Has Weber carburetors which were rebuilt at "some time". He insists they  
are original, but weren't 911s mechanically fuel injected from '69?   
Probably has a conversion kit. This engine runs like a dream and is the  
smoothest 911 engine I've ever heard!  What a bark!  Not quite as fast as 
that '73 911T 2.7 I considered but much faster than that worn out '72  
911E.  No smoke whatsoever, even at startup!  With such a strong engine,  
factory sport seats, and nice fuchs wheels for $2000, how can I go wrong?
I gave him $100 then and $1900 today.  I own a 911!!!
	The car has been sitting outside under a tarp for the past year 
or so and the tires are dry rotted and the interior smells awful (mold on 
the carpet! :^)  The reason the owner parked it (and is selling it) is 
because the brakes need a total overhaul, as in master cylinder, 
lines, caliper rebuild, rotors...everything!  The brakes are horrible, 
but the emergency brake works nicely at least on the nearly abandoned 
back roads we drove on :^)  How much work/money am I looking at for a 
brake overhaul?  
	I know its not the best thing to try and restore a beater 911, 
but I always need a project and the car isn't THAT far gone.  I 
can't wait to redo the brakes and get it on the road!  Then for the 
rust repair, paint job, interior work....God I love Porsches.
