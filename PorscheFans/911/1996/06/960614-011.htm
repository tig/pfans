I think the way it happened was that he had stopped to put some air in
one of his tires (slow leak I guess from curbsurfing), he left the engine
running and locked the door.  He called his girlfriend to bring the extra
set of keys, but she showed up about a half an hour later saying she
couldn't find them.  Ted then calls a locksmith who breaks the windshield
trying to "jimmy" the lock.  After about 45 minutes (remember the engine
is running the whole time) they realize that the window is open a few
inches and his girlfriend reaches in and unlocks the door.

Ted then tries to sue the locksmith for a new windshield.

Thanks for Mike Piera for bringing back memories...
