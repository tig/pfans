RIght on both counts. Even the factory ones develop radial fractures over
time (look at any Turbo with some miles on it and you'll see little cracks
extending outward and inward). The factory has an acceptable length for these
cracks, I think 1/4" or so.

If you don't have any brake problems and don't put the car on the race track,
why bother? It may look cool but does absolutely nothing for your braking
performance on the street. You can't get the brakes hot enough on the street
to need the racing benefits of cross drilling (cooling, get rid of pad gases,
etc). They will also wear your pads faster, kind of like a cheese grater.
