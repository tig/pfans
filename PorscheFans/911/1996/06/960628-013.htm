All youse P-car fanatics that knew me from P-Philes - Salutations! All
others - greetings!

<sheepish g> I just *paid* for some work to be done on the Orange Monster
and am feeling a little used and abused. . . Makes me want to impart of my
vast ;-) knowledge.

What's the deal with heat exchangers? as Wade Guthrie asks ...

Since they're at the bottom of the motor, they tend to get their share of
rough treatment, water and salt damage. The bane of early Porsches is rust
eats steel. The heat exchangers probably need replacing once in a P-car's
lifetime, unless you drive in the more extreme weather of the Northeast,
Canada, Alaska, Chile, New Zealand - etc. Mine had large holes and is a CA
car! There were many threads on winter storage, seemingly because the Rust
Monster eats your baby when you most expect it.

The replacement stainless steel (not as rust prone) exchangers are pieces
of art. If I didn't have to put them on the car, they'd be on my mantel -
if I had one. And what a wonder to open the heater and not have billows of
smoke and yukky <- technical term) air to breathe. Just think of how the
car was breathing! sucking up its own spew blowing back up into the carbs.

For reasonable quotes on replacements, call GPR @ 805.549.8525 - those with
resale #s can call factory-direct, Stainless Systems 800.227.1486.

BTW - German Parts and Restoration (and me with no vested interest) can be
_much_ less on parts quotes than Automotion, without going to used parts.

My $0.02 FWIW

PS - Thanks Pete for offering yet another venue for P-car enthusiasts.
