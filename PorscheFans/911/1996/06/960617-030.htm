Hi Dennis,

As the stigmata-like effect on my hands, there where I pressed the 
wrenches into them to tighten the clamp (roughly 20 some times), is 
wearing off, I am gaining the energy necessary to have another go at it. 
I've decided to also dismantle the shifter housing and replace whatever 
bushing is in there. Problem is that I am leaving for Europe in about 
four days, and as such am running out of time. Might have to resume this 
upon return...maybe it'll fix itself during those six weeks! Thanks for 
the additional advice. Here the "plan de campagne" when I return:

	1)dismantle shifter housing
	2)install short shift kit
	3)replace all bushings
	4)fill tranny with Swepco
	5)hope for the best

I'll keep you posted on the progress and the eventual results!
Thanks,
Geert

P.S. What is the story with the 3.2 Kremer? What exactely is it, what are 
the specs?_
