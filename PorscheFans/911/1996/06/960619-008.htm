> Whats the story on SLICK 50?

Two words, Joe:  Snake oil.

A whole bunch of words:

1.  Despite Petrolon/Quaker State's protestations, the independent
studies performed back in the early 90s (including Briggs and
Stratton's test that showed MORE wear with Slick 50) still haven't
been refuted.

2.  In 1992, the National Advertising Council of the Better Business
Bureau asked Petrolon (the manufacturer of Slick 50) to stop claiming
improvements in performance and fuel economy, since there was no
evidence to support those claims.  Petrolon agreed, and the BBB still
hasn't changed its mind about this.

3.  DuPont, where Teflon was invented, is apparently so hurt by
military cutbacks that it's stooped to running ads on network TV
promoting its products.  Even so, it STILL discourages Teflon's use as
a motor-oil additive.

4.  Even if you believe Petrolon's own studies, they only show
improvements in engine parts subjected to BOUNDARY lubrication (that
is, true metal-to-metal contact); most "metal-to-metal" contact in an
engine occurs under fully hydrodynamic conditions (that is, the metal
parts don't actually touch each other at all; there's a film of oil
between them).

In fact, when you look at the SAE papers submitted by Petrolon for
peer review, you find that the product ONLY bonds to metal parts that
are subjected to EXTENSIVE boundary-lubrication conditions.  That is,
even though many engine parts DO work under boundary-lube conditions
for a short period of time at engine startup, that short exposure
isn't enough to make the Teflon do its job.

So what parts ARE subjected to long-term boundary lubrication?  Top
piston rings (sometimes), top rod bearings, and rocker arms.  That's
about it.  The areas where you see engine failures due to inadequate
lubrication (main bearings, bottom rod bearings, etc.) run so rarely
under boundary conditions that, even if you believe ALL of the Slick
50 claims, they won't benefit.

5.  All the oil-additive companies like to boast that they "drained
the oil out of this car and drove it 20 miles on the freeway."

There is extensive anecdotal evidence supporting both of the 
following:

    a) Many cars WITHOUT Slick 50 can be driven pretty far without
       oil.  

    b) Many cars WITH Slick 50 have burned main bearings after being
       driven for only a few hundred yards without oil.

Given this information, it doesn't seem reasonable to believe that
Slick 50 helps in this situation.

6.  I'd be willing to say that Slick 50 does no harm... Their
particular formulation has been proven, by authorities that I trust,
to keep the Teflon particles from bunching together and clogging oil
passages, filters, etc.  I'm unwilling to say the same for any other
Teflon-based additive; I would DEFINITELY stay away from any product
that required you to "shake well before using".
