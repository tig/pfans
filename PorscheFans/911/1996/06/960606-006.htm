Bob,

Interesting. The '96 fact book lists the P31 (17") and P32 
(18" wheels)
as the sport chassis options, with an asterisk that the C4
sport chassis is the 030. It says the C4S has the turbo suspension,
but of course specs are subject to change ;-). 

You say the M030 has adjustable suspension, it does not appear
to be available on the C2 in the spec book. The people running
C2's in Solo-II were not able to lower their cars much or get
much negative camber. Can you lower your M030 car at
all 4 corners, and does it lower it substantially? Is the
M030 also available on the C2?

That's better than what happened to my friend who went from
5th to 2nd at the end of the straight at Lime Rock ($15,000
repair to his 993 turbo engine, just a few SLIGHTLY bent
valves, he was able to drive it home!). He was back autocrossing
the last two weeks, and feels that his engine is stronger than
ever after the repair! (how can you tell 400 vs 410 HP?).

There are rumours brewing about something like this coming next
year, you know how Porsche always saves the best for last
so they can sell a model on the way out before the new model (996)
arrives! Think 993 C2 RS...
