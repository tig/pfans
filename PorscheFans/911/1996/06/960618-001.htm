Andy, you are right, I have heard this from a number of people who use 
these systems.  With this in mind it is crucial not to skimp on the mounting
kit for the trigger wheel & the magnetic pickup.  Some people have made 
their own & had problems.  I bought mine from Hewitt engineering & it is 
very high quality. It does not move or vibrate.  I don't view this as a
disadvantage
of the system, it simply means you must do it right...like everything else on

a porsche motor.  I just don't understand why someone would give up and 
go back to a distributor when there are at least three or four places to buy
a real quality pickup mount.

Thx,
Jeff
