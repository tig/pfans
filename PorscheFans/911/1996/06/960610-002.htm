I tried this 6 months ago on P'philes, without an answer (but with plenty
of 'me toos'):

I'd like to make my '95 993 Factory alarm:

1. activate remotely by transmitter

2. respond to motion and sonic shock

I spend a lot of time with an installer, randomly checking wires to the
alarm brain, and he couldn't find the magic combination of wires that would
replicate the effect of putting the key in the door and turning it. There's
some mystery here. It may be that there are more than 2 wires that need to
be shorted to activate the alarm. Activating the door locks remotely is a
piece of cake, however. And wiring-in a motion/shock sensor is pretty easy,
too.

Has anybody solved this puzzle? It seems silly to me to put some cheezy
piece-of-crap aftermarket alarm in this car when I have 80% of what I need
already there...
