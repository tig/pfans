Dear Thak,
Peter says he is no longer receiving abything from Porschephiles.  Do you
have the same experience?  If not, would you send the message below to
Porschephiles for me?  As you know I quit subscribing two years ago.
Thanks, Klaus
Amongst the many challenges I have encountered in completing a largely
enjoyable, 5- year, ground-up, restoration of our 1981 911SC Targa I have
come to nagging a problem in a life-important area: the brakes. In
particular, the front brakes now appear to do less braking than before the
restoration.  In the past my front wheels (white cookie cutters) used to
get covered much sooner with black brake dust than the rear wheels.
Returning from the first long trip after the restoration (with new ATE
front calipers and the old rear calipers), I saw to my astonishment that
the rear wheels had much more brake dust on them than the front wheels.
Apparently the rear brakes now do most of the braking.   I also seem to
notice that upon hard braking the front of the car goes less into a dip
than it used to do before.
What is normal braking behavior of the 911?  Should I strive to restore the
old braking behavior?  If so, why do the front wheels now appear to do less
braking?  I considered switching brake lines at the master cylinder.
However, I see no way to switch front and rear brake lines at the master
cylinder without bending brake lines 180o at other sites?  Would that make
a difference anyway?  I am anxious to learn about your suggestions.
