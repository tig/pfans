For all of those so intently following the debugging of my car (I just
know ALL of you are...) I've got a little news.  It looks like Dave
Darling was right!  I crawled under the car, and starting on the
passenger's side, cranked on the hex bolts connecting the headers to the
heads.  Two of them tightened just a little bit.  Then I moved to the
driver's side (where the noise was comming from).  One of the hex bolts
was so loose that as I tightened it, I could actually see the header
rising up into the head!  Sure enough, when I fired it up, no more
noise!  It looks like all I was hearing was the completely unmuffled
noise of the valves closing!  Once I got everything all tightened down,
I revved it a bit to see how the backfiring was doing.  Much, much
better, but still there.  I figure at this point that it's got to be the
fact that I'm using old, bead-blasted copper gaskets.  So, after a quick
trip to Sears to aquifer an awl to tap the gaskets out, I began the
removal of the exhaust.  Keep in mind that this exhaust has only been on
the car for 750 miles.  As I pulled the hex bolt out, I was quite
disheartened to discover that the insert in the head came out with it! 
Yes, all eight of them are inserts.  Now I'm afraid to pull the exhaust
off, for fear that I'll never get it back on.  I know that I'm going to
need to replace those inserts, so this is where the questions begin.

Is this something that I can do?  What experience/tools are required?

Do most P-car repair shops do this kind of stuff?  If so, how much is
typically charged?

If I take it to a shop, will the engine need to be pulled, or can they
be re-done with the engine in the car?

Any help here would be, as usual, GREATLY appreciated!

Thanks again!
