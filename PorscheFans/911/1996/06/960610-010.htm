As Kevin says, F1 cars are not allowed to have ABS, traction control,
active suspensions, or anything else like that. a few years ago,
all the cars had those driver aids. It was getting so that the driver
just sat there are steered. Since then, everything has been banned.

In other series, ABS and traction control are legal, and benefitial.
Why do you think Porsche includes ABS and ABD on the RSR and GT-2 
race cars?
