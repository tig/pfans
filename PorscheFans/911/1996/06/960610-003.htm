Monte,

Mosport is a smooth track. My comment about ABS began with a mention 
to Pete about the fact that ABS on bumps performs poorly.  Another 
disadvantage is that if you lose it, you can't floor the clutch and 
brakes loking all four with the hope that the car will maintain its 
direction of travel even if it happens to be doing 360's. The ABS 
will do it's best to provide threshold braking and the car will try 
and go where the wheels are pointing.  This can lead to off road 
excursions and close encounters with trees and stuff.  For what it's 
worth, race cars don't have ABS either. At least not F1 cars.

BTW, did you really mean trail braking or was that threshold braking? 
It's been years since I've been at Mosport but the usual method of 
dealing with off camber downhills is to brake before the downhill 
section and constant throttle the section until it's safe to squeeze 
the power back on.  Note, *this applies to 911's*, front engine cars 
may prefer a different technique.   If you ever come to Mt-Tremblant, 
I don't suggest you do any of the following in a 911:

    brake going fast down the off camber hill into turn one. 
    trail brake while going fast down the same hill. In a 911 that 
    almost always means stuffing it into the embankment. 


I supect the turn you describe at Mosport must be really different. 
If a student braked down the hill into 1 at my favorite track I'd be 
upset, if he trail braked on top of it, I'd need to go in for a new 
Depends.  There are places where trail braking in a 911 sets the car 
in a slight oversteering attitude (and I mean s*l*i*g*h*t) to make 
the exit line easier. We arent' allowed to teach them though <grin>

2) I kinda miss not having just one list. It was fun to watch all the 
flames. We 911 guys are much more polite than the 944 ruffians 
<laughs>
