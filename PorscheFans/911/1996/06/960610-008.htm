Andy and all,

In response to my comment on ABS, Andy wrote

My initial response was that Andy was pulling my chain, but as the message
seems serious:   My only first-hand experience with ABS and the car pointed
the wrong way was two years ago at Sebring in the rain.  The car had
developed a serious oversteer during the race, I passed another car on the
inside while going down the straigh, that car took all of my rear down force
away and I did a 180 degree manuver that made ESPNs Sport Center coverage.
 While I was a bit busy at the time, my recollection is that the brakes,
going backward in a torrential down pour, worked as well as any brake system
could be expected to perform.  More important, while under full braking, I
was able to steer so that I glanced the wall (rather intently) instead of
backing into it at +120 mph.

We used to do an excerise at the Derek Bell School (going forward) where the
student would pull the ABS fuse, accelerate as fast as possible  and then, at
a cone marker, brake as hard as possible.  After the session, guys with ABS
were allowed to put the fuse back and try it again.  It will amaze you how
much shorter the distance is with ABS.

Anyway, I plan on doing as little experimenting as possible going backwards,
with or without the ABS, and appreciate the comments I've received from Andy,
Mike, Barry, et al.

Porsche On!
