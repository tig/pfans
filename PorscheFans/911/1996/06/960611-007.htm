I shared a plane ride with a Bosch technical rep. He said the ABS 
fitted to race cars is different from what we get on street cars. It 
also costs a fortune. The ABS as originally developed for F1 and now 
found on some other racecars cycles the brakes roughly ten times 
faster than the stuff on street cars.  This improves the behavior on 
bumps a lot. It costs a mint though or as Kevin said "All The Money". 

If I remember the conversation (it was Montreal-London and we were 
into the Martinis pretty well by then), the new Bosch 5 system is 
capable of modulating all the wheels independently and cycles at 5 
times per second. The older ones were slower (hence worse on bumps) 
and not as good as perfectly (yeah I know, few can do it) executed 
threshold braking.  The software has also gotten smarterand I think 
on the ABS-5 includes a deccelerometer as well as engine speed sensor.

The next breakthrough would be in the actuators. The F1 (banned) had 
very trick actuators that could pulse really fast. Expensive. Also 
they use multiple wheel rotation sensors which must be very trick to 
stand up to the heat!

993-Remote Alarm

In Canada, all 993's come with remote alarms. The door has NO KEY 
HOLE. It's still there but you have to remove a plastic cover first. 
The key fob (or on the 96's the key itself, sort of a" MB like"
switchblade affair) has a radio transmitter inside. Push the buttom 
and the car unlocks the doors and the ignition.  If you don't insert 
the key for 90 seconds the ignotion locks itself again and it takes 
another press of the key fob to get it to start.

The fob has a range of about 20-25 feet. No chirps when you 
arm/disarm, just a flash of the parking lights front and rear. If the 
battery in the key dies, you're toast. You can get into the car by 
prying off the caps on the door locks but you have to remeember a 
code number. You enter the number by switching on and then off the 
ignition at a certain rate. To enter 21210 you'd switch one and off 
twice, pause a few seconds then once etc. I keep a spare battery in 
my wallet!

The moral of the story is, go see your dealer! Since all 993's 
imported to this part of the country have it, I bet the wiring 
harness is set up to take a remote alarm system. I bet the factory 
one costs a mint but the wiring should be there for a good 
aftermarket jobbie. P.S. Montreal is the Porsche Stealing Capitol of 
North America.
