Well mine is not a turbo...but along the lines of the conversation: 
 
	I upgraded my rims to 17 in. 
 
	front ----> 225 45 17 
	rear  ----> 245 40 17 
 
 
	A008p Yok's 
 
	Only issue I had was that I had to role the front fender 
	a little because of a slight rub on that lip that sticks out 
	under the fender so we used a round (bat like) piece of wood. 
 
	Popped open the hood got a couple of people to sit inside 
	and just rolled the wood between the tire and fender. 
 
	SO you go from   |		to     	| 
			 |			! | 
			 |			| | 
			 |			| ) 
			 |_____ 		L/ 
 
			     ^ 
			     | 
			     |__Tire would rub here. 
 
 
	No Damage to paint or fender. 
 
	Carefull not to bend it to tight at the "V" might cause 
	cracking later,	 
 
 
	Major change from 15-65 & 60 ---> 17 -45 & 40  <VBG>  
 
	(Makes for happy Driver)

I'm using a 9" wheel on the rear...  The 8.5 would be OK with the 245 =
according to Anderson's performance handbook) but I would stay with the =
225's if I were you.  If the tire is too wide for the rim, any =
anticipated "gains" with the wider rubber would be negated by a =
distorted tire patch.

Take care...

Dave, just a question here.  What size of rim are you using for the =
245x45VR16s? I replaced my tires a while back and bought some
Yoko's AOO8Ps, excellent tires BTW.  I only went with the=20
225x50VR16 for the rear Fuchs.  I wanted the 245 (which really
wouldn't be that much bigger or noticeable) but I don't suppose they
would have been proper for my rear rim size.  It's an 87 Carrera
with 16" Fuchs, I'm assuming the rear is an 8 or 8.5" and not
the 9" of the Turbo...any comments if I decide to go with the
245 next time?

Joe
