>Your report about Le Mans, brought back a lot of memories of my days as a 
>young air force recruit in Wiesbaden AB in '73-75.

PCA Germany Region used to slalom at Wiesbaden in the 80s. It was deactivated
then. Used to get burgers at the commissary. There was a big park full of
armored recovery vehicles and stuff, but no airplanes. It's active again as
home of some military airlift units. I have some fond memories of Wiesbaden
AB too. (Wasn't the officer's club called "The Eagle's Nest" or something?)

Sounds like you saw some really good racing of your own. I saw 935s at Road
America in the 70s and the Kremer K4 at Hockenheim in 81 or 82, but you were
there in the best era.

Go get your own Le Mans moment next year. It's not that hard. Tickets are a
bit pricey but hey, it's for a whole 2 days. Frequent Flyer miles make it
easy (for me at least). You can fly into Paris and take the train. Go rent
the movie by the same name with Steve McQueen to get ideas for how to
collapse into a heap on the ground in an artistically meaningful way... It's
in the first few minutes.
