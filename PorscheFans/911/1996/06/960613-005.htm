Hi JJ,

Finally, something I actually have some experience with! 

After draining the tank, take the filler neck off and look down at the
bottom. Hope you have a good stomach for rust! Check Hemmings Motor News 
for products to seal the inside of the tank. I used an etcher from Bill 
Hirsch and a sealer from Patrick Downing. It's a messy job with some 
really nasty chemicals. The sealer uses something like acetone as the 
solvent, yeow!

Nope, since there's a screen on the larger drain nipple. You might get 
some surprises when you take the nipples off (22mm wrench - be careful 
those are aluminum flare nuts!)

If you have an area outside that you dont' mind spilling stuff on, you
certainly can do it yourself, since I just finished doing my tank. First
thing is to take of the filler neck, evaporator tank, sending unit, and
drain/supply nipples. Once the tank is bare, it's time for the etcher. 
The outside air temperature is important. Don't do these chemicals unless
the temperature outside is over 70, preferably 80. 

Basically, you use duct tape on all but opening in the tank, pour the
etcher in, tape up the last hole, slosh around, etc, as per the
instructions. Let the tank dry for a few days, then it's time for the
sealer. Follow the directions, you only want a thin coating on the inside.
Let cure for a few days, then paint the outside of the tank because you've
invariably spilled some of these chemicals on the outside, ruining the
paint. Be sure to tape up the openings before you paint, since you don't
want any overspray into the inside of the tank. I used rustoleum primer
and gloss black paint after a thorough sanding. 

I took the filler neck to the local powder coater and had it coated in
gloss black epoxy for 15$. I took the nipples to a plate shop and had them
zinc plated. Now the fun part comes when you try to find replacements for
the nipple gaskets(!). I used neoprene O rings from the local hardware
emporium. I dont' recall the exact sizes. Use anti-sieze on all threaded
connections when re-assembling. 

Patrick Downing: 800-752-1563 1 quart of sealer - 16.95$, including shipping
Bill Hirsch: 800-828-2061 etcher - 8.95$ per 16oz, 1 quart sealer - 19$
