Hi all,
I'm casually looking around for a 911 to replace my fun
but no-so-quick 84 944.  I was wondering if any of you
who subscribe to Excellence had anything to say about
the 911 Market Report prices they published.  Here in the
SF Bay area, it seems like the 84-85 coupes and Targas
are selling for at least $25-30k - and there are plenty of them for
sale, so demand can't be that high.  I don't have the exact Excellence
numbers in front of me, but they seem to indicate that you can get a
good-to-excellent 84 for around $16-20k.  Are they talking about some
other part of the country?  I thought CA was the "cheap" used Porsche
capital of the Universe.  An awful lot of those classified ads say
"firm" by the price....  What would you pay for an 84 911 in excellent
condition?

Colin
