Mr. Gross, thank you very much for accusing me of committing a crime,
in a public forum, no less.  Excuse me if I come off as defensive, but my
company spends millions of dollars every year policing and prosecuting
the bandits who steal intellectual property, so I am extremely sensitive to
this issue.  

As is the case with any software product you or I license, it is entirely
legal, and is often recommended, that a backup copy be maintained,
regardless of the original distribution media type.  Granted, most of the
population will not find a need to make a backup copy of their
automobile's software, but a small percentage of us, who may upgrade
their software more often than the norm of never, are absolutely entitled
to do so.

I'll step off my soap box now - didn't we leave this kind of crap on the
"old" Porschephiles list?!

Brad
