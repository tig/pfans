You drop the motor and transaxel together. About 3 hr job (with a little
experience and that for removal only). At 77 k I did my clutch and rebuilt
the trans. I don't know if the reason the synchros were out but I asssumed
the PO used them instead of replacing the clutch. You have an option on what
to reinstall. I decided to go with the aluminum pressure plate. Cast (I
believe) was standard on most. Here's the caviot..

 A proper clutch job includes removal of the flywheel and resurfacing it. It
also includes installing a new piolet bearing and throwout bearing. You also
need new 
flywheel bolts as they are a 1 use thing. While your there you want to take
advantage
of any gaskets or PM you can. Check cam seals, replace the oil thermostat
gasket (they're a pain to do while the motor is in car and their cheap! Do
valve tappet adjustments, replace oil pressure sender gasket and temp
gasket. I'm a little anal about these types of things, but I don't like to
sidestep either. Then again, I do the labor.

 So now you have a decision to make. Do you do the trans work while doing
the clutch?
I am realy gentle on syncros and that it what I would do in your possition.
I don't
do trans work and spent about 2k doing my job (including new tenisoners) and
did the rest of the labor my self. Figure about 400 for the clutch kit and
200 for the tensioners. The rest was spent on labor with my trans guru. Well
spent, as he is my 1st phone call when I need help.


so.. 12-14 hrs for the *compleate* job (see above) is not tooooo out of
hand. Assuming you have a tech that cars as much about your car as you do.
You do get what you pay for

Figure it this way
3 out
3 in
1 separation
1 machine work on flywheel
1 reassembly
3 miscl replacement of gaskets, seals, general tlc, test drive, oil change,
valve adjustment.

See how it add up?

ps... how's the condition of the engine sound pad?? :-) I could go on and on!
