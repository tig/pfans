Hello all,

I WILL be moving to Massachussetts at the end of July - thanks for all your
input! In a previous message I mentioned that I could not justify taking my 914
with me and thus was interested in selling it - well, now I'm sure that I will,
and in a hurry too!.

I've had some inquiries and questions but did not list a price ($3500 as is or
$4,500 with new carpet, redone seats and new rockers installed). I will forward
a detailed list to anyone interested - contact me at mattingly@cmd.com. Basics
are as follows:

- 1974 914, silver/black, with 120,000 miles, I am the 2nd owner.
- Rebuilt 2.0 with less than 1,500 miles (1995); mild cam but otherwise stock. 

  Passed recent California smog test.
- Rebuilt (1994) gearbox (w/ stock 1.7 gearset) with less than 10K miles.
- New clutch and exhaust (1994) with less than 10K miles.
- New upgraded (Automotion) throttle and clutch cables (1994).
- New 195x50xHR15 tires (1996), Uhhh...nothing great here, "kumyo" or similiar.
- Appearance group front spoiler
- Euro lenses F&R
- Automotion harness bar and RJS 4-point harnesses; also stock belts.
- 140 lb. Weltmeister rear springs and 21 mm front torsion bars.
- Recent brakes (new front rotors and pads, less than 2500 miles)
- ALL New rubber weatherseals and trim (1989), over $750 in receipts.
- Rustfree California car, stripped to bare metal in 1988 and refinished at
  cost of over $3500 in original color (Silver Glasurit).
- New domestic carpet (in box, needs installation).
- NEW OEM rocker panels - painted and ready to install.

Mechanically the car is in great condition, it does need shocks and the
bushings should be replaced as well. Other than that, it is ready to roll.

Please feel free to contact me at mattingly@cmd.com or call (714)583-0376,
evenings, 6Pm to 10PM PST. Thanks,

Barry Mattingly
CMD Technology, Inc.
