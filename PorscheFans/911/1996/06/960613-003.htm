Michael-
I restitched two steering wheels about five years ago, one was mine, one
belonged to a friend.  I don't know anything about a baseball stitch, I
just went in a figure eight pattern with a heavy silk suture thread and a
large curved suture needle.  I had to make two passes to make it look
like the original stitching.  If I were to do it again I would use two
needles and do both passes at the same time, and try to borrow a
bicycle repair stand to hold the wheel.  The whole proceedure was one
of the most boring things I have ever done.  The wheel is rather awkward
to work on, and since it is black it can be a bit hard to see what you are
doing. I for one will never do another one, I will pay to have someone
else do it and consider it a bargain at twice the price.

Regards
Tom Smith
