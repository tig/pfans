Well, I thought I'd let you all know that after a couple of months with both of 
my early 911s I've decided to keep the '73S.  I have been alternating both of 
them and find myself wanting to drive the S all the time now.  I know many of 
you would say Im nuts, but I use the S as my commuter car.  It make my 35 mile 
(each way) much more enjoyable.  Also, since I adjusted my valves, timing, 
points, changed oil and filter and changed the fuel filter, my MPG has gone from  
about 14mpg to 18mpg (mixed city and hiway).

The '71T gets about 20 to 22mpg (mixed) so it doesnt really save me much in gas 
compared to the S.  Performance is the biggie of course.  The T is quick while 
the S is FAST!  Also, there is a MAJOR difference in the feel of the suspension.  
The T doesnt have a rear sway bar, so I believe this is the main cause for the 
difference.  The S feels much more solid, even though it is a TARGA.  Finally, 
the Recaro Seats in the S are the MOST comfortable early 911 seats Ive sat in.  
The stock T seats hurt your back after about 50 miles of driving and the seats 
in my T are like new.  

I discovered that the PO had placed epoxy on the exhaust valve covers on my S 
which was causing oil to leak out of the covers.  I scraped off all the epoxy 
and old gaskets and replaced them during my valve adjustment and voila! no 
leaks.

The major adjustment I made was to my throttle travel.  My S was driven for most 
of its life by the wife of a lawyer in San Francisco.  She apparently thought 
the car was too fast and had the throttle stop screw under the accelerator pedal  
turned out so that you only got about one third of the total travel.  I turned 
the stop screw down until I got complete travel and WOW.  It was an S again.  

Anyway, I just thought I'd share this with all of you.  If any of you are in the 
market for a VERY clean totally stock '71T you can check out pictures of it at
