Greetings,

I have been quietly following this thread on MFI hoses etc. and it seems to
me some clarification is in order.  Steve Watson has been using the terms
"inner and outer hoses" and it seems to me there is some confusion on their
use.  The hose which goes from the engine sheet metal to the thermostat is,
in fact, composed of two hoses. An inner hose, (part # 901.110.295.00) which
is attached to the spigot on the sheet metal and the spigot on the injection
pump by hose clamps, and the outer hose (part # 901.110.296.00) which is
slightly shorter and floats between the hose clamps, acting as additional
insulation.  When new, you sometimes have to stretch the inner hose just a
bit so you have enough sticking out of each end of the outer hose for the
hose clamps.  You do *not* put the hose clamps over both hoses is you are
installing them correctly.  The hose which goes from the engine sheet metal
to the spigot on the heat exchanger is a totally different hose (part #
999.181.212.50)  This hose is of a reinforced rubber construction with a very
thick wall (7mm) and has excellent insulating properties.  To my knowledge it
is only available through Porsche.  The proper use of these hoses cannot be
overstated since the distance the hot air has to travel from the heat
exchanger to the thermostat is considerable (just under 40") and heat loss
through the hose walls by use of the wrong hoses can present a real problem
to the proper operation of the thermostat.  Without an adequate supply of hot
air, it will not function correctly.  Which brings up the other component in
the hot air to the thermostat equation.  The drivers side heat exchanger
itself.  If it's full of holes, as a great many of them are, not only will
your heater be anemic, but again, your thermostat will not function.  

just my (and the factories) .02
