I saved the following relevant information from a thread in Porschephiles.
It was submitted by   Mark_Salvetti@abbsmtp.abb.com and I apologize
in advance if he objects to my quoting him ... but then again, he may never
know ... I only just got here after waiting for P'philes to get back online :")

         To sum up, as far as I know no one has come up with a
          US-made car seat to fit the rear of a 911.  Some folks have
          bought them from AFN in the UK, but AFN told John the seats
          available now require 3-point belts.

          When we were in Germany this past fall, we bought a car seat
          from the factory which fits perfectly in our 1979 911SC, and
          as a bonus can be used as a booster seat in any vehicle.  I
          think this may be what AFN is selling now.  It consists of
          four pieces, each sold separately:  a seat bottom, a
          backrest (that straps to the seat bottom), a shield or table
          that the seatbelt passes through and secures the child
          across the thighs and midsection, and an insert that fits
          under the seat bottom (928/944/968 only).

          The parts you need depend on weight ranges:  for 9 kg to 18
          kg you need all the pieces, for 15 kg to 25 kg you don't
          need the backrest, and for 15 kg to 36 kg you only need the
          bottom.  The part numbers are: 000 802021002CZ for the seat
          bottom and 000 802041002CZ for the table.  We didn't need
          the backrest, so I don't know that part number.

          The instructions say that you need a 3-point belt, but
          the salesperson told us we didn't, so I didn't realize it
          until I got home.  In use, I don't see that the 3-point belt
          is really needed when used with the table and the seat
          bottom.  You are supposed to thread the lap belt through
          a couple of hooks on the seat bottom, then the table, and
          then fasten it to the seat belt buckle.  This secures both
          pieces of the seat and fastens the table snuggly against the
          child's body to keep him/her from flying forward.  In this
          respect, it looks much like a typical US booster seat.  The
          shoulder portion of the belt comes up through the center of
          the table, but that puts it several inches away from the
          child depending on his/her size.  I don't see that it does
          much good there.  A lap belt only seems to work fine to
          fasten the table and hold the child snuggly in the seat.  To
          me, it looks safer than many US booster seats.

          For the higher weight range, the seat bottom serves to
          boost the child up so the conventional seatbelt is more
          effective.  You definitely need a three point belt for this.

          The factory told me they would not ship to the US, but maybe
          things have changed.  You could try calling the parts
          department at (0711) 827-0.  The table and seat bottom cost
          us about $60 each.  If the factory won't ship, maybe a
          German dealership will. You might also want to check part
          numbers with AFN and see if they are selling the same seat
          we bought.

          Sorry for this disclaimer, but:  I doubt the European seats
          are approved by DOT, NHTSA, etc.  Also, I am not advocating
          using the above child seat against the instructions with
          only a lap belt.  Do so at your own risk.
