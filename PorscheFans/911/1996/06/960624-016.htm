Spent Saturday waxing the car. Let me say I'm extremely pleased 
with the results. I used Mequire's Number 7 first. It's called Showroom Glaze
on the bottle and is supposed to "penetrate to the deep layers of 
the paint with cleansing oils and bring out the original deep shine (who the
hell writes this stuff??)." Yeah, whatever. Anyway, it's a liquid that dries
pretty much clear and you wipe it off immediatly after applying it. After 
wiping off #7, the paint looked nicer but "blurry". Then you apply #6 
which is the Cleaner/Wax which is also a liquid (I think the only difference 
between #6 and #26 is that the latter is a paste, yes?). After applying 
#6, it turns into a beige crust on your car which you let sit for at 
least 5 minutes. I let it sit for about 15. Then remove #6 with clean 
cotton cloths. I did and the results were outstanding. First off, the 
quality of the finish was unlike anything I'd seen on my car. It was 
better than when I bought from the dealer last year. The finish is 
*deep*. You can fall into it. You can put your make-up on it. Brush your 
teeth, etc. Second, you don't have to have the biceps of Ahhh-Nold to 
remove the wax. It comes off fairly easily. Third (and really important 
to me), it didn't leave streaks. Being a dark, glossy car, Liquid Glass 
caused a serious streaking problem for me. I spent hours trying to buff 
some of those streaks out. With Mequire's not a single streak. Since Iw 
as essentially applying two coats, it did take me the better part 3 and 
half hours to do the entire job. In 103 degree weather. But it was worth 
it. The car looks absolutely beautiful. Thanks to everyone for their advice!
