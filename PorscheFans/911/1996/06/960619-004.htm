	I've never done a 6 cylinder version, but I have done the 4
cylinder VW versions which are basically the same.
	The fuel distributor is relatively simple inside, but there
are several springs and  other small parts that you must be very
careful with when you open it up. This is going to be off of the top
of my head, so bear with me.
	All of this assumes you have the distributor out of the
car(and off the air box), with all lines off. Be careful of the
plunger in the bottom , center of the unit. It may fall out, and if
it gets the slightest nick in it, you're SOL. It may stick in also.
If it does, leave it. If you can remove it without too much effort,
carefully do so and set it aside.
	The next step is to remove the small filters that are on the
top of the unit. There is one per injector line fitting. It looks
like a small cap with an allen head. Remove it. inside will be
another small screwed in device. Screw it out while ***counting the
number of turns ***. Write this down and don't confuse one reading
from another. I think these serve as a fuel metering devices. You
must screw them back in later exactly as far as they were in
originally. Under these will be small fuel filters. Remove them and
clean them. This is your injectors last protective barrier, so
hopefully they did their job.
	The next step is to split the distributor case itself. First,
straighten the lock washer in the bottom center of the unit, around
the plunger. Then remove the large, flat nut. Keep track of the order
that you remove everything so you can keep it straight for
reassembly. If the plunger is still in, be very careful of it. It is
the key to the whole unit. It is hand fit to the unit and cannot be
swapped out with another.
	There are now around 4 screws on the bottom face which are
holding the unit together. Remove them. The unit may come right
apart, but most likely fuel deposits will hold them tight. This is
another crucial point. For each injector, there is a spring and two
(I think) small disks inside with a thin metal diaphram/gasket
holding them all in place. You must pull the unit apart while keeping
up with all the stuff that's going to try and fly out. The internal
parts are all the same, so it's not a big deal if they get mixed up,
but you need them all and you must see at least one spring/disk
assembly to see how they go together. (If they do get screwed up, let
me know and I'll take a look at one of my spares) If the plunger is
still in, you'll need to use a twisting  motion to break everything
apart. Don't be surpised if you need to take a hammer to it to break
things loose. Just make sure you hit it on a corner so that is twists
about the plunger axis (if it's still in). Remove the plunger as soon
as you can without messing it up.
	Now it's just a matter of taking some carb cleaner to clean
out the gunk - usually rust colored film/slime from water inthe
lines, bad fuel, etc. It'll take a little coordinatin to set
everything back in place and then put the case halves back together,
but it really is a "reverse steps" process.
	Like I said earlier, the key is to be careful wth the
plunger, and to keep track of  everthing you take out so you can put
it back the same way. As long as the unit just has trash in it and
isn't worn or rusted internally, a good cleaning should take care of
it. I forget, but I think the plunger is supposed to slide in and out
 smoothly and be able to hold itself in under it's own weight, but
it's been several years since I've done this.
	There are no gaskets needed except fot the air sealing O-ring
around the plunger where it mounts to the air box (can usually be
reused) and the copper line gaskets.
	The pressure regulator is much the same only easier. Fuel
gunk can clog it up. Open it up and clean it out with carb cleaner. I
think the electrical heating element has it's resistance marked on it
inside. Check it with a meter. If it's close to it's value and you
can get all of the gunk cleaned out of the line screens and internal
passages, it should be fine. There isn't anything inside that can't
be taken apart and cleaned. It's just a metallic diaphram with a rod
from the heating element to act on it.
	Go for it, the worse thing that can happen is you'll learn
something, at best you'll save big $$. I've done a couple of them for
H2O cooled VW's with CIS and it's worked like a charm on all but one,
and the reason was that it had rusted inside.
	Like I said It's been a while since I've done this so my
memory is rusty. Let me know if you need more info.
