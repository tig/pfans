I'm aware that these informations aren't useful to the most of you American
fellows, but I post them just for the sake of completeness...
I'm just back from the Gorini Porsche Training School, attended at the Imola
F.1 track. The event took two full days, (8:30 AM - 18:00 PM), extremely
tiring and exciting. These events are sponsorized by Porsche Italia (Italian
Porsche importer) and the cars are 993 Carrera and Carrera  4 with
switchable ABS. You can also choose to drive your car, as I do, saving some
money but, more important, knowing better and enjoying your car. She needs
very much this kind of nearly racing treatment! Of course we used the school
cars for hard braking tests
Imola track is one of the best in the world, long, fast and full of
different kinds of  turns (BTW, at the end of the second day we drive on
inverse sense on the track to try different turns). The instructors are
professional racing drivers, very tough and pretending.
Rates are 1800 US$ with your car and 2250 with school cars.
After the first level you are admitted to a Super event in an other track
(Misano) more oriented to race driving. I plan to attend it next year.
The experience was extremely useful and worths the bucks.
I already drove on track very often, but I learned a lot from the school.
