There are a couple people in the Southern California area that are good with
mechanical fule inj. 911's. 

I have a 1970 911E with MFI and have had the following people work on it.

Lee Rice in Garden Grove
OTTO's in Venice/Marina del Rey
Jeff Devito in Orange

Each of these people are very good with MFI. Lee and OTTO's have gotten the
best performance out of my 2.2. I still have the original system that came on
the car. After over 350,000 miles it needs a little tweek now and then to get
the most out of it.

Good luck!!
