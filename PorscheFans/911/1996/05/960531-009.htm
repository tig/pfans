The cable which replaced the one with the nylon slide was an exact duplicate,
except for the slide material. (Steel instead of nylon).  This cable has now
been replaced with a third cable carrying a 964 part number.  The only
difference between it and the 2nd generation cable is that the cable itself
is wrapped with a fuzzy material.  They interchange but I would make sure the
tubes in the body are perfectly clear before installing it.  (I would
probably do them both since you already have it apart.  The other one *is*
going to break, you just don't know when).
