I agree. What I do object to, however, is when VW, or Audi, let's say,
charges $130 or $150 for an oxygen sensor. It's made by Bosch and repackaged.
You can buy the exact same Bosch part number from a Ford dealer for an Escort
application for about $30. And if you shop the independents you might even
beat that. 

I learned my lessons about quality when buying machine and hand tools. I used
to buy on price from a low-buck importer ("heck, how bad can it be? And it's
so CHEAP"). But then I would spend more time than the piece was worth, taking
it back the next day when I looked at it more carefully and realised what
total junk I had bought. I'm thinking about tools brought in from Red China
and the like. Nowadays, I only buy American, European or Japanese tools, and
I pay for it but as you pointed out, you get what you pay for.

That goes for cars too. Porsches are expensive for a good reason. If you
can't swing a new Porsche, you can still do pretty well with a used one. No
car is an investment but Porsches and Mercedes consistently seem to do best
at holding their value.
