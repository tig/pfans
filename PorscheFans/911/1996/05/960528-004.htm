Hi P-Fans,

I'd like to change the oil in my transmission (G-50).  I have several
quarts of Valvoline Synthetic SAE75W90 in my garage, but I'm unsure if the
synthetic oil is OK to use in the gearbox.  The manual doesn't specify
either petroleum or synthetic.  I can't imagine how the synthetic could
cause any problems (may even help a bit!) but I thought I'd run it by the
list.

Also, over the weekend a small spider decided to build a web inside my
speedometer, between the glass and the face, just below the lowest reach of
the needle.  I'd like to send the speedo out for a cleaning, but since the
car is my daily transportation I'm not sure if driving itr for a day or two
without the speedo will do any harm.  I looked at the wiring diagram in the
Haynes manual and noted that the speedo is connected to the cruise control
among others.  Does anyone have thoughts on this?

Thanks for your help, and to Peter for starting this new list!
