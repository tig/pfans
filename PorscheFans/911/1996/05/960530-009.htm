Hi, Dan.

The 993 is one of the best handling cars I've ever driven. And Porsche didn't
pay me to say that. I test cars for Autoweek. At last count I've done
instrumented testing of 244 cars, and driven probably that many more for just
subjective impressions. The 993 is one of the few cars that I would actually
buy myself if I had the cash. Most of the other cars I would buy were made
about 25-35 years ago :-)  I think most new cars are so good, they're deadly
boring. The 993 isn't boring.

For ride and road isolation, the 993 is several rungs up the ladder from the
earlier 911 models. We didn't know a few years ago how much better a 911
could be! The 993 goes faster, sticks better, and does it all without beating
up the occupants. It has very sticky tires as original equipment yet there is
minimal road harshness (for a sports car; yes, a big Mercedes is smoother...)

See, that's what I mean by 25-35 year old cars. I have three Porsche 356s.
One driver, one concours, one racer-to-be.

>I do appreciate your comments.  Any thoughts on reliability of a 911/996?

Don't know for sure but Porsche reliability has been pretty remarkable. The
3.0 and 3.2 liter engines of the past decade and a half are known to go
300,000 miles if treated right.

When things do break, they can be expensive, like any German car. Even VW
gets incredible prices for parts. Dealer service is a luxury that few can
afford once the warranty expires, but thankfully there are plenty of good,
knowledgeable shops around the country. You have to find the good ones, avoid
the hackers. Like any other business, most will be hackers.

I'm posting a copy of this publicly. Figure this conversation is of general
interest too.
