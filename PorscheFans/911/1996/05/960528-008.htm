Ron,
I don't think you'ld have a problem, but...
Just in case, you could disconnect the speedo sending unit.  This would
kill the electrical signal from the entire line.  Any system
connected to the input or output of the speedo would simple sense that
the car was stopped.  You don't have to remove the speedo sensor itself,
just disconnect it.  The wire is a flat two wire molex type connector
accessible in the center tunnel.  You can access it through the tunnel
cap under the carpet between the two passenger jump seat foot wells.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne

PS. Ron, this was a recreation of what I sent you.  I just forgot to echo
it to the list also.  The list will provide technical review and criticism
if I'm wrong :-)
