There was a '68S!  It had webers.

On the older S cars, you can expect punch starting at around 5000 RPM.
Off the line, they're dawgs!

My '73S goes from 0-60 in the sixes.  That's pretty good power!  My '69S
did it in around eight seconds (before I broke her).  Neither one is much
off the line, but the '73 is noticably better than the '69.

Actually, in '72 they bumped it up again to 2.4.

The 'E' and 'S' models from '69 to '73.  The 2.4Ts also had it (in '72 too?).

>but would that make a noticable increase in power and horsepower?

Yup.
