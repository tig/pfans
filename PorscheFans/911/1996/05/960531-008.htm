A couple of weeks ago, I finally got eh opportunity to take a 911 out fora
test drive. It was a 1968 911 (the dealer tried to claim it was a 911S).

The car was a lot of fun to drive, and to be seen in, but it just didn't
seem to have any real power or speed! I had expected more from a 911.

Now, I had been looking for an early 70s 911, but now I'm not so sure if I
would be happy with one.

My question for all you 911-gurus, is how much extra power do those early
70s 911s have? I know Porsche bumped up the displacement from 2.0L to 2.2L,
and many models had MFI, but would that make a noticable increase in power
and horsepower?

If it isn't noticable, I guess I'll have to wait for the 911 of my dreams,
becaue that '68 911 sure wasn't the car of my dreams.

On another note, whoever the list administrator is, when I sent this
message the first time I just hit the reply command. I later found out that
that sends it to PorscheFans-request, not PorscheFans-911. Could you not
add a reply-to: header in the messages?

'85 535i (for sale, and it can beat that '68 911 any day. That just isn't
right!)
