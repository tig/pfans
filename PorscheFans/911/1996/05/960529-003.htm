Hi guys! Nice to see a Porsche-list alive. Thanks to those 
responsible for getting P-fans up!

On that "other" list (which no one seems to mention) I promised a 
follow up on the spongy brake pedal on my C4S.  I went through the 
usual inspections, change brake fluid, bleed, bleed again including 
the master cylinder and still no solution. Finally I met the PCNA 
factory rep. 

He explained that cars with the Turbo brakes use a very different 
actuation system. The 993 uses a hydraulic booster operated directly 
by the pedal. Hence the short travel and solid-as-a-brick feel.

The C4S and Turbo are very different. They use an accumulator with 
its own pump. It is *normal* to have a brake warning light for 30-50 
seconds when you start in the morning. The accumulator pump can be 
heard quite distinctly.

The brake pedal on Turbo brake equipped 993's operates the 
accumulator valve. Alas the long pedal travel, increased assist and 
spongy pedal is normal. We tried two C4S and a Turbo, all had the 
long pedal travel (compared to the 993) and soft feel.  I left him 
with the comment that Porsche had taken a step backwards as far as 
I'm concerned. Soooo, long pedal travel and spongy feel is normal. 
I'll have to get used to it.
