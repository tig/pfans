Hi Porschefans

I just joined the list.  Any other former Porschephiles on here yet?  

Well, I took aparth the sunroof on my T.  Not too difficult actually.  I was 
able to slide my sunroof back manually because the plastic fittings at the end 
of the sunroof cables were not attached to the roof.  One fitting is broken 
(damn) and the other is fine.  

Anyone have experience with this?  I would install the new cables but I 
understand that new cable guiderails are required and its a pretty major job 
so....  

Thanks
