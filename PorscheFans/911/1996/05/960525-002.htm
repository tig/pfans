Hi, Steve.

Absolutely. But right now we're limited by our present version of the
software. Like the strange old man said to the catapult operator, "let's see
if this baby will fly." We are limited to five sections, and those are taken
up by the "five food groups." If we had six, yeah, I'd do that in a
heartbeat. So please be patient, we'll get this running even smoother. For
the time being, at least it works. We can communicate again.

I have no problem sending it 5x. In America Online I have a group in my
address book called "porschefans all" which sends it out to all 5 subgroups.

Appreciate your not wanting to read it 5x though, and we'll look into fixing
that "feature.".

Also, I'm cc'ing this to the list for their information.

Pete
