We've only been up since midnight Friday so there's no FAQ or archives yet.
Traffic is being saved but it's not yet organized in archives.

If you can swing it, get the 95.

Big handling improvements. Completely different rear suspension. lots of
detail refinement. The 95 is, uh, Quicker, as it were. ("It's you! It's
you!")

There is only one automatic and that's the Tiptronic. No conventional
automatic. The standard trans is the six-speed manual.

>Can I use it as a daily driver? 

Absolutely. Porsches are the only exotics you can drive every day. Even the
Turbo.

>What should I watch out for in a used one?

Donnow. Maybe somebody else has more experience in living with one of the
newer ones.
