Glad to see a new list up and going since porschephiles died 5/17.  Not 
sure how many people are on this list yet but any help/ideas would be 
appreciated!  Seems that my 2.7 has been blowing out some blue smoke on 
start up.  It only happens after the car has sat overnight or for the 
entire day and it does not happen every time.  Some times it starts up with 
no smoke at all and other times it smokes quite a bit.  It only smokes for 
about 3-5 seconds.  It never smokes once underway.  The engine had a 
rebuild about 10k miles ago, but the original piston/cylinders were reused 
and new rings were installed.  When I bought the car last fall this did not 
occur.  At the time of purchase the leakdown was around 6% for all 
cylinders.  The car uses up very little oil.  Any ideas what is going on?  
Valve guides?  Should I worry about it? (Well I guess I already am, but 
should I REALLY worry about it?)
