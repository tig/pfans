They all do that. I bought four 911s new, and they all did that from Day One.
It got a little less after a few thousand miles but never went away.

You may not have noticed it. Or maybe it really didn't.

The usual explanation I've heard is that oil leaks past the valves after the
engine has been shut down. Standing overnight lets lots more oil leak past.

Should I worry about it? (Well I guess I already am, but
