Bev> There are a couple people in the Southern California area that are good

Bev>I have a 1970 911E with MFI and have had the following people work on it.

Bev> Lee Rice in Garden Grove
Bev> OTTO's in Venice/Marina del Rey
Bev> Jeff Devito in Orange

I'm using Greg Brown; I believe he's in Fullerton.  When I asked for a good 
mechanic in the area, Bruce Anderson recommended him.  I used Bernd 
(I forgot his last name) in Dana Point for my '69.  He was pretty good,
but he seems to be in semi-retirement -- that's why I went looking for
a new wrench.
