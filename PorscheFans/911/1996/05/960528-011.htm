Guys,

I just thought I'd share my joy at having found, after a two-year search, a
1973 911S Targa.  I bought it from Steve Watson (a porschephile's member) in
San Francisco about six months ago (I have been waiting to tell P-files but,
well, that's another story).  My search took me from Jackson Hole Wyoming
(the mechanic lied to me on the phone, so I flew up to find more rust than 
on the Titanic) to San Diego California.

The car is Aubergine (though it was originally silver), has sport seats,
leather interior, and air conditioning.  When I got it, it had less than
100,000 miles on it -- with receipts to prove it.  Way cool.

Since I got it, I completely went through the mechanical injection (actually, 
I had someone who knows what he's doing go through the injection), added 
Carrera chain tensioners, and replaced the alternator and regulator.  I 
eventually have to rebuild the injection before I re-carpet and re-paint.  I'll
be asking lots of restoration and authenticity questions on this list to help
me with this task.

I put together a web page on the car (hey, I was *STOKED*).  I believe the
URL is http://www.deltanet.com/users/guthrie/porsche.htm.

BTW, I put together a 911 FAQ for porschephiles.  Is anyone interested in me
posting it or providing it for web-access in relation to this list?
