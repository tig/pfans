I had to bite the bullet and get a Snap-On. Our local truck carried it. 
Sears also carries a 36 mm 1/2" drive socket, for cheap ($5.99?) but it's a
12-point. In this size, a 12-point socket should more properly be called a
roughing shell mill, 12-flute. All due respect to George B., but don't get a
12-point. There are applications on a Porsche that require humongous torque
on a 36 mm wrench, and you don't want a 12-point for that. Sooner or later
you're going to be tempted to use that 12-point to tighten axle nuts, or
worse, try to use it to get axle nuts _OFF_, with an air impact wrench...
Wear your bomb squad gear.

Have you ever heard of a machine tool supply company called MSC? They stock
an incredible variety of tools and supplies, from big CNC milling machines to
watchmakers' screws. They carry a 1/2" drive 36 mm 6-point impact socket (the
kind to get for this work; the Sears Craftsman isn't impact anyway). It's
made by Proto, ordering number 85212462, price $12.69. They also have a 3/4"
drive for $15.12.

Any tool freak out there needs to get the MSC catalog. Call them up at
1-800-645-7270, order the free catalog, and within days the flatbed truck
will arrive at your door with all 3472 (honest, nearly 3500 pages) of tools. 

Since this socket is used in a variety of Porsche applications, I'm
crossposting to all five lists.
