Does anyone have data on the heat range of various spark plugs, or 
know where to find such information?   It seems like such an 
important thing, yet this stuff damn hard to find! I'd really like to know 
the heat range difference between 

Bosche ...3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, 7's....
Nippon Denso ...16's, 17's,....
NGK ...5's, 6's, 7's, 8's....

I know higher Biosche num,bers are hotter and vice versa for the 
others, but what's the actual temperature range of the plugs?

Among other things, here's what's bugging me.

1) My '72E is supposed to have WR5's, I think.  Who knows?  Is there 
an agreed upon standard?  It's now running on WR7's, a hotter plug --
yeah, but how much hotter?--without fouling problems, yet the plugs 
are still all black whenever I look at them.  It came with WR7's, they 
looked OK, so I left them in.

2) My '72T I think is supposed to have WR3's or 4's, maybe 5's.  Again, 
who knows? Well, I couldn't get any of these locally, so I bought ND 
W22's which is what came up in Big Al's (local emporium) reference 
book for a '72T.  They had a bit of a fouling problem.  Local shop said 
they would use W16's, which I think is a cooler plug than the 22's, but I 
tried them anyway.  They seem fine, although when I pull them for 
inspection 2 and 5 are always nice and white or slightly colored, and the 
rest are black.  Why don't these cooler plugs foul? 

3) Here's the part that really bothers me.  I found a local place (NAPA, 
who would have thought of going there first) that had Bosche plugs (for 
98 cents each, amazingly) so I bought a set of WR7DC's, the ones that 
work so well in the E, and I put them in the T.  Not more than 25 miles 
later it was obvious there was a fouling problem.  I took them out, put 
the W16's back in, and it runs fine.

What's happening?  Why are the cooler plugs better with respect to 
fouling?  Are they really cooler?  How much?  Why T?  Why do 
cylinders 2 and 5 seem leaner?  Are they just hotter because they are the only ones surrounded  by other hot cylinders?  (They could be getting less fuel from the MFI  pump.  It's the only thing I haven't checked.  That's next.)

Why am I concerned about all this when both cars are running great?  
Because it doesn't make sense and I'd like to figure out what's going on, 
if possible.

Any ideas?

'72 911's T&E

P.S. Both engines are freshly rebuilt with new guides and valves where 
needed.  All the injectors seem about the same according to testing with 
a rig I put together.  They all open at the specified pressure and close 
properly.  

P.P.S.  Tom Smith--The heat range info may have been in the Bosche 
book I borrowed from you last year.  Can't remember, and if it is, obviously I 
didn't write it down. Would you mind looking?  Thanks.  Gonna be 
here the 16th for the track day at SIR?
