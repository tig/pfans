Scott,

This is a pretty common occurence, and does not necessarily indicate a
problem.  My '83 SC has been doing this for the last 5 years/50K miles
(since I've owned it.)  Oil consupmtion is nil, and it runs great.

I've heard various explanations, the most recent being that the rings rotate
in the piston grooves, , and that when the gap in the oil ring is on the
bottom, oil seeps past.

It's all related to the dry sump horizontal boxer engine.  When the sump is
dry, as when running or shortly after being turned off, most of the oil is
in the tank (and coolers, and lines).  When stopped, the oil will slowly
seep past the oil pump back into the engine sump.  When it's deep enough to
be sitting in the bottom portion of the cylinder sleeves, you are subject to
the start-up smoking syndrome.  If this is the cause of your start-up smoke,
it is not a problem.  Doesn't mean there can't be another cause that is a
problem, but it sounds pretty normal to me.
