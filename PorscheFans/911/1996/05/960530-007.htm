Obviously this is also correct and possible. But if the occurence is after
sitting for only 1 night then my experience is that the guides or seals are
bad...but usually you get smoke on the overrun as well (at high RPM). Not a
serious problem unless the car is an older 911 with non-CD ignition (which
can't handle any plug fouling) or the smoke gets to the "bug killer" range.

Good luck and best regards,
