So, yesterday I was coming down from Skyline Drive on Rt 9 into Saratoga
and I was smelling intermittent burning clutch/brake material.  But, I
could not determine if it was me, the guy in front of me, or just something
odd in the air.  I was descending with very little (if any) caliper
braking.  I was staying in 3rd or 4th gear with zero throttle and the engine
drag gave me near constant descent rate.  In all other driving, I've noticed
no clutch slipping nor brake problems.  So, the question ... with 80K on my
911, and the above symptoms, could it be time for a clutch?  Or, was I
probably smelling someone else?  I'll most likely go out and drive the
route again to see if it comes back.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
'87 911 Targa
