I went to the Swiss premiere of the Boxster last night with my son (age 3) - 
quite interesting with a fashion show thrown in (babes/clothes etc. :-)

3 boxsters were there - two in softtop guise and one with a colour co-ordinated
hardtop. There was also a 550RS there too...

One was started up, due to being moved from the place where the unveiling was 
done - it was clearly a boxer 6 cylinder but was EXTREMEMLY castrated
as far as noise production (and similarity to a 911 motor). It's kind of
raspy in an Italian way. I was dissapointed - I guess most people will be 
throwing
the standard exhaust away in favour of something more "satisfying".

The hardtop looked really good - very co-ordinated in design terms.

The whole car looks very Porsche, same sort of size as a 911 (big next to the
550RS!!!) and has a quality air. The interior is nice, and it generally looks 
better in the flesh than in pictures. 

It's a bit big in my opinion - somthing along the lines of a Lotus
Elise would have been more appropriate.

It's definitely a real porsche and has an incredible "Porsche" feel/look about 
it 
which I can't really put into words, and don't think anybody who has
ordered one will be dissapointed :-) except I can't afford one :-/
(any rich guys out there want to make my son's day :-)

Tschuss
