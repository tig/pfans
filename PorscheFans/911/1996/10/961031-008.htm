 $66 here in Ontario, Canada. Plus renewal, or new registration, is based on
birthdate and calculated on a monthly (I think) basis.

Yeah, but we get to drive our cars ALL YEAR ROUND. We don't own snow tires or
chains, unless we're into alternative sexual lifestyles (yes, it's true, some
people are turned on by snow tires...) We don't have to rinse salt off the
underside (of the cars).

Nobody in California will ever say "hey, I found this really great, low
mileage, 911, been in Canada all its life..."  <g>.

The $1150 or whatever is effectively our "sun tax." Canadians are exempt. 

There was a recent movie on the tube, starring John Candy, about a war
between Canada and the U.S. The U.S. propaganda machine was letting off
one-liners like "Do you want YOUR children to live in a country where it's
winter 11 months of the year?" The ultimate irony of course is that John
Candy, the American hero of the film, was, uh, dare we say it, Canadian.

>Yikes.  Is that the only fee you pay on the vehicle each year, or are
there also property taxes on vehicles in CA.  My state registration
(SC) costs $34/year, but we also have a county property tax based on
vehicle value.  My  '88 Cabrio is about $400/year property tax....If it
were  combined registration fee and property tax, $1150 would be a
little more tolerable.   Your still getting screwed, as that would
mean a pretty insane property tax rate.

Here in CA, that's the whole nine yards. At least in my county/city there are
no additional taxes on the car beyond the state reg fees. Don't know about
any other municipalities. But tax is tax and they take as much as they think
they can get away with.

who grew up in Chicago but got tired of the rust, the salt, the snow, the
rain, the glare ice, shoveling the stuff, etc. and now happily pays $50 a
year for his driver 356 registration in CA.
