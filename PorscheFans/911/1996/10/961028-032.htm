Bryan:
Well if there is one thing I _have_ learned in trying tire/wheel
fitments on various 911s over the years, is that there is only one way
to do it, and that is to measure the car your planning the fitment for.
It seems like there is enough differences in 911s that what works for
one may very well _not_ work on another.  A great example, is your
example.  I too have an '84 and I had the same set up of 225/50s and
245/45s on 7 & 8 x 16s.  These were R1 BFGs and I had about the same
camber as you and had rolled the front fender lips.  Coming off the bank
at the end of the straight at TWS into turn one you're doing, what,
maybe 100mph?  When I hit the transition between the bank and the road
course the front right contacted the outer lip, pulling the rolled lip
out and putting major cuts in the outer shoulder of the tire.  I ended
up taking a low line the rest of the day to avoid the compression of
that line.  I now use 7s & 8s x 15 w/ 225/50 all around.  The side
benefit of this size is improved acceleration and (IMHO) better overall
gearing for the track.

Say Hi to Paul, Jay, Chris (aka: grid bitch), Jeff & the rest of the LSR
gang for me....
