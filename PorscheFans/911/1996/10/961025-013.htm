Snip

While reading this, I noticed that the author refers to 30 US legal 959s
produced at the end of the run. I have never read this before, so I doubt
its veracity, although it would explain a great many things, like the 959
that was for sale in AutoWeek a few months back. I was wondering if anybody
knows some cold hard facts about this situation: is it true? How did they
get the cars past DOT? Were they street legal, or only "importable for
racing"?


Hi Nick,

These 30 cars were indeed ordered by Holberts.  They were special order "S" 
cars with cages and such.  Only seven (on second thought, I think it was 
eight) were delivered, but they were sent back to Europe because of the 
registration problems.  I can't remember, but there was a mixture of red and 
I think white cars.  There are a couple of pictures laying around somewhere, 
if I can find them I will report on the specifics.  I must say it was pretty 
cool seeing these 959's sitting with their 962 out in the parking lot.

Later,

Mike Andrews
