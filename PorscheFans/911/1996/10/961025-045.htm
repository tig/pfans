Hi Rob,

Can I add more to the tire size thread?

I get an opportunity to look at a variety of cars at our track events, and 
at times can even remember some of the stuff that I see.

If memory serves me, I have seen a couple of different cars (Carerra's and 
C2's) with 235 - 275's on them.  The last car that I remember looking at, 
had a set of HRE wheels and he commented that there was no clearance 
problems at all.  I do not remember what width wheels he was running.

I assume you are looking at AVS intermediate's (by the tire size), they 
(Yokahoma) make a real nice brochure that has technical data (diameters) for 
all of their tires.  I vaguely remember that the 275/35  was about a half 
inch shorter that the stock size and the 275/40 was about 3/4 of an inch 
taller than the stock size, but they also make the 235 in a 40 series as 
well as the 45 series.  So you should be able to come up with an appropriate 
set.

Now that I have rambled on, I guess I can't add any info on what will work 
as it pertains to the four wheel drive, other than the standard "keep the 
tire diameters the same".  But, I can tell you that those tires sizes will 
fit under your fenders if you want to go with them.


Good Luck

Mike Andrews
