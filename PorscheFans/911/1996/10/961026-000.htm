Interesting...I always thought that once your vanity plate was stolen/lost
you couldn't get a replacement because the DMV didn't want 3 copies of the
plate floating around lest some scoundrel use it for illegal porpoises. I
read this in the newspaper some years ago, when the Niners were playing in
Stanford, I believe it was. Somebody had the plate GO NINERS, it was stolen
as a souvenir, and reported in the Human Interest section of the newpaper
that they wouldn't get to replace it for the reasons above. Hmmmm, once
again, investigative reporting at its most accurate finest.
