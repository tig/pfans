I used one last winter on my 993. I think it worked very well. To get
around the hood opened problem, I disconnected the switch on the hood
latch mechanism.  There is a connector in the two wires to the switch
about 6 inches from the swith, and it is easily unplugged.  The current
put out by these things is very low, I cannot remember what the number
was, but I could check it for you. I think it was less than 75 ma., not
much more than the resting current drawn by the electronics in the car. 
There was no indication  that the battery even got warm, let alone passed
gas.

The unit I have is labeled "Guest", and I bought it at a marine supply
store, but the ones I have seen elsewhere look just the same.


Regards
Tom Smith
