  Is it worth the money?
  Also, any opinions on polishing vs. chrome?<<



Thomas,

A lot of the answers depend on what you want from the car.

From an all out performance standpoint the 7's and 9's would be the best of 
the two options you specified (eights on the front would be even better). 
 If you were looking from the esthetics end, there is not a lot of visual 
difference between the 8's and 9's.  As I stated earlier, what your are 
after is very important.

You have to be the judge as to whether it is worth the money.  It is 
definitely a good improvement.

Chrome or polish?  Again, what are you going to be doing with your car? 
 Where do you live?  Are you going to be driving your car all year round 
(snow), or are you one of the guys who believes that P-cars aren't meant to 
be driven except on perfect days.  Chrome is certainly easier to keep shiny, 
but can lead to problems when driven in snow (salt).  A slightly damaged 
polished wheel might be repaired easier, but you have to be willing to keep 
after the polished wheel. There are many other issues that I am sure will be 
addressed in following posts.

Many years ago, ok twelve years ago, I did a similar update by going from 
6's and 7's to 7's and 8's.  I stayed with the 205's and 225's.  The wheels 
were finished with polished lips and spokes, and the background painted red 
to match the car.  The car felt better (crisper) in the turns and a little 
better under braking.  The biggest improvement was in the way the car 
looked.  It was a daily driver and at the time I didn't know what a track 
event was.  Given the same situation, I would do the same thing over again.



Good luck,

Mike Andrews
