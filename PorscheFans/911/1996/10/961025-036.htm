Does anyone have experience of putting 215 X 45 X 17's in the front 
of a C4 vs. 205 x 50's when matched with 255 x 40's in the rear?  If 
so, which is the preferred set up?  
Also, does anyone know if there are any clearance problems putting 
275 x 35 x 17's on the rear of a stock '90 C4 mated to 9.5 in. wheels?
     
     
Thanks,
Rob

        Rob:

        As you may already know, with a C4, it's crucial that the diameters of 
the front and rear tires be virtually identical.  Within the last two weeks, 
Ezra Goldman posted a very useful chart, showing the diameters of all of the 
relevant tires sizes - you should get a copy of it.

        Now, to your specific question, I have a '90 C2 Cab with 17' 993 wheels,
so I recently went through this analysis.  My first reaction to your post is 
confusion.  I've never seen 17 inch tires in either 215/45 or 275/35 sizes.  If 
a manufacturer makes them, the sizes I'm familiar with are 205/50, 225/45, 
234/45, 245/45, 255/40 and 275/40 (and larger, but not relevant here).  Not all 
tire companies make all sizes, so you need to decide which tires you want.  Once
you do that, my understanding is that 225/45's will fit on the front, but might 
you might need to roll the fender a bit.  235/45's will also fit under the same 
conditions.  I don't know about 245/45's.  As for the rear, I think 275/40's 
will fit, maybe again with some fender rolling.  But, you don't want to much of 
a size gap between front and rear, or you will induce even more understeer.  If 
you get 275/40's in the rear, I wouldn't go any smaller than 235/45's in the 
front.  If you go smaller than that in the front, go with the 25/40's in the 
rear.

        I'm sure others will also have helpful (assuming mine were) comments.
