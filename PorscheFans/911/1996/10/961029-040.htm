Hi gang,
     
I have a 90 C2 and have been extremely happy with it. It does everything 
you want it to do better than you thought it would. I personally couldn't 
care for the pop-up, pop-down mickey mouse tail fin... but that's me...
     
I want to hear from people that have owned both 87-89 Carreras and C2's how 
they compare. I must admit I like the older Carreras a lot, they just don't 
make cars like that anymore, but I'd like to know from owners if there's a 
base for getting an older one over a C2 (other than money) or is it just 
nostalgia?
     
thanks in advance,
     
Spiro

        Spiro:

        I don't literally fit into the definition of people from whom you want 
to hear, but I'm pretty close.  I presently own a '90 C2 Cab, which I bought 
used in March, '96 with 8800 miles on it.  In September, '85, I bought an '85 
Carrera Targa new.  I actively time trialed it in '86 and '87 and kept it until 
October, '89, when a 77 year old woman in a '77 Cadillac that was 77 feet long 
did quite a job on it.

        Anyway . . . my '85 was pretty similar to the '87's through '89's, 
except that the later Carreras had 214 hp to my 200 (due, I understand, to a 
different chip) and had the G50 gearbox instead of my 915 box (the G50, btw, 
IMHO, is far superior to the 915).  The C2 is a better car, if for no other 
reason than the 3.6 liter twin plug engine, which has more hp (247 vs. 214) and 
more torque down low (although it's still no Corvette!).  I also like the 
suspension better, and the trailing throttle oversteer characteristic inherent 
in 911's has been toned down significantly between my old '85 and the C2.  I 
also like the thermostatic ventilation controls more, although they may have 
been similar in the '87's through '89's.

        On the negative side, I've heard about oil leaking from the heads of the
early C2/C4 engines, but my car now has 19,000 miles on it, and I've had no 
problem yet (knock on wood!).

        In summary, I like my C2, and prefer it significantly over my old 
Carrera.  Of course, I'm sure I'd prefer a 993 even more, but I'm kind of laying
in wait for the 996 to come out next fall.  We'll have to see how the old 
finances are doing and whether I can keep my wine purchases at only a crazy 
level, as opposed to completely insane (the reason I stopped racing in '88 - 
yeah, I know, I'm a wuss!).
