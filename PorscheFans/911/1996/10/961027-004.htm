Not being able to demonstrate my car to my father, who owned many 
German cars before going Japanese because of a bad Audi back in '76, I 
allowed he and my brother (944T owner) to take it out for a spin.  He 
had never experienced a 911 before and was eager to get in and try it 
out.  Unfortunately, it was the family's itinerary for the day that 
kept me from being the initiator.  So, off they went.

When I had gotten back from where I was off to all curious about how he 
liked it, I was met with "Gee, I think there's an engine problem, and 
your older brother thinks so too."  That's it, no other comment....at 
all?  This wasn't the feedback I expected, especially considering they 
both knew I had my sleeves up rebuilding it from the connecting rod 
small ends up, last March.  So, naturally I asked him to detail the 
sounds he heard.  I got, "A grinding noise".  After I asked them and 
was told this was happening while on the throttle somewhere in the 
lower RPM's,  I, foolishly feeling that embedded urge to satisfy ones' 
father without being too defensive, suggested the noises which they had 
heard were coming from the transmission and that they were lugging the 
engine.  His response to this was deaf.

I don't think it's worth the energy to explain anything more to the 
ingrate, but I am curious if someone could elaborate on these noises 
which, I'd swear, I've read about on the list before.  They were once 
described as being characteristic of the G50 transmission under 
heavy/full throttle at between 1000-3000RPM.  What transmission 
components are making the noise (it only happens in 2-4th gears)?  I 
haven't had the car (100+Kmi old) for long, do the noises get worse 
over time?  The transmission has Ltd slip and will be getting Swepco 
oiled soon with a special additive for limited slips from Ford.

Thanks
