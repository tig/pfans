I just finished putting a clutch in my SC.  Everyone always told me that 911
clutches were just heavy, so I never though anything of it.  But now that I'm
done, I can't believe the difference.  I feel like I'm shifting a VW bug.
 Maybe I did something wrong?  But I don't think so, since the car shifts
more smoothly than ever before.

I know that mine was getting stiffer & stiffer right before the change, and
had a feeling of binding during actuation.  When I got everything apart, I
had some scoring on the release bearing sleeve which seemed to be the binding
culprit.  I ended up needing quite a few parts that I didn't intend on
replacing (new seals & stuff like that).  So make sure you leave enough down
time in case you need to order stuff.
