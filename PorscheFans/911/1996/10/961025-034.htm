Scott et al.,

	Whenever you take the fuel filter out of the line, or open up the 
fuel line at all, you introduce air.  My Haynes manual does not explain 
why it is bad to have air in the fuel line when you start the car (I 
assume it could lead to backfiring, failure to start, otherwise messing 
up the mixture, causing a varnish clog or something similarly 
undesirable).

	To bleed the fuel line and distributor:  1. Take out the air 
filter element.  2. locate a curved lever inside the air box, towards the 
front of the car, on the upper surface between the center and right side 
of the car.  This lever should move up easily.  It is part of the airflow 
sensor on the throttle body, and controls the fuel injection rate in the 
KJettronic.  3. Turn on the ignition (to run the fuel pump).  Push up on 
the lever, you should hear a hissing sound.  Hold the lever up for 5 
seconds, or until the hissing sound changes pitch (that's the point the 
air is expelled and fuel is being sprayed). 4. Release the lever, turn 
off the ignition, and put the air cleaner back together.

	I took it on faith that this was proper procedure, and when I 
followed it, my 911S started right up, ran fine, and the problems that 
lead me to change the filter were gone.

	Good luck,

	Bob Didner

<<Bob,

I just took Bruce Anderson's 911 tune up class and he did not mention
anything about "bleeding the injector distributor" after we replaced the
fuel filter.  We just unbolted the old and bolted in the new. Can you
explain to me why this is needed?

Thanks!

        I had similar symptoms with my '76 911S.  Though not as bad as
yours.  Sounds like you may be running lean.  Possibilities are fuel pump
or a clog someplace.   My 911 also started stalling and starving after
running about 15-20 minutes.  Turned out to be a clogged fuel filter.
Even if it's something else, its a relatively inexpensive thing to try
that won't do any harm,  (just remember to bleed the injector distributor
after changing the filter, instructions are in your Haynes manual, if you
have one, if not mail back to me and I'll try to explain the procedure,
it's not hard).

        Good luck,
