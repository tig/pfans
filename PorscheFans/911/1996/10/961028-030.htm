Kevin et al,

Yes, Kevin, my old 944S did make the noise, as did another I had test 
driven before buying it.  It is slightly different with the 911, 
though, more low pitched, same RPM's.  I'd believe it if someone said 
it was the unused gearsets, especially considering I only get it in the 
middle gears.  I don't remember ever getting it in 3-5th in the 944.

The fearful thing is that in this case it is some kind of wear that 
will eventually need shimming or something to prevent a failure.  I 
don't know if the noise will get, or is getting worse.  It may be key 
to note that when doing the rebuild, I lost about half a pint of lube 
(smaallll puddle) from the gearbox after removing a support bracket 
that attaches the engine/transmission.  I'll wait for other responses 
and report back if filling it with Swepco (en route) quites things 
down.  

The stuff about my dad was just venting:)  I don't know how many of us 
have this kind of parent.  Uggg!
