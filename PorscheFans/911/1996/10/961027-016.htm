My name is Rich Brown, I live in the Newark Delaware area. I have an '85
Carrera Targa. I don't know if you're willing to travel the 50 miles or
so to this area, but I take my car to Harry Hall. He lives near the Fair
Hill State Park area outside of Elkton, Md. Harry is a Professor at the
University of Delaware and an expert on 911's. He has his own small
building on his property and does his work there. I find him extremely
reasonable, and knowledgeable. If you are a member of PCA, look on the
last page of Pano at the PCA personnel contributors under special
appointments. You'll find Harry's name as the national technical advisor
for club racing. He preps cars for racing and attends the club races
around the country in that capacity.
I think you would find the drive up here worth while. This spring he
rebuilt my transmission, put in a clutch, and new half shafts. I have my
major services done by Harry.I have no financial interest in his
business--but I'm a satisfied customer. His firm is ECI Motorsports and
can be reached at 410 398-8784.
