This got me to thinking, now that I'm in the mood to trade up.....Not to
start a flame war or nuthun', but $29K for a '79 930, Euro no less, in
"good" condition, seems way high. I've seen many decent Euro model 930's in
California sell for $17K to $25K.

My '87 930, in close to concours condition (it has trophied in Street class
many times), with less miles, was recently appraised at a similiar
amount...also, two Porsche dealers only offered the same (on a '96 C4S trade
in). Even after adding 20% or so to these appraisals, it seems that an '87
would be worth (much) more? 

Anyone can provide me with feedback (or want to buy a cherry '87, for MORE
than $29K)?
