List Members,

I would like to move my 7X16 Fuchs & 225 x 50's to the front, and add 8x16 &
245 x 45s to the rear of my 84 Carrera.  Performance products is selling an
after
market Fuchs look a-like for $262 each.  Does anyone have any experience
with these alloys?  What would a set of used Fuchs (8x16) set me back.  My
concern with buying used, unseen wheels is possible damages, bends,
trueness, etc.

Am I in danger of being struck by lightning for even "thinking" about
putting a Japanese (yipes) wheel on das porsche?? 
Just two days ago my mechanic nearly had a stroke and chastized me after he
remembered that I put "Spitfires" in. (BTW) They run very nicely--only
problem has been with the plug ring coming off during plug removal on two
different plugs and requiring that a wire hook be used to remove them from
the plug well.
To which my mechanic said, "Good for ya!  Serves ya right!"


regards and maintaing my sense of humor,

Steve
