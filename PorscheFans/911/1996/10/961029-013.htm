Hi Pat:
I have a 75 and mine had add on air that was dealer installed.  Note I   
say had in that it didn't work that well and the PO took it out.  From my   
experience ( just my 75) the oil pressure would seem to be OK.  There are   
a host of other (mainly engine related) things relative to the 2.7 that   
is in a 75.  In my case I wanted what I got and had a fine time   
overhauling my engine over the course of the summer.  If spinning   
wrenches isn't your bag you might consider another option or have between   
$5K-$7K extra in your piggy bank if someone hasn't already done a major   
overhaul with replacement studs.
Terry
