First thing to try would be some different pads. On my 928 I was getting
pretty bad fade during driver ed events with stock pads and Castrol LMA
fluid. I changed the pads to Performance Friction Carbon Metallic 80, and
the fluid to ATE Blue, and they worked wonderfully well at the driver ed
session last Friday. The pads are OK for the street, no great amount of
squeaking or anything, work satisfactorily when cold, and they work even
better when hot. Of course my car weighs about 1000 pounds more than
yours, but it already has ventilation to the front brakes, and that just
wasn't enough to do the job with stock pads. There are various street/race
pads around besides the ones I ended up with; these were suggested by the
PCA 928 guru.
