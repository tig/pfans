Steve,

I went through exactly the same thing you are going through about 6 weeks ago
with ny 84 Carrera including conflicting information on the net.  I called
Robert Wood himself and wheel enhancement etc.  I instruct for the lone star
region at TWS so I have had the oportunity to look at and drive lots of
Porsches set up for the track.  I basically used that experience to determin
what wheels and tires I would use.    I went with 225 50 16  R1's on the
front and 245 45 16 R1's in the rear for track use.  My car has had the front
fender lips rolled ($50) and undetectable unless you feel up behind the
fender lip.  It has been lowered about 3/4" and has 1.3 degrees of negative
camber in the front with 1.8 degrees in the rear.  Wheels are 16x7 in the
front and 16x8 in the rear all 911 Fuchs.  The car is otherwise stock.  I
have driven at least 3 other cars with this setup.  With 225's in the front,
push is almost nonexistant.  The car handles much better.  The 205's just
don't quite do it.  In a time trial last week I messed up and did a 3/4 turn
spin.  No rubbing.  I have run the car at TWS very hard turning times about 6
secons faster than the same car on street tires and stock wheels.  No
rubbing.  I have driven the car on the street with the R1's on for about a
week.  No rubbing.  

Good luck
Bryan Henderson
