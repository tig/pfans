This may be an old topic, but recently somebody directed somebody to a page
containing "everything you ever wanted to know about the 959 but were
afraid to ask.."

It was http://www.olemiss.edu/~waletail/959.htm

While reading this, I noticed that the author refers to 30 US legal 959s
produced at the end of the run. I have never read this before, so I doubt
its veracity, although it would explain a great many things, like the 959
that was for sale in AutoWeek a few months back. I was wondering if anybody
knows some cold hard facts about this situation: is it true? How did they
get the cars past DOT? Were they street legal, or only "importable for
racing"?

Just wondering if anybody knows the story. I emailed the author of the
page, but have received no response.
