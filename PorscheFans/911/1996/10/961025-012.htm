Steve,

I concur with this.  IMHO, the replicas are unfit for use due to their
inferior strength and weight.  You should, however, be able to buy
used 8x16 Fuchs in good to excellent conditon for $500/pair or less,
very comparable to what the new replicas cost.

Rennsport, in Roswell, Ga, just north of Atlanta, quoted me $500 for a
nice pair of 16x8's last year, and they had several pair in their used
wheel inventory.  They advertise in Pano, and have done an excellent
job repairing and polishing Fuchs for me.  The number is 770-992-9442.
 Rob Rice is the owner, and the person I have dealt with.  No
financial interest, just a satisfied customer.
