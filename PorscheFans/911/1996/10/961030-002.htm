I think it works like this: you pay $XXX dollars for one year of driving,
which is not pro-rated in any way. IOW, if your reg runs from 5/96 -5/97
whether you register in 5/96 or 5/30/97 you're going to pay the same
amount. I think this concept is ludicrous, but then again I also think the
concept of basing car reg on the price of the car is ludicrous. (Why don't
they just call it luxury tax instead of registration?) The penalty is
accrued if the reg fees are late (but of course the car would be
registered) or if you fail to file a non-op. I *think* that if you fail to
file a non-op they assume you've been driving it, and penalties accrue.
However, after a number of years you drop out of the DMV's computer, so if
you just waited another 5 years maybe it wouldn't matter anymore...

Anyway, my guess is that whoever owned the 993 prior to you filed the
non-op before it went to the dealer, thus no penalties. And btw, consider
yourself lucky: I missed my due date by one month exactly (they send it so
far ahead of time that I filed it under the day it was due, and wrote the
month on it as 9/12, but somehow didn't connect that with September until
October rolled around...) and subsequently had to pay $1652 to register my
993, which sucks big time..
