I have a 83 911SC with about 50,000 miles on the second clutch. My
clutches
generally last a long time (the one in by Honda Beater got over 120,000
miles
before I replace it because of an oil leak), but I am picking up the
following 
symptoms:

*	The clutch is getting heavier and heavier over the last 2 seasons. My
wife noticed it more since she has a hard time driving the car now. My
left leg is in good shape now
*	I am picking up a little bit of chatter that was not there before
*	I am at the end of the clutch cable adjustment, although I have not
touched the adjustment at the pedal-cable end yet
*	The clutch cable has less than 10K miles on it

I am willing to drop the engine this winter, and take a look, but it
would we nice to get
the new wisdom on this. I seem to remember that a characteristic of thes
clutches
is they get heavier because the wearing changes the pivot points, and
changes the
mechanical advantages.

However, the clutch is smooth, and other than a little chatter in 1st,
works fine. I 
would hate to take it apart for no reason.

So, what do you think?

Cheers,

Mike
83 911SC
