Saturday morning I worked on the suspension on my 86 911.

Rear trim height lowered to spec from it's previous 1+ inches higher than
spec.
Front trim height lowered to spec from it's previous .5+ inches higher than
spec.
Side to side is now  .13  inches difference.

Procedure in Haynes for rear described removing the riser plate (and
everything else) and adjusting the plate or the torsion bar on the splines.
This car has an adjustable riser plate with a large concentric adjusting nut
on the end near the torsion bar.  (not two alignment bolts at the rear of the
plate)
1.Did Porsche ever do this or is it aftermarket put on by PO?  Haynes says
nothing about adjusting the rear height in this fashion.

2.Since this measurement is a difference between the center of the axle and
the center of the torsion bar, my logic says the trim height should remain
the same no matter what wheel size, correct?

Handling changed. Duh

Now there is slightly more body roll.
The front now seems to roll over things it used to kind of feel like it was
slamming into. (bumps etc.)  Could be my imagination. but I dont think so.
In a tightly rounded street ( highway cloverleaf, i.e.) the steering wheel
used to want to jerk back to straight and required my jerking it back in the
direction I chose to go.  It happened both left and right and no great speeds
  Not my imagination.

3.Can you guys interpret these events and what are these phenononnonommonom
called?

4. Could the front to back weight distribution cause that much difference in
decreased front shock travel or was the angle causing them to work only
minimally?

5.  Good books?

TIA
