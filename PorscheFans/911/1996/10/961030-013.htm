Yikes.  Is that the only fee you pay on the vehicle each year, or are
there also property taxes on vehicles in CA.  My state registration
(SC) costs $34/year, but we also have a county property tax based on
vehicle value.  My  '88 Cabrio is about $400/year property tax.  my
brand new '97 Tahoe (Tow Monster) was also about $400/year.  Both have
an approximate $30k taxation value according to my county.   If it
were  combined registration fee and property tax, $1150 would be a
little more tolerable.   Your still getting screwed, as that would
mean a pretty insane property tax rate.  And, you aren't getting a
full year of use for your full year of tax.  That I would have a major
problem with.  The dealer pays an inventory tax while they own the
vehicle.  The double tax would mean they get paid twice for each
vehicle whenever it is in the possession of a dealer.

Geez, if I had to pay that kind of tax to drive a vehicle, I would 
just sell the Porsche, and drive a Chebbie.  Wait a minute, I'm 
already driving a Chebbie. <G>
