Hi Terry,

Let me add my two cents worth to this discussion.

If you were out to obtain the absolute best run (ET) you could, on each and 
every run, I would suspect that there would be some added stress to your 
car.  If you were simply out to have a good time and were willing to trade 
some of that ET for longevity, you could expect a weekend with no car 
trauma.

If you were willing to drive off the line instead of dumping the clutch, and 
shift gears at or before redline (but at the same point every time) instead 
of full power shifts at the rev limiter you would be able to run very 
consistent times.  Which is what you want to do if you are bracket racing. 
 I have been able to put together series of runs all within .01 of a second 
of each other (13.07 and 13.08's).  On a 13.06 index you can be very 
competitive with that kind of consistency.  The only variable to deal with 
at this time is your reaction time at the lights.

After all, having fun with your car is what all this is about.


Later,

Mike Andrews
