It is correct, isn't it, that when you buy, in CA, a used car that has an 
expired registration, it is the responsibility of the buyer to pay the 
retroactive DMV fees?  (It's understood, of course, that this $burden$ can 
be negotiated as part of the sales terms.)

This happened to me several years ago when I bought an 88 911 from a 
private party.  I also got hit with penalties.  I don't recall the 
circumstances under which penalties can be waived, though I know there are 
some that didn't apply to my situation then.

As further proof that history repeats itself, Part 2 of "Lessons Learned" 
on my wife's used 993 purchase: examine the registration sticker date, 
stupid!  We just found out that the car we bought from a local P-dealer 
this month has been re-registered back to 5/96 at our expense.  I don't see 
penalties -- just a full year's registration ($1150) that covers us only 
until 5/97.

If I'm misinformed someone please straighten me out.  And if someone 
understands DMV penalties (when they apply and when they can be waived) can 
you explain it?  Why weren't we also charged a penalty?

Lance.
