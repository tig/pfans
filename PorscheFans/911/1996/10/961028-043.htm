<< My 1985 911 now has 160K miles. Recently, it has become more 
 difficult to shift out of 5th gear. I understand that 5th gear is 
 "spring loaded" to make disengaging 5th easier. I guess this is no 
 longer working on mine. Has anyone encountered this problem? Is there 
 a simple solution or do I need to think about signing up for Bruce's 
 tranny rebuild class?
 
 Thanks in advance.

Hi Richard,
  Long time no see. If you are refering to the spring that keeps the shift
lever from easily going over to the right (5th and Reverse) then it is
contained within the shift mechanism, and not the transmission (915
transmissions). If it were me I would check all the linkages before I ripped
out the transmission. Also if you have a short shift kit, they seem to get a
little more touchy and harder to get adjusted. That might just be me, though.
  If all of your shift bushings are OK, there is one quick thing to check on
the transmission itself if your shifter is acting balky. There is a small
plate on the bottom of the transmission that can be removed by itself. It
will drain all your fluid out so be ready. The plate has a fork mounted on it
with I think 3 nuts. These do loosen with time and you can fix it by cleaning
it, and tightening the nuts back down with a little blue locktite.
  Take the class anyway and buy a spare to rebuild, that way when it goes bad
all you have to do is swap it. :-)
  Did you make Road Atlanta this year?
