Ted:

I used the stock 915.  Works great.  The linkage, motor mounts are a pain,
also the heat is damn near impossible to fit.  Looks like I'll use some
reducers to get the pipe from the blower to fit with all of those damn
distributors in the way!

Also, I used Patrick's flywheel.  Beware, He is a complete putz.  I spent
weeks waiting for the harness and flywheel, which was "in stock" when I
placed the order.  

Plan on getting some 28mm rear tors bars to make up for the weight
difference.
