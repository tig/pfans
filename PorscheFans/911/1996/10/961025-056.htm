So, what's the most common failure mode for the ignition switch?

Got in my '75 911S this morning, turned the key, lights, fuel pump, 
radio, etc. Won't start...  Several more tries, but the engine wouldn't 
crank--no noise, no dimming of the lights, no nothing.

Good thing the PO installed that big pushbutton under the dash!  Turn the 
key to ON, push the big button, car starts right up.

When I bought the car, I couldn't understand what the big button was
for.  It's wired up to the ignition with nice thick red wires, and
mounted on a little plate screwed into the firewall on the underside of
the dash.  At first I thought it had something to do with the alarm, but
eventually I put things together:  The ignition key didn't match the
door and glovebox locks, and here's this button that duplicates the
ignition switch...  I'll bet that the ignition switch broke, and rather
than fix it, the PO just wired in this big button.  The guy was a total
hack, this is just one of many examples....  But for once I'm thankful.

So anyways, for my curiousity, is this a common failure mode (key works,
but won't start the car)?  Is it gonna deteriorate so I can't even turn
on the car (I'm willing to put up with it and spend my money on go-fast
goodies instead)?  How much of a hassle is it to put in a new ignition
switch?  Do I have to change all my keys, or can I just replace the
switch part without changing the tumbler?
