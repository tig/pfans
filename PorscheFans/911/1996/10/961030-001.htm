Yeah, and I even know what the difference IS... Which makes the 
message I sent last night at 1:30 am even more embarrassing.

Forget everything I said... Or better yet, go back to that message
and replace every occurrence of the word "ducktail" with "wing" or
"really big spoiler"; it'll be accurate then.

For anyone who cares, the ducktail/airdam combination reduces lift
AND drag simultaneously -- a rare case where you can get something
for nothing -- through the following mechanism:

First, the airdam keeps a lot of high-pressure air from getting under
the car.  This is actually the most important part; the ducktail just 
balances the car.

Second, the ducktail creates a high-pressure area over the
rear-window area... This high-pressure area on top of the car DOES
actually provide some downforce (in the same way that big
NASCAR-type rear spoilers do), but the really IMPORTANT thing it does
is create an artificially-high "roofline"; air flowing over the car
will flow above the high-pressure air in front of the spoiler just as
though that dammed-up air were a higher, sleeker rear-window.

Take a lok at the new 911 GT1's "rear window" area... It's much
longer and sleeker than a street 911's.  The dammed-up air in front
of a ducktail-equipped 911 creates a false surface that provides the
same benefit (although to a lesser degree, of course).

If the ducktail is too tall, the turbulent air behind it will create
a lot of drag (and the message I posted last night will accurately
describe the situation).  If the ducktail's properly sized, though,
the drag caused by the turbulence is countered by the fact that flow
separation over the car is delayed by the false surface in front of
the ducktail.

P.S.  I just read over this message, and I can see that it isn't real 
      clear... Sorry, but it's even later now (2:30 am) than it was
      when I wrote last night's message.  Oh, well...
