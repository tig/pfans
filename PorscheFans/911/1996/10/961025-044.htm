I swear I've done nothing wrong except for a pretty much straight exhaust.  I live in the county patrolled by Sherrifs(they're cool), but as soon
as I go about a mile and get into Tustin, I would pick up my Police
esdcort until I either got pulled over or left town.  My friends that
have fixed up Chevys get followed to pretty much, but I've never seen
one of those Hondas(where the big shiny exhaust adds about 10 horsepower, the yellow PIA lights advertise that they got a race car and the custom
rims must cut a few tenths offf their 1/4 time) pulled over and they're
out here street racing!  I've never smoked, drinked, used drugs, ran
with the wrong crowd plus I'm clean cut.  The cops in Tustin just don't
like teenagers!  A friend of mine got a ticket for not stopping long
enough at a Stop Sign plus the usual speed trap tickets they have here. 
They pulled over my mom one time in the 72 911 because it is inly in his
name and hers wasn't added.  So they called in the CHP 5.0, about 6
Tustin cruisers plus a helicopter in case she "ran."  The only way I
used to break the law was my exhaust, just because I liked the sound and
performance of it.  I learned real quick though that I can't go ripping
about Tustin because then they literally will wait for me around the
corner.  I need to move, because this town sucks, I've never had a
problem outside of Tustin except for my cruising ticket and that was an
area of a lot of weekend cruisers(we were going fishing, except they decided to close the jetty)
