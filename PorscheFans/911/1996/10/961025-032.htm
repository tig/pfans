To add more speculation to the thread:

I understand that photo radar requires a front plate since the
radar camera takes a picture of your car and requires a clean
shot of the person driving and the license tag.  If either the
face of the driver or the license plate do not appear clearly
in the picture, they can't send the "invoice" for safety services
rendered (sarcasm mode off).

On a related note, this happened to me early this year:
(paraphrased from my original post on pfiles)

Driving to the Bay Area from Seattle in 1-505 between 80 and 5.
I am in a group of 3 and all of us going "briskly".

CHP appears in my mirror way back approaching *very fast*.
I am the trailing car in the group and thus the target.
I downshift radically to scrub off speed without flashing
brakelights.  CHP eventually catches up and  pulls me over.

CHP:	"You were going awfully fast.  I'd estimate about 90mph.
	Are you in some kind of hurry"

ME:	"Actually I was just focused on keeping up with traffic".

CHP:	"Are you sure your speedo isn't broken?  You were really going
	 fast."

ME:	(on serious adrenaline buzz, somehow manage not to admit guilt).

CHP:	"I notice you are missing your front plate.  What would you
	 prefer: a ticket for 90+ or a fix it ticket for that plate"?

ME:	"Is that a trick question?"

CHP:	"It's kind of an IQ test".

ME:	"I believe I would prefer the fix-it ticket".

So I got the plate, got the ticket waived, and took the plate back off.
Not having the plate did not save me.  Him not getting a clean fix
and me not admitting guilt saved me.  The lack of a front plate just
gave him an out, IMHO

YMMV.
