Phans:

Here it is almost Halloween and I was sitting on the back porch plotting
this year's leaf war strategy while watching the leaves float down. As I
detest this annual ritual, my mind turned to more interesting problems. I
got to wondering about whether the new 911 GT1's will be entered at
Datona and Sebring along with perhaps the McLarens-or even the LeMans
winning TWR WSC cars. I've read with interest any article I could find
about IMSA being sold and anticipitated policy changes-however vague and
speculative. At this late date, I would think that any world class teams
who were planning an American Campaign in the coming season would have
put out the publicity announcements accordingly. Has anyone heard any
news on this subject? 

And how about the Boxters? Has the factory any plans to race these
jewels? Are there any customer racers planning a campaign? If so, in
what racing series. I would expect them to appear in the PCA club
racing--how about the SCCA or IMSA or any other series?
