>>"Porsche 911 Story" by Paul Frere
>>"The rear spoiler, which increases the rear wheel grip by no less than 20
percent at the car's maximum speed, has the additional advantage that,
combined with the front air dam, it moves the center of pressure back... with
a resultant noticeable decrease in the car's sensitivity to side winds. This
is further decreased by the fact that the air dam and rear spoiler
combination also reduces the tendency for the lift to increase in side winds.
It is also noteworthy that the aerodynamic aids result in a front/rear lift
ratio of 45/55, almost exactly matching the car's weight distribution -- an
deal state of affairs."<<

The 'duck tail' is only part of the solution, while the front air dam/spoiler
is an important part of the formula as well.  Used in conjunction you have
the whole result.
Unless you want to put a duck tail on just for appearance sake, use the front
air dam at the same time to enhance both stability and road holding
performance.

Recently at a P.C.A. track event I toured the paddock and looked closely at
911's with 'duck tails'.  I noticed many repop units had the same malady,
cracking at the lower edge, outside -where the tail meets the lid.  If you
drew a line from the tip of the duck tail lip down toward the body of the car
-the deck lid itself- the cracks started at that juncture.
All of them had a common theme, chopper fiberglass construction.  Of the six
or eight I looked at, two didn't have the front air dam.
There was one original RS car and the owner/operator told me he had over 128K
miles on it.  There were no cracks or blemishes in his 'duck tail' (and,
needless to say, his car had the front air dam.)

I'm not saying the air dam is the difference, read on.
Hand laid fiberglass differs from the 'chopper' method by being stronger and
more durable.  My first lesson was on a boat hull, but has graduated to very
sophisticated applications of carbon fiber materials in high performance
autos and aircraft.  Chopper is cheap and useless, unless strictly for the
'look'.
If you want it to work, use hand laid or pre-preg.  The last thing you want
to happen is failure at speed.  Dramatic changes in the envelope tend to have
equally dramatic results, and they usually occur in an instant.
Hand laid application of the woven materials provides the best application of
the technology - light in weight yet strong.

Gary Kempton, owner of Made By Hand, makes a quality reproduction of the
original 'duck tail', as well the front air dam/spoiler.  Bruce Anderson
recently discussed these things in an article in Panorama, as well here on
PFans.
Contact Made by Hand directly at 904/926-5722.

[As it should be said, I get nothing out of this.  I've known Gary for
approximately 25 years.  He makes a great product.  My endorsement is
strictly for that reason.]
