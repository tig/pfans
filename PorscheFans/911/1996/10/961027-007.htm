Stephen,

I had to redo a number of items on my (now gone) '73 RSR replica about 10
years ago....if you aren't looking for EXACT concours quality matching
textures/finish, then Rustoleum Satin Black works great and lasts a long
time. I did the wiper arms, window frames, F/R windshield trim, door
handles, oil cooler mesh, engine cover grill, etc. and it still looks great.

If you want a concours type finish, then Wurth makes a product (Wurth Matt
Black) that works great, but costs alot more and requires access to spray
equipment. You can get it from:

        Larry Reynolds
        Car Care Specialties, Inc.
        Distributors of Quality Car Care Products
        Post Office Box 535
        Saddle Brook,  NJ  07663-0535
        Phone (201) 796-8300
        Fax (201) 791-9743
        E-mail carcaresp@aol.com

Larry provided some info on refinishing wheels a while back - I'll forward
that to you directly. For the wiper arms, and related small stuff, I just
scuffed up the old paint with a fine grade of 3M Scotchbrite pads, wiped
down with Acryli-clean, and sprayed with Rustoleum out of a spraycan (note:
this stuff works best when the OAT is 70 degrees or better, plus warm up the
can by immersing in warm water first - also make sure the parts are warm, or
this paint will orangepeel badly).

One other note - the refinished parts will make the rest of the car look
old/dull - and you'll have to redo everything else! Oh well.
