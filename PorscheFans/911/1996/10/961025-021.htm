Why not? Except for demolition derby, you might as well enjoy
your 911 in every way possible.

No, you should be well in to the 13s in Elapsed Time with a modified
3.0 in an early car. I don't know about the elevation difference though.

Why not? I, Scott Jessen, and lots of other 911 drivers run dozens 
of drag race starts at each pro solo with no problems. You
may break a CV joint but if so it needed replacing anyway ;-).
My 110,000+ mile joints have survived over 200+ drag race type starts
including autocross starts and I've never even repacked the outer joints.

> What I am trying to figure out is how much power this engine is producing.

Even if you launch easy, the trap speed will indicate your horsepower.
With your slow 14.6, 97 MPH is quite good. I'd guess that you 
have about 190HP with that speed. But a 3.0 with webers and early
exhaust should be a bit over 200HP if tuned right I think. Maybe
it's the lack of O2 at that elevation or the Webers are not tuned for that
elevation.

My stock 72S weighs 2470 with me in it, and with 190 HP is under
14 seconds at just over 100MPH (with 205/50/15 tires which help a lot).

What were your 60 foot times? With that time
I can guess at your time with a good start by using my starting
times. With a good start (under 2.0 for 60') you should get over 
100MPH too.
