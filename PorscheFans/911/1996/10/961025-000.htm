On the other hand, appearing in court for one of those offenses DOES
give you the opportunity to stand up and say, "I was doing 30 in a 25
MPH zone!  Geez... You don't have to make a Federal case out of it."

Anyway, thanks for the clarification, Vince.  My sister, who used to
prosecute cases for the US District Attorney in San Francisco, agrees
that bail forfeitures are never reported to the DMV, but she claims
that, at least in her office, there was some leeway in reporting
convictions.  Perhaps the policy varies from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction.
