    Good point, Ted... 205/50 tires (assuming equal wheel diameters)
    drop the car about an inch lower than 185/70s.  Lower's better,
    so a factory front spoiler on a car with low-profile tires mill
    be more effective than the same spoiler with tall tires.

    I have no proof that the factory-spoiler-and-short-tires
    combination is any better or worse than the airdam-and-tall-tires
    combo, but I'd suspect that the airdam's probably a little more
    efficient at moving air to the sides.

    Also -- I'm no 911 expert, so this may be wrong -- the airdam
    has space for a front-mounted oil-cooler, so that's an additional
    advantage over the factory spoiler.

    Oh, and before you ask... Whether you use an airdam or a spoiler,
    its effectiveness will be reduced if you angle it by mounting
    different-sized tires on your left- and right-front wheels.
