How can I tell what gears are in my tranny and rear-end assuming the tranny 
was not modified?  Is there a code which specifies what rear-end is in 
there?   Reading from my '74 owner's manual (since I can't find my little 
spec book), the final drive is given as a 7/31 not the more common 8/31? 
  Can anyone confirm the 7/31 was standard issue for '74?

Also gear ratios are listed as follows:
1    11/35     3.182:1
2    18/33     1.834:1
3    23/29     1.261:1
4    27/25     0.926:1
5    29/21     0.724:1

Can anyone confirm this?   It tough to calculate speed in various gears at 
certain rpm for different tire sizes without the above info.   I believe my 
speedo reads a little high and I'm trying to figure how fast (or slow) I'm 
actually going and what the effects are on changing tire sizes.

p.s. it's amazing how much useful info you can find in the owner's manual.

TIA,
