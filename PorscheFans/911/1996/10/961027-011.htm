Hello PorscheFans,
	I haven't written you guys for awhile, I guess because I haven't 
had any problems...until now.
	I was cruising in my '69 911T on a straight road coming home from 
work when the oil guage slowly drops and the big red idiot light comes 
on.  Instinctively I shut off the engine as soon as I saw the light.  I 
pulled over and had a freind tow it to my uncle's barn where it now 
sits.  
	I've never had this happen before...is my engine toast??!!!  
Hopefully I shut it off before serious damage occured.  It didn't make 
any funny noises.  What is the first step to take to figure out what the 
problem is?  Could be an oil pressure sender malfunction or loose wire, 
but how can I test it when running my engine might ruin it?  How can I 
see if the engine really has oil pressure?  
	I sure hope it's the sending unit or a loose wire, an engine 
rebuild doesn't sound appetizing right now...thanks for any suggestions!
