Steve:

No, but the aftermarket replicas aren't NEARLY as strong as the real
thing.  The Fuchs alloys are forged, so they'll bend on impact.  The
aftermarket replicas are cast, so they'll tend to shatter, instead. 
The replicas also look subtly different from the real wheels.

I see used 8" Fuchs for between $600 and $800 a pair.  That's a
little more than what the replicas cost, but remember that Fuchs
alloys are some of the best wheels on the planet... It seems sorta
silly to replace them with cheap-ass American Eagle, Fortran or A5
replicas.

If you buy your used wheels from someplace like the Pano Classifieds, 
I don't think you'll need to worry about them being damaged.  Pano's 
ad policy is:

    Unless expressly stated to the contrary in the copy submitted,
    the following conditions as to sale and purchase pertain:

    a. The quoted or offered price includes delivery.

    b. The item is suitable for use without rework.  Repaint may be
    needed, rechrome will not be needed.

    c. The item will be shipped within 9 days of order.

    d. If the buyer is not satisfied with the item, the price or
    deposit will be returned upon rejection and return within 10
    days of receipt provided the item is in the same condition as
    received.  Expense of return is on the buyer.  The buyer waives
    all other rights.

Personally, neither I nor anyone I know has ever had any problems
buying through the Pano Classifieds.

P.S.  By the way, you might want to rethink your idea to put 245/45
      tires on the new 8-inch wheels while leaving the 225/50s on the
      old 7-inchers... You may end up with a NARROWER contact patch
      than if you remounted your current front tires (205/55, I
      assume) on the 7-inch wheels and moved your current 225/50 rear
      tires to the new 8-inch wheels.
