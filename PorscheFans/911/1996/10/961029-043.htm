Porsche Fans bear with me I am in the process of purchasing a 911.
Currently I am looking at a '75 911 with low miles for under 8000.      I am 
brand new to the Porsche game.  Was there factory AC in 75?     The oil 
pressure gage reads almost zero at idle.  At 2000 rpm almost    20 pounds. 
Is this normal? Thanks in advance, Pat Walker

        Pat (using Robert Cato's email address!):

        This isn't what you're asking about, but I thought I'd throw in some 
info regarding the vintage of 911 you're looking at.  The very first 911 I owned
was a '75S (of course, all of the 911's in '75 were S's), and it had one very 
significant problem, as did the later '74's, 76's and 77's: in order to meet 
emissions requirements, Porsche put on heat exchangers, which sit underneath of 
the engine.  The problem is that these things get incredibly hot, and have a 
tendency to melt (warp) the bottom end of the engine (cylinders).  At least I 
was told that's what was wrong with mine.

        Something to think about.  I'll be interested to see if other, more 
knowledgeable, list members echo my concern, or tell you (and me) that I'm 
crazy.
