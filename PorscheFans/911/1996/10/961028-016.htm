Tess:

I probably should have included a YMMV disclaimer on my last post...
But again, this may be a combination of the track and how aggressively
you drive.  I have never seen SIR, so I have no idea on what that track
is about.  I do know that PIR has two significant long sections that, if
aggressive enough, you will have your car well over 100 mph, both of
which lead to 2nd gear turns.  This took some brakes on my car.  Also,
if you are aggressively following other cars, you will need to hover the
ol' left foot over the brake pedal.  I find that most of the drivers I
catch are because I'm out braking them and executing turns a bit better,
not because the 125K mile bone stock Carrera motor is out pulling them,
so when I'm riding someone's tail I tend to brake a lot more.  Also,  If
you aren't accelerating as much in the straights, you don't need as much
braking for the turns, so that's why my comment on the aggressiveness of
your driving.

I don't know how long PIR is, but frankly I am surprised at how little
response your questions have raised from other list members -- I figured
we surly would have some PIR experts around to give us more insight, on
track tips as well as tips for PIR.  Maybe if we included a few lines on
whether or not you run a front plate on the track and get black flagged
very often  -- yeah, that would get some comments!!  vbg here!!  ;-)

By the way,  Buttonwillow was a blast -- the turn they seem to call "the
NASCAR" is up there on the pucker scale!  (though they ought to try out
TWS to see what a REAL NASCAR turn is about (can you say 8 lanes of
banked pavement? I thought you could...).  We ran the track counter
clockwise (backwards to it's design, as I understand) so it made for
some interesting turns, like the top of 4th gear decreasing esses
(getting tighter) leading to a tight entrance left hand sweeper.  My
video shows 120mph through the fist two esses (yeeehaaa!!)...

That's all for now, hope to hear back how your runs at PIR go, and as
the saying goes: keep the shiny side up!
