My $.02... 
 
I have an 88 Targa, very happy with it. 
 
I think the major changes after 88 was the move away 
from T-bars to coil overs and ABS system/ Air Bags. 
 
I don't remember when the 3.6 came out but that could be a factor 
for going with a newer car.  
More power, something we are all looking for.  
 
Money was an Issue when I got the car almost 3 years ago. 
But you would never guess that with the amount of money I have  
put into her. (Being picky cost you money. ) You know the line 
"while you are there go ahead and replace all that other stuff too." 
 
I think the 88 was a good year for stability nothing new 
was introduced into the mix from 87. The G50 had been around for a year 
and works very nice. And yes it does have the clasic look of a 911. 
I think the valve guides are a weak point in these years. 
Per my car and other I have heard require replacement 
early in life (mine around 70K but was prob a problem since  
I got the car with 47k). This has prob been fixed in later models 
but I don't claim to know that for a fact. 
 
I am always surprised as to how much this car can do vs all of the 
other cars I have owned in the past ( Very long list of sports cars.) 
"This is MY last car, I will spend what ever it takes to keep her going." 
( exclude A future Track car ) Same goes for our family car (560SEL) very 
happy with it too. I love German cars. 
 
 
Ok to answer your question older vs newer? 
 
With Porsche cars you are prob better going newer.  
Since in most cases you will prob just end up adding the  
stuff to your older car to get it where the new cars are anyway. 
So why not just let the factory do it for you. But there is  
also a lot to be said for nostalgia!

1988 was a good year for German Cars !

88 560 SEL (Benz) Black/Gray (More comfortable than my living room and 
                              a nicer stereo too)   
 
 
 
In reply to: 
======================================================================= 
I have a 90 C2 and have been extremely happy with it. It does everything 
you want it to do better than you thought it would. I personally couldn't 
care for the pop-up, pop-down mickey mouse tail fin... but that's me... 
 
I want to hear from people that have owned both 87-89 Carreras and C2's 
how they compare. I must admit I like the older Carreras a lot, they just 
don't make cars like that anymore, but I'd like to know from owners if 
there's a base for getting an older one over a C2 (other than money) or is 
it just nostalgia? 
 
thanks in advance, 
 
Spiro
