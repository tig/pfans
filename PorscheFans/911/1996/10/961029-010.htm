Yes Leonard, the market is an objective way to evaluate a car. But one
needs to fragment the market by price ranges. Since not all cars cost
the same, the price variable needs to be factored out. In order to do
this, one needs to compare the sales (in units ) of automobiles in
similar price categories. While the 928 is a great car, it was not a
sales success. A lot of individuals in the market decided that they
would prefer other vehicles in the same price category. Your comments
about the Model T and the 2CV are not relevant to the discussion (unless
their prices are much greater than when I last checked).
