Ok, enough already! Let's drop this non-productive and frankly childish
turf war on who's favorite car is better. I think everyone will agree that
the 911 in just about any of its flavors takes a different set of skills to
push to the limit than a 928. Take John Doe high performance car driver and
put him in a 928 and in short order he will be comfortable at the extremes.
Put the same fellow in a 911 and, unless he is exceedingly careful and
intuitive, he will quickly be in trouble at the edge of the envelope.
Because the 911 is ..(insert your favorite put-down here)? No, because the
paradigm is different. It's a fundamentally different car requiring a
different skillset. Not nessessarily better skills - just different. The
928 never did lend itself to all-out racing in part due to it's extreme
complexity. It was meant to get you from A to B as quickly and in as great
a comfort as possible. This it does in spades.

And now back to our regularly scheduled program...

This being a group devoted to 928 topics, maybe I can get some information
about mine. (1978 Euro).
1) Starts well when cold, but very difficult after having been warmed up
then turned off for 25+ minutes (until cold again). Any ideas? I'm waiting
for a set of manuals, but does this car have a fuel accumulator?

2) Where can a guy get a full listing of parts? I have Tweeks and
Automotion catalogs, but the 928 sections in them leave a lot to be
desired. The word pitiful comes to mind...
