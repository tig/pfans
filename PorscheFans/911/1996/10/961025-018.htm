Hi,


The 959 in South Florida is one of the "S" models sent back to Germany. 
I have only seen a picture of it, but my parents saw it at the shop and
it 
was Red and did have a full cage in it. The car was ordered from
Holberts'
but was sent back. When the owner heard that, he had one of his car
dealerships
in Germany buy the car ship it back to the States. It is now here on
dealerplates.

A funny little story, the owner took the car out to Moroso last spring
and warped
the front brakes a little. He took the car to my mechanic who does the
regular service
and asked him to replace the rotors. So my mechanics calls Porsche and
tells them that he has 
a 959 that needs new rotors. Some inexperienced order taker says that
there are no 959 in the 
US, so my mechanic decides to call a friend at PCNA. So he calls, tells
the person what he 
needs and the person also says there are no 959 in the US. Finally the
mechanic finally says, "look
I have car this 959 Serial #........ and I need rotors. This person at
PCNA confers with some 
higher ups and they realize who the owner is (obviously somebody you
don't want to mess with).  
The next day with my mechanic gets the two rotors for a paltry $1200 per
disk. 

Well the story sounds stupid written, but the way my mechanic says,
makes it really funny.
