We took the Carrera to the AROO time trials at PIR this weekend.
Expecting to be the lone blue rear-engine in a sea of red, we were
surprised to pull into the parking lot and find two P-cars (one of
which was a '74 911 Targa owned by the Alfa club webmaster and chief
tech engineer, and the other a '69 911S which was *all original* - er, 
except for the modifications...) there already, and no Alfas. Soon, other
cars started pulling into the lot:  an '86 Carrera, a slant-nose turbo, a
944, an MR2, 2 Ford Cortinas (one a twin-cam and the other a pushrod, both
driven by 2 brothers), an RS America, a C4, a '74 911S, a Honda Civic,
three or four other 930-series P-cars (one a racer which was hugely fast
and sticky), a couple Datsuns, and my personal favorite:  a 1970 911,
totally pristine and totally original, except for the paint -- which one
could lovingly call a "cooked okra" color.  Finally, Jeff Butler and Tom
Nuxoll pulled their GTV-laden trailers in, followed by a GTV6, Doc
Doolittle's Rubber-Chicken-Brigade GTV, a trick red Giulia Super race-car 
with yellow panasports (it was an eyeful), and I think I might have seen a
Milano.... 

In any case, the Alfa club was very generous in hosting what was
essentially a non-Alfa event!  Some of the Porsche enthusiasts were from
Seattle: Todd Warren and his father (who drove his unusual MuZ?
murderpickle down to watch the event), Darryl Savage, Kim Wolfkill, John
Tilden, and myself.  

The '74 911S was a Porsche Club race car, owned by Jim Coshow -- a
seasoned racer and Pfans digester who GALLANTLY gave up a good portion
of his day to be an instructor for John and me.  Denny Pillar started the
event by leading a parade lap in the red Super, with first-time drivers
following his line at faster and faster speed.  The track was very much
like a Malibu Grand Prix track:  flat (with perhaps 3' of elevation
change in the off-camber back side), lots of grass run-off area, and
the Indy-style colored curbing which gave reliable spotting points for the
turns. I was told the track is very forgiving, because of this setup;
however, I found it to be quite challenging and frustrating to learn.

Jim was an excellent instructor and donated lots of his time to our cause.
Not only did he ride with me several times, but he drove me around in the
911S and also piloted the Carrera.  In the 911S, with very smooth,
Sunday-out-for-a-spin, unaggressive driving, he was turning times
faster than 1:27.  Not stopping at buddy-style training, he used an
opportunity when I was out on the track to hop into the 911s and give me
a run for my money, passing me and leading me around at speed.

By about 2:30, I think I had an idea of the right line to take, although I
felt very hampered by the street tires -- any slip off of the right line
and they weren't holding me very much.  Right before I took my turn with
the timers, someone asked me how fast I was going on the straight, which
started me thinking about speed, rather than time.  (I know this is a
no-no.)  I will admit right here and now that I watched the speedometer on
the straight during my first hot lap ... I made it to 110 .... and then 
I ran out of asphalt for braking into turn 1.  So, I decided to take a
little excursion off into the grass.  (I like to think it was the red
'vette which caught up with me and pushed me off -- oh, yeah, there were
at least 2 Corvettes; he then went off track as well at turn 9 and we all
started over).  In any case, I was slow as molasses in the corners, so my
fastest time (after the run-out) for the 1.9 mile track was 1:41, which
was third slowest!  The fastest Alfa turned a 1:28, and the fastest
non-Alfa turned a 1:18.

Now that I've had a little bit of seat time at PIR, I'll feel more
prepared for Rainbonnet, which comes up this weekend.  We are also
definitely, positively, no-doubt-about-it, absolutely going to run the
A008rsII's and the carbon fiber brakes.  No more 4-wheel slides, please.
(Although I'll admit, it was just like driving in the rain at the Alfa
event at SIR, modulating the steering input with blips of the throttle.  I
had to remind myself I wasn't *at* Malibu Grand Prix; I was in a car worth
a third of my mortgage, and that car belongs to somebody else!)

And oh, by the way:  I found a 912 while I was down there... offer
forthcoming... story later.
