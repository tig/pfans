Yes Lance,

I owned one of these.  It was a '77 2.7.  I had owned it about two weeks 
and one day parked it on a steeply sloped driveway headed "up".  Well 
these particular cars had a little oil mist that condensed in the air box 
when the oil was brim top full.  Maybe a little too full.  There was a 
drip from the corner of the air box that went through the fins of the 
motor and directly on the "heater" converters.  I had noticed a little 
smoke rising from the engine compartment but wasn't very alarmed at the 
time.  For some reason I decided to start looking at the bottom of the 
engine first.  There was a fire going on with the oil drip feeding it.  I 
couldn't do anything about it.  I blew on it to put it out and it spread. 
After thrashing around I managed to find a garden hose and put it out.

I never again ran the oil full to the brim on that car.  I was always 
careful about that drip that would appear at the air box.  

Later I received a factory recall for renewing some hoses that were in 
the vacinity of the air box.  The reason was that they would catch fire.
