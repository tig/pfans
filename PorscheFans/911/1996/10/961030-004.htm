<<  This isn't what you're asking about, but I thought I'd throw in some 
 info regarding the vintage of 911 you're looking at.  The very first 911 I
owned
 was a '75S (of course, all of the 911's in '75 were S's), and it had one
very 
 significant problem, as did the later '74's, 76's and 77's: in order to meet

 emissions requirements, Porsche put on heat exchangers, which sit underneath
of 
 the engine.  The problem is that these things get incredibly hot, and have a

 tendency to melt (warp) the bottom end of the engine (cylinders).  At least
I 
 was told that's what was wrong with mine.
 
         Something to think about.  I'll be interested to see if other, more 
 knowledgeable, list members echo my concern, or tell you (and me) that I'm 
 crazy.

Todd:

I believe you're referring only to California cars with Thermo reactors and
EGR.  The "49 state" versions in 75 did'nt have these (at least not the new
75 I bought in Ohio at the time).  The emission equipment and tuneup booklet
I have even lists a different engine code for California cars.
