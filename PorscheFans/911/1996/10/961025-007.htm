Rob:

It may be neither your age NOR your car, but it's definitely
something about YOU... Apparently-respectable clean-cut folks just
don't get ticketed for the infractions you listed. 

Someone on the list recently mentioned that he has a front plate on
his car only because he doesn't like giving cops an excuse to pull
him over.  If being constantly hassled bothers you, you might want
to do the same sort of thing... Put a front plate on your car, keep
it clean, remove the "Legalize Marijuana" bumper stickers, trade in
your "2FAST4U" personalized plates and throw away the "Sit down, shut
up, and HANG ON!" license-plate frame, peel off the window tinting,
aim your headlights properly and stop driving with the foglights on
all the time, replace the Supertrapps with a real muffler, move your
radar detector from the center of your windshield to someplace a
little more discreet, cut your hair, get a job, how come you never 
write, why can't you be more like your brother....

Sorry... Got carried away.  You get the idea, though.
