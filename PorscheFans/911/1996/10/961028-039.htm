Since I wasted so much bandwidth on myself, I should probably give a few
more details about the other cars in this weekend's PIR event.

Sure, there were very few Alfas, and none of them went off-track (although
I heard Jeff Butler was the recipient of the most elegant 'black flag' of
the day, after dicing with Tom Nuxoll in their GTV's), but there were a
lot of other interesting goings-on.   I was surprised that the two
Cortinas didn't get black-flagged, as they completed each and every lap
with one's nose pressed against the other's tail ...perhaps they were
being considered as *one car* &:-).  This, coupled with the fact that one
was a twin-cam and the other was a pushrod and they were both going
all-out all the time, made for a very joyous and noisy spectacle to watch.
The green shoebox (e.g., the Mini) was fun as well -- taking the entire
course without brakes.  There were a few off-course excursions:  the red
corvette (sure, I can only tell them apart by color) in turn 9, going just
onto the grass, a '69 911S, sadly making it backwards and sideways into
the tire wall, a Honda Civic -- same place, only going forward into the
tire wall, a white (was it a C2?) -- same place, same
direction ... then there were the runoffs in turn 1 (I was in
quite good company here). Darryl Savage was the most elegant; with new
brakes, he experienced brake bias in the turn (the rear locking up), took
the inside of the turn onto the grass, then got asphalt and took the
outside onto the grass.  Pretty!  John Tilden (in those street tires) spun
backwards coming out of turn 9, but ended up going the proper direction;
my favorite 'cooked okra' 70 911 passed 5 or 6 cars on the straight and
then lost it in turn 3 (ending up facing the wrong direction).  Larry (the
driver) reported everyone waved at him in a friendly way as they proceeded
merrily on past.

The Lotus was a square blue bullet that hurtled itself around the track --
ugly as sin, but in a line that was beautiful (most of the time).  The
Ferrari went out now and then for a lap or two (leaving a trail of smoke),
and then back safely to the paddock to cool down for an hour.
There was an open-wheel, open-cockpit, open-engine car -- not quite
Formula, not quite sports-racer (I'm not a really good judge here!) which
took to the track in the fog, in the mist, and in the sun along with
everyone else.  Since I was cold in a closed car, I was sure he must be
freezing his buns off!  

PIR is definitely a place I want to visit again.  Since it is used 7 days
a week, and is a huge revenue-producer, those 'economies of scale' (or
whatever you want to call them) are passed on to the user.  Plus, none of
this 'we only maintain the track for dragsters' attitude like you get at
SIR.  It's certainly a short track, but filled with interesting curves.  I
would love to try the chicane in the middle of the straight -- it had a 90
degree right turn in it!  The track was just incredibly safe and
forgiving; a good thing, since it was so challenging.
