Early in my ownership of the 911 it was running extremely
rich. As I was passing through the biggish (by our standards)
city of Durban, I took it to the Durban Porsche agents. The
problem was diagnised as the MFI cold start enrichment
solenoid, and both it and the cutoff solenoid were disconnected.

Well, now that the rebuilt throttle bodies are in it is time
to also sort out these connections. I've puzzled over the
Haynes wiring diagram to figure out just why the enrichment
soleniod should be energised the whole time, but really don't
understand it. Since my mechanic is also puzzled, it's time
to call on the list.

Please could someone with a '69 E or S confirm which wires
go to each solenoid - and any explanation of the enrichment
circuit would be extremely welcome (I think only '69 models
have an enrichment solenoid on the MFI pump itself).

Thanks
