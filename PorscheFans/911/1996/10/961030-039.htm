According to Paul Frere who relates Porsche testing in his book "Porsche
911 Story"

An H series 911 (1975) without any aerodynamic aids has a Cd of .423,
CLf (coefficient of lift - front) of .112 and a Clr (coefficient of lift
- rear) of .246.

With the rear duck tail but without the front air dam these figures
change to a Cd of .414, Clf of .112 and Clr of .062. 

As can be seen the duck tail reduces drag slightly, has little effect on
the front end and a significant reduction in rear end lift, aka tail
happy behaviour at speed.

I don't have the effect of the front air dam with the duck tail, but
with the tray spoiler, it reduces Clf to .010.

I would imagine the effect of the two is to essentially get rid of
aerodynamic lift  and get a bit of a drag reduction to boot.

Since this is what I have done to my 911 (an H series) I am obviously a
believer....

Go for it, the duck tail is the "only" real Porsche spoiler for the rear
.. ...plus I think that those who want to serve a picnic lunch on the
back of their 911 (namely those who have the tray or whale tail spoiler)
really deserve to drive Hyundai's or....gasp  ... gasp   GMC
Jimmy's.....

Flames accepted...asbestos suit is on.....
