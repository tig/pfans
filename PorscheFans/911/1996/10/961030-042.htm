<< I currently have  Fuch 6x7 16 in wheels on a 1987 911

 Is it worth the money?
 Also, any opinions on polishing vs. chrome?

    Sure I've got an opinion. I used to have 7's ans 8's (15 inch) on my SC
and now I've gone to 8x16 and 9x17. They are great as I can put 245's and
275's where I used to only have 225's and 245's. My new wheels are Kinesis.
You can buy 3 piece Fuchs replicas (forged) in the same sizes and offsets. If
you want to stay with original Fuchs, you can use 8&9x16 if you get the right
offsets. The fronts have to come from the 1986 944 turbo if I remember
correctly and the rears are probably from a 930 turbo but I'm not certain.
You can run 225 and 245 width tires on these rims. I have a friend that was
trying to sell his spare set of these a while back, but I opted for something
wider than he had. I enjoy the look on people's faces when they see my tires
under my fenders after telling me that size doesn't fit a 911SC.
    I can't answer the money part for you but for me it was worth it. The
extra stick in the corners is great as is the extra stick for braking. It
might feel like more difference than it is, but it works for me. Whether it's
worth it to you will depend on your disposable income and your planned uses
for the car.
    I'd recommend polishing over chrome. I've never seen a polished wheel
start pitting and have the polish flake off.  <BG>

Good Luck,
