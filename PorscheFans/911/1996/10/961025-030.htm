-- [ From: Barney Bettilyon * EMC.Ver #2.5.1 ] --

Damn, winter seems to have come early to this neck of the woods. I guess
I'll soon be parking the 993 till mid March.

I've seen a number of battery maintainers advertised in the catalogs
lately, some that "alligator clip" directly to the battery, and some
that plug into the cigarette lighter. (993 lighters bypass the ignition
switch). The "good ones" supposedly turn off once the battery is fully
charged and only come back on if the voltage drops by a volt or two.

In any event, the light in the front bonnet seems to be set to come on
if the lid is even slightly open. (1/2") This means that I'll need to
keep the lid closed while running the maintainer. (Plus a car cover over
the top).

Does anyone have any experience with these things or any ideas on what
kind of problems might be caused by the Battery gasses collecting inside
an enclosed space?

Barney
