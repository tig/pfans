 Anyone else use their 911's as daily drivers (instead of putting them into 
hybernation for the winter)?<<


Hi Eric,

My car (1986 Carerra) is also a daily driver, even in the snow.  I live 
right outside of Philadelphia so I would think the climate is similar. 
 While I have used my regular street tires in the past, I plan to acquire a 
good set of snow tires this year.  That should make me feel better on those 
occasions when you are away from home when it starts snowing.

I am not an expert on longevity, or anything else for that matter, but I 
would think that the 60 mile drive with mostly highway miles is the best 
kind of use you could expect.  The engine will get up to operating 
temperature and keep the acid's and nasty stuff out of the oil.


Good Luck,

Mike Andrews
