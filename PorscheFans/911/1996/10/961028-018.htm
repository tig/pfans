Sorry to burden the whole list with this post, but I know there are a lot of
folks from the Boston area online.  I had this info forwarded to me.  I don't
know the original author and I can't vouch for it's accuracy, so I guess this
is sort of an advisory.

For those who don't know this part of Boston, I would say most people drive
through this tunnel at 55 to 65 mph.

Subj:   For those who drive into Boston, alert from engineer who designed
system


Not that anyone here would ever think of exceeding the speed limit,
but the following info may be of interest. At the Boston end of the
Mass Pike is the Prudential Tunnel. It's about .25 miles long. They've
just recently installed some new lighting in the tunnel.

Under the lighting are some boxes that look like they could be
auxiliary power supplies. They're not! They are radar speed detectors
with high-speed cameras and, once the system is fully functional, will
be part of the first unmanned speed trap in the Boston area.

You won't know that you've been bagged until your ticket shows up in
the mail.  Also, FYI, the speed limit in the tunnel and for the area
..20 miles before and after the tunnel is 45 MPH. On the inbound side,
it drops to 35 and then to 20!!  Spread the warning!!
