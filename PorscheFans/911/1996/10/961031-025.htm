I suspect your wiper relay also, but not the ground.  I suspect the
contacts.  What follows are excerpts from a post I made a couple
times on Pfiles and Pfans.

I've had this exact problem.  I either had inconsistent and
unpredictable intermittent and/or parking, or sometimes neither
at all.  It turned out to be the wiper relay.  The relay was not
really broken, the contacts were simply corroded.

The relay is located toward the passenger side of the wiper motor,
in the "behind the ducting, infront of the firewall, under the
windshield/dashboard, ABYSS" accessible by removing the speedometer
and reaching through.  I removed the relay, pryed it open, and filed
the contacts.  Just note, there are 2 sets of contacts inside the
one relay.  Works like new now.  If you simply want to replace
the relay, I think they're around $50.

Keep Porsching,
