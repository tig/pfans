Bob:

Depends on how you define "better off".

Formula One cars, for instance, generate so much drag that when the
throttle's released at top speed, they decelerate at about one G... 
Before the brakes are even applied!

Nevertheless, they manage to turn respectable lap times.

Early 911s weren't real good at high-speed stability; the
curved-on-top, flat-on-the-bottom shape made them want to fly.

I think I related an extreme example of this on the Porschephiles 
list a year or so ago:  I saw a seriously-fast VW bug running in the 
desert, and it skipped across the sand like a rock skipping across 
the surface of a pond... This was evidenced by the sound of the 
engine hitting the rev-limiter every half-second or so, and by the 
tracks it left in the sand:  Deep ruts that would disappear every so 
often.

A ducktail coupled with a front airdam nips that "flying" tendency
in the bud and does a lot to inmduce driver confidence at high 
speeds.

For anything other than land-speed-record attempts (or running at Le
Mans or something), top speed doesn't matter nearly so much as
acceleration potential, so you can add the spoiler and airdam,
re-gear the transmission so you're at the redline in fifth gear at
the drag-limited top speed (or at the top speed you're likely to see
at your particular track -- whichever's lower), then fill in the
lower gears to match.  Lap times will undoubtedly improve.
