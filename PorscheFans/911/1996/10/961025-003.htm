You guys are all lucky to not get tickets!  In my 3 years of driving in
S. CA, only one in the Porsche though.  I've gotten tickets for...
no front license plate
headlights were to bright
foglights were blinding to oncoming drivers
being to low (stock 914 height with low profile tires)
noise pollution
lack of catalytic converter(not required in a 74 or older car)
4 speeding, 37 in a 35(I didn't know the vehicle code rules for this one)
	    another because he "heard me rip through two gears" yet I was
	    doing the speed limit when I came around the building
	    and the third was for exceeding the RECOMENDED               
   speeds in a corner
	    exceeding the safe speed for the conditions
cruising, for going to Newport Beach and leaving
gross poluter, it was cold and the timing wasn't quite right
exhibition of speed(how am I supposed to go when I'm sitting on wet
paint?)

All of these tickets have been thrown out in court except for my first
speeding ticket:(   Does anyone else have problems with the S. CA police
or is it just my age/car?
