I think this may get me some flack, but I've never used Swepco -- It
seems to almost be a religious thing with Porsche owners. Working for an
oil company, does at times have it's advantages; one of which is getting
some good skinny on what works and what's hype.  Swepco is great oil.
Period.  It also is expensive, which being the American way, must make
it the best?  It was developed for the long-haul trucking industry, and
it just so happens Chevron (yes, my company), makes a competitive
product called Ultra Gear.  Wanna' know the difference?  Ultra gear
doesn't come in a container smaller than 5 gallons, and it costs about
$7.50 a gallon, versus about $30 a gallon for Swepco.  Period.  Both
products happen to do marvellously well in Porsche transmissions.

Personally, I'd go for the Ultra Gear ISO 220 weight (85w-90).  You
probably have to go to a truck stop or Chevron distributor to find it
(or order it from a dealer).

Ultra Gear: only reason Nissan's GTP car ever finished an endurance race
w/o a failed gearbox (sorry Swepco, it didn't work for them, nor any
other gear lube, synth or other, for that matter...).

And this time a disclaimer:  I do not speak for my employer, Chevron
Inc.

'84 911 (didn't miss a shift all weekend, damn I hate those 915s....
:-)
'72 911 3.2 (lot's of hard use on Ultra Gear over the years)
