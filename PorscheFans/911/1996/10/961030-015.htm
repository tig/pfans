Thomas,

I went through this this past Christmas.  (I was a very good boy, and
Santa, better known as my wife, was very good to me last year!) <G>
After sorting out wheel fitment issues, tire debates, etc . . . , I
changed my '88 Carrera form 16x6&7's to 16x7&8's, all 911 offset, and
put on Bridgestone S-02's, 205/55 front, 245/45 rear.  I have no
fender clearance problems, and as the 245/45 S-02's actually measure
more like a 230, (only slightly larger than a 225/50 S-02), the 8's on
the rear give the tires an optimal footprint. The car is very neutral
with this wheel/tire combo, and the S-02's have the best tossability,
at the limit of adhesion, of any street tire I have ever experienced.

I talked to the good folks at Bridgestone Motorsports before I made 
my purchase, and they told me that one of the cars used for 
development of the 16" S-02 sizes, was a late 80's Carrera with the 
factory sport Bilsteins.  He also explained that the 245/45 was only 
slightly different in size from the 225/50 as they had experienced 
some type of tread squirm / handling / wear anomaly when they tested a 
true 245mm wide 245/45 prototype.  I elected not to use 16 x 9's on 
the rear as Bridgestone did not recommend them for the "narrow" 
245/45 tire.

I had my wheels polished and painted by Rennsport, in Roswell, Ga,
just north of Atlanta.  They are gorgeous, and I had the centers
repainted in gloss black.    I had the tires drop shipped from the
Tire Rack, and Rennsport mounted and balanced them without any
external weights or wheel damage.  They charged me $100/wheel for
this. They advertise in Pano, and have done an excellent job repairing
and polishing Fuchs for me.  The number is 770-992-9442. Rob Rice is
the owner, and the person I have dealt with.  No financial interest,
just a very satisfied customer.

The few people I have talked to about chroming all said the same 
thing.  It is not a matter of if it will flake off, but of when.  It 
is also quite a bit more money to get a wheel chromed vs. polishing.

Good luck
