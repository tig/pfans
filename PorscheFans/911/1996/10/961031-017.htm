Armondos right!!!!Don't come here!! California Sucks, we got fire, we got 
earthquakes, we got bad food (Odwalla), and salty water(whole damn ocean on 
the left).  We got taxes, we got smog regs., we only have 4 great road 
circuits, and NASCAR, and INDY cars and...too many Porsches..and no snow 
tires.....heluva shortage of snow tires......... and rust, we have no rust 
unless you drive in the salty water so if you like rust......oh,...uh.... did 
I mention the FIRES and the EARTHQUAKES, don't come here....stay 
away........it's getting too crowded.......thanks,  Ted

I normaly don't do this...!!!!!!! 
 
I could not pass this one up.....your not the only one with  
sunshine! 
 
{{{{ $1150.00 }}}} !!!!  
I know you don't have a choice but you are being screwed! 
 
Don't try to call it a sun tax....say you live in a area where  
people are paying too much in taxes and they won't do anything  
to change it! Or ...It's ok I have money to burn and I like the  
way the system works.   
 
In FL where we have sun year around...no snow... 
or any other of those northern goodies..... 
 
I pay $46 reg. a year for my 88 911.                                           
(No property tax no nothing on the car!)           
 
Ok we don't have mountains....but then we don't have to worry about them  
falling on us either! Yes we have huricanes but we use them to put out 
our fires...You could use a couple yourselves from what  
I see on TV! 
 
My Point is that people live where they do becuase 
for a reason. Don't slam them for that! 
I think the tone of the thread was more of 
"WOW! You folks in CA are getting screwed!" 
Not that you are stupid for paying the TAX, like I said 
I know you don't have much of a choice.  
(Just vote for someone who will change it) 
 
(you might make CA a place worth moving to! Well, I won't go that far.)  
 
				Ok I have my Nomex On 
				(I know its comming)
