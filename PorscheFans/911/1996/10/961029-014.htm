Oh, lordy! Does this mean we should all drop our Porsches in favor of
Corvettes, which have been made for many years and are in the same price
category? What about Jaguar XJSs? Mercedes SLs? 300 ZXs? Lincoln Mark
IV-VIIIs? Eldor(Toron)ados?

I really don't think you like your 911s because the line was introduced a
long time ago, or because more of them have been sold than of some other
model, Porsche or otherwise. I'm sure that you bought them and like them
because of the way they work and how you feel when you drive them. At least
our kindly ol' Unka Bart has made clear that he enjoys (though his own
description was more graphic) trailing throttle oversteer!

Funny you should mention that. Hemmings Motor News (open with great care,
ye motorheads) shows a number of $9000+ 2CVs and some very expensive Model
Ts, not to mention a burgeoning support structure for the latter and a
non-trivial one for the former. What could these people be thinking?
