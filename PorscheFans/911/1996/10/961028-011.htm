The Second Meeting
by Larry Wilson

As before, the meeting takes place in an out-of-the-way and modestly
appointed hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland. It is the second confidential
gathering of Norbert Singer (Porsche AG), Ron Dennis (McLaren Cars
Limited), and Christian Contzen (Renault Company), but the first for the
group's newest member, Anthony Patterson (Chrysler Motors). Their goal is
to elevate GT racing to the preeminent level of motorsport, world-wide.
There's probably no truth to this story. But on the other hand, it could
have happened -- it's plausible.

Dennis: It's good to see you again, Norbert and Christian, but first let us
welcome Anthony as the newest member of our little group.

Patterson: Thank you for inviting me -- it is truly an honor to work with
the strongest advocates of GT racing in Europe. I hope we can work together
to bring this exciting competition to the United States, as a home market
showcase for our Viper GTS.

Dennis: Yes, that certainly is our purpose. But, before we hear more about
Chrysler's plans for the Viper, let me once again congratulate you,
Norbert, this time on your two successive wins in the BPR GT Endurance
Series, at Brands Hatch and Spa. With a single-car entry against a very
competitive field, the results with your new Porsche 911 GT1 were simply
splendid. And, as at Le Mans, our McLaren teams tried their best, but your
car dominated at both events.

Singer: Thank you Ron. As you know, testing programs cannot match actual
racing experience, so we entered a single car in both races merely as a
continuation in the development of our new 911 GT1. Now that our testing is
completed, we will concentrate on delivering technically correct and
totally competitive racing vehicles to our customer teams in time for the
1997 BPR season.

Dennis: Yes, rather. You've done that quite well, I should think, judging
from the comments we've received from our racing teams. Frankly, we were
caught out a bit by the success of your new car, and the completely new
McLaren F1 GTR won't be ready until the 1998 series. We did, however, have
a development car at the October 6th BPR event at Nogaro, France, which
performed quite well during free practice with many of our team drivers
participating. We've promised the resulting technical data to all of our
customer teams for next year. Along those lines, Christian, why don't you
tell us about the progress of Renault's new GT racer.

Contzen: Thank you, Ron. As I mentioned previously, the company announced
on June 20th that Renault is quitting Formula One racing at the end of the
1997 season, but we also assured the public that Renault Sport will
continue to operate after 1997 as an independent unit, run by me and
Bernard Dudot. I also mentioned that we intended to re-enter GT racing with
a Renault Alpine equipped with a turbocharged version of our successful F-1
V10 engine. That has changed. After 5,000 kilometers of testing since June,
we have chosen the Renault Le Mans as our GT1 entry for 1997. We replaced
the smaller F-1 engine with a V6 of the Renault Safrane Biturbo which, at
the moment, produces 520hp. The car competed earlier in the British GT
Championship, but for its BPR-debut at Nogaro the chassis and suspension
were greatly modified, the brakes are now Alcon-Carbone Industrie and we
changed the gearbox to a Hewland DGC. A road car of the Renault LM will be
on sale in January 1997 and we hope to enter two cars in all BPR rounds
next year. Of course, for now it is a private initiative of RJ Racing, a
young team based in Teloche, near Le Mans, but Renault Sport gives
important technical support to the team through our Special Projects
Manager, Jean Coquery. As an official factory team, however, we should be
ready for 1997.

Dennis: Wonderful news, Christian! And Anthony, how is your program coming
along?

Patterson: We too were at Nogaro, but with only two Vipers, each equipped
with bigger rear brakes and a new engine prepared by Heini Mader. We were
quite pleased with the first qualifying session after placing second and
fifth. Happily, both cars were very strong at the finish of the four-hour
race, in 6th and 8th positions. Like Renault, our venture appears to be the
private initiative of Team Oreca, but Chrysler will have an official
presence during the 1997 season. I think we will win a couple of races.

Dennis: At our last meeting, we talked about competing in the U.S. --
either in the SCCA World Challenge series or the IMSA GT series. Anthony,
what news do you bring from America?

Patterson: In September, those prospects were thrown into a cocked-hat when
Roberto Muller acquired IMSA, literally from under the noses of the group
of IMSA-racers that had been negotiating the purchase since last spring. We
don't know where Muller stands with respect to allowing BPR cars run on an
equal footing with the tube-frame EXXON GT cars and with a
restrictor/weight allowance that will allow us to compete for over-all.
Then, the SCCA canceled its plan for a World Challenge series three-hour
race at Sebring in October, ostensibly because sponsorship did not
materialize. That race was to be a preview of their 1997 World Challenge
GT1 series with several BPR teams competing. So, the prospects of a
triple-crown for GT cars -- Daytona, Sebring, and Le Mans -- is still up in
the air. I think we'll have to continue working on this.

Singer: That's unfortunate news, Anthony. You're right, of course. We must
apply more pressure to the Americans. Now, for our next meeting, who shall
we invite into our little group? Ron? Christian? Anthony?

Contzen: I would have thought, the Italians, but they are too preoccupied
with making their new F50 LM complete a four-hour race simulation. Why not
meet here again in two months and reconsider inviting Ferrari. Plus, we
must give further effort to racing all of our cars in North America.

Singer: Agreed.

Patterson: Agreed

Dennis: Yes, until our next meeting.

P.S., Two 911 GT1s are running the BPR race at Zuhai (China) this coming
weekend. About 32 GT-1/2 cars are entered.
