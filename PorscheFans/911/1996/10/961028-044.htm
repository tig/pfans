   Caustic Soda is the active ingredient required to remove the anodizing from
aluminum. Never could figure out how the Brits make alu-minium out of the word.
   Anyway, if you have access to a chemical supply house, this is the stuff to
use. While you are at it, pick up a pair of those heavy rubber gloves and ALWAYS
wear goggles when using.
   The drain cleaners are much less toxic and require several applications. I
have used several brands of the crystal type. I think they are probably all
about the same in composition.
   Mix about a third of a can in a pint of warm water and stir untill dissolved.
Apply with a disposable brush. Let set for a minute or so and then rinse. The
surface will appear almost white. Stubborn areas may require repeated
application.
   From there, you can sand, polish or whatever. Barring that, I go with the man
who said " drop them off at the polishers, and let them do it".
