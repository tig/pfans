Nonsense! About an hour ago I installed my new Balupunkt RL5429 5.25" 2-way
speakers in the doors of my '87 Targa. The PO had two Pioneer whatevers in
there, the driver's side with an open cone that made clicking noises on
Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" (can't have that when fahrfanuggin der
Porsche). The Blau's went in without so much as a gotterdamerung.

Now, my '87 has obvious factory holes in the door with plastic baffles. The
screw holes lined up perfectly with der Blau speakers so that the
"Blaupunkt" nomen is at the top when the covers are installed. If you don't
have these holes then...gotterdamerung.
