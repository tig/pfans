Synchronicity. After I removed the engine pan on my 91 C4 I discovered a
small pooling of oil that was otherwise masked, having been held in by the
belly pan. Thinking it was only the chain cover gaskets I asked to have the
small leak fixed with new gaskets ... ka-ching ... wound up being $300, and
new gaskets on both sides. But after that work I noticed that I'd still get
a few drops of oil dripping from that area when the engine was hot. The
shop looked at it again and after considerable work (e.g. dye in the oil)
traced the leak to the cam o-rings leading into the timing chain area. They
then spent even more work replacing them with the engine in the car ...
ka-ching ... another $160. (This latter amount was after discounting labor
in recognition that they had missed the original cause of the leak in the
first go around.

In hindsight I'm glad to have the leaks fixed. Although the volume of oil
was small, I hate to see my Porsche leak fluids; I wouldn't litter, or spit
on the sidewalk :') If I thought I'd be dropping the engine anytime soon I
would have waited. I thought I'd save money by combining the work with a
valve adjustment but it still took a lot of extra steps. It is a
complicated job, with a lot of disassembly and labor involved, to fix (as
Fred Hess described in detail). Get an estimate that they and you can live
with beforehand.
