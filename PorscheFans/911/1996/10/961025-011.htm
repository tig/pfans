The following was posted by Terry Shugart:

Pfans:
As I and some others have mentioned I installed a Marine style plastic
battery box on the battery tray of my 75.  These boxes ($8) come in
different sizes but the one that will go on the tray with the least
hassle is sized for a Type 24 battery.  The only problem is T 24
batteries are in the neighborhood of 455 Cold cranking amps where my 75
calls for 650.  When replacing the battery after my overhaul I found that
a Type 71 also fits nicely into the same box and gives 675 CC Amps.  In
my case I used an Exide which had end centered connectors (Nice) and a
molded in handle (Very Nice).  $68 at Auto Palace with a 72 month
warranty and bought in Boston on Sunday no less.
