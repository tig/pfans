Stephen,

The black aluminum on my 86 911 was faded to almost grey.  Windshield wipers
no color.  All of mine were painted not anodized.  Treated them just like any
other paint.  I used a combination of polishes.  3M Imperial Hand Glaze and
Maquires Swirl Remover (designed for clear coat paints) and another Maquires
product of slightly more aggresive nature (memory fails me for the name and
number, but it looks like baby s#$t) depending on how bad the paint had faded
and how close it was to the body paint.  Used Maguires yellow carnauba wax
afterward.  All came back nicely.

After this you will see how crappy your black rubber looks and, of course,
 the black parts will now shine more than the rest of the car, so you will
have to do that as well.

The black rubber cleans up nicely with about 5 applications of glass cleaner
and elbow grease, then some Lexol vinyl treatment. Which messes up the nice
clean glass.

Don't know about anodized aluminum.
