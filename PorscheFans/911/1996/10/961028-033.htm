I phoned the South Western Petroleum Co. in Ft. Worth, Texas a while =
back and found out that they actually had a local distributor in Calgary =
(Canada) and got it for about half the price of mail order (mind =
you....I had to buy the smallest container of 5 gallons).  I ran into =
the same 'Huh??' when enquiring locally about Swepco.  Worth a phone =
call anyway, and you'll have no trouble selling what you don't need....

Subject: 	Where do I find Swepco or Red-Line in CO?

I've been looking around for high quality gear oil to put in my '83=20
911SC.  I've gotten lots of recommendations for Swepco and Red-Line.
I've called a bunch of places and nobody has even heard of Swepco.
No one can tell me where to get Red-Line, either.
Any help on finding this in Colorado would be appreciated.

If not that, then ideas on other, more common brands of oil to put=20
in my tranny would be helpful.

Thanks,

Chris Cope
