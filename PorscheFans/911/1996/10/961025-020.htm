Phans,

A Fuchs story....

Some of you may remember a few years back that I bought an 82 SC that had
been wreched to put my 67 back together that had been stolen. The two front
(6x16) were in very bad shape. This guy fliped, smashed and rolled this car
about 8 times. The great thing about the fronts was that the metal only
"tore". It was like the pole he hit just poked a hole in one and the curb
gouged a chunck out of the other and ripped the lip so that it hung to the
side. But get this......I still have those 2 rims with the Dunlops that were
on the car over 2 years ago and they still hold air (never even added air to
them)and I use them when painting 911's. If you saw these rims you would
find it hard to believe that they would hold air...The 2 backs are now on
the 67 and are in perfect shape after polishing(Thanks Howard).

Just a testimony to the holy Fuch...
Steve
