Here's an update on my sticky 911SC throttle.  I drove the car this weekend,
and it was running smooth again (warm out though, 60's).  No spitting and
sputtering.  But the throttle would still stick, pretty regularly.

When I got home, it was idling around 2200 rpm, but smooth & not missing.  I
took the air cleaner assembly off, and manually moved the sensor plate arm.
 When I pulled down on the arm slightly, the car would return to a normal
idle.

Is my problem simply my sensor plate binding, or out of adjustment?  Or am I
simply compensating for another problem by moving the sensor plate?  Also, if
I pulled down the plate, but didn't hold it until the car returned to idle,
the rpm's would have a tendency to slowly climb back to where they were.

I haven't had time to actually play around with it more.  Do I need any
special tools to adjust this plate?  Is it as easy to get to as pulling that
black boot looking thing off the top of the engine?
