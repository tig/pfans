What it means is that if one has $X to spend, he or she makes a decision
to purchase the car that best meets their needs in their price range. If
they want to be coddled in luxury or go fast and feel the bumps, then
they choose what they like.

I bet they were thinking that they would be willing to spend their
dollars on the Model T or 2CV instead of a used 928 or 911 or whatever.
I am glad that not everyone likes the same car, as that one would be
real expensive. When someone makes a comment about their vehicle being
"best" what they are really saying is "best for me". If this changes to
best 0-60 or some other quantifiable chateristic then it can be measured
and we are no longer talking about value judgements.
