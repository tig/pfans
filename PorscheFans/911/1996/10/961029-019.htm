As a matter of fact, yes, it happens on my '92 Turbo as well but is it the same 
noise??  I had it checked and part of the noise turned out to be the bearing in 
the alternator which I had a shop replace (only the bearing).  Now the noise is 
slightly different, also only when the car is first started and only at very 
low RPMs and only when the AC is on which leads me to belive that its the AC 
compressor...  Its not getting any worse and I'm sick of putting $1000's in my 
mechanic's pocket so I'll replace that one myself when I cant stand it any 
longer :)
