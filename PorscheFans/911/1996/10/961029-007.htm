You have to remember that the duck tail was just about the first aerodynamic
aid on a production car, ever. (I can think of a very few earlier ones -- the
Plymouth Super Bird/Dodge Daytona for one). Manufacturers were just beginning
to learn how these things worked. And once Porsche put it on the RS,
everybody copied it. Turns out it wasn't as bad as you might think.

One of the most important books on the technical history of the 911 is
"Porsche 911 Story" by Paul Frere. My 1976 edition says, on p. 94, 

"c. a special plastic engine-room lid incorporating a 'duck tail' spoiler was
a standard fitment. As we shall see in a later chapter, this did not
completely eliminate rear-end lift, but reduced it by over 100 kg (220 lb) at
152 mph and created approximately equal lift front and rear, so that the road
behaviour remained consistent as the speed increased. It also reduced drag by
3 per cent."

Later, p. 126-127:

"...it had now become urgent to reduce the rear end lift... as the
considerably greater rear lift created a tendency for the car to oversteer in
high speed bends, especially if lifting off became necessary, which is just
the opposite of what is required.  ...further tests were made...leading to
the glass fibre rear lid incorporating the now well-known Carrera 'duck tail'
spoiler which proved extremely efficient in balancing front and rear end
lift, and also proved beneficial in reducing the car's overall drag. It was
used in connection with a slightly different front air dam with a more
prominent central part in which a large oil cooler could be housed for
racing, and this was apparently even more effective in reducing front end
lift than the standard F-series air dam.

"The rear spoiler, which increases the rear wheel grip by no less than 20
percent at the car's maximum speed, has the additional advantage that,
combined with the front air dam, it moves the center of pressure back... with
a resultant noticeable decrease in the car's sensitivity to side winds. This
is further decreased by the fact that the air dam and rear spoiler
combination also reduces the tendency for the lift to increase in side winds.
It is also noteworthy that the aerodynamic aids result in a front/rear lift
ratio of 45/55, almost exactly matching the car's weight distribution -- an
ideal state of affairs."

If you read Frere's book carefully, you will also see why Porsche is adamant
about not installing the front air dam without the rear spoiler. Such a
combination does increase front downforce the but front pitching moment
actually increases rear lift. 

Paul Frere goes into later spoiler developments, which brought even better
results. The Carrera RSR Turbo racer of 1974 had a huge boxy wing on the car,
and the "whale tail," larger and more effective than the duck tail, came out
with the 911 Turbo in 1975.

I recall seeing or hearing somewhere Porsche internal test reports which
strongly recommended that ordinary production cars of the 1980s (can't
remember if 3.2 Carrera or 3.0 SC) not be sold without the Turbo whale tail,
for handling reasons, but the non-Turbo has always been offered without for
aesthetic and marketing reasons.
