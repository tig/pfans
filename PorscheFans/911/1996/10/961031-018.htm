Actually, it's a political correctness tax.  If he can afford a P..., he can
afford ... It's not just Porsches, it's anything new, even family-mobiles.

I prefer older cars.  The reg on my '83 is about $85/yr, on the '65 is about
the same because of a personal plate.

We do, but the demographics are changing.  When the number of voters on
welfare constitute a majority, look out!  A full THIRD  of the cars on the
road here are uninsured.  There is an initiative on the ballot that would
deny uninsured motorists from suing for other than direct damages in
collisions.  People are actually AGAINST it .  Why are our taxes and
insurence so high?  Because there is a growing irresponsible segment of the
population preying on the rest of us!  The courts are supporting them.  We
pass laws, the courts throw them out.  Sigh.
