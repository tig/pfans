I drive by California Cars in Calabasas frequently and I think the owner
is a patient of my father-in-law (which doesn't say anything for the
owner).  They usually have at least 8+ 911s of all ages, a few 928s and
914s plus some neat American muscle, and a Jaguar from time to time.  They
also have a very early (1953 I think) 356 cabriolet (bent windshield,
small round tail lights, non-crested front hood handle) - mustard yellow
with brown interior.  It has been there for ages and looks like a few 
years old bad restoration - with unknown attention to authenticity (my 
guess is that it is a 80's-hype restoration that did not get anywhere).  
Anyway, besides all that, I agree 100% with Jay's comments about going the 
other direction from any Porsche seller who won't let you take it to your
mechanic, and I'd add, with all the receipts and papers for the car.  
It's still a nice place to look at once and a while.
