Jay--
Have your car towed to a competent Porsche mechanic. He will be able to
determine whether it is a serious problem or a warning light failure. If
you cut the engine right away, you probably didn't do much harm, even if
it is a serious oil pressure problem. 

My recently purchased '68 had a serious oil pressure problem. The
previous owner had the engine rebuilt just before I bought the car, and
the mechanic left a 2-cent plastic plug in the oil cooler connection
port on the block. The 2-cent plug got sucked in by the oil pump and it
quit pumping. I, too, cut the engine, but not at once (I didn't notice
the oil light right away, and my car doesn't have an oil pressure
gauge). Still, I din't do any serious damage; it just required a
complete takedown of the engine to get to the oil pump to remove the
plug. The oil pump is the first part into the engine, and last one out.
While in there the mechanic did replace some suspicious parts and had
the crankshaft re-trued, but mostly I paid for a whole lot of
labor--$3300, to be exact, and $800 for parts. I hope your problem is
something simple like a faulty warning light or faulty oil pressure
release valve. Myabe someone more experienced on the list will give you
some simple things you can check out yourself. 
Good luck,
Luther

Good luck.
