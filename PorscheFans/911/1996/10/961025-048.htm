The VC section info implies that if DMV only issues you one plate (as in 
motorcycles and 
trailers) you only display one.  My Porsche purchased used only CAME with one 
plate.  I 
specifically asked the previous owner for the front plate.  He didn't have it 
nor did he remember 
what happened to it.  Possibly he was issued two plates - the standard for 
passenger cars and 
trucks.  I think I could get a sworn statement from the previous owner about the
lack of front 
plate but I really wonder if that would suffice.  If DMV provides a replacement 
for lost/damaged 
front plates you really may have no excuse for not having one.  "ignorance of 
the law is no 
excuse...etc."  I think I'll check to see how hard it is to get a replacement 
front plate before 
I get stopped by some officer with an attitude against Porsche.

        Phil:

        If the other owner only received one plate from DMV, and swears to it, 
then you should be within the law.  If he got two but just gave you one, that's 
a different story, and not within CVC section 5200.  As for DMV providing for a 
replacement, if they only sent you one, it seems to me that you're under no 
obligation to go get another one, since CVC section 5200 specifically provides 
for the situation where you are only sent one - you put it on the rear of the 
vehicle.  This wouldn't be ignorance of the law - it maybe would be a little too
much knowledge of the law! :-)  Of course, a judge may think you're clever and 
find you not guilty, but he may also order you to contact DMV and get another 
one, in which case you would then be obligated to do so.
