About a week ago the windshield wipers on my 88 coupe started to act
up.  When I turned them off the wipers just stop where they were
instead of park at the base of the windshield.  Also, the
timed delay wiper switch can not be adjusted as it's supposed to but
just work as the wiper stalk (i.e., when I turn it on the wipers wipe,
when I turn it off the wipers stop at where they were).  This happened
last Tuesday, but then the next morning everything works just fine for
a while and then it stops working ever since.  I suspect maybe the
ground connection for the relay is loose since it worked for awhile
but I don't know where to find it.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.
