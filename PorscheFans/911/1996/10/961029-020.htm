Andy,

I believe that the ducktail and whaletail (early whaletail from '76 turbo)
not only reduced lift but also reduced drag. Paul Fere's Book, "911
Story", has the numbers. The whaletale was MUCH better than the ducktail
at reducing lift and also had better drag reduction numbers.

Please not that these devices do not provide downforce, they reduce lift.
There is a difference.
