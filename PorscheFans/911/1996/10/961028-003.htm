A couple of years ago I needed to cleanup a set of Fuchs wheels and I too 
was faced with the dilemma of how to remove the clear anodizing.

A friend referred me to a metal finishing shop about five miles from my 
house.  They stated that they would indeed remove the finish from my wheels 
and their fee for this service was thirty dollars.  I would be able to drop 
off the wheels on the way to work and pick them up on my way home.  The 
place looked like a toxic waste dump, but the wheels came back looking 
great.  No finish front or back and no nasty chemicals to deal with at home.

I don't know if you have access to this kind of facility, but it would be 
worth a couple of phone calls.  An added plus to this adventure is they also 
anodize and can come up with a variety of different colors.  I wonder what a 
set of blue Fuchs would look like?

Anyway, good luck with your refinishing project.

Mike Andrews
