"THIS IS NOT A FLAME" 
 
I did not see the word race anywhere in his post? 
Much less a ref to being used by a race team. 
Did I miss the original? 
 
I thought it was a valid question. 
Are they the same product diff name brand 
or  
do they have the same specs  
or 
are they just both gear oil and that is all they have in common 
 
 
I don't think the original post was not clear at all 
as to what made them the same. It was implied that the only diff was  
price. Other than that nothing else was stated. It had to be assumed. 
And we all know what happens when we assume!

I think Scott was pretty clear in saying that Chevron's product was NOT 
the same. Note that he said that Ultra Gear was used by a race team and 
worked where SWEPCO did not.
