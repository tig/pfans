Ok list, 

For those of you that have been following my travails of the broken/cut 
head studs.

I finally got to the shop that has the local EDM machine.  Things arn't 
quite what they had been portrayed to me over the phone.

EDM machines come in a couple of varieties.  The one that I looked at had 
a single wire that was used to cut dies from solid metal.  These things 
are capable of intricate cuts or profiles of solid metal.  

The EDM machine type that is necessary to erode the insides of studs out 
of heads will nead to be of a "plunger" type.  This type machine will 
make the continuous pits necessary to erode the center of the studs.  The 
head would be mounted on a 3 axis table and micrometer movements of it 
would allow the accuracy necessary to cut the core of the stud.

The owner of the machine shop however suggested the familiar method of 
accurately finding the center of the stud.  Mounting it rigidly on the 
three axis table and drilling it with a center/stepped drill.  The follow 
up could be done with a small end mill.  I am familiar with this routine 
and have often toyed with the idea of selling my drill press and 
replacing it with a drill/mill.

If any of you are contemplating using the EDM machine remember to find 
out which type of machine the shop has first.  This will save you a lot 
of time.

Meanwhile the mechanic is calling for the heads and has told me that he 
can do a "pretty good" job with a hand held 1/4" drill.  Are there any of 
you that need recommendations for a "Professional Porsche Mechanic?"
