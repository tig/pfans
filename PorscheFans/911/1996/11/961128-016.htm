I bought the factory manuals on microfiche for about $20 from, I believe,
Stoddard. I think your local Porsche dealer can order them for this price.
I bought a small reader for $70 from a used camera store--call around.
Whenever I need hardcopy my wife takes them into work (she's a HS media
specialist) with her, but the public library will have a printer.

The idle probem sounds like the idle stabilizer. I had to replace mine (got
lucky and found a used one for $65) and also the drive transistors in the
DME (not for the electronics novice to attempt). Yours sounds like it is
telling you that it is dirty. Take it out and clean it with carburetor
cleaner spray. If it jams, which I believe mine did, it may burn up and
take the DME with it. The repair I did on my 911 for $75 could easily
exceed $1150 at the dealer ($1000 for DME, $150 for stabilizer, $??? for
labor).
