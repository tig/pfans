Hi All,
I'm a little late with this, but I have recently added factory rear 3 point
belts and a European Child Seat to my 1984 911.
After a lot of research, help from the pfiles and some heartache I found:

Rear seat belts:
1.)  The parts diagram is wrong for the 1984 rear belts.
2.)   That I could order the retractors for the 1988/89 and sub. 911 and they
will work in my 1984. (and I assume in all '84 to '89's, don't know about
SC's)

After removing the rear hat shelf I noticed the threaded hard point for the 3
point belt was there, the insulation was even cut to accept the retractor.
I ordered the factory retractor and bolts from Professionally Engineered
Products (Pano).  The retractor then bolts to the threaded hard point under
the hat shelf.  The end of the webbing connects to the attachment for the
existing lap retractor which is removed. The male end of the new belt works
with the existing female seat belt connector.  
The biggest problem I had was that the trim pieces that cover the hole that
the webbing exits the hat shelf from are not available.  I believe the 1988
was the only year they offered the 3 point rear belts as an option in the
U.S. before changing the hat shelf and exit point of the belt in the later
cars.  I had a local upholstery shop cut the holes and fabricate the trim
pieces for the hat shelf.  The good news is with the above no holes have to
be drilled in the body and you retain the factory look and safety
engineering.  The bad news is that it's more expensive than adding
aftermarket belts.  I believe around $500 for all the parts.

Child Seat:
A Porsche child seat can be ordered from Europe.  The seat comes in three
parts and is designed to have parts removed as the child grows. It is rated
for children from 20 to I believe 40 pounds.     

I ordered the seat from :

AFN Porsche
Chiswick Garage
Great West Road
London, England, UK
Telephone: 011-44-181-742-7000
I dealt with Sanjay Vaid, Parts Sales Executive.  He was a big help and even
mailed me a picture of the seat so I could see it before I bought it.  The
price was 130 British Pounds at $1.70 to 1, would be about $221.00 plus
shipping and customs duty.  The seat does require a three point harness to
work correctly.  It's a very nice seat and we're happy with it, however, use
it at your own risk as it is not for sale and probably not approved for the
U.S..  
If you need more info. or want the picture, email me at Johnt26@AOL.com
