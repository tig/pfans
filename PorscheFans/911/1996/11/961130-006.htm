The 912E is the 911 with the 914 2.0 engine. Since these cars are now 20
years old you need to look for a lot of things, rubber, paint, interior,
suspension, wheels, tires. Prior body damage. you are correct in getting
the car cked out by either dealer or independent porsche mech.

I intend to have it inspected prior to the purchase by a Porsche

Can't help with this one, but someone else on the list should.

No way on this these are not designed for any adult. Work good for younger
children.

If you don't know th answer to a ? then it is not naive. All of us started
somewhere on this. 

BTW the 912E is considered  a collector by some so you may pay more for
this model than a newere pcar.
One rule of thumb is buy the newests lowest mile pcar for the $$'s you
have. Take you time looking for the right pcar.
