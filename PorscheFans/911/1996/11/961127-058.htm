Argeo,

   Are you sure what you see on startup is from oil ? While I don't think it is
unusual for a 911 to smoke a little on startup, what you are seeing may be
unburnt fuel. As the early cars have no choke, I always have to pump a little
extra fuel into mine before cold starting to richen it up. When the engine
starts, there is a certain amount of whitish colored fumes, cosisting of water
and unburnt fuel. If the condition ceases after warmup I doubt if you have
anything to worry about.
   In order to come up with any jet info on your Weber carbs, you will need to
know which model you have. Are they 40 IDA 3C/1, 40IDAP 3C/1, or 40IDT 3C/1.
