Hi phans, 

I just got my dream RS America last week, so on Saturday I began to
dissasemble it. Actually, just trying to install a radio. I've done this 
before, but now faced with 5 or 6 leads when two do for most cars, I am 
totally at a loss.

Can anybody clue me in on the radio-related wire identities for a the
C2? Heres what I have so far:
Red---Battery-direct
Brown---ground
Red w/ black dotted line---?Accessory (switched) power lead?
Green---?alarm??
Thin wire bundled with antenna lead---antenna booster power lead?

Also there is the small matter of the alarm. As the old (not factory 
installed) Blaupunkt is currently wired, the alarm functions only when 
the radio is on, but goes to the double-flash (some points not secure) 
mode when the radio is off. What's the right way to do this?

How is the alarm attached to an aftermarket (or factory) radio? What do
the alarm leads look like?

Will I be in my grave and the car a pile of rust and plastic bits before
Haynes publishes a repair manual? Wait, I already know the answer to
this one.

If you have any (no I won't say "leads") helpful hints and encouragement 
I am sure the list will be grateful for a change in topic.

It's Guards Red, but I'm toying with adding white wavy stripes across
the hood and a big blue patch with white stars on the right rear rump.
