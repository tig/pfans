HI Bob,

PCA is trying to decide what to do about the Boxster roll bar. I vote for
requiring a real roll bar myself. Seems a safer posture for the club to me.
The factory bar does not comply with the clubs rules for a roll bar so it
isn't a roll bar. 

I am also surprised that they are limiting the Turbos that they will sell
this year. I would have figured that they would sell all that the traffic
would bear. Are all of the gold chain set $150K models gone too?

Has anybody heard what posture PCA will take on the new car? Will a 
roll cage be required, a roll bar or is the factory setup good enough?

My friendly dealer called to say that according to a call he got from 
PCNA, there are no more 993 turbos!  I can't believe this.  The 
dealer is pretty bummed out as he figures he was going to sell me one 
(also true since I'm tired of being passed by hot rodded 951's and I 
don't want to strip my 993 to make it competitive).  

I can't believe what he told me as I'm sure the last year of the air 
cooled turbo will be a big sales hit. <
