Hi George,

No, the new book covers everything from the beginning of the 911 up until the
current models. A lot of the photos have changed and there is not much on the
935s in the new edition, but otherwise we still do the early cars as well.
Where did you get the impression that the new version started with 1984?

Bruce,

I am under the impression that the new book starts with model year 84 and
covers to present day. Is this true and would this book be of help to someone
looking to purchase a 75-83 911 and how?  Didn't want to make this a book
review but after the responses I received personally to my post some
clarification would be helpful to know what to expect when the new books are
released.

Warmest Regards....
George
