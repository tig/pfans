HI Terry,

It was aftermarket and sold by Performance Products. They had a finite number
and when they were gone they were gone forever. 

I am not sure that they were a better mousetrap, just a different mouse trap.
If you have a late model plastic Porsche air box, keep your motor in good
running condition and have a pop off valve you wont have any problems.

Pfans:
It what appears to be my never ending quest to cure my leaking CIS system   
(Terry? oh yeah last time I saw Terry he was giving that Porsche of his   
mouth to mouth,,, weird dude) I've seen a couple of references to an   
aluminum air box.  Could someone enlighten me as to whether this is an   
after market item or did some years of Porsche have an aluminum box for   
CIS equipped cars?
TIA
Terry
75 911S (Still leaking but whats a little fuel among friends)
