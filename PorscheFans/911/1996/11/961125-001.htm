Frank, look around the front suspension mounts and rear torque tube. Much o=
f =
the rust comes from battery spill over, sometimes rusts under the gas tank =
and inside front fender wells. Both are very costly to fix! Also look below =
=
the rear window as water gets trapped there from leaking window seals....I =
know these from experience! These older cars can seem like a good price but =
=
can quickly add up. Sill fun cars though! Good luck!

 I'm looking at a '69 911S for sale locally for $4k.  I went
over and took quick look at it and it seemed pretty nice for the
price. The owner had the batteries out of it so I didn't hear it
run(he said if I was serious he'd put them in and start it for me).
The engine and MFI system seemed to be complete and well cared for
(from a visual at least). He said it starts and runs well but won't
idle well. It has a rebuilt injector unit. Body wise, it has new red
paint, Fuch wheels w/ new BFG tires. I didn't notice any dings or
rust in my limited poking around. Most of the chrome window trim,
horn grills, etc have been replaced with the black versions. The
interior was in good shape with newly recovered seats, but the dash
is badly cracked.
 I'm going to have a mechanic check it out. Does this sound
like a fair price? I know nothing about the MFI system - what sort of
things cause poor idle/cold start? Where are some of the places to
look for rust on these? Any other gotchas I should look for?

Thanks
Frank
