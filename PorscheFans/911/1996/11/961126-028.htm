I had a little time to kill this afternoon at lunch so I went out
to my favorite deserted road for a blast down the twisties. I have
an Escort Solo5 radar detector but I I had put it in the glove box when
I parked this morning and forgot to remount it during lunch. I was
accelerating hard out of a tight left hand corner when I heard my radar 
dectector going through its systems check in my glove box (for those that
don't know the Solo5 is battery operated) I was already going into the next 
corner and I didn't want to back off so I let it stay on, when I came out on
to the next straight away the detector started to beep, I quickly slowed down
and found a cop around the next turn.

I always thought it was a great radar detector but damn if I thought it 
would pick up a tax collector from my glove box.


Oh I changed the oil for the first time in my targa (myself that is) and let me
give all you newbies a hint, make sure the drain plug doesn't fall into your
drain pan, because it will plug the hole on the drain pan and the oil is 
comming out damn quick, I dumped 6 quarts of oil on my drive way last night
for that very reason.
