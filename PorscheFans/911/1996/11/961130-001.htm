I noticed in the latest issue of some automobile magazines, Nissan, under
it's "rejuvenated retro-image marketing campaign", has a three page spread
(titled "Enoy the Ride") featuring a picture of a beautiful (but not
production "stock" by any means) 1972 Datsun 240Z and announcing "we've made
it easier to acquire the vehicle that redefined the sports car for
America-just visit one of the showrooms listed below"...(a total of ten
dealers!).

In small print at the bottom, "Vehicle shown is pre-owned and not necessarily
available for sale".  (talk about deceptive advertising!) 

Porsche tried something similar with their "the entry level Porsche is a used
Porsche" campaign, which at least to my understanding was a "bust". (Perhaps
 they need the ghost of Ferdinand Porsche "discovering" the 1948 Porsche 356
#1 roadster in the tasting room next to the wine barrel at Heidelberg
Castle...or is that where Ferdinand Piech had prepared the "secret" resting
spot of the now-departing Senhor Lopez!).  Lately, Porsche has modified their
ads focusing more on late model Carreras and Carrera 2/4 (964)models.  Again,
I wonder about the potential success of these advertising campaigns.

Is there really enough appeal in these ads to draw interested
(eh...knowledgable) buyers into selected showrooms and then sell them
something else in the product line, particularly with no more "new" 300ZX's?
 I see fewer early 240Z's around than early 911's.  The cost of even
"moderate" restoration for resale would seem to far outweigh the
value...other than "deceptive" advertising.  And later 260/280Z's (and yes I
owned one at one time in the mistaken impression it could substitute for a
Porsche) are "junk" compared to the graceful simplicity of the original
Datsun 240Z.

Perhaps those subscribers living in metro-areas have a different perspective
on the potential success of this marketing campaign (or did Nissan miss the
boat and not learn from similar, but not as extensive or presumably
expensive, ad campaigns by Porsche?).  Awaiting News at Eleven from the urban
jungle....
