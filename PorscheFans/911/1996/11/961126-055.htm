Dennis, Pfans,

I am not an expert here, but besides the rocker ratio issue, I would be concerned 
about scratching the cam lobe with a stainless steel feeler guage.  Since the valve 
end of the rocker pushes the valve stem straight in, instead of rubbing accross it, 
minor scratches there sould have no effect.  However, scratching the cam lobe even a 
little, can lead to uneven erosion over time, and distortion of the cam shape, not 
good.

Anyway, that's my $.02 on the matter, sorry I couldn't help w/ the edification, 
however I abound with opinions.

Subject: Valve adjustments - what is probably a dumb question

I have been fretting over the valve adjustment process for my 911, and
basically the more I look at how it is supposed to be done, the more I
wonder if there is an easier way.
Question that comes to mind is why is it necessary to measure the gap
between the swivel and the top of the valve stem (waaaaay down in the
cylinder head...where neither man nor feeler guage ought to have any
reason to visit). Why can't the gap be measured between the cam lobe and
the rocker arm...right out where it is nice and easy to get to.

My theory is that if one presses on the rocker arm so as to press the
swivel tightly against the valve stem (which would result in zero
clearance there), and assuming that the rocker arm ratio is 1:1, there
ought to be the same gap between the rocker and the cam lobe as there
would be if the cam lobe were pressing against the rocker (in the normal
measurement process).
I realise that one would need to make sure that the cam was in the
correct position, and if the rocker ratio was not 1:1, there would need
to be an appropriate compensation for the difference...not too
difficult. I also figure you would not want to press too hard as the
valve would open a little bit and thus give a false reading, but a
modest pressure ought to take up the clearance on the valve side while
not having enough pressure to open it.

....what is wrong with my theory?? When I set my valve clearances the
other day (yes I did it the traditional way...very time consuming), I
did a couple of checks on valves I felt were properly set and the
clearances seemed to be the same both ways....traditional and between
the rocker and cam lobe.


I look to the esteemed minds on the list for guidance and
edification....
