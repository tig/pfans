HI George,

The new edition of the Porsche 911 Performance Handbook still starts with the
beginning of time it is just expanded and updated to cover all that has
happened since the first edition cam out nine years ago. A lot of the photos
are changed so that the new book will have an all new look, but it still will
cover all of the models. The only thing really different on the older models
is the author has changed his mind on some things a the original had a huge
treatment of the 935 which has been cut back some to provide room for the
newer cars. I think that you will find that it is a pretty even handed
treatment of all 911s. It is more modern looking as it has a sans serif type
face this time around, which I find also makes it easier to read. There are
even new mistakes for the nitpickers to point out to the author, some
contributed by the author and others by the publisher. I don't think that
there is any reason you would have to have the older version other than if
you are a collector and have to have one of everything. 

The buying section of the book (now called Buying a Used 911)  has not
changed much from the original edition, but it has been moved up to section
II. I hope that you find the book helpful.

Subj:  What years does the new book cover?

Bruce,

I am under the impression that the new book starts with model year 84 and
covers to present day. Is this true and would this book be of help to someone
looking to purchase a 75-83 911 and how?  Didn't want to make this a book
review but after the responses I received personally to my post some
clarification would be helpful to know what to expect when the new books are
released.

Warmest Regards....
George
