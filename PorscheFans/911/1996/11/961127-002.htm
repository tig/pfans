In the mid-seventies a solid plastic top was standard with the european
Targas (source: Marke Haab, "The 1974-1989 911 912E & 930 Porsche"). A guy
had one for sale at our PCA swap meet a few weeks ago for $700. The top
will only work on a pre-86 Targa because it doesn't use the cab roller
system.

The guy claimed that the top would fit in the trunk of the early Targas
that don't have the large brake fluid reservoir and booster. I've never
seen an aftermarket top. I'd like to have tinted safety glass myself ala
the newer sliding roof Targas (probably cost more than my car is worth!).
