Can't resist this.

I absolutely agree with the post about going fast only on the track.  I am on
the track at least 20 days per year instructing with PCA and time trialing.
 I havent had a speeding ticket in 20 years.  I believe the issue here is one
of maturity and testosterone controll certianly not skill, intellegence or
courage.  The comments about bikes vs cars are an example of the problem not
the solution.  ie. " You guys in cars should know we are faster  and it's
your fault if you try to stay up with me.  I have nothing to do with this"
  Quotes are my interpretations. 

However...

Performance is not mesured just in accelleration.  Check out the recent Bike
Vs Car test in Road & Track or was it Car & Driver.  Power to weight is the
only thing a bike has going for it.  If the car is willing to give up all the
creature comforts and safety that the bike does not have to begin with and go
for pure horsepower, power to weight is  no longer  an issue.  Check out your
local drag strip. I don't think driving a AA Fueler to work is a good idea
though.  I use to ride a bike years ago untill an oil patch on a freeway off
ramp showed me the error of my ways.  Besides driving down the road with my
best girl enjoying some good music all nice and warm in loafers jeans and a
sweat shirt on a 35 degree day in the rain makes the extra cost worth it.
 But I assume you don't consider that performance either.  

I would not race a bike on the street ever.  But, if you would like to try an
autocross well....particullarly if it's raining.

Hope the road is always strait for you

Bryan
