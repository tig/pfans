Hi Rob,

I think that you have a bad thermostat. Either that or a smashed or plugged
oil line.

I hope someone could take a minute and help with a legitimate 911 
problem that I am having with my engine cooling system and stop 
blasting back and forth over boxster fotos.  The Porsche dealer can't 
fit me in for a week so I am trying to do a little self diagnosis 
before I get there.  This list has always helped me accomplish this.
So far a few people have given me a good start. Thanks, Drew, Henrik, 
and Dodge.  But no Bruce A.
Please Bruce, I'm begging now.
I have determined that I am getting no oil flowing to the oil cooler 
on my '90 C4 after driving it for 30 minutes with the temp guage 
registering over 50%.  I took the front wheel well cover out and 
touched the hoses and they were ice cold.  Could I therefore assume 
that my oil cooler thermostat is the culprit with 100% certainty?  I 
figure if it is, I could order one now, and it would be here when I 
take my car in and not have to wait.  Since the dealer does not stock 
this part.

Thanks,

Rob
'90 C4<
