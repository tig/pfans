I don't know if this list allows sales, but I have a 1970 911T that I
have to get rid of (have two kids now, no time or money to work on
the car) I want somewhere between $4000 and $6000 for it....it's a
pretty stock, slightly neglected, Califorina car and until recently
was a daily driver...I think it would make a great driver/project car
for someone with the time to work on it.....the engine/transmission
are strong, but it needs paint, a window mechanism and a turn signal.
Everything else seems to be very original and working. It will be in
Iowa about the first of the year. Please call me if you're interested
(i'm also willing to trade it for a four-door grocery getter).
