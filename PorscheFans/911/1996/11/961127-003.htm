Alan Herod asks
 
> I recently purchased a '83 911SC.  The "Cookie Cutter" wheels look good 
 from a distance, but on closer inspection are in need of some 
 restoration.  The black centers are fine.  The silver annodized/clear 
 coated part is chipped, corroded, checked and scratched.  Can I remove 
 the clear coating and polish the silver parts?  I have done this before 
 with smaller annodized bike parts with no bad effects other than higher 
 maintenance.  It's clear that the integrity of the coating is already 
 compromised.
 
 You could try to spray some clear lacquer on there yourself, but to do it
right, you should send it out to a pro. 

I once bought some perfectly good Fuchs alloys from the Porsche repair
department because some owner had decided to clear-coat them himself. It
started flaking and peeling. Eventually wound up getting new ones instead. 

There are a few good shops specializing in wheel restoration. Robert Wood in
Los Angeles is at 1-310-473-6649, fax 1-310-473-9672; apparently Robert Wood
is no longer at Robert Wood, he sold the old business bearing his name and
now runs a new firm called Wheel Enhancement, 1-310-836-8908; fax
1-310-836-8924.
