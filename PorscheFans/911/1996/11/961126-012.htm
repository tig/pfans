Hi weekend Pfans:

If this is late, flame the E-mail gods (not the listmeister, please). 
All my messages to PorscheFans since Friday has been returned. (If this 
goes  on, I may have to take the hint.)

I just got my dream RS America last week, so on Saturday I began to
dissasemble it. Actually, just the funky radio a European Blaupunkt the
PO installed to fill the hole (thanks, Scott). It works fine except the
three band radio is too far from Germany to pick up any stations. I
bought a simple Sony reciever to replace it with and now I am totally at
a loss.

Can anybody clue me in on the radio-related wire identities for a the
C2? Heres what I have so far:
Red---Battery-direct
Brown---ground
Red w/ black dotted line---Accessory (switched) power lead?
Green---???
Thin wire bundled with antenna lead---antenna booster power lead?

Also there is the small matter of the alarm. As currently wired, the
alarm functions only when the radio is on, not so good for the
batteries, or security.

How is the alarm attached to an aftermarket (or factory) radio? What do
the alarm leads look like?

Will I be in my grave and the car a pile of rust and plastic bits before
Haynes publishes a repair manual? Wait, I already know the answer to
this one.

OK, its the weekend and you are playing with your Porsche, too. So if
you have any (no I won't say "leads") helpful hints and encouragement I
can wait until you return to the office and have more time to answer.

It's Guards Red, but I'm toying with adding white wavy stripes across
the hood and a big blue patch with white stars on the right rear rump.
