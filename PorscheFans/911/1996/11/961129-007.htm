Greetings PFans- 

Just wanted to say thanks for all the good tips on bleeding brakes 
that passed across the pages a month or so ago.  I was having 
some pulling to the right in my '70 911T and decided to change the
 brake fluid.  Well, one thing led to another and I decided that I would
use that master cylindar rebuild kit I had sitting around for 3 years.  
The tip of opening up the lines and "let gravity do the work" really worked.
 I've been through the "pump, hold" routine with my SO and now she 
just laughs when I call her name from the garage.  I've got one of those
vacumm / suction devices, but haven't been real pleased with it.  I 
seem to get allot of air leakage around the bleeder screw.  I tried the 
pressure approach and it worked GREAT.  Hooked up my compressor 
set at 20psi to the resevoir overflow and bled each wheel in minutes. 
Replenished with ATE blue, but it still had pulled to the right.  Called 
Zims (good prices) and got two caliper rebuild kits and on Turkey day
 went to work.  The tip to use air pressure to remove the pistons 
also worked great.  Not sure how else you could do it.  No problems 
with the left side caliper where I expected to find a frozen piston. 
I did find a frozen piston on the right side and had to crank up the air
pressure to force it out of it's bore.  Cleaned up the rust on the outer 
edge, etc.  All the pistons were in great shape, no rust or pitting 
(for a'70?).   However, Zims sent me a miss-marked repair kit (for the rear)
so I had to reuse the seals until I can have them send me the corrrect kit.

Thanks for the bandwidth, but had to pass on this great experience. 
Porsche's are fun to work on, but triple the amount of time you think 
it will take!
