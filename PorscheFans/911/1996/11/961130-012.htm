    Perry:

    I think the disclaimer is there specifically to PREVENT
    allegations of deceptive advertising.  After all, the Z-cars
    they're selling ARE pre-owned, and the specific car pictured in
    the ad can't POSSIBLY be available at all ten dealers,
    especially after it's been sold.

    As you say, there are very few fully-restored 240Zs on the road,
    they DO have a certain garceful simplicity, AND -- something you
    didn't mention -- there are a HUGE number of people who remember
    owning (or wanting) a 240Z back in the '70s.

    I was in elementary school while the 240Z was available, but
    from what I hear, it was INSANELY popular.  I think there are a
    whole lot of Americans who'd really like to recapture a bit of
    their lost youth in the form of a fully-restored, warranteed 240Z
    that they can park in their garage next to the minivan.

    As James Earl Jones said in "Field of Dreams":

        They will hand over the money without even a thought, for
        it is money that they have and peace that they lack.

    I don't think you can really compare the two campaigns.  As I
    see it, Porsche's dealer-certified-used-cars program was launched
    at a time when the new Porsches had gotten so outrageously priced
    that very few people could afford to buy them.  The used-car
    program allowed people to buy cars that were almost the same as
    the new ones, but at a considerable discount. 

    Nissan's campaign, on the other hand, seems targeted at their
    customers' emotions, rather than their pocketbooks.  No one who
    buys one of the restored 240s from a Nissan "Z Store" will be
    doing so only because he couldn't afford to buy a new 300ZX last
    year... The cars aren't similar at all.

    In my opinion, the Nissan campaign would be equivalent to Porsche
    dealers selling fully-restored and warranteed 356s... If they
    WERE to do that, wouldn't you be at least a little bit
    interested?
