The RUF was included, I've seen them cost $2000...

The car has all 86 Carrera susp. (the adjust links) and a BBBIIIGGG Mocal
oil cooler mounted painstakingly by myself up front.

The spoiler is WAY too low however;  I can barely put my foot under it. 
I'll probably be looking for a little more clearance in a GT racing spoiler
over this winter.

Take care,

DMA
