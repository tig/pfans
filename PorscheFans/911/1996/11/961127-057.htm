I read the lengthly startup procedure in my '72 owners manual also.  I =
have
found that a normal starting procedures work just as well.  For cold =
starting,=20
I turn the key and let the fuel pump, pump fuel for a half minute or so, =
then
press the gas peddle a few times.  When I turn the starter over, while =
holding the gas peddle down,  the engine will catch, and then I lift the =
hand throttle up to about 2500rpm.  After letting the engine idle for a =
minute, I drive away, and keep the revs up by using the hand throttle =
until the car is warmed up.  Depending on the weather it will take 5 to =
20 minutes.  I consider the engine warmed up when the idle stabilizes at =
~1000rpm, idles smooth, and the oil=20
temp is at 180 degrees.

As far as problems with the MFI system, find some MFI mechanics.  You =
will
get only two sides of the story.  Mechanics that swear by the system, =
and=20
mechanics that tell you to junk it and put Webers on it.

The normal advice of injection systems holds true for MFI systems.  As =
in, one adjusts an injection system (carbs, MFI, or others) to =
compensate for wear of the mechanical engine components.  The Porsche =
MFI is a system that has very little adjustment, so it gets a bad rap.  =
Webers are infinitely adjustable and had a longer life span that the =
Porsche MFI, so everyone has experience working with Webers.

I for one, like my MFI system on my '72T.  I was luckly, in that the =
prevous=20
owner replaced the $1800 MFI pump before I purchased the car.  The car =
did
have a slight miss at idle, and would not idle above ~500rpm.  Once the =
engine dropped a valve, and forced me to rebuild the motor, it runs =
great, as=20
it should.    I guess what I am trying to say in a lot of words, is that =
if the
car does not run quite right, then there are problems with something =
other
than the MFI system.  This is the advice I have received from mechanics, =
and
it held true on my car.=20
