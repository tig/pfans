HI David,

At one time there was a factory fiberglass hardtop, but it didn't go over
that big so you don't see many.

I was wondering if anyone had ever seen an aftermarket metal or
 fiberglass targa top for the 911.  I think this would be a very nice
 addition if it was designed properly.  I don't know if this idea sounds off
 the wall, but I think I would like one for my car.  If I cannot find
 any info on this I may look into designing one myself.  
 
 The benefits may be : Better sealing and weather protection
    Better sound deadening, etc...
    
 It would also save your fabric targa top from excessive wear during the 
  colder months.
  

If anyone has seen or heard of such a thing for the 911, or if anyone would
 be interested in this please let me know.
 
Thanks,
David Jones
