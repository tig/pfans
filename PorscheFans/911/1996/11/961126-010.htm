     I was just wondering if it is normal for my car 1968 911 T to 
     smoke on startup!!!( I know oil will leak past the rings if the car is 
     left sitting for a while!!) Should it smoke if its been sitting 
     overnight or for a few hours???) The car will smoke for a little while 
     until it heats up then it seem to go away??? The motor is freashly 
     rebuild, I still get some smoke if I throtle the car but not always??? 
     I have tried to lean out the idle mixture screws a bit and that has 
     helped but I don't want to lean out the motor too much!!! Does anyone
     know what size jets I should be running in a stock 2.0 litre???
     The carbs are in sinc and other than a some smoke the motor runs fine
     the plugs don't seem to be fouling!!!! Any ideas!!! Thanks AP
