Frank-

It's hard to give advice about a car one hasn't seen.  

That being said,  it's been my experience that a $4K 911 of that 
vintage is going to be a project, lots of work,  and unless you are 
willing to do it yourself, it's going to cost.  Engine overhauls can 
run $10K nowadays (so I'm told), and even if you do it yourself 
it'll be $1500 or so.  I've rebuilt two '72 911's, so I know.  I'm 
always looking for another project, so I have a fair idea of what's 
available for $4K. Unless you're very lucky, like stupendously 
lucky, you're not going to get a reliable daily driver.  As long as 
you're prepared for that, $4K isn't a bad price for a 911 with little 
rust and an engine that actually runs.

Lots of things.  Just like in any other car.  Not enough gas.  Too 
much gas. Erratic fuel supply, improper timing adjustments, 
ignition problems, vacuum leaks...the list goes on..

>Any other gotchas I should look for?

Rust is the biggy.

Good Luck!
