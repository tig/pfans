The weather here has taken a nasty turn. One day last week the daytime
temps here in Orlando were in the 70's and one night it dropped as low as
40--brrr! Time to figure out how the 911's HVAC works. I spent the better
part of last Sunday fixing mine (dirty control relay connector), so here's
the benefit of my experience.

I own an '87 with manual heat. It uses the same system as the automatic
climate control cars with the exception of not having a temperature sensor
in the cockpit, a sensor on the heat exchanger and a servo in the console
between the seats to auto adjust the air dampers in the heat exchangers.

Operation
The two handles between the seats determine how much hot air is allowed
into the cockpit from the heat exchanger. When the levers are down, two
dampers, one on each side, are closed and no hot air enters. When fully up
they allow the maximum amount of hot air.  These levers also control two
switches. When either lever is up (ever so slightly) a small switch
attached to the base of each lever is closed. These two switches are in
parallel and turn on a fan in the engine compartment. This fan is located
on the driver's side on one end of a large black plastic duct. This fan can
also be activated by a thermostat to help cool the engine. The two switches
do not activate the fan directly, but operate through the heating control
unit (a two stage relay with 12 pins) that is located in the engine
compartment under a black plastic shroud on the drivers side of the car.
This shroud is held in place by two large brass wingnuts. The heater
control relay is an aluminum box towards the back of the car. It is held in
place by a bracket bolted to the body. The relay is "hot" when the ignition
is off, so use caution if you mess with it while the battery is connected.

A rotary dial in the center of the plastic console between the seats
controls the speed of two fans mounted behind the kickpanels of the driver
and passenger. These fans are called the "auxilliary blowers". The switch
has four positions (0-off, 1-low speed, 2-medium speed, 3-high speed). The
blowers only activate when one of the two levers switches between the seats
is activated. Both will run at the speed selected by the dial.

The unit on the dash with the levers has two primary functions. The top
pair of  (tandem)levers control volume of fresh air. The lever to the left
adjusts two air dampers in the fresh air blower case (under the fly catcher
in the front compartment). When it is fully right it closes these dampers
(one for each side) and no fresh air enters the cockpit. When fully left
the dampers are full open and maximum air may enter. The other lever
controls the speed of the fresh air blower. When activated, the fan symbol
illuminates (independent of the vehicle lighting system) to let you know
that the fan has power. The speed markings (I, II, and III) correspond to
detents in the switch.

The middle lever determines the proportion of fresh (unheated) air divided
between the upper and lower vents. Full left all air goes to the vents
below the dash, full right the air goes to the vents in the dash and
defroster. The bottom lever determines how much heated air goes to the dash
vents and windshield defrost vent or the vents under the dash. The large
center vent only outputs fresh air or chilled (A/C) air.

Review
Levers on floor determine amount of hot air (left and right control) and
whether engine fan is on.
Switch in center console sets speed of hot air blowers under dash.
Top left lever on dash determines amount of fresh (outside) air.
Top right lever activates and sets speed of fresh air blower.
Middle lever on dash determines where (dash or floor) fresh air goes.
Bottom lever on dash determines where (dash or floor) heated air goes.

Practicum
Cold day, you're fine, she's shivering and muttering "damn Porsche".  Pull
passenger heat lever on floor full-up, turn center knob to "II". Put fresh
air lever (top left) to center to keep fresh air mixing with heated
(particularly if you been up-fix'n der Porsche all day). Make sure fresh
air fan is off by checking to see that fan symbol is unlit. Put center and
bottom lever at midpoint. Tell her if she gets too warm she can adjust her
lever accordingly. She'll be impressed with your adroit manipulation of
complex controls and appreciate the fact that you let her touch the little
lever near the stick.

Troubleshooting
The plastic console between the seats is held in place by four allen head
bolts. The knob in the center (fan speed) is pressure fit. Once the bolts
are removed the console can be lifted out of the way and the switches at
the base of the levers tested with an ohmmeter. Two spade lugs are mounted
side-by-side on the passenger side of the lever assembly. Pull the two
wires off of these lugs to test the switches. Either lever up should show a
closed switch condition.  Recall that this switch controls the blower in
the engine compartment.

To test the auxilliary fan switch, you need to get at the underside of the
console. This is not easy as the wires are fairly short. After the console
is turned over, three phillips head screws hold the rotary switch assembly
in place. After these screws are removed you can examine the switch. It
consists of an illumination lamp and two microswitches that are activated
by a stepped cam as the switch is rotated. They form a binary two bit
value--00, fan off, 10--low, 01--med, 11--high. Test continuity on both
microswitches as you turn the switch knob or shaft.

The control relay in the engine compartment is a sealed unit. If all
switches are good and fuses and the auxilliary fan relay in the front
compartment are OK I would suspect this unit. Be sure that the base plug
pins (12) are clean as they can get grody living next to the engine. If
only one aux fan is working, check the flat-type fuse located in the wiring
harness near the fan (remove the kick panel to access this fuse).  These
fans are "hellaciously" expensive--I was relieved when mine both started
working.

Extra Credit
The automatic system relieves you of the (tedious?) task of moving the
heating levers up and down to regulate temperature as driving conditions
change. This is accomplished by a small motor (servo) located in the
console box between the seats. This servo is commanded from the setting of
the rotary fan dial (which now has 11 positions; 0-off, 1-9 auto temp, and
DEF-heat full on, auto system deactivated). The number setting 1-9
determines a temperature setpoint differential that is sensed by a
thermister above the rear-view mirror and one in the heat exchanger. The
system commands the servo to open and close the heat exchanger valves as
required to maintain the setpoint you select. The auxilliary fans run at
low speed if the switch is set to positions 1-7, at medium speed when set
to 8-9 and high speed when in the DEF (no auto control) position. I'm just
guessing on the auto system from what I've seen in various books. The
manual system has plastic pieces with no function and a lot of empty space
in the console unit so I suspect that the auto system shares the same
rotary fan switch (with different markings on the settings indicator).
