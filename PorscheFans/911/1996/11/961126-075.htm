I spent the better part of Saturday afternoon finding and fixing an
electrical short that made the left running lights burn dimly.   It was the
engine compartment light.('86' 911 coupe)  After finding and fixing this
short, the battery was run down so I jumped it and went for a nice 45 min
ride.  Played with a pristine '88 328 GTS Spider.  ( The guy bought it new
and was out for its monthly run.)

Anyway later that day, going out to dinner and my wife wants to drive it.
 She kills it 3 times getting it out of the garage and driveway because the
cold start system is still not quite right.  After the third time, the car
won't start.  It turns over nicely but no spark.  Since the wind chill at
that time was about -30 F, we opted to drive the other car.
No loose wires, nothing obviously wrong or out of place.
Any likely places to start looking?  
It would of course be fun search down every wire and possible cause, but it
is on the end of the driveway and I am not big enough to push it up the hill
to the nice semi-warm garage. It is 22F so a fresh air, lengthy
troubleshooting session has no appeal.

TIA
