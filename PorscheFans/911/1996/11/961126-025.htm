Vic,

If you have the money, look into Nology wires.  They have an ad in Pano, and
Excellence.  These wires have a resistor on the end of the plug end, and are
designed to provide a very hot spark.  The quote that they gave me for a 911 
was $250.00.  I would like to get a set of these wires but at this time they are
too pricey.  I have been told by a mechanic (with no known interest with the
company) that they work very well, he uses them on his 912 race car.

Todd
