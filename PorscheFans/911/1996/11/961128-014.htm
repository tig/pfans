This is not a stock solution, but it worked well for me.

I had a spare set of front seat belt hardware (from a 1981 911) and I
had a local safety supply outfit do several things. First of all they
supplied the inertia reel retractors out of a Lear jet (turns out they
need to be replaced annually to meet FAA rules so they have a stock of 1
year old ones around), they then provided matching seat belt webbing
(black in my case) of sufficient length to provide a 3 point harness for
the back. I had to cut down the latch assembly by taking the thing
apart, and redrilling it so that the "stub" is about 2 inches long. 
End result was to mount the Lear retractor on the rear package shelf,
very close to the outside, mount the shortened latch asssembly in the
existing inner rear seat belt holes (which are all threaded and ready to
go...just covered with a little plastic cap) and then mount the other
end of the webbing on to the outside rear seat belt holes (again
existing). The Lear retractor has a huge (like 3 inch) thick washer
which will  keep it from pulling out in the event of mishap, also it
operates in any position as it is belt speed sensistive not angle
sensitive (needs to be in case the airplane is upside down I guess)

Result is a 3 point harness which is fine for my two kids....seats are
getting a bit small for the oldest one (10 years) but I feel very
comfortable that it is a safe arrangement. 

The name of the place is Rich Safety Supply ( in Calgary).....I am sure
there are similar places all over.
