0-60 is about 5 secs, but it's hard to do myself (this kind of stuff upsets
my wife!)

I'd estimate the car at 2700lbs...  It's basically a stock 77 911s targa
with SC flares.  I'm running 7 and 9 X 16 turbo wheels with new BFG rubber.
 Tranny and gearing are stock 83 911sc.  

It's pretty funny how much traction this car has.  For fun, I revved to
5000 and dumped the clutch one day to test straight line acceleration.  The
car barely spun the wheels, but instead jumped, jarred. and hopped in the
air before taking off like a shot.  The shock and violence of this left me
with a severe headache!
