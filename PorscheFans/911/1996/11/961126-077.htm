>Steve asked about a couple of wheel brands. Richard suggested he look at the
>AJ 930S replica wheel.
>
>I purchased a 930S wheel from AJ-USA. It is a very sharp looking and feeling
>wheel. However, I returned it for a refund for two reasons. The first was due
>to the fact that it was too close to the dash. It really wasn't any closer
>than my stock 4-spoke wheel, but the 930S wheel rim is thicker, so it *felt*
>closer to the dash. I was afraid that in the heat of autocross or track
>driving that I would be banging my knuckles on the dash. Also, although the
>leather is stitched around the circumference, it is simply glued over the
>spokes and one of the seams on the back of a spoke was starting to separate.
>
>So, I am still looking for a wheel. Some of the nicest wheels I have seen
>aren't made any more. Specifically, the Fitipaldi (sp?) looks to be an
>excellent wheel. (Does anyone have one for sale?).
