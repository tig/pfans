My friends at European Performance Engineering have done a number of
3.8 conversions, and my understanding is that they and their customers
have been quite happy with them.  The pistons and cylinders are made
by Mahle and distributed in the US by Andial.

When you do the conversion, you are adding .2 litres to a 3.6 litre engine
and should probably expect proportionate results.  You do have the chance,
while you're in there, to use a different cam, exhaust, and so on, and those
choices can enhance the .2 litre upgrade

EPE is at 508 651 1316, in Natick, Mass.
