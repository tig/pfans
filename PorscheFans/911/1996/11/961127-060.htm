Hi Vince,

Try Al at Parts Heaven, he had one about a year ago, may still have it. The
Saratoga top is definitely aftermarket and looks it. The factory top is
factory and looks it. 

 The Targa had a one piece fiberglass hard top which is stored  in the trunk
and the folding roof was made available as an  option. The non folding roof
was only offered in 1974 and 1975.  The folding type top had the code M 436
and became standard  again in 1976.

David:

 This question was posted here a few months ago and everyone agreed that 
these hard tops existed, but it seems no one knows where to get one now.  I 
have an old Porsche parts catalog circa 1983 that lists the aftermarket
Saratoga 
top for $849.50.  The material is described as "a special scratch resistant
and 
hardened plastic".  I have not seen any advertised and I don't think the 
company exists anymore.  The description is not really inviting anyway, but I

would like to see what Porsche did for the German market as David D.  
describes.  I would also  like to find something along these lines, so if you
get 
any leads for more than one or any other info please let me know.
