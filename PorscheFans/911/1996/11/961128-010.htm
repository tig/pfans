The mystery is solved, I guess.  While ioio.com was down, I kept trying to
send a message, and it appeared to be rejected.  In fact, it got so far as
my server EACH TIME and was put it a queue which they continued to try to
transmit, EACH COPY of EACH MESSAGE.  When ioio.com came back on line, the
flood gates were opened.  If there is ANY justice in the world, I got them too!

It's your own fault, you see.  I like communicating with you so much, and I
was so frustrated at ioio.com's problem, that I just kept hitting
send.................................................

I guess the answer is when the normal digest traffic stops, we (I) should
stop sending stuff until the traffic starts again.  

If I have caused even a momentary ripple in the slick mill pond of your
life, I am overcome with deep regret.....
