As a motorcycle rider, I need to clarify something here.  Most bike riders
don't give a second's notice to the make of the car they are overtaking.
This is because they know, especially those "ninja-type" bike
riders, (by the way, a ludicrous term applied to all bikes with clip-ons
and side body panels by non-bikeriders) that most sport bikes will grossly  
outperform most cars on the road.

The problem is that when a sports car is overtaken by a bike, they get
their panties all in a wad and try to keep up with said bike.
It is a futile battle, as we frequently see.  Unfortunately, P-car drivers
are among the worst offenders... something to do with embarrassment over
the cost/performance ratio?  That's my guess.

Don't get me wrong... I love P-cars, and am currently in the market for a
'72 - '73 911 or a '69 912.  I will simply be aware of the car's
limitations...

Kim
