HI John,

The best manual is the factory workshop manual and the best sources are MY
Porsche and Stoddard Imported cars.

There is also a good booklet available from Pacific Fuel Intjectton on the
care and feeding of the mechanical fuel injection system. This is a Porsche
book that has long since gone out of print that Gus Pfister copies and sends
out for a small fee. If you need any help with your mechanical fuel injection
my recommendation is that you talk with Gus.

>Subj:  72 Targa Info
Date:  Fri, Nov 29, 1996 11:29 PM EDT
From:  JDSelph@uspis.gov
X-From: JDSelph@uspis.gov (John D Selph)
To: PorscheFans-911@ioio.com

I am looking for recommendations regarding books, reference materials, shop 
manuals etc for my 1972 Targa.
Specifically, I am looking for repair type manuals for the MFI system, as
well 
as restoration information in general.
Right now I am putting the car in running shape and will evaluate it later to

decide if I will do a body-off.  I plan on doing all (well, almost all) of
the 
work myself, so any hints will be appreciated.
Also, does anyone have a set of used manuals they would like to part with for
a 
reasonable price.
Thanks in advance.
John<
