Rob:

Don't know where Bruce is at and I've never thought that anything on an
automotive repair was absolutely 100%, but if you are running above normal
temperature and the front cooler is cold, you've got about a 98% on this one.
 These fail quite regularly.  When you order the thermostat, make sure that
you get a new "o-ring" seal for the cover.  All you need to change this part
is the tools needed to remove the left rear section of the rocker panel
(phillips and 10mm socket/wrench) and a set of internal snap ring plyers.
 The thermostat is below the oil tank right by the drain plug.  You will
loose a lot of oil, so be prepared to either drain the tank, or clean off the
area and be quick.  Make sure that you watch which was the thermostat and
spring come out, because putting it in backwards forces all of the oil
returning from the engine to go through the pressure relief valve in this
unit.  Makes the crankcase fill up with oil, sinc ethe relief valve is not
very big.  On a scale of 1 to 10, this job is a 1.
