 I'm the fairly new owner of a 1976 Euro 911S VIN #911631xxxx and the car has
 a 930 body type.The flairs,fenders, and whale tail are all metal I'm
assuming
 (WHOA),make that guessing, that it was a aftermarket job  and on the back of
 the car it say's bb930? Someone told me that a company named Boston Brothers
 (bb) probably did the conversion. Does anybody know anything about the
 company? Still in business? ect.  Thanks >>

I believe what you have is a conversion by Buchmann of Germany.  They did
conversions at least through the early 1980's.  Last car I saw by them was a
Turbo Targa at the 1983 Frankfurt Auto Show.  AMR and Record also made 1/43
scale white metal and resin model kits of their conversions.  Believe all
three (certainly the last two) are out of business.
