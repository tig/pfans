the H5 (9004) pattern and bulb are relly poor no matter what wattage bulb
are placed in the lamps.. if you are upgrading the original lamps to a
higher wattage you may want to build a new wiring harness for the bulbs..
the original one on my '90 looked a bit small... the way to do this without
it becoming a massive project is to run a line of a heavy awg gauge line to
each socket with a relay in line and the original headlight leads to turn
the relay on... this way when the new higher wattage bulb asks for juice,
the flow is there...  or just get rid of the lame H-5's which comply to
rather strict D.O.T. laws and get some H-4's .. these are really superior
in all aspects...

.....unless you don't mind over-driving your headlamps @ 120....
