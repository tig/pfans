        My 3.6 L. engine is equiped with what appears to be round metal
rings that fit into a notch cut around the exhaust port in the head. 
        I have changed to headers and find that these rings do not appear to
seal tightly. When I removed the headers in search of the problem there were
carbon traces on the face of most of the header flanges.

        The leaks seem to disappear for a while following re-installation
but are now back again.

        - are these rings only usable once? (at $15 each, I hope not)
        
        - has anyone tried replacing them with standard gaskets? (I am
concerned           about the ring groove in the head allowing erosion of
the gasket)

        - any other ideas for a fix? I can only think that the thinner
header           flange allows distortion and I lose contact with the
sealing ring.

        I have to believe that the guys racing these engines have come up
with a different approach although perhaps with open exhausts the problem
isn't as noticeable or critical.


        Thanks for your help.

        Gary
