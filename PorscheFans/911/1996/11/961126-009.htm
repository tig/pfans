Frank ,

Poor idle could be due to something simple or something rather expensive. Until the 
thing is warmed up and  driven relatively hard, it will be almost useless to  speculate. MFI 
911s are not known for  smooth operation before the engine is warmed up.  Once 
warmed up they should idle very nicely though. 

The start up procedure for one of these things is weird.

From the 1971 911E owners manual (4618.23 1   M XI/69   edition VII/69):

"At all temperatures pull the hand throttle lever up to stop. Do not move the throttle pedal 
at any time during the starting procedure. Once the engine has started let it run 
momentarily in the the above mentioned hand throttle position, the brisquely depress 
the throttle pedal to to bring the engine to approx. 4500 rpm. {yes fans this is with a stone 
cold engine!} At this moment, release the throttle pedal and push the throttle lever down 
so the engine idles at about 1200-1400 rpm. As the engine proceeds to warm up and the 
rpms begin to rise, make appropriate hand throttle corrections until it is finally pushed 
fully down"

The oil pressure should be at least 60 psi during this time. The time it takes to reach the 
fully depressed throttle lever position could be 5 minutes in the summer and 15 minutes 
in the winter. I wait until the idle is smooth and the rpms quit climbing. Last Saturday at 45 
deg F this took about ten-twelve minutes. I went through four 1800 to 4500 rpm cycles. If 
you don't wait until the throttle lever is near the normal positon, the engine bucks pretty 
badly between 2000-2500 rpms. Clearly Porsche is not afraid of high rpms on a stone 
cold engine, but this gives me the "willies" .  4500 rpm on a cold early 911 engine  is quite 
a bit of excitement with the noise and copious smoke associated with the first 30 
seconds of operation. No sneaking away with a MFI 911! Soon-to-be first time 
passengers get a funny look on their face when they watch their first cold start. I always 
say something like "this is a high-performace sports car and starts more like a race car 
than a normal car - heh, heh" and simle reassuringly. My wife always yells "Clear!" when I 
start the 911 cold as she says it reminds her of starting up an airplane engine. The 
colder the temperature the longer my car has a rough idle. But it is never rough for more 
than a minute  as the engine races up towards the 4500 rpm mark.  Eventually it gets 
smoother and smoother and then I drive away.

The manual also says

"Starting Warm or Hot Engine - Depress throttle pedal fully {yikes!} to the floor board and 
actuate starter. When the engine has stared release the throttle pedal"

You would have to have died during the start up not to release the throttle pedal!  The 
engine sounds like it is about to explode. I guess it is a test of driving skill to see how 
quickly you can release the throttle pedal. Anyone with a slow foot destroys the engine 
before they can drive away!

Here again, this is not an inconspicuous procedure. People think you are either 
completely inept or showing off.

Poor idle could be:

1) fouled /shot spark plugs or even mis-gapped plugs
2) needs simple tune-up ( some sort of distributor problrm)
3) worn distributor shaft
4) leaky seal causeing oil in distributor
5) MFI not set up well
6) shot(leaky) throttle bodies or badly  aligned throttle linkage
7) failed cold start circuit
8) MFI unit needs to be rebuilt again (this time by someone who knows what they're 
doing)
9) bad fuel from sitting around too much
10) poorly adjusted valves or worn valve train/ cams

It would be helpful if the mechanic has some prior experience with MFI Porsches.

Rust: The battery box areas and front trunk pan are real watch out areas. The wheel 
wells collect a lot of junk. Rust around the headlights and tail lights is common. Look 
under the carpets too. The recent repaint kind of scares me. Take a magnet and  watch 
out for a quick bondo disguise of serious rust trouble. Fresh looking chassis 
undercoating can be a real warning signal as well.

$4K is about $11K too low. A poor 1969S should go for $7K and an excellent one brings 
up to $17K. ("Excellence", Vol 60  p99 April 1996). The $4K asking price means either the 
owner is misinformed, or this car needs major engine and/or chassis/body (rust) repairs. 
On the other hand if you spend $3K then you can invest another $14K getting the car to 
be just right. The engine could easily eat up $6-8K which still leaves $8-6K for the 
interior, chassis and body. You just have to be dedicated and patient. Of course you 
could be better off paying more for a properly documented example in good shape - 
they are out there.

Best wishes and good luck,

Bill
