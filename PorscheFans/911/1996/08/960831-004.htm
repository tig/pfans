I recently went through something similar. I originally started looking at
early 911's and as I learned more about the changes over the years, settled
on more 911 than I could afford and have been quite satisfied. The main
thing is patience and information gathering. Your 911 is out there and if
it turns out to be the first one you look at then Ferry has certainly
singled you out amongst the masses.

A good place to look is the Excellence issues with the "Used Porsche Market
Report" articles (I may have that title screwy, Bruce?). After you locate a
car that seems reasonable, post here for advice from current owners of that
year or close to. I would strongly suggest that you don't rush into
anything. I would wager that there are far more guys out there who are glad
one got away than there are that are regretful that one got away. I fell in
love with an '86 Targa and thank Ferry that I had a mechanic look it over.
After he pointed out innumerable things that I would not have discovered
until long, long after the sale my fiery chariot began to look like a
broken down VW beetle. Caveat Emptor!
