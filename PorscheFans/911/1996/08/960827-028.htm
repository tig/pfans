I haven't heard or used anything that claims to galvanize metal out of a   
bottle but have used several rust inhibitors and latex sealers with   
generally good results.  In airplane land corrosion is a real problem to   
an airframe so zinc chromate primer is pretty common.   I've also used a   
product called ACF-50 which is a non drying liquid that is sprayed into   
wings and under floors.  The bad news is that this kind of stuff   
continues to run out of panel joints and make a mess on the outside of   
the fuselage.  I also don't think it works any better than the results of   
a good hydraulic leak.   Another product I've used and like is a latex   
liquid that is brushed or sprayed on to existing rust.  It seals the area   
and prevents additional oxidation.  Works well in areas that don't   
require a smooth finished surface such as floor pans, or splash panels.   
 It has the added benefit of being easy to get and relatively cheap.   
 Goes by the name of Extend and can be had in most hardware or auto part   
stores.
