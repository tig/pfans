Just came back from the Portland Race, more on that later.  Brian Barrington, 
from GGR, was driving a 73 911 Carrera RS which had been in storage for quite 
a while.  During a practice session, he had a flexible oil line blow.  He shut 
the car down and was able to get a replacement part.  When I saw the line that 
blew, I realized I had seen the same failure on another 73 911 at a track 
event last year at Laguna Seca.  The oil line is the one that comes out of the 
engine at the sending unit and goes forward.  It has a flex hose that is 
pushed into a fitting and crimped.  It was obvious that the hose wasn't pushed 
all the way down to the base of the fitting before crimping.  In fact, it 
looked liked only 1/16 of an inch of end of the hose was crimped.  It should 
have been pushed about 1/2 inch furthur into the fitting before crimping.  It 
also looked like a new line.  The line was on the car when they bought it so 
they had no history on it but it did look like it was very newly replaced.  I 
think, Jeff Jensen(?), who was on the old pfiles list owned the car that blew 
the line at Laguna and I believe that there was some discussion about this on 
the list.  I don't know what other year 911s use this same part but if yours 
is one of them, and you've recently replaced this part, you might want to give 
the line a good tug at the fitting to see if it comes off in your hand.  
Jeff's engine had just been completely redone and it was it's first time out 
with all new oil lines.  Fortunately, he didn't do any damage. 
 
Another friend showed up at the track without his car.  The week before he had 
a cage welded in to replace the roll bar.  The shop that did the cage had 
disconnected an oil line and plugged it with something to keep it from 
leaking.  When they finished the job, they forgot to take the plug out and 
managed to reconnect the line anyway.  Larry picks up the car and decides to 
drive it a bit prior to leaving for the race.  Yup, seized the motor...... 
 
Not a great weekend for oil lines.......
