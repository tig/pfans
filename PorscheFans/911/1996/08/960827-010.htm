Now might be a good time to remind all that my son has a set of Fuchs
wheels, 4 1/2 x 15 for sale -- very good condition -- and very suitable for
speed events on a 993 or similar car.

The strength of these wheels has been enhanced by constant immersion in
total darkness over the last 10 years. When matched with Nitto (pronounced,
"neat-o") NTR 2000RD tires, you would have that unbeatable combination (as
proven by countless hours of testing in the South Bay hills by the Wing
Commander) of less rolling resistance and no coeffient of friction, that
latter of which would virtually guarantee that the wheels would never crack
or bend as a result of virtuosity on a race track.

What's more, the width (4 1/2 inches) these wheels would also make the 993
a perfect entry for Saturday night cruise events, especially if the
suspension were equipped with a hydralic jacking device. Plus, you would
gain valuable storage space in all four fender wells.

Call today -- operators are on duty.
