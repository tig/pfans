Some update on my 964 with a lightened flywheel! (Thought
you'd seen the end of this, didn't you?)

As I mentioned in my last post, the sudden stall problem
with the lightened flywheel did indeed rear its ugly head
on my car, but only rarely unless the A/C was on. If the
A/C was on, it would die almost every time on de-clutch
above 1500 rpm with throttle off deceleration. It would
idle normally, and if a bit of gas was kept on to let rpm
fall more slowly, it would not die.

Someone had mentioned that Windward Performance had a fix
that did not involve a new (expensive) DME chip, so I
called them to see about ordering this part. It turns out
that there is no part to order. They sent me a fax with a
simple diagram and simple instructions that describe how to
put a 1/4 inch piece of 1/4 inch I.D. rubber hose over the
part of the throttle which contacts the idle microswitch.
It looks like this holds the throttle open just a wee bit
at idle. Whatever it does, it has eliminated the stall for
all but a fairly narrow band of circumstances with the A/C
on, and does not seem to have affected idling or
driveability. I suspect that with a DME chip modified to
help to, the problem would go away completely, however for
now I'm satisfied with this little fix.
