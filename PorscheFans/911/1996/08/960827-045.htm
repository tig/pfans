Got my C4 back from the mechanic last week. Oil was changed
since engine was out of the car. Since getting it back, I
have noticed small oil drips at the right rear of the
engine, and on three occasions a big plume of blue oil
smoke immediately upon a cold start. Smoke disappears after
15-20 seconds, and none is present on hard acceleration or
deceleration. In fact, smoke has only appeared on a start
after the car sat for a couple of days unused. I checked
oil level, and it was way too high. Tonight I removed about
3 quarts to bring level down to the top mark on the
dipstick. Does it seem likely that this plume of smoke, and
maybe the little oil drips, was due to an oil overfill? Is
there a way for excess oil to drain back down into the
heads and crankcase if overfilled?

Thanks
