Hello all!

This is my first posting to this forum.  Currently I own an Audi
Quattro and an Alfa Spider, and together with my boyfriend (a die-hard 911
Carrera owner who belongs to this list), I've been participating in track
and autocross events for about the past year.   I've finally talked him into
going 'halfsies' with me on a vintage racing (!!!!) project, but in order
to do that, we need to come to an agreement on a car which we will both
enjoy driving!

Here's the clincher:  he is a staunch advocate of the 250 hp 6-banger
engine, with typical hot-shot modifications the testosterone-infused of
you will appreciate.  I, however, would like to have a car whose
overriding quality is one of smoothness (cornering and in chicanes), even
if it means loss of horsepower.  I've been thinking about a 914 or a 912,
and he is leaning towards an early 911.  I prefer more emotional cars
which respond evenly and require some finesse, whereas he prefers a setup
with eye-popping performance, even if it means a little man-handling.

Currently, his '84 Carrera is set up fairly stock, with Fuchs wheels
(225's on an 8" rim in the back and 220's on a 7" rim in the front) and
Bridgestone tires, although it has been lowered just a bit.  It has taken me
at least 7 months to get to the point where I am perfectly comfortable driving
that car -- it is *quite* a handful!  I haven't yet tried it in autocross
(it seems too bullish anyway), and my first official track event (time
trials with the local Alfa club) in the car will be in September.  So I'm
still gaining seat experience, and am not completely familiar with the
car.

I've looked at a few 914's, but so far they've been either total
rustbuckets (not driveable!), or simply sucky in terms of
poor shift-linkage, zero brakes, nonexistent suspension, missing
cylinders, etc. etc. etc.  I can tell, though, that if I were to drive one
that was well put together, it would be a *fun* experience.

So.  Do any of you have any comments on the advantages and disadvantages
of the three cars I have listed in being used as vintage racer/autocross
cars?  If not modified, which of the three would be the most likely to
hold value?  Within a racing class, which of the three would be most
competitive?  Any and all suggestions would be welcome!

Thanks-

Tess
