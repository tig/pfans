Hi all,

I've got a battery drain that is driving me nuts and hope the consenus comes
to a different conclusion (from mine).

Somewhere in the system, is a 124mA drain.  I've pulled all the fuses and
the leak is NOT across the panel.  The leak is not on the starter motor (I'm
assuming that monster cable is a direct line to the starter...), it is in
the same circuit as the fuse panel though.

To continue with my assumptions, since there was not a drain with the
monster cable, that means the ground on the battery is good, yes?

No drain on the engine ground, no drain on the panel containing the coil.
Where IS the transmission ground on a 68 911?  (please don't say on the
transmission :^) - I looked for 30 minutes today and couldn't find it; maybe
that's the problem?)

One more bit of errata - with the ol' multimeter set on "Continuity Check"
and one clip on the battery ground - I get a short on both sides of the
(removed) fuse panel for every light in the car...  So I'm guessing the
steering column switches are dead or dying.  That's more $$$ than I want to
spend...  The only problem I can find with this theory though, is the fact
that ALL the lights still work when they are supposed too...

Any other thoughts and what to check?


Thanks!
