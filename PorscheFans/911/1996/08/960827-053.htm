Bruce,

Thanks for your reply.

If this is a racing car then a racing clutch will be Okay, but if this 
is a

It's a street car which is fast becoming a race-oriented car, ready for 
out Porsche Club of New Zealand Race Series starting in October.  From 
what I understand, you visited NZ and the Porsche Club here, a couple 
of years ago; before I was a member of the club.

street car you had better approach this with moderation. The spring 
center
and marcel springs will allow you to drive this on the street. A puck 
clutch
wit not springs will be really tough for street use. 

I'm not so worried about driveability on the road since I don't use the 
car as a daily driver anymore.  I'm more concerned about putting extra 
stress on other things, engine mounts etc. and breaking something.

A good street clutch wont slip, you must just have a bad clutch. 

It doesn't slip on the street, only when starting from still with 
4000+rpm.  I've altered my start to compensate but still have several 
people pass me off the line.  For the first time at the circuit last 
weekend I thought it slipped during a change from 3rd to 4th although 
only a little.

The stiffer motor mounts will be a lot easier to live with. 

Will these help?  I realise that a stiffer clutch will put more 
pressure on the mounts, so I guess it's a good idea to do, although 
no-one else here seems to think so.
