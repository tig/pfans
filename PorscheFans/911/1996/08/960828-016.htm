Hi Mike,

The driveability is not affected, but you might hear more gear noise with a
spring centered clutch than with the original rubber centered clutch disc. I
would not hesitate to change myself, I think the rubber centered clutches
used in the SCs were a liability. 

The late model Carrera with the G50 transmission uses a clutch design with a
much larger rubber center. The larger rubber center is designed to cope with
the torque of the engine, which is seems to do well - unlike the rubber
centered clutches in the SC they hardly ever fail. Amazing how that works,
when the part is designed properly it works and when it isn't it doesn't. 

No, you cannot use the G50 clutch in an earlier car. The rubber center is
much larger and there is no room for it in the earlier bell housing. Yes, the
splines are also different. This is the wrong part for your car. You have the
choice between the rubber centered exploding clutch and the spring centered
clutch.
