Someone mentioned earlier about clutch pedal feel that was inconsistent 
on a 915/carrera, I think.  The pedal could be lightening up because of 
clutch pieces (ie. spring/rubber) in between the flywheel/presure plate 
area.  When they fall out, you go back to a normal feel.  At least 
until the clutch fails.

Actually, the rubber center reappeared on the 87-89 Carreras in the G50 
transmissions.  It was a more stout variety which was less prone to 
desintegrating.  I don't think it was exclusively used, however.  Bruce 
could probably verify, but the only era of exlusively spring centers 
was '84-86.

As a sidebar, having recently gone from a rubber center to a spring 
center (only because that's what was sent me) I feel safer at the track 
and auto-x, but am now annoyed by how much more jerky the car is at 
maintenance throttle in 1st gear.
