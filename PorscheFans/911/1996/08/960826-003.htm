800 800 GUYS

I instruct for car guys.

If I were a new track person with a porsche I'd much prefer PCA events.

1) They are much less expensive (1/3 the cost)

2) THe level of instruction is far superior for 2 rreasons:
	a) PCA minimum instyructor requirements are MUCH higher
	b) All instructors are by definition Porsche drivers

3) The level of comraderie at PCA events makes them both enjoyable and
social.  You see the same faces again and again and develop
friendships.  At car guys the atmosphere in the lower run groups is
every man for himself, and the students are "customers" not other club
members in need of a hand.  Students also have an attitude that
instructors are hired hands, not perople trying to help them out.

4) There is a lighter studnt load per instructor at PCA events.  Last
car guys event I had 3 students.  THat being the case all I wanted was
or ythe weekend to be over with.  Byu contrast at PCA events I usually
get one student, amybe two in a pinch.  THat being the case I can talk
with the student between run groups and really pay attenttion instead
of hoping for the checkered flag, which ends up benefuittign the
student.

I think I'm done with car guys.  Almost all PCA instructors have left
(car guys was originaly based on a core of PCA instructors, and Kenley
Smith was the track chair for blue ridge region).

lastly, Car Guys people are good people.  Unfortunately they have
pissed off the PCA instructor base and now they really need to stress
the remaining instuctors.
