Thanks to Bob on that incredibly detailed tire account. 

As for the concerns about the EGOD. The groove, from my experience,  
has only really been seen when the tires were inderinflated. When the
tire fist came out, everyone raved about the asymetric sidewall
construction, and some people took that to mean that they could run
_reall_ low tires pressures with the belief that there would then be
more tire on the ground, and hence more traction. What hapened was the
result of the asymetric carcas of the tire. Because the ineer and outer
sidewall are considerably different, the tire develops a "hinge" point
on the contact surface. This hinge point is where the smallest tread
block happened to be. So, a small tread block (lots of squirm), and a
flexing carcas under the tread, heat up that section so much that the
rubber just boils away. Hence, the EGOD.

This is just my understanding of the problem as I have heard from a
collection of experienced racers and tire jocks. I could of course, be
way off base too...
