Hey,

With all of this talk of rebuilding brake calipers, I decided to
tackle the rear calipers of my 911 (something I have been
meaning to do for about a year now).

The rebuild itself was uneventful, but I my informal
brake "testing" on some back roads around here prompts
a question.

My car, both before and after I rebuilt the rear calipers, has
exhibited a tendency to lock the left front first at the very limit.  I
have noticed this on many occasions, so I think I can rule out
road surface irregularities, etc.

Can I construe this as an indication that the "corner balance"
of my car is a little off?  Should I raise the ride height of the left
front slightly, or is it really alot more complicated than that?  I
realize that it is a "good thing" for the fronts to lock before the
rears, but is there some slight adjustment I can make to
delay the onset of locking a little?

My car has never been corner balanced, and I have a bad habit
of doing my own alignments, so it is entirely possible that there
is room for adjustment (although it feels great on the track, so
I figure I can't be far off :>)).

Any comments would be appreciated,
