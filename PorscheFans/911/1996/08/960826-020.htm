Pete doesn't think so, but I think you can.  He's right in that you
have to do the engine and transmission together, but I think if
you are careful and take your time you could support the engine
with a sling from above and gently lower it while pushing rearward
slightly (so the transmission shaft will clear the hole in the
floor tunnel).  

I use an engine hoist to help me put the engine back in, and
attach it with two slings, one at there rear of the engine through
the hole in the center of the rear engine mounting thingy, and
one through the lifting "hook" (I assume that's what it there for.)
near the front of the engine.  If you get the sling l;engths adjusted
correctly you can lift the engine quite nicely.  The combination
of hoist and floor jack make removal and installation a pretty
easy one man job.
