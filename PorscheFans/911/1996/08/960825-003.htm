Yesterday when I was starting my '90 C4, I forgot to depress the 
clutch (bonehead move) and quickly depressed it after a nano second. 
However, when I started it, I noticed now a bad sound which would 
occur when the car idled in neural. (like a piece of metal caught in 
your garbage disposal clanking every now and again) {bummer}.  When I 
let the clutch out in 1st it engages fine, but also gives me a nice 
klank{german} which I can also feel in the pedal.  After driving it 
seems to get a little better, and sometimes it goes away completely.  
But my suspicion is that something broke ( i.e.spring) on the clutch 
disk and I'm going to have to get a new clutch.  What can anyone tell 
me on this?  And what does a new clutch cost, and what would it run 
from a dealer?  

Thanks, 
Rob '90 C4
