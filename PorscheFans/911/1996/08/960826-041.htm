Here's the info I have, but I know it's several months old.

There are two 14" and one 13", that won't apply to Porsche owners.  Other
then that all they have are 205/50R15, 225/50R15, and 245/45R17.  (Sure is
nice to have an old car with 15's)  They have listings for 205/55R16,
225/50R16, 245/45R16, and 255/50R16 as well as several 17" sizes.  But there
is no data listed for them.  The last time I spoke to my local rep, he said
those sizes are not available, and he did not know when they would be.

Tech specs:

Tire        UTOG       Overall   Overall      Tread     Tread
Size                   Width     Diameter     Width     Depth

205/50R15   60-A-A     8.1       23.2         8.0       6/32
225/50R15   60-A-A     8.9       24.0         8.3       6/32
245/45R17   60-A-A     9.5       25.7         9.4       6/32

All measurements are in inches.  I think the UTOG ratings translate to
treadwear 60, and traction and temperature ratings of A.

Here is the text from the paper I have.

Since they started the revolution with the A008 in 1982, Yokohama has been
considered the innovator in ultra-high performance.  Now with the new A032R,
Yokohama's heritage of innovation continues.  The A032R represents
Yokohama's ultimate DOT-approved racing tire.  Already winning in Europe,
the ADVAN-A032 brings racing tire design to the street with new casing,
sidewall and tread compounding that is a direct desendant of our IMSA
slicks.  Now, the A032 has come to the U.S., and American road racing may
never be the same.

* Multi-radius tread profile optimizes contact all the way across the tread

* Two steel belts and zero-degree nylon cover adds strength and improves
handling

* Symmetric tread pattern provides exceptional low-speed corning and brake
adhesion

* Advanced high-grip tread compounds heat up quickly for better cornering
and braking   performance

* 17-inch rim diameter sizes are Z-speed rated, making them ideal for
competition

* Shallow tread-depth design provides high corning force with minimal tread
distorion

* "Aqua Tusk" tread design offers outstanding traction in wet racing conditions
Check with your local Yoko dealer for


That's it, I know no more then this.  I have no connection with Yokohama.
Check with your local Yokohama dealer for availability.  If you don't have a
local dealer, I know Discount Tire (advertised in Pano) has them.  No
connection to Discount tire either.  At least they had the 15" sizes I need.
I have not ordered them yet, waiting until the last minute so they don't sit
in my garage and harden.
