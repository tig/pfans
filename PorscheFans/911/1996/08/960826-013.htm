I had the very same problem twice.  The things fatigued and cracked
right off.  I welded them up twice and same failure twice.  This
time I reinforced them by creating a box channel.
 
The brackets, as you know, are basically a C-section welded to the
frame rail on top with threaded nuts welded onto the bottom.  I
cut a piece of 1/16" sheet and welded it on the open side to bridge
the gap and create the box.  This seems to be holding quite well.
It seems to distribute the bending moment into a compression/tension
force on the reinforced side.
 
I've heard of other guys welding a gusset/web on perpendicular to
the C-section for a similar effect.

But I've also heard that the new replacement sway bar brackets from
Porsche are redesigned to prevent this failure.  You may want to
check them out too see what they look like.
