I don't have much to add to this thread except that I have seen a similar
situation on 356s. Specifically, cracks in repro 356 brake drums. On the 356,
the drums effectively make up the hub section of a two-piece wheel. Somebody
was making repros of the 60 mm Carrera front drums. They did this by CASTING
the things out of ordinary everyday alloy (356 T6 aluminum, I kid you not
there is such a thing). The factory drums were forged by Fuchs out of a much
stronger alloy. The original alloy is about as strong at operating
temperature (400 deg. F?) as the cast alloy is at room temperature. So you
know what is going to happen. The cracks were ring-shaped, on the outside
(visible) surface of the drum, between the hub and the lug bolt circle. Crack
results from bending stress on the outside drum in cornering. If the crack
had progressed all the way through to the inside, the tire, the rim and half
the drum would have come off the car. Once this problem was discovered the
guy making the repros just plain stopped.

As for TUeV test standards, I don't have those in any of my books.
