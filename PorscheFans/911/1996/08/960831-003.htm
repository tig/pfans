Hi all:
Since I'm going to rebuild the 1983 3.0 engine anyway and I have access 
to a few turbo parts, I was wondering if it's feasable to reabuild it to 
a 3.0 or 3.3 turbo.  So I have a few questions:

1. Are the case and crankshaft the same for non-turbo and turbo engines?
I know that the connecting rods are not.

2. Can the heads be remachined for turbo valves, effectively turning 
them into turbo heads?

3.  I know that the pistons and cylinders will have to be replaced - how 
about the cam towers, camshafts ( maybe just send them out for 
regrinding), and other miscellaneous top end stuff? 

4. Replace or have fuel injection distributor rebuilt, replace 
injectors, other miscellaneous stuff here - shouldn't be difficult.  
True?

5. Exhaust and turbo plumbing - there seems to be enough stock stuff 
around due to the fact that many people upgrade to aftermarket exhaust. 
 Comments? 

At this point it seems that it would be just as easy to rebuild to 3.3 
turbo specs as 3.0 turbo.  And I do want to keep the CIS.  Is this 
project more trouble and expense than it's worth? 


Am I missing any major details?  The minor ones can be handled as things 
progress.

Comments and criticisms are welcome!
Thanks.

Mitch Feig
1976 911S to be 3.0 or 3.3, maybe turbo, maybe not!
