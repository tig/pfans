I got my tech spec form for the next DEW event. It's a new one. Has the 
usual caution about lower arms on 944/968. There is a NEW caution. It 
says "993 owners, contact your dealer for rear suspension settings."

Called me dealer and he knows nothing. He called Canadian Tech rep who 
also knows nothing. 

Last year I heard a rumor about a potential recall of 993's because of 
some weird condition which was attributed to the SLA rear suspension. 
Never heard anything more. 

Now this note shows up on the Technical Inspection form. Anyone know 
what gives? I'm astonished that Porsche Cars Canada is ignorant. Maybe 
someone from PCNA watches this list? 

I'm not panicked by this, my 993's go very nicely on the track but I 
admit to being curious. Last years rumor was to the effect that if you 
lose it, take your hands off the wheel. The SLA tries to compensate 
automatically and if the driver counter steers into the skid, the SLA 
overcorrects. The story went on that this could be mitigated by 
changing the rear alignment. 

Has this come to pass? By the way the tech form is available on the 
Rennsport web page if anyone wants to examine it in detail.
