Bruce, I noticed your post about the 1979 heat exchangers that Don needs.
Could the heater boxes have been made of carbon steel, and the exhaust pipes of
low-grade stainless?  My 1979 911SC Targa needed new heater boxes when I bought
it 4 years ago (about 85,000 undocumented miles, probably some winters), but
the exhaust side is solid as a rock, as is the muffler.

Don, definitely follow Bruce's advice and look carefully for rust.  The 1979s
were fully galvanized, but that wasn't perfect.  Mine is OK, except in a couple
of areas where I have the beginnings of some rust.  Check up under the rear
fenders where the Targa bar bolts show through.  Also check the forward-most
part inside the rear fenders at the base of the door plates.  Crud collects
there that can lead to rust.   Look carefully at the molding at the base of the
rear window.  I'm just starting to show some rust coming through the paint on
the driver's side.  I plan to take care of this soon.   These areas go along
with all the other usual locations.

Don't forget the 1979 cars should have an air pump.  If you live in a strict
smog state and your pump and plumbing have been removed, it could end up
costing you some serious $$$ to replace.

I think it was Steve Smith that was trying to move the heater boxes you
referred to.  Sorry, but I bought those last week for my car.

Good luck!
