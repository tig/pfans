Hi Dennis,

Interesting diagnosis.  I'm curious to learn what you find. 

When I bought my '72 911T about a year and a half ago,  it ran, sort of, but 
only in one gear.  That's one reason it was so cheap.  I don't even know 
which gear it was.  Either first or second.  When I took off the cover plate ---
drain the transmission first!  Thankfully, this isn't one of those "ask me how 
I know things."  I'm still amazed that I actually thought about it beforehand.  
A miracle, no doubt.--- I discovered that the tabs in the selector rods were not 
lying in the notches of the fork rods.  I've probably used the wrong words to 
describe the parts, but you'll see what I mean when you open the access plate.  
My theory is that the PO, who really knew nothing about cars and even less 
about 911's, tried to force it into 1st gear and managed to pop the selector rod 
out of it's correct position.  I put everything back where it should have been, 
and it's been working just fine, in all 5 gears, since.

It sounded to me like you had the same problem that I did, only I couldn't 
figure out why your transmission would have popped out of gear all on it's 
own, so I didn't say anything.    I guess that's the difference between hobbyists, 
who see only a small number of cars and problems, and professionals, who 
see more in a day that we're apt to see in a lifetime.

Regards,

Bob
