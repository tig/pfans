HI Walt,

The rumors for last year were false and we knew that by July. Porsche had
originally bought in for 1996 and then when the Boxster intro was slotted in
at about the same time in Arizona they begged off. They brought in BMW to
take their slot and deferred until 1997. This years Monterey Historic Race
program stated that Porsche would be the featured marque on Page 64. It says:
"Montery Historic 24 Salutes Porsche August 15-17, 1997." 

You have to be careful with rumors, facts are usually much more reliable. 

I would guess that there will be some sort of a sign up for the parade lap,
that is what they have done in the past. 

The Historics were great this year, as usual we had a wonderful time.
