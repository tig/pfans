Dennis,

I have 1986 Carerra that I have put a Mass flow sensor on.

Shortly after I got my car I installed a European pre muffler (cat 
replacement) with a Borla muffler and a Weltmeister chip.  The car felt 
stronger, or did it just sound louder, than before I made the changes.  I do 
not have a baseline to support this belief.  The changes are worth the 
improvement in sound alone.  It is not obnoxiously loud, just a nice rumble.

The baseline for the sensor is the Glen.  There are two spots on the course 
that I keep track of the RPM's that I am turning.  I am at redline at the 
last right hander of the esses and 5200 at the top of the hill after the toe 
of the boot.

At the beginning of this year I removed the Weltmeister chip and installed 
the Autothority chip and sensor.  It was my perception that the car had much 
better throttle response but not necessarily more horsepower.  After this 
years trip to the Glen, I was still at my benchmark RPM points.  Based upon 
this analysis I would conclude there is not a perceivable improvement in top 
end horsepower, but the around town driving was improved.

Good luck with your decision.


Mike
