I installed on on my '84 carrera turbo-look a few years ago, and was 
almost entirely satisfied.  Car pulled well and smoothly  all the way
in the rev band, starting was not affected, andf it DEFINITELY made
a difference above 3500 RPM.    Also, air filter changes/cleaning
were MUCH easire than the stock unit (I had to unbolt the motor
mounts & drop the engine to gt at the top-side filter housing clips).

Downside (besides cost) was a whistle at light throttle.  Also, the
wiring harness connector is an abomination; you are supposed to 
take the individual wires from the air flow sensor and plug them into
the engine harness.  I found an old Bosch air flow sensorat at a swap 
meet, cut off the wiring connector, and soldered the wire leads from the 
mass flow sensor to it to make a like-factory connector.

Does anybody have any experience with upgrading to the mass air flow
sensor on a 86 911 3.2 Carerra. And without starting a Email war does the
"performance" chip give you much of a feeling improvement.
