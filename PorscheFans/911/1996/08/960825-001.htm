Here's the scoop on odering the polished muffler tip from Brumo's.  1-
800-726-9155.  There is a core charge of $80.00 and polishing chage 
of $49.95.  They send you the finished product and you return your 
tip for a credit.  Several people want to know how this thing will 
look after 6 months of heating, washings, and weather.  I'll let you 
know.  However I can tell you after 1 week, rain and one washing 
there is no change except that the tip darkenned ever so slightly.  
Like going from platinum to white gold appearence.  I'll also tell 
you that the tip they sent me had a good 4 inches of polished overlay,
 as opposed to my tip I took off which had about 2 inches
of polishable area.  I'm a happy camper.
