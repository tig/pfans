Has anyone read the tire article in the latest (Sept/Oct) issue of
Grass Roots Motorsports? If not, and you care at all about proper
tire care on the track, you HAVE to get it.

[grm web page: http://www2.grmotorsports.com/grassroots/default.html]

Basically, the article described how RADIAL tires work with respect to
heat, pressure, etc. 

This article contradicted almost everything I knew (or thought I knew)
about tires. According to the article, almost all of the standard
accepted tire facts are based on the performance of BIAS play tires, 
and does not apply to RADIAL tires. 

Pyrometer tuning - forget about it with a Radial tire. It won't work.
I wasn't sure to belive this or not, but Bob's experience seems to
bear this out. 

Break In - crucial to tire performance AND tire life.

There were MANY interesting facts in this article. I haven't had a
chance to study it, as I just scanned the mag last night, but 
tonight I'll read it closely, and report back tomorrow.

I don't agree that tires should be inflated based on size vs. construction.
I think the construction is much more important than the size. For example,
a BFG T/A R1, with a very stiff sidewall, requires much less air than a 
similar sized BFG T/A ZR tire. The ZR requires more air to keep the tread
from rolling under. The R1's stiffer sidewall compensates for less air.

IMHO, having too much air in my tires (R1's) made them way too slippery
for my taste. With all that I've been reading leading my to try higher
pressures, I raised the tire pressure to 36 hot the last time I was at
Bridgehampton. The result was the car was so slippery that I couldn't
stand it. I couldn't lap faster than 2:01, and the car felt dangerously
unsteady. Bleeding down to 33 psi made the car better, and after
bleeding the pressure down to 30 psi, which is where I normally run the
tires, I dropped my lap times to 1:58, and the car felt much better. 
FWIW, I got over 10 track days from those tires, and no EGOD.
