YaHOO!  Well that's what I yelled out to the neighborhood when the car fired
to life last Saturday afternoon.  I want to publicly thank all those that
sent me advice, but especially Mr. John Tilden, who gave me detailed
directions from his experience.

It turned out to be a defective speed transmitter.  I was (luckily) able to
diagnose it with just my handy VOM, after eliminating MANY other
possibilities.  Upon several list members suggestion, I also replaced the
head temperature sender with the updated unit, since I was working in the
same area.

Jeeze, maybe I'll have to tool up to the TT at Thunderhill this weekend....

Thanks again...
