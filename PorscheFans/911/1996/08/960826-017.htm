I also found the wind noise to be unacceptable.  I had 2 large gaps between 
the top of both front quarter window frames and the targa top.  I just sealed 
the gaps with clear silicone which took care of 90% of the noise.  I put the 
silicone on the underside of the targa top so that it is not visible when the 
door is closed.   I think the other 10% comes from the leading edge of the 
vinyl top.   I can live with it or turn the stereo or revs up.  I also lubed 
the pins which took care of squeaks everytime I hit a bump.   Surprisingly, 
I've been caught in several monsoon-like thunderstorms and it doesn't leak a 
drop.

Sorry, no info.
