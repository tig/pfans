HI Barry,

I don't think the links for the 993 rear suspension are a problem. They are
very hard to bend let alone break. The part must have ither been a bad part
or it was bounced off of something. The links are vacuum cast parts and
Porsche claims greater strength than with forged parts. As a demonstration
they will show you one of the links that has been twisted 180 degrees with no
signs of cracks or deterioration. 

Again, I have not heard of any problems with this rear suspension. When the
GT2 cars first showed up some of the drivers were not pleased with the
initial alignment specifications, but those were revised and all seem content
now.
