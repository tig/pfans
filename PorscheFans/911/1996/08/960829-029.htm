Anyone have any experience with the results of
'blueprinting' fuel injectors? When my mechanic had the
engine out of the car, he asked if I would be interested in
having this done. It sounded like an interesting
proposition, as explained to me:

As the fuel injectors in a given engine age and wear, they
begin to vary somewhat from each other with respect to the
amount of fuel each will deliver with a given pulse time.
Cars with a single O2 sensor adjust fuel mixture based on
the exhaust gas from all six cylinders. As such, some
(half?) of the cylinders will be running leaner than the
other cylinders -  not all cylinders will be providing the
maximum power they are capable of. By blueprinting the
injectors, all six can be made equal again, and all
cylinders will run more closely to their optimum air-fuel
mixtures. Sounds compelling, but just how much difference
is this likely to make? Is there a way to tell if this
would be a wise thing to do, or do you just pay your money
(apporx $20 per injector) and take your chances?

Thanks
