Hi all:
Last night I had just finished buttoning up under the hood with fuel   
lines, wiring and such and rolled my floor jack out from under the car to   
find a aluminum plug lying on the floor under the jack.  The plug looked   
like an oil gallery plug similar to those used to plug the cam cases.  As   
I held the plug in my hand looking over the engine all snuged up with its   
duck work and covers in place my heart sank while I racked my brain   
trying to remember where such a plug could come from.  I checked the cam   
cases (plugs were in) and checked the threads which confirmed that it in   
fact was a 10mm plug.  About that time I looked down at the jack.  After   
a moment I noticed an empty threaded hole for the retainer that holds the   
handle in.  I called it a night and had a little laugh at myself.  I   
guess if I'm still laughing things are OK but I really need to get this   
thing done soon.
