Yup same stuff and I'm not surprised at the price.  The North Shore of   
Boston is death to sourcing anything automotive that doesn't come from   
Detroit or Japan.  Other than dealers In the whole area there is one   
Foreign parts house that wanted $14 for an oil filter for my 911.  As I   
said I'll bet most any CV joint grease would work fine.  Thats why on my   
overhaul pretty close to everything was mail order.
On the other hand this shop has been pretty helpful when it comes to   
information.  Before I took my 911 apart they put it up on a rack and ran   
through about 45 min of checks and gave me a laundry list of service   
items to attend to and wouldn't take anything for it.  Of course if I'd   
bought everything from them I could have bought a spare car from the   
difference in parts prices.
