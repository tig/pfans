I'm in the process of trying to get a 1966 911 up and running and
after it had been in the shop for since April 1995 I was finally told it
was ready to be aligned.  Having turned it over to my mechanic a day
after it was purchased I was excited just to see it move under its own
power.  I had it lowered and installed heavier torsion bars (its been so
long I cant remember how heavy but was on the light end of "track"
stiffness).  I also uprated the anti-sway bars to a complimentary level
but one side was disconnected in both the front and rear in preparation
for alignment.
     On the way home I passed down a street that was being resurfaced
and when I passed back up onto uncut street (about 1.5-2 inches height
differential) at about 20 MPH I heard a sound from the front of the car
that was like metal being hit with metal and a LOUD rattle began.  Upon
investigation I found the front most right torsion bar mount had torn
from the pan on the outside and front with only the inside mount
remaining in the pan.  The metal of the pan was intact but the "Washers"
that are tacked to the pan had simply detached themselves.  Inspection
of the left front most mount revealed stress fractures the metal
supporting the outside "washer" and that the front "washer" was pulling
away from the pan.
     After returning my car I was told that the front shocks were
essentially nonfunctioning ("I could push them up about 8 inches without
any resistance").
     
     Does anyone have any experience with this sort of failure?  Cause? 
Remedy?

     Thanks in advance for any help

     '66 911 (someday maybe)
