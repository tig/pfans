Nope, Dennis I dont :-) In fact, I would like to exchange notes
with you on what kind of living room furniture can be made out
of 120 lbs (one hundre...) of lithum grease!

   :-)

The only resort I have now is to ask the local shell distributor
to request shell for a "sample"; only problem is they all
perhaps recognize my voice by now. :-)

I re-read the factory manual, the threat had not faded away or
anything :) -- "Pilot bearing, NLGI grade 3 lithium, or
else..".  BTW, this is a 924 pilot bearing peculiarity.

I wonder if any of your pholk work for the railroad or avionics
industry ??  Anyone have a tub of Shell Alvania #3, Cyprina #3,
or Mobilith AW3 ??
