There were rumors last year that this was true, and it turned out to
be false.  Do we have any verification about this from anyone?

Two years ago we had a small gathering of Porschephiles at one of the
Monterey-area watering holes after the day's events one evening.  I
would have tried to organize a repeat this year but was unable to
attend.  When the time gets closer to the event next year, I'll again
put out a call, this time for a PorscheFan gathering.

I'll bet a parade lap would be difficult to do with the number of
P-car owners likely to show up unless participation is severely 
limited somehow.  I can envision a five-abreast lineup all the way 
around the track.  The prospect of an LA traffic jam on the track at 
Laguna Seca doesn't excite me much.

I'm a little surprised nobody has reported on this year's events to
those of us unable to attend.  Doesn't someone have some good 1996 
Monterey stories to tell?
