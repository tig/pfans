Now the question at hand,

	I've determined that the repair is doable and will be high quality. Now
I've been trying to see what else I can get done. There is another shop
that could do the job for less, and leave money for some other work.
That other work leaves the question...

"To flare, or not to flare. _That_ is the question..."

	I will have enough money left over for one flare. Which leaves me
paying for the right side flare at $600 including paint. This would be
just for the rear. I plan on getting very smooth flares, and not fery
large. Just wide enough to admit 225/50-15s. However, I'm still torn
here. The main reason (hell, the only reason) that I'm getting the
flares is for SCCA SoloII. In an attempt to get more rubber to the
ground. But the reasons not to flare are there too. Original body, PCA
zone 7 tire sizes etc. Also, it is a '74 2.0, and as such has it's own
value. Anybody out there have any suggestions?
