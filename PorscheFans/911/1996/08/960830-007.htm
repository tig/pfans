Just got the new Car Magazine from Japan.

They have a 'first drive' article on the Boxster, and although my Japanese
reading ability is zilch, there are lots of pictures.

Where this car started out and where it is ending up are opposite points on
the compass, IMO.

The sleekness of the show car was dependent upon short overhangs and a
really 'carved' coke bottle shape. Those are gone. Looks like a kid's
blow-up toy with too much air in it.

The interior shown in the article is hideous!

The show car was very retro. The (hopefully not final production) interior
shown in the article  has less class than a Ford Escort--which it strongly
resembles. It is straight across, a mass of textured vinyl--interrupted
only by an airfoil-shaped opening for the three main gauges, and a black
plastic panel housing *all* the controls--exactly like current Fords. It
looks incredibly cheap.

LIke I said, I don't read Japanese, but I find it hard to believe that this
is not a final production interior--in which case, I'm *very* glad I didn't
put money down on this turkey.

P.S. The same magazine has similar photos of the new Mercedes SLK, which is
more attractive in every way. It even has a 'retro look' interior, although
I could do without the faux carbon fiber...
