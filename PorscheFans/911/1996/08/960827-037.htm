Hi Mike,

Corner balancing (weight checking) 
The purpose of weight checking is to make sure that the weight is distributed
evenly on the four tires. Assume the 911 has a weight distribution of 40/60
front to rear, then 40% percent of the left side weight should be on the left
front wheel,  and so on. Where this is particularly important is on one of
our Porsches that has been in a wreck. If the car does not carry its weight
evenly distributed on its four tires it is said to have weight jacked into
the chassis. 

People that race cars on circle tracks have made a science out of weight
jacking in order to find the fastest way around a race track. This is not the
case with our Porsches and sometimes after one has been wrecked and not
properly repaired they can end up with the weight jacked diagonally across
the car. The problem with this is that when you look at your Porsche it may
appear to set even on its four wheels and it may have even been aligned
properly, but it will have strange handling characteristics and tire wear
because of this weight jacking. Ideally the weight differences should be less
than twenty to thirty pounds but if the weights are more than fifty pounds
per wheel off the suspension must be readjusted for more even weight
distribution or you will feel the effect on the handling and driveability.
Porsche says that the weight difference from left to right may not exceed 20
kg (44.1 lbs.) for the 911 or 10 kg (22.5 lbs.) for the 911 Turbo. They also
say that the difference in height from the left to the right may not exceed 8
mm (0.3 inches) on the rear axle or 5 mm (0.2 mm) on the front axle. 

Changing the height on one side will cause a simultaneous change in the wheel
loading. When the wheel loading is changed for one wheel it will also change
the loading of the other wheels. Increasing the initial setting, or spring
tension, on one side will raise the car increasing the load on that wheel.
Decreasing the initial setting, or spring tension on one side will lower the
car decreasing the load on that wheel. A change in load on one wheel will
always effect the wheel diagonally across the car from that wheel. If the
wheel load is increased or decreased on one wheel the same will happen on the
wheel diagonal from it.
