Does anyone out there have experience with a product called ZRC cold
galvanizing compound.  I sent one of those annoying little card you get in
the mail back for info, and the stuff looks pretty good.

Put in laymans terms, the stuff regalvanizes steel.  It can be brushed or
sprayed on, would be 1.5 ml thick, and can be painted with most auto paint
(not lacquer).  I talked to the rep who said "It was the ultimate primer" and
he had sold some to some Corvette guys for rust proofing the bottom of their
cars.

I've got some of the typical rust spots to correct on my car before I repaint
this winter, and am looking for something to keep the rust away.

Suggestions?
