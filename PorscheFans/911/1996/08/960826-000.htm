    Marc:

    Do what you like, but keep in mind that:

        1) the offsets are WAY different; putting positive-offset
        wheels on the front of your car is likely to negatively
        affect the car's handling.

        2) your existing Fuchs wheels are among the best in the
        world; if you trade them for repro 993-style wheels, you'll
        be paying good money for inferior quality.

        3) the long studs you'll need are very expensive, and
        installing them is a royal pain.

        4) spacers aren't cheap, either.

    993 wheels, as far as I know, are 17" in diameter, so repros are
    likely to be that size, too.

    I think that there's one pair of wheels (911 front/944 rear,
    maybe?) whose specifications are the same, but all the rest have
    different offsets.  Bolt patterns are the same, though, so if
    you don't mind changing BOTH cars' handling characteristics, you
    could put your 911 wheels on the 944 (assuming there are no
    fender-clearance problems, etc.).
