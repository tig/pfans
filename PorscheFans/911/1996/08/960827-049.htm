HI Chris,

Porsche quit using the rubber centered clutches in 1983 and went to a spring
clutch, which they used until 1987 and the G50 transmissions. 

Yes, the rubber came back, but it was the same large rubber as was used by
the 3.3 Turbo and it was up to the job of coping with the engines torque. The
rubber centered clutches used by the SCs were too small to cope with the
torque of the engine and failed. 

I really think, that within reason, the only ones of these larger rubber
centers that have failed have been abused. This in contrast with the smaller
rubber centers used in the SCs which would fail if you looked at them wrong. 

The spring center clutches were used 1983, the last years of the SCs through
1986.
