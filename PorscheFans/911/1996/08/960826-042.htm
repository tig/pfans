On my 944 I used to have Gran Turismo East in Atlanta balance my tires by 
spinning them on the car.  That gave me a real good balance.

When I brought them my 1990 911 C4, they said that they could spin them 
on the car b/c of the awd.

I went up to Rennsport in Roswell about a bent wheel and Robb told me that 
Butler Tire does it all the time.  They have a rack that can spin balance 
them all 4 at the same time.

My questions are:

1) Can 'on the car' tire balancing be done on a 964-C4?
2) Does it matter if I do it one wheel at a time or all 4 at once?
3) Anybody have any experience (+/-) about Butler Tire off Buford 
Hwy in Doraville?

Also, I apologize if you get this twice.  I don't think Netcom sent my 
first one b/c I never received it.

Thanks,
Scott
1990 911 C4
