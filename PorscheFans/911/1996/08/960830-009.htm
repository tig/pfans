As an aside, if the reason for desiring "blueprinted" injectors is to
increase performance, may I suggest that you seek out a source for matched
and/or hand-selected injectors from a source that specializes in this
service. The POC (West Coast) guys do this frequently and I myself have used
matched injectors on my Toyota 4AGE SCCA ITA race engines. Before and after
dyno testing showed about a 10 HP increase from 4500 to 7300 RPM (on this
engine, that's about a 6% improvement). "seat of the pants" feel on the
bottom end/midrange says that the driveability improved as well.

I used RC Engineering in Torrance, CA and was very pleased with the results
and the service.
