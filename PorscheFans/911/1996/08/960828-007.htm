Has anyone had a good expeirience with a performance chip for the 993? 
I have been told by a few people that there are now decent chips 
available. I have also been told that some of them have downsides. In 
one case the factory alarm/ignition kill system is disabled and a red 
wearning light is on constantly. The chip is from the UK I think.

Another increases power by raising the rev limit. Probably not a good 
idea.  I'd appreciate any feedback good or bad on the 95 993 and the 96 
993 chips (varioram equipped).  A few firms are advertising larger 
throttle bodies (stock plus 3 mm).  Smog laws in Canada are not as 
severe as they are in the US so emissions is not a major concern. 
Besides, with a land mass as large as the US and 1/10th the population, 
auto produced smog is not an issue here. Heating fuel is the problem in 
the winter.
