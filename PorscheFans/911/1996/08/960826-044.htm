My first engine action--yow! I got the worst "leaking" one in (passenger
side, front). Any general tips on these, it turned out worse than I
imagined. The C-clip on the two-piece replacement tube doesn't just "slide
into place".

Driver's side: Does the exhaust have to come off?

BTW, I searched the archives and found next to nothing. Is there a
comprehensive procedure in a book somewhere? The service manual does not
have much detail except to put the short end of the tube at the crankcase.

'87 911 Targa
 ------------------------------------------
 Harley,
         I   replaced the oil return tubes on my '87 911Carrera, and thought 
I'd
        pass along a tip or two.
        The new Porsche factory supplied two piece return tubes have
        "improved" rubber O-rings of higher durometer and are very stiff.
        So stiff, that I was unable to extend the tubes by hand. I decided 
that I
        needed  some additional mechanical advantage!

        I cut a pair of 1 inch copper solder sleeves ( Available from your 
local Plumbing
         outlet) in half, lengthwise.
        Cut the length of one of them down so that the pair would just fit
        end to end between the retaining ring and the flared end of the
        inner tube, when collapsed to a length that will just allow 
insertion
        of one end in the case tube bore.

        Install a hose clamp on each split solder sleeve to keep the two 
split
        halves together.

        Assemble the two split solder sleeves onto the inner oil return 
tube, then
        install the snap ring, onto the inner tube, then the two inner 
O-ring seals,
        lubricate with motor oil.
        Slip the outer oil return tube over the inner O-rings until it 
bottoms out against
        the split solder sleeves/retaining ring stackup. Install the two 
outer O-ring
        seals and lubricate with motor oil.

        Install the large oil return tube end into the Case bore and pivot 
the oil
        return tube assembly up to align with the bore in the cyl. head, 
then use
        your large external snap ring pliers (Available at your local Sears 
Store)
        to expand the tube assy until you hear the retaining ring snap home. 
Viola!
        Undo the hose clamps and remove the split solder sleeves, repeat for 
the
        balance of oil return tubes.

        Further hints, I did this job with the heat exchangers removed. I 
highly
        reccomend removing them.
        The Left side front tube can be done without removing the Oil line
        from the case, its just a puzzle!

        911s don't have to have wet bottoms! They just take a little
        maintenance.

       Any Questions?
