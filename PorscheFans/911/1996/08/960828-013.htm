Hi Bill,

Nice to hear that you're settled in and thinking about
getting back to the rebuild.  As for the caliper bores...

I can't believe my luck.  Two days ago I answered someone
else's question about cleaning pistons and bores, and without
thinking told them you didn't have to worry about the pistons
because they didn't touch anything, it was the seal in the
piston that did the touching, and therefore cleaning the bore
was the important thing.  That was the wrong
answer.  But...if you reverse the words piston and bore
in the above, you get the right answer.

So, the answer for you is, don't worry too much about the
condition of the bore, especially the part external to
the seal.  It doesn't affect brake performnace.  Just clean it
up as best you can.  The important part is the condition
of the piston, which you want to be smooth and pit-free.

Make sense?

Regards,

P.S.  Thanks for giving me the chance to say what I said
a few days ago, but this time to say it correctly!
