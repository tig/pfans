Hi Ric,

Just got your post with the morning's 'cup o' Joe' ... the address for the
Porsche Fans List is as follows:

PorscheFans-911@ioio.com

Please note that I have taken the liberty to CC post this to the group. 
The e-mail address above allows you to post, I'm not sure about subscribe,
there are a set of parameters in order to subscribe to the list in either
digest or regular format, and model of Porsche.  I've posted this so
perhaps the others can provide you with more accurate inf. on how to
subscribe if you choose!

Joe
