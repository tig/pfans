Perhaps George B can shed some light on this...George--help me out here??=


I seem to recall that for the 48 Hours at Watkins Glen track event this y=
ear, in addition to requiring stock ride height for 944s, there was a req=
uirement that only Porsche factory wheels or BBS wheels would be acceptab=
le [disclaimer: I may be wrong, once again!]. BBS and OZ seem to make mos=
t of the wheels used in Formula 1, FWIW, but their product lines may enco=
mpass as wide array of wheel quality and strength levels.

There is a TUV standard which I understand is required for wheels in Germ=
any (perhaps Peter Albrecht can comment) which might be at least an indic=
ator of quality (are there multiple TUV ratings, or one standard?).

Also, there is a fundamental issue of manufacturing technology used (cast=
, pressure cast, forged), and design (one, two or three piece) for an int=
ended purpose (street vs. racing).=20

Metal can certainly fatigue and work harden with age and flexing, and in =
the case of the older wheels, it is certainly true that with the suspensi=
on mods and sticky tires we have now, a 1970s-vintage wheel was never env=
isioned to withstand the repeated lateral forces it can be subjected to t=
oday.

So, given the consequences, I would be very choosey about my wheels...

Yikes,
  I am VERY concerned about wheel failure! I have teh 928 Callaway Twin=20=

Turbo and it is in DIRE need of new wheels. The existing BBS Formula 1 3=20=

piece raceing wheels are nice, but they are 15" wheels Which makes Tire=20=

selection non existant I HAVE to use R1s even for the street. It's the=20=

only tire I can get in 265/50ZR15 Which is terrible. I love R1s, but=20
replacing tires every 5-6k miles is horrible.=20

The problem is, of course, the threat of wheel breakage. With the=20
excessive (;>) amount of power this car produces at the rear wheel I am=20=

always concerned with a failure. Leonard laub (also on the list) was over=
=20
an thought I might try HRE wheels. I wish to purchase and mount new=20
wheels ASAP. Of course offset and the like will have to be figured out...=


I would love some recommendations. The only caveat is I prefer black=20
centers to remain "low-key".=20

Richard Miller,
Wondering What a broken wheel would be like at 180mph+ ;-(
