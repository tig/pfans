Hi W.P.,

It is pretty common to have the rear sway bar mounts break, as far back as I
can remember it has been, I am not sure why it took so long for anyone to do
anything about them. Because many people use larger than stock sway bars
which just makes the problem worse a lot of people welded little braces to
the existing sway bar mounts. I notice that Automotion advertised an improved
911 sway bar mount in their catalog so I checked with them to see what their
improved mount was. The new piece is actually an improved part from Porsche
which is a little bit larger than the original and has a butterfly shaped
brace welded on one side. This new part looks like a big improvement and can
be used to repair all of the cars as long as you replace both mounts. 

Your best bet is to grind all of the original mounts off and weld the new
ones on. This is best done by a professional and it would be nice if you
could find someone familiar with the problem with 911's.
