hi Bob,

Are you sure it is for suspension settings, and not just for suspension
inspection? The reason I ask is that at the last autocross I was at,
a club member showed up with the 993TT. He's a novice, and has driven
at about 5 DEW events (I guess that means he isn't a novice anymore) and
drove well. This autocross was a combined event of school in the AM
and autocross after that. After driving the car on the skidpad, some one
noticed the LR wheel appeared to be aimed in (toe in) a great deal. 
The owner remarked that he had just gotten the car back from the dealer,
who complete a four wheel alignment. The owner then took the car for 
a short drive, to see how it felt. It felt bad, and looked no better.
Then we took a look under the car, and saw that one of the lower control
arms (is that the correct part?) was broken. Cracked right in half.
I can't imagine what would have happened to the car if the suspension
broke when he was on the track.

I wonder if anyone else has seen that, and perhaps it's a potential
trouble spot, like control arms on the 944's.
