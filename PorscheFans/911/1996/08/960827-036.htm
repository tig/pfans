Hi Alan,

The 3.2 engines also had no head gasket. I suspect that it was as much the
moving out of the head studs an additional 4 mm as much as the fact that they
did not use a head gasket. We really didn't have any problems with the 3.2
engines. I think that is the combination of the larger stud pattern, no head
gaskets and the rubber head studs that finally caught up with the 964 engine.


The cars built in 1989 (K), 1990 (L), and 1991 (M) had the engines that are
succeptable to a cylinder head to cylinder leaking problem. The early cars
were those built up to 62 M 06836, M64.01 for the manual transmission cars
and 62 M 52757, M64.02 for the Tiptronic cars.During the model year 1991
Porsche fitted their 964 engines with a modified cylinder and cylinder head
gasket or seal. The original 964 engines did not have a head gasket and there
has some oil leakage at the joint between the head and the cylinder. The way
that the original heads and cylinders were machined there was a small gap
left out at the edge where the head studs were. Distortion of the heads
caused by the head torquing from the head studs was believed to be the source
of this leak.
