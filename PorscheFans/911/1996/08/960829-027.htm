After you get some more track experience and start pushing the car hard 
you will find that it runs out of breath at high RPM. You can fix this by 
changing to the 911S heads (bigger ports and bigger valves). You will 
also find that the car runs very hot. You need to do all you can to get 
the temp. down, 11 blade fan, RSR front oil cooler, etc. When you start 
pushing the limit in high speed corners you will find that you need a 
tail of some sort, this also will help keep the car stable when going in 
a strait line at high speeds. Even the Ducktail helps a lot. I could go 
on and on. The spending of money doesn't stop. I have owned 1974 911's 
since 1978 and still have one.
