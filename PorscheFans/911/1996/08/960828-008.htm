Hi Bruce, 
 
Let me describe where it is.  With the rear deck open and looking down at the 
front of the engine, there is an oil line that comes off of an oil sender 
(pressure, I think) unit in the front. The line runs to the right and goes 
forward on the passenger side of the car.  It has a screw on flanged fitting 
to the sending unit with flexible hose crimped into it.  The hose blew out of 
the fitting under load.  Same as the one last year at Laguna Seca.  The owner 
was talking to another participant who ran a Porsche repair shop (Bauer in 
Oakland)and had one of his guys bring up a spare part Friday nite as he was 
coming up for the race on Sat.  It sounded like a stock Porsche part number 
from the way they talked about it. 
 
Hope this is clear enough. Let me know if it's not and I'll call Bauer and get 
the part#. 
 
Ted

Hi Ted,

What oil line is this that you are seeing blow? I am not clear from your
description which oil line you are referring to.
