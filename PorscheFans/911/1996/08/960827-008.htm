Hi 

I am a new owner of an 84 Carrera and am new to the list.  I have been
driving in 10 to 15 track events per year.  I will use my car as a daily
driver and in track events.  My daily drive is short.  I want to set up the
car eventually with T bars antiroll bars shocks etc.  I need to start with
rubber right away though.  I am getting lots of conflicting reports on what
is legal and is best.  The car has 16x6 and 16x7 wheels now.  I want to be
able to run in stock class at least for a while in time trials.  Do I stay
with 16's for my track wheels and use 225-50's in front and 245-45's in the
rear?  Is this legal or do I have to run 245-50 or 255-50's in the rear to be
legal in stock?  Would it be beter to go with 15x7 and 15x8's and  225-50's
in front with  245, 255, or 265-50's in the rear.

Where do I get a rule book?  I am a member of PCA.
