I don't agree. If you use the right combination of studs and spacers, you
end up with the wheel in the same position, regardless of offset.  It seems
like a cheesy way of doing things, but remember, Porsche did exactly that
with the 930 Turbo.

Nearly all of the newer Porsche wheels are inferior to the Fuchs, because
they are cast rather than forged.  There are many aftermarket wheels
superior to Factory Porsche wheels now. Just ask anyone who has genuine 993
Turbo wheels that won't hold air.

Long studs are neither expensive nor difficult to install. For instance:
the 993 comes with the wrong offset on the front wheels, and a common
modification is 21 or 23mm spacers and 66mm studs. I did this conversion to
my car in about an hour and a half, and the price was about $140. The rear
is probably more complicated, but the process is simple, and even a pricey
mechanic probably won't charge more than $200.

993s come with 16" wheels. 17" are a common option. Around here, the 16"
versions are fairly inexpensive.

Generally, you will end up with more negative offset, but beyond that, I
cannot be more helpful.
I recommend you have this conversation with Robert Wood. He has a new
company, Wheel Enhancements, and can answer all your questions and maybe
find you some good wheel alternatives.

Reach him at (310) 836-8908.
