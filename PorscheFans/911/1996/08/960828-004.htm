Been lotsa stuff here about tires. I figured I'd share my experiences 
with you. Tires are on 993's one a C2 and the other a C4S. Both are on 
17 inch wheels. Yes I know the C4S has 18 inch wheels but I bought a 
set of C2T Borbet (TUV approved thank you) for the 4S 'cuz 18 inch 
track tires are either impossible to find or too damned expensive.

Other comments: All tires have good handling characteristics, crisp 
turn in and no nasty behavior at the limit. Makes sense as 3 of them 
as they are factory approved for the car. The others are race tires and 
behave as you would expect. Note that the Toyos need lower pressure in 
front because they have greater volume than factory sizes.  Pressures 
are based on normal summer temps, 75-80 deg F. Track days are mostly at 
Mt-Tremblant which has a *very* abrasive surface and wears out tires 
like mad. 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

Tire        Conti CZ91 205/50 17 255-40 17

Pressure    36 cold drop two in front after 20 mins lappping

Wear        5000 miles on street! Wiped out after weekend at track.

Traction    Very close to Race compound but wears out faster.

Rain        Amazing. Drivers behind hate me though. Big spray!

Squirm      Very little probably 'cuz tread wears so fast.

Comments    The OEM tire on the C2. Very sticky but wear out like art 
gum erasers. May benefit from a heat cycle like race tires. Street 
drivers in club report 4000 - 5000 miles on the street before the are 
gone.                -

Tire        Bridgestone S-02  205/50 17 255/40 17

Pressure    35 cold. Drop one lb in fronts after hot laps.

Wear        10,000+  miles on street plus 8 track days!

Traction    Excellent laps within 1.5 seconds of race compound (2:08.5).

Rain        Excellent.  

Squirm      Deep tread squirms initially on high traction surfaces, 
benefits from one heat cycle before tracking.

Comments    A really nice street and track tire but very expensive. I 
use them as street tires and for really wet track days with standing 
water.                       - - - - - - - -

Toyo Proxes F1S-R  235/45-17  255/40-17 Race Compound

Pressure    26 cold, 35 cold.

Wear        4 track events but MUST HEAT CYCLE first.

Traction    R compound rain tire. Deep tread! 10 track days.

Rain        It's a DOT cheater rain tire, works very well.

Squirm      Horrible on full tread in the dry. Shave them to 6 or 7/32.

Comments:   Very popular in this area as a rain race tire. Wore out a 
set of rears in 2 track days because I did not heat cycle first. Shave 
for dry or spend a track day scrubbing off the excess tread.
    ----------------------------------------------------------
Pirelli P-Zero Assymetrico "C" - Dry 205/50-17 255/40-17 Race compound!

Pressure    35lbs all around drop one pound right front on our track 
after hot laps.

Wear        4 track days so far. Looks like they will go 8 easily.

Traction    C compound is a race tire very similar to BFG R1, traction 
seems very similar. Equivalent lap times to Proxes and BFG R1 and, 
no doom grove. Available for similar prices to BFG R1 direct from 
Pirelli (in Canada at least).

Rain        Very good. Treadwall (60 wear) marked "Dry" probably 
because half is slick and half is treaded (like R1) but stick well in 
rain. Dunno why "Dry"  label. Assume they have a full tread rain tire 
version too.

Squirm      None. Tread is 6/32 from factory.

Comments    Available in factory OEM sizes. Some people (not I) have 
complained that running 235 fronts on a 993 makes the car handle quite 
differently, hasn't been my experience but I am not tail happy and 
avoid trail braking except under *very* unusual circumstances. Pirelli 
says they will be available in 18 inch OEM sizes for Porsche next year. 
Very stiff outside sidewall (assume R1 was the target) driving to the 
track the ride is much stiffer than any of the other tires I've used.
            ---------------------------------------

Tire    Pirelli P Zero Assimetrico 225/40 18 285/30 18

Pressure    29/44 lbs. Drop three in rear after hot lapping 20 mins.

Wear        My 4S street tires and 3 track days too. Tough rubber, they 
            should go 10,000 miles or more including track abuse.

Traction    Very good. Not as sticky as the S02 but a nice trade off.

Rain        Very good. Makes sense, Factory OEM on 4S and Turbo.

Squirm      Very little on full tread. Better than S02 in this regard.

Comments    Harder to balance than the others. S02's take next to no 
weight. Seems as if they have compromised towards wear versus traction. 
Not as good as the others on really slippery surfaces but I am pleased 
wit the durability. If they are priced better than SO2's I'd buy them 
again.      
        ----------------------------------------------------

On Tire Pressure:

Last track day someone came up with the info that the Pirelli C 
compounds should be run at lower pressure. Five guys tried it. They 
were told 24 and 26 versus the factory 36 all around. All were 205/255 
on 17 inch wheels.  I did one session and added 6 pounds. One more and 
added 3.  I could feel the tires rolling under.  Day two went to 35 
cold all around. Went very nicely. Three others stuck with the lower 
pressure and by Sunday afternoon had ruined their tires. Two of us were 
happy and had lots of tread and tire left. The interesting thing was 
that pyrometer reading across the tread of all four tires were very 
even at about 75 C front and rear even though the tires were 
underinflated. Temps were similar and equally even after I added 9 lbs 
of air!

Here's the question for all you gurus out there. I operate on the 
assumption that irrespective of the tire's construction the amount of 
air pressure is (within a 3 to 4 lbs) a function of the tires volume.  
A 235 front needs lower pressure than a 205 because its greater volume 
of air means more pressure as it heats up.  Pyrometer readings can 
falsely indicate that pressure is correct even though there is 10 lbs 
of air too little! This may explain the EGOD problem with R1's?

Based on the feel of the car, the factory pressures seem to be right on 
the OEM and equally sized race tires.  As things heat up I drop a few 
pounds only.  Does this mean that Porsche knows all?  Some guys running 
16 inch tires inflate them to 10 lbs MORE than the factory suggests and 
get good results. That seems to blow out my air volume theory.
Comments?
