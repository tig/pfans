My car (a 75) now has what was originally a 3.0 in it (it is now 3.2 
litres). Happy to pass on whatever I can to you, one comment is to read 
Fred Schroeder's article in Volume VII of Up-Fixin (assume you are a PCA 
member...good deal to join if you aren't already).

Basically most things bolt right on, the two major items are the 
rearranging of the wiring in the 14 pin engine connector which is not 
difficult just a bit tedious, and second is the fuel system changes.

The wiring is made far easier with the factory colour diagrams, I am happy 
to share my wiring changes (which one goes to which position in the plug) 
if you need them, just that there are minor differences over the years. Let 
me know and I will dig them out...
Only major caveat is to go to your local dealer right now and pick up a 
spare plug assembly (just the plastic parts) as it is a real pain to snap 
the little cover over top of the pin holder ... I broke 2. They will swear 
it is not available, but if they check for mid-80's 911's they will find 
that it is  a) the same plug as for your 76 and b) is in fact available 
quite cheap.

Fuel system wise, major problem for my car was fittings. I ended up 
replacing all of the fuel lines from the tank on, but that is not 
necessary. There will probably be one place where you have to make up a 
little adapter to go from old to new....if you have a good source of metric 
stuff near by, no problem, otherwise a bit of manufacture is required. 

Rest of the stuff is a piece of cake....
