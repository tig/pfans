Interstate made one that was a drop in replacement on my 83 SC.  It was 
purchased sometime in 93 so no guarantees that the size of the case 
hasn't changed in the interim.  I tried to get the model number for you 
but don't want to remove the battery from the car.  I'd give them a 
call if you need a battery.
