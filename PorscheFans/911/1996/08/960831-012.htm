HI Mitch,

1) Yes, the crank, crankcase and the rods were all the same for the turbo and
the 3.0 engines. There were actually two different cases and cranks, one with
a six bolt flywheel and one with an nine bolt flywheel. 

2) Yes you can make the 3.0 heads into Turbo heads. 

3) Send your cams to Webcam. 

4) This is the hard part. You either have to use the Turbo JUNK or come up
with your own. The hot set up is to build your system around the Carrera
intake manifold and use something like a Motec engine management system. 

5) Would be best to build your own or have your own exhaust system built. But
yes could probably get something off of an old turbo. 

If you are going to go to 3.3 specs you need a different crankshaft and rods,
parts from a 3.2 Carrera would work.

If you want to keep the CIS (JUNK) system you would also need the system from
a Turbo.
