Hi Dennis,

You actually don't need all those special tools to
do a 915 rebuild.  I once attended a Tech session run
by one of our local P-shops in which the mechanic
took apart and reassembled a 915.  Whenever a
special tool was needed, he also showed us how
the job could be done without it.  I must
confess that it is impossible for me to remember any
of the details, but I anticipate doing my T's 915 this
winter and I think I'll be able to figure out how to
get things apart and together without the special tools.

The 901 is a bit different in that you really should have
a special jig to hold things together during assembly, but
even here he showed us how an experienced person, like
himself, could hold it all in his hand without the jig.

My opinion on most of the special tools you see is that
they are nice to have, that's for sure, but not necessary
if you are willing to take a bit more time to do things, or
even to fashion a tool or jig yourself.  If you run a shop, and
time is money, then you need the tool.  But if it's a hobby,
where you are supposed to spend time (and money too, especially
if P-cars are your hobby...) then you can do without it.

There are a few folks on the list who have been into
their transmissions who I am sure could help.  I know
that I'll be taking advantage of them.  (Hear that
Tom?  Rob?)

Regards,

Bob
