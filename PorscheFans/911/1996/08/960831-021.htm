P-fans,

This event is going great - only one other P-fan has stopped by though (Rich
Lambert).

The 911 feature group has 33 SWB cars running, fastest car Friday was Walt
Maas. Today (Saturday) Walt damaged his car in qualifiying and Mark Eskuche
appeared to be the fastest car on the track (didn't see times before I left
the track).

I'm running my 912 in the 4 cyl group - fastest car in my group by far was
Milt Minter driving Al Lager's 356.  In fact, Milt's time also faster than
all of the 911s!

Also, Warren Eads and friends have some 550s in attendance and Dean Watts
brought an Abarth Carrera.

Feature races are Sunday and I will try to post any Porsche results I am
aware of before we leave for California.

Also, Allan Friedman, PCA Club Racing Director is here racing his 911 and
checking out the track facilities for a possible club race during the 1998
Parade which will be here at Steamboat.

Regards,

Phil Van Buskirk
