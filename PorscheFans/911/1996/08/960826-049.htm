Hi all:

Been gone for 10 days.  Lots of stuff here to look at.  All Bilstein front
struts with Bilstein inserts have an external bump stop at the bottom of the
shock insert on the small shaft.  This piece can be seen by removing the pin
and pulling out the insert from the strut housing.  There is no internal bump
stop on the insert.  Frequently, this rubber piece will break up and will be
in a bunch of small chunks in the bottom of the strut tube.  I've seem them
so broken up that most of the rubber is in the lubricant that is in the
grease wells in the strut housing.  This part should not be left out, because
it will allow the insert to bottom out which will damage the insert.  It can
be shortened by 25mm to allow increased shock travel on a lowered car, but
you are then at absolute minimum to prevent damage.

Mike, I read your story about your protest, and you got away with one.  The
cross section must have been of the entire front strut assembly which shows
the bump stop looking like it is internal.  The insert itself has no bump
stop. 

Greg Brown
