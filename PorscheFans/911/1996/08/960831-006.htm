Doug,
Porsche Market Letter is still a great resource...only this time you'll
need to contact Phil Vanbuskirk at <PMLetter@aol.com> and ask him this
question.  Right now Phil is at Steamboat racing his vintage 912 and he'll
probably be back home I'd say by thurs. or early friday.

Otherwise, Bruce Anderson has written a series of price guide type articles
for EXCELLENCE magazine and those are a pretty good baseline too.  Bruce
got  a little bit of criticism for high numbers (prices) in these articles,
but I honestly think that's a matter of opinion as the real price is really
what you and seller ultimately agree on...(in other words, negotiate).  The
articles do provide the baseline you're gonna need (so you don't get robbed
for $25,000 for a 2.7liter roach...)  I can't remember what month(s)
Bruces' writeups appeared...ask Bruce, or call the EXCELLENCE people and
beg for a reprint.

I hope this gets you pointed in the right direction...

Cheers
Thom Kuby
