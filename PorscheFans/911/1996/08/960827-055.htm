Hi Guys:

I been lurking on the list for a couple of weeks, great to be here. 
Been building up a head of steam to finish connecting up my homespun topend
 2.4 rebuild on my  ' 72 T --some of you might have caught my saga  last
spring
on  Pphiles. No progress to report on that front but with Bob Spindel's help
we got the engine in the before I left town.  The new
job has settled into a groove so its time to return to my "hobby car."

All this recent talk of brakes and calipers got me to fired up to take a look
at mine. (How this task jumped ahead of getting my engine fired up is beyond
me!)  Anyway, I am certain my car never has had any brake service and for
some reason I always been hesitant to work on disc brakes (drums no problem).
I have the alloy M(?)calipers and I have had the ATE rebuild kits in hand for
awhile now. So I went to work tonight on the left rear caliper first,
expecting the worse on
bore corrosion. What I discovered was that --yes there is corrosion but it is

outside of the internal seal,  is this terminal?  The inboard side of the
cylinder is relatively ok and I have scoured it with a scotch brite pad.
With only one caliper off now, I suspect I will find similar situations at
the other ends.  My questions:

1) Can one safely with fine emory cloth remove corrosion outboard of the
seal on the caliper bore?
2) Has anyone ever heard of PBR Deluxe brake pads?  Parts Heaven
sold them to me last spring and Al @Parts Heaven swears they are
the best... 8{) They are made by Aussies if that helps identify them.

3) Finally are there any MFI 911 gurus in the Denver area that someone can
recommend?  The local PCA chapter has been helpful on this front already
but personal recs are welcome.

Great to be back amongst you'll.  

Bill
ps 
The house I bought had a ' 66 blue 912 sitting in the garage, the owner was
clueless
about it, he picked it up in a real estate deal five years ago in California
and parked
it. It could  probably be picked up for song if anyone is
interested I could facilitate things.  The body was excellent.
The engine had been out once at least but was original 70k miles.  My wife
said no! I moved four German cars from Seattle (911 rode in the van) and
had to sell my fifth one before we left.
