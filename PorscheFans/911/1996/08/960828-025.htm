I've been calling the various places suggested by folks on the list where I 
could get a good rebuild on my type 915 gearbox, all were very good 
suggestions, but Jeff at JCM just may have the solution to my problem.

When I described what had happened (jumped out of second suddenly, 3rd, 4th 
 missing in action as well, no significant problems before that) he figures 
that is not a normal failure mode for a 915 synchro, bearing or other 
internal part. Turns out there is a little cover plate on the bottom of the 
tranny which holds a guide for the selector fork.....he is of the strong 
suspicion that the retaining bolts for the guide have come loose, which in 
turn causes the selector to wobble a bit, with resulting incorrect 
engagement, hence the missing gears.

Can't get to it until tomorrow PM, but sure sounds like a reasonable 
possibility...will let you all know...sure hope so.

In any event, he has my business if it is not the case...
