I just recently had a few questions regarding injectors that were 
answered in detail (two weeks ago?) here on p-fans.  There was a lot of 
interesting comments.  (Thanks all!!)  The end result was that I 
replaced all six injectors with new ones.  I have an 83SC and the 
injectors were about $30 each (new Bosch injectors from Automotion with 
the 20% discount that they offer twice yearly).  It has made a 
significant difference in the way the engine start, idles, and runs 
while cold.  I am quite pleased with the cost/benefit ratio and am glad 
I replaced rather than 'cleaned', 'blueprinted', or otherwise tinkered 
with an old engine component (97K miles).  

Since I didn't try cleaning or 'blueprinting' first, I don't know if it 
would have made a difference.  However for me, the decision was a 
no-brainer since the cost of a new part was comparable to the cost of 
cleaning, with the added benefit that I performed the labor myself.

Rather than blueprint, I will replace any bad injectors with new ones if 
I ever need to again.
