Hi Terry,
I ordered one of the systems the day I got the first catalog.  It's been
a long time since I've been so impressed with a new tool/gadget !!
I've been building/customizing/restoring cars since the middle '60s and
have tried many new things.  
I first tried the system on some small engine parts on new custom 914
4.3 liter project.  I used our kitchen toaster oven for these small
parts to test the system.  I was shocked how easy and perfect the parts
came out.  I then went out and bought a used 30" oven that is now a
permanent fixture in my shop.  I had an old set of fuchs sitting around
and polished them up and used the semi-gloss black powder and they
turned out fantastic.  Finish is slick and solvent-proof and much more
scratch resistant than any paint.
I really recommend the Eastwood system.  Remember though you must use an
ELECTRIC OVEN !!!
Also surface has to be ABSOLUTLY CLEAN AND GREASE-FREE !
Let me know if you have questions.
Dr. Mike
