John,

Not meant as a flame, but your E-mail proves my point perfectly about
biases.  The beemer ran fine on synthetics therefore they are better than
normal oils?  NO COMPARISON was done.  There is no basis for this
assumption other than personal bias.  Does it make sense to say my friends
car which has over 200k miles in 20 years of service and has never seen
synthetics, proves normal oils are better?  I believe both types provide
ample lubrication.  I have never heard of a car failing because of a
lubrication problem that was properly maintained.

On your other point, I agree that on a molecular level the synthetics are
more consistant (actually I have no clue if that is correct, but it makes
sense), but particals the size of molecules are not going to hurt my
engine.  Dust, dirt and other metal pieces will. Air/oil filters allow
giant molecules to pass through. Does anyone have any data showing that
synthetics reduce blowby in the same engine?

I am looking for direct comparisons that show synthetics are better, not
info on why synthetics are so wonderful.  If you feel better using them,
that is great and I absolutely don't believe you are hurting your engine, I
am just trying to make an informed, not emosional, decision on what to use.

Thanks

Jad
