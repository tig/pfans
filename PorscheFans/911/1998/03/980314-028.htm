Eric,

I have just done this on my '77 S coupe.  Replacement is indeed quite
easy.  I assume you are doing both front and rear velvet seals, and that
you have taken off the front wind deflectors and loosened the guide
rails on each side.

For the front seal: at the front and along the sides of the sunroof
opening, make sure the seal is flush with the roof of the car.  At the
rear of the cavity, just where the opening begins to curve, extend the
seal downward at a gentle angle about another inch. For the rear seal:
the seal should be flush with top of the sunroof panel, and should curve
around on both sides about two inches, until it is at the edge of the
panel.  Note there is also a third seal on the panel in back of the
velvet seal.  Mine was okay so I didn't replace it, but process should
be basically the same.

Adhesive is needed.  You can use either 3M (or similar) Fast Tack Trim
adhesive (red tube) or 3M Weatherstrip Seal, (white tube, black
sealant). I used the latter for weatherstripping, the former for the
headliner.  Note that before installing new seal you should remove any
old sealant using 3M Adhesive, Tar and Wax remover (Black can, liquid).

Recommendations for adhesives are from 3M (look at their web site if you
like, www.3M.com).  BTW, this procedure and many other interior
restoration tips are contained in Porter and Morgan's 'Porsche 911
Purchase and Restoration Guide', chapter 4.

Process should take about 1 1/2 hours, including removal of old seals,
stripping old adhesive, and installation of new seals.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
