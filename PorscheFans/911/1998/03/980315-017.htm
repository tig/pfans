1. How do you torque the hub nut to 300lbs do I need a new wrench?

Done at home, I would use a breaker bar and stand on it.  You can take 
you weight, multiply it by the distance along the handle you apply 
weight, and there's your torque.

2. How difficult is it to drive the hub out and what do I use?

Difficult.  I really do not like (people who) wail on the thing with 
large hammers.  I recommend thoroughly heating the arm around the 
bearing with a plumber's propane torch, then pulling or pressing the 
bearing out.

3.  Can the bearing be removed without the expense of buying a puller?

Yes, but you already know my opinion on the subject!  I use a puller if 
done on the car, a hydraulic press if done off.

4.  How do the press the bearing in without special tools.

If you chill the new bearing, and you heat the arm suitably, you can 
lose interference and the new bearing will slide right into place. 
 Work quickly, before heat has a chance to transfer to the outer race.

BTW, I always smear the outer race with anti-seize before installing. 
 Aluminum against steel guarantees a galvanic effect that will only 
make the job hard the next time, and anti-seize is very helpful at 
forestalling that.
