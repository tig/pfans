Kind of ironic that my first post to this group is a question as to whether
I should sell my '87 Carrera Coupe....Here's the deal.. and I would
appreciate anyone who has traveled this road before giving me their opinion.

I have the '87 911 and I have an excellent '86 M-B 560SL, Hdt./conv.
Both are great cars and they are both extra cars...not daily drivers. 
Question:  Do I sell both of them and buy a '95 993 or do you get enough of
the 911 experience with the '87 Carrera, plus the added plus of a
convertible in the 560SL and a totally opposite experience with it as well.
I've had lots of cars like most of you and can and will of course make up my
own mind, but it's amazing the good ideas you get when you listen. 

I have reservations even posting this as it may appear like a spoiled
whatever can't make up it's mind...but this is the issue....any opinions are
greatly appreciated.....regards
