I just recently sold an '86 and then test drove an '88. The newer car had
much taller gearing, which means it turns less RPM for any given speed/gear
combination. I really prefer the lower gearing of the '86. The sweet spot in
these engines really starts at about 3500 RPM, so when you are cruising at
3100 RPM, it is not going to jump when you punch it. If I really wanted to
accelerate hard starting from freeway cruising speeds, I would downshift to
4th or even 3rd.

So, yes, these are high revving sports cars although compared with my truck
they get do great mileage.

BTW, your '87, with its G-50 transmission, is geared like the '88 rather
than the '86. It seems the older the car, the lower the gearing.

    Eric, looking for another Carrera...
