Eric,

My '67 911 had no rear bar although it had the attachment points on the swing arm.  If the car originally came with one, there would be two mounting points on the undercarrage near the torsion bar tube.  I suspect that in the early non-S cars, no sway bar was very common.  I think the rear sway bar was a feature of the S.

I had a stock 13mm front bar and the car certainly was piggish as you say.  I'd lift the inside front tire 4~6 inches off the ground when everybody else was lifting their's 1~2 inches.  I've put on Weltmeisters on (19mm front and 16mm rear) and am still sorting out the car.  At the same time, I installed bigger torsion bars.  This makes it difficult to attribute how much of the improvement has come from the the sway gars.

How common is a '70 911T without a rear stabilizer bar?

I have one, so I know there is one out there? Is this something that
someone took off and should be replaced or was it a performance
option?

This car handles a bit piggish...

Thanks,

-Eric
