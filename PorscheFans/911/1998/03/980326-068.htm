I found the engine ID and it's just what the original paperwork
said, it's just a 2.7...

Now my question is..  What is the best way to find out if your
motor has had some of the normal 2.7 engine savers done. I see in
paperwork that the pop off valve was put on (what's that and where
is it?)

I have a neighbor that has had his SC for quite sometime now and
states that my car sounds better then most, none of the normal lil
engine rattles and that the motor sounds really tight. It feels
tight, except I have not figured the perfect way to start her when
she is really cold. I actually have to use that lil throttle
handle (between the seats) in the AM to keep the car at 1000 to
warm up as it won't sit at 500rpm for a bit after start up, but
then it sits at 500 like a rock! A rock Jerry! (tm)Kramer

Damn er darn, they replaced the oil return tubes in 79, the car
was only on the road for 4 years before they went bad.. That is
awfull. The builders must of been out late at an Oktoberfest :).

These cars seem to need a lot of valve adjustments. And the valve
cover gaskets seem to be replaced a lot (no different time then
valve adjustment)

What should compression be on this motor?

And why does the transmission need to be resealed all the time?

Thanks ,

Don't worry I ordered some books tonight!
