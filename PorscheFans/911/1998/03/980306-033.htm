<I've been wondering about this. How do I calibrate my click torque wrench?>

According to my Digitork (Sears) instruction manual:
"This should be done regularly if the wrench is used frequently or is
subjected to abnormal handling or storage. In assembly line type of usage, the
wrench should be checked every 10,000 cycles (torque applications).
Calibration service is available by returning your wrench to the nearest Sears
store." 

I'm assuming other manufacturers have their own calibration service as well
(don't bet on anyone in Taiwan doing this for you, however).

Admittedly, I've never calibrated my torque wrench, but I don't use it that
often either. For home inspection, I suppose one could fabricate a twin hex-
type jig to check your clicker against a beam type wrench. BTW, better made
signaling torque wrenches have tighter accuracy specifications. My 75 ft-lb
range model is +-3% above 15 ft-lbs. and +-1/2 ft-lb. below 15 ft-lbs. Snap-On
and equivalent models are probably more accurate, better made and are priced
accordingly. It's also a good idea to use a torque wrench whose maximum range
is close to the torque values you're going to use. In other words, a 1/2" dr.
0-150 ft-lb. torque wrench is most accurate on fasteners needing around 100
ft-lbs., not on those 4mm bolts requiring only 5-6 ft-lbs.
