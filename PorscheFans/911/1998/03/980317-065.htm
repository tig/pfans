Hi PFans:

I posted a question a few days ago seeking advice on the best polish and wax
plus rubber care for Porsches. So far the majority of responses favor
Meguires, zymol, blitz wax and mother's gold respectively. for rubber care I
recieved an OVERWHELMING response to just say NO to armorall! Almost all said
to use Black again. I also got some favorable comments about Griot's vinyl and
rubber treatment and lexol. Lastly, Brooks wrte me and also recommended Honda
Spray cleaner for motorcycles as a good in between wax job detailer. He said
it was better than Meguires. Just wanted to pass on some info. 

Here's this week's questions. Anyone out there have a copy of factory manuals
that cover 87 carreras they'd be willing to sell? I have the engine manual but
am missing the others. I can't afford the $400 for a new set(I can only dream
of trying to justify that one to my wife-I still love her) so copies are ok.

Also, there seems to be a few P-Fans camps aligning between Castrol syntec,
redline and Mobil 1. Anyone know of any engine tests proving one is better
than the other? My opinion is that they're all so good you probably couldn't
tell. 
 thanks, Ernie
