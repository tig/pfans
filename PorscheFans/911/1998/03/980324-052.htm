Mike -

What you say about changing tires & wheels makes sense, but the C4 (as
opposed to a C2) I am led to understand is VERY persnickety about having the
same rolling diameter front and rear. This seriously restricts available
tire/wheel combinations in the car. Not that it can't be done, but it will
be harder.
