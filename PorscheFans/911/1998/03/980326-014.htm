P-Fans,

PLEASE HELP WITH THIS ONE !

I am new to this list, and HAD begun enjoying it and benefitting from all
the information. When I joined, I began receiving the digest on a regular
basis but since March 18, and for some obscure reason, some of the digests
have stopped coming. Can someone please take the time to forward the missing
digests for me, since the archives also seem incomplete.

My attempts at contacting the LISTMASTER have failed (Jim, if you are
reading this, kindly look into the problem, as other members have had the
same thing happen to them.)

The ones I need are for March 18, 22, 23, 24 and 25.
