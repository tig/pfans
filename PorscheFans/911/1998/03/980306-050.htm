Michael Tiernay corrected my earlier post on using Armoral for the rear
deck and any plastic parts. Per Michael's instructions I'll be changing
to a silicon free product, at least for the interior stuff. I hope I
didn't screw anything up for anyone.

Thanks Michael for the information,

Mike Wyatt

 Mike; I was told by my Porsche dealer to avoid using Armoral AT ALL
COSTS
 !!!. It is water /silicon based and after you have used it,  you cannot
ever
 get your leather re-dyed or your plastic re-dyed. There is a lot of
good
 products on the market that aren't silicon based

 Good Luck


Elia,

    I've got a 97 C2 that I just got lowered with H&R springs, rear
3.8GT wing, RS splitters and some new looking front air ducts with
integral fog lamps (the car looks and handles great, got some JPEG's if
anyone is interested). Anyway, I just use a rag with warm soapy water
for the rear window interior deck. Then apply Armoral or another similar

product to help keep the deck from cracking from the UV from sunlight.
If it's the rear plastic deck on the movable wing just use standard car
wash followed with Armoral for the same reason. I've had no problems
with this.

Enjoy your new friend,

Mike Wyatt
