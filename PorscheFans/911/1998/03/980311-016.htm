>Earlier today ,I happened to be on the phone with Parish Ins.,of Nashville,
>Tenn.  They are the producers of the On Track Coverage for auto insurance
>available through Chase and Heckman.  For those of you who do not know C&H
>they are insurance agents who's policy covers your car during DE events.
>They offer such things as 5000mi./yr. allowance and $5000 ded.if damage
>occurs on-track.  They do not cover actual timed racing events( PCA Club
>Racing or autocrosses).  I was informed that this year will be the last for
>OTC coverage.(Seems they had a few too many claims).  If anyone out there
in
>the insurance industry can give some of us DE junkies some direction I'm
>sure the entire group would be grateful.
>Concerned about next year,
