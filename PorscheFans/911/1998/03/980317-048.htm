I thank in advance anyone who can shed some light on the following two
electrical problems that I have troubleshot to the best of my ability...

1)Oil Level gauge doesnt:

The oil level gauge stays at the bottom despite a full tank. I have gotten
nowhere on this one. How can I troubleshoot this without purchasing a
new float/sender? I did find the two wires at the sender. A green and a
brown. The brown (ground right?) I tried to follow. I think it grounds to
the body in the engine box. Using a test light I was never able to find a
circuit to make the light go on either between the two wires, or the two
terminals on the tank unit? How do I troubleshoot this? Is it probably the
sender?

2)Stealth horns:

Horns do not honk. When I depress the horn button on the steering
wheel I do hear an audible click from the relay but no horn. I tried
replacing the horn relay with the relay for the fog lights (same part #)
and it does the same thing. The kicker is I do not have fog lights installed
so do I have two bad relays? Next I tried the same relay from the Rear
Windows defroster. Same problem. Again, I live in S. CA and am not sure
the defroster really works...;(

 I pulled the two wires from the left horn and connected my test light. I
depressed the horn - no light. I then ran a hot wire directly from the
battery to the green (?) lead of the left horn and I did hear noise -
although strange. I think it has aftermarket horns that "buzz" more than
honk. So, did I prove the horns are OK and the problem is a bad relay?

Help...

Thanks,
