Pfans,

I have a sound coming from the rear of my car that makes me think my
shockies have gone. It doesn't seem related to engine revs so I don't think
it is engine related, rather, suspension related.

It sounds like some travel is occuring (in the shocky?) and as a result a
knocking sound is heard particularly over uneven road but it does continue
over smoother surfaces.

Pressing down on the rear wings results in more travel than I would have
expected along with a squeeking noise on the way down and a bump at the top
of the travel up. I'm thinking the bump I'm hearing here is the knock I
hear when driving the car.

I bought the car 6 weeks ago and prior to that it had not travelled many
K's in the last 18 months.

Before I take it to a shop I wouldn't mind hearing some suggestions on what
the problem could be.

(Sorry for the non technical description).

Thanks
Ron
