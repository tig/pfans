It is a tight press fit, but it is not all that tough. I'd make a "U" out of
3/4 plywood or similar which fits snugly around the shift lever and just
whack it from below a few times. NOt that it is all that hard to take out
the shift housing (about 5 bolts at the base of it), but is almost always
isn't necessary. I would not worry too much about a stock Porsche shift
lever, from what I recall of mine it is about 3/8" diameter and probably
could take whatever you could dish out short of a sledge hammer..

If you really do not care about the old knob, then why not take a saw and
just cut is from the side until you get to the sleeve and then take a
screwdriver and split it apart? Also recall that it is twistable with a
decent pipe wrench on it.

Hope this helps.
