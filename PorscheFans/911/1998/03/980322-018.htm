Hi,

After subscribing to this list for a while, I'm constantly impressed by
the wealth of knowledge here and this great forum to allow for the
sharing of it.  I have to warn you that I'm pretty much a neophyte, so I
hope these questions don't sound too stupid, but here goes...

I purchased a 2.7L a while ago with 90K.  It's a beautiful widebody
slantnose, non-turbo, and the color is bright shade of blue that's
really hard to describe in words.  It does have a paint number of
304-9-3.  Does someone know what the official color name of this is or
how I can go about finding this out?

At the time I bought it, I did do some of my homework, but not all of
it.  What I know up to this point is that to mitigate the design flaws
of the 2.7, I should:

..   Have the case helicoiled or timeserted.
..   Use Raceware studs.
..   Replace the 5-blade fan with an 11-blade fan
..  Add an extra oil cooler
..  Carrera Tensioners

What is a case?  What does helicoiled mean?  I have receipts from the PO
that say timeserts have been installed, but is there a way I can tell if
this have been done?

I have receipts from the PO that say a rebuild was done about 11K ago
with Dilivar studs, and I now hear that these are no longer the
preferred choice.  Should I be concerned?  If so, how long do you think
I can go with the Dilivar studs?

After opening the trunk and looking at the engine, I did see an 11-blade
fan facing me.  Is the right one?

How can I tell an extra oil cooler has been added?  Where do I look?

How can I tell if Carrera tensioners are there?  Where do I look?

Thanks for your patience with this beginner,
Norm.
