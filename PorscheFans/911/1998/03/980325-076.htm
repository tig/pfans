Hi PFans,

I'm having an odd problem with my gauge lights.  Basically, the oil/fuel
level, speedo, and clock have no illumination.  I had this problem
before I started with the interior work, and had hoped that replacement
of bulbs was the solution.  All gauges have been pulled out of the dash
(yep, just pull out on a '77) but not disconnected for removal of
dashboard and placed back in.  All bulbs were replaced with new ones
from Automotion - 12V/2W for bayonet style, 12V/1.2W for press-in
glass.  No corrosion in bulb sockets and wiring connections look both
corrosion-free and tight.   No obvious fraying in wires.

Headlights and fog lights work, and the potentiometer in the main light
switch dims the oil pressure/temperature and tach gauges (which work
fine), along with the hazard light and heater control lights.  All fuses
appear to be intact.  Not all connections have been finished (e.g., seat
belt warning hookup to new seats, rear speakers, heater lever light near
handbrake), but nothing that would obviously affect gauges.

Is there some relay or other switch that differentially controls only
the problem gauges noted?  It seems odd to me that only some rather than
all gauges would be affected by a short or other electrical gremlin.
Any thoughts on the nature of the
problem and/or methods for troubleshooting would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

Robert Herbert
