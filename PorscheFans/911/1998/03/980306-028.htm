I did the same upgrade on my 964 C4, I'd suggest that if you have the
menas... go for an 18" setup... thats the only thing I regret...  there are
some new versions of the Twin Turbo rim in that size for 200-300 bucks a
wheel... I lowered mine with an H&R kit and new koni's... I went 205x50 17
fronts and 225x40 17 on rear, looks like she could use a bit more rim,
though, still plenty of room in the wells, even with the wider wheels, 9",
9.5".... I have no probs with abs/traction contral on C4, which is kinda
sensative on the AWD  system..  SP8000's are RAD.. far better then the
P-Zeros that I run now...
