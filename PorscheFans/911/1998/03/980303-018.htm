I would be interested to hear from anyone who has done extensive dyno 
testing on the 1972 / 73 RS2.7 Carreras.

Factory listed as 210hp 
    :
    .
then: 
One car, reported to be fully legal and with an engine  not touched this 
season has just returned a figure of 238 hp.

========================================================
The RS was rated at 210 DIN hp which tends to be from 7 to 10% less than the
SAE value. Figure 225 to 231 SAE hp. Also be aware that the ratings for Porsche
engines tend to be conservative so for specials like the RS it wouldn't be unusual 
for some to be significantly over the advertised value.

At 225 SAE with the 5% margin you are allowed the car could go to 236+ hp,
if you use the high value of 231 you can go close to 243 SAE hp. 

The net value could change based on options like AC. Also the temp and barometric
pressure/altitude could have an impact of a few percent. 

The best book on the RS Carrera is Grubner and Konradshim (sp?) but it is
very hard to find (and expensive, figure from $150 to $300 US)
