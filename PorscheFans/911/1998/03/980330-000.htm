Dear P-Fans

Like Brian Buxton I was horrified to read about the abuse which Leonard
M. (wicked 9's ) suffered following a genuine mistake in posting to all
lists. I subscribe to the 914 & the 911 list (current ride is a 914,
planning to return to a 911 in the next few mths.) from the UK and I am
constantly surprised at the good nature of the other subscribers with
their contributions and advice. I find it really difficult to reconcile
this with the thought that some other subscribers are sick enough to
threaten someone or abuse them for a mistake which albeit inconvenient
is not after all the end of the world......... 

It makes me seriously question whether I want to be associated with such
people however indirectly. On behalf of all subscribers I would like to
offer Leonard a sincere apology. Fortunately, I believe there are enough
decent folk in the world of Porsches to make it worth sticking with my
hobby. Also I never did believe in giving in to bullies........... 

So let's do something about it, is it possible for the listmaster to
"name & shame" these people? I am no techie expert but if Leonard
supplied the mails could they be identified and excluded or at least
let's see who we're dealing with? Or perhaps they will suddenly get the
courage to come forward and justify their outpourings? No I doubt it
too.

I really don't need this on a dull grey English Monday morning!

Phil.
