Thanks to all who replied to my request for advice on torque wrenches.  I
was at Autothority the other day having some work performed and asked the
mechanic (Scott - a VERY nice guy and a perfectionist in his work) what he
would recommend.  He said Snap-On.  I said I really didn't want to spend
that much money just so I could torque my lug nuts for track events, etc.
He said that a Craftsman torque wrench would work just fine.

So, given that at least 75% of the replies I received suggested Craftsman,
and considering the advice from Scott.....I'm buying a Craftsman.  I'll let
you know if I have any problems with it.

Kevin
