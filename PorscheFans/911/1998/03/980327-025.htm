You are wise to get these used; I checked with a Porsche dealer for
these and told the complete rear window lock assembly, in black, runs
about $200 per side!  However, there are several pieces to these, so it
may help to determine exactly what part you need.

Check with John at Original Fit Interiors (541.679.4460).  I talked with
him this morning about some parts he is sending me, so I asked him if he
would sell just this piece.  He said it was not a problem, and
recommended you send him a sample of your carpet so he can match color
and style.  All the materials (including carpet) I have gotten from them
has been excellent, and their prices are among the best I've found.

Hope this helps, and enjoy 'Dadda porch'.
