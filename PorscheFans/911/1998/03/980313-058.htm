Maybe I'm a bit naive, but before participating in my first DE event
(coming up in two days!!!!), I called my insurance agent (State Farm - I
live in Northern Virginia) and asked about coverage for DE events.  He
questioned why PCA would want to teach me how to drive at 100+ MPH (I was
VERY honest with this guy) but checked my policy and said that as long as
it was NOT a race (i.e. not a timed event) there was no exclusion in my
policy and so I was covered.  I asked the question several different ways
to make sure, but he said there is no exclusion in my Virginia policy and
so I would be covered.  I'm not even gonna LOOK at my watch during DE
events.  I'm personally not going out there to see how fast I can drive.
I'm going out there to learn more about how my 993 handles and to HAVE FUN!

Now, I have a stupid question about all the threads on Euro vs US ride
heights on 993's.  OK, let's assume (correctly, I believe) that the Euro
993's are set up to ride lower.  If that's the case, why can't you just
order the EXACT shocks and springs from Porsche as they use in Europe?  At
the very least, if they won't sell the items to US customers for fear of
being sued by someone, surely you could get a buddy in Europe to order them
for you and send them over.  I can't understand all the "after market"
questions about this.  Why can't you just get the same set up via Porsche.
Am I missing something here?  Is there something they do to the Euro cars
vs US cars other than different shocks and springs?  Just curious.

By the way, my father-in-law is trying to sell his Euro 1966 Mercedes 230
SL.  Does anyone know if there is a digest for MB fans??
