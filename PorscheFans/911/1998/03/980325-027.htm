Terry,

Yes, there are different mounting points (at least on my car).  I had a
"small" battery in my 911.  When it died and they brought the replacement
to the counter for me to buy it, I said "no way will that fit in my car!" 
They insisted it was the correct model.  So after making sure that I could
bring it back, I purchased it.  Sure enough, there was another threaded
hole for the mounting bracket bolt further out from the one that was
previously used.  The battery did, in fact, fit.

BTW, the larger size is a VERY tight fit.  Not much room for hands in
there.  Also VERY heavy.  I really appreciated the built in handle on the
battery I bought.  If you are getting a replacement, I would suggest a
model with the handle.
