Hi,

>> As to the interesting note regarding K and N on earth moving 
machinery, I suspect that K and N never designed their filters to 
operate in such an environment. The manufacturer of the machinery 
knew where that particular engine was going to work and provided 
exceptional paper filters as a matter of due precatuion. I don't 
fault K and N for anything on that account. <<

I was off the net for a while, but I remember a year or 2 ago
it was clamied that that post about the earth moving machinery
was a COMPLETE HOAX. Nobody could actually find the
guy who wrote it or the real data. Supposedly spread by
a disgruntled customer or competitor or ???. Did I miss
the proof or it is still agreed that it was a hoax?
