I'll add another opinion to this nicely technical discussion of the 915, for
what it is worth.

My recollection of the tranny output shaft seals on the 915 is that I put
them on from the outside of the transmission case after it was buttoned
up but before I put the drive flanges back in and bolted them on.  Seems
to me a seal puller or screw driver ought to do the trick of prying old
ones out without need to resort to taking anything else apart.  But I'd
happily stand corrected, as I have not had to do this but once, and then
just for good measure as part of a complete rebuild.

What I really recall was wondering how deep to set these seals.  Too
shallow and they will rub on the output CV flange.  It looked like if you
just pushed them in as far as they would go (normal seal mounting
techinique on the engine or front wheel hub, for instance, where a lip or
non-moving part limits depth) they could rub on the end of the rotating
part of the differential that the drive flanges slip into.  I must have gotten it
right (no leaks even years later) but I have always wondered.  Shop
manual sayeth naught on this score. Anyone figured this out?

I don't know about the ZF factory limited slip, but installing a Quaife
shouldn't require setting pinion depth.  You are not doing anything which
would relocate the ring gear axis, and are using the same ring gear of
course.  However, you do have to go through the tedious process of
setting the backlash, because you will have disturbed the side to side
relationship of the two gears, since I think no two ring gear carriers are
ever exactly the same dimensionally, and the Quaife which replaces
these parts certainly isn't precisely the same.  This is tough enough for
us shade tree mechanics not only because you need a special sort of
puller (or just a press, which gets old in a hurry) to use each time you
swap the spacer shim washers around trying to get the right numbers
on your dial indicator, but also because you really need a stock of
various thickness washers.  It is not like adjusting the alternator pulley or
chain parallelism where one size is all there is.

A mechanic buddy once claimed he could set pinion depth with a series
of careful measurements using relatively ordinary precision measuring
tools.  Didn't tell me how, though.  Others have said you can actually do it
just with bluing, which all the pros recommend using anyway to check
your work.
