Hi P-Fans:
Many have written regarding high wattage headlight bulbs.  I do not know =
if
a headlight =

housing can be melted, but can share my research.  My '90 C4 (964) uses a=

Porsche =

spec. Sylvania #9004 45W/65W bulb.  My lenses are covered with the 60mil.=

stone =

guard material.  I asked my local State Patrol what the legal maximum
wattages were =

and they said they enforced the national codes--of course, not providing =
me
with the =

information I wanted.  You know, "I can't tell you what the law is, but y=
ou
better not =

break it!"  I went to the library and read the federal code.  My
RECOLLECTION is that =

you can run 50W/65W (low and high beam ratings).  This is my
recollection--thinking to =

myself that the off-the-shelf factory bulb is about all you can use
LEGALLY.  If you =

chose to run a higher wattage bulb, you will draw even more attention fro=
m
the law than =

you already do!  Secondly, the stone guard material will yellow and
possibly melt.  =

Thirdly, the heat buildup in the lens may cause the lens to break or your=

housing to =

melt.  I used to run 100W bulbs in my below the bumper fog lamps on my la=
st
car, =

rather than the stock 55W bulbs.  Those lenses cracked all the time.  I
speculate they =

cracked when water splashed them or I ran through deep snow.  I decided t=
o
leave well =

enough alone.  Good luck to you all!
