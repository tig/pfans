catalogs sell and put them on when you install your new unit.  (The
couplings have both male & female threads so you attach them to the
thermostat & then attach the
hoses to the couplings.)  Then if you ever need to disconnect the
thermostat you can disconnect it at the coupling and won't ruin the threads
on the thermostat."

==========================================================================
        There are two types of fittings that would work here.  The first are
"unions" ...I use these all the time in my shop compressor installations
where all the air lines are threaded pipe (galvanized & 316ss).  I would
avoid brass unions with the Porsche's oil thermostat as brass is very soft
and can easily be chewed up and rounded with an ill fitting open end wrench.
The other are "hydraulic couplings"  which is the hydraulic equivalent to
pneumatic quick disconnect.  I use these for my shops hydraulic lines
between the hydraulic pumps & rams or pullers. I like the threaded "high
flow" type available through Enerpac (and others) and would recommend some
medium threadlock if use for the Porsche lubrication system (this is not a
static environment...there's plenty of vibration here).  
        John...what type have you seen used here and what is the thread size
(diameter/pitch) required to connect to the thermostat?  SD
