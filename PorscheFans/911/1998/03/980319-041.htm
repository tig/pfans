I think (all books at home, not at computer) the torque for valve cover
nuts is 8 pounds/feet.  A lot lower than you might think, anyway.  I
confess I do it by feel.   This compares with torque for the 8mm case
studs of 18 lbs/feet. 

The low torque means that you haven't stretched the stud appreciably,
so it is mainly the nylock friction which keeps the nut from vibrating off. 
However, it also means you haven't squished the gasket too much (or
worse, the aluminum washers.  Some cheap washers will squish so
much if you are heavy on the torque you have to pry them off one by
one with a screwdriver, which means you spend more time just getting
the #@$%& covers off than you do on adjusting valves or otherwise
snooping around under the valve covers as planned).  And more
importantly, it means you are less likely to warp the valve covers.  The
crack you found in a corner of one of your exhaust valve covers may
have happened because someone tried to stop an oil leak from that point
by tightening the nut and tightening some more until it didn't leak quite as
much.  Most of us have been there before we got religion, and even
backslide on occasion.
