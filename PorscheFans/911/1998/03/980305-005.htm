Reply to Kazbah, in regards to the 911 cab in Houston.  Sorry to pull you back
down to earth, but I would take a pass on that one. Be very cautious of ANY
car that was completely repainted unless the paint job is of excellent
quality.  Let me elaborate a little ( it's early morning and I'm waiting for
paint to dry on my Jeep) cause I have some time to waste!!!!
The right car for your budget is out there you just have to find it.  I was
looking for over a year for mine. Found a listing for a '83 930 with, get
this, 2400 miles, damn right I bought it!!!!!!!!!!! The car is IMMACULATE, and
it fit my budget.  I think the best place to find one is in Hemmings Motor
News. You can subsribe for $27.00 a year, and a new issue is on your doorstep
every month.  It also has listings for auto appraisers who will look at a car
and give expert analysis. Online at www.hemmings.com. 
As far as the paint goes, I have been in the custom car field for 20 years,
and have seen alot of good paint jobs. If you can tell at a glance that it's
been repainted, take a pass.  A cheap paint jobs is a sure sign of poor
maintanance also. 
Be patient, you'll find one.......I did!

 Just my opinion, for what it's worth. : )
