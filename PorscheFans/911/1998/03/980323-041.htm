Bob- (and to others that have offered support)

Thank you for your response to my recent posting on PFans.  I have made
repeated efforts to look for this mystery box and until now have not had any
luck.  On Saturday I once again pulled the speedo and sure enough the little
box was there.  It sits low, behind the speedo and has a few feeds (at least
one of which comes from the back of the speedo).  The box is black and in the
right hand corner there is a white botton (about 8mm in diameter) that I
pushed in.  Once pushed the 02 light went out and I presume that my clicking
speedo problem is also solved (I have not been able to confirm since the
weather has not been cooperative for me to test drive).

Thanks again Bob.
