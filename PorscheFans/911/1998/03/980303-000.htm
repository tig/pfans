Hi,
I'd really like to see a copy of the letter that Porsche Cars NA sent to
the Brown Trout calendar publisher. I can understand with and support
PCNA in pursuing unauthorised use of their crest but not use of pictures
of their cars owned by someone else and taken with the owner's consent.

If I agree to let a calendar publisher take a picture of my Porsche and
use it in their calendar then Porsche Cars NA can have nothing
whatsoever to say about the use of that picture. They could complain
that Brown Trout is implying approval of the calendar by PCNA which
would be wrong. The usual statement denying such approval and respect
for trademarks gets over that.

They may well have trademarked the dcesign of their cars but tgis is to
prevent other manufacturers making Porsche look-a-likes. No way, surely,
can PCNA decide what pictures of their cars are published where? The
idea that PCNA will write to the Wall St Journal and NY TImes to
complain of unlicensed Porsche pictures is too ludicrous to contemplate.

Were all the pictures in Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance guide licensed
by PCNA? Even the pictures ownerd by other people? Surely not.

Is it possible to have the PCNA letter to Brown Trout reproduced here
please?

All the best .... Chris
