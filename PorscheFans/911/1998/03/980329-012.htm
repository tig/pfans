I'm suddenly having a problem starting up my '89 911 Coupe.  I've had it
about 6 weeks now, and I noticed just the other day that it took a few
seconds to start the engine up cold.  Up until now, it has always started
right up.  I then tried to start the car up hot after it was sitting for
only about ten minutes, and it wouldn't start.  According to the manual,
you should not depress the gas pedal when starting a cold or warm engine,
and depress it to the floor when starting a hot engine.  After about 45
minutes of failed attempts, it finally started up.

When I got home, I waited about 10 minutes and tried it again... it
started up no problem.  This morning I tried to start it up cold and it
just cranked away, finally starting on the fifth try.  

Any ideas?  I had an alarm installed last week, after which this problem
has occurred, but I don't know how it could have caused it.

Thanks.
