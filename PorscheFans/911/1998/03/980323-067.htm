I purchased one of those oil temperature gauges with nice visible
numbers, along with the oil temperature sender the retailer said was the
proper one for the gauge, and installed same.  However, when the
ignition was turned on the gauge rose in a nice deliberate and damped
way to full scale (300 degrees F).  This didn't seem right.  I checked the
sender line, and it had continuity from end to end and wasn't shorted to
ground.  The gauge did this whether the sender was attached (I forget,
maybe a few K ohms at room temperature) or was grounded (0
resistance) or was disconnected (infinite resistance). 

It only quit this foolishness if I lifted either the positive or the ground. 
When I lifted the ground it looked like it was going to behave as a good
gauge should, rising a little bit when ignition was switched on.  However,
it never budged during the short time I allowed myself to disturb my
neighbors with the car running without muffler, even though that was
long enough to get some heat into the oil (race car, has no oil cooler on
the engine, heats up quickly, definately not the setup for stop and go
commutes).

These VDO gauges have 3 terminals.  One is marked with a +, one with
a - or sometimes "gnd" or the like, and one with some other symbol
indicating that is the sensor input.  I think this setup has been the same
for many years.  My ground is good, my + is good, and the sensor seems
to have all the right numbers stamped on it to go with the guage.  I think
these function like ammeters, with the dial indicating the (very small)
current which flows through the sensor, whose resistance varies with
temperature over a range matched to the meter's characteristics (or vice
versa).

What might I have done wrong to cause this behavior?

and in the dry sump tank to see how well the big front cooler is doing)
