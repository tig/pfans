Cris-

Hate to be the bearer of not great news but it infect does sound like a
tensioner failed.  If it is not the tensioner then it is something else
equally serious.  Loud metalic sounds seem to never be minor and are very
serious conditions.

One test my wrench performed was to open up the oil feed nuts to the
tensioner and verify that there is oil pressure going to the tensioner.  If
there is, not good news

These tensioners are very durable but they will fail.  Mine failed 50 miles
after installation.  Wrench said he had only seen 2 fail and of course mine
now holds the record for shortest life span on earth.  Replaced with
another new and have not had a lick of problems.

DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR. If the tensioner has failed the chain could slip off
and cause multiple thousands of dollars of damage.
