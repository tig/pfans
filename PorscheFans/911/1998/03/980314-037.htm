I never saw this posted, so I'll try again.  Of course, in the mean time,   
Winter has decided to show up after all...

Subject:  '86 911 - Where is the oil leak?

With Spring approaching here in the northeast (since January), I finally   
got to working on the car today.  Spent the better part of 4 hours   
pulling the cat' out (why did the factory randomly use 12mm AND 1/2"   
bolts on this?), to provide easy access to the left side valves.  But   
that's not my question...

Some of you might recall when I parked the car on my lift in the Fall, I   
discovered I had a minor oil leak coming from the rear right side of the   
motor, from somewhere up top (as evidenced by the trail of oil across the   
back <right side only> of the motor, which ultimately dripped from the   
center of the case).  The popular culprit was the oil pressure sender, if   
I'm remembering correctly (answers are saved somewhere on my home PC).   
 What I find interesting is that the motor is still leaking about a drop   
a day, despite the fact that it hasn't been run since November.  Hence,   
my question... Does it make sense that the oil leak could be from the   
sender?  Is the sender submerged in oil at rest?

Any and all guesses are encouraged.

Thanks,

Brad
