<<Don't need a dyno at all, just a lonely stretch of back road and a good 
stopwatch
   -  Drive car in third at about 2000 RPM
   -  Floor accelerator at chosen landmark
   -  Start stopwatch when tach hits 3000 RPM
   -  Stop stopwatch when tach hits 6000 RPM
   -  Return to start, repeat 2-3 more times to eliminate errors<<

Ray, this is a simple but effective test. 

I also can say though, that the driveability around town was vastly improved.
This improvement alone was worth the price of the chip. The change was several
magnitudes greater that getting a full 15K mile tuneup.

When I was test driving 911s when searching for a replacement for my totalled
'86,  I noted that the '87s and '88s that I drove were rather lethargic
feeling, even though the horsepower specs say that they have more than the
earlier Carreras. The one '86 I drove felt hotter, like my late car. 

The '85 that I would up buying was more like the '87s, probably due to the
poorly done clone chip in it - someone put one over on the previous owner - he
thought it was a "racing chip".

BTW, European Car did a DIY article on a Weltmeister Carrera chip replacement
a couple of years ago and the author used a G-analyst to verify improved
performance. Can't find the article, unfortunately. It would help someone who
wanted to change the chip themself - maybe some has the issue number.
