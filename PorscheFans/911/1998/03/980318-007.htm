<C2424@aol.com> asked :

>>
I currently have a 1980 Weissach 911 with 80,000 miles in San Jose.  Cal car,
great condition.  I have been transferred to Boston and need to sell the car.
I have seen similar cars listed between 20 and 24K depending on miles.   Does
anyone have an opinion as to where the care will bring more, California or
Boston?
 <<

I'd say NOT California. I can't beleive the low prices on clean cars
there. The guy who has been selling the 2.8 RS clone for $13K and
totally rebuilt 2.4S for $19K would have a line of people
after them in CT.

Up here in CT anything that's not rusted out sells for a lot.
Boston should be a very good marketplace right now for your car
with the stock market up and high tech guys with plenty of cash.
