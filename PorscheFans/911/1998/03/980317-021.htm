Hoping the list can share its wisdom...

Some of the recent talk about O2 sensors and resetting the dash light and
all reminded me of a question I have regarding my 83 SC:

Is this dash light supposed to come on as a check light when you turn on the
ignition?

Mine has never come on for anything.  I have owned the car from 82K to
present 91K.
I somehow remember this light being a friendly reminder to change the sensor
on other cars (VWs) and have seen it on at 30,000 mile intervals.  Same
"counter" type mechanism on the 911?

Is this normal?  If not, where should I start? Bulb, reset switch box behind
speedo, etc.

BTW, I think the O2 sensor is fine as I watched my mechanic illustrate its
purpose by disconnecting it/reconnecting while we watched the mixture change
on the Bosch diagnostic center.  (This probably is unrelated to the light
not working)

Any help or explanation is greatly appreciated.

P.S.   My speedo makes a clicking noise as a recent post describes.  A
quick/simple fix would be great.
