Don:

_I_ can find 101-octane unleaded in 55-gallon drums at Combustion 
Dynamics in El Cajon (619 588-1200) or I can get it by just pulling 
up to the pump at Ram 99, at the corner of Navajo and Jackson in San 
Diego.  Cost is about $4 per gallon.

If you don't live here in San Diego, you can find the name of a local 
distributor by calling Trick Racing Gas at 800 444-1449.

If Trick gas isn't sold in your area, you might want to look for
CAM2... It's made by (I think) Sunoco, and it comes in a few octane
grades, at least one of which may be unleaded.
