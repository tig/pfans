 wonder how many Porsche owners realize that the boxer engine
is essentially an aircraft engine design, with limited
automotive uses. I also wonder sometimes why we do not
install some of the neat (and off the shelf) engine trend
monitoring equipment available for 4/6 cylinder aircraft
engines on our Porsche engines. Cylinder head temperature,
exhaust gas temperature, and cylinder cooling trend indication.
Seems like mixture setting, etc., would be -far- easier it
we could monitor the engine -while being driven-, and these
units are off the shelf and available. 

================================================

I have seen some racing setups with the kind of minitoring you are talking about.

At the Champlain (sp?) Fighter Museum in Tempe Az they have a WW I vintage
airplane engine designed by old Dr. Porsche for an Austrian biplane. It looks 
amazingly modern compared with the radials of the period. I have also seen that
the Porsche 6 and the VW 4 are regularly used as airplane engines. As I 
understand it most automobile engines can't survive the stress on the crankshaft 
or the duty cycle of running close to 100% all the time. 

 
On another topic - Has anyone used the aftermarket carpet replacement kits? What
is the difference in quality between the German and American made? Is it noticable?
How difficult are the kits to install?

thanks
