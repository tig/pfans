Hi All,

 Ive been on this list for a while now and Im not sure if Ive seen this
information or not, so I figure ill just ask.... Im looking for a glass RS
front spoiler, rear bumper and a duck tail for an RS replica Im building from
my 72T, ..My question is, who or where would be the best place to get these
parts from ? Ive got a GT Racing catalog and I hear good things about his
parts ,but they are just a bit pricey when compared to others,but Im not sure
if this is one of those things where you really do get what you pay for ...ive
never seen this type part in person...Im not so much worried about SUPER high
quality and fit, only because I run an aircraft composites manufacturing shop
by day, so reworking the part to fit perfectly is no big deal.

An alternative would be someone out there has the parts used and would be
willing to sell ....anyone?????  If someone does, please email me direct

More than enough for now...
 Thank You.
