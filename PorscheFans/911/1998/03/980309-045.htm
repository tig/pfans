Sorry, I'm a bit thick, and cautious....

I have those polished fuchs, 6&7 with 205s all around (yes, 205 front
and rear !!!).
I now understand I can leave the 205s in front and put 225 rears on
those wheels without a problem, thanks to the list.

But I also don't like the polished center look, I think it makes my 83
look like a 74, so I am considering swapping for a set of black center
wheels (polished around though, like all other SCs I see every day), and
if i do, I might as well get 7 and 8s then...

So, what's more feasible / less costly etc ? Were polished wheels an
option on SCs or did I inherit replacement wheels ? 

- Should I just repaint the polished centers and mount new tires in the
back ? I'd be happy with black 6 and 7s, it's just that if I have to
swap, I might as well get the bigger wheels ! So painting my wheels
black is the easiest I think, but is it a crime ? Are polished fuchs
considered more expensive, rare or valuable than black center fuchs ?
Would someone be willing to swap with me ? 

- In case I go with 7 and 8s, will they require other adjustments on an
83 SC than just a bolt on ? (redo alignment or god knows what else?)


Many thanks in advance, you guys have been very helpful.

driven... ;-)
