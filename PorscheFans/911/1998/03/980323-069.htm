Agreed, especially the 9".

Gunther,

The 7 & 9 x 16 wheels should work on the '73 with flares.  On my '77
WideBody, I use Fuchs 8 & 9 x 16 wheels, with 205/55 front and 245/45
rear Pirellis.  Rear wheels have 2 inch spacers (50mm).  This setup
fills the wells quite nicely, with little fender gap.  If either of your
wheels would be set in, I would think it would be the front, not the
rear.  I don't think there is so great an offset difference between
standard 5-spoke Fuchs and newer Cup style wheels as to cause problems,
but that would be one thing to check.  I think that 7 (or 8) & 9 x 16 is
a pretty standard size for Turbo and Turbo-look cars.  A knowledgeable
wheel vendor should be able to help you with fitment.  You might want to
see if Steve Timmins can help you; he is a distributor for some wheel
manufacturers (Forgeline?) and specializes in suspension setups,
including wheels.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
