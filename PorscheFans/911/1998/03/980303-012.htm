A little over a year ago, I was looking for a 911.  I could have purchased
a 964, the price difference was not an issue for me at that time.  I decided
that I prefered the torsion bar suspension and the looks of the 84-89 911 to
the coil springs and different body of the 964.

The air conditioning is a joke. The ventilation is perfect--just drop the top!

I do not regret my choice...even though I have replaced the rubber-centered
clutch with a turbo clutch (that's expensive!). 

I prefer the more challenging handling and the more taught suspension, but
then
again I bought the car knowing I was going to autocross and perhaps someday
race
the car. I also figured that as one of the last few of the original
suspension 911s
the car would have a good chance of appreciating some day.  Relatively few
were
imported I think, or perhaps their owners just don't get rid of them,
because it 
wasn't easy to find one for sale at that time.

Subject: Carrera vs. C2

I am responding to Ken Ross/Bill Schnellman question.  Did anyone else
notice Bruce Anderson's recent article in Excellence about current late
model 911 values?  He speculates that the 3.2 Carrera and 993 will be
more desirable and hold their values better in the long term than the
C2/C4.  Both my mechanics like the 3.2 Carrera better than C2/C4.  I
must say I prefer the 84-89's styling.  What does anyone else think?
