Hi P-Fans,

I have a question for the collective wisdom of the group.  What are your
opinions on the best tire size combination for the track (driver's ed).
The limiting factor is that I want to stay with my stock 16 x 6 & 16 x 7
Fuchs.  The car is a 1986 911 Carrera (narrow body).

I currently have 225/50/R16 on the fronts and 245/45/R16 (D40M2's) on
the rears.  I recently measured the distance from the outside of the
front tire to the inner lip of the fender and discovered that the
outside of the tire is outboard of the fender lip by about 1/4".  I
haven't experienced any front tire rub in the 2000 miles or so that I
have had this combination, but then again, I haven't driven it very
aggressively either.  Common sense tells me that when I go out on the
track, the front tire will rub the fender during aggressive maneuvers.
Will this be the case?  The car has not been lowered.

Should I switch the fronts back to the stock 205/55/R16 size?  Or will
the 225's not rub the fender?  What about the rears?  Any
advantage/disadvantage to the larger than stock size?  With the reduced
prices for SP8000's at the Tire Rack (thanks for that tip by the way), I
am thinking of going back to the stock tire sizes.

Your opinions greatly appreciated.
