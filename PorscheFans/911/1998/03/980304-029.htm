Hi fellow PorscheFans.

I've long been a subscriber to the 928 list (I own a 78 Euro), but am
considering purchasing an 83 911 Cabriolet. The only information I have
about it so far is as follows:

$28,900 CND.
Fully Loaded with air conditioning, power windows, power door locks,
AM/FM Cassette/CD, leather interior, cruise contro, 16" Wheels, standard
transmission. 69,000 Miles

Apparently there is a full service history available.

Here's my query. As I know virtually nothing about 911's, what would be
the most important things to look (and look out) for? Was this a good
year? By that I mean, were there known problems or issues with that
model of car/engine etc. Is 69k miles a lot for a 911? I would
appreciate any information that would be of value. Is there a FAQ that I
should be aware of?

I don't (yet) monitor the 911 list, so please send replies directly to
me at bwhiting@dlcwest.com

Thanks,
Bob Whiting
