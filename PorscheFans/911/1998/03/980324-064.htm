Tom - when you have engine out (though you really don't have to remove
the engine to get at the "rear" oil seal if you mean the one by the
alternator pulley) check the transmission shift shaft seal.  For that matter,
just pull the inspection plate on tunnel in front of rear seats.  If there is oil
there, that's it.  Coming out of the tunnel via the seat mounts sounds wild,
though.  Gasoline and hydraulic fluid are the only liquids which are
supposed to be in that tunnel, and then in good steel tubes which don't
seem to go bad.  Tranny oil usually has a distinctive smell to it.
