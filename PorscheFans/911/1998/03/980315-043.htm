Hi All,
I have been reading alot about synthetic oils on the list lately and I
would like to ask a few questions before I make any decisions on using a
different lubrication. I have no dought that synthetics are good 
to use, but I want to be sure I have the right conditions to switch to
synthetics. I have a car with 90,000 miles and have been using 20-50w
Castrol since I purchased the car last year. I change the oil every
3000-3500 miles (I have changed the oil 3 times since I got the car, if
any one cares). 

My questions are:
1. Does high milage cars matter when changing from conventional to
synthetics.
2. If it is not a problem (High Milage) what weight of oil should I use?
3. What about the tranny oil, is it a good idea to use synthetic oil?
4. Which is a good brand to use? (I have seen many brands at a variety
of prices).

 I know its alot of questions but thanks a bunch for reading!
Don
