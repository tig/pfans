Toby - I don't have a clue.  But I have some guesses.  Since your speedo
works fine in the shop, I would suspect that either there is an intermittent
open in the car's electrical supply to the speedo, or in the ground (on 77s
anyway the speedo ground is separate from the instrument light ground).
 Intermittent problems are what takes the boredom out of life, so good
luck following the various circuits (the ground oughtn't to be too taxing,
however) to some common destination with wires serving things which
always work.

Another way to check out this basic power supply theory would be to
wire a bulb across the positive and ground terminals of the speedo and
locate it somewhere where you can see it as you are driving.  It should
come on when  you turn the car on and stay on.  If it stays on when 
your speedo craps out, so much for another Fricke theory.  But if it goes
out in synch with the speedo, you know it is just a power supply wiring
problem.

If that doesn't produce an answer, I'd suspect the sender.  Did you take
that out and to the shop as well?  That's not as easy as pulling the
speedo.  And not so much the sender as the wires which carry its
message to the speedo, which have connectors, could get pinched (this
seems doubtful, though), etc.  As a last resort, you could just replace the
sender and see if that did any good.  Can't be that expensive.  The
sender responds each time a magnet (or is it magnets) attached to your
differential comes by, which creates the pulse which causes the
odometer to advance after enough pulses have been counted, and
which pulses are converted into a voltage to make the speedo needle
move (at least that is what it looks like is going on inside the speedo - I've
never seen a circuit diagram for it).  I don't know if gadgets like the
sender get cranky, although most electronic devices these days either
work fine or die, which is why the sender itself is low on my list of
suspects.  I don't think the sender is a reed contact (though it could be),
which would have moving parts.  As I recall, the speedo sender has two
wires attaching to it, one of which ends up back at the speedo on the
signal input lug, and the other ending up somewhere else - ground? 
Positive?  Were this my car's problem I'd check my circuit diagrams (at
home, or I wouldn't guess) and figure out where the other part of the
sender circuit attached to ground or to positive to see if that was the
source, well concealed, of the problem.

Good luck

(speedo didn't work in my car on purchase, because person who put a
USA speedo in it didn't realize that you had to connect the speedo
instrument ground to ground, and that the speedo case ground alone
didn't do the trick, with result that a diode in the speedo burned out,
which I discovered and repaired by dumb luck.  I guess VDO must have
built these so they could be run on positive ground cars, although why
they did this in 1977 is surely a mystery.  Who made positive ground cars
then?)
