I just picked up my SC from wrench today.  One of the things that I had him
check was the idle.  My car would take a real long time to settle at an
Idle and would often idle high 1200-1400, and very irregular.  He said that
the engine surges due to vacuum leaks at injector seals and intake gaskets.
 But the cause of the high idle was a sticky "idle air valve".  I guess he
oiled this up or something because the car now falls to an idle at 900 RPM
quickly and consistently.  

Vacuum leaks are a real problem on anything with fuel injection and this
could be part of your problem as well.  I would expect any Bosch CIS
injected cars of this vintage to be suffering from dried and cracked seals
and gaskets anywhere in the injection or induction system causing air leaks.
