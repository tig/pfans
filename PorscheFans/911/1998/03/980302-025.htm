James-
re: the clear film for headlights.  I don't have my Automotion catalog
handy, ('great bedside reading), but I did buy the film for the foglights on
my BMW 325.  Automotion said that they shot at this protective film with a
pellet gun and it did no harm.  Since my foglights are right in harm's way,
I decided to install the film on my "newly replaced" foglight lenses.  It's
a very thick, clear film, with a very strong adhesive on the back.
Well, everything looked alright, but then after a few weeks of driving with
my foglights on in the rain, I noticed a good sized crack (!) on both
lenses, identical in shape and size.  I concluded that the film must have
prevented the lenses from expanding, perhaps with the heat of the lenses vs.
cold rainwater coating the front of the film must have caused this.(?)
Dismayed, thinking that now I have to buy 2 more lenses @ $15 each, (I'll
actually wait until they look worse, I think), and that I'd spent the $30 or
so on the film that seems to have caused this damage-I called Automotion and
asked if they'd heard of similar experiences.
Terry (Automotion-great guy) said that he hadn't heard of any such problems,
but that he'd refund my $, and even credit me for shipping them back
(without having to actually return the "film") to offset my expense with
replacement lenses.  I was very happy with this service, and I'm still not
certain exactly what happened.  I'd like to hear from others if they've used
these protective film pieces with/without success....?
