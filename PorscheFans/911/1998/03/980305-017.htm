>I have a complete Air Conditioning setup for a 1973 911 for sale
> - too cold here - this is a dealer installed Behr unit, and is absolutely
>complete - right down to the tiniest nuts, bolts and clips. 
>The under dash controls/vents assembly nicely finishes off the under dash
>area which is kind of "busy" otherwise.  I also have the wiring diagram and
>the Behr warranty book. This was dealer-installed before delivery of the car,
>which was the standard then. This was the only way to get air conditioning in
>1973. $300.00.

>I also have a 1972 flywheel/pressure plate/throwout brg/disk $125.00, 

>A complete set of door panels/handles/etc (black) excellent. $150.00, 

>I also have an excellent Speedometer (MPH) for $125.00,

>A pair of good used (repacked) axles from my '73 for $225.00
>(that is what the dealers charge for the cores!!!...these showed only the
>slightest wear (polishing of the races only) I cleaned then out and repacked
>them using the original boots. They are put together the way they came apart
>and marked  (left inner, right outer, etc) The besy way to use them is to
>switch them over 180 degrees, ie left inner to become right inner. That makes
>the "coast" side the driven side and the CV's work like new.
>If you are interested I also have a 2.4 engine that came from my '73 911T. It
>is complete with heat exchangers and CIS. It ran fine but leaked oil and
>burned a little at startup. It would need at least an upper end rebuild. I
think it is worth $1500.00. 
Everything is plus UPS of course.

>**These prices are not firm and I will take offers on any or all.**
