=> Not to belabor this oil thread, but how often do you folks that run the
=> synthetic stuff change your oil?  I change my oil about every 3K and it
=> costs about $13 for a case of Castrol 20/50.  For synthetic at about $7
=> bucks a qt. ($84 a case) I figure the break even point is about 21,000
=> miles.

I run Redline in my Ford E150 van and change it every 5K miles. I also run a
Canton racing filter on the van too (doesn't bypass, 8 micron filtering). BTW,
I don't use this van for towing.

For my Porsche, I also use Redline and change it every 3K miles (haven't
decided whether I'm going to go to a racing filter yet).

Redline recommends that you can go as high as 18K between changes (or one
year), with a filter change at 9K (half way). The miles reduce as the vehicle
usage gets more demanding (towing, dusty conditions, performance driving). I
wouldn't go anywhere near this long for a Porsche. For a daily driver that
never sees autoX or big track events, at most 12K miles with a filter/1qt oil
at 6k??

I'm pretty fanatical about maximizing lubrication and plan to keep my vehicles
for a long time. With a new flat-6 costing $10K+, a few extra bucks for
synthetic are worth it.

Mobil-1 would be a good choice too for $3.5-$4/qt.
