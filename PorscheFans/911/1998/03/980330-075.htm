Hey all,

Okay need some help..

74 911 2.7 CIS.

In the morning it's starting to be a bit of a pain to start (I
don't like having to crank it 5 times). 
Anyways when it's warm it starts perfect and runs perfect.

Can anyone tell me the right way to start this car. It has that
lil throttle lever between my seat (I'm supposing it's like a
choke), but I'm also not used to having to give a fuel injected
car throttle/gas/pump the accelerator before I kick her over and
get her to run.


Also she is running pretty rich (normal?)

The car was smogged right before I bought it and am going to have
to smog it again since it was like 62 days after the smog so I
have to do it again.

Anyways here is what she rang up after blowing in the tube for a
bit at 2552 rpm.

HC(PPM) MAX:400 AVG:123 Mine:369 (ouch)
CO(%)   MAX:4.0 AVG:1.40Mine:.25 (better!)
CO2(%)                  Mine:13.1 (?)
O2(%)                   Mine:2.5 (?)
  
So by reading this any of you tune up/CIS pros have any opinions
why she seems to run rich?
Also please please please help me with my cold start problem..

Thanks :)

Tory
