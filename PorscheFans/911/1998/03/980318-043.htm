John - I'd be so bold as to offer the opinion that Porsche electrical
systems are not that much different than electrical systems in most motor
vehicles.  Batteries get old and die, unwanted drains on otherwise good
batteries develop in mysterious places, alternator brushes wear out,
diodes fry, regulators crap out, switch contacts can go bad, solenoids
get baulky, starter motors wear out, new replacement parts sometimes
have manufacturer's defects and don't work, and connectors loosen or
corrode increasing resistance and  cutting voltage at the starter.  A
circuit diagram is as useful as on any car in figuring out which wires to
check where, and a VOM can tell you a lot.

Aside from these ordinary matters, it is useful to know that for many
years (I don't know about the most recent cars) the engine ground strap
comes off the front of the tranny and attaches to the body sheet metal in
front of the rear right side torsion tube.  

Also,  I went for years without knowing that the alternator warning light
also served to "excite" the diodes in the alternator, so a burned out,
grounded, disconnected, missing, or otherwise messed up light bulb up
in the instruments could be the cause of the alternator not functioning.  I
hadn't even bothered to hook this up in my race car and wondered why
the alternator wasn't working until someone straightened me out. 
Perhaps most cars have this feature.  Before I switched to Porsche
designed air cooled engined cars I owned cars with generators instead,
which didn't need external excitement I guess.  Recently a List member
reported a baffling gremlin (which he "solved" in the time honored
manner of taking something malfunctioning apart, finding nothing
apparently wrong, putting it back together, and finding it now worked)
related to this light. 

So if you are at home with this system on other cars you should feel
right at home here once you figure out what attaches where  (which is
hardly mysterious).
