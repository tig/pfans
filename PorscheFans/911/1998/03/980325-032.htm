They are indeed a friction fit. They are a VERY TIGHT friction fit.

I removed mine a couple of weeks ago to straighten them and clean up the
rubber seals a bit.

I found it much easier to remove the smallest gauge (clock or gas/oil level)
and work my way in to the bigger gauges - the smaller ones come out more
easily, and with them out you can get your hands in and push the bigger
ones from behind.

I had to use a screwdriver to VERY VERY CAREFULLY apply pressure to pry the
gas/oil level gauge out. I was very concerned, naturally, that the 
screwdriver would slip and gouge the gauge bezel, so I applied only as much
pressure as necessary, and like I said, I was VERY VERY CAREFUL ;^)

Even with all the other gauges out, the tach was a bitch. I had both hands
in the dash pulling it from behind and was thrusting my whole body back
in the seat while making strange grunting noises. Eventually it came out...

Cheers,

Ross
