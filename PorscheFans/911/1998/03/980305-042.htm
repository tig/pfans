I've said this a bunch of times, and I'lll say it again now,

1) I've had my 993 up to 140 MPH on the track w/o the panel,
it is totally stable - not bothered by mild crosswiinds.

2) Porsche started putting on an undertray on 911s back around
'87 (described in in a Model Year Intro pamphlet), put in cars
for Switzerland to cut down on noise emission.  I think with tighter
noise emission laws, expanded it to all markets in 964.   Keep in mind
this is another reason Porsche had to go to water cooling eventually.

Fans,

I had chance to discuss with the local Porsche rep several matters =
including the removal of the engine undertray on my 993. Specifically as =
regards the cooling issue Porsche has instructed dealers not to remove =
the undertray. Evidently almost all of the cooling of the engine occurs =
from air moving over the top of the car and down on to the engine. Air =
moving under the car is not "swept up" in fact it is pushed down ( the =
air pushing down is what causes the rear end to lift as speed is =
increased) and therefore air flowing under the car does practically =
nothing to cool the engine. In fact it is the opposite. The engine =
undertray is specifically designed to eliminate (as much as is possible) =
turbulence which occurs when air moving under the car buffers against =
air moving down and over the engine. Evidently, if you remove the rear =
engine undertray, the air pressure under the car pushing up buffets =
against the air moving down. Of this occurs at the bottom of the engine =
and up - and hence removing the tray causes substantial air turbulence =
right where it is least desired - around the engine. This turbulence =
substantially effects (reduces) the ability for fresh cool air to flow =
continuously over the motor and therefore removing the undertray leads =
to a hotter running engine not a cooler running engine.

Hopefully, I have done justice to his explanation.
