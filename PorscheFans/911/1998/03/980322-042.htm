Hi All,
    I'm having problems with my 81 930(with 87 motor and brain). Lately when I
put the car under load,  the car shudders and bucks as I accelerate. The motor
idles fine at 1000 rpm but around 3000 rpm's the motor runs erratically. The
problem has been getting worse as before it would do this very mildly,  now
it's getting pretty bad. Another thing I noticed was that there is an oily
residue in the turbo to intercooler pipe(and probably the intercooler too).
Could the turbo be going out? I was thinking it might be the fuel pump too;
does the 81 have one in the tank as well as the rear? Thanks in advance-Sean
.
