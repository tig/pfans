Hi. sorry to tell you this, but you need the hand throttle to start the 
car (especially when cold). I also have a 74 911, and what I do is to 
lift the throttle then turn the key to run. I let the fuel pump run for 
about 5 seconds then hit the starter. Usually starts the first (for sure 
the second) time. The owners manual says to push the hand throttle down 
after about a minute or after the car warms up a bit. A hot start can be 
done with the hand throttle or the the gas pedal, I use the gas pedal(it 
idles better). I hope this helps a bit, good luck and happy Porsching.
