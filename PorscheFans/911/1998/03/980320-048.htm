Robert has already summarized the sound deadening issue. I want to make a
comment regarding tweeter placement. The rear deck speakers fire directly up
to the sloped rear window. This seems like it would do a good job of
reflecting and dispersing the highs from the tweeters. I haven't actually
tried this yet (my '86 had the stock speakers on the read deck; I only
replaced the door speakers), but on my next 911 I will definitely put
speakers with good tweeters on the rear deck.

Yes, the 911 makes sweets sounds of its own. However, there are those of us
who just have to listen to tunes from time to time. In a 911 you need a fair
amount of power, and the speakers to handle it, to be able to hear music
clearly above the car sounds.

Someone else mentioned that you need lots of room to produce good bass. That
is true of the speaker baffle cavity. However on the output side of the
speaker, the smaller the area the less power you will need. Since a 911 has
a small interior volume, it doesn't take a whole lot of bass-specific power.
I got great sound from a pair of 6" Keff speakers in the doors driven by a
60 watt Sound Stream amp (the Keffs are two way speakers with a HUGE
external crossover). Now if you want to listen to hip-hop at
denture-loosening sound levels, well, no comment. :-0
