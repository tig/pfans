Burl,

If you email Red Line ('redline@redlineoil.com'), they will send you
a list of distributors/dealers.

In fact, their web site (http://www.redlineoil.com) lists a Canadian
distributor in Concord, Ontario - Motorsport Technology at 905-660-6614

I sent them email and asked about proper oil weights, etc, for my car. Had
a fairly quick response, though they suggested their 10w40 weight which
seems odd as they have a 15w50 and 20w50 as well. Ask them which of their
gear lubes to use for your particular car, and tell them whether you've got
limited slip or not.

Question for Andy Warren (who I know is a fan of Red Line... this'll be
a test to see if he READS everything as well as *knowing* everything ;^)
What weight would you use (for motor oil)? My car's a '90 C2, primarily
street driven, in a moderate climate (Vancouver, B.C.)

Cheers!

Ross
