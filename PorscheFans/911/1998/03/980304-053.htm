Jim--
The hood of my '68 coupe gave me fits when I first got it back from the
restoration shop. First, it would pop open every time I hit a bump or put
any stress on the suspension. The body shop and I fiddled with it for
hours, and the best we could do was to get to where it stayed closed, but
took two people to open (one pulling the knob, the other ppressing up and
down on the passenger side of the hood until the latch released). Obviously
a very unsatisfactory solution. There are three adjustment points, the two
rubber bumpers on either side that can be screwed in and out; and the latch
itself, which can also be screwed in and out. I finally gave up on getting
it right myself, and took it to my regular mechanic who knows a lot about
older cars. He fiddled with it for about half an hour and got it perfect.
Cost me about $35, but saved me that much or more in frustration.
