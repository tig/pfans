I just pulled my right side exhaust valve cover as I thought it
was cracked, wasn't just missing paint that made it feel like a
crack. But it was leaking as the gasket is kind of tired but
doesn't look too bad, a real nice rubber gasket.

Anyway the cover I have on there now is like a black flat cover no
ridges or anything
Part # 801.105.116.OR

The new one I got is a all silver and a bit heavier, more
material, with  grooves and such, not flat.
part # 930.105.116.OR

Just thinking it's the later part # and it's heavier duty for a
reason..

Anyone care to comment, is it okay to change the older one to the
new one I just recieved?

The entire package with complete gasket set, washers nuts etc was
only about $50.00 including the valve cover. $18.00 for the gasket
kit and $34.00 for the cover.. It's good to have connections..

Thanks for any reassuring comments on swapping covers.

Thanks Tory

I also took a pic of the open exhaust valve area in case I need to
check in there for a must do upgrade. Just to see if it was
already done..

Thanks again.. Oops another thanks. Darn I did it again..
