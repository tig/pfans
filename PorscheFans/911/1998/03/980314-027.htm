This happened to me after a repair, they drained the battery.  Upon
reconnection/boosting it, I had to take it to the p-car dealer to have
their service guy 'reset the computer code' for low voltage.

Cost me 25 bucks plus a 2 hour drive to the newest dealer.

I hope there is a better way.

I have a 92 C2 which recently had a heater AC unit installed at great
expense.  No more battery draw down. I can now get in my car being
satisfied it will start each time.  Of course my calm was short lived.
Now the air bag light re-lights after the initial testing at
start-up.(eg it stays on for a few seconds then goes off for second or
two and then re-lights and stays lit until the car is turned off.)
I think this happened one time last year on one start up.  I suppose I
have connection problem. Any one have the same problem? Any idea where
the sensors are which should be checked for tight connections. Any
advice would save me a 2 hour drive to the nearest Porsche repairman.
