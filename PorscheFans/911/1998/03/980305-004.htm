There have been a few posts related to Luis Guerra's original:

Most of the responses related to the 4 wheel drive of the C4's; however,

I've  had  the same thing happen on my C2S.  A couple of days ago I was
trying to get a very solid launch from my C2S.  One method I used was
EXACTLY the same method as Luis.  4 grand, drop the clutch and full in
on the throttle. (not atypical on certain cars)  The clutch just didn't
grab.   I have the extra wide tires on 18 inch rims, so there's a heck
of a lot torque required; however, I was pretty surprised at the results

considering Porsches stated 0-60 times, and various magazine reviews
I've read.

Needless to say, I didn't continue my attempts.  Trial and error starts
can get very costly very quickly.  I'm new to Porsches so I figured it
best to ask the experts
in the audience.  Can anyone recommend the "best" method for quick
standing starts that don't completely torch the clutch?  Thanks.
