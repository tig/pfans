I love my month-old 1987 Carrera coupe (G.P. white/olive-green-gray), but
I'm confused about something that I hope you pundits can help me with.

A graph in the appendix to the owner's manual shows that at 60 mph the
engine should be turning at 2500 revs, in fifth gear. Instead, it's turning
at 2850. At 70 mph it's at 3100. Because of those high revs, my fuel
economy isn't what it should be, and noise and engine wear are increased.
The car came with 15" wheels but now has 16" wheels. Maybe that explains
the discrepancy? If not, then what does?

I can anticipate one response: "This is a high-revving sports car by
design." And I also imagine that because this is a car with its roots in
racing and because more power is available at the higher revs, this gearing
favors speed over economy.

But isn't the car also supposed to be a Grand Touring vehicle? Is there any
way to add an overdrive, or to lower the gearing (without spending a
fortune?  Is there any other fix I haven't thought of?

Thanks in advance for any feedback.
