Torque wrenches.

I have a Craftsman beam style, two cheap clickers and a new clicker. I shopped
around for the new clicker style and purchased mine at Home Depot (It is a
Husky tool) and I like it.  Thought I'd summarize the advantages and
disadvantages for those that still care:

Beam Style:

Advantage:
Provides continuous feedback of the Torque applied if you can see the beam.
Stays in Calibration longer (perhaps forever).

Disadvantage:
Not so easy to see the beam in a lot of applications and more difficult than
clicker to apply 'precise torque' (such as 156 ft lbs).  I realize that the
clicker is calibrated to X% accuracy (so is the beam) but try to get your beam
reading right at 156 while you are applying that much torque (if you are Eric
Williams or Reggie white
it might be easy for you) not so easy for me.

Clicker Style:

Advantage:
Easy to know when you have your torque (assumes you can hear the click) from
any position  (laying down, kneeling, applying 156 ft lbs to steering knuckle
bolts on a Toyota etc.).

Disadvantage:
If they are out of calibration then the sound  you think is clicking might be
your bolt tearing away  (not much fun there).

Bottom Line:  You might want both. Then you could periodically check  your
Clicker Calibration on your wheel lugs with the beam wrench if you want.
Apply 50 ft lbs with the beam and check to see that your clicker clicks at 45
ft lbs.  Check again at various stages up to the 94 ft lbs of torque.  Never
have checked my clicker though.

2.) Targa Bar Paint

I painted my Targa bar on the car, a definate improvement over what it was
(some of the metal was showing through on mine too, a ''78 SC 97K miles).  I
used a 'plasti-kote' bumper black flexible acrylic paint which "might" give
you the texture you want.  Got it at Pep Boys for about 6 bucks for a can (not
cheap paint).   I've had to sand my paint down (to remove imperfections) with
600 then 2000 grit wet dry sandpaper so the texture is pretty smooth in places
but the bar is black.  Used a paint brush to touch up spots around the Targa
emblems.  Okay, it is not a  perfect factory OEM job,  but it is a definate
improvement and only cost me 10 bucks and about 3 or so hours of time.
