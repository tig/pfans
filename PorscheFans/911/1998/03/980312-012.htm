First, the oil pressure gauge has been acting up in my -84 carrera.  The
needle jumps to the top of the scale as soon as the ignition is turned on.
I'm sure I need to replace the sender unit; however, I don't know where its
located on the engine.  Can anyone help?.  Second, I would like to replace the
oil temp ticker scale with a numeric one, which also required a new sender
unit.  Where is this sender unit located on the engine and does anyone have
any advice on replacing gauge scale? 
 Third, the targa side & rollbar seal need to be replaced due to the excessive
wind noise inside the car.  The side seal replacement is simple enough but
what about the rear rollbar seal?  Have any of you been through this recently?
Any help on the three items would be greatly appreciated.
