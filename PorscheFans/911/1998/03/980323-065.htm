Perhaps someone can shed some light on an interesting situation I am =
experiencing.  Took my car to my P-wrench several months ago for a cold =
start problem.  After much work, it was determined that I needed a new =
aux. air valve and a new warm-up regulator.  This was the second warm up =
regulator in 6 months, and I simply wrote it off as a bad unit from a =
different wrench.  Well, this cured the cold start problem and the car =
ran like a scalded dog.  BUT the mpg was down 25% and the idle would not =
take a set.  Adjust it to 1000 rpm and it would run up to 2000 rpm.  =
Adjust again and in a day or 2, it would be down to 600 rpm.  Back to =
the P wrench.  Fuel pressures were immediately checked and found to be =
out of spec.  After 6 days of exploratory surgery, another new warm up =
regulator (this one under warranty) and everything "appears" to be =
right. =20

In case this unit goes out, does anyone have an idea what could be =
causing this series of failures other than plain bad luck?
