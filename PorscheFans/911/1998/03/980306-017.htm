One thing I would suggest is to make sure your particular tire sizes are
intended for use on a particular wheel size.  I know that for R1s you
can only use up to a 205/55/R16 on the front 6" wide rim, the 225s are
too wide to work properly. <<

Actually that is backwards - the R1s will work fine on rims that
are 1" narrower than standard. 225/50s will work OK on a 6"
rim, especially on the front which has light weight. 245s will
be OK on a 7" too. But wide street tires with soft sidewalls will not
function well on these narrow rims. I have found that 225/50/15
all around on 6 x 15" rims are the best on an early 911 and don't
rub much. (we have to use 6" to stay in SCCA stock class,
of course 7" would be better).

and  Gregory Deschodt <GDeschodt@synon.com> asked :

>> reason I ask this is because the same brochure states that the max size
you can mount on the 7"rear wheels is 215....

So, if I want 205/225 on my car, must I upgrade to 7and 8 wheels or can
I stay with my 6 and 7 ?  ;-)   <<

No, even with street tires you can run 205/225 on 6s and 7s
with no problems whatever.
