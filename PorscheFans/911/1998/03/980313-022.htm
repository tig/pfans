I have a 72 911T with the Optima battery. I first mounted it on the 
drivers side of the car and then later switched to the passenger side 
to try to balance the car better (just a hunch, I have not had it on 
the scales). I turned the battery sideways and put it in the stock 
battery box. I used the stock  type retainers, but fabricated a sheet 
metal "extender" to make the stock retainer fit the optima battery. 
The "extender" was just a piece if flat sheet metal with curved ends 
to connect to the stock mounting.  To move the battery to the 
passenger side, I used a piece of welding cable to provide the 
additional length. This will prevent the full size spare tire from 
fitting in the stock location. I use the car primarily for limited 
street and autocross, so I was not too concerned about that aspect. 
Good luck. Tom Oxner
