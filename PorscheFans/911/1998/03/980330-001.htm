I've driven, both on open roads and track, 964s(plain, turbo and C4) and
993s (plain and C4S) and I have found just the regular (maybe less)
differences you can find in cars with a 5 year gap. No miracles. I have too
say that in my experience you can say the same also comparing a late 3.2
Carrera with 205/16 - 225/16 (actually my own was very lowered and
stiffened) with a 964. Just a different feeling from a 964 but, torsion bars
or springs, you can drive a post '78 (and, maybe, earlier) 911 with the same
confidence. If handling is the only reason to switch for a 993 from a 964, a
better way to invest your money is attending some serious driving school.
That will be a great improvement in general performances. Please, don't
believe the blah-blah that car magazines make whenever a new model is
introduced; the biz must go on...
