Hi Pfans:
I am worried that my engine oil is not getting warm enough.  Yesterday =
the outside air temperature
(OAT) was about 35 degrees fahrenheit, at highway speeds the oil temp =
never exceeded 150 degrees
with a corresponding 4.75 bar oil pressure at 3200 rpm which would rise =
to 5.0 bar upon
acceleration. During the entire 250 mile trip the oil pressure was =
between 4.00 - 5.00 bar.  When I
felt the lines going up to the 28 tube brass cooler in the front fender =
it was not hot but the left
side of it was slightly warm, the fittings and hoses leading to and from =
it were a little warmer
yet.  The lines leading to and from and the thermostat itself were all =
very warm, the oil tank was
hot.  Could the thermostat be stuck partially open? I thought that it was=
 supposed to open when
engine oil reaches 180 degrees fahrenheit.  Haw hard is it on the engine =
to run this temp of oil?

Thanks for your help.
