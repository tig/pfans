    Aldo:

    I don't mean to shatter your illusions, but Mercedes-Benz has
    nothing on Porsche when it comes to stretching the rules.  The
    935 was the best-known example, and the entry of a 962 as a 
    "street-legal" car at Le Mans two years ago was the most
    egregious.

    I don't think so; the widely-reported problems with the A-Class
    and Smart cars came to light about a year after the Mercedes
    GT-1 car was unveiled.
