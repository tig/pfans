Stan:

You don't HAVE to do ANYTHING... It's your car; do what you like.

With that said... The bearings in your turbocharger will live longer
if you take a cool-down lap or travel the last couple miles of your
journey at a relaxed pace, then let the engine idle for a minute or
two after stopping.  If you're usually in too much of a hurry to sit
in your car for a minute after stopping, you can buy a "turbo timer"
that will run the engine for a few minutes even after you remove the 
key and exit the car.

Your entire engine, by the way, will also last longer if you let the 
car warm up BEFORE driving it hard.
