My '78 Euro SC Targa was just attacked by one of those mysterious moving
trees (don't ask).  Anyway, it clipped my left rear bumper, hitting the big
rubber thingymajig (bumper bumper?; has license plate lights in it) and
cracking the tail light lens.  I figure I should update to the US version
(or later model?) of the bumper that has the much larger rubber
thingymajigs--mine are about 5 inches across.  SO, can anyone offer the
following information?
1. Is there a specific year that US models went to the larger rubber
thingymajigs or were they always larger for US SCs?
2. Where could I come across a nice, used, relatively inexpensive rear
bumper with these wider rubber thingymajigs?
3. How about used rear tail light lenses?  Mine are the original Euro
lenses that were painted on the inside to pass DOT.

I keep telling myself that this is really a blessing in disguise since it
will allow me to update both the bumper and lenses . . . ;-( . . . right?

TIA,
Scott
