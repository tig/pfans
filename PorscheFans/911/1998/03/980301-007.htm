One might argue that all cars are air-cooled ;-) Forget posting a response
mentioning the boat-car. Once it enters the water it isn't a car anymore.
Anyway, the 911 (up until 996) is technically both air and oil-cooled in
that hot oil is sent through heat exchangers for cooling and air is blown
over the engine as well. The 996 is probably air-water-and-oil cooled. I
say probably because I am guessing it still has an oil cooler somewhere.

Is there an air-cooled or water-cooled only engine? I suppose you could
declare this to be the case if oil was not put through a heat-exchanger. In
fact, the simplest taxonomy would be to say that the engine is cooled based
on the primary heat removing medium at the engine. Otherwise, you are back
to the argument that air cools all engines.
