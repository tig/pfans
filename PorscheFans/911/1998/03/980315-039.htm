Someone asked "Why can't we just order the EU spec Porsche springs and use
them?" (was it Kevin?)  You can.  I did.  It worked great, but was a royal
hassle.  I ended up with the same supension that a European C4S would have by
ordering, through a European relative, what a European C4S would have. I love
it, but it took about three months and a lot of long-distance telephone calls
following a personal visit to Zonderwerks.  So it is not a perfect solution.

Reasons not to do it:
1 It is much easier to buy an Eibach or H&R kit.  And you may never be able to
tell the difference in those and "real" Porsche springs.
2 Any 993 owner that bought an Eibach or H&R kit, and US dealers or
aftermarket suppliers that sell their own, will swear that theirs is better,
somehow, than Porsche's factory springs that you'll have on your car. This can
wear on you over time.
3 There are 3 suspensions for 993s over there, not just two.  The lowest is
called, by the Zonderwerks engineers, some German phrase for "grass cutter".
You don't want it.  It necessitates changing other suspension pieces as well.
4 Your dealer will not appreciate you doing this because 1) they didn't know
you could do it 2) they think Porsche is selling "around" them to you 3) they
have no clue 4) they feel they have a right to keep you in the dark and 5)
they may be selling their own kits 6) they feel threatened when you learn
things they didn't know, despite the fact that they don't care about learning
these things themselves.
5 At DE or other club events, you'll be made to feel like a simpleton because
you just bought the "same ol'" springs that Porsche puts on their European
cars, instead of some exotic Eibach, H&R or trick Andial kit.
6 The Andial kit, I have been told, has a return guarantee of some kind if you
don't like the result.  Porsche's don't.
7 Porsche does not really want you to do this because they have an exclusive
selling agreement with PCNA and no one there wants their name to be used as a
"contact" helping you do this.


Reasons to go through the effort to get OEM springs FROM Porsche in Europe:
1 It is no more expensive. (but see #5 below)
2 There are a lot of people out there who say they are selling "real" Porsche
springs and/or that their kit is better than "real" OEM springs.  No one yet
has come up with a perfect way to separate the wheat from chaff.
3 If you call 5 dealers and 5 aftermarket tuners, you'll get 13 different
opinions.
4 We buy these cars because they are engineered like no other. Because I do
not have hundreds of skilled engineers and race car tuners working for me, nor
a chasis testing and engine shop, nor a world-famous test track in my back
yard, nor roughly 20,000 race victories under my belt, I do not presume to be
able to improve on Porsche's suspension (or muffler) formula.  Paddock talk
and shared opinion works for stuff like which leather cleaner works best.  But
when I go onto a curve at high speed I can't worry whether I should have put
my life on the line based on somebody telling me their best friend's cousin
swears a certain set-up he just happened to find is "the ticket." 
5 You may get a trip to Porsche out of it.
6 Along with aftermarket springs (even the ones they say are OEM) you'll get a
number of opinions indicating you should also change anti-sway bars, shocks,
spacers, offsets, sunvisors (and no telling what else that they just happen to
sell).  You'll never get a truly authoritative answer that you can trust as
unbiased.
7 If you are the type that does not monkey with a known good thing, even if
everyone has told you they beat Porsche's best with a few more horsepower or
better spring combination, then it is worth the hassle to get the European OEM
springs from Porsche. 

You'll need at least:
Friend in Europe (or a personal visit)
German microfiche (or a really good friend in Europe)
German-speaking friend (or bring the springs back with you)
Or, a really good friend here with dealer parts connections that you trust
implicitly
Time and patience
Ability to ignore everyone else's hearsay tidbit
Your car's options (there is no one spring for each car - it varies based on
options)

Jack, C4S
