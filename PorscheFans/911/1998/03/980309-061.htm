Saturday morning I was heading out early in the C2. I went to start my
car which usually fires right up. I turn the key and crank it the
normal couple of seconds and nothing. I turn the key again, this time
for maybe 10 seconds of cranking and it still won't catch. Another
round of cranking, maybe 15 seconds and it finally fires up. I've only
owned this car for 3 months, but this was the first time it was
anywhere near that difficult to start. After it started, there seemed
to be an odor of unburned fuel in the exhaust? BTW, I don't touch the gas
pedal during starts.

I stopped for gas on my way out (1/8th of a tank, no "low fuel" light
yet).  When I started after that stop, it started ok, but maybe still a
little slow to catch. Once the car was warmed that day, it started fine
and has continued to start fine.

Is this a warning of an impending problem? Or just a random anomaly,
not uncommon with these cars?

Specs on car:	1992 N/A C2 (5spd)
		38,000 miles
		Autothority chip
		Only runs on 92 octane gas (Union 76 or Chevron)
		Negligible oil usage

The only extraordinary event I can think of was Friday night, when I pulled
into the garage (I have a steep driveway), I inadvertantly lugged the engine
(almost stalled), to the point where I heard pinging, pulling up my driveway.
Could it be that I fouled the plugs just before shutting it down?

I'm probably being paranoid, but if this is related to a known problem, I
would like to get on top of it ASAP.

Thanks in advance!
