911 *T*  is for Touring, a model begun in 1968 and ended in 1973.  In
1974, a 'normal' 911, a 911S, and a 911 Carrera were made for the US,
all with 2.7L engines.  A plain 911 engine for 1974 should begin with
614 followed by a four digit sequence number.  S and Carrera engines
should begin with 634.  The engine number should be just behind and to
the right of the fan housing on a vertical support member.  I believe
you are correct that no production car ever had a 2.7L turbo engine.
Whatever number you find on your engine, the only way to verify that it
came with the car is to get the cardex documentation from Porsche.

I'll recommend the same books as before, plus a few others:
Technical Specification manual (for a '74 is part number WKD.422.121)
Parts and Technical Reference Catalog, 911 Models 1974-1989 (PNA 000
147)
Bruce Anderson's 'Porsche 911 Performance Handbook'
Paul Frere's 'Porsche 911 Story'
Porter and Morgan's 'Porsche 911 Purchase and Restoration Guide'
Stoddard's Porsche 911 Catalog

Total cost for all of these should be $100 or so.  Think of it this
way:  If you bought a very fine wine, you'd store it in a wine cellar.
If you bought a box of Macanudo 1984 Vintage Cabinet cigars, you'd store
it in a humidor.  Store your vintage Porsche in a garage, get the books,
and enjoy!  You want to faint, start replacing systems (brakes,
suspension, oil coolers, valves, P&C, etc.)....

Glad you're enjoying your car.  As for your questions, ask away...
