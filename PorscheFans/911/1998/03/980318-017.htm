Hi Juergen, and Pfans,

I had the same problem you are having with my 73 Targa.  I hunted around =
and checked all kinds of things.  It turned out that my alternator was =
overcharging and 911's don't like it.  They start losing power and =
surging and backfiring.  In my 73 which is most likely the same as yours =
I had a Marchal external voltage regulator (911 came with 3 different =
types at the time).  It was shot.  therefore wasn't regulating the =
voltage at the 13.8- 14.2 volts.  I had over 17 volts going to the car.  =
This made the car act like it was out of gas or short on power.  I =
thought it was quite strange at the time.  I asked around and explained =
the situation to a few shops in tha rea and was told that I had a faulty =
regulator.  I changed it and have had no problems since.  I recommend =
checking your charging output from your alternator as it is quite a =
simple inexpensive test to rule this out.   I hope you solve the problem =
soon, whatever it is

Good Luck
