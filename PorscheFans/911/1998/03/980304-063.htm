I have an 80 911SC and lately have been hearing some detonation between
1500-2000 RPM under moderate load.  I try not to lug the engine around =
in
this range but inevitably you end up there once in a while.  I am using =
92
octane gas, so I don't imagine that's the problem.  I recently had some
work done including the CO and timing being set (by Porsche), so I =
assume
that's not the cause.  Any suggestions?  The car is probably due for a
valve adjustment.  Could this be the cause?  Incidentally, the car also
misses a bit between 2-2500 RPM under normal driving conditions.  Could
this be related? =20

Any sage advice welcome!
