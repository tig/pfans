Luis, couple more ideas.  Could be either

1) Air in lines; don't ask me what got it in there to begin with (did you push
down on the brake pedal at any time while pads were out of caliper)?

2) Bad master cylinder

3) Even though pads are new,  they apparently bedded in on the old 
warped rotors.  They might have to bed in against the cut rotors, or else
you need new pads to fit properly against cut rotors.  My experience
with new pads is I get your phenomena for a few hundred miles, although
prob. not as bad as you indicate.

First thing I would do is bleed the brakes.  Now, in my experience, I have 
had a lot of bad luck with the standard procedure of having someone pump
tyhe brake pedal and hold it, while someone else opens the bleed screws.
Went through 2 master cylinders on my old '76  bleeding brakes this way
before and after driver's schools.  I now use a pressure bleeder, which is a
large 
air tank pressurizer to about 20 psi, connnected to a tire valve that is 
screwed into a spare brake reservoir cap.  I remove the OE cap, install
my cap/valve arrangement, connect to the air tank, then commence bleeding.  
I have found with my 993 takes a lot of fluid movement to really bleed them;
Your C4 has a hydraulic pressure assist I believe (not vacuum
like on my C2 993); this makes bleeding harder, from what I understand.
This method has not given me trouble in approx. 100,000 miles on my old
'84 and now about 25,000 on the 993.  Also, best to do it in sequence
of right rear, left rear, right front, left front.

<< 
 Ray and Pfans,
 
 Thanks for your reply. None of the three answers apply to my problem though.
 
 The car has brand new brake pads that the PO had installed about two months
 ago at my request before purchasing the car.
 
 I had the rotors turned because they were warped so they were vibrating
 quite a bit when applying the brakes.
 
 I took the calipers out without loosing up the brake lines.  Very carefully.
 
 So, I am suspecting that the brake master cylinder might be allowing brake
 fluid blow by.  The wear thing though is that the brakes were perfect until
 I took the disks out, have them turned and installed back.  Completely
 unexplainable.
 
 I put 25 miles on the car today.  The brakes are grabbing dangerously low
 but again, if I pump the brake pedal, they grab high and nice for a few
 seconds.
 
 Can anyone help?
 
 Luis
