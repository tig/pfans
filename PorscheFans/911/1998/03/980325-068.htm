Terry,

Long time no Porsche chattin'.  My 87 coupe has a factory bracket that can
be bolted down into one of the few threaded mounting points.  This is what
allowed me to accommodate the once previous Interstate 'cube' battery.
There are 3 mounting holes where an 'L' bracket can bolt into.  I assume
these wholes are measured out to accommodate the industry battery sizes.

Joe

PS - Still no word on how to get the plastic A/C ball in my condenser to
float.  A/C seems to be cold, however the ball just doesn't float as it
should to indicate a fully charged system even after charging.  I just want
to ensure maximum efficiency of the A/C unit.

Any ideas?
