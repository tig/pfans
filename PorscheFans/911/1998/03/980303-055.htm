John Richardson - these tie rod inners (which are a ball joint) are
extremely stiff when new, at least mine were, and yours are, so that is
probably the norm.  Eliminating play  leads us to use these.  Makes it hard
to turn when adjusting the toe.  After 3 years my race car's ends are
getting more manageable in that regard.

I thought I could give answers to your other questions off the top of my
head, but decided I didn't really have whole thing memorized.  The old
inners are screwed in and held in proper orientation with a locking
device, a disk as I recall, which maybe doubles as the boot attachment. 
Loosen this and they'll screw out.   If someone else doesn't give you the
right skinney on the rest I'll look it up, but I recall the spacers go where
you think they go - between the ball unit and the rack end.  I've never
owned a 930 so I don't know if they have a different (wider) rack and
hence don't need the spacers.
