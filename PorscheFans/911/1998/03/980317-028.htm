To the collective:

I have a 1970 911 T with Webers.  Given its recent running problems, I
suspect that the fuel pump is beginning to fail.  With the fuel pump on
and the engine off, the fuel comes out of the line in surges; not the
continuous flow that I would have expected.  Is the surging normal or
should I be looking elsewhere for my running problems?

Assuming the problem is the fuel pump, what are opinions on replacement?
Replace/rebuild with original type or go with a Facet type?  Others?

Also,  given the location the 911 fuel pump, do I need to drain the gas
tank before replacing?

FYI, the following are my symptoms and what I have done in search of a
cure:

Symptoms:
Car will run for only 5 to 7 minutes and then lose power and eventually
just die.

After quitting, and sitting for about 2 or 3 minutes the car can be
restarted and the process starts over.

The car will sputter when going around a corner moderately fast.

When the power loss comes on, if I put the car in neutral and pull over,
it will idle poorly for a few minutes and then return to a smooth idle.
Again I can then take off and drive for another 5 to 7 minutes before
the process begins again.

What I have done:
I replaced the fuel filter despite having just done so a few weeks back
as part of my routine over maintenance.

Checked the float level of the Webers;  okay.

Checked the mixture; okay.

Checked the balance of the Webers; okay

I took apart and cleaned my Webers.

I checked all ignition related items (spark, points, dwell, advance. .
);  everything is good.

Thanks for any input.
