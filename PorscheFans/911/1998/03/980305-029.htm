I have had to remove the original sound deadening material in the engine
compartment of by 86 Carrera Coupe for it has deteriorated with age and was
falling apart.  Obviously, replacement is no problem with the engine removed,
but has anyone attempted to replace this material with the engine installed?
It looks as though it may be possible if you remove the air box, heater
blower, and cruise control and progressively apply adhesive from the bottom up
as you work the material into position.   I do not anticipate engine removal
for other purposes in the near future for the clutch was replaced by the
dealer about a year ago. I would appreciate hearing about any relevant
experience anyone has had with this process.  I am the original owner and want
to keep the car in top condition. The material cost about $70, so obviously I
don't want to begin a process that is doomed from the start if that is the
case.  Although I have pulled engines on numerous VW bugs and a 914, I have
never tried a 911. Thanks for any help forthcoming. Gene
