Peter,

I've gone through several sets of pads, and had my disks turned
once.  There's been no ill effect.  So, I suggest you take off
your disks, take them to a decent shop, get them measured.  If
they are within spec, get them turned.  Again, as long as they
are within Porsche tolerances, it's fine.

Note: These disks have a larger center hole than most normal cars.
I had to look around a bit before I found a shop with a disk lathe
that could adjust to properly mount them.  I would call a shop and
tell them "I have '87 911 disks that I want turned".  They would
say "Sure, bring them down".  Then, when I handed them the disks,
they would say "Ahhh, I don't think our machine can take these".
So, just be prepared to look around a little.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
'87 911 Targa
