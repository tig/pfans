Hi Tony,

>I have several things I would like to ask you about the 1982 911 I
bought
>in Nov.

Congratiolations, I just bought a '83 SC three weeks ago. I can't answer
all your questions but I can probably give you some hints.

>1. The Headlight washers don't work. The fuse is fine and the relay
clicks
>when the lights are on - but no water.  Anything?

I have same problem but haven't looked at it further. I'm thinking of
these things to check, though:

- Is there water in the tank ?
- Check the tubes to the nozles on the bumber. Mine needs to be
replaced. Any loose clamps which will cause a leak ?
- I don't know if there is a separate pump, but on many other cars there
is, check to see if it gets power ? Many times it sits build in the
water tank, and can get hard to reach.
- Checked the nozles ? are they clugged with wax ? loose one of the
tubes so you can see water comming out if not then the problem is closer
to the tank.

No real comment on 2 and 3.

>4. Are there lights that come on at the vent controls? right now it is
>always dark.

Mine has some light in the vent controls, not much though. It all
depends on how the upper lever is placed. If the fan is on the there is
more ilumination in the scale the whan it's off. Could be a loose
connection ? The light only comes on if the headlights are on!, normal
just like other cars.

>5. I would like to lower the car so that the tires are almost flush
with
>the fenders.  Is this an easy task on a 911?  It would seem to me that
all
>one has to do is change the alignment of the torsion bar... anything I
>should know (the car has bilstiens)

I know that Porsche in '83 started to set the EURO ride height on the
north america cars, earlier they were much higher. The reason for the
change was that the bumber rules changed. I have no experience in
lowering it lower than euro height, but I could imagine you would get
into problems when turning the front wheels. They might scrape on the
inside of the wheel weel. ? Handling wise? there is race guys on this
list who knows much more than I.

>6. What is the fan that is in front of the spare tire and next to the
>battery in the very front of the car.  It doesn't seem to work.

I believe its a fan for the condenser mounted just underneath. My hunch
is that it only is on if the AIR is on, haven't really checked mine.
