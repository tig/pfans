<I'm not sure what you mean by "the gauge in the clock", but I
     <suspect that you're talking about the oil-level gauge. =20

If its the oil level in the same clock as the fuel guage, it just sits =
at the bottom which is in the red, when I check the dipstick=20
there doesnt seem to be enough oil there, time to top up the oil , yes? =
Any idea if its normal for the level to go down over a few months,=20
does engine oil get burnt up or something? Thanks for the last reply.

    Andrew:

    Oil temperature should be 180 degrees F, oil pressure should read
    10-15 psi per 1000 RPM.

    I'm not sure what you mean by "the gauge in the clock", but I
    suspect that you're talking about the oil-level gauge.  If it's
    ever accurate, it'll be when the oil is warm and the car's
    idling, parked on a level surface.

    Yes.  911s use a dry-sump oil system, so dipstick measurements
    are only accurate when the engine is running.  Make sure that
    the oil is warm and the car is parked on a level surface, too.
