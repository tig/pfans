Hi David.  I mounted an amp underneath the passenger seat.  I mounted the amp
to a 1/4" piece of plywood.  I mounted the plywood with L brackets to the
metal "tubes" the seat rails sit on.  So there were no holes through the floor
and the amp is very solid.

Later I added 2 subs in a box which I did end up mounting through the floor. 
If I had known I was going to add the subs when I mounted the amp, I could
have made the plywood I mounted the amp on long enough (the sub box fits on
the floor area behind the front seats) that I would have been able to mount
the box to the same piece of wood the amp is on.  The same could be done on
the driver side to eliminate the need to mount it to the floor.

I've got a picture of the amp (although it's hard to see the wood and the
brackets) if you want it.
