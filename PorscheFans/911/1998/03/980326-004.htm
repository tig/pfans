Hi All,

I've been a lurker on this list for months trying to gather up facts before
I start shopping around for a used porsche. I'm looking for a car that is
will be a daily driver. Up to now I've had my eye on 964 C2's (maybe a '93 to
get all the factory fixes for the various engine problems). I like the 964
styling and I'm thinking that a targa top might be fun as well.

So anyhow, I was talking to an acquaintance who hag a '95 993 C2 which 
recently was stolen in NY and he told me that new multilink rear suspension
on the 993 had *greatly* reduced the tail happy tendencies of the 911. (Kind
of ironic for him to say this since after 2 months of onwership he spun out
and went flying backwards in to a wall at 30mph. If I recall it was around 
$35,000 worth of damange). Maid it sound like a night and day improvement.

Pluswith all the other improvements (6 speed, styling etc), he thought that I
would forever regret not getting a 993, especially for a daily driver.

This advice is quite nice, but if I got into a '95 993, I would be so over
budget it isn't even funny. I'm not sure how I'd even broach this with the
SO :-). It most likely would push back my purchase for a while.

Any opinions on this? Is the handling that dramatically better on the 993 
than the 964? Any other reasons why I should stay away from a 964 and try
to scrounge my way into a 993?

I greatly appreciate any insight on this subject.

TIA,

-Eric
