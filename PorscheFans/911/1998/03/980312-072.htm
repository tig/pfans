Howdy Pfans -

A while back I reported installing a leaky oil return tube.  After reading
several postings about a bad batch of tubes, I contacted Automotion.
They didn't acknowledge receiving any "bad" tubes, but were happy
to exchange mine.  I decided to take a chance and had them send
me an entire set, since by this time the other three original tubes
had begun to leak as well.

I'm happy to report that the new tubes Automotion sold are leak free.
They're VERY tight.  So tight in fact that it was a struggle to install
them.  Scratched them up with my pliers a bit in the process.  Now
I understand the postings about difficulty getting the tubes fully
extended and the lock ring seated.

Also, thanks to the fan (Harley?) who suggested bending a nail to
use as a tool to hold the circlip open.  Worked great!

Cheers,

- Brad
