I've got the engine out, mainly to clean up the engine compartment prior to
paint.
Question is, as long as it's out, what should I check for? It has only 2400
miles on it, but was in storage for 12 years.  Purchase deal was that engine
would be in operable/running condition, which it is.  However, I don't trust
the seller (Brian Doherty/ California Porsche Restoration, Main Street Auto in
Fallbrook, CA) as far as I would LOVE to throw him!!!  Will do a leakdown, but
anything else you folks would recommend?
My plan was to tear down and detail, but since its spring in Chgo., I figure
I'll do that this Winter so I can drive it for now.

TIA
