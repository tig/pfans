This is in response to Al Cabrera's question about brake pad changes:

Al:  I changed my pads on my '87 carrera for the first time a couple of weeks
ago and it was pretty easy. I started with the front wheels(no real reason)
and the general procedure once you have the tires off is as follows:

Take a small punch(a nail will do in a pinch) and push the two pins that hold
the spring retaining clip off. You're pushing the pins from the outboard side
of the caliper to the inside. When you get the first pin done the spring
retainer will spring up. Not a problem. Push the other pin out. The pads
should come out now. Just reach in and pull them out. 

At this point the pistons in the caliper should have been extended. You'll
need to push them back into the caliper to make clearance for the new thicker
pads so what I've done in the past is to slip part of the old brake pad
between the caliper piston and the rotor and leave the other end of the pad
exposed. Now with one end of either a large c-clamp or a large pair of pliers
grab the extended end of the old pad then grab the outside edge of the caliper
with the other end of the c-clamp and squeeze. What you're doing is pushing
the piston back into the caliper housing to make room for the new pad.  Once
that's done you can pop the new pads in easily. You'll also want to reinstall
the brake pad wear sensor into it's slot on the pad before installing the pad
if possible. The sensor has a retaining clip that needs to stay on and it can
be awkward if your fingers are big. 

Once the pads are in position then reinstall the spring retaining clip with
the first  pin. Just tap the pin back into the caliper and make sure you push
the pin all the way back in. If you can see the end of the pin head on the
outboard side of the caliper then you did it right. You'll have to hold the
end of the spring clip down while you're tapping in the second pin. Once the
second pin is in you're done. 

That's essentially all there is to it. Now's also the time to check your brake
fluid and change it if necessary. 

Good Luck
