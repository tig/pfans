I use 36 front, 44 rear (this is what's in my owner's manual) - I've
got a '90 C2... I'm not sure if the C4 specifies different pressures
or not. I've currently got 205/55-16 front and 245/45-16 rear, soon to
be swapped for 17 inch wheels - sizes as yet undecided!

There is a kit that you can retrofit to your distributor that will vent
the distributor with air from the main cooling blower. The kit is cheap,
installation is easy. You can have a shop do it - it probably would not
take them more than 1/2 hour of shop time.

It used to be that you could not just buy the belts - I believe the
justification for this was that belts had to be matched to the distributors
and aligned extremely carefully - you could only buy rebuilt distributors
for something around $750 or $1000 or so. I have recently seen belts
advertised, though.

I bought my car in August with 40,000 miles on it, and I had the vent kit
installed at the same time. I check periodically to see that the driven
half of the distributor is operating properly (I pull the cap and make sure
it doesn't rotate easily when I try twisting the rotor). No problems so
far at 45,000 miles.

Someone else recently reported that the big [!] warning indicator went on
in his car, and after some sleuthing he discovered that the belt had
broken. I *don't* know if the indicator will always come on if the belt
breaks - I suspect NOT, so I check.

Cheers,

Ross
