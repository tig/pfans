Ernie, the sensors all have to work (i.e., no short across them) in order for
the lfgiht to go out.  On my  old'84, I could NEVER successfully transfer
sensors from one pad to another; always broke them.  Since I was changing
pads back & forth between track and street compounds prob. 4-7 times
a year, figured the wear sensors were superfluous.  Eliminated them by 
taking an old wear sensor unit and cutting the sensor off near the plug-in 
connector, stripping and wrapping the two ends together by the plug, and 
reinstalling just the plug back in place.  No stupid idiot light, and easier
pad replacement!

Hi Fans:
Thanks for all the good advice on adjusting valves.
First question is regarding brake pad wear lights. I recently changed F&R
brake pads after the brake pad dash indicator came on. Trouble is, the light's
still on after I changed them. What's up? Do the wear indicators also go bad
and have to be replaced?

Second question is regarding the oil additives that bilstein and lubromoly
sell. Does anyone have experience using them and would/should you use them
even if you're using sythetic oil now?  Seems like overkill to me.

Lastly. Thanks for all the notes on K&N filters. I've had one for over two
years and am thinking about switching back to paper. A buddy showed me a paper
last year that was written based on a study of motocross motorcycles that
showed much greater cylinder wear  with bikes that used K&N filters.

best regards,

Ernie
