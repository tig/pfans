I have a 1988 white Carrera, wondering if anyone has tried the Magbra
magnetic ... well, bra. I see it's available in white, anyone seen it on a
white 911? Is it ugly? Anyone tried or recommend Stongard?

Had a factory bra on my 80 silver Targa, but it fogged the paint. However,
the PO had had the car painted, and it was not a great job, had a tendency
to chip if you breathed on it. How does a factory paint job hold up to a
conventional bra, and is it neccesary to remove the bra if the car has a
chance of getting wet? Rains all summer down here in Florida. What about
scratching?

Thanks for all the input
Vic
