> I'm new to autox and driver's ed events and interested in comments from

> Phase 1: My C4S has the factory Euro lowering springs which I've found to
> be a definite improvement over the stock U.S. springs, as far as handling
> and looks are concerned.
> 
> Phase 2: I am considering installing the factory Super Cup adjustable sway
> bars, and then depending on how this setup feels on the track installing
> the Porsche M30 (RSR?) dampers and springs. Has anyone else gone this
> route? Does this seem like a logical progression? I like the idea of the
> M30 because it was designed as a package and it's original Porsche parts
> (or at least factory authorized). Or is this just a newbie notion that I
> should discard for an even better third-party solution? For example, H&R
> looks like they have a very well thought out and designed spring/damper
> system. At some point I will also be investing in a second set of wheels
> and R compound tires.

> Thank you for your ideas on this.
