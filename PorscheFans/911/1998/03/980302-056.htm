LISTEN JERK! IF I MADE A MISTAKE BECAUSE I AM NOT A CAR EXPERT WELL SO WHAT.
YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A JERK ABOUT IT. THE PORSCHE FANS IS NOT A FORUM TO WORK
OUT A MISTAKE! ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS EMAIL ME! I DONT CAR ABOUT $23.00 ENOUGH
TO STEAL IT. I'M A HAD WORKING HONEST FELLOW WHO DOES NOT NEED TO GET OVER ON
ANYONE! AND AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU DID CALL ME AND I DID SPEAK TO YOU ON THE
PHONE . SO YOU STAND CORRECTED! IF YOU SENT ME AN EMAIL TELLING ME WHAT
HAPPENED AND THAT WE NEED TO FIX IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. YOU CERTAINLY CAN GET
IN TOUCH WITH ME SINCE I'M REPLIING.
SINCE YOU MADE IT A PUBLIC ISSUE I'M REPLING IN PUBLIC. IF YOU WANT TO FIX THE
MISTAKE I MADE FIRST FIX THE MISTAKE YOU MADE BY ACTING LIKE A CHILD.
EMAIL ME WITH THE PROBLEM AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO!
JUST DO IT LIKE A MATURE ADULT.
