Hi, Justin
and Porsche Fans

Well your in luck as I used to own a car audio store and installed many =
radios myself in all kinds of cars.  I may not know what the colors mean =
in you particular model but I can tell you how to find out. =20

Get a test light at the hardware store and a 9 volt battery,

cut some of the shielding off each wire coming out of your dashboard. so =
that  the bare copper is exposed on the ends.
(carefull not to cross any of the wires)

Keep your ignition key in off position and ground your test light with =
the clamp (bare metal on the body of the car i.e. screws hinge etc).  =
Touch each wire with the pointed end until the test light goes on.  Keep =
the contact and turn on your lights if the light goes off this is your =
radio dimmer lead.  If the light stays on then it is your constant power =
(always has 12v in ignition on or off position)

Next repeat the process with your ignition in the on position.
The one that lights up and stays on when you try your lights is the =
switched ignition lead.  (turns radio on or off when the key is turned)

Next you must clamp the test light to your constant power lead that you =
found earlier and start tapping the other wires with the pointed end.  =
When the light goes on you found your ground
Don't forget to try the lights again if the test light goes off the it's =
not a ground wire.

Mark all the previous wires with tape or other method you may prefer

Now for the speakers

Take the 9 volt battery and attach one of the left over wires.  Then =
proceed to tap each of the left over wires to the other contact of the =
battery.  Once you hear an audible pop from the a speaker you have found =
the leads for that particular speaker.  Disconnect the wires and label =
them accordingly.  The darker wire is usually the negative side.  repeat =
this with the rest of the wires untill you have all your speakers =
designated. =20

Once this is done all that is left to do is splice the wires with the =
radio wires and install the radio=20

(Make sure to test before reassembling your dash, as it is a real pain =
to have to pull you dash apart to fix a mixed up wire)

If you have a power antenna the (usually) Blue wire from the radio must =
be attached to you power antenna lead from your dash (found by running =
constant 12v power to the lead.  the antenna will rise)  =20

The only concern you might have is that Porsche and Volkswagen don't =
supply a switched ignition lead to the radio.  Only constant power.  I =
am not sure if the 944 has this same detail.  If it does just attach =
your constant power and switched power wires from your radio together =
and attach to the constant power from your dash.  This will run the =
radio even when the car is off and you would have to manully turn the =
radio off when shutting the car down.

I hope this was a help.  I'm posting this on the P-fans newletters for =
everyone else to refer to if they have any questions

Thanks
