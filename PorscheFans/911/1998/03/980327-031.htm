<<<...A family member talked to a german car mechanic at out church and 
asked about a 911, since I have been talking about getting one for ages, 
and the mechanics response was that they were fairly high maintenance 
cars...snip......I want a good idea, as I am NOT going to be cheap about 
maintenance on the car. If anyone cares to share your experiences, I would 
like to hear them, so I will have a better idea as to what I am up against. 
 Thanks
in advance,....>>>

Jeremy,

He's right, 911 ownership can be very expensive.  The previous owner of my 
car spent over 20k on repairs to my SC and that was in a 2.5 year period of 
time.  Since I've owned the car (December of '96) I've spent roughly 4k on 
it between maintenance and minor changes to the car.  If you'd like a list 
of what had been done to my car I can send it to you.  Keep in mind that 
the repairs my previous owner did were all "Maintenance Repairs," not 
speedracer upgrades.

Bit of History...I purchased my car with 74k miles on it and it is an 82 
SC.  I now have 109k miles on it (I drive it alot) and all in all I'm 
pretty happy with it.

I could be the exception and not the norm so wait and see what others have 
spent on their cars to get a good idea of what you could be in for.

For more detail drop me a note...

Eric Myers
