Hello,

I am attempting to replace the belt inside the distributor on my 90 C4. =
I have the distributor taken apart in the garage. I took the distributor =
out of the car, took the caps out, unclip the plug for the timing wires, =
unscrew the flat head screw in the center of the shaft, unclip the =
springs and pull the guts out of the housing. I took the 5 hex screws =
that hold the belt housing to the rest of the distributor out and I=92m =
stuck at this point.

The belt housing still won=92t come out because something is still =
holding the shaft. I think this is when experience kicks in and solve =
the problem.

Has anyone done this before?

What am I missing?

P l e a s e H e l p !

Luis
