I have one, so I know there is one out there? Is this something that
someone took off and should be replaced or was it a performance
option?

This car handles a bit piggish...>

My '69 911 originally had no sway bars and it handled like a piglet.  At that
time I wondered why Porsches had this so-called reputation. However, adding
sway bars made a world of difference. As Bill Betts relates, if your car
originally had a rear bar, you should have the sway bar mounts welded to the
body, just above the torsion bar tube. If your car originally had none, you
can purchase the mounts (early or updated mounts), then have them welded in
place.

BTW, if you're interested, I have an original front (16mm) and rear bar (15mm)
set with hardware FS; I'd like $75 per + shipping.
