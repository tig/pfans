Hey,

Yesterday at the track I had some problems with my
915 gearbox and thought I would solicit some opinions
before I start looking into what the problem may be.

The problem began as a difficulty shifting from 3rd to
4th - it just wouldn't go into gear.  After 2 or 3 laps of
not being able to shift into 4th, I gave up and came into
the pits.  When I attempted to back into my pit spot, I
couldn't get reverse...or 3rd, 4th or 5th.  I only had first
an second.  I had to go instruct at this point so I just
pulled the car out of the pit area and left it (wondering
how long it was going to take me to travel 150 miles
or so home in 2nd gear...) :>0

The shifter would shift in and out of 1st and 2nd
normally, but would not move to the right at all to
engage 3rd, 4th, 5th or reverse.

After I finished instructing, I loaded up the car and
prepared to inspect the linkages, etc.  Before I started
taking things apart I thought I would try it again.  Low and
behold, everything was fine.  The drive home was
un-eventful.  The car shifted just as well as it ever had.

Any ideas?  I suspect that maybe a bushing in the shift
linkage has deteriorated and jammed the linkage leading
to my shifting problem, but somehow cleared itself.

I haven't had time to take a look yet.  Where should I
start?  BTW, I'm living on borrowed time, as my gearbox
has never been apart in its 22 years of existence.... :>))

TIA,
