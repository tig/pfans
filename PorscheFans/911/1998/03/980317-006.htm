Todd:

I have had Yoko AVS Intermediates on my '95 993 since early last Summer
and have been happy with them. They are a good street tire and for the
times when I've gotten caught in the rain :>( they were much better than
the Continental Sport Contacts which came with the car. Can't offer an
opinion for the other Yokos. Good luck!

Subject: Street Tires

I am looking to purchase some street tires for my 1972 911.
I have narrowed the tire type down to the Yokohama tires, the AVS
Intermediates,
A008P, or the A509.

The A509 is a good inexpensive tire, but what about the other two?

Is the A008P a good tire?  I have heard that it is not all that special,

it looks like it has some of the popular 911 tire sizes.  Is there
anything
specific about the tire that would make it a good one?

How does the AVS Intermediate compare to the A008P?

Has anyone with a 1972 911 put 215/60-15 tires on 6x15 or even 7x15
rims,
on the rear of the car, does this tire size fit?  Or does the tire rub
the fender?

Todd
