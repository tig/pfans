Here's my input....

I've taken a few automotive classes, and we've discussed such matters as
cooling in "water-cooled" and "air-cooled" engines.  Their names are indeed
misnomers.

In a "water-cooled" engine, only about a 1/3rd of the heat is dissipated
through the "water" (ie., coolant), by way of the radiator.  Another 1/3rd is
dissipated through the oil, and the final 3rd is dissipated radiantly, or
through the air (ie., the heat coming from the engine, exhaust, etc...)

In an "air-cooled" engine, you don't have the coolant.  So, about half is
dissipated through the air, and about half through the oil.

Of course, these are really broad statements. ...It is logical to assume that,
since Porsche's air-cooled engines take such a large quantity of oil (12 qts),
an even greater percentage is dissipated through the oil.

For what it's worth......

Dave
