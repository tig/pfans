You are correct that the sensor is a plastic insert into a notch
on the brake pad.  You're also correct that the plastic wears away
and exposes the wire which undoubtedly makes contact with the brake
disk.

I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I had the circuitry
correct.  The sensor has a two pronged plug and two wires down
to the plastic tab.  Inside the plastic tab, the wire is just a
connected loop (I saw one of mine when it was partially worn
away).

Now, you can think of the circuit as a continuous loop of wire
from start (where ever), serially through each brake sensor (all
four wheels), and back.  And the logic checks for continuity
through the sensor circuit.  If any one sensor is missing, or
broken, continuity is broken.  It's possible that initial exposure
and contact to the brake disk will ground it and trigger the light.
But, if the wire is worn all the way through, it will definitely
break the continuity and trigger the light.

When I did my first brake pad replacement, I did this (I didn't
want to spend the $12/sensor.  They are cheaper now.)  So, I
snipped the plastic tab off, soldered the ends together, taped
them up and tucked them away.

I don't do that anymore.  Many places sell the sensors for
$6, and that falls within my price point :-)
