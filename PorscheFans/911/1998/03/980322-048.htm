To the contrary, synthetics are especially well suited to air-cooled (or oil
cooled) engines for their heat dissipating properties. I couldn't stand it
anymore and dug out a copy of an article from Motor Trend from 1993
(Technologue by Ron Grable - Synthetic oils - a revolution is brewing). The
following are a couple of relevant paragraphs from the article:

"One major advantage of a synthetic oil is it's ability to function at higher
temperatures than a petroleum-based product. Mobil once ran a commercial
showing side-by-side frying pans cooking a regular oil and Mobil 1. The
regular oil turns into a brown sludge, while Mobil 1 looks unchanged, which is
a reasonable depiction of the truth. Above 475 degrees F, conventional oils
will volatilize rapidly, forming varnish, tar, and sludge, decreasing ability
to libricate. Synthetics on the other hand, still can provide lubrication up
to 700 degrees F. A good synthetic oil like Red Line, will lose only about
four percent of its weight when tested at 400 degrees for six hours; a
conventional oil will boil away as much as 30 percent. This termperature
stability is important because the upper cylinder area normally operates in
the 600-degree range, and the pistons rings around 400. In addtion to their
superior heat resistance, synthetics offer much higher film strenghths than do
conventional oils. Film strength is the resistance an oil offers to being
squeezed out of a bearing. In such tests, a petroleum oil will measure around
500psi, while a good synthetic is 3000 psi, a significant advantage in terms
of overall lubrication. At elevated temperatures, conventional oils bead up,
while synthetics wet the surface, exhibiting a high affinity for the hot
metal. This better contact increases heat transfer into the oil, reducing the
temperature of metal parts. It also allows the oil to get rid of the heat to
the cooling medium. Synthetic oils also run cooler because they have superior
friction characteristics-they're slipperier than petroleum oils."

Tolerance to high temps, greater film strength, less evaporative loss, greater
affinity to hot metal. Compelling reasons for synthetic oil.

I hope this helps.
