Hi Pfans,
    Am shopping for a 911 Targa here in California.  There seem to be
plenty of them here.  Among the ones that are in my price range are an
'84 gray market car, owned by a military person and thus never before
registered in Calif.  He sez and his mechanic sez, no problem.  My
question regarding this car is, how much, if any, discount/premium goes
with his Eurospec car, also are there any significant differences other
than the motor?
    Another candidate car is an SC with about 70,000 miles, lot of
recent service records, but the car has a salvage title.  My personal
experience with salvaged cars is, if the repairs are done correctly,
there is no problem, however, the cars are bought and sold at about 20%
discount from <normal> prices.  Would that be about right for Porsches? 
Of course, some people will simply not buy a car with a salvage title,
hence the discount.
    A third car is a '71 911S which has had a fiberglass slantnose
conversion.  Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance yet to inspect the
car.  Greg Skalla, of this list, was kind enough to post me an extremely
comprehensive letter on the mechanicals and desireability of his S.  Any
opinions on the value of the slantnose conversion?
     I'm not sure if the responses to these questions will be of
interest to the 911 list in general, so if anyone prefers, email your
answers to me directly at edq882@ix.netcom.com.
     Many TIA's, Ed
