I just had my 91 C2's 30K maintenance done and now I have a problem 
that I did not have before I took it in to my wrench.  Whenever I stop 
at a light the idle goes to 1000 rpm for a moment like it should, then 
drops to about 200 rpm and corrects itself up to 800 for a second and 
levels off at 1000rpm and idles fine. This happens every time I stop 
at a light or an off ramp.  The wrench did all the usual things, 
plugs, valve adjustment, filters, transmission service, etc. and the 
car runs fine at speed and driving around town.  The car has a 
tiptronic transmission.  Also, when I move the shifter from park to 
reverse it pauses a moment before the car moves.  It is like the rpm 
is not high enough to engage the transmission.  Very strange because 
the problem did not exist before.

My wrench will fix the problems but I thought I might be able to get 
some advice to help him.  Demonstrate the power of the internet and 
Pfans!

Thank you for your help.
