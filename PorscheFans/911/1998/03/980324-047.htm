There are two seperate tickets. First is the General entrance (Enceinte
Generale). Last year's price was 320 FF (about $50). That gets you into
the main gate and standing room. Much of the spectator area along the
main straight is actually standing, and it's packed. There are also some
other entrance tickets that limit you to certain other sections of the
track (Mulsanne, Arnage, etc.). If you want a grandstand seat, they range
from about 190-470 FF depending on the location. Many of the better seats
will be sold out already.


The bigger difficulty may be getting a place to stay unless you want to
rough it with the Brits. There are many camping areas all around the
southern half of the track and the fees are quite low. 


Be sure you are there if possible on Thursday. The general admission
ticket gets you into the pits all day and quite close to the cars and
drivers. There is also lots of practice also. On Friday not much goes on
at the track, although there are many events in the city itself including
the driver's parade and a vintage car show. The whole area is into the
race and it's a great international spectacle.


Make sure you check out some of the excellent web pages:

My wife and I had a great time last year staying with a French family
only 1/2 mile from the main entrance. You may still be able to find
accomodation at a home by calling the LeMans Tourist Office.


Good luck!

<excerpt>Does anybody have experience with attending the 24 Hours of Le
Mans? I will be in Europe during the time of the race, but do not know
how to get tickets and what ticket to get (grandstand, pits, etc.).


If anyone has experience, please send me some clues!


Thank
