I think the main reason why US 993s ride higher than Euro 993s is due to
US bumper height laws, just like on the BMW M3s.  You can order the
factory Euro shocks and springs here if you want to.  Several people
have complained that the euro springs don't install properly w/ US
shocks, leaving a "gap" between the spring and perch in the rear. 
Eibach and H&R springs have no problem fitting onto US shocks.  I will
be uploading pictures on the web of a friend's 993 w/ Eibach springs and
and my 993 w/ H&R springs in a few weeks.  I'll post the web address
once it's done.

Now, I have a stupid question about all the threads on Euro vs US ride
heights on 993's.  OK, let's assume (correctly, I believe) that the Euro
993's are set up to ride lower.  If that's the case, why can't you just
order the EXACT shocks and springs from Porsche as they use in Europe? 
At
the very least, if they won't sell the items to US customers for fear of
being sued by someone, surely you could get a buddy in Europe to order
them
for you and send them over.  I can't understand all the "after market"
questions about this.  Why can't you just get the same set up via
Porsche.
Am I missing something here?  Is there something they do to the Euro
cars
vs US cars other than different shocks and springs?  Just curious.
