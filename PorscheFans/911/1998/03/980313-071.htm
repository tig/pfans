Mike, I'd normally say buy a shop manual and read it, but on reviewing
mine, it doesn't cover getting at the lamp.  However, there is a Tech Bulletin
on converting an early 993 to the top-mounted brake light unit (Group 6, no.
9603).  Reading this, looks like the painted cover pries out, then there 
is a long mounting strip held in place with two nuts.  Unscrew this, and
you can then unscrew the lamp unit from underneath the strip.

You might be SOL on the bulb replacement; neither Tech Bulletin or parts
microfiche describe any individual lamp replacement.  Pictures show 
brake light unit as an (apparent) sealed unit.

If you are under warranty, I would say bring the sucker to the dealer and let
him play with it.  If he breaks anything, you still get a free repair; if it
looks
like you monkeyed with it, he might not honor the warranty.

Hi,

    I've got a 97 993 that has one of the small brake bulbs in the rear
window fixture out. This is located in the upper part of the rear
window. The manual says; since these bulbs are soldered in you should
have the dealer replace the bulb. I would consider replacing the bulb
myself as the dealer replacement will most likely take close to two
hours with my driving time to and from the dealer. I'm an EE so
soldering doesn't bother me, but not being an ME does; I don't know
what's involved in getting to the defective bulb. Could someone let me
know how difficult this is.


Thanks for the help,
