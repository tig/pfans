I received a similar postcard for Europroduct's chip for a 944 Porsche. 
The 944 chip, as advertised, was even lower at $139.00!!  This was
enough of a decrease compared to the usual $200-$350 normally advertised
to entice me to try it out.  I bought it.  It came with good
instructions - easy installation.  The difference is definetly
noticeable in my 1987 8-valve standard 944, but is not amazing.  I hoped
for a more flexible, torquey engine.  I am pleased, if not dazzled with
the results.  It definetly adds more top end power, but hasn't increased
the flexibility of my engine all that much, in my opinion.  I feel it
was a worth the money.  I'd love to hear from other Porsche people about
their experience with Europroduct's chip and how they feel it compares
to the competition.  Is this a good chip?  It has made a "seat of the
pants" difference in my otherwise "stock" 944.
