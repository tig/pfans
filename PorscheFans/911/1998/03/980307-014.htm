Kevin:

You can try by calling the Porsche Club of America office at 703-922-9300
eastern standard time Monday thru Friday.  They take credit cards.  I don't
know if they sell to non-members or not.  They have a deal on the first 9
issues with index (a separate item) for $118 plus shipping.  Volume 10, just
out, is $18, plus shipping, more.  They might be able to tell you what the
overseas shipping is.  They are very handy and good reading, but not something
you couldn't live without.  Issues are also priced individually, ranging from
$12 to 18 each.  If you have a Carrera (1984 or later car), you might forget
volumes 7 and earlier and just get 8-10 which are $18 each, plus shipping.
