I've been watching everyday for the past 3 weeks
my odometer climb slowly towards that Magical 100000 mile mark
anticipating with much interest at the possibility of going
100 MPH at the exact moment that the odometer rolls over.
It's supposed to be bliss, i'm told....
I know pretty shallow however i'm led to believe that something
short of an outta body experiece will happen. 
Well, yesterday while sitting in traffic after a very bad in
the office, i look down to see, yup you guessed it 100002 miles.
Crap, $#!^ mother of all that is bad,,, etc. etc. etc.
I look over at the guy sitting next to me on the freeway as he watches
me throw this fit and wonder what he's thinking......
Can someone please console me a little as I now have to look at this 
odometer everyday!!!!!
