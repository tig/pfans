To Rick and John:


I would certainly agree with Mike D. about doing any grinding on torsion
bars.
Sometimes you do see those rub marks but that usually doesn't cause a
failure. As long as you do not remove any metal from the surface of the
bar, you should be just fine. Merely paint the exposed metal to prevent
a corrosion related failure.

If you have ground on that torsion bar, you should discard that one and
get another used one from the same side. They are stamped on the end
with the side that they are installed in.

There are soft-durometer bushings available that will aleviate the
rubbing problem without the penalties of hard race-type bushings. When
polyurethane bushings are prepared and installed properly, they will not
squeak!
We have several cars, including my own, that we installed polyurethane
bushings in 1979, that work just great and make no noise whatsoever.
Its all in the surface preparation, fitment, and lubricant choice.

Hope this helps,...............
