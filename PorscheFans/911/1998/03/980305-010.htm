Eric,
I had similar problems (remember the car is 18 years old :-).  It turned
out that I had a cracked vacuum diaphragm in the distributor.  Once this
was replaced, all was well again.  Detonation is primarily a timing issue,
so look at the advance system closely.  There is a good chance the problem
is there.
