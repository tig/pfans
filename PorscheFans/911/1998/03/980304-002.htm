	I bought a Solo cordless detector for my car when I got it in
January. I can't say that I'm very impressed with the detector.  I'm not
having any problems with the batteries falling out, but it seems like the
thing doesn't really catch very many radars and I get false alarms all the
time.  Sometimes I get false alarms at predictably at the same spots,
indicating some sort of transmitter nearby, but what really distresses me
is twice now I've actually been gunned by police radar and the Solo failed
to pick them up until I was literally about 15' away from the police car.
It really shattered my confidence in the detector when that happened.
