Hi Greg,

I had some squeaking like that not too long ago.  Fix for my '77 was new
ball joints (did both sides, about $300).  While in there, we also
replaced the sway bar bushings (labor included in above, parts $60).
Had CV joints checked and repacked as a preventive measure ($236; too
high?).

Regarding DIY, if it were me (automotive hardware neophyte), I would
want to see it done first, just like in med school: See one, do one,
teach one.

Hope this helps, and good luck.  That last 1% is always a pain...
