Hi Bill,
I live in a Mpls suburb and am active in the local Porsche Club, Nord
Stern.  The club numbers in excess of 500 people (I believe) and has quite
an array of track, autocross, concours, social and technical events every
year.  We are also fortunate to have our own local track, Brainerd
International Raceway, located about 2 hrs. north of the cities.  It is
located in a wonderful resort area so if the family is not track inclined,
there are plenty of activities that are outside the track arena.
We have two Porsche dealerships and at least a half dozen excellent private
p-wrenches with street and race prep facilities.
Since I am an admitted track junkie I am most comfortable with the track
event schedule and operation.  We hold 4 events at BIR each season and one
at Road America.  We also usually have a common event with the Milwaukee
club at Blackhawk Farms Raceway.  In addition we run two autocross events
as well during the season.  There is a large Club Race contingent that
regularly attends out of region races as well as our own club race that is
now celebrating its 6th running (this year - hope my memory is correct on
this - believe we started in 93).  We also are lucky to have a large group
of dedicated driving instructors that typically hold at least two driving
instruction schools every year.

Now on the down side you only drive your p-car 6-7 months out of the year
unless you are a real die-hard, and we do have a few of them :).  The good
side to this is that you get a wonderful opportunity to do all the things
you never get around to doing when you drive the car year round (how's that
for optimism!).

I'm sure I have left out many things that others can fill in for me.  I
know a number of us "locals" are on this list.
Jon (VERY close to pulling the car out for the season - you betcha :)
