Pfans:

I have edited some previous list discussions on aircraft applications of
Porsche engines with contributions from Tom Thompson and Bruce Anderson.

Due to the escalating cost of aircraft engines, experimental aircraft home
builders have been turning to auto engine conversions. The Tailwind Times, a
newsletter for the home builders and flyers of Wittman Tailwinds, has
recently reported on Ivan Andersson's Porsche powered Tailwind. Pictures
reveal a slightly extended engine cowling and a three bladed prop. This
airplane can fly at better than 180 mph true airspeed and rates of climb
over 1000 fpm at gross weight. Dynamometer tests showed 150 hp at 5000 rpm.
Engine weight with reduction drive is approximately 300 pounds. A reduction
drive is necessary to reduce prop speed so that the prop tip does not exceed
the speed of sound. For more information, call Ivan at home 760-246-8623 or
at Bancroft Motor Sport 714-540-7923.


Porsche actually produced a certificatedaircraft engine for several years in
the '80s. The 3.2 litre unit was rated at 200 HP at 5000 RPM. Mooney
Aircraft produced the Mooney PFM with this engine, and  several aftermarket
shops offered conversions for Cessna 172s. It was geared down 2:1 to reduce
prop tip speed.

Mods for aircraft application included complete dual ignition and fuel
injection systems (inclduing the CIS injection, wiring harness and
A/C batteries, not just twin nozzles and plugs). The key advantage was
single-lever power operation (no mixture control) and a much smoother
engine feel.

The product was killed due to slow sales caused by the high price ($27,500
for conversion, and a $15-20k add-on to the Mooney's base price). I think
that PFM parts are still available from Porsche, however.

It's true that the Porsche powered Mooney was not a commercial success,
deterred by the cost/benefit ratio. One innovation in that plane was in
incorporation of a single power control instead of several now in common
use. History is littered with terrific innovation that failed due to lack of
political clout. The use of Porsche engines in home built aircraft will not
likely represent a significant fraction of the market, but the aviation
industry started and has continually been impacted by experimental builders
operating out of their garages, etc. An exciting aspect of technological
evolution is innovative experimentation driving a developmental curve whose
outcome is difficult to predict (the Porsche spirit).  Let's light those
imaginative fires!

Due to product liability, most high performance personel aircraft are
"experimental" and are built in owners garages, apartments, etc. The home
builders culture is similar to the culture based on Porsche cars. Likewise,
aircraft homebuilders are constantly adjusting to price/benefit. As the
price of conventional aircraft engines rise, the $10K turn-key price of
Porsche engine conversion will be more commercially viabable. If you look at
the Continental and Lycoming aircraft engines of the 1940's, you would be
struck by the similarities in layout between them and 911 engines. An
enterprising aircraft home builder would certainly consider purchasing an
inexpensive Porsche engine and rebuild it for use in her airplane if
conversions are cost effective. I personally only advocate for an increase
in options and innovative advancement, not the specifics of applying Porsche
engines to aircraft. That I only report.
