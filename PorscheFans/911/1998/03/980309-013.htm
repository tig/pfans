Hello, folks:

I am the proud new owner of a 1988 Carrera Targa, GP White, black
leather, 23,000 miles. The car is as new, hardly any dirt, no dings,
cared for with love.

The PO used Zymol Creame, Zymol HD Cleanse on the paint, Lexol on
leather, and Zymol Vinyl on the interior; something called Black Again
on the rubber trim outside. It worked, apparently.

I am seeking recommendations on how to care for this 10-year-old paint.
The PO used the HD Cleanse every time he waxed, but the car was only
driven perhaps 1,000 miles a year. I don't want to strip the paint that
often. Advice? How often to wax? Stick with the Zymol? The car lives in
Florida.

The only signs of age the finish shows are some faint cracks in the
bottom of the "gutter" where the windshield meets the hood, where the
rain would run down.

Also, what do you folks use to clean the wheel wells and engine
compartment? They are practically spotless now, but I am using the car
as a daily driver (which it will love, I'm sure) and expect to get it
dirty. Wheels are 16" Fuchs with white centers; I've always used P21S on
my previous older 911s. But should the centers be waxed with Zymol or
something stronger?

Thanks
Vic
