Hi there -

I'm soliciting some advice re. my '70 911E Targa.

I've owned the car for eight years and still love it.  It is a solid, 
well-running, original So. California car; however, the paint is in sorry 
condition and there are a couple minor dings/dents and small rust bubbles. 


Last summer I was pondering a comprehensive bare-metal body/paint 
restoration and then it "clicked" that I would be putting another $6-7K 
into a car worth maybe $6K as is, and afterwards it would still only be 
worth $7-8K even with pristine body and paint.  (Instead I put the money 
into a new car, a '97 M3 - no flames please)

This 911 is clearly on the "regularly driven / street" end of the scale and 
is not, and never will be a garage queen.  But, I can't bear to drive the 
car much longer with the crappy paint either!

Would I be totally nuts to do a more economical ding-fix and respray job on 
the car, enjoy driving it for a couple more years, and then sell it when 
I'm ready to (gulp) buy a house?  What kind of money should I expect to 
spend for a decent respray job?

Or should I dump the car now...painful as that would be...and likely be 
Porsche-less for several years...

Any advice and/or recommendations for reasonable body shops in the Los 
Angeles area would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply via direct email 
as well as to the digest.

Thanks a lot,
Chris Campbell
