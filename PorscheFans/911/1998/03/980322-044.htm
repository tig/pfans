What size rear wheels did the '94 C2TS have and how many were imported to
the US?  

Last weekend at a SCCA autocross, a young guy told me his father owns a
'94 Turbo S.  He said only 6 or so were imported into the US and that it
had 12 or 13 inch wide rear wheels.  I asked him if those were factory
stock and he said yes.  The car was bought new from a dealer for over 
$200k.  Initially, I thought that he was full of it, but after talking to
him for awhile, he seemed pretty knowledable.  Might the car he is talking
about be a C2TS?  Or any other ideas what it might be?

> Hi.  Here is the history about the C-2 Turbo S cars.
> 
> In 1992 Porsche had to beef-up the C-2 Turbo in order to be competitive in IMSA's Supercar Series and they homologated 20 C-2 Turbos with what they called the S2 package.  These cars were only available in the US.  Either Road and Track or Car and Driver featured one of these cars in 1992.  Cost was like 9 or 10 grand.  I have one of those cars with me in Puerto Rico.  The engine is a 3.3 liter with CIS injection system.  They look exactly like the C-2 Turbos but the turbine, camshafts and some other components are different.  Porsche claimed 320 HP for the cars; R&T or C&D said it was more like 380.  I was told by a Porsche official that they did not said that the car had 380 because they would have had to re-certify the cars for EPA.

> In 1993, Porsche sold in Europe a lightweight C-2 Turbo S in conmemoration of the C-2 Turbo S2s' that were winning in IMSA.  The engine was also a 3.3 liter w/ CIS and the engine modifications were the same as the American's S2.  Engine was rated @ 380 HP.  If you are interested, give me your fax and I will send the Porsche factory technoical brochure describing the car and all the part numbers for the parts that are different from the factory C-2 Turbo's.
> 
> In 1994 Porsche manufactured about 180 C-2Turbo S cars.  All of those cars had side vents in the quarter panels and most of had a slope nose.  The cars going to the Asian market had the 1987-1989 style slope nose and quarter panel air ducts.  The cars going to the US and ROW/except Asia had the 959 style air ducts.  The slope nose of these cars were similar to the 968s.  A few cars did not have the slope nose.  The engine was a 3.6 w/ motronic.  Porsche claimed 380 HP but I swear that it must have like 450 HP.  Excellence magazine featured this car in 1994.  The cover of the issue had a pearl white C-2 turbo S car.
