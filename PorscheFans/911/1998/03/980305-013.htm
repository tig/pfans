So I was standing in line at the grocery reading the tabloids...
and there was Jerry Seinfeld with his latest Porsche. The first 911
ever made. It's in really sad shape -- he paid $250,000 for it,
and is sending it to Porsche in Stuttgart to have it rebuilt from
the ground up...at a cost of $500,000.

So, that's $750,000...about 22 minutes work for him at his current
rate-per-show. Porsche will have to retool for several parts, which
is why the cost is so high. I wonder if Porsche will make available
several parts that haven't been around for a while for these older 911s.

Anyhow, the cool thing about all this is that Seinfeld wants to show
the car at the Concours in August at Monterey if it's done in time.
