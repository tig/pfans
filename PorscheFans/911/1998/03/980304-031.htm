Sometime in the mid-80's Porsche made an engine for Mooney Aircraft
based on the 911's DME-controlled motor.  The benefit of this design
over Lycoming's and Continental's was that the DME controlled the
mixture and propeller; the pilot only worried about the throttle, much
like an automobile with an automatic transmission.  In other small
aircraft, the pilot must set all three controls by reading a table for
the throttle and prop, and looking at cylinder head temperatures for the
mixture control.  Needless to say, the Mooney PFM, as it was called, was
much easier to fly.

Unfortunately, it was a very expensive airplane.  It was said that for
the price of a Porsche Mooney PFM, you could buy a Mooney 201 *and* a
Porsche 911!  Apparently, many pilots opted for the latter and Mooney
PFM production was canceled after a few years.
