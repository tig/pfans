     Subject: Changing 964 Sparkplugs
     To: Jad Duncan
     
     Well Jad you will not change the lower plugs quickly. I just went 
     through this with my 964. The easiest way to accomplish this is to 
     drop the exhaust system. Actually it is not as bad as it sounds, the 
     cat and two mufflers can be easilly dropped as an assembly. Use a 
     floor jack and a long piece of lumber to lower and raise the exhaust 
     system. Once this is lowered you can remove the sides of the box and 
     will have easy access to the plugs. Hope this helps and please e-mail 
     me if you need further clarification.
     
     Thanks
