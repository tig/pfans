Bonjour Yannick,

I investigating supercharging my 911SC about a year and contacted 
Knoxville Supercharging (Tel: 423-579-1534) for info. They were very 
helpful and sent me some literature on the actual installation 
requirements. They also supplied me with the name of an individual who 
had installed one of their systems on a 911SC.    

There are a few things you should be aware of:
1. Supercharging places a lot of stress on the engine. You need to be 
absolutely sure that your engine is in perfect condition or the 
additional stress will cause problems such as oil blowby resulting in 
accelerated wear. If your engine has a high mileage, the money may be 
better spent on an engine overhaul. 
2. Increasing the horsepower should go with upgrading the brakes. The 
standard 911SC brakes cannot handle 300hp. You will need to go to 
Brembos (about $2000USD) or equivalent.
3. The Knoxville systems involves relocating or removing the heater 
blower. They recommend relocating in the rear fender well!
4. The Knoxville system costs about $5000USD (not cheap).        

As my engine had 170,000Kms, I decided to go with an engine overhaul, 
new fuel injectors, plugs etc. and a B&B header and exhaust system.

These mods. showed 205HP when dyno'ed and together with some valve 
timing changes to improve the torque curve, made my 911SC a pleasure to 
drive even in city traffic.

     By different answers from PorscheFans.com, I know now how I could 
     upgrade my engine power whithout increasing the displacement or 
doing 
     something more expensive !!! As told me Peter.de.Vrey@rivm.nl and 
     cbennet@lmcorp.com, Supercharging will be a good solution (related 
in 
     Bruce Anderson's "911 Performance Handbook" 2nd edition). So I 
would 
     like to ge some informations like :
     
     - the number of Supercharging of Knoxville (the only one provider 
of 
     911 SC 3.0 supercharger), or web links, or e-mail address different 
of 
     pburch@chattanooga.com.
     
     - perhaps, a customer adress in Europe (may be in France ???)
     
     - technicals items about this solution or experience from someone 
     who're the happiest owner of a SC 3.0 with 300 HP.
