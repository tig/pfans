I to am new to the list, having just purchased my first 911.  I share your
joy in owning and driving these fine cars! My car is a 1969, with many
modifications.  The body has been updated to what I beleive to be 1987 Turbo
specs, with boxed rockers and brake air scoops in the rear fenders.  I'm
unsure of who did the body work, but it appears professional (all metal
fenders, good fit-up, repainted jambs, under hood, etc.)  The engine is a
transplanted 1974 2.7liter.  It runs well, doesn/t burn oil, etc. I have
several questions also, these probably seem basic to more seasoned owners,
but bear with me, I'm new to this:

1.  How can I tell what injection is on my car?  I know the 1969 cars had
mechanical fuel injection, and the 1974's had CIS injection.  What are some
of the clues to which type I have?

2.  My car was I beleive originally a 2.0 liter car, so with a 2.7 liter
engine, it seems a little over-geared (2900 rpm at 60 mph).  I know these
engines like to rev, but that seems like a lot of wear on the highway.  How
difficult is it to swap the ring gear in a 911 transmission?  I do a lot of
highway driving and am willing to give up a little acceleration for a lower
rpm on the freeway.

Now for some little parts I'm looking for fix those niggling little problems
you find on a new car:

1.  My rear windows locks are broken.  the RH side is broken on the body
side, only one bolt to mount it.  The LH side is missing one of the arms
(forgive the descriptions).  I have rigged it by bolting the one good arm to
the mating arm, but I cannot lock it.  If anyone has any replacement they
would like to get rid of.

2.  The carpet on the drivers floor is worn badly.  The rest of the carpet
is in good condition, so I don't need to replace it all, but all of the
places I've checked only sell complete kits.  Again, if anyone has this
piece they need to get rid of, let me know.

This list is really helpful.  I subscribed to the 914 list for quite awhile,
and found it very useful.  By the way, having spent my money on a 911, I
need to get rid of my 914 to offset the cost.  Its a 1974 1.8liter 914 in
great condition.  Runs great, looks great, no rust, a really nice car.  If
anyone's interested, let me know and I can get some photos or more
information to them.
