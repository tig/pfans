Josh:

  Changing swaybars on an SC to a set that will make a noticeable
difference involves a few things. The rear bar is a simple swap to a
larger one. These kits usually come with everything you need.

The front bar changeover is more complicated. The underbody bar is
replaced with the 73-and-earlier style that goes through the body behind
the fuel tank. This involves disconnecting the fuel tank and moving it
forward to gain access to the inner fender wells so that the necessary
brackets can be attached. You will also need to remove the existing
brackets on the a-arms and weld on the U-tab kit so the droplinks have
somewhere to attach to. You would be best judge of your mechanical
abilities at this point and how much to want to take on.

These bars have enough adjustment range that we usually use 22mm bars on
the front and rear on the 911SC's. You can use the 19mm bars if you
wish, but the 22's are the most bang-for-the-buck and can be adjusted to
suit your driving style regarding how you want the car to behave.

These size bars shouldn't give the mounting brackets trouble unless you
intend upon a lot of track time with R-1's. In this case, I would
recommend installing the reinforced rear sway bar mounts which do break
loose under extended stress with sticky tires.

I dare not recommend who you might procure these components from that
would give you good service for fear of being smitten,.............

Hope this helps,

Best Regards,
