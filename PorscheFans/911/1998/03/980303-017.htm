Porschefans-
I recently acquired a 1972 911S, the car is in very good mechanical
condition.  While doing a little adjusting on the MFI in order to enable
the car to pass an emissions test I noticed that the injection pump is
timed one drive notch retarded.  When looking at a 71E that belongs to a
friend we noticed the same one tooth retard on his car.  It is possible
that these cars were previously serviced at the same shop to pass the
local emissins test.  Should we immediately retime these pumps? Or is
there some unpublished reason to run these pumps in a retarded position.
I have already asked this question of Gus Pfister at Pacific Fuel
Injection, and he knows of no such reason.  Any information that anyone
can give would be appreciated.

Thank you
Tom Smith

been a real "Brain Fart")
