Can anyone tell me if they noticed a "difference" using a K&N air filter on a
'73 911T Targa?  That sounded really skeptical but I am curious!  What does
the K&N filter oil and the cleaner do?  How often would I use them?  The
literature states that I would get a 33% CFM increase which somehow relates to
a 5-10% HP increase.  I hate to sound like a newby but I am - doesn't the
engine require a certain fuel and air mixture?  If I increase the air flow,
aren't I screwing up the mixture?  

When I first joined this "service" I thought I read something about someone
having trouble with a K&N filter in the damp/moist air or in the rain.  Does
anyone know if this is true?  Does anyone else have any cautions or problems
that they would like to share ( regarding air filters ! )?

Thanks,
Jeff Fuller
