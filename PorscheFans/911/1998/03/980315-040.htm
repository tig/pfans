Ernie:

All the waxes you mentioned (including Nu-Finish) will work fine. 
Personally, I use Meguiar's #26; it's significantly cheaper than
Zymol Titanium ($10 vs. $70) and looks almost as good.

However... The BEST thing you can do to keep your paint from fading
is to buy a car cover and use it whenever your car's parked in the
sun.
