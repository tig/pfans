Michael,

The Clifford Alarm with two buttons in the remote, if I remember correctly,
is one of the simplest ones.  To get it out of the valet mode, you need to
turn your key to the ignition on position and turn the valet switch.  The
valet switch should be a black toggle switch.  The switch is fairly big and
standard looking.  It looks just like a 3Amp. toggle switch you would buy at
an autoparts or RadioShack.  If you can't find the switch, you will provably
be able to find the alarm brain module right under the dash board.  This
module has a sticker that explains what each connection does.  Using a test
light with one end connected to chassis ground, touch the connection labeled
valet switch on the alarm module while the key is turned to the ignition on
position. This will get the alarm off the valet mode unless, there is a
valet switch somewhere that is still switch into the valet mode.

In general, if there is a wire connected to the valet connection on the
alarm, there will be a hidden valet switch somewhere.

If you need more specific info about the alarm, let me know. I think I might
still have some notes somewhere on that model.

Hope this helps
Luis
