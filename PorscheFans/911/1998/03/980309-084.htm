I faced the the same problem on a European
Carrera 3.0 too. I found out that this had been
caused by the vacuum-valve-switch of the CIS
(In germany CIS is called Bosch K-Jetronic).
On European cars it is located on the left
side of the engine right below the heater
blower. It is a tiny black and white shaped
plastic cylinder of a diameter of approx.
4-5cm (A little bit less than 2 inches).
Thickness is about 2cm (less than one inch).
There are two rubber vacuum lines connected to
it, one in the middle and one noncentric. An
electrical plug which has 2 wires is the last
thing mounted to it. 

On cold start this valve is opened and will
influence the warm-up regulator (mounted be-
tween intake lines of cylinder 1 and 2) to
provide more fuel (change the air/fuel mixture
to more fuel) for running the engine at
a higher idle speed.

After a few seconds this valve will close.
Now the warm-up regulator is not been influenced
by additional vacuum anymore. Idle speed should lower
a little bit. On my car from ~1600Upm to ~1100Upm.
After the warm-up regulator has warmed up idle
will fall down to ~800..900Upm.

Please check if the electrical plug is connected
to the tiny vacuum-valve-switch. Otherwise the
bimetal inside vacuum-valve-switch will not warmed
by the electrical heat inside and valve will never
close. Engine remains on high idle.

Please check if one of the two rubber vacuum lines
is brocken or not mounted. If one is left open the
engine runs on high idle even if it is warmed up.

Best regards
