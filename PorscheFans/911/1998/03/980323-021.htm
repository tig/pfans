Alan,

I don't know if you've already received this message. My digest for =
March 22 was all screwed up so I don't know if this has already posted.

P-Fans, sorry if you get this twice.

Samer

All the answers you received about Dyna-Mat are correct. What you need =
to do is install the stuff inside the doors (inner-skin) to achive the =
most sound deadening and reduce vibration and resonnance from speakers =
installed in the doors.

You also wrote:

The best thing you can do is move the speakers (both the midrange and =
the tweeter as high as you can in the door. I realize this is sometimes =
impossible especially for the midrange (because of size constraints), =
but if you can only move the tweeters up then you will notice an =
improvement in sound quality. If you do, make sure they stay relatively =
close to the midrange, otherwise the sound will not blend together.  =
Another thing you can do to improve sound quality, is to properly aim =
the tweeters to your listening position, in order to achieve better =
"imaging". The idea is to make the sound seem like it is coming from the =
middle top of your dash. You should be able to visualize the band (or =
the singer) sitting on the dash. One way to achieve that is to aim the =
RIGHT tweeter to the driver position (at head level) and the LEFT =
tweeter to the passenger position (again at head level). Try =
experimenting with the tweeters before you permanently install them.

As for suggestions on rear speakers, 4x6 speakers will fit perfectly in =
the back, and there are a lot of them out there. My personal =
recommendation is to stick to speakers made by an American manufacturer =
as they are always the best sounding. My favorites are Boston Acoustics =
746. They are a plate type (rectangular shape) of speaker with separate =
drivers (mids and tweeters). Also check out their C700II model, which I =
am not sure will fit in the rear deck because it is bigger. It is also a =
plate type, with bigger dimensions, which also means bigger mids (the =
bigger the better, more mid-bass), and requiring only 1 1/2 inch =
mounting depth and 3 1/2 inch cutout diameter.

Finally, for bass, and since space is at a premium in 911's, try a =
self-amplified subwoofer. You might go to your local car audio =
specialist and have them try one out for you without commiting to it. If =
it is of the self amplified type, it will not take a whole lot of their =
time to hook it up and demonstrate it for you.

Good Luck
