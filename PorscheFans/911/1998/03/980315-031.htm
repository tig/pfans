>>OK.  I have gotten a number of opinions, but it seems likely that I may have
to replace my rear wheel bearings (88 Cab).  I have gone through Haynes
several times and I have a couple questions I thought someone might help
me
with.

1.  How do you torque the hub nut to 300lbs do I need a new wrench?
2.  How difficult is it to drive the hub out and what do I use?
3.  Can the bearing be removed without the expense of buying a puller? 
4.  How do the press the bearing in without special tools.

On the front bearings, basically I just whacked the races out and in. 
Not the
most elegant solution, but it worked.

Any help would be appreciated.

I do know it makes a world of difference (allot easier) to heat your
front hubs up on your barbeque grill or other device to about 250
degrees in order to drive out the bearing races.  The hubs are soft
alloy and easily damaged.  I don't think the rear ones are as easy to do
