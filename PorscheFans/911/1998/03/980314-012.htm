Very good question.  To answer this, I will list the causes of oil
contamination or getting "dirty", and explain how synthetic oils help
minimize this, if at all.

wear metals - These are particles from the engine that get dissolved in
the oil as the engine wears.  Having superior lubricity in the oil
results in less wear, hence, less wear metals.

oil breakdown - This is where the oil itself breaks down over time and
basically contaminants itself with the "worn out" parts.  Synthetics
have a superior molecular structure and do not break down as easily.

combustion chamber blowby - This is where contaminants get blown past
the rings in the combustion chamber.  This situation is usually worse in
turbocharged motors because of the increase in pressure within the
chamber.  A good synthetic will adhere better to the moving parts,
forming a better seal, and lessening blowby.  You will always get some
degree of blowby, even if only slight.  Also, a synthetic will not "burn
off" as easily as a petroleum oil and become instantly overcooked.  The
small amount of oil that gets near the combustion seal on the rings can
burn and become part of the oil breakdown described above.

contaminants coming in from fuel/air - This is where most people think
their oil gets dirty from, but it should be the least factor, if you are
using a good quality air filter and it seals properly around the edges. 
Also, vacuum leaks suck in fresh, dirty air, which is real bad.  More
dirt from the air causes more wear metals in the oil, so it's a domino
effect.  Synthetic oil cannot help the fuel/air system filtering
situation, but I wanted to point it out, as many only think of this as
the primary cause of oil getting "dirty".

I hope this clarifies everyone's thinking of how oils become
non-serviceable and how this should factor your thinking of when and why
to change the oil, based on what type of oil you are using.  I am only
addressing the question of the contamination of petroleum vs. synthetic
oils here and nothing else.
