Anyone ever had a problem with their fan rubbing on the aluminum shroud that
the fan sits in?  Mine started making slight split-second scraping noises
every once in a while, but it was barely noticeable.  Today, I started the
car, and the thing REALLY rubbed, and would not stop.  There are tiny metal
(magnesium?) shavings all over from where the fan scaped on the lower half of
the shroud.

Is it possible the alternator is not mounted onto the shroud quite right?  I
recall from when I changed the alt before that it is almost impossible to get
the fan off the alternator.  Perhaps when I pulled it, I ended up messing
something up.  I recall hammering like crazy with a mallet to get it off.  I
guess I will spend my Sunday pulling the thing apart. Any suggestions on
getting the fan off the alternator?

Car is a 1983 911SC w/ 11-blade fan (or whatever the larger number of blades
was that Porsche went to in the late 70s).  Thanks!   -Dal
