After numerous message to and from the list, long debate and sleepless
nights, the nightblue 1988 911 Carrera finally sits in my garage. I
sometimes sneak up to her to secretly watch how good she looks. Then it
starts to tingle and I'm running to get the keys, open the garage door
and take her out for a drive.

Unfortunately, since I picked her up, it has not stopped raining.
However, I was amazed how smooth a 911 can be. Especially after all the
horror stories I heard here and elsewhere on how difficult they are in
slippery conditions. Oh, mine is no different, but I guess I'll be
staying on the safe side of her potential and my driving skills. This
Saturday evening, I went for a drive in the countryside. No traffic, but
very narrow and winding roads I'm starting to know rather well. I had
rained just a little bit, just enough to make the road surface damp.
Yes, they do understeer and yes they oversteer on command, but
everything is so smooth. You have to understand I am comparing with a
souped up Miata engine (1.6 liter 16 valve with a 140 to 145 HP output
at 6500 RPM and close to no torque, well some, at 5500 RPM).

Having done some mileage in the rain, the nightblue was becoming a
lighter shade of grey, and when this weekend the clouds stayed away long
enough, I got her out to get her cleaned, thoroughly. What a joy, going
around the curved surfaces I've been dreaming about for so long (I have
a feeling this line of thinking is moving away from cars ... ;-) ). My
wife didn't like me spending the better part of Sunday cleaning the car,
but the result even convinced her. She does not really like the idea of
me spending our good money on an other boy toy, but she is gradually
turning around. Especially since my two year old is talking about
daddy's "Posch-e Wagen, Pappa", and wants to get in the car all the
time. He even helped me wash the car, which at a certain point did get
me in to some more trouble with his mother, and in the end considerably
lengthened to process of getting the car clean & dry.

I think you all get the picture. 911's do grow on you. I for one
definitely like mine and don't regret a second the decision to finally
go out and buy one.
