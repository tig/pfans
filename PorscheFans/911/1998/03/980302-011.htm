Hi all,
I have just heard a weird (unusual, heart wrenching) noise on my 78' SC.
When I start the car, I hear a distinct rattle from the motor. Kind of
like (taka-taka-taka-taka-taka). After driving for a while it goes away.
When I am driving it I never hear it. Also, if I step outside I don't
hear it, unless I put my ears next to the rear fender on the passenger
side.
My car history shows that the PO purchased chain tensioners, whether he
put them on himself or with a friend, I have to take his word on that.
The noise is defiantly coming out from the passenger side of the motor.
Is it my chain tensioners, or is it something else?  Also I had a minor
mishap with my 911 being stuck in the mud (went off the road during the
rain, still getting used to the rear motor). To get it out, I had to rev
it up pretty hard. Since that little incidence, the rattling noise has
extrapolated.
Would love to hear from others. I am not going to touch my 911 until I
figure out what is going on.
