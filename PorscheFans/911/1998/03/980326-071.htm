I had my car in for a valve adjustment today and as I drove home I noticed
that my oil level was high. I stopped to get fuel and checked the oil the
old fasioned way (car level, engine running at temp). Sure enough the
dipstick indicated "Full". I mean exactly at the top indicator. 

I've been taught (by you on this list!) that the ideal is right in the
middle.

So the question is: Should I ruin my wife's turkey baster and suck some oil
out or just not worry about it. This car does not consume or leak oil at all
so if I don't do anything it will stay at this level until I next change the
oil.

Thanks in advance,

Charlie Kindel

p.s. if you know the saga of my premature valve guide wear, you might wonder
why I got my vavles adjusted. Barrier Motors who has done all the service
said that they would need to adjust the valves after I've driven a 1000
miles or so after the rebuild. I'm even more convinced that I'll buy more
cars from them in the future: I thought they might ask me to pay for this
adjustment. They did not.
