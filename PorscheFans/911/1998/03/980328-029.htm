Hi P-Nuts,
Here is what I found in researching my loping idle problem (if you
remember from my previous post, it was only during warm-up from cold
start).  "Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management" by Charles O.
Probst, in discussing the lambda thermoswitch,  says, "When the engine
is cold, the thermoswitch is closed.  The control unit sends a fixed,
slightly-rich duty-cycle signal of 60% (in my case 65%) to the lambda
control valve.  When the thermoswitch warms enough to open, the control
unit sends a fixed middle signal, 50% duty cycle.  When the lambda
sensor reaches operating temperature so its signals are valid, the
control unit switches to closed-loop operation."

After modifying the WUR to make it adjustable, and setting the cold
control pressure in spec, I checked the basic mixture setting and found
it to be very lean (duty cycle was 90%).  So, although my car started
fine and initially idled smoothly, as soon as the thermoswitch opened
and the control unit began sending the fixed 50% signal, the mixture was
far too lean and the engine began surging.  After the O2 sensor warmed
up, the lambda feedback loop took care of the too-lean condition and the
engine smoothed out.  Anyway, after setting the basic mixture correctly,
the cold start and warm up is flawless.
