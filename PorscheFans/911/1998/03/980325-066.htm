George,

Taking off door panels in an '80 SC is not difficult and requires only a
phillips head and flat screwdriver and an allen-head wrench.  Take off
the top trim - one screw may be hidden behind a plastic cap on the trim
at the rear of the door, the other is on the inside front of the door
(normally hidden under the base of the front door frame).  Pocket is
attached at the side (to the pocket cover), to the door handle (under
the pocket cover) and underneath, a total of 6 screws.  Pocket cover has
two flat screws which hold the hinge (at the rear of the door); the
other end slides into the door handle.  The screw holding the lock knob
on is under a plastic cap, which pries off.  Release the door lever by
reaching behind it and pulling up gently on the metal lever.  Behind
this lever are two allen head screws deeply recessed into the handle;
you will need a long allen head wrench to get to them (not sure of
size).  The other two allen head screws are visible at the top of the
door, normally covered by the top trim.  The panel is now attached by
three press-in fasteners; just pull gently along the rear edge and the
top front edge and they will pull out.

On my car, with electric windows, you have to pull off 5 wires from the
switch (MARK THEIR LOCATION!).  I haven't done one with a manual
handle.  Additionally, the driver's side door has a harness that presses
into the mirror adjustment switch and just pulls off.  The panel should
now be free from the door.

Regarding speakers, in the front you can generally use 5 1/4"-6 1/2"
speakers, but placement is limited by the cutout in the sheet metal.
Check clearances of larger speakers with respect to inner door frame
wiring and window mechanisms before committing to them.  The existing
cutout in the panel itself may also influence your choice.

Tweeters normally sit either very shallow in the door panel or jut out
from it (as do my Alpines, 2"); placement is thus largely up to you.
Samer Hijazi had some interesting comments on tweeter placement in the
March 23rd digest.  Note that if you use this arrangement, you'll
probably need to place the crossover inside the door itself.

Rear deck is most easily suited to 4" x 6", but there are other sizes of
plate-type speakers which will work (but are more expensive).  See
Samer's comments on these, and also Eric Brown's notes about rear
speakers, including rear tweeters, in the March 20th digest (message
49).

Hope this helps, and enjoy the exploration of your car and its new
speakers!  Let us know what you choose.
