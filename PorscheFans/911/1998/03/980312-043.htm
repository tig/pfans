I just ordered a helmet for Autocross, later for DE, from OG Racing. I
tried in vain to locate a place in Orlando (the known
Center-of-the-Universe) with SA-95's. Anyway, after running downtown to try
on an M95 that the jacka-- that owns the store told me was "SA" over the
phone, I elected to mail-order. Apparently, the helmets M vs SA have
different liners, the SA being fire-proof or fire-resistant. They may have
different shatter/crush characteristics. Nevertheless, the M95 helmet that
I had tried on in the store was the same size as the SA that I ordered
after measuring. I'll let the group know how the MO helmet is.
