>Hi Fans:
>Thanks for all the good advice on adjusting valves. 
>First question is regarding brake pad wear lights. I recently changed F&R

>and have to be replaced?

That is how they work.  The wear sensor is simple a loop of wire
down into the brake pad and back.  When the pad wears down, the
disk begins to wear into the sensor wire.  When the wire has been
worn thru, the circuit is broken, and the little sensor light comes
on.  So, yes, you need to replace the wear sensor (which ever one
is worn through) when you replace the pads.

>Second question is regarding the oil additives that bilstein and lubromoly

>Lastly. Thanks for all the notes on K&N filters. I've had one for over two
