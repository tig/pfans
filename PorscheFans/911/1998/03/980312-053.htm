It's about time for the car to come out of winter storage & time for me to get busy on some jobs so it's ready to go when salt & slush is off the roads.  The muffler needs to be replaced and while that's off I'll deal with the chain tensioners.  The car is a '76 Targa, 2.7, 70K miles, original condition.  I drive it about 5K annually around town, weekend trips, etc - no racing, dr ed, etc.

My question is:   1) should I replace the stock tensioners with new ones of the same style,  2) rebuild the ones that are in the car or   3) go ahead and install hydraulic tensioners.

I've always figured that when the time came, I would go with the newer style pressure fed tensioners, but recently a long-time Porsche mechanic told me that the way I use the car there is no real need to do anything but rebuild the original tensioners every 50-70K miles.

I would greatly appreciate hearing suggestions, advice, personal experience, etc on this topic - especially the matter of rebuilding early style 911 chain tensioners.

Thanks,

Dick Key, 76 911S Targa
