I had the front brake disks turned (cut) yesterday.  After putting them =
back, I took the car for a drive and found out that if I pump the brake =
pedal, it grabs high (normal like before) but as soon as I drive off, it =
goes back to grabbing really low.

Is there some thing I was supposed to do after turning the rotors.  Or =
could this now be a different problem that just happened to surface =
after this repair.

What could cause the pedal to loose pressure like that?

Any help would be appreciated.

Luis
