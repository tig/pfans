Greg,

I know from reading prior lists that you are near the end of restoring
your SC. If your experience is like mine, you have probably spend much
more time and money on this project than originally intended (some
variant of Murphy's law, no doubt). Regarding painting your wheels
yourself, I think the issue has two parts: 1) how professional/original
a look do you want?, and 2) how long do you want it to last?

Remember that stock Fuchs alloys are anodized and require special
treatment to get the 'factory' look, along with regular cleaning and
polishing to keep it.  While Vic (see above in today's list) notes you
can get a 'decent' job using Wurth spray paint, my own experience with
my other car (which, if I remember right, is an '88 Toyota Supra Turbo),
painting trim such as windshield frames/wiper arms with similar black
paint looks okay for a while but will soon pass.  Especially given the
dirt and brake dust wheels are exposed to, I can't help but think even a
good amateur job will fade relatively quickly.

In my own case, I am planning to either have my black center Fuchs
repainted white to match the car (an RSR look) or go with a 3-piece
wheel with white centers and black caps/nuts.  I agree with Vic that
getting original black Fuchs from a dealer, along with a trade of your
current wheels, is a good idea.  Or look into refinishing at places like
Rennsport in Georgia (www.rennsport.com, 770.992.9442) or Wheel
Enhancement in California (www.wheelenhancement.com, 310.836.8908).
Cost should be somewhere in the $500-700 range for 4 wheels.  Wheel
Enhancement takes trade-ins, and will likely be my choice if I choose to
refinish my wheels.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
