James,
I can't help you on the pressure thing, but I had a '90 C2 once and the
notorious distributor belt problem bit me in the ass at about 45,000 miles.
At the time it happened, the only fix on the market was to get a new
distributor ($900+) and send in the old one for a refund ($400), so the net
effect was that I ate $500 plus $100+ of labor.   Now I understand they
have a fix where they can just replace the belt when it breaks for much
less but I here the labor on this is still a bit steep.

Still, the better, proactive fix is to get the distributor ventilation kit
installed before it breaks!  This is the factory fix that became factory
equipment in '93 if I'm not mistaken.  It ducts a bit of air into the
distributor and prevents those "ozone fumes" from screwing up the belt.   I
went ahead and had this installed after my problem for about $75 and I
never had a problem again.  I later owned a '91 C2 and had it installed
again as soon as I got the car...no problems after that.  I wish I had
known it was available before my '90 C2 incident popped up!

-Eric
