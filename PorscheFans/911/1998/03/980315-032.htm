I use zymol, that good expensive stuff. Not the junk from kmart.

consumer reports also said the zymol was the best for brightness or
something like that, but the cost thru them off. I find that even though
more expensive to purchase it is not more expensive overall.

My porsches sit inside and when outside do have a cover over them. So maybe
my experience is not like most.

I also use back again and number 42 from Mequires. One thing to remember
cars paint etc everything ages all we can do is slow this down, not stop it. 

Armorall is very big no no it does funny things to rubber vynl etc.
