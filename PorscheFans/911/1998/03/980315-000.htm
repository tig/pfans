Jad,

     You bring up a good point.  I run Mobil 1 in my car because I get it at a
good price and so far I haven't heard anyone with bad experiences.  I change
it every 3,000 miles because I believe oil gets cantaminated by blow by
(exhuat gases) and is diluted with fuel over it's lifetime. I believe almost
nothing can be told by looking at oil and dirty looking oil may have as much
to do with the detergent aspect of the oil as it does with how long it's been
in or the condition of the engine.  At the margin it's clear Synthetics have
the edge, this may not be important but they're isn't much to argue against
it.  So it get's down to wheather you want to spend the extra money to feel
good about running synthetic oil in you car.  To me it's worth it because I
don't put many miles on my car and I do all the service myself.  Synthetics
tend to keep your engine a little cleaner (IMO) too.  Now,  if I was running a
fleet business I wouldn't be running synthetics in my vehicles.  I just don't
think it makes sense economically,  but emotionally?  :)

Subject: synthetic oil biases
To: 911@porschefans.com

I am confused by the apparent bias of several people on this list towards
synthetic oils.  The newest one that confuses me is the general acceptance
of oil changes being needed do to the oil getting dirty, not oil break
down.  I agree with this, but don't understand the conclusion that usually
follows of changing regular oil every ~3000 and synthetics every ~5000.
Why do synthetics get dirty slower?  Just curious, and still happily using
normal oil in my baby  until someone provides any reasonable basis for
spending 3 to 10 times more for a quart of oil in my daily
driver/autocrosser in a very moderate climate.
