Ron,

While this sound's bizarre (well, it is, I guess), I think the explanation
is pretty straightforward.

The 5th/Reverse selector fork is broken and that shaft is stuck in
reverse.   When you engage any forward gear you have one gear
trying to move the car forward against the engaged reverse gear.

Sadly, there would be no alternative than to have the transmission 
torn down and repaired.    The good news is that this can be handled 
with a minimum disassembly of the transmission, though the engine
and transaxle still have to come out of the car.    Once that is done,
I believe the repair can be made in a couple of hours and a new 
selector fork.

Dave
