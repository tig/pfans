<< I have the '87 911 and I have an excellent '86 M-B 560SL, Hdt./conv.
 Both are great cars and they are both extra cars...not daily drivers. 
 Question:  Do I sell both of them and buy a '95 993 or do you get enough of
 the 911 experience with the '87 Carrera, plus the added plus of a
 convertible in the 560SL and a totally opposite experience with it as well.
 I've had lots of cars like most of you and can and will of course make up my
 own mind, but it's amazing the good ideas you get when you listen. 
 
 I have reservations even posting this as it may appear like a spoiled
 whatever can't make up it's mind...but this is the issue....any opinions are
 greatly appreciated.....regards

Bob:

I've had  Porsches for over 35 years and always used them as an occasional
driver.  Periodically, over the years as new models of competing vehicles came
out I had  the idea that I could replace the Porsche with a "daily driver"
that would give 90 percent of the enjoyment of ownership at 50 percent of the
cost.  Did that once in selling my 72 911 Targa and buying a new Datsun 260Z
after two years of "rave reviews"  of the then newly introduced 240Z.   It
lasted 6 months and I hated every day I owned it until I could again get a
Porsche.  Age (and experience) doesn't improve the situation much.  Three plus
years ago, with my 88 Carrera and 86 MB 190E 2.3-16, I again decided that the
911 was just too much money to depreciate in the garage for occasional use of
a "retirement" person.  And gosh, again rave reviews from every automotive
journal on the then-new BMW M-3.  Sold the "perfect" 88 Carrera and got the
M-3...better in every way (perhaps!) than both including the  "old" MB 190E-16
except...I just didn't like it (perhaps too many 3-series wannabe
lookalikes???)  BTW, famous Porsche "guru" thought I was nuts because M-3 was
everything the 190E-16 "could have been" over the years if Mercedes had
continued to develop and market that 2-year (for the US) vehicle.
But sadly (for me at least), the M-3 was too smooth, powerful, no quirky
instincts, too easy for every (moron/braindead/etc...you choose) to act like
Michael Schumaker wannabees...and BLAND to the point of invisibility, that I
learned to hate it!  Out it went to a nice young doctor and his wife.

So...back to the fountain...could never find a 87-89 Carrera as nice as the
one I sold so pony-out of the retirement savings for one more Porsche...a 97
993 (at least it's $30K the SOB's in the HMO's and Nursing homes will never
get...:-))

Better than the 88?...definitely...at least the Air Conditioning works
reasonably well...worth $30K more than an 88 Carrera as an occasional
driver...NOPE!

Your Porsche and MB represent different segments of the automobile enthusiast
spectrum...enjoy them both but don't give up "2 for 1" (particularly a 95 993)
or you'll regret it...(at least IMO).  Over time, upgrade one at a time (if
necessary) but keep both to give a range of enjoyment (unless you can find a
nice 288 GTO) that only a few can appreciate.
