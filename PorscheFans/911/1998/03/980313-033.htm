Bill Lamb asked about putting an optima battery in a pre-73 911;

I currently have one in my 71 911E and it is the best move to make
concerning batteries. I installed mine on the driver's side and the battery
does lay on it's side. you will probably need a new negative cable that is
a bit longer so the battery will slide into the pocket all the way. also
you may want to line the pocket with those battery mats just so there is no
contact between terminals and car body. you will need to either purchase an
extension holddown strap(several catalogs I've seen have them) or fabricate
one out of some flexible metal (like I did) to secure the optima in the
pocket. it is a nice simple conversion and does away with battery leakage.

as for weight and balance it doesn't seem to have any effect for street use
and occassional auto-x but if you were into serious track stuff you
probably want to do a corner balance with scales and maybe you would need
to add some balast??

good luck
