    Chris:

    Drilled rotors ALWAYS crack.  Slotted rotors work just as well
    and aren't nearly as susceptible to cracking, especially if
    there's a radius in the slots rather than sharp 90-degree
    angles.

    So does everyone else.

    Yes.

    Troutman will slot your rotors for something like $35 each... Or
    they can slot a set of new rotors and ship them to you.  I don't
    know what they charge for C2 rotors, so you should call them: 
    800 356-9307.
