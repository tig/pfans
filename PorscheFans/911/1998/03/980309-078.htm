The E-mail below described my need for a battery for my 993.  Well, I
found one- the car is whole again!

There is a local auto parts chain called Autozone.  They had a battery in
the right size - Group 48, same dimensions and mounting points as OE,
incl. bottom flange mount and recessed top terminals and positive
terminal cover (although took the OE off old battery to better clear
993 battery wiring).  700 CCA, 5 year warranty, $60 incl. trade-in.  Only
manuf. info on it is "Autozone" name.  Body is black, is a sealed battery.
Local independent Porsche shop has installed several on various models
with no problems.

Also, connected regulated trickle charger across cable terminals before
disconnecting old battery, kept it connected when removed battery.
Never lost radio memory.

Well, I recently discovered I need a new battery on my '95 993 (inadvertently 
let some cells go dry).

WARNING TO OTHERS - THESE ARE NOT SEALED BATTERIES; YOU 
SHOULD CHECK ELECTROLYTE LEVEL NOW AND THEN

I was wondering what other folks have used in either 993 or 964.  I have 
had bad luck in past with aftermarket batteries on my '84, largely due to 
the mounting method which is at the lower flange.  Is a dealer unit the 
only option to keep OE mounting?
