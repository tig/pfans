If you want to use the gravity method of bleeding then do not depress 
the brake pedal. If you do depress the brake pedal then the pistons 
in the M/C  travel past the holes in the M/C that allow the brake 
fluid in from the resevoir and hence you will get no flow.

This is actually a handy tip if you are removing a caliper for a 
short amount of time, press the brake pedal a bit and hold it there 
with a bit of wood or something to the drivers seat then you get 
little or no fluid loss whilst the pipe is disconnected.

I have not tried the gravity method but I can imagine it being ok for 
changing fluid but if you have a lot of air in the system I know how 
hard this is to remove using the other two methods and I wonder how 
good the gravity method would be for this.

Good luck and let us all know how you get on.
