Tom Smith toms@comtch.iea.com asked :

>> I recently acquired a 1972 911S, the car is in very good mechanical
condition.  While doing a little adjusting on the MFI in order to enable
the car to pass an emissions test I noticed that the injection pump is
timed one drive notch retarded.  When looking at a 71E that belongs to a
friend we noticed the same one tooth retard on his car.  It is possible
that these cars were previously serviced at the same shop to pass the
local emissins test.  Should we immediately retime these pumps? Or is
there some unpublished reason to run these pumps in a retarded position.
I have already asked this question of Gus Pfister at Pacific Fuel
Injection, and he knows of no such reason.  Any information that anyone
can give would be appreciated. <<

It was explained to me by automotive engineer/PCA guru Bob (?)
White, who like us is an owner of a '72 S, that Porsche decided after 
testing that the MFI timing was not at all critical. He said that they found
the optimum was actually to inject the gas on the head of a closed
valve just before opening, which I believe would mean to advance the timing
of the pump. But still would not really help much. So I doubt there
is anything significant to your timing but you can reset it if it will
make you feel better.

Not at all!!!! If it's a solid original car IMHO you've made a good
move. I see the market looking better for pre 1974 vintage cars
than pre 1965 vintage cars as young boomers are getting to the age
where we can afford toys, and want something with some
guts not just cuteness ;-). We could give a damn about model T fords
etc, give us muscle cars!! Of course I'm biased...
