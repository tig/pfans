Jeffrey:

Leaded gas hurts nothing except the environment and catalytic
converters.  Leaded race gas will do no harm to your engine... In
fact, with an 11:1 compression ratio, I'd never run anything BUT 
race gas.

Keep in mind that UNLEADED race fuel with octane ratings in the
100-110 range is pretty easy to find... You don't NEED to use leaded
gas unless you're looking for 115-120 octane.
