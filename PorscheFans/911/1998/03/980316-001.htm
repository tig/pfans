    Donald:

    LOW mileage engines may have problems with synthetics, since
    synthetic oil sometimes prevents rings from seating, but a 
    high-mileage engine won't exhibit those problems.

    20W50.  Don't use real racing oil, by the way... You need the
    detergents that are in street-car oils.

    Sure, but make sure that you're using the right formulation.

    Most Porsche transmissions need a gear oil with "GL-5"
    protection... So if you decide to use Redline gear oil, for
    instance, you need to use 75W90 or 75W90NS rather than MTL or
    MT90.

    Personally, I like Redline.

    Some people believe that Mobil 1 offers equivalent performance
    for half the price; I disagree, but not strongly enough to get
    into a big debate over it.
