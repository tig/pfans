     hi everyone ,
     
        have a cooling question on my 97x66 mm (2.925 liter motor)
     the last 2 days were kind of warm here in so. new hampshire
     70 - 80 deg.And so i took the car out , beeting on it a little.
     or should i say 'aggresivily testing the engine performance window' !
     and have been noticing that the engine temp. is around 120c + , and 
     this is with a large front mounted cooler , with the proper oil 
     lines.the oil cooler is hot to the touch , so i know im getting good 
     oil flow to the front,so i think the problem is not enough forced air 
     cooling for the engine.Presently i have an 11 blade fan with the large 
     size pulley on it. off i think a '77 3.0 carrera.I think what i need 
     is the larger 3.3 turbo fan / housing assy , with maybe a larger crank 
     pulley as well .I originaly picked the 11 blade fan with large pulley 
     because i heard that it was bad to run the fan at a high rpm , This 
     engine runs up to around 8,000 rpm or so.anyone have any input on 
     increasing air cooling for my motor ?.and what is a safe limit to run 
     the engine fan at, i heard the air flow cavitates above a certain fan 
     rpm.
     
     also anyone have a 3.3 turbo fan/housing for sale ??
     
     any input would be appriciated , as track events will be starting 
     soon.
     
     thanks in advance,
