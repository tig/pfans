Jad,

Other than a visual inspection I know of no way to tell if a belt is 
_about_ to break.  When my belt did break the dealer helped me confirm 
it.  Yeah, you can remove the caps and see if the rotors a synchronized 
but I find it nearly impossible to get access to the secondary cap 
screws.  If you follow the center tap from each distributor cap back to 
the left engine compartment wall you will find they both terminate with 
a connector at the final stage.  Remove the connector for the primary 
distributor and attempt to start the car. If it starts it means it is 
running on the secondary distributor and the belt must be intact.

If you are somewhat mechanically inclined it is very easy to remove the 
distributor and visually inspect the belt.  To remove the distrubutor 
first remove the plastic blower duct.  Then remove the primary 
distributor cap and mark the location of the rotor relative to the 
distrubutor housing.  At this point you can remove the distributor hold 
down bolt and remove the distributor from the engine.  Before removing 
the distributor throughly clean the base to prevent dirt from entering 
the engine.  As you are withdrawing the distrubutor note which 
direction the rotor turns and mark its final position.  This will aid 
reinstallation and getting the engine timed correctly.  After removing 
the distributor you can remove the other cap and peer down inside to 
inspect the belt.

As for power loss my experience was that when the belt broke the power 
loss was immediate and very obvious.  Mine only pinged a couple of 
times before I was able to park it for diagnosis.

I shipped mine to Zim's for repair as I couldn't find anyone local who 
could do it.  Since then I believe more shops are performing this 
repair.  I believe that Rennsport Systems in Portland, OR is offering 
this service with a 24 hour turnaround.  Check out

 I was wondering if there is any easy way to know if the belt has or is
about to break?  One post said the '!' light comes on.  My car has the vent
kit, but occasionally it seems the car has a little less power (probably my
imagination, the last time was after my wife took the PCA driving school in
it) and I worry that the belt has broken and that I may be damaging the
engine.  Last night I pulled a plug wire and started the car.  The
distributor cap seemed to arc from the point to the cap so I assume both
are working, but doubt this is a good way to test.  Any input would be
appreciated.
