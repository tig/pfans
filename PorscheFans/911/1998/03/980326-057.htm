Following cars are For Sale:

1) 1966 912. Original California black plate car. No rust - excellent body,
european model (heater system etc.). Paint is medium blue looks good.
Interior is black and in fair condition.  I will be putting new head liner
and rubber seals in shortly.  Engine is low miles with a fresh valve job.
Car runs really well, is very tight on the road and looks good.  Chrome
wheels with good rubber.  The car is ready to drive and a nice undamaged
car.  Price $4,500.

2) 1968 912.  Also an original california car.  The car has rust in the
floor as the result of a leaky windshield seal but it is not bad.
Suspension is fine and the body is perfect except for the floor.  The paint
is a copper brown and needs some attention.  Interior is very nice.  Engine
has Webber carburetors.  Wheels are 15x6 alloys.  The rear end has the kit
to convert it to a later 911 look ("Porsche" reflector between rubber bumper
guards).  Price on this is $3,500 - 4,500 depending on what happens to the
car with restoration.  I'm planning to have the rusted parts of the floor
replaced and new rubber seals installed for the front and rear glass.  This
is also a tight driving car.

3) 1972 911T Sunroof.  Good dry car with no rust.  Excellent mechanicals
with very strong engine updated to externally oiled chain tensioners.
Silver/black. Front spoiler/bumper was repaired poorly.  Paint looks ok but
is mediocre.  Interior is in good shape with the wrong seats.  A little TLS
on the cosmetics and this is a nice car.  Redoing the brakes.  6" Alloys
with good rubber.  Price $5,500.  I like the car but I'm to big for a
sunroof.  Bump my head.

Will do package price.  Shipping arranged.  Located in Oakland CA with local
delivery possible. Email response or call evening number 510-533-5040
