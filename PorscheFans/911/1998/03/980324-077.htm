    David:

    The 930 was imported to the USA between 1976 and 1979; there
    were also a small number of "1980" models imported in late 1979,
    but they were identical to the 1979 cars.

    Porsche stopped making US-spec 930s in 1980, and didn't start
    again until 1986.

    US emissions laws, mostly.

    There are lots of small differences, and a few big ones.  If you
    have a choice, the later cars are probably more desirable than
    the '76 and '77 cars... The engine had no intercooler in '76,
    and it displaced only 3 liters until 1978, when it was bumped to
    3.2 liters.

> Where would I find a 930 prior to 1985 and how much would it cost?

    Here on the list, maybe... Or in the Porsche Panorama, Porsche
    Market Letter, Autoweek, Hemmings Motor News, your local
    newspaper, or any of the used-car sites on the world-wide web.

    If you're only considering street cars in their stock
    configuration, no.
