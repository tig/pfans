I came in late on the dialog concerning pressure brake bleeding.  I noticed 
that someone asked how to construct a pressure bleeding tank and cap for the 
brake fluid reservoir.  A few years back I found a system in a British car 
mag. called EZbleed.  It comes with a bottle, hoses, multiple reservoir caps 
(including one that fit both my 944t and my 911) and a connection to clamp on 
to a tire valve stem for air supply.  I and numerous local club members have 
used the system for replacing brake system fluid and have also serviced the 
clutch reservoir.  I have noticed the EZbleed advertised in various car 
publications from time to time for about $40 to $60.  Its made by a company 
located in the UK.  

I alternate between the ATE blue and amber fluids each time I bleed the 
system.  When the color of the fluid changes at the caliper bleed I know the 
fluid has been completely replaced for that section of the circuit.  I have 
got to the point that it takes longer to remove the tires then it takes to 
bleed the whole brake system.  I am a strong proponent of replacing brake 
fluid before any track event, having had an unexpected off track excursion 
due to brake fade.
