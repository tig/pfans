The fellow that relates this story, George Morrison, is not a hoax. I
exchanged some email with him a few years ago, around the time he posted his
experience. Whether or not the events he relates actually happened, I would
not know. He does have a background in lubrication, though I do not know
what his formal education is, and I also am not aware of any vested interest
that would bias him against K&N filters. I believe he does have an interest
in the oil analysis business.

There is no doubt that if a paper element's area is too small, there will be
a significant pressure drop across the element, which will translate to
reduced horsepower. The solution to this problem is simple for the designer:
increase the area of the paper element. Not normally a difficult thing to
do, and I don't think Porsche would overlook this in the pursuit of even so
few as 4-5 horsepower.

You might also consider the 'failure mode' of a paper element as opposed to
an oil/mesh or oil/foam element like the K&N: As a paper element fills with
dirt, it does an even better job of keeping dirt out of the engine, since
dirt is making the spaces in the filter even smaller. You will of course see
a larger pressure drop across the filter, and a decrease in available power.
A K&N depends on 'catching' dirt with its oil. As it fills with dirt, the
ability of this oil to catch the next particle is reduced, and potentially
more dirt may enter the engine.

I suppose if you keep your K&N clean, it will do an excellent job of
catching dirt. But don't get lazy with it or you'll pay the price. It might
even give you a smaller pressure drop across the filter than a Porsche
original equipment paper element, but I suspect this difference is
miniscule. With other cars, YMMV.
