Fans,

I had chance to discuss with the local Porsche rep several matters =
including the removal of the engine undertray on my 993. Specifically as =
regards the cooling issue Porsche has instructed dealers not to remove =
the undertray. Evidently almost all of the cooling of the engine occurs =
from air moving over the top of the car and down on to the engine. Air =
moving under the car is not "swept up" in fact it is pushed down ( the =
air pushing down is what causes the rear end to lift as speed is =
increased) and therefore air flowing under the car does practically =
nothing to cool the engine. In fact it is the opposite. The engine =
undertray is specifically designed to eliminate (as much as is possible) =
turbulence which occurs when air moving under the car buffers against =
air moving down and over the engine. Evidently, if you remove the rear =
engine undertray, the air pressure under the car pushing up buffets =
against the air moving down. Of this occurs at the bottom of the engine =
and up - and hence removing the tray causes substantial air turbulence =
right where it is least desired - around the engine. This turbulence =
substantially effects (reduces) the ability for fresh cool air to flow =
continuously over the motor and therefore removing the undertray leads =
to a hotter running engine not a cooler running engine.

Hopefully, I have done justice to his explanation.
