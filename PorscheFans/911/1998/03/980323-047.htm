I have accidently wiped Meguires Wetlook polish on the Gravel guards on my wide bodied Speedster.  Has anyone out there in Porsche land had any experience removing this from the plastic/rubber fixtures around the car.  Any advice greatly appreciated.

Also, a funny thing happened on the way to writing this email, my speedo  has started to only work for about the first 5 minutes of the car running, the trip meter/odometers doesn't work either.  It all works at the beginning of the next trip but will fail again shortly after.  The car has travelled 12 000 km's, is there anything I should check before making my contribution to my dealers swimming pool fund?.

Thanks for any advice.

1989 Speedster -Turbo bodied
