 season, but is there anyway that we can get any coverage without buying a
 satellite? >>

Yeah, the Fox sports networks carry it on a delayed basis.  Speedvision is the
only one to carry it live.  As an example, Fox SportsSouth is supposed to have
coverage of the Brazil GP on Sun, Mar 29th at 10:30 AM EST.  The scheduling is
market by market.  Try going to <http://www.foxsports.com/fsn/>, enter your
zip code, and it will take you to a listing of shows in your area, assuming
you have a regional affiliate.  Then check their schedule carefully for the
listing.  They had the first GP on when our local papers said there would be
women's soccer on!
