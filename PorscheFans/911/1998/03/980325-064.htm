Michael,

For once, Haynes actually is of use.  Look in Chapter 10, Section 15 (pg
247 in my edition).  The adjustment for the sunroof is done by two
knurled knobs
which are located under the front guide bolts - these are at the front
of the panel, parallel to the windshield, and are supposed to be covered
by a black plastic trim piece which slides off (I assume you have slid
back the upholstered inner frame of the sunroof and are looking at the
metal panel).  Take of the trim, and you will see two bolts on each
side.  Beneath them are the adjustment knobs.  Adjustment is a simple
process of raising the passenger side of the panel until it is flush
with the roofline.  Generally the cables should not need adjusting; try
this and see if it works.

Hope this is the source of your leak.  Good luck, and best wishes for a
dry Spring.
