For those of you interested in cheap Porsche manuals and parts lists, Porsche
dealers sell these in microfiche format for about $20-30 each using your
appropriate PCA or Excellence discounts.  This is quite a difference from the
$200-400/set for hardcopy.  You could probably buy nearly every one they ever
printed for about one what bound set would cost.

As it would be impossible to replace certain pages in a fiche, I don't know
how they handle the periodic updates although I suspect that there aren't
many/any updates for the earlier cars.  

Problems are at least three fold.  1)  Fische are harder to work with, 2)
fiche can be harder to see as the quality is, sometimes, not as good, and 3)
you need the appropriate fiche reader (Porsche and BMW - who also publishes
their manuals very inexpensively as fiche - have a slightly different format
than your local library).

A company named Autohaus Europarts in San Antonio (512-821-6152) used to
advertise used readers in various car mags for about $200.  I don't know if
they are still in business.  You need to tell them which fiche you plan to
read.

PS  Rumors are that CD ROMs are next.
