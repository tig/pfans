 I was wondering if there is any easy way to know if the belt has or is
about to break?  One post said the '!' light comes on.  My car has the vent
kit, but occasionally it seems the car has a little less power (probably my
imagination, the last time was after my wife took the PCA driving school in
it) and I worry that the belt has broken and that I may be damaging the
engine.  Last night I pulled a plug wire and started the car.  The
distributor cap seemed to arc from the point to the cap so I assume both
are working, but doubt this is a good way to test.  Any input would be
appreciated.
