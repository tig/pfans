Greeting All

It appears I have a problem.  I started my car this morning 
and it ran beautifully to and from work.  I started it later 
to run across town, and I noticed a LOUD metallic sound.  I 
opened the rear lid and could hear a loud metallic sound (not 
unlike a chain rubbing against the housing) coming from the 
rear right side of the engine.  I revved the engine a little, 
and found it to be RPM dependent.  

My question..Is this a partial failure of a tensioner?  I 
have an 83 SC with 98000 miles with carrera tensioners.  I 
don't know when they were installed, but I thought that they 
were indestructable.  I assume the tensioner went out and the 
chain is resting on the plastic guides and the slack side is 
rubbing on the case, causing the noise..  Any comments, 
questions?  I just rebuilt the transmission, so I'm broke.  
I'm REALLY hoping that this is not as serious as I think.  

I also need to have the car fixed ASAP, because I work 40 
miles away, and this is my only car.  I just sold the other 
one :(  

Thank You

Chris Jares
