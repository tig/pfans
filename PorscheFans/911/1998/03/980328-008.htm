Hello P-Fans,
I finally had to write.  I have a '77 911S Coupe 2.7L (mag) with 55k
miles that has a some what of a slight ticking noise coming from the #1
cylinder area.  This was verified with a mechanics stethoscope with the
strong "tick" over the #1 exhaust valve.   I checked the valve
clearance; it's right on.  I pulled the left timing chain cover and
visually inspected the tensioner area, found nothing worn or broken. 
The tensioners are original with collars installed.  I cannot seem to
zero in on the source of the noise.  I have a couple questions for those
who may be able to help.

1.)Is their any way to tell if a tensioner is going bad visually?  If
so, what are the signs.

2.) Could this ticking noise be caused by the valve guide(s) being worn
excessively?  Is there a way to check for this with just the valve
cover(s) off?

Different subject.

3.) There is a small light between the seats that indicates when the
heaters are open or closed.  The lens actually says ON and OFF.  Mine is
not wired up at all.  In fact the wire was just slipped under the
carpet.  I cannot find any wiring drawing for this light so my question
is: When is this light suppose to come on?  With the dash lights?  When
the heater itself is pulled on?

Any help on any of these subjects would be greatly appreciated.  TIA
