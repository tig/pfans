Ross,

36/36 is the factory spec for it's *aproved* 17-in. tires. I'm not sure
about the Dunlops standing there. At this ragged edge of technology
tires don't follow conventional behavior, so you may have to monitor
especially the rear tire wear/grip and adjust. The problem is which way?
The new technology means they do not follow conventional wisdom anymore. 

Andrew Warren sent me a personal post on his method to dial in tire
presssures for the street with a lot of road time and a tire temperature
gauge. If he's read this far, I hope he'll forgive me for reposting it
here. It looks like a chapter from a new book on care and feeding of the
Porsche habit...

Inflation settings for the street is an interesting topic... MORE
interesting, I think, than inflation settings for the track. 

If you're racing, it's all pretty simple (in theory, at least)...
You can find the right inflation pressures one of three ways:

    1.  Test a bunch of tire compounds until you find one that, on
        your particular car and on that particular day at that
        particular track, gets to its optimum temperature when
        inflated to somewhere around the middle of its recommended
        pressure range... Then fine-tune the pressures until you get
        the exact temperature profiles across the tire that you want.

    2.  If you're running race radials and (as is currently
        fashionable) you don't believe that tire temperatures are
        meaningful, use whatever trendy method was recommended in
        the latest issue of Grassroots Motorsports.

    3.  Take a walk over to the Goodyear truck and just ask them.

For street driving, on the other hand, you can't do any of that...
And you probably don't even WANT to, since the sole criterion for
track driving -- maximum lateral grip when hot -- is WAY down the
list of important criteria for street driving... You're probably
much more concerned with tread wear, tire noise, and precise "feel". 

Don't tell me, by the way, that you don't care about tread life...
My other (non-Porsche) car goes through a set of its OEM rear tires
about every 5,000 miles, and even _I_ think that changing tires that
often is a pain in the ass.

Anyway... The process I'd use to determine the "best" inflation 
pressures for non-OEM street tires would probably be something like 
this:

    1.  Start with the factory-recommended cold pressures front and
        rear (and start EARLY... This will take most of a day).

    2.  Drive ten miles or so, listening to the noise from the 
        tires.

    3.  Drive your favorite twisty stretch of road, paying attention 
        to:

        a.  How sharply the car turns in.
        b.  How quickly the car "settles" into a turn.
        c.  How easy it is to "flick" the car back and forth (as 
            though through a slalom).
        d.  How stable the car is in a straight line at high speed.
        e.  How stable the car is under the brakes.
        f.  How securely-planted it feels over bumps and washboard 
            surfaces.

    4.  Stop, measure the hot (well, "warm") tire pressures and write
        them dowm in a notebook, along with the results of your
        noise-and-handling evaluation.

    5.  Drop the rear tire pressures by two pounds and repeat steps
        2-4.  Continue until the rear tires are at the same pressure
        as the fronts, or you see an unmistakable negative trend in
        your handling evaluations.

        If you've stopped because the rear tires are at the same
        pressure as the fronts, continue to step 6.  Otherwise,
        inflate the rears back up to the lowest pressure at which
        they still performed well.

    6.  Repeat steps 2-4, dropping the FRONT tire pressures by two
        pounds per run, leaving the rears alone.  Stop when the
        handling goes to hell or you've reached 3/4 of the
        factory-recommended front-tire pressure.

        If you made it all the way to 3/4-pressure, continue to step
        7.  Otherwise, inflate the front tires back up to the lowest
        pressure at which they still performed well.

    7.  Repeat steps 2-4, RAISING the presures in ALL FOUR tires two
        pounds per run, until you reach a point at which the
        performance degrades.

        Drop the presures in all four tires equally, until they're
        at the highest pressures at which they performed well.

    8.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.  Go home, park your car, put your car keys
        in an envelope, seal it, and write on the outside:  "Check
        Tire Pressures".

        Go to sleep and let the tires cool down overnight.  The next
        morning, check your tire pressures before you even start the
        car... That way, you'll know what cold pressures give you
        the best-performing hot pressures.

I don't remember, offhand, whhat pressures I finally settled on for
the Yoko AVS Intermediates on my 914/6 -- the numbers are on a label
taped to the tire-pressure gauge in the car's glovebox, and as you
know, my 914's in storage -- but I can give you one interesting bit
of data that shows how widely the optimum pressures can vary among
tires: 

The factory-recommended pressures for the special, NSX-only Yokohamas
on my other car are 33 front, 40 rear.  When a friend of mine who
also owns an NSX switched to Pirelli P-Zeros, he found that they
worked best at 32 psi ALL AROUND.

Hope this helps a little...
