Brian,

I went out to the 'olemiss' site and saw the sound system you
mentioned.  Very nice indeed, although the positioning of the speakers
is not that different from a 993 setup (much nicer packaging, however).
I sent an email to Ben McDaniel who runs the site, and he referred me to
Lou Foubare at RUF Import Haus (561.743.3201).
Lou tells me that the system shown is not available as an add-on but
rather is built into the car in Germany.  Oh well, it probably would
have cost way too much anyway...

But maybe not.  Lou also tells me they are having a sale on RUF 'Yellow
Bird' wheels, through the end of March.  He quoted me a price of $2090
for a set of 4 wheels, 8x17 front and 10x17 rear, and is sending out a
picture for my review.  I know some of you have been looking for RUF
wheels and associated suspension mods (Hi Ross), so it might be worth a
call to see what kind of package he can put together.

Hope this is of use.
