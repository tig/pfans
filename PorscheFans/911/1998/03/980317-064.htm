Andrew,

The gauge next to the fuel gauge is an oil level gauge.  It should be above
the red line when the car is idling hot and in a level ground.  The next one
is oil temperature which should always be below the red line (of course)
mine never even gets half way there (outside temp here are about 30 F. or -2
C) not even in heavy traffic.  The last one with the numbers 1 through 6 (I
think) is a oil pressure indicator. The numbers indicate bars of pressure.
The manual says something about that the gauge should be above 2 bars at
idle with the engine hot and in ground level.

Yes, the oil should be checked with the car hot (warm) parked in a level
ground and with the engine idling.

I can pull my manual and give you more precise info if you want.

Subject: Oil guages on 91 c4, normal readings?


What would be the normal operating indications for my oil gauges, such as
oil temp, pressure. Also, I don't have an english handbook, it's german
which I no comprendo, what is the guage in the clock with the fuel guage?
I'm using Castrol SLX (www.castrol.com), I think its 10-30, anybody know
what would be the normal consumption of the oil should be ie how much I can
expect to lose say every 5k miles?
In the engine compartment it says you should check your dip stick when the
engines running idle , is that correct? Many TIA. Andrew.
