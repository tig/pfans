Hi Fans:

I have a '87 Carrera/3.2 engine with about 113k miles. The car's been well
maintained by PO's and me. It's always had synthetic oil-either amsoil or
castrol syntec(with routine changes @ 5000 miles). It doesn't burn or leak a
drop of oil and has been very reliable. The only perfomance upgrades on the
car, done by PO, are a chip, K&N filter and andial exhaust. The car's used as
a daily driver so I don't generally get on it too badly(ok-maybe once in
awhile. It is a Porsche!). 

I've read in B. Anderson's articles and book of very high mileage cars that go
over 300-400K miles before a major rebuild. Sounds too good to be true except
that even my wrench told me he has a customer with a similar car that beats
the crap out of it and it has 265K miles on it with no problems. WOW! 

I'm starting to wonder if I'm due for a rebuild in the near future. Any advice
on things I should watch out which would indicate that the engine's ready for
a refresh? What's the group's experience & how long should the engine
typically go before a rebuild?
Here's a thought-should I do an upper and leave the lower until after 200K?
Is a compression and leak-down test enough to accurately predict a necessary
rebuild?
Comments please.
thanks, Ernie
