Greetings guys (and gals..) I've been lurking and
keeping my mouth shut here for a while, being a 
Porsch -enthusiast- but not an -expert-, but this
subject is something I do know something about.

The 'air cooled' engines are indeed -mainly- oil 
cooled, as the majority of the waste caloric value 
of the engines output is transmitted to the oil for
cooling. I cannot cite any supporting literature in
the automotive area, but the engines that I work on
every day (aircraft engines) are 4 or 6 cylinder,
air cooled horizontally opposed (boxer) engines, some
with dry-sump lubrication and some with sump lube, and
the technical data for those clearly indicates that
-primary- cooling of these engines is oil, and 
-secondary- cooling is air-flow. 

With one foot firmly in aerospace, and another in Porsche,
I wonder how many Porsche owners realize that the boxer engine
is essentially an aircraft engine design, with limited
automotive uses. I also wonder sometimes why we do not
install some of the neat (and off the shelf) engine trend
monitoring equipment available for 4/6 cylinder aircraft
engines on our Porsche engines. Cylinder head temperature,
exhaust gas temperature, and cylinder cooling trend indication.
Seems like mixture setting, etc., would be -far- easier it
we could monitor the engine -while being driven-, and these
units are off the shelf and available. Take up about the
same panel space as the 911 clock. 


Just my 2 cents. I't worth what you paid for it!
