Mark,

I have a '77 S Coupe, also a WideBody conversion, that has a US '85 3.2L
engine (put in by a PO), so I know that the swap can be done.  However,
it is not a simple undertaking!  There is a very good, detailed
description of a similar swap on the Sacramento Valley region PCA site.
Go to their techincal section and you will see a listing for "Jeff
Kinder's Tech Articles from The Drifter"
(www.DerPorsche.net/jeff.htm).  This is a two-part description of the
process of moving an '89 3.2L engine into an '82 SC chassis.  Probably a
little more complicated for an earlier car (i.e., your '75).

Note that Jeff is the SVR Tech Chairman, and lists an email address in
this article.  By all means, see if you can get his advice before you
start.  Also, other list members have updated engines in an older
chassis (Dennis, you want to tackle this one?).  Give yourself plenty of
time, space and money, and then plan on those provisions being low by
50% or more!

Hope this helps, and best of luck for a challenging project.
