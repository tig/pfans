Not sure if it will help all that much as you probably get more noise
fromother parts of the car. I must admit I have not had much luck with being
able to
really hear my stereo well as the car is on the loud side.
If I were going to do it, I would apply it to the outer door shell (from the
inside) and use something a bit thicker (maybe 1/4 inch or so) or use the
ashphaltic type pads ( I have some made by Proform called Trunk and Floor
Sound Deading Pads which are self adhesive with some sort of gorilla
snot........)

I'd probably use the sound deadener pads on the inside, the outside is
sprayed withan acrylic anti chip/corrosion protection material (I think they
used Wurth or Glasurit), but it is quite similar to the OTO Overcoat
(Sikkens) I used on mine.
