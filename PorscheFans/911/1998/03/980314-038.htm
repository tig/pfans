Hello Porsche gurus-

I have an 83 SC with a stock motor.  I recently posted a 
statement about a possible tensioner failure.  It turns out 
that the Alternator pulley had broken or bent or something, 
so that was replaced. No tensioner failure! Thanks to all for 
their insight on the matter.  

While it was in the shop, I asked the mechanic to take a look 
at my oil consumption problem (1/2 to 1 quart per 400 miles)  
He did a compression test and all of that is fine (170-180 on 
all cyls)  However, the leakdown wasn't so cheery.  #6 was 
leaking 12% and #4 was leaking 9%, with the rest being in 
spec for 98,000 miles.  The car is also leaking a small 
amount around the #6 cylinder.

He suspects that either the valve guides or the rings have 
some problems, and the head gasket needs to be replaced.  His 
estimate was for $3000-4000 depending on what was wrong.  He 
can't tell without getting into it, since he hasn't been 
working on this car and doesn't know the history.  He said it 
could go as high as $7000 if he has to crack the case halfs 
and replace pistons, etc.  I don't know if this is high, but 
I certainly don't have this kind of money!  He said that any 
damage I may have is done, and I should continue to drive it 
until the car misses on hard acceleration (He estimates 5-10K 
miles)  

My question:  would it be worth it to just buy another motor 
to prevent a $7000 bill?  I think rebuilt motors are around 
$4000, so I would be more inclined to do that when this one 
gives out.  My shagrin about the whole thing is that I don't 
know that the motor I buy would be any better than the one I 
am replacing.  the other bonus about rebuilding my motor is 
that I know that the whole thing is essentially new.  Does 
anyone have any experiences/ideas?  I don't see a cheap way 
out!

Thank you again

Chris Jares
