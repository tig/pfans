That might have been me.  I cleaned mine up pretty nicely by bending a wire
hanger into a hook on the end, then wrapping a paper towel onto it and
taping it, making sure the end of the wire was well padded so as not to
scratch anything.  By bending it into slightly different shapes you can hit
most of the inside of the lamp.  Soaked it with Windex and it did the
trick.  Amazing how much gunk was in there.
