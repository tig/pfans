I've looked through my archives but can't seem to find anything or at least 
nothing I can say for sure relates to the problem my poor baby is 
experiencing lately.

The problem:
I've got an '82 SC which recently had a new O2 sensor put on.  Apparently 
the previous owner had decided the car did not need one (has a Cat Test 
Pipe) and removed it. The problem I experience when the O2 sensor is hooked 
up is that the car doesn't seem to want to pull smoothly from 1000rpms to 
6000rpms as it does when the O2 sensor is not attached.  Rather it pulls 
sluggishly up to about 3500-4000rpms and then it comes on liked a raped ape 
for the rest of the rev range.  It's almost like driving a 2 stroke.  The 
car also surges at idle from 800-1500rpms in a fairly static pulse (even 
when warm).

Could this be a vacumm leak?  Poor fuel Injectors?  Poltergeist activity?

Thanks Much
Eric
