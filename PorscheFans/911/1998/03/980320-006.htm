Hi Pfans,

I noticed someone was looking for high octane race feul.  Your best bet =
is to stay away from AV-Gas (aviation feul)  It may be high in octane =
and may do the job, but it also has chemicals mixed into it that are not =
meant for car motors.  Your best be is to go to you local 1/4 mile =
racing shop, or local dragway park.  Most of them carry race fuel, or at =
least can tell you where to find it.  It's usually 110 octane rate =
(higher than AV-gas) and is made specifically for car engines.  It's =
also about the same price as the AV-Gas and safer for your engine.  I've =
seen too many people lose a good motor that they put a lot of money =
into, because they were using AV-gas instead of the proper stuff.  I =
used to Race 1/4 mile before I bought my P-car so I've seen it a few =
times.  Hope this info was usefull.=20

Good Luck
