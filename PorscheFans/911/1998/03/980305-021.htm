Caveat:  I have not done this myself, just passing along information..

There has been some discussion regarding SC motors and the amount of HP =
that may be coerced from them.  Having n 80 SC myself, I like to hear =
about such topics.  I have heard of two options to get this kind of HP =
out of an SC based motor.  One is to install one of the Supercharging of =
Knoxville kits, either the Paxton or the Whipple Supercharger, guess this =
would end some of the arguments about what the "SC" stands for, anyways, =
the claim is roughly 300 HP at the wheels.
Option 2:  My wrench has a 3.5 liter based SC motor that has wrecked two =
cars so far.  He roughly estimates the motor has 300 HP.  The cars it has =
gone in so far were not properly balanced or braked.  Moral: proceed with =
caution.
There are probably other ways to get just as much HP out of an SC motor. =
These are just two I have heard of.
