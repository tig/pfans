     Hi Terry,
     
        Motor oil is of course appropriate for lubrication.  I forgot to 
     include in my post that I'm concerned about condensed water inside 
     that causes corrosion.  I was hoping that by coating the surfaces 
     inside with WD-40 that I might keep any water vapor from condensing 
     on those surfaces.
     
     I'm new to the 911 engine.  On other engines I've rebuilt, it was 
     possible to run the oil pump via an electric drill on a custom made 
     drive shaft down the distributor hole to lube the entire oil 
     circuit internally. I would do this just previous to firing the 
     engine for the first time so I'd have no "dry" startups.  Can this 
     be done on a 911 engine that doesn't have it's oil tank hooked up?
     
     Thanks
     
     Brian Mifsud
