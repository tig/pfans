My $0.02 worth:

There's only one I'd use and that's Meguiar's (funny spelling that
nobody gets right)

The Showroom Finish is $AUD19.95 here in Australia as are most of the
Meguiar's products

There's the Yellow Wax for in between polishes

There's also the alloy rim cleaner which puts the silver back into those
rims

I also use the Swirl Wax

My car is 19 years old and looks better than any other car around, most
probably because it's a Porsche and also because I use Meguiar's, and,
no, I don't sell it.  A friend who has a SLK Merc asked me what I use. 
There you go.

My method for cleaning my car - make sure no sunlight on the car then:

1. rinse the bodywork off using lots of water to hose off (gently) all
the dirt,dust, etc you can
2. use a big sponge and lots of your favourite Car Wash product and wash
all over - use lots of soapy water to dislodge all the surface dirt
3. hose off totally/completely - get rid of that soap
4. using palm of hand scoop away any excess water droplets all over the
body - don't forget under the nose, etc - any painted surface including
the whale tail if you're outward-going enough to have one
5. get a cotton cloth (a teatowel will do) and wet it then squeeze all
water from it
6. fold it into a flat shape
7. use it to apply the polish whilst the car is still wet using
Meguiar's Polish or Wax
8. rub it on and smear it all over - wringing water from the cloth when
it gets too wet
9. get another clean soft dry cloth (good quality towel will do) and rub
the polish up in a buffing motion all over the boy but this is not the
final finish
10. hose car off gently to wet the entire surface
11. wash it again using lots of soap (your favourite Car Wash product)
12. hose off totally/completely - get rid of that soap
13. using palm of hand scoop away any excess water droplets all over the
body - don't forget under the nose, etc - any painted surface (including
the whale tail if you're outward-going enough to have one yet)
14. get a chamois (soft yellow cloth that feels like sueude) and dry car
off - don't try to dry it completely - wringing the chamois out as you
go
15. use a couple of soft towels (very soft) preferably in a light colour
so you can see the left-over dirt/grease and dry the bodywork off,
buffing as you go
16. run the towel around the door trim, under the door, around the
engine cover on the inside, around the luggage compartment (trunk) on
the inside, etc - dry it off all over
17. that's it
18. you can do the wheels with alloy wheel cleaners and work them into
this routine
19. make sure the windows (front, side and rear) are clean inside and
out especially if it's wet weather in your region to provide maximum
visibility in poor conditions
20. drive out and "strut" down the highway - there's nothing quite so
eye-catching as a well-polished desirable high performance car
.
