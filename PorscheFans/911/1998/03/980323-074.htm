Luis,

Welcome to the C4. The 964 C4 is much worse about this than the 993
iteration, but that doesn't help you much. The understeer occurs when the C4
front differential 'locks up' under high cornering loads. This is a feature,
not a bug, and is under the control of the AWD computer with its G sensors.
I am told that the system can be defeated by keeping some pressure on the
brake pedal while executing a low speed turn. I have practiced this some at
the track and autocross, and I think it helps, but I am not sure how much is
the disabling of front differential lockup, or just the benefit of a little
bit of trail braking.

During this period, Porsche was working hard to tame the tail happy tendency
of the 911, and the C4 with its high G at low speed intentionally induced
understeer was a result of this.

If you can't live with this tendency, you will have to find yourself a C2.
This is what I will do sooner or later. I just hate to part with the fine
example of a 911 that my C4 is.

    OK, I have been posting lots of messages lately.  I had to stretch my
new Computer's legs.

    I bought a 90 C4 about a month and a half ago.  The car G forces are
impressive during acceleration and braking.  However,  it understeers
heavily while turning.  I am very disappointed with this problem.  My 93 325
sedan beemer can turn faster and pull much higher Gs doing so.

    My C4 has a very hard suspension which makes the ride pretty
uncomfortable in the Chicago area where the streets are full of pot holes.
I would expect it to turn much better than my soft riding 325 sedan.

    I tried different tire air pressures, etc.  Nothing seems to ease the
problem.  The alignment of the front end seems to be very good.

    Any comments?

    Luis
