Hi Pfans,

I looked at an '81 SC last weekend that seems to have been very well 
maintained in every respect.  Mileage is 80k.  The car has received 
a number of recent performance upgrades including an SSI ('74) heat 
exchanger and an Ansa dual inlet/single outlet muffler.  According to 
the owner, in order to accommodate this system, the catalytic 
converter had to be removed.

The owner claims the car passes emissions without the cat.  I didn't 
see anything that made me doubt his claim.  The original exhaust 
system with cat comes with the car.

Up until what mileage can I reasonably expect the car to pass 
emission without a cat?  I'm concerned that around 100-140k miles the 
engine will become worn to the point that the car will fail emissions 
and then I'll have to switch back to the original, more restrictive 
exhaust system or will be forced to opt for a more expensive solution. 
Is this a legitimate concern?  Is there a system available that utilizes
the cat but flows as freely as this "hi-po" system?

I realize there's no free lunch when owning a 17 year old 911, but 
I'm just trying to determine whether I'm going to be in for a very 
high dollar repair in the next few years.

Thanks,

Gary
