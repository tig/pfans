Joe, Pleae take a few minutes and check out my Page @ <
http://home.earthlink.net/~roger53/ > this will give you some answers 
in regards to the little ball in the Rec/drier

Gary, Some people have already tried the change to r134a and followed
the manual and have not been happy they did it. What the manual doesn't
say is that R21 and R134a have entirely different properties and the
seals and o-rings that contain R12 will not contain R134a. So the
Compressor seal will start to leak and your car uses o-rings to seal
each joint they
will each start to leak. But worst of all, R134a creates a much higher
head pressure than R12 does and Porsches are the car Least equiped to
get rid of high pressure even with R12. So unless you use a condenser
system like one that came with a car shipped with R134a you will have
problems.

Dennis, The A/C blower in a Factory '76 911 is totally separate from the
fresh air blower in the heater system, and they use totally separate
ducts to move the air around.

Any more questions E-Mail me @ roger53@earthlink.net
