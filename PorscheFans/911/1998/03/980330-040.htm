     Subject: Dash Lights Fixed on my 90 C4
     To: 911@PorscheFans.com
     
     A while back there were several postings from people having trouble 
     with the dash lights and buzzers coming on while driving down the 
     road. All of these cars were 964 or early 993 vintage. My problem 
     ended up being bad spark plug wires. I guess the built in noise 
     suppression resistor had gone out in some of my wires ( I could hear 
     the noise over the radio ) and was sending this noise through the 
     electrical system. Anyway I took a chance and changed the wires ( an 
     expensive chance ) and not only did this fix the dash light problem 
     but the car runs a lot better ( I guess when these wires go bad the 
     plug does not fire ). By the way I purchased my wires from German Auto 
     Parts who beat the lowest price I had found, they were very courteous 
     and had the wires in stock ( OEM type wires ). I hope this info helps 
     some of the other owners diagnose their problems.
     
     Thanks
