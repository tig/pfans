Joel has a clunking sound at the rear of his car he suspects is CV s
going bad, and asks:

Is there any way to check the CV joint without disassembly? I just want
to rule out any other possibilities before I start tearing things apart.

-- I don't think so.  While you have the car jacked up in the rear getting
ready to remove them you can check your suspension - sway bar if you
have one, shock mounts top and bottom, spring plate bolts, brake
calipers, engine and tranny mounts, anything that looks like it could clunk
if loose or worn.  I've never been able to tell anything moving CV s by
hand, but maybe someone has a more useful experience.  Actually, you
may want this to be CV noise, as it is easier to fix than wheel bearing
noise or worse things.

Once I do have them apart, what am I looking for as far as wear?

--  If they are worn enough to klunk, it will be obvious to you which ones
are shot.  Pitts on a ball or race, or grooves on a race.  I've never had a
broken cage, but that would be unmistakeble. Shiny wear you can't feel
with a fingernail is just fine.  

If it appears that only one is bad, should I go ahead and replace both
of them?

-- Well, you are going to be taking all four of them apart (what fun).  If
any look like they are not bad, why not just repack and put back in? 
Should be good for quite a few more miles.  And you asked the next
question.

And finally: what is a good (read: inexpensive) source for replacement
CV joints?

--Huh?  Inexpensive??  Call around to the Pano advertisers, see what
their prices are for your year CV s.  Actually, I don't think we take a
"Porsche" beating on CV prices.  When you have yours apart think of
what it takes to make one.  VW bus CV s are identical to the CV s on my
'77 except they have a different axle spline, and they don't seem to sell
for much less.

Hunt around on the PCA region websites, someone (Nordstern?) has a
good post full of useful tips under tech on CV s for 944s, which learning
is good for our CV s as well.

Have a  weekend of true fun.
