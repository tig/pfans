Brad,
  Hey, _I_ responded! I wish I saved it so
I wouldn't have to retype this but...
  I just put rag or paper towel around the fitting
after I've loosened it enough to unscrew it by hand.
If you want to get fancy you can use a vacuum
pump to suck on the fuel regulators/dampers (?)
located at the ends of the fuel rails, This should
let the gas drain back to the tank.
  I've never had a problem with fuel spraying in
my '86.A little leaks out when I remove the
line to the top of the filter.  Wire the line up so it 
doesn't pee on the floor after you disconnect it.
Perhaps your Alfa has CIS with higher fuel pressures? 
Or are you one of those hardy souls with mechanical
injection? I've never messed with CIS, I just know the 
pressures are higher than for Motronic.

P.S. Weirdest thing happened this winter. I came
home one day to find fuel pouring out of my 911 (engine
removed). Loosening the fuel cap relieved the built-up
pressure and stopped the flow. I would think any built
up pressure would relieve itself  into the charcoal
filter. Just a mystery...

I posted this a few days ago, but still haven't received any responses. 
I figured this was an easy one, no?

Rather than spray fuel into my eyes by just unbolting the fuel filter, I
thought I'd actually do this the correct way and bleed the pressure off
first.  On my Alfa this is just a matter of pulling the fuel pump relay
and bleeding the pressure off.  Is there a similar relay on the '84 - '89
911?  If so, where is it?

Thanks,
