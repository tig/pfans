I changed the oil in my 81 911SC in March 1997 to Amsoil 20W-50, using
the Mahle oil filter.  In one year, I put a little over 4,000 miles on
it, sent in an oil sample, and it was in great shape.  I just swapped
filters and plan to drive another year on this oil change.  I use my car
mostly for track events and an occasional long drive to work.  It never
sees a short drive and the worse it ever sees is if I just pull it out
of the garage to work on another car, which I rarely do.  I know most of
you will cringe at this, but I'm a total believer in oil analysis and
synthetic lubes.
