Neil:

Congratulations on your new C4 Turbo purchase. It sounds like you have
the right idea for this car. You and any Bugatti 110 friends you may run
with should check out Buba's MonsterGT in South Boghollow Maine. (Anyone
on the list know the tel#? He usually advertises in "Gelenda und
Off-Strasse") He can fix you up with dual or quad Bilsteins, skid plate
(W or W/O 'roo bar), roof lights and Catipillar springs. With enough
lift height tire size is of course no problem. (And besides, who needs
fenders anyway?) Go for it. I hear from some of the competitors in your
class that the C4 Turbo has more than enough torque to handle front-end
loader and even the smaller earth mover tires. (But check your rule book
first.) As for wheels, I prefer Bubba's Hummer replica kit, but if you
want to stay with a European source in keeping with the great Porsche
marque and more of a stock look, I would suggest contacting MAN in
Germany about a custom fitment from their class 7 truck line.  (I am not
an employee or paid copywriter for Bubba,  Hummer etc.)

Hope this helps:-).

P.S. If you ARE serious, l think the whole list will want to know what
you finally come up with. I for one have toyed with the idea of
"winter-height coils" for my RS America--something more modest than you
propose, maybe 10 inches of chassis-ground clearance. But I can't bear
the expense and trouble of corner balancing and re-anighnment on each
change-over.
