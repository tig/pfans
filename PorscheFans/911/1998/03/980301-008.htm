Tom, this is not unusual.  We have had Porsche go after one or two of 
the advertisers in our local PCA newsletter for using the Porsche names/
logos for commercial use without permission; the 911 and 356 seem to be
a bigger problem than the water-pumpers.  One closed business, others
removed "Porsche" from their business names, soome dropped advertising.

Did you know that a picture of your Porsche isn't yours to do with as you
will? (snip)

Now, the rest of the story. Porsche AG sicced its legal department on Brown
Trout, claiming it had made unauthorized commercial use of its trademarks,
namely, the car designs and the Porsche crest visible in the car shots!
Even though it didn't own the car any longer, it claimed that it controlled
the right to use the image for commercial purposes! I think that's outrageous.

I found out about this when Dan Lyons called to ask for support from PCA.
I'm not part of the PCA leadership, but I gave him some names to call. If
you agree with me, e-mail/call/write Fred Schwab, president of PCNA, and
let him know your opinion.
