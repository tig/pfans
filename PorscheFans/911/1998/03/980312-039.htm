I just finished installing new Bilstein sport shocks in the rear
of my 911SC, which came from the factory with Bilstein shocks
and struts.  I have new Bilstein sport inserts for the front
struts as well.  Related to replacing the fronts:

My car was lowered by the previous owner.  I have a feeling
that the large washer installed above the strut (housing?) may
not have been removed.  I understand this washer was designed
to keep the front struts in their operating range when the ride
height was increased.  I have read recent posts regarding the
procedure for replacing the front Bilstein strut cartridges
with new ones, and is sounds straightforward - will I be able
to determine whether the washers are installed or not during
the replacement, or does this require removal of the strut
housing?  If the latter, can someone describe the procedure for
this?  The description in Haynes is not clear to me.

Thanks,
