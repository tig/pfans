After writing about his own top speed experience, Peter DeMeester
inquired:

Anyone else out there with top speed experiences for comparable
911's?

Peter:

First, re your experience, I wouldn't assume you were doing 260
clicks/hr.  Porsche speedometers are notoriously inaccurate, on the high
side, often by as much as 10%.  However, your car should have a top
speed of over 150 miles/hr., as detailed below.

My top speed story:

In 1988, I ran the first Silver State Challenge, the 91.6 mile race on a
public road near Ely, Nevada.  I ran it in my essentially stock '85 Carrera
Targa (completely stock engine w/ 200 hp as compared with your 214,
some suspension work) that I had campaigned in the Porsche Owner's
Club here in So. Cal. in 1986 and 1987.  Since this was the first running
of this race, few people knew about it, so I actually finished 7th overall,
with an average speed for the race of 150.84 miles/hr (it took about 36
minutes to drive the course at this speed).  I felt this was quite an
accomplishment, since my car probably had a top speed of about 151
miles/hr.  This obviously means that I was flat to the floor for the entire
race, other than 7 S-turns in a canyon near the end of the race, for
which I slowed to about 130 miles/hr.  The guy who finished immediately
ahead of me beat me by only a few seconds, with an average speed of
about 150.90 miles/hr - in a BMW 750 iL!  He listened to classical music
on his CD player the whole way!

What a blast the whole experience was!  On the drive home, I was
cruising along and saw a car off in the distance on the horizon coming
toward me.  Always cautious regarding our friends in uniform, I slowed
down to what seemed close to legal speed.  I looked down and saw that
I was still doing 105 miles/hr!  That kind of speed really warps your
perception.  Even cruising home to L.A. at about 100 miles/hr was tough
- it felt like I was stuck in traffic!
