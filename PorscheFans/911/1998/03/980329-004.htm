You are learning fast!  Fun, isn't it?  You are basically right about
the body widths.
The Carrera flares are 8" front and rear, the Turbo/Turbo-Look are 9"
front and 11" rear (this is generally called the WideBody).  If you are
thinking of this '74 Targa as a track car, you might want to consider a
coupe instead due to greater body rigidity, though plenty of people race
Targas. You could always turn the Targa into a Cab (about $5000).  Also
remember that the '74 normal has less horsepower than the 'S' or Carrera
models for that year.  If the car is stock, you could race it as such,
or you may want to upgrade several systems (engine, suspension, oil
cooling) for track use.

In any event, you should have quite a stable of '74s.  You could become
the 1974 911 Porschemeister!  Just beware of the cost of maintaining
several pre-zinc coated 2.7 911's.

Good luck in your continuing pursuit of Porsche driving/racing.

1977 911S WideBody Coupe
