Does anyone know where I can find a wind blocker for a 1990 Cabriolet.
Porsche sells it for over $500.  I'm hoping to find an after market
supplier or a used one.

Also, the light on my trip digital computer included in the tachometer is
dim, but readable, especially in daylight.  When I brought the car to my
local Porsche dealership, they informed me that they could not simply
replace/repair the light and had to replace the entire tachometer at a cost
of over $1100.  Since I have an extended warranty, I had them replace the
tach anyway.  If anyone want to purchase the old tach/trip computer at a
steep discount, let me know.  Other than the fact the digital read-out is
difficult to read easily at night, it works fine.
