Hi,
I have decided about getting good speed rated tires on my SC, and not
worrying about All Season tires. I think I will drive my 4000 Audi in
the winter. Now my dilemna is my configuration. Right now my car has,
205/60/15 in front and 215/60/15 in the rear. With this combination my
choices are somewhat limited.
1) Mix V and Z rated (Yokohoma AVS Intermediates (front Z, rear V rated,
$414)
2) Buy Pirelli P6000 SportsVeloce Z-rated all around ($ 478)
3) Buy Pirelli P6000 H -rated ($310)
4) Potenza RE71's

With my current configuration, I have decided to stick with AVS or
P6000. However, the tire rep were saying that is hould never mix my tire
rating (i.e. Z in front, V in rear). How true is that?

Also, what would be the effects if I went 225/60/15 in rear or 205/60/15
all around. My choices are less restrictive and I don't have to match
ratings now. What about lowering the series to 55 or 50? My car is
alreay fairly stiff and I would like to stick with 60 series if it helps
any.

Thanks for all the help guys (and gals).
