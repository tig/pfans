I've had this problem before...
I think you're right on.  It sounds like a bad speedo sending
unit.  There's really no way to 'fix' it.  It's a sealed
inductive pickup sensor.  You probably need to replace it.
They're not too expensive (~$50).

If you want a brief procedure description, let me know.
