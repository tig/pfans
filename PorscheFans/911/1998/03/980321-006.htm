Hello,

I recently made the jump from modifying my 1994 Mustang GT convertible (daily
driver) to wanting to increase performance in my 1989 C4.

In a Mustang, a K&N filter is worth 3-4 horses.  Does anyone have any info if
this holds true on a Porsche?

Moreover, the Mustang magazines usually don't like the custom chips on the
market.  Despite the advertising claims, no big gains are ever really noticed
in the Muscle Mustang & Fast Ford 5.0 type of magazines.  The chips basically
bump the initial timing from 10 to 16.  Perhaps they make a richer stoich at
wide open throttle.  Both of these mods can be done mechanically on a GT
without a chip.

Are there similar low cost mods on a Porsche?  Can the timing be bumped up?
Do Porsche chips really give 10-20 horses?  Are they worth the money?  Is
there a trade off (more heat, poor idle)?

Is there a Porsche magazine similar to the Mustang magazines that offer info
on performance modifications?

Thanks for the info,

Alan
