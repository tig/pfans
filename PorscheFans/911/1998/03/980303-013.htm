Short:  1983 Cab for sale in Houston.  I'm not there.... need someone to go
and look at it, drive it, and give me their opinion.  In return, I'll say
"thank you".

1983 Cab, 7 owners (titles), 56K miles, been repainted black over red.  Dash
board is showing fatigue from sun, back window clouding in, and the engine
leak test was too (stress toooooo) good to believe 5,0,0,0,0,0% and when the
mechanic was queried he said " <duh>, I didn't do it, my xxx did it, I think,
let me dink, yea, was real low, perhaps not 0, but 1-2% is heard to see on the
dial, got it here somewhere, didn't write it down,...."   <duh> hello.  Could
be 100% up-n-up.  I’m just a bit cautious.  No reflection on the mechanic,
just a reflection on a person parting with cash.

83 Porsche:  I'm looking for a driver, not a collectors piece.  But not one
that I’ll have to turn around and put another $5K in tomorrow… next year s
okay J.    Repaint and re-sale value mean little (at this moment).  If the car
is solid, looks okay, drives well and it is a convertible, than I'm willing to
take the next step.  Money where mouth is....   fools rush in.. but this fool
is taking his time, about to not rush but crawl in…. (Something about owning a
Porsche…. Convertible….. not the whale-tale…..  but makes me feel good inside)

So, one step closer requires a volunteer.  Now, one caveat, someone from the
911 group actually sponsored the original ad for a friend.....so, "tag" you
can't be an objective viewer... okay, you could be "one" objective viewer, but
I'd then like a 2nd.

Okay... this lady lost the 91-944 cab because she procrastinated(sp), trying
not to do the same thing twice...

If your interested in the adventure.....  if enough people do it, maybe I
could sponsor a party while the group does the post-mortem on a conference
call.....or maybe just a thank-you.  Otherwise.... not...
