Hi P-Folks,

I would like to respond to three posts from earlier today.

To Chris Bennet:  Windward Performance (www.windward.com) sells the
Magnacore wires.  They were $129.00 for the set when I called them a few
months back.  I would assume that they would completely replace the
existing plug wires.  BTW, thanks again for the detailed brake pad
procedure.  It was a great help.

To Buddy with the 993 tt:  I have a recent issue of EC in which they
tested an Autothority modified 993 tt.  The kit is comprised of bolt on
components (they wouldn't say what except that it includes a chip -  top
secret, apparently), netted an additional 100 HP, and costs under $10
grand (around $8K if I remember correctly).  E-mail me your fax number
and I can fax the article to you tomorrow.

To Ken Ross who is contemplating the XJS purchase:  I share the same
sentiment as Henk on mid-80's Jaguars.  My dad bought an 84 XJ6 new and
had numerous significant problems with the electronics, the a/c, a
rusted gas tank, etc.  It was in the shop a LOT.  He finally sold it
after ten years (only had 60k miles - he didn't trust the car enough to
take it out of town much) and bought a Lexus LS400.  He says the Lexus
is everything he thought the Jaguar would be but was not.  To be fair,
Jaguars of the 80's vintage were notorious for poor quality control, but
that was supposedly taken care of in the late 80's/early 90's.  But I
can tell you, you couldn't run fast enough to GIVE my dad a set of keys
to another Jaguar.

Just my .02.
