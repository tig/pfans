Some one asked a few days ago about C2 wheels on a pre90 Carrera.  I
believe the differences are this:
16" pre 964 wheels have an offset of 23mm it may vary alittle by width
17" 964 wheels are 55mm for 7"&9" and 52mm for 8"
At a minimum you would need to add spacers and longer bolts to cover the
difference in the offsets (approx. 30mm).  That, I suspect would work
great in the rear, but the front would have the same problem my 91 has
with rubbing at sharp turns on the inside body.  In 92 or 93 Porsche
changed the steering limiters to solve this. I'm not sure the racks are
the same, (one is power assist the other not) so that factory remedy
might not work for you.  At the end of the day, considering the parts
and labor involved, this analysis would lead me to buy aftermarket
wheels with offsets designed for my car.  Just my $.02  Good luck with
your decision.
