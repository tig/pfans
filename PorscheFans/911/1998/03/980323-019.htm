Hi folks,
My 78 SC has a short shift kit installed by the previous owner. I have
noticed this annoying and potentially dangerous problem in my car. While
accelerating @ 2000 + rpm in 3rd or 4th gear, my stick shift vibrates making
a ticking noise. Now this does not happen under intense acceleration, but
during regular under 45 mph city driving. Out on open roads, under full
throttle this does not happen. I am sure that is not good for my synchros. 
I had my timing adjusted recently, because the car was a bitch to drive at
under 2000 rpm. My wrench think that it might have something to do with fuel
injection. Could the fuel injection affect it a low rpm producing some kind
of resonance in the gearbox?
Also, my gear knob, which has Porsche engraved on it, come off quite easily.
I know that they are supposed to be pressed, evidently this one is not.
Could I replace it with a Momo?
Thanks in advance.
