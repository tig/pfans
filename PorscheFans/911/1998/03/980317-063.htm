Dear PFans:

I just read an excellent article by Ed Hackett (edh@maxey.unr.edu) 
titled "More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About Motor Oil".  In the 
article he discusses Viscosity, Flash Points, % sulfated ash 
(sludge/deposits) content, % zinc (high pressure anti-wear additive); 
as well as data on the major brands, both fossil and synthenic.  I 
found the article at:  www.vtr.org/maintain/oil-overview.html  It may 
give you some insight that you hadn't considered, and help you decide 
which oil is best for you.  I personally use Castrol GTX 20-50 and 
change filter and oil every 2500 miles.  Haven't had any problems 
with my '91 C2.

I would appreciate anyone who uses an oil analysis lab to provide me 
with the lab's name and telephone number.  I'd just like to have some 
extra insurance that my chosen oil is doing its job.  Any assistance 
will be appreciated.

Lastly, I have a vehicle that I must part with that would make a 
great towing car: a '97 Land Rover Discovery-SD. It is a five 
passenger base model (still has power leather seats, cruise, tilt, 
A/C).  I leased the L-R a year ago for three years and have one year 
off of the lease.  Milage limit is 15,000/year.  The lease I'm in was 
a special program sponsored by the factory. I just completed the 
first year and the car now has 16K on the clock. Car is in great 
shape, and has had all of its services.  I change oil in it Q-3,000 
miles.  It also has a factory trailer hitch already installed.  I put 
$ down, and got the payments down to $399+tax/month (total is $418.
73/month).  I don't want anything down, just take over lease, which 
is assumable.  L-R leased through BMW (who now owns L-R), though Mid-
Western Auto group in Columbus, Ohio.  Car is located in Lima, Ohio, 
NW Ohio.  If you need a 4WD or a tow vehicle, give me a call or e-
mail.
