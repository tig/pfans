I need help.  I have a 1978 SC. The driver's  side turnsignal/corner 
lamp appears to be going to ground somewhere.  When I use the turn 
signal the inside indicators both flash and the signal is very dim.  
Both bulbs are new.  I took apart the light assembly and cleaned all the 
contacts.  I have not checked the turn signal switch as yet.  When I 
remove the corner lamp the turn signal gets brighter.  The socket for 
the corner lamp seems to have a short but I haven't found any loose 
connections.  My next step is to switch lamp sockets to see if this is 
the problem.  Any suggestions before I yank the wheel?			
									
	The 2nd quest I have is for locating the material that is used 
as filler in the rear seat bottoms.  Is this material available or would 
I be better substituting with a good firm foam rubber product?  The rear 
is rarely used.								
									
Lastly, someone asked about Toyo tires.  When I bought the car 2 years 
ago the po put new Toyo Z Radials 600 C1s on the car.  205/55VR16 front 
and 225/50VR16 in the rear.  I really don't know if these are good tires 
and the right combo.  I can tell you from my limited experience that 
they seem to grab the road very well in mild to hot temps.  The car 
seems to have more of a drift in cold weather.  I don't drive it much in 
rain but when I have they seemed ok.  I hope the input helps.
