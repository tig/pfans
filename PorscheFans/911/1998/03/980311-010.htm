Bob and others:

I still change oil, with synthetic, at 3000 miles although 7000 or 10,000 is
probably fine.  I don't know how much you drive your car but remember that oil
changes should be seasonal.  All the major brands of synthetic oil are
available in my local KMart and WalMart for $3.25 to about $3.90 a quart.

On the thread about synthetic oil leaking thru a failing seal or other hole at
a faster rate than nonsynthetic, I checked with the head oil person at
Valvoline and was told that this probably fell into the category of an old
wives tail.  At any temperature above about 40 degrees F, the viscosities (of
the same viscosity oils, such as 20W-50) are the same, within some very small
margin of error, and thus the leak rates must be the same and that it was not
possible for one to flow faster than another.  The two numbers in a
multiviscosity oil's weight (such as 20 and 50 in 20W-50) represent the oil's
viscosity under two different test procedures at a high and a low temperature.
The same test is used for both synthetic oils and non-synthetic oils so the
viscosity, or ability of the oil to flow is the same if the numbers are the
same.  As the oils are not tested at very low temperatures, thais where the
differences may occur and one area where synthetics shine.  Viscosity
improvers could be added to regular oils to improve their viscosities at these
low temp conditions, but who cares.  (Most of us have seen the Mobil 1 add
with oil from the Mobil 1 bottle flowing while that from the conventional oil
bottle comes out in globs.)

This Valvoline person felt that if those of you reporting faster drip rates
with synthetic looked more closely, you might find another explanation, such
as the synthetic not oxidizing as rapidly outside the engine.

Oh, and on Daniel's question of rerefined oils being used as factory fill, I
was told that the latest oil specs are written so that, indeed, rerefined oil
can meet factory fill specs.  Valvoline is not aware of any manufacturers
using such oil in new vehicles or whether any manufacturers actually endorsed
it.

And on Bob's question about Castrol Syntec using an old Mobil 1 formula:  Not.
