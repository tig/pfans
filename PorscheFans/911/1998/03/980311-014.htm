<<        Motor oil is of course appropriate for lubrication.  I forgot to 
     include in my post that I'm concerned about condensed water inside 
     that causes corrosion.  I was hoping that by coating the surfaces 
     inside with WD40 that I might keep any water vapor from condensing 
     on those surfaces. >>

I had a friend who assembled a new 911 race motor, and coated the inside of
the cylinders  with WD40 during assembly. He had to put the project aside for
about 6 weeks, and when he installed the motor, it would not turn over.

It turns out that the WD40 was too lighweight and evaporated off, and the
pistons attached themselves to the cylinder walls. The motor had to be pulled,
the barrels and pistons freed up, coated with motor oil, and reinstalled.
Fortunately, no permanent damage.

Another consideration is that WD40 uses propane as a propellant. (Makes a
great starting fluid). Is propane corrosive? I don't know.
