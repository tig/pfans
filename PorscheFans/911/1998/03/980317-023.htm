Ian,

Not sure the wiring is "exactly" the same, but it should be close enough

Ian,

Not sure if the wiring on the later style is "exactly" the same, but it
should be close enough to ianjohnson wrote:

Ian,

Not sure if the later style wiring is "exactly" the same, but it should
be close enough to easily figure out.

Would definitely recommend going to the later style rear lights (unless
you're doing a concours car), as replacement lenses are a whole lot more
affordable than replacing the (non-existant) rear sealed boxes.

Mounting points for the boxes are the same.
