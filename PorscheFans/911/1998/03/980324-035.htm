Hi Jeff,

I have a 320 Momo Monte Carlo.  I like it but don't necessarily see it
as an improvement over the stock 4 spoke.  The 320 will block your view
of  the top of the tach. including turn signals , the important part of
the speedo for street driving (betw about 30 and 75 MPH) and will
partially obscure your oil gauges.  You will gain a beefier feeling
wheel (with nice thumb pads) in the sense that it is bigger in the hand.
It requires more effort to steer but steering response is quicker (less
movement required).  You also get more thigh clearance.   I miss the
lighter feel around town and the little ribs on the back of the stock
wheel (didn't notice them till they were gone).

You can turn your gauges to alleviate the visibility problem.  You might
want to go to an AX or DE event before you make the change and feel one
in person.

All in all its very close to a wash for me .  Just my  $ .02.

I would appreciate hearing about your firsthand experiences w/the Momo
wheels.  What did you like or dislike about any particular model?  Is
350 mm small enough or is 320 mm better?
