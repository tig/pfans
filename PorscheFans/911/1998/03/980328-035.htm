Jeremy, don't consider myself an "expert", but have put close to 
300,000 miles on various 911's since 1976.

First I would ask is how much work do you intend to tackle yourself.
If all work is done by a shop; yes, they are high maintenance.  They
require valve adjustments, which is a several hundred $$$ job every
15,000 miles.  Then there are the 10 qt. oil changes.  Spark plug changes
are more difficlut (althogh probably not as bad as some US FWD 
trancerse V-6's).  Also parts run significantly more than for your neighbor's
 F150 pick-um-up, as you indicate (alleviated somewhat via mail-order).  
However, if you look at the maintenance as a hobby, it should not be 
expensive.  Work is not too hard, although might help to have knowledgeable
 friend  help you the first time.  Also, will need a shop manual; best are
from
Porsche but very expensive; Hayne's makes a good alternative.

Now, engines are very durable - should go 150,000 miles easily.  Suspensions
stay pretty solid, and don't require much maintenance besides occasional
front wheel grease pack.  Biggest problem in my experince is clutch/tranny;
I feel the 915 tranny used till '87 is weak,a nd cannot take a lot of abuse.

Have a good shop check over any potential purchase, and pick a shop
with a lot of 911 experience.  if you pick a car with a solid engine/tranny
and good body, you should get many pleasurable years out of it.

Good luck.

Hello all,
   Well, I am going to hopefully be picking up a car in about the next 6
months or so, and lately I have been stepping up on doing my homework a
little.  A family member talked to a german car mechanic at out church
and asked about a 911, since I have been talking about getting one for
ages, and the mechanics response was that they were fairly high
maintenance cars...although they didn't mention what kind of 911 I was
trying for. I am hoping to pick up a good 911SC with a solid service
history, and hopefully 100,000 miles or less.  I know such a car will
require it's share of TLC, and I am planning on taking care of it quite
seriously.  My first question is, would a 911SC really be considered as
a very high maintenance car?  (I know all of these cars have the
potential to be, as the parts aren't exactly inexpensive)  How has the
cost of ownership been for some of the 911SC owners out there as
compared to some of your other cars?  I want a good idea, as I am NOT
going to be cheap about maintenance on the car.
    If anyone cares to share your experiences, I would like to hear
them, so I will have a better idea as to what I am up against.  Thanks
in advance,

Jeremy
