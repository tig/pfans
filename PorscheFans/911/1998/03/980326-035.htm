   I have some unconnected wires lurking on the left side of my engine
compartment (not the wires to the non-existent rear fog lights). Recently, at
a free diagnosis clinic at the local dealer, I asked the mechanic what they
went to. He wasn't sure, but thought they connected to a temperature sensor:
"That one down there."
   Going home and looking through all my books to decipher what he was talking
about, I have concluded that it is the sensor that comes out of the left chain
housing cover (part nr 911 617 117 00). I also noticed that some pictures just
show a plug in the area where mine has a sensor. The wires I have look to be
one solid yellow and one red/black or brown/black (faded..it is a 78 SC
engine). The wires have normal female push-on endings, but the sensor has two
round brass "ears" instead of the spades you would expect. Now the question:
do these wires go to that sensor? And which wires go to which side? And do
they just push on the round ears? Thanks....
