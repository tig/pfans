The rear caliper lower bolt is indeed a pain in the rear end, so to speak. 

If the rear caliper bottom bolt is fractious, you want to apply liquid
wrench - penetrating oil.  This works best if you leave it over night to
give it a chance.  Also, the inner tip of the bolt sticks through the caliper
tab it screws into just a little bit, so with pads removed you can get a thin
tube to it, down which you can squirt or pour your penetrating oil to get
at another part of the assembly as well.  This will be close to the rotor
surface, so the operative word is thin.  And I didn't say this was easy.   
If, with the top bolt removed, you can force the caliper a little bit back and
forth, that might  help the penetration process, especially if you figured
out a way to get some fluid onto the joint between caliper and banana
arm.  Some people report good results by using lots of penetrating fluid
and even more patience.  soak, wait, soak, wait, restrain the bigger
hammer urge.  I've never tried to get heat in to that caliper tab, but you
might scope it out to see if you could get a torch on just the tab to heat it
up some, but since this is a part which gets fairly hot sometimes
anyway, perhaps heat will be less successful in breaking the rust
bonds.  Then apply torque.  The worst that can happen is that the bolt
will shear (not too likely, it's a 12 isn't it?) and you can then remove the
caliper and have nice easy access to the broken part, or can take it to a
machine shop.

 Good idea to put antiseize on caliper bolts to make next time easier. 
You can get a socket wrench and socket onto this bolt, which makes
turning it a little bit easier.  However, if you keep turning it out it will
capture your socket - you can't get the bolt farther out, and you can't get
the socket off.  So you can only use the socket for initial loosening or
final tightening.

You can get an offset closed end wrench in there.  It is slow, but you
have no options I can see.  I found that my wrench kept hitting its other
end on the spring plate or something, as it was offset the other way, so I
purchased a second wrench and cut that end off.

Good luck

big brake era)
