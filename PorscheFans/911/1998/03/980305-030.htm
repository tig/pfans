I have seen alot of post concerning the hp gains or losses with these
filters.  I have a K&N in my 1990 Toyota pickup and my 1981 911SC.  I
also have the luxury of unlimited use of a dynojet model 248 dyno.  The
test I did for my 911SC to see if the K&N did anything is as follows: 
First I made runs with a brand new porsche filter and then replaced it
with a brand new K&N filter.  The runs made with both filters did not
show a difference when compared using the SAE correction factors.  If
you look at the basic construction of the porsche filter and the K&N
filter they are pretty much the same, but the K&N filter can be washed
and used over and over.  Since a porsche filter will run you about $20
and a K&N will cost about $50 (prices from performance products catalog)
it makes sense that the K&N is a better deal.
	Concerning my truck I did the same test with toyota products and I
gained 6hp in midrange and 8hp on top!  If you look at the construction
of the K&N it makes sense.  
	I am not saying that the K&N will work better or worse in any other
pcar, but I think from a maintenance cost stand point it is a better
deal.

P.S.  DYNOJET in no way endorses my opinions expressed.  DYNOJET is not
in the business of validating or discrediting any manufacturers claims!
