Hi PFans,

I found the fix for my gauge light problem, but I'm not sure exactly
what I did that fixed it.  Bought a continuity tester and pulled the
gauges out again, taking out all 2W bayonet style bulb holders.  All of
these lead into a single blade-type connector, and all of the wires are
black with blue bands.  I unhooked the single connection and removed the
whole set of wires.

Connecting the alligator clip to the blade connector and the tip of the
continuity tester to each outer bulb socket revealed one bad bulb (a new
one, at that!), but all other bulbs were fine (i.e., lit up!).  Then
pulled the black/blue band wire from the ignition switch and connected
the clip to this and the tester to the single female end of the
connection.  Again, all okay.

The only odd part of this arrangement was a snap splice connecting the
oil/fuel level light wire with a blue wire leading to the fog light
switch, presumably to illuminate the switch face.  Opening the splice
connector showed that the points of contact were less than optimal, so I
enlarged them and made sure the connections were good.  Lastly, tested
the wire from the splice to the fog light switch, and it was fine.

Put everything back into place, tried lights, gauge lights work!  They
still seem a little weak; will have to wait until tonight to do a more
thorough test, but I can see the light at the base of each gauge.  YES!

I did this one on my own, but I want you all to know that it is your
collective sense of 'can-do' that allows me to embark on such projects
that I would previously have thought beyond my competence.  Many thanks
for being there, and I hope this may help someone else in the future.
