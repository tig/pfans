Drivers Ed - an instructional event at a race track, often sponsored by a
car club, designed to improve your driving skills. They are also a great
deal of fun once you get used to driving with the pedal to the metal. These
are NOT races.

Motocross - motorcycles on a dirt track. However, I imagine you were
thinking about:

Autocross - a course laid out with pylons on an otherwise wide-open expanse
of asphalt (like an unused runway or parking lot). Cars are usually run one
at a time for one or two laps and are electronically timed. Lowest time in
each class wins. Wonderful for learning car control and again mucho fun. It
is also the only truly safe form of auto racing (while weird mishaps do
rarely occur, it is much safer than driving on the street). No special
skills or equipment required, just show up and have fun (a helmet is
required, but loaners are usually available).

If not a member, join the Porsche Club of America (PCA) whose local regions
sponsor both types of events.
