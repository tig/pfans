     I would like to replace my engine and tranny mounts soon.  My shifting is
normally fine with the exception of 1st to 2nd under hard acceleration so I'm
thinking maybe with the suspension and chassis loaded like that the motor and
tranny are rocking enough to cause a baulky shift.  
     There seems to be three choices for 911 motor/tranny mounts:  stock
replacements, cabriolet (stiffer) mounts, or metal racing types.  My car is
used as a daily driver, several autocrosses, and a drivers' ed or two so the
racing units would probably be too harsh.  I'm leaning toward the cariolet
units because I like to try to upgrade whenever a part needs replacing, but
noticed when the Carrera Club Sport was introduced about ten years ago it had
the cabriolet units only installed at the motor--why not the tranny too? Has
anyone installed the cab. mounts all around?  Has anyone endured racing mounts
on a street car?
