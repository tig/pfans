Hi P fans:  This is in response to Denny Lindsey's question about Head Temp
sensors. I had the same problem a year ago. My car was close to 100K miles and
was running great then started the "bucking" Denny describes. I looked at were
the sensor was installed and decided to let my wrench do it. I cost me less
than $100 in labor and about $60 for the sensor itself. I probably would have
blown a whole day doing the job so I'm happy with my choice. the car ran great
immediately after the change. 

Best regards, Ernie
'87 carrera

Subject: Head Temp Sensor help

I need a little help with installing a head temp sensor in my 86.
After installing a Fabspeed chip the head temp sensor decided to
move south with out me. Coincidence umm maybe, weirder things have
happened.... 
Here's the symptoms if someone else ever runs across them......
During acceleration the car acts as if the ignition switch was turned
off then on really quickly. This usually happens about 3 times within my 15
minute drive. I was told what actually occurs is the head temp sensor
gives a "Go Full Rich" signal to the computer and hence the "buck" of
the mule. Anybody steer me in a different path ? wanna add some opinion's
Please feel free.......
Denny
