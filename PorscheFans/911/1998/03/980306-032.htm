I've seen this mentioned several times but have never
heard from anyone who has done it.  What methods have
people used to refinish the black targa bar cover and
how good were the results?

I have heard of powder coating but the details of how
to get the textured finish were vague.

I have also heard of spraying with paint, like Wurth
sells to match the finsh on the rocker panels.  This
seems temptingly easy but does not seem like it would
have the right texture.

I need to refinsh because the cover on my 83 SC is worn
right down to the metal in some spots.  It looks like the
PO may have tried to rub it out, or maybe it has just
oxidized severely over time.

Also, any tips on removing the cover?

Thanks,
