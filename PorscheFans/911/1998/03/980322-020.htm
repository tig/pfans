Should I be able to feel any suction in the vacuum advance (red) line?  =
There is definitely suction in the retard (blue) line, but I sense none =
in the advance line.  I tried at 3000 RPM as well as rev's up to 5000 =
and still no suction.  As you can guess, at these RPM's there is no =
apparent change in the timing as I disconnect/reconnect the advance =
line.  I think I should hear some change in the way the engine runs as I =
do with the retard line.  Am I correct?  If so, I suppose the line could =
have a leak.  However, if the line is good and there is still no vacuum, =
where does one turn next to troubleshoot?  The line terminates in a =
location where I can't see what's going on. =20

Any help or related experiences greatly welcomed!

Thanks P-Fans in advance.
