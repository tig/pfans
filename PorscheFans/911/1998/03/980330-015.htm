I have a 1972 flywheel/pressure plate/throwout brg/disk $125.00, 
The disk has a few thousand Km left (I would replace it) but the rest is
excellent.

A complete set of door panels/handles/etc (black) excellent. $150.00, 

I have an excellent 1973 911 Speedometer (MPH) for $125.00,

I have a pair of good used (repacked) axles from my '73 for $200.00
(that is the dealer core charge!!!...)
These showed only the slightest wear (polishing of the races only) 
I cleaned then out and repacked them using the original boots. 
They are put together the way they came apart and marked  (left inner,
right outer, etc) 
The best way to use them is to switch them over 180 degrees, ie left
inner to become right inner. 
That makes the "coast" side the driven side and the CV's work like new.

I also have a 2.4 engine that came from my '73 911T. 
It is complete with heat exchangers and CIS. 
It ran fine but leaked oil and burned a little at startup. 
It would need at least an upper end rebuild. 
I think it is worth $1500.00. 

everything is plus UPS of course.

**These prices are not firm and I will take offers on any or all.**
