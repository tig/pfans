I was driving my recently acquired 80 911SC up a mild incline when I heard
a metallic humming noise for about 2 seconds which originated in the right
front of the car.  It disappeared as mysteriously as it had arrived and
before I could investigate what had caused it.  My first thought was that
perhaps the car was too low and that a tire had been binding on the fender,
but no evidence of this could be found.  Could this be the sign of an
IMPENDING WHEEL BEARING FAILURE?  Since the original incident, I have heard
the sound on one other occasion.  This time I turned the steering wheel
slightly and the sound immediately stopped.  Anyone seen, or heard more
precisely, this before?
