Well I can't believe that I scared everyone from posting to the
911 digest as to make it so that the last couple of day~s digests
have been empty. So what's the scoop? I point a few people to the
list and state how great it is and they receive nothing but blank
digests.. ack.

I really need to start checking out the car for updated parts,
which I don't have paperwork for.

We discovered that I was mistaken when I said I had an oil cooler
in my tail, it's the AC condenser. Now the cooler under the front
trunk, very front of the car is definitely an oil cooler.

Also I do not have any type of cooler in my front fenders, either
behind or in front of the wheels. I do have an AC compressor
looking thing in the front driver~s fender behind the wheel.
I also have my power antenna behind the front pass wheel and my
air horns left front in front of the wheel.

I do not have any of the same Heater hoses or mechanisms under the
hood where my neighbors 78 SC has some stuff. My car does feel
like it's heating up when I put the heater on so there has to be
something. I do have the heat exchangers still on the car.

I'm still looking for the exact engine number to verify it's the
same block that came with the car (this will put the motor
question to bed). On my fan shroud there is a factory sticker that
states 911T/911S CID 163.9 Engine family (which if I'm not correct
states 2.7 liter, just don't understand the 911T/911S part) is
that T for Targa or turbo? As I think I recall there never was a
turbo model based on the 2.7? Recall; as in remembering the last
past month of things learned :)

Second is Brakes, what size was the stock 911 74 targa rotors?
Front and rear vented brakes. The rotors on this car are a pretty
good sized compared to my AWD Eclipse, which were also decent
sized but smaller then what's on the Porsche.

What size Sway bars, front/rear came stock on the 911 targa in 74?
I just ordered some and am just curious what the stock ones were
suppose to be.

Ummmm, books I need books (obviously! it's about time! darn that
guy and his constant questions! Someone pull that  guys network
connection!) I know I know :) I'm not a rich guy and some of the
prices of these books just make me say hmmmmm, then I faint...

So if anyone knows of some decently priced must have books please
help. Hey I even don't mind if it has a grease smudge or two.

Okay enough from me, thanks for being so patient and thanks for
the help..

Tory *sitting in Milpitas CA. wishing that the weather was nicer,
that he could wrench and not have to work, that Sandra (the woman)
wasn't pulling me to a house warming party this weekend and that
he could join in on Sat and Sun for the auto-x and hoping he can
make it to the April 4th cross* Blue whewwwwww!
