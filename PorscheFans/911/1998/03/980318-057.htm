I have used Dynamat. It is about 3/32nds inch thick. It is really dense and
does a great job of vibration damping. I am going to use that stuff from now
on whenever I do car audio work. I wanted to damp vibration in both the
inner panel and the outer door skin. I put several large pieces on the
inside of the outer skin and I covered the entire inner frame under the door
panel.

My '86 had thick sound deadening padding on the floor, over 1/8" thick. The
carpet was only glued on the inner rockers and the tunnel and I don't know
if this padding was used at those spots.

I drove a 911 with 1/2" foam under the carpets. I didn't like it; it was too
soft, although the car's owner liked it. A carpet pad would be firmer than
foam...
