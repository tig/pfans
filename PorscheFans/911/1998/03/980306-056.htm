Sorry for the non-Porsche bandwidth, but I couldn't
let this one go....

First, to Jeanne and Bob, congratulations on your engagement.
Always remember that the love you share is and always will
be of far greater importance than the cars you drive.  You
are very fortunate to own two of the world's great sports
cars in the '97 Porsche 993 and '89 Ferrari 328.  For your
reading enjoyment, may I suggest the December 1997 edition
of Smithsonian magazine, which features a cover story on
'The Ferrari Mystique'.  Likewise, the November/December 1997
issue of Classic Automobile Register has several articles
celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Ferrari marque.
Best wishes to you both.

For Andy Warren, thanks for providing the information on
the Ferrari discussion group. I will tune in to that one
just out of curiousity.  I have always admired Ferraris
and look forward to the day I will own one.  For now, I
like my 911 just fine.

For Dennis Kalma, who asks whether Ferrari makes any cars
worth owning, I would suggest you ask the lucky few who
have the resources to purchase even a modestly priced old
Dino, let alone a collectible such as the 1957 250 Testa
Rossa (or any of the 300 250-series cars made), or a 365 GTB/4
Daytona, or an F40/F50 anniversary edition, or a 512
Berlinetta Boxer, or ....    Better yet, go drive one.

It is perhaps worth noting that Stephen Cook, who advertises
his '84 Carrera for sale in the list above, who wants to raise
cash as quickly as possible, is doing so to buy a 1977 Ferrari
308 (check out his web site).  Go for it!  Or that Brian Buxton,
who routinely contributes very helpful advice in this forum (and
who has no doubt seen his share of very fine automobiles), lists
his cars as a Porsche 928, 930, and, lo and behold, a Ferrari
348ts (Brian, if this is your company car, can I work for you?).

Dennis, I'm sure your comments were made tongue-in-cheek, and that
your '75 Kremer, like my '77 3.2 widebody, is a fine car.  But
while your comments on things like fixing broken heater control
cables (see above in today's list) are very useful, save this other
stuff for flamers, and please be more courteous than to send it
directly to someone who obviously admires both Porsche and Ferrari
and who came to this list for help.

Namaste
