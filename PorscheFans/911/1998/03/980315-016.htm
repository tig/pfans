I have a '66 912, which currently has a 2.0 liter 911E engine in it. I have
symptoms pointing toward a blown head gasket, so I looked for another motor.
To make a long story short, I bought a wrecked '80 911 SC. The motor seems
to be fine, but my questions regard putting it into the '66 chassis:

1)      Should I leave the CIS, harness, fuel pump, etc. or swap on a set of 
        Weber 40s?
2)      I have a set of Triad heat exchangers and a Bursh triple glass pack 
        exhaust on my 2.0 liter ... will this work on the 3.0 liter?
3)      How much modification will I need to do to the '66 chassis to fit
the 915 
        gearbox?
4)     Which torsion bars should I use? I am not sure whether the current bars 
        are stock 912 or were changed when the engine was swapped, but the 
        car sits level.
5)     Is anyone aware of weld-on brackets to use the rear sway bar from the 
        SC?

Thanks in advance for any help!!!
