Yep, 4th weekend in a 911, and I couldn't resist testing her top speed. 

Waw ! Must have a healthy 88 Carrera. In no time I went through the
gears and took her to 6250 rpm in 5th : 260 km/h on the tachometer
(equates to 160 mph). The car was very stable and the wide highway bend
I took at top speed was not as scary as I initially thought it would be.
I got my fix, and it lasted the rest of the weekend. 

Now it is Tuesday afternoon, and I cannot wait to get home and drive the
Porsche again (For those wondering, I work abroad all week and hence
have to limit the P-experience to weekend days).

Anyone else out there with top speed experiences for comparable 911's ?

The less pleasant surprise was filling her up. 75 liters for 510
kilometers, which at 1 USD per liter equates to approx. 24 dollarcents a
mile for petrol (or gas) alone... . The Belgian government is surely
getting rich due to my craving for fast cars.

Happy motoring, and drive carefully.
