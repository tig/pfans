Two Questions;

1)  Finally got tired of getting wet on every rain and broke down and got
new front Windshield frame seal. Amazing how expensive rubber can be..  Any
hidden gotchas in this removal and installation?

2) This one is driving me nuts!  When the engine is cold it is a real bear
lately to get it started.  Throttle lever pulled all the way up ( set so
after it does fire cold will run at about 2200 to 2500 rpm.) First cranking
engine will fire up run for about 2 5 seconds then die out.  If I even
touch the throttle pedal it dies immediately. Next crank a micro second of
run. next couple of cranks almost nothing.  When It finally does catch and
run it is very rough with minorburps of backfire.  Runs very unevenly for
about 2-3 miles with chugging on acceleration.  When temp gauge finally
moves slightly off the 120 mark seems to run fine with the exception of a
rapping sound on hard acceleration and same sound on the first start from
1st gear.

Just replaced the fuel pressure accumulator which was leaking.  Hoping this
would be the root cause from a low or incorrect fuel pressure...wrong. New
plugs in last 2 months, ignition wires all fine, timing seems ok.  Hopeing
to get under car this week end to adjust valves which sound slightly out
but nothing major.

Any ideas?  Aux Air Valve? how test? Cold start valves? How test?

TIA
