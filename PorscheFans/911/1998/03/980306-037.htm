911 Owners, you're the first to know-about our latest products

Get the hot, new look of Blue Star litronic lighting
Car manufacturers are dolling up new cars with expensive blue tint
lighting. Now you can give your Porsche the expensive litronic look with
our Blue Star quartz bulbs-without having to pay the $1,400 that some
charge for converting your lights to litronic. At night, your car will look
like it is running expensive litronic lighting, and all you did was take a
few minutes to simply swap your standard quartz bulbs for our Blue Star
blue tint quartz bulbs. NOTE: Blue Star quartz bulbs give the same
illumination as standard quartz bulbs, but do not give the power of
litronic lights. Blue Star bulbs priced individually, and sold for off-road
use only.
H1 12-Volt, 55 Watt	            QB-102B	    $9.98
H3 12-Volt, 55 Watt	            QB-302B	    $9.98
H3 12-Volt, 100 Watt	          QB-303B	    $11.98
H4 12-Volt, 55/60 Watt	      QB-402B	    $14.98
H4 12-Volt, 55/100 Watt	    QB-408B	    $17.98


Step up to a new level of cornering and excitement
Get a dramatic increase in steering and suspension feedback, quicker turn
in and precise cornering. Weltmeister's new CamberPlates replace soft top
strut rubber bushings with precision spherical bearings. Moreover, the
lightweight aluminum CamberPlates are machined with two sets of mounting
holes, providing you with a wide range of camber possibilities.

You can get far more negative camber, so you can take full advantage of the
latest super-sticky race and street tires. Bolt-in installation requires no
body modifications. Fits all 911, 911 Turbo, 912 1969-89; and all 914. Fits
all Bilstein and Koni shocks. Installation requires front suspension
realignment. (See photo on our Web page - http://automotion.com)

------------------------------
911 Owners: Step up to improved tire grip and quicker cornering with one of
the optional strut cross-brace kits. (CamberPlates do not work with the
Weltmeister Cambermeister strut brace [CM-1000]). The optional strut
cross-brace kits are in testing and available in 30-60 days; both easy to
bolt in and can be added later in 30 minutes or less.

The standard cross-brace kit uses a solid 6061-T6 aluminum cross bar.
The deluxe cross-brace kit provides ultimate strut tower strength for
improved corner turn in and maximum tire grip. This bar is made from thin
wall titanium that is cold formed to provide 60% greater strength than
steel yet weighs 55% less than a tubular steel or solid aluminum bar.
Moreover, the fatigue life of the titanium cross bar is three times longer
than a steel bar, and 5 times longer than an aluminum bar. Step up to
improved unmatched cornering and longevity.

Engineering details are being completed on the cross-brace kits and they
should be available in 60-90 days. Order now to be sure you are one of the
first to get this handling advantage. These cross-brace kits work only with
the Weltmeister CamberPlates (CM-1300).

CamberPlates Kit, 911 1969-89, 914, pair	                CM-1300	   $449.98
Standard Strut Cross-Brace Kit, 911 1969-89 only	   CM-1315	   $179.98
Deluxe Strut Cross-Brace Kit, 911 1969-89 only	      CM-1320	   $449.98
