HSR is a for profit organization.  The more cars that race, the more money
that Joe Pendergast and his family make.  Simple as that.  SVRA, on the other
hand, plays by the vintage rules and may not even allow your car to race if it
doesn't have the right racing history.  Many of the HSR cars are cars that
were not originally race cars but were recently converted, using 1990's
technology.

Participation in either group can require some cold $$$.  You probably noticed
that there are lots of Minis and Sprites and Midgets.  I've seen asking prices
ranging from $10K to $35K for a Mini so....
