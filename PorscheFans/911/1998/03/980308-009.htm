David,

I agree with Bob Tindel's recommendations in general regarding petroleum

jelly and wax application; however stains on the anodized sections of
the wheel
can present a more difficult problem.  Another source to consider can be
found
on the PCA Oregon region web site (address:
www.triax.com/orpca/index.html).
Look under the Library option and scroll down to Concours.  This has a
listing
for 'Care and Feeding of Your Wheels' by Larry Reynolds of Car Care
Specialties, Saddle Brook, NJ (201.796.8300).

Larry also has a series of articles on cleaning your paint, care of
leather and vinyl, and chip repair.  These used to be accessible via
the PCA NorthEast region site, but the links are no longer functional.
You might try emailing Car Care Specialties at carcaresp@aol.com to see
if those articles are still available.  I found them very educational
regarding glazes, compounds, and waxes (for paint) and cleaners and
conditioners for leather/vinyl.

If all else fails, you can consider refinishing at places like Rennsport

in Georgia (www.rennsport.com, 770.992.9442) or Wheel Enhancement in
California (www.wheelenhancement.com, 310.836.8908).  Prices range from
$500 and up.  Wheel Enhancement also takes trade-ins.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
