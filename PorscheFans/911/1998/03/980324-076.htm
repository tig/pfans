Hello all out there,
I've been looking into the 911's and decided to ask inquire about the 
930.  So in that respect,I have a few questions about the 930 for you.  
I've heard that Porsche brought them here to the U.S for a couple of 
years during the seventies, stopped for a while, then brought them back 
during the eighties.  Why did they do this?  Are there significant 
differences between the P cars from the two decades?  If so, what?  
Where would I find a 930 prior to 1985 and how much would it cost?  Is 
there any other 911 that has better handling and power than the 930 
before 1985?  If you would like to share your knowledge, please mail 
directly or to the list at dantissimo@hotmail.com
Thanks in advance,
David
