Forged 3-pc design, $575 each new.  Very good quality. Sold under Etoile
name now. I ran a set of 17x8 and 17x9 on my ex-944T.  Improved         
the looks and handling over the phone dials.  These were the 5-spoke
polished 
design.  If you don't get center caps, you can get a machine shop to
turn down 
stock Porsche center caps to fit.  I paid ~$35 including polishing.
