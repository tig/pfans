I've used the AJ USA kits for two years. One the plus side they are very 
effective at scooping large gobs of air and feeding same to rotor area. I 
never had any brake fade after a track day with them on, but usually had a 
soggy pedal without them. They are invisible when mounted correctly, just 
dipping their lip into the slipstream under the car.

On the minus side they are a couple of hunabucks for the pair plus hose and 
they are *not* invulnerable. On my lowered C4 I've wiped out three of them 
in normal driving, mostly after a high speed bump (parking lot heave, not 
expansion joint) causes the car to drop on the springs just enough to catch 
a lip of the scoop and tear it loose from the arm.

The scoop attaches with cable ties so if they get hit they breakaway clean 
but, held by the hose, it will drag along the road (clatter, scrape) until 
you can pull over and remove it. (Keep short screwdriver that can fit to 
the hose clamp and wire snips for the ties in your toolkit).

Net net - very effective but don't last forever on my car. I'll be getting 
another set this year.
