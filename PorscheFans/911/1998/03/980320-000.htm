George:

911 engines have TWO timing-chain tensioners, not one... And your
engine already has the hydraulic type, so you don't have to worry 
about them.

You do have to worry about something else, though... YOUR car's
classic problem is that ozone builds up inside the distributor and 
eventually weakens the belt which ties the two distributor-halves 
together.  When the belt breaks, it's pretty expensive.

Fortunately, Porsche sells an inexpensive kit that prevents the
problem by venting the distributor... Make sure that your car has
had the distributor-vent kit installed.
