Buddy  <OU812HAHA@aol.com> asked :

>>Also
any recommended horsepower upgrades? I am installing
new exhaust, looking for reprogrammed computer or 
bigger turbos, etc...  how about headers?  Let me know. <<

I am usually not keen on these upgrades but here's
some info. A friend has the latest Autothority upgrade
where they fly two people out to your car to install the
kit on your 993 turbo. It is supposed to be like 500HP.

My friend with the TT had a TurboS last year and this
is his 3rd 993 turbo so he has a pretty good feel for them.
This one with the mod kit is so fast it breaks the wheels
(all 4) nearly loose in 2nd gear. It gets up to 125 MPH
on an entrance ramp before hitting the highway.
Anyway he is very impressed, for only a bit (relatively)
more than the turbo it seems significantly faster than
the crazy $$ turbo S. I usually can't believe these
claims but this one may actually work... Anyone else
know about these mod kits?
