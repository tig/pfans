Not even the venerable Porsche brand name has been able to escape my
lack of luck with
alternators (last time it was with Alfa Romeos).

About a month ago I was going along in my (new) 82 SC...hit a minor bump
in the road and
all of a sudden my alt light and OXY sensor light went on.  I drove the
car back home.   So far,
I pulled the alternator, took it to a shop, they said 3 diodes were bad.
They replaced the whole
rectifier unit and also replaced the regulator for good measure.  They
bench tested it with a load
and produced 90% of its max rated amp capacity (80 amps).  Fine.
Reinstalled the alternator
back into the car  (yes, not an easy job), started it up, no charge!
(that is, tested battery voltage with
car running - 12.4V). The battery is new.

My current theory is that there is a short on the D+ (blue wire running
to alt charge light).  Could this
cause the alternator to not charge?  Or is it that the short blows the
diodes - and hence I blew the diodes
again?

I removed the alternator again, am going to have it bench checked again
today.

In the mean time, any help/advice is greatly appreciated.
