Yesterday I picked up the latest copy (April) of the English "Classic & 
Sport Car" magazine at Heathrow.  It has a 38 page trivia review of Porsche 
in alphabetical order, covering cars, people and all sort of fun and 
interesting stuff.
Amongst those, some additional insight on the aeronautical side of Porsche, 
and I quote from the magazine:  "Aero engines featured in Ferdinand's 
[Dr."Ferry" Porsche's father] 1917 doctoral thesis.  His 100hp 
Austro-Daimler six powered an airship in 1908 and he designed engines of 90 
to 350hp during WWI, including an air-cooled flat 4.  In the 30's he 
produced an X32, a V16 and a 44-litre (!) engine of 1000 bhp [these were 
for tanks, by the way], then a sailplane adaptation of the VW in 1943. 
 1959 brought a series based on VW's 1.6 litre four.  These ran dual 
ignition and produced 52-75bhp.  In 1983 the PFM 3200, a 210hp version of 
the 911, used dual plugs and electronics and cogwheel cam drive.  This took 
a Mooney aircraft around the world, but never found enough buyers."
I also learned that there were a number of other airplane engines over the 
years, including one for the Cessna 182 in 1984.  This engine was a 
standard 911SC flat 6 but with double electronics, including plugs, and 210 
i.o. 230hp (I guess due to lower compression) all required for 
certification purposes.
On the "heavier" side of things, there was the WW2 Ferdinand 68 ton mobile 
anti tank gun, the infamous Maus (mouse), the world's largest tank ever at 
188 tons (it had to be able to handle 10ft of water as most bridges could 
not carry it) and many, many Kubelwagens (the open-topped cross country 
beetle) that formed the foundation of the German army during WW2, including 
variants such as the Typ 87 and Typ 128, the Schwimmwagen.
I guess nobody's perfect ... and let's not forget that Professor Ferdinand 
Porsche was not the founder of Porsche, it was his son Ferry, bringing fame 
and fortune to the family and neat toys to the rest of us.
