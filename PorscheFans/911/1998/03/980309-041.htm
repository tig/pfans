Hi, Dave,

I had a similar problem before going down to Rainbonnet in Portland last
year. I knew the tire had a plug in it (I'd only recently bought the car,
so the plug had been put in by the previous owner).

The local P-shop advised that the plug WAS installed correctly (double
patch - a plug and a patch on the inside), and it should be safe for
Driver's Ed.

At Rainbonnet, I was at a tire tech session given by someone from BF Goodrich.
I asked about doing Driver's Ed with a patched tire - this kicked off a
discussion about tire construction and what happens when a tire is damaged.
This discussion reluctantly convinced me that it was not safe to put the
car on the track with the plug in the tire. 

Now, the fellow from BFG might have had an ulterior motive to sell more
tires, but I don't think so. The basic notion is that you DON'T KNOW what
part of the tire's internal construction has been damaged by the nail (or
whatever). Also, the steel in steel belted tires is coated with something
(copper? I forget) because steel does not bond properly to rubber. A nail,
etc, could easily scrape or chip off some of this coating and lead to
the start of a tire delamination.

That's probably a REAL worst-case scenario - I.e., probably HIGHLY unlikely,
but I chose not to risk my car and myself. The BFG tech guy's comment was
that you could certainly try running your car with a patch/plug, but you'd
never catch him as a passenger in such a car.

So, I reluctantly skipped the driver's ed event. I autocrossed instead and
had a blast...

Cheers,

Ross
