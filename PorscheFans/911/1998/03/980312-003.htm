======================================
Not too long ago my thermostat was leaking at the fitting.  I thought about
trying to do th work myself - but i did not have the appropriate wrenchs.
As it turned out my mechanic had to actually remove one of the oil lines to
be able to have enough work work space to remove the line.

It problem turned out to be due to dissimilar metals, i.e., the thermostat
is aluminum while the oil linee fitting is steel and the treads can get
ruined during dissassemblies.

My advise is to buy the special couplings that all the catelogs sell and
put them on when you install your new unit.  (The couplings have both male
& female threads so you attach them to the thermostat & then attach the
hoses to the couplings.)  Then if you ever need to disconnect the
thermostat you can disconnect it at the coupling and won't ruin the threads
on the thermostat.
