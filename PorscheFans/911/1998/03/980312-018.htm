Hello to the PFans!  

I'm new to the world of Pcar ownership and have been following the list in
Digest form since I bought my '90 911 C2 Cabriolet in December.  Your
conversations have helped to shorten the ugliness of a winter where all I can
do is look at the pretty white car as she sits in my garage!

Now, on to the question at hand....

My wrench says that I will soon need new brake pads all around (he says they
are  down to about 4mil each).  Quote: $400.  

I'll be using the car for a daily driver and "maybe" a couple of autocrosses
just for fun.  What kind of brake pads do you reccommend?   Can I do the job
myself?  I've never tried this job before.  Any special tools needed?  Do the
wear sensors need to be replaced too?

Other than the brake pads my wrench (the local Porsche Dealer) says the car
(which I purchased from a private party) checks out perfectly.  She has 36K
miles and nary a scratch on her!

TYIA.
