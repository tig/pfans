Hi,

There has been some discussion recently on high milage
Porsches and specificly regarding 3,2l engine.

I opened my 3,2l after about 120.000 miles because #6
leakdown & low compression. All other cylinders had
good leakdown and even compression. =

Only other indication was a slight valvetrain noise &
slightly fouled #6 plug.

Reason for leak & low compression was because of
excessive wear on #6 exhaust valve guide and because
of this the valve seat was leaking. =


However all other guides was also shot, but no =

indication in leak down & compression test.
Or this I can judge when I check the repaired engine.

My  engine has been open before, don't know why, but
bearings was original based on date stamps in them.
Conn. rod bearings was worn out, mains was fine.
No low oil pressure. =


Everything else was A OK, reason for worn bearings
might be neglected oil change? Internally the engine
was very clean, no sludge, but these new oils (Mobil 1)
propably clean the sludge if any.

What I want to say:
- Do not blindly believe in leak down & compression test.
- Pre-purchase inspection by a good mechanic is very vise. =

- Valve guide vear should perhaps be checked visually.

PS.     Like Porsche say: not something for everybody,
        but everything for somebody. I only regret that
        I did not buy a Porsche earlier.   =
