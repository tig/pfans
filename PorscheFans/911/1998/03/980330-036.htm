I received a lot of mail from people interested in a comparison of the Yoko
A032R's vs. the BFG R1's that I used previously.

My reason for switching is this, I bought two sets of R1's for track use. 
Both sets came from the same "batches" according to Tire Rack.  After one
day on the first set, the sidewalls were starting to come apart.  There was
a large crack around the entire sidwall where the sidewall is bonded to the
tread (BFG told me that this is where the bond is).  They told me that I
ran the wrong pressures or didn't heat cycle the tires properly.  I don't
think so, as this was my 4th set of R1's with no previous problems.  So I
scrapped set #1.  They would do nothing for me.

Enter set #2, same thing.  Scap after 1 day.  Still my fault.  I could not
even get BFG to call me back about the problem.  I also received mail from
others with R1's with similar problems and had purchased their tires in the
same timeframe.  I figure the tires cost me about $130/hr to run.  My
opinion is that BFG had a bad batch of tires and I paid for it.

I could not open my wallet to give BFG any more business without
considering other brands.  So I looked for other alternatives.

My requirements were a good track tire, that is a decent street tire with
good wear ratings (I drive to the track with them on).  Good rain
performance was considered a bonus.

Now the comparison:

1)  Price
They are about $5 more per tire than R1's for the sizes I bought.
205/55/16
225/50/16

2)  The Yokos seem lighter
After carrying wheels with R1's in to the shop for mounting, and carrying
them out with the A032's, I can say they are noticably lighter.  I don't
have hard numbers, but I'm sure they are lighter.

3)  Much nicer ride for street than R1's
They are not harsh like the R1's.  Of course, there is a probably a
peformance trade-off here.  They do not turn in as quick as R1's.  But they
do feel good.  If the wear rate is good, I will use these tires as my
street tires as well.

4)  Noise
They make a sort of odd moan that you can hear with the windows down.  I
did tons of work on my car between mounting them and trying them.  I
thought I screwed something up when I heard this noise, but I'm sure it is
the tires.  It's a sort of noise like running agressive off road tires on a
4x4 and driving it on the street, if you know what I mean.  Not real loud,
but you can hear it.

5)  Looks
I think the sidewall looks much nicer than the R1's.  Doesn't matter to me,
since they are for the track, but to some it may be a major consideration
if they are to be used primarily as street tires.

6)  High speed stability
I took them up to about 120 mph.  It was fairly breezy.  They felt fine. 
No vibrations or anything like that.  They didn't pull hard when hitting
grooves in the road.  Haven't taken any turns at that speed, so I can't
comment yet.

7)  Hard braking
I hit the brakes pretty hard several times to bed in my new pads.  No tire
squeal or lockups or anything like that.

I have about 100 miles on the tires so far, so I have not pushed them at
all as they are still breaking in.  I will take them to LRP this weekend. 
I will post another message with my thoughts after a weekend of high speed
driving.  So far, so good.
