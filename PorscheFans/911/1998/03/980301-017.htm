I have been using radar detectors since 1985.  Escort, Passport, Uniden a=
nd now =

Valentine.  The late 1980s vintage Escorts have better false filtering th=
an the current =

generation of $150 detectors.  The Uniden was a gift and I threw it out b=
ecause it =

falsed all the time.  The Valentine is incredible.  Based on tests I read=
 and my =

observations as an owner, I would say that the Valentine's range is doubl=
e that of any other =

detector.  I also agree with the tests that it falses just as often as th=
e other models =

available.  Where the Valentine excels is that it shows you where the sig=
nal is =

emanating from, thus you can quickly dismiss most signals as false.  This=
 feature is too =

awesome to describe with words and ends the anxious miles of slow speeds =
that I =

would endure with my previous detectors to ensure that the signal I recei=
ved was not a =

trooper waiting for me ahead.  The Valentine is nicely made like the olde=
r Escorts were =

made.  The case is cast magnesium if I recall.  Needless to say, I didn't=
 tell my wife how =

much the unit cost until she saw how beautifully it operates!  Valentine =
offers a 30 day =

money back guarantee.  I am not affiliated with Valentine -- just a happy=
, techno gadget =

freak!
