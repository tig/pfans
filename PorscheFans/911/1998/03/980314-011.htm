The old-timers generally will tell you to forget it, but Porsche has added
spacers (and now, adapters, the ones with the studs pressed in) to their
street cars, so who knows best?

You can get adapters in a huge range of thicknesses from 14mm on up.
Troutman sells high quality adapters (800) 356-9307, as do my clients,
Automotion (800) 777-8881 and Wheel Enhancement (310) 836-8908.

Adapters are easily self-installed and reversible--that is, you can take
'em off in minutes. With conventional spacers, you will have to have all
your wheel studs knocked out and longer ones pressed in. It's something you
can do yourself, but it takes nerves of... titanium to pound studs out of a
rear carrier. Also studs (which aren't cheap) don't come in the wide
variety of lengths that adapters do, so you could end up having to saw the
tops off your aluminum lug nuts to seat them.

Finally, your wheels will move out into the flares when you lower the car,
so you might want to be a bit conservative with adapter/spacer thickness.
