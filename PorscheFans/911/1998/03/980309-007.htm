Well, I believe the alternator in my 911SC I was asking about previously
is an externally-regulated Marchal, which is why it looks like the
Motorola depicted in the Haynes manual. However, it appears that it has
no set of isolation diodes, which is not uncommon according to the guy
at Astro Auto Electric who tested it.

However, now that I'm putting it back in the car, I have a new problem.
The plastic endcap which covers the connections on the back has two
metal 'vanes' attached to it, to create an air duct, which helps guide
air into the left-hand heating duct. I assumed that these 'vanes' should
bracket the air duct, forming a channel around it. However, when I
attach the plastic end-cap in this manner to the back of the alternator,
it just won't fit back in the housing. I can get it to almost fit if I
turn it a quarter turn and push it in, but when I try to turn it back to
the right so the bolts to attach to the shroud line up, the whole unit
is forced back out. I notice scrapes on the case near where the ground
strap is mounted.

If I put the end-cap on one bolt clockwise of the above configuration,
so that the bottom vane is at the top of the left-hand air channel and
the top vane is almost vertical, the alternator slides right in.

My questions are:
1) Should an externally-regulated Marchal not have isolation diodes?
Could this be why I get the faint glow?
2) How are those $^%* metal vanes supposed to line up? Are they not
really supposed to create a 2" or so wide channel directly into the
left-hand heating duct? Is only the bottom vane supposed to do so, and
the top vane serve some other channeling purpose?

If anybody can answer this, could you please send me a direct reply? I'm
desperate, and have taken the morning off to try and fix this problem.
Yes, it has been several weeks since I last Porsched.
