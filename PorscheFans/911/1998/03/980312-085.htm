This is one of those jobs that is easy to do with the engine out of the car.
With the engine in the car, it helps to have 3 elbows on each arm. At any
rate, you need a deep socket with a slot cut down the side for the temp
sensor's wire. I bought a socket and cut it with a cut off wheel equipped
die grinder. Or you can order the socket from Baum tools. Buy the temp
sensor first and measure across the hex flats to see what size socket you
will need. If I recall, it was 13mm. The original one was smaller, but you
don't need a special socket to remove it: just cut off the wire (no going
back at that point!). The only other tricky part is getting the wire through
the grommet. Cursing helps (or at least it helped me ;-).

Good luck!
