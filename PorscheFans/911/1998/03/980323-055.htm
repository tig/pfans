This is a repost of a message I listed two weeks ago. The airbag warning
light comes on as it should upon starting my 92 C2 coupe, it then goes
off  for a second or two and then re-lights. The light remains on until
the ignition is turned off.  The same routine each time the car is
started.  The dealer
said likely a bad connection with the damp and cool weather we have had
here in Ohio.  He told me to drop off my car and it should not take long
to discover the cause with the tester which they have (and which  I wish
I had).  Easy enough, but for the 2 hour one way drive. Has anyone had a
similar problem. Any usual suspects?  I  generally don't mind a two hour
drive in my Porsche but the drive to the dealer is straight and full of
expansion bumps all the way. I much prefer to use my time and the car's
miles on the winding, hilly  roads of  Southern Ohio and Northern
Kentucky. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
