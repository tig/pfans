Gary:

Only the leading edge needs to be beveled.

When I beveled the leading edges of my Porterfield carbon/kevlar
pads, it seemed to help A LITTLE, but it certainly wasn't a complete
cure for the squealing... And I've never used Pagid Orange pads, so
I don't know whether it helps with them.

However, I DO have this bit of advice to offer:

If you use a grinder to bevel the pads, wear a mask... There's 
nothing in brake-pad dust that will do your lungs any good.

Also...

If you have any electrical equipment near the grinder, move it far
away before beveling the pads... The dust from many types of pads
(especially carbon-based pads) is electrically conductive and will
cause BIG problems if it gets sucked into an electric motor or
whatever.
