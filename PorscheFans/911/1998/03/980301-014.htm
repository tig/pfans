On March 1, Larry Stephens asked about Zims and Vertex for parts:

Vertex is in Miami, FL.  Phone is 305.442.2727.  No web site or catalog
mentioned in ads.  They also add a surcharge of 3% for credit card
orders.

Zims is in Bedford, TX.  Phone 800.356.2964.  No surcharge for credit
card.  No web site or catalog listed; $20 minimum order.

Both advertise regularly in Pano and Excellence.

My $.02 on parts from these suppliers:  Their prices do seem low, but
that to me is not necessarily a positive feature.  Especially for a car
like your '89 Speedster, I would be careful about using heavily
discounted parts.  Your car is a fine piece of automotive machinery as
well as an expensive asset.  Consider the implications for both
performance/reliability and also potential impact on resale along with
the short-term benefit of lower price.  This is especially true for
critical parts that are difficult and/or expensive to install.

Also, with Porsche's PPE program, you may find that the Porsche part at
a dealer is not as outrageous as it once was.  At least give them a try,
and ask about PCA discounts.  You might also want to look at My Porsche
(Seaside, CA; 800.655.3280; www.my-porsche.com), which specifically has
Porsche parts listed in the PPE program.

Good luck,

Robert Herbert
