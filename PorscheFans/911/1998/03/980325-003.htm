Hello,

I just bought a 993 Twin Turbo fiberglass body kit for my '77 911 Carrera
3.0. The car is a street car.

I'm not sure what is the best way to bound the fiberglass quarters to the
metal.   I was hoping that somebody out there could help me out here,
because I've spent a lot of money on this and don't want problems to pop up
1-2 years after installation.

I will have my bodyshop do this, but this kind of work is very uncommon here
in Iceland.  We mostly modify 4x4 vehicles and the fiberglass parts(fender
flares)  are bolted on (like GT-2 body kits)

So, what I am looking for is:  

* Should I glue them to the metal? if so what kind of glue is best    
* Also is it common to rivet or screw the rear quarters to the metal?  if
riveted can I expect some cracking problems later on? 
* Any special treatment of the metal, like bending, making lips or ... ?
* Other things that I forgot to mention ;O)

Any help would be greatly appreciated since I want to do this right.

Best regards
Runar Unnthorsson


PS.  I will probably be documenting the process on www.onno.is/Runi  but as
of now I have only had the time to put one picture up there: the end result ;O)
