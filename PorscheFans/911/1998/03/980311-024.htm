Rene asks why his turn signal indicators on his 911 (I assume) of
unspecified vintage both come on no matter which side he puts the turn
signal lever to.  I think my '77 may do this also (though it isn't something I
notice one way or the other - who really cares as long as it reminds you
that they are still on when they shouldn't be?).  I'll have to check.

But what I do know is that when examining the wiring diagram at length
over many years I could never figure out how the wiring layout could
cause the indicator lights to come on selectively.  There are no integrated
circuits in there, just switches, bulbs, and wires (plus the flasher device,
of course).  I expected to see one wire come from the right side switch
and to to the right indicator, and one to the left.  Not quite that way, as I
recall.
