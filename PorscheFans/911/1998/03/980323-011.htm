Todd,
I would check the two primary ignition cables to see that their insulatio=

has not been chafed by the ground strap which runs along the left hinge o=
f
the engine lid.  Their was a TSB addressing this problem, which can also
cause warning lights--usually the ABS light--to illuminate.  The fix is t=
o
replace both ignition cables and to re-route the grounding strap so it
won't chafe.  The strap doesn't need to be removed, just rotated 180
degrees along the bent portion of the hinge tube.

Hope this is your problem and fix!
