<<<<<<<<I drive my C4 only 4 minutes to work and 4 minutes back during the
week.
 Is synthetic oil still better than mineral oil in this case.

Is there any other consideration I should worry about because of the =
short drive (about 2.5 miles?)>>>>>>>>>>>>

IMHO - use a bicycle for this run and give the old girl a damn good
thrashing at the weekend, that should warm up her oil !!

Slightly more Seriously tho' alot of people have raved about Mobil 1 "as
porsche recommends" but think, why does they recommond it ? - OK, its good
oil, but the fact that Mobil 1 also happens to be a major sponsor might
also be significant;)  !

Had a discussion on this with local, well respected, race/road preparation
specialist (Steve Mchale - Machtech, for those in the UK), his comment was
use mobil 1, it won't do any harm - BUT why push so much oil out of the
exhaust and increase any leaks, under engine. Being so thin, (now 0W40,
this year in the UK) its good for new cars with tight fits but on anything
over 8 years old/60,000 miles use something abit thicker. Thats all there
was available when pre 90's cars were new and there are pleanty 200,000+
miler early 911's.  This echoed Steve Kevlins comments in porsche post
winter '97 - pre 89 models over 75,000miles may be better on Castrol GTX,
Magnatec, Esso superlube X etc.

I'm now trying GTX, instead of Mobil 1 in my '88, but planning to change it
more often - no puffs of smoke at start up anymore, and it looks like
consumption has dropped too.
