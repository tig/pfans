Peter,

Glad to hear you're enjoying your car!  Since you mention exploring the
physics of your car, you may find the series entitled 'The Physics of
Racing' both entertaining and informative.  It lives at the Central
Pennsylvania PCA region  (Home page: http://home.ptd.net/~psprechr/),
but you may find it much faster to go directly to the series itself
(Physics of Racing series, 12-parts,
http://members.home.net/rck/phor/).  I found this series by Brian
Beckman to be reasonably easy to understand, and I find I learn more
from it each time I review it after driving a bit.

Hope this helps, and enjoy!  (Thanks to Walter Fricke for the original
referral to this site)
