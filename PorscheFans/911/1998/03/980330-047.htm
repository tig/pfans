John,

My condolences on reading about the damage to your Targa.  In the words of
our esteemed(?) POTUS, I feel your pain.  Where do you live?  A similar
incident happened to a neighbor of mine in the Fan District of Richmond VA
a few years back.  A vandal chose the passenger side of my neighbor's
pristine turbo-look Carerra as the medium upon which to carve the 'f-word',
from wheel well to wheel well.  Nothing stolen, just an obscenity taken out
on a Porsche.  Luckily (for me), my Targa was parked around the block, and
went untouched.  My luck lasted for two years until I moved to Miami; I
suffered an attempted theft (where the thief leaned that no, a knife will
not easily penetrate a targa top, no matter how much it is carved up; and
yes, shattering the window is an easier way to enter the car) as well as a
direct hit from an egg that cut into the paint rather nicely on the drivers
side door.

Such is the fate we suffer for simply owning these cars that are so coveted
by others!

Rob

80 911SC Targa
