Andrew,

Your switch has almost certainly burnt out. 911s don't have a relay in the
headlight circuit, so all the current goes through the switch. It's a common
failure for people who uprate bulbs. It may be worthwhile checking the
fuses, though, just in case.

Also : my experience with 130/90w is that (a) they tend to burn out pretty
quickly and (b) I got flashed a lot by oncoming cars, even when I was on
dipped beam. I have overcome both of these problems by using 100/80w; even
with these, I did however put 4 relays and 4 additional fuses (one each for
left and right, high and low circuits) 

I don't know anything about 964 prices, but would guess 100 quid or so,
unless you can pick one up secondhand at an autojumble.
