If it turns out to be failed tensioners, don't panic.  I had never been
inside an engine before and it only took me about 4 hours and $20 of
parts from the dealer to rebuild mine.  I was ready to pay a local
wrench $500-$1,000 to have the hydraulic tensioners installed when a
friend talked me into doing it myself.  He was closeby if I needed his
help, but it wasn't necessary. The instructions were pretty clear and
more time was needed to read instructions and remove/reinstall engine
tin/covers than was spent on rebuilding the tensioner.  The only
difficulty I had was getting the rebuilt tensioner back into the engine;
I vaguely recall an inexpensive  tool that compresses the tenionser
(Automotion?) that would make this much easier.

Good luck and I hope its something simple.  But failed tensioners did
not turn out to be that bad on my 911.
