Hey all, 

Okay these are all going to be probably old hashed threads so
PLEASE PLEASE feel free to reply directly to me and not bother the

rest of the list with this old stuff.. Or not :) 

1) 1974 911 Targa, 2.7 motor.. I just jacked it up (where is the
best place for jack stands?) and almost every bolt I touched under
the motor was loose, why? Do these engines vibrate that much or 
was the wrench that worked on it before I got it not so much of a
wrench? 
I was wondering why when I started it I had a small smoke screen
after a while, plenty of oil on the exhaust, both sides. 

2) I need some good factory manuals for this car now so I can get
things torqued right and not mess anything up, etc.etc.. 

3) Are those brass nuts that I see under there? brass??? hmmmm.. 

3) Battery, what is best battery? (optima) Are there other
preferances and any specific size? The one that is in the car is
huge and takes an act of pure adrenaline to get it out and in, not

that it's that heavy but it's surely too big to be in there. Also
I see a stock location where a hold down rod should of been but
this battery is so big there is none. So battery and new hold
down, where and what type? 

5) any other tid bits for a new 911 owner.. 

Like this car, it's going to be so much fun getting this set up
for time trials and stuff.. WHOOOHOOOO.. Sorry that is the country

in me, I guess I could of Yodled (sp?) for the German in me but
how am I gonna do that in Email if I can't even spell it. 

Thanks again and sorry for the moronic questions..
 
Tory
