Bob,

Your Clifford Alarm and the Keypad are (should be) two entirely separate
systems.  The Keypad comes with a code hard burned inside (not
changeable.)  The only way to change the code would be to change the
module that the key pad connects to.  If I remember correctly, the
module is about $30 and it would come, again, with a code burned in (not
changeable) so no, you can't program your ATM code into your Porsche
security system :-)

The Clifford Alarm remote code is changeable. So if you are worried
about someone else having a copy of your remote code, you can have it
changed.  Some Alarm Shops would charge quite a bit of money to do this
but, in any case, cheaper and better work than ar the dealer.

BTW.  In general, and as advise, the P dealers and big stores like Best
Buyers and Sound Advisers, etc. do not do a good job installing after
market alarms.  You can usually get a decent install  at the smaller
shops around town that have been around for a while.

FYI.  I don't have an Alarm Shop. I was an installer at one of those
small shops a few year ago and it was amazing to see the terrible
installs from that came in with problems from the dealers.  I think my
opinion is non bias and I hope I don't offend anyone with this message.

Hope this helps

Luis
