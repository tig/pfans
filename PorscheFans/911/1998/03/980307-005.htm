Yesterday I called PCNA to register my 1987 Targa and to get a list of options
that came with the car. In addition to those that are listed on the sticker on
the underside of the front hood, the PCNA rep listed two more. These are 934
and 291. She said that 934 was "Seat cover-rear" and indeed Charlie Kindel's
website shows this as "Seat cover rear SSK". What is this?
She did not have a description for 291. Since she listed the options in
ascending  order and listed 291 last, I wonder if the 291 could be something
like Z91. Does anyone know what 291 or Z91 could be? Charlie Kindel does not
list either of these numbers. The PO told me that the car had a special
interior upholstery option. The camel (don't know if this is the correct color
descrition) seats have a dark blue piping. Could this be the code for this
option?
Also, the PCNA rep suggested that I get a Certificate of Authenticity. What
additional info would I receive that I don't already have and is it worth $30
?
