Tom:  

Which model 911 do you have?  If it is a 964 (C2 or C4) there is a separate
drain to drain the oil line to the filter, otherwise oil will come out and
make a mess.  I suspect, from your question that you are planning to replace
just your filter without changing oil?  I always change both at the same time
but if that is your intention, try just opening this drain (it is under the
car behind the rear wheel on the passenger side).  If changing both, open all
three drains and let them drain for a while (helps if oil is slightly warm).
Then get a few towels or rags and quickly unscrew and remove the filter.  Some
oil will still spill out.  The next trick is to get more than 5 or 6 quarts of
oil back in as that is about all it will quickly take.  I crank over the
engine without starting it to get the oil to circulate, then add more.  It
will take a few iterations and about 12 quarts of oil.  Don't forget to
replace all 3 drains and the filter first.  Porsche usually will give you new
aluminum drain plug gaskets which, depending on the shape of your old one
(shoud look uncreshed), you may not need.
