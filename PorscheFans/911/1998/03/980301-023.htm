I decided to do some more checks on the Mutant Alternator, using the
tests in the Motorola alternator section of the Haynes 911 Owners
Workshop Manual (only because that was the closest visual match I could
find to my alternator - anybody know where I could find some Marchal
info, or are the two brands related?) When I got to section 9.18
(Alternator-dismantling, testing, servicing and reassembly/Motorola
alternator/Isolation diode test), I noticed that when I connected my
ohmmeter between 'D+/61' and 'B+', I got near-infinite resistance in
both directions.

My questions:
1) What do the isolation diodes do?
2) Could they be related to my dimly glowing dash idiot light?
3) I also, when testing the positive and negative rectifier diodes, was
uncertain which were the positive and the negative. So I tested the 'D-'
post against all of them, and the 'D+/61' against all of them as well.
While I got infinite resistance in one direction and less in the other,
I got the same measurements in all cases, i.e. I know sometimes I was
testing the 'D-' post against positive diodes and vice versa. Would this
have any relationship to the above-mentioned 'isolation' diodes, or am I
practicing voodoo? (Not that there's anything wrong with that)
4) How can I differentiate between negative and positive rectifier
diodes?
5) Any idea what I should expect the average alternator shop to charge
for replacing all the diodes?

Thanks, and again (hazy) pictures reside at
