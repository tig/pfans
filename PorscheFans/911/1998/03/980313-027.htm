Morning PFans,

I recently was visited by a friend from switzerland who also happens to
own an 85 carrera (as opposed to my SC). After comparing notes (they got
more HP over there, the cars are surprisingly cheaper, but he gets
hammered with insurance and gas price), he mentioned that he was a
member of the Swiss equivalent of PCA. And there, one of his friends who
passes as an expert told him the following : " Due to the particular
design of our cars, they are not well lubricated at startup and it is
better to let them idle something like 5 minutes before leaving your
garage" !  

That puzzles me, because I thought that bad lubrication was true of all
cars when cold, that 13 quarts should do a better job than the 3 qts on
my ghia, and because I had read many times and thought that it's better
to get on your merry way immediately (both for emissions and
lubrication) but not to push the car until it's warm, and it warms up
faster that way anyway.... 

May I have a (local) expert's opinion either way please ?  ;-) 

Greg.

PS: What pleased me is that he reported the same tranny noise in his 85,
I'm glad I did not try to "fix" those after all !
