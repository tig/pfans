OK.  Ordinarily I just read and don't yak, but since you asked...

The drivers ed issue is something all insurance carriers will likely run
scared from.  The simple fact is we lose our shirts on this sort of risk.

Our program is endorsed by PCA and was designed around the results of a Club
member survey.  When asked to pick from a list on what was important in an
insurance policy, only a few cited DE-type coverage.  As such, we didn't
place a high priority on it when building our program.

We insure literally thousands of Porsche owners who are almost exclusively
weekend enthusiasts.  If we're not the biggest insurer of enthusiast Porsche
owners in the U.S., we've got to be near the top.  If anyone is going to get
hammered by customer demand for track/drivers ed coverage, its us.  It
hasn't happened.  While a few are turned off by our no-DE exclusions, the
vast majority literally don't care... and even more importantly would take a
dim view of our need to raise insurance rates to cover the DE losses we'd
suffer.

John Heckman of Chase & Heckman is a good guy, and a long-time Porsche
enthusiast.  He was formerly one of our program's exclusive agents, so we
know him and wish him well.  I can recall conversations with him where he
wanted us to add DE coverage to our program.  He later decided to compete
with us and offer DE coverage himself.  He appears to have learned a lesson
the hard way:  you have to sell a *lot* of $300-500 (annual) insurance
policies to be able to pay off $10,000+ losses and break even, let alone
make a profit.

I'm sorry, but he was the only one we knew of who offered DE coverage.  I
can't give you any good news, but I hope I've at least explained the
situation from our perspective.  If you can find the coverage you're looking
for, we'd appreciate knowing of it so we can recommend it to those who have
the need.

Finally, I note you mentioned C&H was deleting OTC (Other Than Collision)
coverage due to losses.  If thats the case, then a Collision loss is still
covered.  However, I can't see why they'd delete OTC at all.  Its Collision
thats the killer here, and where you *need* the protection.  If only OTC is
deleted, you're still OK if you kiss a wall, go sight-seeing off the track
etc.  Check back with them.

Questions?  Comments?  Ask away.
