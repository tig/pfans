    Andrew:

    Oil temperature should be 180 degrees F, oil pressure should read
    10-15 psi per 1000 RPM.

    I'm not sure what you mean by "the gauge in the clock", but I
    suspect that you're talking about the oil-level gauge.  If it's
    ever accurate, it'll be when the oil is warm and the car's
    idling, parked on a level surface.

    Yes.  911s use a dry-sump oil system, so dipstick measurements
    are only accurate when the engine is running.  Make sure that
    the oil is warm and the car is parked on a level surface, too.
