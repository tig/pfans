I would like to comment on a couple of things.

OEM steel lug nuts have a tapered seat.  This is for tightening up against
a tapered seat on the OEM steel wheel.

OEM alloy lug nuts have a radiused seat.  This is for tightening up
against the radiused seats found on OEM alloy wheels.

If the wheel studs you are using are too long and you wish to use OEM 
alloy wheels you can cut the tops off the alloy nuts or cut the studs.
Yes, they can be cut by several things.  If you need assistance your local
machine shop will be able to help you.

Piano wire substitute for heater control wire. My local "ACE" hardware
store has "Piano" wire in several diameters.  The heater control wire is a
continueous loop that runs from one heater flap valve to the other.  The
wire continues through the heater control handle in the middle of its
length.  The stock wire on the '74 I am currently working on is coated
with a plastic covering.  This may be the difference in the prices you are
seeing for replacement wires.  The "piano" wire ACE has, is coated with
black paint.
