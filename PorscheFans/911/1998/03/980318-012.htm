Hi,

Dunno how close the manual really is on this, but what tire sizes are you
using? That will of course impact speed/revs.

Not 100% positive for an '87, but the 'stock' rear tire size (for the
optional 16 inch wheels) is probably 225/50.

Also, have you checked your speedo against a measured mile? It's unlikely
to be reading high (unless your tires are non-standard), but you never
know...

Cheers,

Ross
