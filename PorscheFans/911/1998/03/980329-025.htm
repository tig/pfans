I may be in trouble with my 91 C2.  I am asking for your help.

I recently took the car in for the 30K tune up.  The car was running fine, 
just normal maintenance was required.  After the work was completed the car 
now has a problem that the mechanic cannot solve.

In all but one instance the car idles and runs fine.  The problem comes 
when the car is stopped after coming up to a stop light or at the sign at 
the end of an exit ramp.  The car stops, the idle drops to 1000 rpm, all is 
fine for a moment, the idle drops to 200, stays for a moment, climbs to 
800-900 and then continues to idle fine.  When the car is driven away from 
the stop all is fine until the next stop and the problem repeats itself.

My mechanic thought this would be a small problem to sort out but it hasn't 
been.  Now I'm worried.  Could any of you suggest solutions or perhaps ask 
your mechanics?

The valves were adjusted, new plugs and filters installed, all the checks 
were made.  The OZ sensor was not changed because it was not required by 
the manual and it checked out OK according to the mechanic.  The fluid in 
the tiptronic transmission was changed.  The mechanic, who is working hard 
on the problem, is stumped and that makes me nervous.

Could the computer be messed up? Could changing the oil in the transmission 
do this? Is the OZ sensor bad?

Thank you for any suggestions.
