Have to post this, my P-enthusiasm grows every time I drive the car and
I want the world to know.

I am slowly approaching the danger zone now, exploring the physics of
Porsche handling. It is just amazing how good the car feels once at the
right speed, with the right amount of throttle and steering input. Once
it has settled into a corner, you can really feel the potential of
steering the car with the rear end. Walter Rorhl was right, cars are fun
when they have 200 HP+. 

Of course, I'm talking "potential" here. I'm not there yet and have a
long way to go before I master the specifics of this car, but I am
surely on my way to automotive heaven, driving a very well balanced
piece of German car engineering. And I am already anticipating the first
track time I have planned early April. 

With two feet back on solid ground, I have some sound questions (well
actually, questions regarding sound).

My 88 Carrera has the standard speakers and an in-dash radio CD unit the
previous owner graciously left me. Currently, all I want to do is listen
to the car, so the radio is the least used accessory in the car. Still,
I have some nice HiFi stuff I want to replace this lot with : a radio
and separate CD Changer (Pioneer, 6 CD) and Boston Acoustics Pro 6.2
speakers and the accompanying hardware (crossovers and the amplifier). 

My question : where do I put all this stuff in a 911 ?

1. What about the speakers. The Pro 6.2 set has a 6.2 inch (logical,
isn't it) mid/bass driver and a 1 inch tweeter. To get the sound these
speakers produce (they are GOOD !), the mid/bass driver is rather deep
and heavy. Can I replace the standard speakers in the front doors with
these ? How do I get to them ? What do I need to look out for ?

2. I need to hide away the crossovers. Where to I put them (under the
dash ?).

3. And the amplifier ? I was thinking about the passenger footwell (can
I put anything behind the foot rest ?). Any considerations regarding
possible interference (I is only a 2x70W amp).

4. Any ideas on the CD Changer. I saw one in the boot, standing up,
close to passenger side wheel. All suggestions on placement and mounting
tips are very welcome.

Thanks for all the response I got on my previous post and happy
Porsche-ing to you all,
