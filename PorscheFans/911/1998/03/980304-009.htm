The Porsche engine was the PFM -Porsche Fleugzeug Motor-,
or -Porsche Aircraft Engine- (Duh..) and it was used in
the Mooney PFM. Cessna also advertised a C-172 model with
it, but they never entered production as the C-172 production
ended. This was one of the first attempts at a new generation
of aircraft engine, and was one of (if not the) first application
of integrated engine management systems into a light aircraft
engine. There was a hard merket at the time of introduction, and
the engine was viewed with suspicious eyes by the very conservative
aeronautical buying market. Hard to get it worked on at your local
airport, it would seem. The engine was quietly withdrawn.

Technical differences between boxer aircraft engines and boxer
auto engines are mainly that aircraft engines need to produce 
power at low RPM's (usually 2200-2400) for long periods of time at 
near-constant power settings, while the RPM ranges and changing power
settings of an auto engine are obvious. Thus the cam profiles, etc.,
all all entirely different. Igniition systems are duplicated as well,
typically with two magneto driven spark systems, each independant of
the other. The PFM, of course, was a twin plug engine. 

The PFM engine was not Porsche's first attempt at producing an aircraft
engine. My trusty "Aircraft Engines of the World, 1961/62" lists two
Porsche engines for aircraft, both seemingly derived from the 356 engine.
Each is a 1.6 liter opposed 4 cylinder, twin plug design using Scintilla
Vertex magnetos. The Porsche 678/3 produced 52 HP at takeoff (3200 RPM)
and the 678/4 produced 75 HP at takeoff (4600 RPM) by using a gearbox to
reduce propeller RPM. The ungeared engine used a pair of Bing carbs, the
geared engine a pair of Zeniths. I wonder what one of these engines would 
be worth now? Bet the twin plug 356 heads would be a prize..... 

As for other crossover applications, the VW boxer engine has been used
for years in homebuilt aircraft, either in full (4 cyl) configuration
or half (2 cyl) configurations. There have been factory aircraft engine
designs using a full of half VW case manufactured and sold. Less numerous
are BMW boxer twin motorcycle engines converted to aircraft use. In Russia
the BMW clone "Ural" engines have been used as well, taking the occasional
Russian aviation enthusiast across the former Iron Curtain to freedom.


Steve at Rennsport wrote me to tell me that he has been using aircraft
type engine trend instrumentation for years on his engines. Just when I
thought I had something up on him! Oh well..........  ;-)

of Russian Ural sidecar motorcycles (no excuse for my taste in bikes...)
