Hi Garland,
I am the guy who posted the message on synthetic oil change last week.
I have a 1985 911 w/90,000 + miles on the car. I too had concerns about
oil leaks, and etc, etc, etc... 
After some feed back from several people on the PF list I decided to try
the change.  What have you got to loose was my conclusion and if I don't
get the performance that I want from the oil I will just drain it and
put back the old stuff. 
So my recommendation is to try it and see if it makes a noticable
difference in your car, if not change it back to conventional oil.
I personally noticed that the engine runs cooler than before and I could
swear that it runs a tadd quieter. It has been about 2 weeks since the
change and no oil leaks yet!
Good Luck!
Don
