RE: Brake Bleeding Scenarios

Seems like a lot of car owners have excess cash to spend on expensive pressure
brake bleeders and torque wrenches. For the frequency I'll be bleeding my
brakes (oh, maybe once a year or two), I'll opt for a low cost, yet effective
way to accomplish the same. This method is not going to beat flat rate time,
but hey, watch your laundry tumble in the dryer or polish your your car during
this process. Here's a brake bleeding method I passed along to the forum
awhile back:

I have found the method described by Alan Caldwell in a past Pano article
inexpensive and very effective for 1-person bleeding. Get some lengths of
plastic tubing (about 2.5' long) from the hardware store. Its I.D. should fit
snugly over the O.D. of the bleeder screw. Place the tubing on the bleeder
screw and suspend it vertically somehow, you want the open end up. Now open
the bleeder screw and let gravity allow the brake fluid from the master
cylinder to enter and exit the caliper taking whatever air bubbles there are
with it. The fluid level in the tube will rise only to the height of the fluid
level in the master cylinder. This part is very visual as you can see the
bubbles rise to the top of the fluid in the tube. Tap the caliper with a metal
object to loosen any bubbles that may cling inside. Using this method you can
even work the brake pedal to speed up the process. Want to replace the fluid?
Curve the end of the tubing over into a can and let it drip out while keeping
an eye on the master cylinder. With the fluid almost gone, add new fluid ....
or start with a turkey baster and save a few minutes watching the fluid go
down. When you see fresh fluid exiting the caliper, close the screw. You can
do all 4 wheels simultaneously or just 1 at a time.

PS. 
-For you racer types:  Alternate between ATE Super Blue and Gold fluids to see
what's new and old fluid. Actually, racer types already knew that.
-Use a beam-type torque wrench for long-term accuracy or else calibrate your
click types periodically.
