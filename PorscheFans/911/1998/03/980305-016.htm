....I have found that owning a 911 is like owning your first good camera.
If you're not careful you tend to become a gadget collector. 
You have to stop and ask yourself, "do I want these gadgets, or 
do I want to take pictures?" 
If you are a mechanic who does lots of brake jobs or someone who wants
to impress your friends with all the great equipment you have the
pressure bleeder is for you. You don't need the hokey "speedbleeders",
either.
These goodies are God's way of telling you that you have too much money.
If you work on your own car why waste the time and money? 
In the time it took to discuss the bleeder(s) today 
I could've bled my 911's brakes "the old fashioned way" 
and put in all new fluid. 
More attention should be paid to ensuring that you always use the
correct grade of brake fluid. 
Having a friend help you by depressing the brake pedal make it something
of a social event. 
It's as simple as this: 
Get a length of clear hose that will fit snugly over the bleeder screw.
Make it long enough to reach the floor when attached to the bleeder
screw (cost about 50 cents and infinitely reusable). 
Have the proper size wrench available, preferably a box-end. 
(Remember to put the box end over the screw before pushing the hose over
the bleeder screw nipple). 
Push one end over the bleeder screw nipple and put the other end of the
hose into a coke bottle with a little brake fluid in it. Start with the
wheel furthest away from the master cylinder (passenger rear). 
Take the cap off your master cylinder and suck out most of the old fluid
in the reservoir with a turkey baster. Fill with new fluid. 
If it's been a long time since this has been done, 
put a few drops of penetrating fluid on the threads of the bleeder - 
this saves a lot of broken off bleeder screws. Be careful - this isn't a
huge grade ten bolt, you know!
Have your friend press down on the brake pedal, then open the bleeder...
just a little. You will see bubbles and dirty fluid moving through the
hose. The brake pedal will slowly sink to the floor (don't worry, the
brake master cylinder is made for this much travel). Your friend should
hold the pedal on the floor until you close the bleeder screw. 
The pedal is then allowed to rise slowly up and the cycle repeats. 
This all very simple and you soon get into a routine, saying
"down....up" to the person working the pedal. 
("Down"..open.....close.."Up". "Down"..open.....close.."Up" - etc.)
My daughter became quite adept at this when she was 9 years old. 
When the hose is showing clear, clean fluid with no bubbles, close it
and move to the next-furthest wheel. Repeat the process. 
When you get up to move to another wheel, check the master cylinder
fluid level and keep it full. 
In under 10 minutes you are done. 
No worry about pressure, or ruined seals (which can happen with pressure
bleeders) or air being sucked into the system (as with vacuum bleeders).
Simple. No fuss, no muss. 
Don't get it on anything that is painted as brake fluid is a great paint
remover. 
Buy small sealed bottles of fluid and open them only as you use them. 
Throw away opened bottles. 
Brake fluid (except Silicone based types) is hygroscopic - it absorbs
moisture. 
You bleed brakes because; 
1. air has invaded the system, making the pedal spongy, or 
2. the fluid is old, and contaminated with moisture, leading to rust of
internal parts. 
Silicone works great and doesn't absord moisture but it is not always
compatible with the materials used in seals, and tends to be a little
spongy in race cars: ie, cars that use brakes hard and get them hot. 
To use it you must be very careful to remove as much of the old,
glycol-based fluid as possible. 
Glycol and silicone fluids don't cause any great problems together...
they don't mix, but the more of the old type fluid you have left in the
lines the greater the old problem of moisture is. 
Why go to all the expense for Silicone and then do only half a job? 
Silicone (DOT-5) fluid is a good idea for a collector car that sees very
little use. Go to silicone when you renew the cylinders and lines. 
This really isn't necessary if you bleed/purge your brakes once a year.
Be careful not to overdo it with your pressure washer especially around
rubber seals. Water can enter the system by being forced under pressure
past seals.
Dispose of the old fluid properly. It is toxic, especially to pets.
**
I have used K&N air filters in every vehicle I've owned for the past 25
years or so. That includes fast Motorcycles to V12 Jag's and some
big-block cars that needed a lot of air. I have always found them to
work "as advertised" and I like the reusable feature. Engine wear has
never been a problem at all. It will take a lot more than a report about
earth mover problems to make me switch. I have tried many other filters,
like oiled foam and always found them inferior to the K&N. Paper
elements are okay at best and tend to choke the engine as they get dirty
or worse yet, wet. If you want to spend $30 to 50 dollars each to
replace an inferior filter on a regular basis, go ahead, but I'll stick
with the best - K&N.
