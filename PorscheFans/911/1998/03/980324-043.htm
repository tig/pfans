Had this question in a slightly different combination, but the content
should also apply, so I resend my reply to GABRIEL PENNELLA who wrote:

100mm CV joint used the later transmissions, or you replace the drive
flanges on the transmission with ones which fit your existing axle. I
had
difficulty finding any transmission drive flanges for the 108 mm
(earlier)
CV's as the spline in the differential is also different (fine spline
for
late transmissions, coarse spline for early transmissions). In any
event, all 3 components must match.....transaxle flange, axle and stub
axle.

Personally I would replace the wheel side axle stub (which is what I
did).
These are a bit of a pain to take off as you need to loosen the
castellated
nut which
secures them (it is visible when you take the wheel off) and it is
torqued
to about 220 ft lb. Need to somehow block the axle from turning and then

use a BF bar/rachet to get it to turn. Once it is off (the nut that is)
the
stub should slide out as it is splined to the flange to which the wheel
studs are attached and then you
slide in the new one, tighten the nut and all is well.....except you
need
to replace your axles with the ones with the 100mm cv's.

Hope this helps
