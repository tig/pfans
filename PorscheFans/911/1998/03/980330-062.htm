Hello, folks, an insurance question for you:

Well ... this 88 Carrera I just bought with 23,000 miles is maybe a little
TOO nice to become the daily driver (I put 66,314 miles on my 95 BMW 325i
Cabriolet in just three calendar years), so I'm considering having
Leland-West (sp?) insure it as a "pleasure vehicle" - the deal is, put
5,000 miles a year on it, and they'll insure it for an agreed value. I
figure it's worth $27,500 as it is pristine, never hit, never painted, zero
wrong mechanically (except for this little reluctant starter problem and
this squeaking bedspring deal .. but that's another post).

Anyway, Leland West will insure it for about $525 a year.

After learning that State Farm would try to "replace" the car should, God
forbid, it be stolen or totaled, or otherwise "settle up" with me -
probably for $16k or so, and that they want $1100 a year to insure it (and
that's the "pleasure" rate with them; a whole $150 a year less than the
daily driver rate), it sounds like Leland-West is a good deal. I shudder to
think what kind of car State Farm would come up with as a replacement ...

Anyone use Leland-West for their garage queen, and has anyone settled a
claim and been happy? Is this the same firm endorsed by PCA?

Vic
