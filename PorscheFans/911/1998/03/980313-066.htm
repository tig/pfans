I have been reading some letters concerning engine oil and would like a little
help on the subject myself.
I recently bought my first Porsche  ( 1973 911T Targa ) and will have to have
the oil changed in the Spring.  I live in Rochester,NY and the car is being
stored now.  A couple of import repair shops suggested using Castrol GTX 20 -
50 as the car is on-road from May - November.  My friend who has a '69 912 and
2 earlier 356's said he puts in Mobil 1 synthetic oil.  He also has a '89 Audi
5000 in which he puts in a 1/2 synthetic oil mixture (Pep Boys generic type
$1.50 +/- per quart).  What would be best for my car ( it has 92,500 miles on
it )?  Has anyone tried those "bonding synthetic oils" ( I think you put in
only one quart or so ) that are so heavily advertised on the television such
as Prolong?  Is this good for older Porsche engines?  You know the
advertisements are quite convincing as they drain all the oil from the enigine
and it still runs for 24 hours or so because their product has formed a "bond"
with the moving parts,etc. !!!!!!!!

A repair shop cautioned me about trying to change the oil myself.  They said
that it was more complicated then changing the oil in most other cars because
of the 11 or so quarts of oil.  The guy told me that they pull the plug, drain
the oil, remove the old filter, install the new filter, replace the plug ( and
strainer? ), put in 7-8 quarts of new oil, drive the car for 2 miles, put in
remaining 3-4 quarts of oil.  First of all, is this the method ?  Second, what
is so hard about that?

I would also like to change the fuel filter ( the car has mechanical fuel
injection ) and was wondering if there are any special tricks for that
process.  I did notice that there are 4 hoses ( lines ) connected to the
filter ( my other cars all have 2 ) and I am wondering if there is any special
order to their removal and/or reconnection.

Is there a favorite spark plug to use?  Bosch Super W5D, Bosch WR Platinum
WR5DP, NGK BP7ES, Beru or ?  How would I find out the gap for the chosen plug?
Would the seller give me the CORRECT information?

I think I can handle the air filter installation myself !

Thanks for the help,
