Sorry for the long question here, but this is not the usual "clean the
contacts and replace" problem I used to have on my 914. I would like to
know, a) if there is a special procedure to bleed the '93 C2 ABS circuit
independent of the brakes, and b) can I test the sensors and control box
with a multimeter? The relay and fuses check OK (my wrench says).

Contrary to what I think I read in the factory manual, my mechanic says
the ABS shares the same hydraulic circuit and does not need to be bled
with the Bosch tool. Is this right? (One caliper was disconnected.)

My ABS has been funny ever since my off-track excursion last year. On
subsequent track days a rear tire could be heard locking up on heavy
braking and no ABS pulses felt. BUT, in the snow, I did get ABS pulses,
but they felt different somehow, than I remembered before (rougher?). Is
there a g sensor on the C2 cars that might have been damaged in the
front-end wall kiss (no airbag deployment, no frame damage)?
