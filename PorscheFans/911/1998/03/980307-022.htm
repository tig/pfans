Bob,

  I have the same problem with my 80 911SC.  Recently I took it into  
Porsche to have it checked out.  They diagnosed it as the WUR and  
replaced it to the tune of $750.  Unfortunately for me, that was not  
the case of the problem, although the surging seems less severe now.   
I posted this problem in several places on the net and got answers  
pointing to just about every component in the K-Jetronic system.     
This surging problem seems to be indemic to the SC's and may not be  
any one component but the result of wear on several components  
working in conjunction.

Here is one of the responses I received:

Almost all 911SCs do this, especially in the winter, and especially at
high altitudes.  You can limit this behaviour by adjusting the idle
speed to about 1200 instead of 850, but this won't eliminate it
comletely.  Also, if you give it a little gas while it's warming up
it'll be stable.  I just give it enough to stablise at ~1500 RPM until
it's warm, then it runs fine.  I usually only have to do this when it's
sat for 8+ hours under cold conditions.  Many less experienced mechanics
will claim it's the cold start valve, or the warm-up regulator, or leaks
in the main injection boot or whatever.  After hearing many stories like
yours, and talking to many PCA affiliated mechanics, the consensus most
honest people I've dealt with have reached is that it's normal.  It
probably has something to do with the age of the FI system.  The
K-Jetronic is a fairly simple setup, and something changes as it ages,
causing it to oscillate under cold conditions.  I think you could
probably systematically replace every FI component and get it to go
away, about $3000 later.  I'd just leave well enough alone, and if it
really bugs you, ride the throttle while it's warming up to eliminate
the surging.  I look it as a reminder to let my car warm up properly.  

Hans is an old German mechanic with decades of Porsche experience, he
cut his teeth on 356s.  When I asked him about fixing the cold surge on
my car he grimaced, threw up his hands, and said something to the effect
of "Bah, hrrrmmph, hah, they all do that, you can't fix it easy, I'll
take your money if you want me to try but probably in the morning you
will still have it."  He continued his tirade for several minutes.  This
was said while shaking his head, pacing in a circle, and waving his arms
around.  I got the impression that he's tried to fix this many times
before and has always been frustrated.  It clearly pissed him off to
even bring up the subject.  He's like that.  A good Porsche mechanic
likes to have everything perfect, and when he finds something that
refuses to cooperate it gives him fits.

The real truth on 911SC cold surge is probably that it can be caused by
any of a number of components being a little worn.  This means that it
can be fixed, but you might replace 2-3 FI components before you hit the
right one.  Some mechanics may beleve it's the warm up regulator,
because that worked for them once, others may have had luck replacing
the cold start valve.  I think I'll just live with it, rather than drive
myself nuts trying to find the source.  I thinks it's kind of
distinctive.

Good Luck,
Pass a fix on if you find one!!
