I don't understand why people use the digest mode of this listserver. All
modern email programs have the ability to filter mail into specific folders
using rules. With digest mode, you only get one message containing all the
others, so there is (theoretically) less traffic between the mail client and
the server, but it cannot be *that* significant.

With non-digest mode you can sort and organize to your heart's content. For
example I use Outlook's "Group By" feature to group messages by subject,
this allows me to see all the messages in a thread. Other mailers have
similar features.

*However* the fact that so many people use digest mode, and thus have to
type new subject lines for replies causes this "group by" to not work very
well on this list. It makes following threads difficult.

*My* guess is that people read the text on
http://www.porschefans.com/Subscribe.html that says "Daily Digest -
Recommended subscription mode. You'll get a daily collection of messages
sent to the list." and just go with it. Couple that with the fact that the
web based subscription page doesn't give you an option of non-digest and it
might explain why so many people get the digest. Can we get the text on that
page changed (BTW, the main page is hopelessly out of date. I'll happily
volunteer to update it).

I would like to make a few suggestions for this list:

#1 Don't use the Web interface to subscribe. Use the instructions for
sending change email described in the FAQ
(http://www.porschefans.com/PorscheFansFAQ.txt):

	Send mail to subscribe@porschefans.com in the form of:

	JOIN <list-name> [<email-address>]
	    Join or subscribe to the list. A copy of each message sent to
the list
	    will be forwarded to the email address given.
	DIGEST <list-name> [<email-address>]
	    Join or subscribe to the list. A single message will be sent
each day
	    containing an indexed summary of all the messages that have been
sent to
	    the list in the previous 24 hours.
	LEAVE <list-name> [<email-address>]
	    Leave or unsubscribe from the list. If your address has changed
since
	    you joined the list, append your original email address to
cancel the
	    subscription to that account.
	HELP [<list-name>]
	    Provide help about the list server or about the specified list.

#2 Don't use DIGEST mode. If you do, when you reply to a message make sure
that the subject line on the reply is of the form "Re: <original subject>"
where "<original subject>" should be replaced with the EXACT text of the
original subject line.

#3 Don't use "aliases" or "address book entries" for 911@porschefans.com.
Doing so makes it very difficult for automatic rules to filter on incomming
messages. For example, some messages come into my inbox addressed to
"Porschefans" or "Porshefans-911" (Gary Cuozzo and Giles Mike respectively).
I have updated my automatic inbox rules to look for these as well, but I
keep finding new ones. It's not hard to remember "911@porchefans.com". 

It would be nice if these suggestions could make it into the subscription
page and the FAQ...

This is an amazing list. I love being on it. Hopefully my suggestions will
be taken in a positive way.
