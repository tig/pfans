<<I faced the the same problem on a European

Carrera 3.0 too. I found out that this had been

caused by the vacuum-valve-switch of the CIS

(In germany CIS is called Bosch K-Jetronic).

On European cars it is located on the left

side of the engine right below the heater

blower. It is a tiny black and white shaped

plastic cylinder of a diameter of approx.

4-5cm (A little bit less than 2 inches).

Thickness is about 2cm (less than one inch).

There are two rubber vacuum lines connected to

it, one in the middle and one noncentric. An

electrical plug which has 2 wires is the last

thing mounted to it. 



On cold start this valve is opened and will

influence the warm-up regulator (mounted be-

tween intake lines of cylinder 1 and 2) to

provide more fuel (change the air/fuel mixture

to more fuel) for running the engine at

a higher idle speed.



After a few seconds this valve will close.

Now the warm-up regulator is not been influenced

by additional vacuum anymore. Idle speed should lower

a little bit. On my car from ~1600Upm to ~1100Upm.

After the warm-up regulator has warmed up idle

will fall down to ~800..900Upm.



Please check if the electrical plug is connected

to the tiny vacuum-valve-switch. Otherwise the

bimetal inside vacuum-valve-switch will not warmed

by the electrical heat inside and valve will never

close. Engine remains on high idle.



Please check if one of the two rubber vacuum lines

is brocken or not mounted. If one is left open the

engine runs on high idle even if it is warmed up.>>
------------------------
Juergen did a good job explaining the vacuum switch, except that the valve is
closed initially at startup and *opens* 25-30 seconds after startup.  

The purpose of the vacuum line to the control pressure (warmup) regulator
through the vacuum switch is to richen the mixture during normal engine
operation when the throttle is opened, then the resulting reduced vacuum in
the intake manifold richens the fuel mixture via the control pressure
regulator.  The puposevacuum switch holds off vacuum during the first few
seconds of warmup, thereby richening the mixture.  So in warmed up operation,
an open (disconnected) vacuum line would prevent the vacuum from the manifold
from reaching the control pressure regulator, and richens the mixture,
increasing the RPMs.

I believe only the early SCs had this valve,  maybe the '78 and '79.
