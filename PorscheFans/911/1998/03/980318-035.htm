Here is a list of the parts that I need for my 79 930:

1. the passenger side 1/2 of the wind deflector that pops up when the
sunroof is open.  If need be I will buy the entire piece, but really
don't need it.  I'll probably need the screws with it as well.

2. the decorative plastic temp sensor cover (and screws) that is located
on the headliner of the car in between the two sun visors.

3. 930S or RUF front spoiler w/ or w/o oil cooler.

4. do you know if it is possible to replace the large headlight washer
"squirters" that are currently on my car to the flush mounted of later
years?  I don't care of they function better ot worse, I just like the
flush look better.  If anyone has those I am interested in them as well.
