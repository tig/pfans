My personal So Fla experiences (not all on Porsche paint):

Zymol - easy to apply,  looks good,  smells great,  but does not last long 
(in SoFla).   

Mequiers #23 - hard to apply (to get off more precisely),  looks good (but 
not as "liquid), lasts fairly long based on beading.   Must have clean paint 
prior to application.

Speaking of clean paint forget the paint cleaning clay.   Big disappointment 
for me at least.   Back to Griot's garage.

Mothers Gold Paste Wax with cleaner.  Great for areas around the wheel 
wells,  door bottoms,  etc.   Lasts pretty well.

Malms -  Surprising hard to get off,   looks good,   lasts slightly longer 
than Zymol.

Blitz - Tried this yesterday.   Easy to remove if you let it dry but you 
must apply in thin layers using a foam applicator if possible.   Looks 
pretty good and has good reflectivity but does not have that liquid quality. 
  Remains to be seen how well it hold up.  Again must have clean paint.

Nu Finish:  Not on my Porsche.

Something that works real well without any long term effects has been Honda 
spray cleaner for motorcycles.   I have used this to clean off bugs and for 
quick touch ups.  Works better than Griot's Fast Shine or McQuire Final 
Inspection equivalents since both of those seem to be too watery and they 
slide off immediately.

I would not use Armor All.   I use the Vinyl and Rubber treatment from 
Griot's and have been reasonably happy with it.   I have used Black Again 
and short term was happy but not long term.  

The best thing you can do in So Fla is to keep the car in a garage or under 
a cover.

Good luck.
