Hello,

Just got back from having my car teched for the season and discussed the
wheel-vaseline subject with my mechanic.  I had done the wheels about a
month ago and was pleased with the result.  After an autox last Sat still
had a nice sheen and little brake dust adhering to the wheels.  My
mechanic suggested WD-40 works just as well and throws off dust even more
readily.  This is on the Fuchs alloys that came as options on 87 911's.
Same technique as with the Vaseline, wipe on and rub off well.  Makes the
black portion on the wheel look very good.

Another tip he gave me concerned crud build up at the rear of the front
wheel wells.  When he took the wheels off I was amazed at how much junk
had collected back there.  I guess turning the wheels away from the car
and spraying with a good strong hose will get most of the stuff out but we
used a screwdriver the build-up was so bad.  He's seen cars where the
build-up behind the left wheel had bent the oil return tubes.

Final thought - He suggested removing the right fog light for track
events.  The housing is held on with one bolt right behind the light.  I
guess the oil cooler is right behind this opening and with the light
removed the oil can cool more efficiently.  

Happy trails,
