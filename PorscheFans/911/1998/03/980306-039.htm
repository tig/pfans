Here is the rest of the story:

Fox SportsNet has acquired the rights to televise 1998 Formula One races in
the United States. The Australian GP is now slated to be televised, on a
delayed basis, on Sunday at 10:00 AM in all time zones. Apparently Speedvision
will still be able to televise the first few races of the season on a live
basis.

The catch is that I do not believe that this is the regular Fox Network
stations but the Fox Network Sports stations which are, in most areas, only
available on satelite.  Kind of sucks for all of you that just got ESPN2 so
they could watch F1.  Some of you may remember that, when ESPN first started,
it ran lots of motorsports but then they faded away.  Samething is apparently
happening with ESPN2.  I guess they just didn't bid enough.  Wonder where
Bernie Eclestone's head is.  They do/do not want F1 is the US so what do they
do?  Let some obscure station carry the races ON A DELAYED BASIS!
