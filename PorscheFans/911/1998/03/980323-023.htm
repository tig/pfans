Jay,

>my problem is that I don't own an air

>Can this job be done w/ a foot pedal air pump or my
>space- saver air pump?

Try them.  If they work, then it can be done. Sometimes
you need more pressure than others.

>What kind of fitting do you need? Can I use one

>of those soft rubber tipped air nozzles or do I need a
threaded fitting to screw into the caliper?

A threaded fitting would be better, but I've blown
dozens of pistons out with just a plain vanilla air
nozzle held tight against the fitting.  You can get
a better seal with a piece of paper towel of something
wrapped around the nozzle.  This isn't rocket
science.

>Are there any other good ways to get the pistons out?

A grease gun works great, but it's messy, and you need
the right fitting.  The old standby when all
else fails is to just put them back on the car and
use the brake pedal to do it.

>4. When is it necessary to split the caliper in half?

I've never found it neceesary.   My guess would be only if
you saw leaks along the seam.  Beware, if you split the
caliper you'll have a heck of a time finding the sealing o-ring.

>If the pistons look correded once they are out can you replace
>the pistons only or do you need to scrap the caliper?

You can buy replacement pistons.  I don't know what you mean
by 'scrape the caliper', but the bottom line is the pistons
don't touch the caliper.  They ride on the seal.  So the
caliper need not be perfectly corrosion free.
