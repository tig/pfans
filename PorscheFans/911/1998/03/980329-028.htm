After procrastinating the better part of forever, I finally got after the
valve adjustment today.  Since my car is on a lift with the rear end
nearly up against the wall, I have taken a somewhat different approach -
namely, I emptied the oil and adjusted only the exhaust valves today (the
stuff that's done from underneath the car).  Once I get everything
buttoned back up on the bottom side, I'll lower the car, move it forward,
and do the top-side stuff.  Before you ask, I "jogged" the motor around
to get each of the tappets freed up - checked each one twice to make sure
I wasn't climbing a lobe.

Anyway, here's my questions (valves are adjusted, covers not yet
re-installed)...
1) Five of the 22 nuts came off with the studs still attached - Is this
typical?  What's the best way to get the nuts off the studs?  What's the
best way to re-install the studs - double-nut and use red loctite? 
2) Underneath two of the dry head nuts there was some black/rusty dry,
gritty powder - any ideas what this is?  (It was on the cat' side only).
3) Anti-seize paste on all studs before securing the nuts I presume, yes?
 
4) Since I might not get to the intakes right away, I may go ahead and
re-fill the oil and drive the car  - I'm thinking I won't have a problem
with the oil level being pooled up and spilling out when I take the
intake covers off, correct? 
5) Is that a Maserati logo I see on the inside of the valve covers!?

For those of you interested, here's what I found...
1) All but one of the valves were tight - not by much at all - the most I
had to unscrew was a quarter of a turn.  I'm inclined to think the
previous owner's mechanic may have just set them that way.
2) All the exhaust studs are fine (big sigh of relief) - I just put a
wrench on each one and applied maybe ten pounds of pressure - no movement
on any.
3) All valve guides would seem to be okay - I couldn't get any movement
of the valve stem when applying force via a screwdriver.

All comments or questions are welcomed.

Thanks,
