My Solo 5 has the battery cover problem, but I just use a piece of
reinforced tape holding it down and it works fine. Someone else I know
did a plastic weld of the case, which also holds it together (the screw
is too small). The new Solo appears to be free of this problem. Your old
Escort works better on standard X and K bands (as the Car & Driver tests
show), but does not get the newer Ka band and wideband Ka that are in
much more use today, nor the laser band, which is less prevalent. I sold
my old Passport (which I had after the Escort) when the locals got
Stalker guns about 4 years ago. I've since had a 4600 and now the Solo 5
and get as many Ka alerts as I do K band.
