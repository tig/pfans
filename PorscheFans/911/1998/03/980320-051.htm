    Lisa:

    Who's Curtis Pyatt and where did he get the information that
    synthetic oil is a poorer heat-transfer medium than organic oil?

    Correct... But do you know why?

    The main reason is that high heat temporarily lowers the
    viscosity of multi-grade oils, which leads to thinner oil films
    and, therefore, increased friction.

    The other reason is that most oils -- all organic oils and most
    synthetics, but not Redline -- decompose at the temperatures
    (400-600 degrees F) seen in turbocharger bearings and upper
    rings.  As they boil away, those oils leave behind hard deposits.

    Those hard deposits coat metal surfaces, reducing heat-transfer
    ability, and may even build up in the ring area and cause ring
    sticking.

    Finally, high temperatures can lead to oil oxidation, which
    permanently thickens the oil.  In typical oxidation tests,
    organic oils generally thicken by 150% or so, while synthetics
    thicken by as little as 20%.

    Note that none of the above effects have anything to do with the
    temperature of the METAL in the engine; they're all caused by
    the temperature of the OIL.

    Therefore... Even if Mr. Pyatt were correct about the
    heat-transfer properties of synthetics vs. organics, his
    information would SUPPORT the claim that synthetics are superior
    in oil-cooled engines.
