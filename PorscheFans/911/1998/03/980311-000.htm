I have an 83 SC with 98000 miles on the original engin.

I just bought the car at 95000 miles and it has the carerra 
tensioners.  The motor has been quiet all along (for a 911), 
but this afternoon when I started it, there was a LOUD 
metallic noise coming from the rear of the engine.  (right 
side I think)  The car has never made this noise before.  It 
is apparently RPM dependent, because it gets faster as I rev 
the engine.  I shut it down and tried again later... same 
story.  My only thought is that one side of the chain failed, 
and is resting on the plastic guides.  That would explain the 
noise, because the slack is riding on the cam housing, and 
rubbing, causing the noise.  I have to go to work in the 
morning, but I cannot go if my car is screwed up... Please 
advise on any fixes, causes!!  Thank You

Chris Jares
