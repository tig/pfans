It is widely known that the stock 911 C4 has understeer. Actually, all
late-model Porsche 911's (964's and 993's) in stock form intentionally
understeer by design, because of the complaints and law suits from
accidents that resulted in the earlier cars oversteering. However, the
C4 understeers worse than the C2. This problem is especially present in
the 1st generation C4 (1989-94  964). However, there are some
straightforward modifications that can be applied to produce a very
stable-handling automobile. Unfortunately this later fact is not widely
known or understood.

Why does this problem exist in the first place? First of all, the
factory cars were shipped with 205-series front tires, which is way too
narrow to support the extra grip needed due to the additional weight and
drive power at the front wheels under hard cornering. The C4 AWD system
adds about 230 lbs additional weight, mostly to the front end, to the
964-model cars. The weight penalty is about half that amount with the
993-model AWD system. In addition, the front ride height is way too high
on the US cars, in order to conform to the Federal requirements for
bumper heights. In addition, the factory cars are softly sprung with
progressive springs. The high center of gravity and soft factory springs
cause the car to roll too much, which is going to exaggerate the lack of
bite on the front end.

With lots of modifications, the understeer problem has been solved on my
own C4 car (1990). The car handles very neutrally now, even under
aggressive track conditions (Phoenix: PIR and Firebird). A couple of
experienced Porsche drivers have driven my car and really like its
handling characteristics. My colleagues with rear-wheel C2's (even 993
C2's) with similar suspension modifications and tires have trouble
maintaining the same kind of stability on the track while 'following'
me.

Here is a list of what I have done to my own C4, which will look pretty
radical to the street car owner. If you want something less aggressive
for street use, there are some inexpensive ways to change tires, sway
bars, springs, and shocks to make your C4 do just about anything you
want. So here is my list:

   * Lower the car and use much wider rubber on the front; if you have a
     standard narrow-body car, you can run 245's on the front on 8.5in
     rims, and 275's in the rear on 10.5in rims; this barely fits under
     the fenders, and you need to run aggressive negative camber to
     clear; if you have a wide body C4 (1994), or if you have an
     after-market turbo body on your earlier C4, then you can run 275's
     up front and 315's in the rear.
   * How much negative camber? Run about 3 degrees front and 2 degrees
     rear; this much negative front camber will cause the front end to
     bite hard and stick well; for street use, this is too much camber;
     something like 2 degrees front and 1 degree rear will work;
   * In order to lower the car properly, you need to use the GT2 EVO
     front wheel hub carriers and tie rods, which can be purchased
     through Porsche Motorsport; this enables the geometry and bump
     steer to remain linear with aggressive lowering;
   * For track use, the ride heights can be set at the 993 RSR
     recommended specs, which are 95 mm front and 208 mm rear at the
     specified measurement points; this is too low for every day street
     use, however;
   * Now to lower the car this much, you also need to use a racing
     coil-over setup with stiffer springs; you can purchase a RSR-type
     or Cup Car-type shock/spring/perch setup from Porsche Motorsport,
     or you can buy an after-market package; in either case the shocks
     have to be about 2 inches shorter than stock to compensate for
     lowering the car so much for track use; for street use, this is not
     as much a concern;
   * Adjustable sway bars; you can get after-market copies of the Cup or
     RSR bars from AJUSA if you wish; that's what I am using; set the
     rears in the mid-point position and the fronts in the
     second-softest position; remember, the sway bar should not be doing
     the majority of the work, but the springs should; if you set the
     front sway bar to firm, the understeer will get worse;
   * Add a front air spoiler; you can get one for $250 from AIR; this
     will put more down force on the front end; get an RSR-type
     adjustable rear spoiler (AIR or M.A. Shaw) to balance out the down
     force front and rear;
   * Learn how to drive the car differently than you would a C2 and take
     advantage of its characteristics, making it work for you; try to
     get faster cornering by attaining greater exit speed, rather than
     pushing too much with excess corner entry speed;


Measured differences in track performance: with the suspension in stock
form with R-compound tires, the best my car could do at PIR was 1:17.
After these modifications, the times dropped to 1:11. I have a friend
with a 1996 twin turbo putting out 435 hp at the rear wheels, with an
aggressive Cup-type suspension setup similar to mine. The best time he
could turn on the same day was 1:09, which makes my 1:11 look
respectable, especially given an essentially stock engine (mass flow +
headers, putting out about 260 hp at the rear wheels).

Bottom line is that the 964-C4 has never lived up to its original
expectations in handling, giving the car a bad reputation. At this
moment, the reputation of the Porsche C4, both old and new variety,
remains one that is 'good for rain and snow, but not for the track.'
This reputation is unfortunate and totally unnecessary. The blame goes
to Porsche. They could have easily solved the problem with a modest
amount of additional engineering development. Why they did not do so on
the 964 remains unclear, especially since they spent so much research
and development on the 959 in the mid-1980's. They did make improvements
in the 993-model AWD system, but still not enough to excite the
performance-minded enthusiast wanting better dry track handling. But the
good news is that you can keep your C4 and create a really wonderful
automobile that does what you want it to do.
