Tom,

Check out the Niagara Region PCA website at
www.wzrd.com/home/niagarapca and go to their
Tech Tips section.
www.wzrd.com/home/niagarapca/TechTips.html

This has an entry entitled:
'911 Windshield Replacement by mti@ccnet.com'

Although this concerns a dash replacement, since windshield
removal is required, that process is described.

As I am currently involved in doing this for dash installation
and headliner renewal, I can offer a few other notes:

1) be prepared to touch up paint and deal with possible
small rust spots (likely on a '75 from the pre-zinc
coating days)
2) buy a new Porsche seal (too late? yes it's expensive, but not as
expensive as doing it twice; mine was about $55 from a
Porsche dealer, with a 10% PCA discount)
3) 3M recommends using a black acrylic sealant if needed,
especially around corners of new seal.  While some have
suggested the use of silicone sealants, they are much
harder to clean up if they should get on paint
4) make sure to remove all old sealant from mounting
lip.  3M makes a Tar, Grease and Adhesive removal
liquid, about $5 a can.

BTW, another, more detailed, description of this process can
be found in Lindsay Porter and Peter Morgan's 'Porsche 911
Purchase and Restoration Guide'.  I got this from Automotion
for about $35.

Hope this helps.  Remember, its not just a car, its an
adventure in creative problem solving!

Good Luck,
