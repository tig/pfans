Mr Ken Ross was asking for info on buying a Jaguar XJS.

Well,only one option:don't
Before I started driving Porsches I was totally mad about Jaguars
since my dad had a 61 e-type convertible.
When I was 23 I bought my so-called dream-car,an 83 XJS HE.
(HE has to do with the compression,fireball technique I was told,
compression in europe is high,12.5:1,for good MPG or something).

After 3 months the dream was over.I will explain why.
The look of the car is excellent,however I don't know what kind of
steel they used,but you can hear it rusting when you listen really carefu=
lly.
The electronics in the car is also something else.When I needed the
lights while driving at night,they started to go on and off,and then stay=
ed off.
Same for the wipers.After repairing all those things,I really wanted to =
drive
the car ,without all those little problems,but the faith in the car was =

totally gone when one dutch Jaguar -club member told me that you have to =
buy
2 Jaguars for daily transportation.One to drive while the other is gettin=
g fixed in
the shop...I sold the car after that and bought my first Porsche,a '79 =
928.
What a difference.Still have the car,together with an '82 911sc.
I think my best move in life was to cancel my Jaguar-member subscription
bought the 928 and 911 and started enjoying owning two of the best sportc=
ars
in the world .
