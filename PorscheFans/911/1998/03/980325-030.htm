Hi folks, 

Yesterday, I got back into my 83SC whic has been nicely rained on,
turned the key in the ignition, and could hear the starter turning but
the engine wouldn't start.... @#$%

You know, when you turn the key, all the electric stuff comes alive and
there is an electric "power-on" kind of noise. Well, the electric stuff
did come on but that familiar noise was gone.... 

So I push started it and it ran fine, got home, parked it on the ramps
ready to whack a solenoid or two and check the wires under there (last
time a wire from the starter relay was loose but then there was no
starter period), but just before going whacking, for fun I tried to turn
the ignition off and start it again !  It caught the first time. And
this morning too !!!  (but I parked on a slope this time).... 

So what is going wrong here ? if the starter turns but nothing happens
is it the solenoid ? A fluke ? Expensive ?   ;-)  

Thanks !   Greg.
