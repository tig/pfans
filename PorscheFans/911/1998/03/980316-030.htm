Regarding types of polishes and waxes...

This seems to be a notoriously difficult topic to get clear direction on.  I
think it must be that everyone has their favorites that work, and once you find
the ones that work for you, you don't go out of your way to compare against all
the others around.  (I still keep trying though.)

Here are a couple bits of info that I can provide, given the above caveats.

At a recent PCA Concours Tech Session here in San Jose CA (note: I am not into
Concours but figured I'd get some good pointers about general care and
products), the people with quite a bit of experience in preping their cars all
agreed that Meguiar's makes the most consistently excellent products at
anything resembling a reasonable price.  They use Meguiar's.  They also said
not to bother with the ultra-expensive brands -- no clear benefit.  A body shop
I had to visit last year (:-() which specializes in Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi
also recommends the Meguiar's line.

My own data point -- I've settled on products from Griot's Garage (mail order)
which have been outstandingly good.  (Really do try their paint cleaning
clay!!)  I am sure these are virtually all repackaged and marked-up products
available elsewhere at a lower price, but every Griot's product I have tried
has performed beyond my expectations, and that relieves me of the trial and
error I would otherwise end up doing.  I had actually used Meguiar's before
Griot's on other cars (before I ended up as a Pcar owner) and was happy, but
felt I needed "better" for the Pcar.  This was before I found the strong
testimonials above for Meguiar's.

I've also gotten generally very high recommendations for the Mother's and Wax
Shop lines but haven't tried any of them.

Absolutely stay away from any product with silicone -- Armorall and many other
ultra-convenient products.  While I personally have not seen any specific
studies and results, among all serious car care people it is entirely unanimous
that silicone causes long term problems for materials with oils that need
preservation (like, everything inside and outside your car).
