Ken,

A while ago, I had to make the same decision as to which to buy.  The 3.2
is generally cheaper than the 3.6(964), but slower.  The cars really have
very little in common.  I believe Porsche claimed the 964 model was 80%
new.  The best answer to your question is drive both.  They are very
different.  The 964's are smoother, quieter and faster, the 3.2 has more
character and requires more from the driver.

Most 964's will give you airbags, ABS, an understandable heater, decent
A/C, the neat little moving spoiler (sounds dumb, but for some reason I
love this stupid gimmic), etc.

The typical areas to look for on the 964 are:

1 engine oil leaks, early models especially- they had no mail seal and it
is very expensive to fix the annoying little drips (dont ask how I know
this one)

2 distributor vents- the dual distributors need to have a vent hose added,
most caring owners will have already done this

3 clutch - the dual mass fly wheels tend to fail, but most cars will have
had this fixed by now, or it won't be a problem on that particular car

4 on C4's, the front differential - most don't leak, but it is expensive to
fix if it is leaking.

I of course chose the C4 and love the car.  It is the best Porsche I have
ever owned.  For me and even more for my wife, after driving both, the 964
model was the car that fit our needs and wants much better.

Good luck, and I don't think you can go wrong with any 911.

Hope this helped.

Jad
