100mm CV joint used the later transmissions, or you replace the drive
flanges on the transmission with ones which fit your existing axle. I had
difficulty findingany transmission drive flanges for the 108 mm (earlier)
CV's as the spline in the differential is also different (fine spline for
late transmissions, coarse spline for
early transmissions).

Personally I would replace the wheel side axle stub (which is what I did).
These are a bit of a pain to take off as you need to loosen the castellat=
ed
nut which
secures them (it is visible when you take the wheel off) and it is torque=
d
to about 220 ft lb. Need to somehow block the axle from turning and then
use a BF bar/rachet to get it to turn. Once it is off (the nut that is) t=
he
stub should slide out as it is splined to the flange to which the wheel
studs are attached and then you
slide in the new one, tighten the nut and all is well.....except you need
to replace your axles with the ones with the 100mm cv's.

Hope this helps
