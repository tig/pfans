Yes, 225/50 ft and 245/50 rear.

They will work fine but rare and VERY expensive.
Also not legal for stock class.

>  b. Will the 8x15's work in the front or is the offset no good (like 911
>  Turbo 8x16's)?

They will definately rub unless your car is not lowered and has
very stiff torsion bars.

Yes, that is what I found, the car was significantly faster on the 245s.  
This was on a stock 3.2 Carrera in SCCA A-Stock. Handling is much more
important than acceleration.
