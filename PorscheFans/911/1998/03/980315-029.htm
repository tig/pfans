Dear P fans:

I need some help. I live in S. Florida, the sun bakes the heck out of paint
and summer's coming. I've been told by someone to use Zymol polish on
Porsches. There is so much out there: Mother's, Blitz, Zymol, McQuires, 3M,
..... on and on. Is there a preferred polish or wax for Porsche paint? Also, I
read in consumer reports that Nu-finish was the best polish out there but
someone else told me that over time it is harmful to the paint. He said
something about it drying the oils in the paint. Sounded murky to me. I'm not
into detailing my car into showroom condition every week but I would like a
polish that will protect the paint from fading especially in Florida and with
my silver(the worst for fading) paint. 
Also, any suggestions on interior and exterior rubber protection? I've seen
some postings that suggested not using armor all. Has anyone out there used
Black Again? Is it good stuff and how much?
thanks, Ernie
.
