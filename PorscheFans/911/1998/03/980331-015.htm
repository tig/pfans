 Hi all,

 My rear window exploded the other day, and after some discussion with
local P-car folks and the dealer there was two lines of thought. It
has been more common with the widebody cars. (from the dealer.)

 One was it was due to body flex putting strain on the window, thus
giving away, giving a cracking noise first then shattering.

The other was the 3-rd brake light shorts to the rear defroster wires
and kaboom, when you hit the brakes.. 

 I had used the defroster while the car was warming up and turned 
it off. About 3 miles down the road (after may stops) I was slowing 
for a construction area, the thing went off. First glance back and
a softball hole in the window missing, then the Damn thing crumbles
into a million pieces and falls into the back.... 

  Has anyone figured out this problem? Does Porsche have a service
bulletin? I have to wait 2 months for new rear interior and would
like this to be the last time it happens!!!
