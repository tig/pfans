I can't help on the 964 vs 993 questions.  I am relatively new to
Porsches, having had an '88 911 Carrera for about one and a half year
that I have been using as a daily driver.  Until then I have had much
newer cars, and was really skeptical about driving a 10 year old car
daily.

I have had no serious problems with the car.  I have had a loose
fan-belt, and my speedomoter sensor died (a pretty common thing, I
gather).  I changed a real light assembly that was corroded.  Recently
my window shield washers won't work intermittentant, apparently some
contrats that corrodoes and needs to be cleaned, i.e. pretty minior. 
All in all I may have spend $600 on various maintenance (I haven't
done any maintenance myself)

I have added about 15k miles - it is now close to 50k -   and I have
even driven it in the white stuff, which happens when you live in
Green Bay, and now Chicago (though I have tried to avoid it).  It
actually handled better than my old Corrodo!

Considering I can easily sell the car for what I paid for it (a first
for me!), the car will be my cheapest car by far even with the high
insurance rates.  But more importantly - the fun factor beats
everything!

Anyway - I think a lot of people use Porsches a lot older than the 964
for daily drivers.  I don't know how much more you pay for the 993,
but the interest onf the money you save will probably pay for your 964
maintenance.  (Not that I am not a 993 owner wanna-be!)
