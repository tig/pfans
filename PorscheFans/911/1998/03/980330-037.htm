Greg,

I had a starter go bad on my 74, and after seeing what it was going to 
take to just remove and reinstall it, I decided to replace it with a 
rebuilt one. Lots less hassle, and you get a guarantee. If you do decide 
to go that route, make sure you can get the parts for it before you 
disassemble it(may not be able to turn it in as a core afterward).
Anyway, good luck to you.
