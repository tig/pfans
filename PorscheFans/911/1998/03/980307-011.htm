The "rule of thumb" in the automobile business is that grey-market cars should
be priced about 30 percent below US specification vehicles.  Many dealers
won't touch them with a ten foot pole.  However, this does not mean that you
could not find a good car at a very reasonable price that would satisfy your
needs (after all...this is an 18 year old vehicle).  As described, the price
would be about right (retail) for a US spec car...for grey-market
equivalent...$10-11K tops with a wholesale value of about $8500 max.  As
always, have a knowledgable techician check it out if you think you can
negotiate the price down to a more reasonable level.  None of these cars (thru
the 89 911) had power steering and the lack of AC is a "plus" in a car that
old (IMO of course).  The third "Z" in the serial number means it is a "Rest
of World" (non-USA/Canada) vehicle.

 I looked at an 81 SC today and have a bunch of questions that I think could
 be best answered by someone on the list.
 
 1.  The dealer claims that the car was imported "a european model" what are
 the pros/cons of the euro model.  The car doesn't have any AC or power
 steering which helps to keep in light and simple i guess.  Is engine size
 and power the same on the euro model.  How can I tell for certain that it
 is a euro model.  VIN# WP0ZZZ91ZBS103057
 
 2.  The car has 138,000 miles on it, how long can these engine/trans go
 before major overhaul, and how much will it cost for a rebuild.  
 
 3.  Is this a good year to start working with, are there any major reasons
 not to purchase an '81 euro sc.  Other than an old engine/trans the car is
 perfect, and looks better that several I've seen that were much newer.
 
 4.  The car didn't seem that fast, could the low octane "regular" fuel that
 was put in the car make a big difference in performance.  
 
 5.  Is $14,000 a fair price, given high miles but great condition.
 
 PLEASE cc:stewartm@cyberis.net
 
 Any response would be greatly appreciated..
