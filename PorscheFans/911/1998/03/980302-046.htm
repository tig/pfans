Eric,

The going price for an 89 Carrera is pretty close to that for a 90 C2. The
newest 964 type C2/C4s of course are more expensive, but that is just
because they are newer cars. I really doubt you will see these cars fall
below the price of the earlier Carreras. Who knows? Since there were many,
many fewer 964 series cars built and sold for each model year than 3.2
Carerras, the 964 may eventually have more 'collector' value. It may take 30
years.........

The 964 is more sophisticated than a 3.2 Carrera and is a bit more
comfortable car for daily use (especially in hot climes). OTOH, the 3.2
Carerra has more of the spartan German sports car feel that many prefer.
