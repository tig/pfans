FWIW #1, to add to Ed Yourkovich's explanation of oil breakdown, the
reudction in blowby of synthetics is the result of the more uniform
molecular structure of the synthetic base stock.  Fossil oil molecular
structure varies in size, the smallest of which are referred to as light
ends.  It if these light ends that are more easily blown by and are also
burned off because of their higher volatility.  GF3, the new standard
for motor oils which will become effective early in the 21stC and which
is undergoing standard negotiation now, will have a significantly higher
volatility threshhold than current GF2 oils.  This bodes both good and
bad for the consumer.  The good is the reliance on synthetics or partial
synthetics to meet the standards; the bad is the higher cost.

FWIW #2, In a past issue of the BMWCCA magazine, I believe it's titled
Rondelle, or somesuch, there was a very good article about an experiment
BMW ran a couple years ago.  They ran a 3-series car for 1,000,000 miles
using only 10W-30 Mobil 1 oil.  It took a couple years to get the
mileage on the vehicle and there were some non lubrication related parts
failures but none related to lubrication.  When the million miles were
up, the engine was torn completely down and all parts were measured for
deviation from original spec.  Only two parts were worn beyond original
spec (don't remember which) and neither was worn to the point of
requiring replacement.  The engine was reassembled using only new
gaskets and the car was put on a promo tour of Europe.  Pocs of the
engine internals were impressive.  Based on my experience in the auto
service industry, I doube that a fossil oil could go that didtance
without at least some gumming and sludging the internals that the Mobil
engine did not experience.  I have no financial connection to Mobil.
