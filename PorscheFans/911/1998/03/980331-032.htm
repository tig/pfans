Hello all,
I am going to put an aftermarket front spoiler on my 930 and had a
question for you all (I posted this to the 928 list also b/c everyone
there is sooooo smart and I know at least someone will write me
back!).                       =)

The RUF front spoiler I am looking at is made from molded polyurethane,
but also costs $1,490 without an oil cooler, driving lights,
installation, paint, etc.  When asked about this the gentleman at RUF
told me that fiberglass front bumpers do not hold paint well and tend to
crack easily and that the PU will "last longer than he or I will."  I
don't want to repaint my front bumper every year but $1,500 seems
steep.  Esp. since fiberglass versions are $250.  Is PU really better or
is RUF just trying to make money (which I'm not against - as long as
it's fair - they quoted $1,000 for a suede steering wheel).  Please help
as I am going to do something soon and am lost!
Best,

Brian Buxton
