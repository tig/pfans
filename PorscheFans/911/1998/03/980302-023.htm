I have performed this conversion several times, most recently this past weekend on my 
wife's 78 SC.

In my experience, it is very difficult to remove the threaded eye-bolts from the 
steering rack without removing the rack from the car.  This last time, I had to use a 
24" breaker bar with the rack clamped in a bench vise.  Not sure whether the factory 
uses a threadlocker compound on manufacture, but it would sure seem so.  The difficuty 
on the car is getting enough leverage and/or the proper approach angle.  Maybe there's a 
special tool or technique to make it possible...

I have used the provided spacer washers in all my installations.  What this means on a 
911 is that at the tie-rod end, the threads will be driven more deeply into the tie-rod 
(yesterday, had about .375 showing outside the lock nut, when I was done and the toe 
was set).  I consider this to be a good thing.  It may be that the spacers are intended 
for 914s and not for 911s (think the 914 has a wider front track; if not, I'm sure 
someone will write a prompt correction!)

The big threaded rod on the end of the tie-rod goes into the end facing of the rack.  I 
have always used blue Loctite and torqued to 80 ftlbs. or so.  You definitely don't want 
that connection coming apart!

The Uniball joint at the inboard end of the TTRod is the feature which differentiates it 
from a normal tie-rod; and yes, this should be tight on new ones.  However, once you get 
it mounted you must be able to move it in order to intall the tie-rods on the struts, 
and also to adjust toe.  I use axle grease liberally around the uniball before putting 
on the dust boots.  You may also want to smear some grease on the rack while you've got 
it apart.

If your car is lowered, you will want to install rack spacers when you mount up the rack 
on reassembly.  I've used chrome spacers available at good hardware stores; 3/4" height 
x 3/8" ID.
