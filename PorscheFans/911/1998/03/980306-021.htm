Hi,

Time for tires, and I *think* I'll be upgrading to 17" wheels at the same
time (might as well do it when I need tires anyway!). I'm looking at
Dunlop SP8000s right now.

The rims I'm considering are the 993 Cup rims, in 7.5" front and 9" rear.

A couple of questions...

- How sensitive is the ABS in a C2 ('90) to differences in tire circumference?
  (I don't think this is an issue in the sizes I'm considering - the
  circumference is less than 1/2 percent different front to rear)

- Recommended sizes? I'm considering fronts of either 215/45 or 225/40, and
  rears of either 245/40 or 255/40. I don't know what will fit, or if these
  sizes are inappropriate for some reason. To keep circumferences very close,
  the 215 front and 245 rear go together well, and the 225 front and 255 rear
  also go together well.

I've already ordered a set of H&R springs for the car, so it'll be somewhere
around an inch or an inch and a half lower. Hopefully the springs will help
take away some of the initial understeer that the car exhibits (they're
proportionally stiffer in the rear compared to the stock springs)... this is
ALSO my reason for looking at slightly bigger front tires than stock.

So... Are the sizes I've suggested wise choices? Overkill on the front?
Will they fit on the car (with the new springs!)? Will they fit on the rims?

I'd love to hear what others use and their comments...

Thanks!

Ross
