Folks:

I need a fast opinion on a 1986 Carrera coupe. The car has 58,000 miles,
it's white with tobacco leather. It has always been serviced at the dealer
in Naples, FL, where the service manager and former chief wrench (Porsche
Master Tech too)  is a buddy of mine. Called the previous owner (a
72-year-old guy who "just wanted something newer" and he sez the car had
zero problems when he traded it in late last week). I got lucky on a phone
call to the wholesaler as he was driving the car back to Tampa Bay, where I
live. The car was hit in the rear 2 years ago, and suffered minor damage
($4000 - hell, that could be just a bumper :-), no mechanical damage, just
cosmetics. My friend informs me that the car had its oil changed every 2000
miles, and no expense was spared - anything it needed, it got.

The deal is, $19,000 tomorrow afternoon, or he gives it to a dealer who
wants the car too (I called first). The paint has been wet-sanded and
buffed, the interior is very clean, new Pirellis, oil change 200 miles ago
at my friend's dealership.

So, having owned an 83 SC and an 80 SC, a 95 BMW convertible for the last 3
years, I have the 911 bug again. This sounds like an ideal car to me at a
reasonable price; particulary attractive to me is the known service
history. It's been well cared for.

I know the 87-89 has the G-50 transmission; what other benefits would I get
by waiting for an 87 and are they worth the tradeoff of knowing who worked
on the car and that it was well maintained? Seen a couple 87s with spotty
histories for more cash.

Anything to have my local mechanic look for tomorrow? Would you jump on
this car?

Thanks, all!

Vic
