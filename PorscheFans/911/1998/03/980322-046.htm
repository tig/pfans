Scott this is a good time to make sure your car has the updated scissor
arm window mechanism. If not get it!. If it does, you can purchase the
guide and rubber sleeve that the window is "pinched" in. Mostlikely the
rubber seal has worn out. I don't think there is any adhesive to be used
but merely friction between the new tight seal and the glass. make sure
you get it in the same location on the glass that the old one was. That
would seem obvious but if you get that new bracket on the wrong place you
won't be able to get it back off easily.

Good luck, Chris
