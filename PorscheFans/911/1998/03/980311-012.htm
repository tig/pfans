<< I noticed a small (1/4") tear in my top that was caused by someone throwing
a
 cigarette on the roof while driving.  The small burn caused this tear.  It it
 straight not jagged.  I brought it to a local top shop and they told me there
 is no way to fix it without putting on a new top.  They want $1900.  This is
a
 very minor tear.  Has anyone used any type of glue or product that will seal
 it up.  I am concerned about water leaks or it growing when I put the top up
 or down.  Also has anyone found a dye that might match (blue top).  The
entire
 effected area is just slightly over 1/4" and I really don't want to pay
$1900.
 The top guy said to try Crazy Glue, but my experience is that it drys white
 which would be a lot worse then the tear. >>

Brian,  I made a similar repair a few years ago by finding a matching thread
at a sewing store. Then made very small / neat stitch to repair the rip.  Then
took very small amount of clear silicone flexible sealant to the underside
of the ripped area.  Yes it was still visible if you looked right at it. but
it did
not cost $1900.00 either.  Overall it was a good durable repair.
