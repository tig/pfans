I saw it as well. I agree that no data should be dismissed. On the 
other hand I believe that Andy is correct when he asks if the test is 
relevant to the average Porsche driver.

As far as I'm concerned that test in Consumer's Report proves that 
the additional expense of synthetic oil is not warranted for the taxi 
fleet they tested. 

What a lot of people don't know is that motor vehicles which are in 
continuous service require less engine maintenance (on a per mile 
basis) than cars which are used intermittently (like ours). 

More harm is done to mechanical parts in the first few seconds after 
start up than in hours of continuous running. The next few minutes 
when the various lubricants are cold is the next worst. Once the 
engine and lubricants are at operating temperature wear is very 
slight. At that point the advantages of synth lubes are not as 
significant.

Stop and go driving is worse than highway cruising, on the brakes and 
transmission, neither of which were part of the CU test.

Every analysis of synth oils (including the ones I used in my 
airplane ten years ago) make it clear that it lubricates a lot better 
than petroleum based oils at engine start up and in the period before 
the lubricants were at operating temperature.

The test I'd like to see would involve a few hundred 'burb housewives 
doing car pools in their mini vans. Short trips with the engine and 
lube never reaching the proper operating temperature. That would be a 
darn site closer to "average" use of a passenger car than a taxi 
fleet.  As far as I'm concerned the most dangerous form of "stop and 
go" driving is the kind composed of 10 or so 5-10 minute trips per 
day with a  hour or more between trips. As in kids to school. To 
mall. Back from mall. To exercise class. back from there, pick up 
kids etc. That is where synthetics really shine.
