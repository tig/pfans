I guess I was one of the ones indicating a problem with the standard 
pedal-push method.  I DID go through 2 master cylinders in about 3
years on my old '76 911 bleeding brakes this way, and I should note this
was a car that saw a lot of race track driver's education events and 
autocrosses, so brakes were probably bled 5- 15 tiimes per year.  When 
I switched to the pressure-bleed method on on that car (prob. about 40,000
miles on last MC when I sold car), used it on my '84 
Carrera (driven for 125,000 miles and 5-10 track events/year), and now
my 993 (with 27,000 miles and approx. 12 track events since Feb. '96
purchase), have not had a problem with a master cylinder wearing out.
I personally believe that over time they build up a wear ridge, and when 
you bleed them by pressing the pedal you push the seals past this ridge
 and wear them out prematurely.  Personal experience here, I am no
expert, so do what you want to.

This is the way brakes have been bled forever.  Millions,
maybe billions of cars have had their brakes bled this way.
It won't hurt the master cylinder.

I don't see how you'll get every last drop of fluid
out oif the m/c if you don't finally 'push' it out
with the brake pedal.
