Hi Pfans,

I sent this earlier but it doesn't look like it nade it through the 
server problems.......


Hi PFans,

Can anybody tell me if there are any difficult bits in replacing the
oil thermostat. You know, the thermostat that's supposed to open at
90C and send the oil to the oil cooler at the front of the car.

It looks pretty straight forward.

Mine is not working so I need to replace it. How can I tell, you ask?
I drove the car home from work and temperature was up at the second
white line (I'm guessing that's 120-140C). Touched the oil lines on
the cooler side and they were cool, touched the oil line on the engine
side and it's almost too hot to touch.

Is there anyway of phyically opening the thermostat until 
i can replace it? Weather is quite hot here at the moment so i don't
want the engine getting too warm.

thanks

terry
