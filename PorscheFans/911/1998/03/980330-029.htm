Hi,

Apparently you have ruined bearings in the alternator.  I remember
reading on this list, perhaps a year ago, about a similar problem.  The
fix is replacing the alternator, or I guess you could rebuild it if you
could get the parts, but I am not sure that is possible.

Easy way to remove the fan:

Tap two of the holes in the center with a size close to the original
hole size.  Use two holes that are 180 deg. apart.  Then you can insert
two screws and jack the fan off by alternately turning each screw 1/2-1
turn.

I have not done any of the above, but have read it from this list.  But
I will soon as my fan key was eaten by a bad pulley.

Good luck and tell me how it works out!

-Michael
