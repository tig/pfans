I talked to mechanic about this idea this morning, and he 
said it was a good idea, but even better would be to 
pressurize a "tank" of brake fluid and have this push the old 
fluid out of the system.  I like this idea, but haven't a clue what I 
could use for the tank to connect to the reservoir.  Also how would you 
construct a fitting to get it into the reservoir?  I assume you could 
use a "dummy" filler cap and somehow attach a tube through a hole, but 
how do you keep it leak-free under pressure?  Any other tips/tricks on 
blleding brakes?  I've never done it before.....
