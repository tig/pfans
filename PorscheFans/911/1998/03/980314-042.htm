I've seen several comments questioning whether Euro 993s were, in fact,
lower than U.S. bound bodies and also the last observation as to 'bumper
height' being the mandated reason.
What I've understood for many yrs, (and I'm sure I'll be corrected if
I'm wrong) is that it has nothing to do w/bumper height (shoot the only
thing the bumper height on that   ## SUV that followed me home was lined
up with was my head). Excuse my SUV attitude.
It's all about Fed regs on head lamp elevation (you know, the same
peaple that brought us the exploding pillows, Bruce's term). Lower the
car (to where it looks & drives a little better) and the the down-ward
angle of the head lamp, relative to the road) has to be reduced or your
beam is at an unexceptable(unsafe) elevation for uncoming eyes - or so
the regs would say. (ie.Euro ride height + Euro head light beam
elevation is elegal in U.S.)
Some one tell me if I'm wrong on this.
Personally I've had  2 of my cars lowered. How you go about it deserves
appropriate attention, as the archieves of this list can attest.
