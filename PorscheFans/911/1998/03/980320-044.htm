Bob,

Wear is not so slight at full power near the engine red line, even when at
normal temperature. Street cars of course spend very little time (on a
percentage basis) in this zone, so it is not usually a source of major
engine wear. Racers and some Porsche drivers spend significantly more time
in this zone, and it is a greater factor. Here a synthetic is probably a
good idea too. Also, if your car has heat problems, as many Porsches do in
warmer climes, a synthetic will probably prolong engine life and
reliability. Synthetics are supposed to have better heat transfer
characteristics, but I have never seen numbers for this. They will hold up
better at high temperatures, without a doubt. Of course, the best approach
is to address the heat problem more directly, like with a better oil cooler,
or cleaning out the rodent nest clogging your air channels.....

........ More harm is done to mechanical parts in the first few seconds after
start up than in hours of continuous running. The next few minutes
when the various lubricants are cold is the next worst. Once the
engine and lubricants are at operating temperature wear is very
slight. At that point the advantages of synth lubes are not as
significant.
