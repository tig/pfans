Hello all,
   Well, I am going to hopefully be picking up a car in about the next 6
months or so, and lately I have been stepping up on doing my homework a
little.  A family member talked to a german car mechanic at out church
and asked about a 911, since I have been talking about getting one for
ages, and the mechanics response was that they were fairly high
maintenance cars...although they didn't mention what kind of 911 I was
trying for. I am hoping to pick up a good 911SC with a solid service
history, and hopefully 100,000 miles or less.  I know such a car will
require it's share of TLC, and I am planning on taking care of it quite
seriously.  My first question is, would a 911SC really be considered as
a very high maintenance car?  (I know all of these cars have the
potential to be, as the parts aren't exactly inexpensive)  How has the
cost of ownership been for some of the 911SC owners out there as
compared to some of your other cars?  I want a good idea, as I am NOT
going to be cheap about maintenance on the car.
    If anyone cares to share your experiences, I would like to hear
them, so I will have a better idea as to what I am up against.  Thanks
in advance,

Jeremy
