Okay.. hmmm

I have the front mounted oil cooler (It's factory) as well as one
in the turbo tail deck lid (aftermarket). I have the 911S gauges.
On the motor in both English and Deutsch it states that it's a
911t 911s class motor, meaing probably the 2.7 liter.. 

To put this to rest can someone tell me where to look on the block
for the engine number in case what I wrote before (found on some
paperwork) is not accurate..

Thanks again.

Tory

need rear driver tail light (mine has small crack in it).
Source for new seals and the best how to to redo a targa top.
2 sun visors, black
complete front hatch area carpeting, I have it and it's okay but
not perfect, would prefer perfect.

Boy these tools in the tool kit sure get old and nasty looking
after almost 25 years ick.. Maybe get those all re plated?
<shrug..

All the above are needs and if you have any of that stuff lying
around and decently priced please let me know. I say reasonably
priced cause a lot of my money is going into the motor, susp,
etc..

Thanks again, you all are very cool, do Porsche owners say cool or
is that still more of a bud drinkin chevy driver term?

porsches in the garage, whoa that is cool..
