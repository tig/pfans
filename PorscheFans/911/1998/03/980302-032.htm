I have a '97 993 Cabriolet which I've owned since 3/97.  My car is a
weekend driver (2 drives a week mainly on freeways or fast roads).

I'm new to Porsche ownership, and I'm not sure how to gauge its
'designed-in' oil consumption rate.

Here's the latest data.  I had the dealer perform an oil change in 12/97 at
5400 miles.  Everyone tells me that was overkill.  However, I was surprised
that I had to top off at another 3/4 of a quart last week when getting
gasoline, given my limited use of the car.  My current mileage is about
6800 miles.

I've checked, and there are no oil leaks, or no smoke.  The dealer, at my
last service, reported no obvious engine problems.

Am I doing something wrong?  Am I not compensating for the low mileage?  Is
there a potential engine problem?  Any help from the Porsche experts out
there would be truly appreciated.

Thanks.
