Ok Phans I know this is a very unusual request but I am seeking a litte
help form our European members, specifically the German ones. I am going to
be in Germany starting on April 25, and I am planning a day trip to the
Nurburgring on the 26th to drive the famous track, BUT I have no idea if
the place is going to be open. To further compicate matters, I have trouble
with the German language, in fact I dont speak more than bout four words of
it! I did go to their web page, and in fact I sent them an e-mail, but
since it was in English, I suspect they did not bother with it, since I
recieved no response. Is there ANYBODY out there that can confirm that the
track will be open tht day, and that it is not being used for testing or
someother event? I would GREATLY appreciate it if someone could help me out
here.

Any and ALL help is VERY much apprciated!!
