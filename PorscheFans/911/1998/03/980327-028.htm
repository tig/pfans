I start shopping around for a used porsche. I'm looking for a car that is
will be a daily driver. Up to now I've had my eye on 964 C2's (maybe a '93 to
get all the factory fixes for the various engine problems). I like the 964
styling and I'm thinking that a targa top might be fun as well.

So anyhow, I was talking to an acquaintance who hag a '95 993 C2 which 
recently was stolen in NY and he told me that new multilink rear suspension
on the 993 had *greatly* reduced the tail happy tendencies of the 911. (Kind
of ironic for him to say this since after 2 months of onwership he spun out
and went flying backwards in to a wall at 30mph. If I recall it was around 
$35,000 worth of damange). Maid it sound like a night and day improvement.

Pluswith all the other improvements (6 speed, styling etc), he thought that I
would forever regret not getting a 993, especially for a daily driver.

This advice is quite nice, but if I got into a '95 993, I would be so over
budget it isn't even funny. I'm not sure how I'd even broach this with the
SO :-). It most likely would push back my purchase for a while.

Any opinions on this? Is the handling that dramatically better on the 993 
than the 964? Any other reasons why I should stay away from a 964 and try
to scrounge my way into a 993?<<<<

Hi Eric,

I went from a '92 Carrera 2 (964330) to a '96 Carrera 4S (993140).  I loved
the '92 C2 but the '96 C4 has been a greater sweetheart.  I think the 993 is
the ultimate 911 as it gives the driver a bit more in terms of control for
that infamous tail happiness and has a slightly more forgiving ride.  Trust
me, it is not a night and day difference especially on the rear wheel drive
chassis.

The 964 engines had mechanical valve lifters.  These have to be adjusted every
15,000 miles but often go out of adjustment as early as 10,000 or 12,000 miles
and you must have them adjusted when in need.  This is an expensive part of
the service as at 15,000 miles the entire engine/transmission must come down.
All in all, the 993 with hydraulic lifters is less costly to maintain and
might be a better candidate as a daily driver.

Porsche also made some running changes to the chassis right when the '96 993
was introduced.  They beefed-up the wheel bearings and carriers to accommodate
the 18" wheels from the Turbo.  I have heard (unconfirmed) reports that rear
wheel bearings wear prematurely on the '95's.

In my opinion, you should consider the following:

1- If you are going to drive the car daily, think about maintenance costs.
Ask your local dealer or Porsche repair shop how much they charge for that
15,000 mile service.  Also, remember that the rear tires on any 911 last
anywhere between 7,000 to 15,000 miles at best.  The fronts can go at least
20,000 miles.  This is of course if you are not autocrossing or road racing.
Don't forget that oil change, each time you're going to need 9-10 quarts of
synthetic.

2- If you have decided on a 993, try to find a good '96 to take advantage of
the improvements in chassis and the added power (270 vs 282) via the Varioram
intake system.

3- If you are very concerned about the tail happiness of the 911, you can do
one of two things.  You can go to a PCA driver education course in your region
and learn how to control the rear wheel drive.  Or you can go for the Carrera
4 (993 better than 964) and pray.

Good luck!
