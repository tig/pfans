Hi Juergen:

Before you condemn the fuel pump, make sure its supply line isn't
clogged with rust-stuff-junk-garbage at the fuel tank.

Under the front of the car, right by the crossmember are the fuel line
attachments for the tank-to-pump lines. The tank fittings are brass
inserts into the tank that have a very fine brass screen surrounding the
suction tube inside the tank.

Typically these screens gets clogged with dirt and rust and prevent fuel
from being pulling into the pump. Same symptoms as a dying pump,
fluctuating pump noise and uneven fuel flow, all of that stuff. You
should remove and clean these screens before buying any parts. This
isn't fun to do, the tank should be as empty as you can get it.

If the screen is clogged with rust particles, quite likely, this is an
indication that the tank is severely rusted and may nor be saveable.

Frankly, this should be a regular inspection/replacement item in ANY 911
to prevent being stranded somewhere. 911's after 74 have a nylon screen
filter around the fuel pickup that should be inspected or changed due to
fuel quality problems no matter where you live. Sometime I'll relate a
funny story of being in the Arizona desert mid-way between Phoenix and
Palm Springs with a fuel starved 73 Carrera RS Lightweght with this same
problem,..........

Funny now, wasn't then in late November........   :^)

(PS,  Use the Bosch pump, not a Facet !!!!!!!)

Best Regards,
