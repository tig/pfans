Hello, folks:

I have a new-to-me 1988 Carrera, and as the heat sets in here in Florida, I
have some questions about engine temperatures. My car has the non-numeric
temperature gauge; my temp seems to hover just above the first mark up from
bottom of the gauge (the second overall of four marks); anybody know what
temperature the marks indicate? My car is, I believe, equipped with the
radiator-style cooler and fan in the front wheel well.

Since Florida gets REAL hot in the summer (and this is my commuter car so
inevitably will idle in traffic from time to time with the air on), I am
curious to whether there is any benefit to engine temperature and/or
longevity to replacing the catalytic convertor with a "test pipe." I am
more concerned with operating temperature than the slight horsepower gain I
would receive.

Can the DME engine run okay with the cat removed? Can it be adjusted to
pass emissions without the cat as my 911SC did? Or will the better cooler
keep my cool enough as is? I've only got 24,000 miles on the car, and want
to keep it happy.

Any thoughts appreciated

Vic
