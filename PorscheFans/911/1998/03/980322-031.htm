<SNIP>   My mechanics recommends either KYB ($190 for
all 4) or Boge ($410 for all 4).

I have never seen KYB shocks on a Porsche, but I just changed the shocks on
my 1986 300E.  I found KYBs had been installed, and found the source of
suspension noises - the rubber bushings were loose, and allowed clanking
when I hit bumps.  The car had only 102,000 on it total, and I know KYBs
were not factory.  Therefore, the shocks were relatively new.  Jeff, a
great suspension wrench at Grand Tourismo in Atlanta, also told me he
thought KYBs were junk.

I installed Bilsteins on my 911 in 1979, and they still work great.  I have
used Bilsteins on several Mercedes beaters, and drove over 100,000 miles
without noticable degradation in ride.  You get what you pay for.  If you
want to enjoy a Porsche, don't scrimp on something as critical to the
driving experience as the shocks (or tires for that matter).  Out of round
or out of balance tires work shocks as badly as a rough road.  Take care of
time maintenance, and you will not need to maintain the shocks.  My 2c
worth.
