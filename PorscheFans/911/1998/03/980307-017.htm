Don:

Advantages:  Works great and lasts a long time.

Disadvantages:  It costs more, and a few drops may leak past seals
that held back conventional oil.  In brand-new engines, it may
prevent (or delay) the rings from seating.

Personally, I use Redline in all my vehicles (20W50 in the 914/6)
and will NEVER switch back to conventional oil.
