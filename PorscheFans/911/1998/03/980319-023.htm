915 transmissions are notorious for being slow shifters. If you try to rush
it, you will just hurt the transmission.

Racing is another deal altogether. Most pure racing transmissions use
straight cut gears and no syncros. The driver must double clutch to engage a
gear. One of the things that amazes me about a professional race driver is
that they can shift with double clutching faster than I can shift with no
double clutching.

If you really can't live with a slow shifting 915, you could install a
shortened G-50 for something in the neighborhood of $5K. Me, I shift slowly
and enjoy the other aspects of the car.
