First I would like to thank everyone who helped me find a local mechanic
for my 1984 Carrera (74,000 miles). For those I did not call back, I
found a mechanic 2 miles from my house who was also recommended by a
neighbor.

My car runs like a top, but I smell some fumes at low rpms when I have
been lugging it in the canyons and start to accelerate. I don't have
any  smell when I am at idle, nor at any other time. I would like to be
better informed before I have the mechanic take a look at it.

This car was just smogged, ( I hope legally ) and I am wondering if it
might need to be tuned. i.e. Maybe it is running rich in order to pass
the smog check. 

It is a Euro engine which has all of the conversion paperwork. I even
called the Department of Motor Vehicles to see if there were any
irregularities with this car, they said it was legal. I am wondering if
perhaps it would like a higher octane gasoline or an octane helper.

Although I am familiar with older V8's ( Chevy Small Blocks ) I don't
know much about the DME ignition systems. Would you suspect valve
adjustment?, Timing? Any ideas would help.

If anyone has any ideas, I would appreciate your thoughts. I will be
taking it in regardless, maybe I'm just being paranoid.

Thanking Everyone in advance.

P.S. This is a great Forum for Porsche owners, Thanks to however is
running this list.
