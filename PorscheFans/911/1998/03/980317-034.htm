We have just bought a 1979 911 SC as well (this past weekend!) and enjoy 
the heck out of it.  Make sure, as you can see in archived threads, that 
chain tensioners are updated.  Also update the clutch, since the 79 SC's 
fall into the category of rubber-centered (the so-call "exploding clutch" 
syndrome).  Also, we have noticed that the power windows need some lubing. 
 Let me know if you run into anything, perhaps we can exchange info bits.
