Hi all,

As I started this subject, I tought I should try to close it also.

I've studied this with help of others on the list little further and =

found out that the bolts should be installed as Porsche manual =

say, from right side to left, right is the oil cooler side.  =

My engine has been opened before and bolts was installed =

from left to right, e.g. the cap nuts was all on the right, 4-5-6 side.
Actually I doubt my memory somewhat now, I just don't know =

why I wouldn't noticed that some nuts on other side and some =

on the other. I usually make notes about "non-logical" things.

At least in my 3,2 case the right side holes are chamfered, =

left side is not. =

There seem to be a reason for this;
- The chamfer in washer alone is not enough for the O-ring =

  to compress on the non-threaded part of the bolt.  =

  Some of the O-ring would squeeze out between the washer =

  and case if there would not be a chamfer in the case? =

- In the other end where there is threads, the chamfer in the washer =

  and the threads allow enough space for the O-ring to compress.

Damn, here I realize again the lack of my vocabulary, =

quite hard to explain this in English.

I did some "testing" on this. Bought Viton 8x2 O-rings at a cool 2 USD =

each and mounted a bolt "wrong way", cap nut on right side. =

The hole in block sheared nicely the O-ring on left side (1-2-3) and the =

O-ring on the right side (4-5-6) was OK. =

Installed the bolt from right side to left side, there was some compressi=
on

on both end O-rings, and when opened back, both O-rings was OK.

Some of You might wonder what is this dude rambling about these O-rings, =

problem is that to change these little things, the engine has to come a
part, =

and I don't want anybody to get this wrong because of me.

Install those bolts & O-rings as factory say.
