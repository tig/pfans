If you own a C4 and it has the really expensive green anodized pressure
sensor in the traction control pump that tends to leak around the 0-ring...
(the part has been updated- its recomended that you change it before it
dies on you) if yours was replaced; and before it was replaced it spewed
out the brake fluid all over your boot... you may want to check your wiring
harnesses around the ABS unit pump and the traction control units right
around the battery.. if you look about 5cm above the battery and to the
right ..into the channel where there are two harnesses jammed in there..
you may find that some of the corrosive brake fluid is eating away at the
harness tape and eating into the wires... (mine were getting crispy) and a
few were shorting.. I re-wired the harness and re-taped it. It looks good
now, but the problem with  the fluid coming out of the 0-ring is common..
so be aware of that spot.
