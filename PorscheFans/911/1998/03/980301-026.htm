The guy at my local Discount Tire also shrugged off the heat cycling
issue when I purchased by first set of R1's, so I didn't heat cycle
them.  BIG MISTAKE.  At the next time trial, I ran through almost the
complete set of R1's in about 50 miles of track time (down to cord on
one).  Now I was pretty new at this sport, but.....

Try reading the excellent article by Jim Fogerty that appears in many
places on the net ( e.g. http://www.PorscheNet.com/bfgtires.html ).
After presenting Fogerty's article and after many weeks of discussion,
the manager of the Discount Tire agreed to a free replace two of those
tires as a result of the bad advise.  

The BFG representative at the 1997 Porsche Parade held a session where
he answered your question of how to heat cycle them.  He strongly
recommended heat cycling and said to go out and find a parking lot and
drive in circles (aggressively, but no need for squealing tires) for
5-10 minutes in each direction, and then go park the car for at least
1-2 days.  I also understand that some tire shops sell heat cycled R1's.

This has made a tremendous difference in how long my tires last; maybe
2-4 times as long when heat cycled.  I've spoken with some race veterans
that claim they do not heat cycle their R1's, and their tires seem to
last forever.  But for me it made a huge, immediate difference.  Perhaps
the effect is minimized when your driving skills are not very smooth yet
(that's me).

BTW, your tire probably won't have much of a chance to heat up during an
autocross, so I suspect that the advise you received is faulty.
