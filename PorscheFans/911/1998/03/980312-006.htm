Replying to the quiery concerning keeping a daily driver like new
without cleaning and removing paint each time before waxing, I have
enjoyed using Malms products.  If your paint is like new and you want to
protect it and clean it without removing any more than necessary, you
might consider Malms.  Their website is www.malms.com.  I have tried as
many products as I could over the last couple of years and think their
wax and glaze/polishes are as good or better than any others and really
are made for the perfectionist who wants to keep a car in new like
condition all the time.
