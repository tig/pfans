Steve - I think John was talking about the gizmos you buy from
Automotion when you have screwed up the threads on the thermostat. 
Not what you or I would probably call a coupler or connector.

  They are  deeper on their female side so you can grab the last few
hopefully unbuggered threads left on the thermostat, the ones the stock
hose end nut didn't get to.   The ones I once had were aluminum, and
what you really want to do with them is have them welded on so you
aren't depending on just a few threads forever.

However, my experience has been that liberal use of antisieze on
assembly solves the problem adequately if you can initially get the nuts
off without damaging anything.  The nuts are still hard to deal with, but at
least you don't end up with stripped threads after all the shouting and
swearing of getting things loose and off.
