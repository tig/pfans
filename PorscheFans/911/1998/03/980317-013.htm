Good news and bad news.  The good news is that my alternator charging
problem has been resolved, the bad news is that
I don't know EXACTLY how I fixed it.

(As Pfans may recall, I recently had my alternator repaired - new
rectifier and voltage reg.  After reinstalling, alt. warning
light still on, no charge at battery.)

I pulled the alt. again, tested on bench fine (80 amps at 90% load).
With alt removed and all wires insulated, I found that the
alt warning light was still coming on - this should not happen.  I
removed all guages in dash and hunted around for what would
be causing the ground - upon retesting, the light was out!  There
obviously is something back there that caused the ground.

The wiring diagram on my SC indicates a (blue) wire running from D+
directly to the ground side of the warning lamp.  There is
also a red-green wire to the ground side of the lamp from a transistor
in the oxy sensor mileage meter unit.  (This unit is behind the speedo
and has a small reset button on the right side, if my memory serves
correctly) Somehow, I was getting a ground on the red-green, and due to
my fiddling around, the ground went away.  I examined the wires as
closely as possible and could not see any obvious signs of fraying or
damage of any sort.  I used heat shrink on some suspicious connections,
but as I said, I could not recreate the problem!

I do not completely understand the electrical reasons why the alt was
not charging due to the ground but here is the explanation
as I understand it.  The voltage regulator initally acts as a ground so
that when it sees the 12V battery voltage it switches itself
on (via a transistor) which starts the alternator charging.  The ground
disappears and the voltage comes up (to 14.4V) on this circuit 
(and also at the battery which makes its way to the + side of the lamp -
and hence the lamp goes out).   Note also that in this
arragement, if the alternator warning light is defective, the alternator
will not charge.

P.S. for Central New Jersey Pfans - I had the alternator repaired at
Bridgewater Auto Electric 908 526 4060 by "Ken".  He did
not charge me for the retest of the alternator nor the time I consumed
with him on the phone as I tried to diagnose the problem.
(He was also very considerate of keeping the blower fan housing clean
during his repair work as I had just had it sandblasted. For 
a while I had the best looking non-functioning alternator in the country
I suspect).
