Ernie, I had an '84 Carrera which I sold prior to getting my 993.  Car had
135,000 hard miles on it (6-7 race track weekends a year).  New owner
wanted a compression/leakdown test done, 5 cylinders came out fine,
on 6th spark plug was frozen.  Snapped it off trying to get it out, 
requiring an engine removal and top-end teardown to repair.

Shop said that the valve guides were just about at the wear limits, 
recommended changing them.  They indicated ti was normal for this 
engine.   Bottom end of engine (pistons/cylinders, etc.) they said
was beautiful.   

I'd say maintain good maintenance and watch the spark plugs when
you change them; if they bind at all on removal, clean out the 
threads.  Also, don't let them go 50,000+ miles between changes
or you'll increase chances of them seizing.

Hi Fans:

I have a '87 Carrera/3.2 engine with about 113k miles. The car's been well
maintained by PO's and me. It's always had synthetic oil-either amsoil or
castrol syntec(with routine changes @ 5000 miles). It doesn't burn or leak a
drop of oil and has been very reliable. The only perfomance upgrades on the
car, done by PO, are a chip, K&N filter and andial exhaust. The car's used as
a daily driver so I don't generally get on it too badly(ok-maybe once in
awhile. It is a Porsche!).

I've read in B. Anderson's articles and book of very high mileage cars that go
over 300-400K miles before a major rebuild. Sounds too good to be true except
that even my wrench told me he has a customer with a similar car that beats
the crap out of it and it has 265K miles on it with no problems. WOW!

I'm starting to wonder if I'm due for a rebuild in the near future. Any advice
on things I should watch out which would indicate that the engine's ready for
a refresh? What's the group's experience & how long should the engine
typically go before a rebuild?
Here's a thought-should I do an upper and leave the lower until after 200K?
Is a compression and leak-down test enough to accurately predict a necessary
rebuild?
Comments please.
thanks, Ernie
