Jeff,

Just a suggestion of a source for MOMO wheels.  Company is AIC
Performance in Miami, FL (www.aicperformance.com, 305.592.5700).  Their
online site shows a wide variety of MOMO wheels, including the Corse
(350mm, $259) and the Monte Carlo (both 320mm and 350mm, $159).  Adapter
is another $54.  Compare this cost with that of Automotion.

I recently bought a MOMO shift knob from them (Bill Vogeley was the
salesperson).  I was (and still am) undecided about whether to get the
Phantom or the Shadow carbon-fiber look knobs.  Bill said there would be
no problem exchanging the knobs within 30 days, and I expect the same
would be true for steering wheels.  They do charge a 10% restocking fee
for returned rather than exchanged parts.

BTW, the MOMO shift knobs end forever the crush sleeve dilemma when
replacing knobs.  The MOMO knobs fit over a plastic cap on the bare
shift lever and are secured with 3 very small allen-head screws.  Very
solid when installed, but quite easily removed if needed (e.g.,
replacement of shift boot).

Hope this helps,

Robert Herbert
