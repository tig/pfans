I really enjoy the Ruf suspension kit on my C4. I have had it for two years 
on a '91 C4. I have no qualms about it on my daily driver  / driver's ed 
car. It significantly improves the handling near the limits (past the 
middle? ;-) to be lower, more neutral, less understeer. The overall daily 
ride is firm but comfortable. Ruf characterizes the kit as a street/track 
upgrade which is how I see it too. If you don't plan to drive on the track, 
or if you're just starting out and still building toward a harder driving 
style then you might not need all that the kit offers: shocks, rear 
springs, antisways, and front brace. If you want a lowered ride on the 
street then you could get it with just lowering springs or (more $$) with 
springs and Konis. I chose the kit because I planned to change out all the 
suspension bits and wanted replacements that were tuned to work together.

Two things. (1) If the kit has 51k on it you should have someone who knows 
check the shocks to judge how much life is still in 'em. Do shocks decline 
linearly with age/use, or along a curve of some shape? (Mr. Warren?)  (2) 
If the kit you're looking at isn't from/for a C4 it may not be exactly 
right in terms of springs. You might call Lou at the Ruf Performance Haus 
561.743.3201 to ask him about item 1, and/or item 2 if it's relevant, as 
well as your price question.
