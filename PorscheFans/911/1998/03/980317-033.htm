Eric, I recently did this on my '87 Carrera, which I believe has the same rear
suspension setup as your SC.  The "ride height wrench" is worth its weight in
gold... :-).  I got mine from Smart Camber (www.smartcamber.com).

Yes, loosening these two bolts allows a small adjustment (maybe a 1" total
range?) of ride height without getting into the torsion bar spline changes, and
can be done quite easily.  You will find out how close you are to either end of
the range once you start doing the adjustment.  I iterated on mine a few times
and got it to the point where I could go from start to finish on a ride height
adjustment in 1.5 hours.

A couple of hints from my experience:

1. Be sure to disengage the parking brake *and* leave the gearshift in neutral!
 I spent a good hour trying to pry the adjustment plate to the angle I wanted,
in vain, until I tried putting the gearshift in neutral.  It was very easy
after that!

2. Loosen both adjustment plate bolts just to the point where you can use the
ride height wrench to adjust the angle with some effort, otherwise springs and
gravity will undo your careful adjustments.

3. Use a scribe (or pencil, I suppose) to mark the starting angle and desired
final angle of the spring plate on the adjustment plate.  That way you can tell
easily when you're there, and how far you've gone so you can do a 2nd iteration
later if needed.

4. Changing the ride height on one corner affects ride height on all 4.  The
pattern I noticed was that changing (raising, for this example) ride height on
one corner has the following effects on the ride heights of the other 3 (this
assumes the car was well balanced to start):

	- other wheel on same axle: body is raised by nearly the same
	amount as the corner you just raised (I had rear sway bar
	disconnected, but not front)

	- opposite corner wheel: is pushed down slightly, maybe 1/3-1/2
	the amount you raised the opposite corner by

	- other wheel on same side of car: little effect; maybe down
	slightly

You'll notice, for example, if you raise the RR corner first, that suddenly the
LR corner has raised by nearly the same amount, and you're reconsidering
whether to apply the same ride height change to the LR as you were planning,
because it's already raised.  The answer is "yes" -- follow through with equal
ride height changes on both rear wheels.  Doing the LR will restore balance,
and lift the LF up a little, back to about where it was before.  (I didn't do
this the first time, with the result that my ride height was great but my
diagonal weights sums were 300 lbs off.)

All this was not all expected, and it took me a few iterations and 1 corner
weighting to observe how the corners behaved when you changed one of them.

I highly recommend finding someone who can weigh your corners before you start,
after your first iteration, and at the end.  Negotiate with a local shop for
weighings only ($20 - $30 each visit, I'd say), or find a local racer who is
willing to rent out scales or have you come by their house.  I found that you
can do a rough calculation of the spring rates of your suspension (they're
different from year to year, with modifications, etc.) by knowing that to first
order each rear wheel carries 900 - 950 pounds and you can measure roughly the
total wheel travel when you jack the car up (disconnect sway bar first).

I am in process of writing up an HTML version of my experiences for my own
benefit if I go through this again.  But I've been in progress for a few months
now so I can't promise anything being available any time soon....

Good luck!
