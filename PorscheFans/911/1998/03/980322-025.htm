Dear, Rennsport1

The door panels is about the only place where you could use Dyna-Mat in a
911 Series.  Dyna-Mat was design for the big American cars with lots of big
panels to vibrate.  In general Dyna-Mat works really well.  I reduces panel
vibration caused by sound dramatically.  If the weather in your area drops
below 50 degrees, you might want to use additional adhesive.  The Dyna-Mat
adhesive doesn't stick very well to vertical panels in cold weather.

I found in my 90 C4 that the best way to improve the audio was to replace
the mid driver (speaker) with a two-way speaker (coax) and disconnect the hi
freq. driver (tweeter) or install a hi-pass filter cut to 10kHz and 6 dB of
attenuation.

It still doesn't sound like the way I would expect a $68K (when new) car to
sound, but it is at least tolerable now.

Luis
