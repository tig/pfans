Juergen:

I also have a 70T with Webers.  I replaced the factory fuel pump with a
Facet type ten years ago and have no complaints.   The sound is different,
but you do not hear anything after the engine starts anyway.  I made an
adaptor cable to preserve the factory connector in case I later wanted to
put in a factory pump.

I had years accumulation of water and dirt in the bottom of the tank. 
There is a suction strainer inside the tank.  It plugs up easily.  I would
check it first.  If it is grungy, I would clean out the tank as well.  I
used the J.C Whitney 3-stage "gas tank restorer", which works great.  The
process basically puts a plastic liner inside the tank.  I learned about it
from Model A restorers who use it to restore tanks with rust holes in them.
 Ten years and still not problems.  Cost about $25.

Good luck.  Let us know how you finally fix it.
