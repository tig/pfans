Jad,

I agree with you. I believe that synthetics are superior in several areas but
to me the question is whether this superiority needed in a street vehicle. I
believe there resistance to breakdown at high temperatures is a benefit to
engines that run hotter than normal, especially in a 911 Turbo where the turbo
itself is only oil cooled an no provision is made to continue to circulate the
oil after shutdown. There 5W ratings made them better in cold weather and on
cold starts ( not a minor point as most engine wear occurs at start-up ) but
now mineral oils are available in this weight. Perhaps the biggest advantage
comes from its ability to combine both, as in a 5W-50. A pure mineral oil could
never be made to span this range with stability ( I hate saying 'never' ). If
someone feels these are important points for there car and doesn't balk at the
cost of the synthetics them go for it. But remember that cars ran for a long
time on normal oils and as long as you change it often something else will
probably break long before there is an oil related failure. I think that
Porsche ran single weight oil in the 917/30 engines and they worked pretty good
:-)

Note : The opinions above are from listening to many years on this debate and
IMHO - not from being an 'engineer' or 'expert'

************************************************

I am looking for direct comparisons that show synthetics are better, not
info on why synthetics are so wonderful.  If you feel better using them,
that is great and I absolutely don't believe you are hurting your engine, I
am just trying to make an informed, not emotional, decision on what to use.
