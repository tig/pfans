Here is an excerpt from one of Bruce Anderson's emails on this subject

"......The Ventilation Kit Part
number is 000 043 202 52. They have you remove the oval cover on the primary
distributor body to install the ventilation connector into the distributor.
The hose connects from this ventilation connector to the air guide tube
(heater duct) at the other end. They have you drill am 18 mm hole 40 mm to
the right of the tail light ventilation connector which is also in the air
guide tube. There is a grommet for this 18 mm hole and a connector which the
hose is connected to that plugs into the grommet in the air guide tube. The
stated purpose of this hose it to blow cooling air onto the distributor
timing belt, but it also helped to evacuate the ozone which was speeding up
the belt deterioration.

Also during the 1993 model year a modified distributor drive belt was
installed in the distributors of the 911 Carrera 2/4 models to further
reduce
the probability of a distributor timing belt failure.

The little hose that goes through the rear panel of the engine compartment
and disappears is there to dry the condensation in the tail lights and
center
reflector. Al but the very early 964s have this hose as well. The hose and
tail light lenses and center reflector lenses without a lower gasket seal
were added in late 1990. " (end of Bruce Anderson content).


As you can see, the distributor cap itself is not modified. The little belt
should be available from Porsche, and it is relatively cheap. The
ventilation kit is also pretty cheap. To replace the belt, the distributor
needs to be partially disassembled, and ideally cleaned and relubed at the
same time. The trick is keeping the proper relationships between the two
distributor rotors and the proper tension on the belt. In fact, for quite a
while (maybe still?) it was officially recommended that a Porsche rebuilt
distributor be used to be sure this belt was properly installed, and merely
replacing the belt was not condoned. Perhaps this was overly conservative,
because now lots of mechanics will undertake replacing the belt with few
qualms.

    Subject: C4 Distributor


    Hello,

    I took my distributor caps out and found out that my car doesn't have
the upgrade ventilation kit and also that the belt that drives the second
distributor is about to come apart.

    My questions to the experts are:

    #1-Where do I buy a new belt?
    #2- Where do I buy a ventilation kit?
    #3- What distributor caps and rotor should I use if I want to replace
the existing ones?
    #4- How often do you guys replace your distributor caps and rotors in
your 911s and 964s ?

    I really appreciate any input.

    Luis
