Hi P-Fans:
There's been much talk about torque wrenches.  I can't speak for the
quality of Snap-
On, but I've owned Craftsmen and recently purchased one from Griot's
Garage.  I've =

found that Griot's consistently offers the best "stuff" and is somewhat
expensive.  The =

GG model is British made -- not from Facom like many of their other model=
s.
 Unit is =

beautifully made, serial numbered and ergonomically designed.  Wrenchs ar=
e
available =

in 3/8" 5-45 ft. lbs. $137, 1/2" 30-150 ft. lbs. $175, and 1/2" 45-250 ft=
=2E
lbs. $185.  =

Wrenches include plastic case with certificate of accuracy and lifetime r=
e
calibration =

service at no charge from GG. Well, you must splurge occasionally!  Want =
to
borrow =

my wrench--I don't think so!  Griot's Garage: 800-345-5789.  I'm not
related to GG, just =

trying to collect everything they sell.
