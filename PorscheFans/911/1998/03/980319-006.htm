For anyone who missed it, some time ago I posted a note to the effect
that Dennis Simanits for Road & Track penned a very thorough analysis of
the performance differences between synthetics and regular motor oils.
I do not remember which edition it was in, but R&T has an index for each
year which can be searched.  You can get the index via their AOL site
(which I do not have access to, even though I am a subscriber for the
last 20 or so years...which pisses me off).
If I remember his conclusion it was essentially that the syns are good
in extreme conditions, such as very very cold and very very hot, such as
at the track.
I suggest that those who are pondering this great mystery check out his
work.
