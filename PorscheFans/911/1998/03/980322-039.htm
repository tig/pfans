Howdy Pfans -

I need some help and advice concerning the power brake booster
system in my '87 Carrera.  The problem - at least I think it is one -
is that the power assist seems to vanish after depressing the pedal
more than once.  If I haven't used the brakes in a while, the
pedal feels like any other power brake pedal.  But if I pump the pedal
two or three times, it gets progressively harder to depress.  After
three pumps, it feels like I'm back to manual brakes.

This is rather disconcerting on the track!  It is easy to confuse with
air in the lines, since the pedal seems to firm up when you pump it.
I measured the vacuum with a gauge, and it indeed rebuilds very
slowly.  It takes about 10 seconds to recover vacuum in the booster
after depressing the pedal twice in succession.

I traced the vacuum supply line back to a complex junction on the
driver's side intake manifold near the firewall.  My suspicion is that
one of these pieces may be clogged, reducing the "flow" of vacuum
to the booster.  By the way, the booster will hold a vacuum just fine.

Can anyone confirm this type of pedal feel in their Carreras?  Or better
yet, can anyone describe the vacuum circuit?  It must have a metering
device somewhere.  Are they known to cause troble?

Thanks much,

- Brad
