Todd, I have not tried the tires you are thinking about, but wanted to
share a warning with other p-fans as well concerning putting too wide a
tire on a narrow wheel. 

In my case, I was running a 225/55 tire on  6" front wheels (installed
when I bought the car) on the front.  The car would develop a steering
wheel wobble, like an out-of balance tire, at speeds over 65 or so.  I
had the tires rebalanced several times to no avail.  Several people I
spoke to about the problems suggested various remedies involving front
suspension including shocks, tie rods, and other $$$$ stuff.

When time  came to replace the rears, I replaced all four and reverted
to 205/55s as per specs, and the wobble disappeared.  In retrospect, the
wobble was probably caused by side wall flex, especially on a relatively
tall 55 profile tire.

So, while I am by no means a tire/suspension expert and will not be
offended if someone sets me straight on this, while a tire may fit
without rubbing, it still may be too much tire for your rims.

I ended up with Dunlop SP8000s 205/55 front, 225/50 rears and am real
lhappy with the results.
