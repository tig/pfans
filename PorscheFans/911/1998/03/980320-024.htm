Concering oil test, Andy wrote,

" The information in the Comsumer Reports article may be useful for people
who drive their water-cooled cars continuously, 
24 hours a day in stop-and-go city traffic. It is unreasonable,however to
extrapolate from their results to OUR driving habits,
in OUR cars."

No extrapolating here Andy, nor was I advocating the use of one oil over
another. Just thought some members might be 
interested in some unbiased data. I personally use Mobile 1 in all my
vehicles as I feel its cheap insurance for my exspensive
toys. Also, I rode in a New York city taxi ONCE and like felt like a
passenger in an autocross car and that the driver was using
other vehicles and pedestrians for pylons.
