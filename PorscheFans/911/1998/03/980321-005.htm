Greetings-

1)	Does anyone know of a source for a computer program that helps in
sellecting
	gear sets for the 901/911 transmission?

		No idea

  
2)	Also, what is the word on when setting pinion depth and backlash are
necessary
on a trans rebuild.  I've taken my trans down (including removing Diff and
taking input and pinion shafts out of the intermediate plate).


There is a very fancy tool needed to set the preload on the ring-and-pinion
set.  I know of only one non-dealer mechanic in my years of Porsche
ownership who bothered to acquire one.  Most shops mic the old
gasket/shims, put in the same size, an hope for the best.  As far as you
have pulled your trans down, you will need to set the preload.

I have used a trick that gets around the setting tool, but it takes a
little extra work.  I paint one or two teeth on the pinion with machinists
blueing, a special (very thin) paint used in metal layout work.  I take my
best guess for the shim thickness (err on the large side for starters). 
Bolt the intermediate plate to the gearbox, and turn the transmission over
in the normal drive direction several times.  Apply a little load if you
can.  Remove the intermediate plate, and inspect the scuff marks in the
blueing where the ring and pinion engaged.  It should be in the center of
the gear tooth.  Add or remove shims as necessary until the fit is correct.

This trick usually works on the first iteration, because the shim
increments are relatively coarse.

Better still, find a shop with a mechanic serious enough to buy the proper
tool, and pay him/her what it is worth.  The mechanic I knew call this
procedure "blueprinting" the transmission.
