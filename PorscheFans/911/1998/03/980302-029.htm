Fans,

I have a 993 and recently the service manager at my local Porsche dealer =
recommended that I change both my low and high beams to 100 Watt bulbs =
from the stock 55 Watt'ers. FYI, I do not have Litronics. I went to =
order the bulbs from Automotion who warned me against changing the bulbs =
on the lows as they had some experience with melting housings on 964's =
and earlier models using the 100 Watt'ers - on the lows as they are kept =
on for extended periods vs. the highs which are typically on for lesser =
periods of time. I confronted the service manager with this to which he =
responded that this was not the case with the 993, that the 993 Euro =
models are sold with 100 Watt'ers standard for both lows and highs, and =
that he has friends who run this set up with the only downside being =
that they more frequently must replace bulbs.

On a 993 (or other model for that matter) has anybody run with 100 =
Watt'ers on the lows? Has anybody had a "meltdown" with 100 Watt'ers on =
lows or highs? Can running beams with high Wattage bulbs at low speeds =
or while stopped (i.e. in traffic) cause heat build up leading to a =
"meltdown" particularly with the refraction setup on Porsches?

Regards,
