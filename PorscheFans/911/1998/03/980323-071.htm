I am planning on replacing the clutch (and possibly the fly wheel) on my =
90 C4 and was wondering if I could get any ideas on what will this type =
of job involve as I plan to do it myself. For example:  Does the engine =
needs to come out or drop, etc.  Does the transmission needs to come out =
or just dropped a little.  Do I need to remove the exhaust system.

Is there a clutch brand or type that is most recommended?  Is there a =
type of clutch that would last longest?

I've always drove all my cars moderately afraid of the great expense =
that replacing the clutch represents.  To hell with that. I'm going to =
enjoy my car and race it when ever I want and replace the clutch myself =
when the time comes.

I'll appreciate any comments.

Luis
