Luis, a couple of ideas:

1) you have worn pads, which now don't fit flat against the newly cut rotors.
Give it a couple of hundred miles or replace the pads, then see what happens.

2) rotors weren't cut evenly, leading to a slightly warped condition.  You
should be able to feel this as a vibration whenever you apply the brakes.
If not, might not be the problem, although you can check by jacking up each 
wheel, pump brake once or twice, then slowly turn the wheel to see if it's
dragging at any point in the rotation.  Very slight added resistance at one
point 
is probably normal, but noticeable draggin at always one point is indication
of warped/badly cut rotor.

3) How did you get the calipers off?  Did you have to break loose the brake
lines?  If so, did you bleed the brakes afterward?

Hope this helps.

(reply to:)

I had the front brake disks turned (cut) yesterday.  After putting them =
back, I took the car for a drive and found out that if I pump the brake =
pedal, it grabs high (normal like before) but as soon as I drive off, it =
goes back to grabbing really low.

Is there some thing I was supposed to do after turning the rotors.  Or =
could this now be a different problem that just happened to surface =
after this repair.

What could cause the pedal to loose pressure like that?

Any help would be appreciated.
