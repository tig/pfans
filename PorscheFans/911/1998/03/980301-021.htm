I am looking for a really excellent body shop in central NJ.   The shop needs
to be able to repair my car so the fix will not hurt resale.  Most of the body
work, I have had done in the past was good, but the car was never like new and
a trained eye would pick it up.  I have work with Quality Auto Body in Rahway,
NJ in the past (This is/was? the shop that  Ray Catena Motors uses.).  There
work is good, but not excellent.

FYI, My '96 M3 was hit twice last week.  On Tuesday a nice lady rear ended my,
creaming the bumper and spare tire well under the bumper.  Then Saturday the
car was parked  in a legal spot and some guy pulling a trailer redesign the
drivers side from the rear bumper to the front bumper.

Please email private.

Thanks
