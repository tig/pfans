Alan,

I asked a similar question a couple days ago and got some good answers
which I'll pass along to you in summary form (thanks to Eric Brown,
Dennis Kalma, and Jeff Canaday).

Consensus seems to be that DynaMat or a similar, dense, asphaltic
material (e.g., Proform) will provide sound-deadening and
vibration-dampening qualities if used in the doors.  Consider doing the
inside of the door (behind the panel) with a thin (e.g., 3/32") mat so
as to not interfere with door assembly.  Consider also doing the inside
of the outer door skin (will require taking the door apart); you could
use a thicker material here, depending on your level of interest in
sound-deadening.

Eric suggested Crutchfield's (an audio mail-order outfit) for sheets of
uncut material at about $5/sq. ft., or a car stereo shop, which had 3' x
4' rolls for about $3/sq. ft.  Note that there are different grades of
material, presumably differing in density and weight.

Eric and Dennis both suggested also using similar materials on the
interior floor pans, up to about 1/8" thick under the carpeting.  Dennis
noted that a significant amount of road noise comes from sources other
than the doors; thus the floor pans are a likely candidate for
treatment.  The rear firewall has material already behind the jump
seats, which you could play with if you want to get into it.

In general, you also need to consider the general characteristics of
your car.  With a tuned 3.2L engine, you're going to hear the noise no
matter what (hey, that's what we want, isn't it!), especially with a
tuned exhaust and free-flow headers.  Nonetheless, some beneficial
results can be obtained, and, at $3-5 per square foot, I'm going to do
both door panels (inside) and floor pans.

Lastly, concerning speaker placement, my setup will have 4 x 6 Kenwoods
in the rear (60 watt) and Alpine separates in the front (5 1/4"
midrange, 2" tweeter).
Mounting for the tweeter is where the manual window crank used to be;
the newer 993 style cars have a similar setup.  There is a note in
today's list also about improving bass response with a subwoofer setup
which you may want to consider.  Some music will require more definition
than others, and you need to consider power requirements if you really
want full dynamic range.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
