1.   Anyone know a source for alarm switches (with keys. mine is without
key 'cause I lost it) for 1987 911's other than the factory. They want $90
for the switch which seems a bit high. I'm considering locating a wreaking
yard or other source for the switch.

2.   My baby has a rear seal oil leak which will get attention the next
time the motor is pulled (probable this summer before Steamboat Springs
trip) or if the leak gets even close to serious. My question is I have
observed oil collecting in the car behind the front passenger seat and
apparently eminating from the passenger seat track. Now I know 911's have a
propensity to leak oil but IN the car!! Could this oil collection be
related to the rear seal?? The upside is the passenger seat moves quite
smoothly on its well oiled track. Any thoughts would be appreciated.
