Hello everyone!

Now that warm weather is fast approaching, I was wondering if anyone has
any ideas/suggestions on my drivers side electric window which seems to be
very particular about the temperature.

I have a 1979 930 and my driver's side window will come down about 2 inches
and then slow to a crawl.  After much prodding and pushing it will roll
down the remainder of the way.  This seems to happen when the weather
outdoors is still cool or if I'm approaching toll plaza's. ;-)

The window will go up without a problem.  On warm days, it will
occasionally roll down easily.  Is there some way to 'lubricate' the window
path?  Any suggestions?

I am also going to install my Weltmeister Short Shift Kit into my car this
weekend (with my new MOMO shift knob).  If any of you had done this
yourself and found that there is something that I should watch out for or
any helpful suggestions to make this job easier, I am all ears.  The
process looks simple enough and hopefully I won't have to adjust my shift
linkage (insert wishful grin here).


Thanks for listening.
