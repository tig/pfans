Hi, Vic

        In regards to your inquiry on the factory alarm on the 1988 Carrera.
The 1988 model year had a primitive alarm where you had to arm and disarm
the alarm by opening the driver's door and inserting the key in the key
switch located in the door above the locking mechanism.  I guess the
designers at Porsche did not have the modern alarm technology as today, as
well they decided not to ruin the physical looks of the body by locating the
arm/disarm key switch on the exterior of the car.
        The best choice of modern alarm tech would be the Alpine SEC-8059 or
SEC-8049.  These alarms use microwave technology and monitors two zones; the
interior and the exterior of the car.  As well, now you can have modern day
remote access (locking the doors while arming the alarm and unlocking the
door while disarming the alarm) by RF (Radio frequency) remote.  Other
functions incorporated in the alarm is motion and shock features, and
starter cut-off feature.  Since you have a targa like my car, you can park
the car safely with the targa top off.  While arming the alarm, the alarm
interior zone monitoring will re-map the interior zone with the targa top
off, and anything that interrupts the interior will trigger the alarm.

Happy motoring....
