I have used a pressure bleeder (not on my p-car) that had a supply of brake
fluid that kept the reservoir for the master cylinder full.  Real full. 
Like right up to the top.  Then, when you remove the system from the
reservoir to put the original cap back on, brake fluid poors everywhere.

Basically, instead of just a pressure supply, it pressurizes a reservior
that cascades into the one on the master cylinder.  I just assume make sure
the reservoir stays full after bleeding each wheel.  Maybe there are better
systems.
