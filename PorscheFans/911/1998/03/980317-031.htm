Scott,

I'm in the process of replacing mine now.  I've ordered the part,
and will update you if any of the info below is incorrect.

>What is the expected life of an O2 Sensor?

The Oxygen sensor (Lambda sensor) is supposed to be replaced
every 30k miles (suggested Porsche interval).  I don't know the
details of it's wear characteristics, so I'll estimate that it
could last a little longer.  I assume it's some sort of sacrificial
catalytic probe that slowly oxydizes away.  I could imagine that
the instantaneous rate of decay is proportional to O2 level and
this could create some sort of measurable voltage.  That is
an absolute pure guess, I don't really know.

>Does an '87 911 have an O2 Counter that needs to be reset?

Yes.  I believe it's more of a mileage counter since last reset.

>If it does,
>what is it's purpose and what happens to the cars performance if not
>reset?

I think the purpose is simply to track the mileage since the
Oxy sensor was last replaced, as an indication of the Oxy sensor's
operational health.  I don't think the counter itself has any
effect on the operational characteristics of the car.  But, an
ineffective Oxy sensor will affect car performance.  I think an
inoperative sensor will influence the DME control of air/fuel
mixture.  I don't know which way it will shift (I can imagine
either too rich or too lean), and I don't know if it is used
over the entire operating range.  My sensor has been (accidentally)
disconnected for a while.  When I put the new one in, I'll let
you know if I detect a change in performance.

>Are there symptoms that it needs to be reset?

As mentioned, I don't think there are any symptoms due to the
counter.  But, there should be symptoms from a poorly functioning
Oxy sensor.

>Also, where is the reset button?

The reset button is located on a panel behind the speedo.  I
don't know if it's labeled.  I'll let you know when I do mine.

Keep Porsching,
