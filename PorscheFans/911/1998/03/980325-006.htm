Hi Merlin,

I have used the magentic bra, called MagBra, advertised in Pano on my C4, 
off and on.

Pro: (1) Simple to install compared to a vinyl bra that requires elastic 
straps or permanent attachment points. (2) It provides protection over a 
larger part of the area that does get chewed up by road dust than a short 
bra. (3) They do stay on at track speeds, even 120+ on the straight at Road 
America.

Con: (1) My specific pieces were not cut perfectly and so fitting them 
around the hood badge is a pain. You need to be careful to never slide them 
on the hood when placing the bra to avoid scratching, so it's peel and 
place peel and place. (2) There is still a small strip of exposed paint 
between the two sheets that cover the hood. Damned if I didn't get a 
meteorite hit smack dab in the middle. (3) The bra needs to be stored flat 
or the heavy magnetic material will develop and hold a curve. It's somewhat 
delicate in this, and it's tough to find enough real estate in the car to  
 hide them, so I keep them in their storage bag, and then in their 
cardboard in the garage most of the time. (4) As with all bras you can't 
leave them on all the time. They get hot and if there is trapped moisture 
that wicked under them after a rain then you can get some paint 
discoloration. I worried about this a lot - perhaps too much.

Truth is that I use them only rarely since I'm loath to keep them on all 
the time, and I don't have a good place to store them. At the track I used 
them occasionally but worried about keeping them on overnight for the two 
day track event so bagged them after the first day.

Personal experience, of course! I'm sure others have different opinions.

Cheers,
