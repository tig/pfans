Chip Evaul asks if I can "intuit" when I've damaged  a case throughbolt O
ring while installing it to the point where it will leak so I can replace it
before I complete assembling the engine, as opposed to what appears to
be the normal little bit of ring material squeezed out under the special
washer.

I hope I can, but don't know.  The master machinist and engine builder
who showed me his method for putting a case together stressed holding
the bolt end carefully so it doesn't rotate at all while tightening down the
cap nut end.  However, there is no realistic way one can avoid rotation
of the washer on the cap nut end.  If I saw any significant fraction of the
O ring showing, so that perhaps there wasn't still a complete ring of
rubber inside,  I'd probably redo it, but so far it's only been some
occasional fuzz of ring material and I've lucked out on that score with my
motors.  Why this fuzz appears around some washers and not others is
a puzzle, but I count my blessings when I can.
