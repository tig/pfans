Hello P-Fans

I tried to do this once but didn't get too far and ran out of daylight
and had to be somewhere else, etc, etc.  OK, I'm not a mechanic.

A couple of times the local Porsche Service Centre has had to remove the
driver's door inside trim to fix the locking mechanism.  I have a Viper
Ultra 900 fitted and it's integrated with most of the main functions of
the car (remote start, lights come on when it's dark, it talks, etc).  I
recommend Viper alarms if you are looking for one and, no, I don't sell
them.  In the driver's door, the actuator for the alarm sounds
ratcheted. That is, there's a loud "buzzing" sound (it sounds like a
buzz saw on for 2-3 seconds then off) when the locking or unlocking of
the driver's door occurs, either thru the use of the remote unlock
button on the alarm's portable control pad or when you're sitting in the
cockpit and turn the dial yourself.  The sound made when unlocking is a
different (but similar) pitch to the sound made when locking, but both
are buzzes.

If I could take the trim off (they said it takes quite a while) then I
could see what's happening.  Current quote to repair it is $AUD150. 
That's a lot to go into the door for a third time.

Hope someone knows .....

Thanks
