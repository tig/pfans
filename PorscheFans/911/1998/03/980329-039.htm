Hi

I'm reposting this query as I didn't receive a response the first time
and am hoping someone may have some idea what the problem is. My 1980
930 is having a strange idle problem. When the car is first started
(cold) all is O.K., idle is normal and smooth. However once the car is
warmed up, if I turn the engine off, leave it for 5 minutes or so and
then restart it idles at 1200 RPM or slightly higher. It then takes 15
mins + of driving for the idle to return to normal. I thought perhaps
the cold start valve may be causing problems but I wouldn't have thought
the engine would have cooled enough to allow it to kick in. ANy one have
any idea.

Ta

Shane

1980 930.
