    This all happened after you got home from church, eh?

    Hmm...

    Jeremiah 7:24 -- "But they did not listen or pay attention;
    instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil
    hearts. They went backward and not forward."

    Isaiah 46:7 -- "From that spot it cannot move. Though one cries
    out to it, it does not answer; it cannot save him from his
    troubles."

> What is going on?????

    I dunno... Sounds like a pin fell out of your shift linkage, or
    it's in REAL bad need of an adjustment.

    If you crawl under your car and watch the shift rod while
    someone wiggles the shift-lever, the problem may become very
    obvious... Or, in other words, "Seek and ye shall find" (Matthew
    7:7, Luke 11:9).
