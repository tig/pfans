1982 911 Targa


I'm having the strangest problem....While on the Interstate today (but
this has happened twice before; same conditions), I was running
between 60 & 65 mph, oil temp was the first mark from the bottom
(this car does not have degrees, just white marks).  I had to get out
of the way of several trucks, so I eased on up to 80/90 mph and my
oil temp started to rise.  You could almost see the needle moving..
It got up to the last mark before the RED one.  I pulled over and
opened the engine lid; the engine did not seem that hot, but the right
fender was pretty warm (oil resevior location).  I let the engine cool
down and started again.  I did the same thing again 60/65, then eased
on up to 80/90 and it got warm/hot again.

After letting the car cool completely down for several hours, I started
home.  I ran 60/65 mph almost all the way home (for about 50 miles),
when I was within 15 miles from home, I  purposely ran 80/90  to see if it
would happen again, and it did, however, when I got home (even though the
needle was on the last white mark before the red), the right fender wasn't
warm and the engine wasn't all that hot either.

Any ideas???

I drive this car almost everyday around town and it never does this.
