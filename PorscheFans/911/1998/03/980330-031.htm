This ususally is a craked alternator ring and not the actual alternator.

If the alternator has meaurable play in the bearings (you'll feel it) it is the alternator. 
Otherwise the top of the four spokes holding the alternator has cracked.

This is a common enough occurance that I have 3 such rings at the house.

You may or may not have lost part of a fan blade, resulting in an impalance that causes
a fatigue failure usually atht he outer area of the spoke.

It can also be a result of overtightening the alternaotr. I have
seen both failures.

Before blowing the $$ on an alternator dissasemble and inspect for cracks.
If you think about it the alternator bearings woudl have to be REALLY bad to get fan rub.

This ususally results in rubbing to the driver's side of the ring about
2-3 inches form the lowermost point.

FYI,	
Steve
