<<To everyone on the Porsche Fans lists.
I Leonard M. (wicked 9's ) am truly sorry that I caused you to be
saturated with
my post about the wheel close outs. I only sent 2 full posts and one
statement posts.  Unfortunately I sent them to all lists at the same
time. (A big no-no) I
did not know that this causes an anomaly within the list that keeps
posting the ad. I  truly am not selling the wheels myself. I am just
like you all trying to stay inform and contribute every once in awhile.
I thought and still think they are good prices and a good quality
product.  So therefore I thought I would pass the Info on. Now I wish I
hadn't and in some ways I am glad I did.  Let me explain. I love cars
period. Porsches most I have 2, and I like people that share the
enthusiasm that I have for them. I expect to be spamed or whatever it is
called and I can take it. But to think A LOT of people would actually
e-mail me and threaten me and family members is ridiculous. My five year
old can get my e-mail and for her to read threats against me, the
cursing and name calling worries me. If you all (the people that hid
behind false names and threatened me on e-mail) take a innocent mistake
that far then I don't want to be associated with you anyway.  I don't
care about the people that criticized me in a civil way, I have broad
shoulders.  I will live and learn. It will not happen again from me. But
someone will make the mistake again. I just hope that you treat them a
little more civil. I you have or plan to e-mail me with more threats, I
simply wouldn't suggest it. (That only pertains to the people that did
so) For the other Porsche Fans that took the time to read another post
from me thank you for listening, I truly am sorry.>>

After I read this I just had to post.  What is our problem on this
list?  Are some of us five years old?  Do any of us have patience or a
scrap of understanding?  Why is it necessary to belittle and insult
someone for making an honest mistake?  Allow me to let whoever wrote
Leonard in on a little secret - THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN!  New members
join the P-Fans lists everyday and are not around when we send out the
"don't post to more than one list at a time" warnings.  People make
mistakes.  These lists have been an invaluable source of information and
cameraderie for me and a lot of other people, but jerks like whoever
wrote Leonard ruin the experience for everyone.  Do you think he'll ever
post to the list again after being treated like he was?  I doubt it, but
it's not his loss, it's ours.  I truly hope that the person who
threatened Leonard makes a minor mistake someday and really gets torn a
new A-hole.  Or better yet, why don't you send me one of your letters
today- and be sure to include your phone number.  I assure you that what
you get from me will not even remotely resemble an apology.  But to
everyone else, sorry to "waste" bandwidth over this, but someone needs
to do something about the very few rude morons on this list.  Maybe send
them over to the Chevy Camaro and Super Ford site so they can discuss
why straight line 1/8 mile acceleration is far superior to the much
overrated handling and braking characteristics of an automobile.
