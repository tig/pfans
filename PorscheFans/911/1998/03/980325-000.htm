> What does the K&N filter oil and the cleaner do?

    Jeff:

    Unlike conventional dry air filters, which trap particles in a
    mesh of tightly-packed fibers, the K&N filters work by trapping
    particles in oil... The cotton gauze in the K&N filters is only
    there to hold the oil and direct the incoming air across it.

    The advantage is easy to see:  For a dry filter to trap a
    particle of a particular size, the spaces between its fibers must
    be smaller than that size.  The K&N filter, on the other hand,
    can have much LARGER spaces between its fibers... So long as the
    incoming particle just TOUCHES the oil on one of the fibers,
    it'll be trapped.

    Also... As the dry filter fills up with trapped dirt, it flows
    less air and filters less effectively.  In the K&N filter, the
    trapped particles tend to sink down into the oil after they're
    trapped, leaving fresh oil exposed to the incoming air... So the
    filter tends to remain effective even as it collects dirt.

    Because the spaces betwen the fibers of a K&N filter don't fill
    up with trapped dirt, the filters can be cleaned and re-used...
    So to answer your question, the cleaner is used to remove the
    old dirty oil from the filter, and the filter oil is applied
    after cleaning to "recharge" the filter.

    Once a year or so... About as often as you'd replace a standard
    filter.

    Yes... So if your car doesn't have an engine-management computer
    that'll adjust the mixture to compensate for the increased
    airflow, you'll need to re-tune your engine to take advantage of
    it.

    What you read was a description of a problem that someone had
    with K&N filters on his carbureted car... Those filters are
    exposed on the top of the engine; in a heavy rain, they can get
    soaked with water and even allow water to flow directly into the
    cylinders.

    This is a Bad Thing, and K&N knows it... So they sell
    "Watershield" covers that completely solve the problem.  The
    person who wrote that message that you read should have been
    using them.

    If you have a fuel-injected car and you're putting a K&N filter
    into your existing airbox, you don't have to worry about this at
    all... The airbox will shield the K&N filter just as well as it
    shields the stock filter.

    Just these:

    If you are putting K&N filters on Weber carbs, use the
    Watershield covers.

    DON'T clean your K&N filters in your automatic dishwasher.

    DON'T dry them with hot or compressed air.

    DO re-oil them THOROUGHLY... Too much oil is preferable to too 
    little.

    DO use a little grease to seal the edges of the filter to the 
    surfaces they sit on... This applies to dry filters, as well as 
    K&N filters.
