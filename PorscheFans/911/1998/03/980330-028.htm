To the individual(s) seeking opinions from 911 owners regarding the cost =
of maintenance.. I have an 1980 911 SC Targa.  I bought it used with 112K =
on it, the PO had just replaced the clutch and the tranny about 3 months =
before I bought it.
Since I have owned it I have had oil changes done in conjunction with =
maintenance inspections every 5k miles.  this runs about $92.  expensive =
if you consider it just an oil change, even if it is 14 quarts, but the =
inspection aspect of it makes it worth every penny.  This way I keep =
informed of things that are coming up as well, so I am hopefully not =
surprised by anything.  At 15K intervals I have a major tuneup done.  =
this consists of oil change, inspection and valve adjustment plus =
anything else that may pop up.  fortunantely at my last major, nothing =
"popped" up, that cost about $500.  For a Porsche, I believe this is =
normal.  (If you are spending this much to maintain a Honda, you have a =
high maintenance car)
Yes this is much more than I spend on my Toyota, but did anyone buy their =
Porsche to save money????  Overall I consider both of my cars to be =
relatively low maintenance.  Meaning I pay for regular scheduled service =
and not a whole lot more.  
I get a lot of enjoyment from driving my 911 so I don't mind keeping it =
maintaned.

I think you need to ask yourself about the reliability of the car, that =
is what creates surprise expenditures, maintenace is predictable.  =
Incidentally, my 911 has been very reliable, IMHO.
Good luck
