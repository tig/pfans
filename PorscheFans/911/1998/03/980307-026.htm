Jeff,

<< I posted the question about which tires would be best suited for my '73
911T Targa.  I just bought the car and it has Pirelli 185/70 R15's on it.
Some people told me 195/65 R15's while others told me 205/60 R15's.  What do
you have on your "72 911S Targa? How about the '73 911 RS? (or does that have
different wheel wells?).  Do you have any other comments on this subject?
 Thanks in advance,
 Jeff Fuller

A 205/60/15 street tire should be OK unless your car is very low, in which
case it might rub in back over bumps. 195/65 or 195/60 would be fine, or if
your car is not too low the 205/60s will look and work great.

For SCCA autocrossing with the stock 6" wheels I have used 205/50/15s
for a long time, and 225/50/15 last year (BFG R1s only will work in that
size). 
If you live in an area with nice
smooth roads the 205/50/15 will be a good street tire but your
engine will rev a lot on the highway and you may bottom out a bit
over bumps, driveways, etc.

The "RS" has flared rear fenders with 9" wide wheels and 7s on the
front. I hope to run 225/50/15 on the front (now has 205/55/16)
and 245/50/15 or 245/45/16 on the rear.
