Indeed Porsche did produce a production aircraft engine for Mooney. The
Mooney PFM had a unique single lever power control instead of a throttle
and propeller RPM control separate. It used a dual plug variation of the
911 engine. Unfortunately it was short lived and is now highly prized on
the used market.

Subject:       boxer engine = airplane motor - Filters

Dave made an interesting observation about an air cooled boxer being 
similar to an aircraft engine. Indeed it is.  Curiously enough about 
20 years ago (I think) Porsche was offering a version of the 911 
engine called the "phlugelmotor" (spelling is probably wrong). It was 
offered as a powerplant for light aircraft as an alternative to 
Lycoming and Continental. I saw a Cessna with one, and I've 
never heard what happened. Obviously withdrawn.  Anyone know the 
story?

Andy, I agree with your point on the filter. You took the notion to 
its limits.  In the real world, I'm not sure that the limits prove 
much except that a simple explanation is not always appropriate when 
dealing with rocket scientists. [:-)

I'd be a lot more confident if K and N came up with some reason why 
their filter improves performance. For instance if they had cunningly 
researched the airflow and contrived to build a surface pattern which 
enhances the flow thereby easing restriction without diminishing the 
capacity to filter small dirt particles, I'd be happier.

As to the interesting note regarding K and N on earth moving 
machinery, I suspect that K and N never designed their filters to 
operate in such an environment. The manufacturer of the machinery 
knew where that particular engine was going to work and provided 
exceptional paper filters as a matter of due precatuion. I don't 
fault K and N for anything on that account. 

In the final analysis, I replace my paper filters often. Up here they 
cost about 50 bucks.  That is a tiny fraction of what I spend on 
tires and cheap insurance against a costly rebuild.
