I just purchased a 1981 911SC - the previous owner said he always warmed =
up the motor for a few minutes before driving.  I question that =
practice, but in trying to drive the car after only a minute or two of =
warm-up, I find that it will miss and only run OK after the engine oil =
has warmed-up.  My question is what is going on?  The manual says I =
should be able to start the car and go.   Another thing, I can't =
downshift into 1st gear unless I'm going about 5 MPH -- transmission =
problem?
