Hi fans,
I'm new to my car, and we are just getting to know each other, although i
have had others in the past.  I have some questions and would appreciate
answers from those more knowledgeable in these areas.
1) how big a job is it to add a turbo, how expensive, who does it (in the
long island, ny area)       and  what brands are available.  I understand
that the high compression engine is not    compatible with turbo
charging. does that mean that major changes have to be made     
internally to reduce the compression? 
2) i long for the old porsche sound, and my c4 is just a bit to docile
sounding. Any       recommendations on exhaust system changes to give
that more throaty sound?
3) the shifter boot is beginning to show wear. Its the blue leather
variety.  Where do i get        another and how difficult is it to
install. Does the whole center console have to come out?
4) my car doesnt have a cassette deck (i have the cd changer) yet i have
the cassette holder in    the console, due to the original radio that
came out.  I took out the cassette holder hoping i   would be left with a
nice pocket to hold change, etc. but instead im looking down at the  
handbrake mechanism.  Is there a non cassette holder that slips into
place. any idea of the   cost, and part number. Is it from porsche or
aftermarket.  
5) Can anybody recommend some good accessories, and catalogs for the
911/993?
6) the 1995 (unlike some other years) just says CARRERA on the back deck.
No c2 or c4.  How    can you tell a C4 on the road without the C4
designation on the back deck?

Thanks Guys for any information you can provide.
