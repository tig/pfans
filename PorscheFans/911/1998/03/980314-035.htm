I put one in the left (driver) side for a while and it was fine, but
I really hated how cramped it was down there.

Ended up putting it in the AC/contraband bin.  Much tidier, I must say,
and *possibly* better for weight balance.

Also, due to advice from this list, I had the hole which goes into
the passenger footwell welded shut so there is no chance of the Optima
joining me in the cabin under extreme circumstances...

It's definately worth the surprised looks I get when I access the
battery.  It looks like it was designed that way with the hinged
cover and all.
