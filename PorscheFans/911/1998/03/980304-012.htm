Greetings Pfans,

Posted yesterday but didn't show up. Let's try again:

I need some advice on my ongoing interior renewal of a '77 911S Coupe.
Specifically, I need to know:

1) if the door panels from a 1993 C/2 Cabriolet (including panels,
pullstraps, top trim and pocket covers) will fit in a '77, and

2) if the rear deck/seats from the Cab will fit (I think they may
require some mods, such as relocating the metal brace in the vertical
center of the rear deck, and possibly drilling holes for seat belt
attachments on the horizontal upper deck).  Any other issues?

3) will the dashboard fit?

It is my impression that anything up to the '94 cars is quite similar to

the older models, but I am not sure about all the differences between
coupes and targas/cabriolets.  I know the rear quarter panels differ
because of structural supports in the latter, but don't know of
differences in the seats and deck.

A general question:  the 'dead pedal' on the driver's side footwell
seems to be held in by pop rivets.  Is the best way to remove these
by drilling them out or is there a better way (don't want to start
prying and end up crying!)?

Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated, and thanks to those

who have already made suggestions about general restoration tricks.
