Hello,

I have a '86 targa that needs some targa-related help.  Here are my
problems:

1)	I need to adjust the driver's side window's position relative to the
targa top's side seal.  Right now its back edge is too far towards the
center of the car and too high.  Is this procedure easily explainable?

2)	I recently had the targa bar repainted (which necessitated removal of the
rear seal).  Prior to this work, leaving the car outside on a rainy day was
no problem.  Now, after I received the car back, a rainstorm causes a small
lake to form in the passenger side (only, fortunately) rear footwell.  All
of the seals seem to be in good shape. The rear seal is intact, however the
fabric on the sides of the rear seal (where it hits the back of the door
window glass) is worn -- rubber behind the fabric seems to be in fine shape.

	Here's the odd part about my leak, however.  It appears to spontaneously
soak the floor.  In other words, I cannot find any obvious drip/leak.  The
seats (front and rear seatback) remain dry.  The only thing that I did
discover is dampness under the rear seatpad.

	So, does this sound familiar???  If so, let me know your solution.  I don't
have a garage and am getting my car back (from getting its targa top
reskinned) today.

Thanks,

Darrin Sacks (darrinsacks@ibm.net)
