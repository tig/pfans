I am having an intermittent problem with my '68 911 which drains down my
battery power, and I suspect the ignition switch. I have installed a
battery disconnect which I use whenever the car won't be driven for a
week or more, and when I reinstall it (it has a by-pass to keep my CD
player memory settings and clok accurate), it starts fine. However, when
the car sits for just two or three days with the battery fully
operational, I sometimes, but, frustratingly, not all the time, do not
have enough battery power to start the car. I just get the clicking
solenoid sound, and have to hook up my battery charger to get a start.
Once it has run for awhile, it restarts just fine. Sometimes, I get the
solenoid clicking for 15-20 seconds, then the starter kicks in.
Anybody have any suggestions as to what the likely problem is? A friend
suggested the ignition short, which is common when a lot of extra weight
is put on the keychain, as the PO did (he was a plumber whose keychain
looked like it could unlock every residence in Denver).
Thanks,
Luther

Hi Luther, Pfans

Th problem sounds a lot like what I ran into with my 73 Targa.  I would =
shut off the car and go back a few hours later to find the batteries =
(have 2) dead.  I had the system tested and found that it was a bad =
diode in my alternator.  So when the car was running The alternator =
charged the battery.  Once the car was turned off the the bad diode =
would create a small voltage drain which in time (few hours) would drain =
the battery sufficiently to create a no start situation.  I had another =
alternator installed and my problem is now gone.  Havew you alternator =
checked before doing any replacement of ignition switches or wiring =
work.  Hope this was a help.

Good luck
