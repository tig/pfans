Ray and Pfans,

Thanks for your reply. None of the three answers apply to my problem though.

The car has brand new brake pads that the PO had installed about two months
ago at my request before purchasing the car.

I had the rotors turned because they were warped so they were vibrating
quite a bit when applying the brakes.

I took the calipers out without loosing up the brake lines.  Very carefully.

So, I am suspecting that the brake master cylinder might be allowing brake
fluid blow by.  The wear thing though is that the brakes were perfect until
I took the disks out, have them turned and installed back.  Completely
unexplainable.

I put 25 miles on the car today.  The brakes are grabbing dangerously low
but again, if I pump the brake pedal, they grab high and nice for a few
seconds.

Can anyone help?

Luis
