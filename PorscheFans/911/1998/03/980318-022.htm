Same here.  I bought my car at 54K, and shortly afterward had the
60K service, at which time I assume the O2 sensor was replaced and
the counter reset.  I now show 98K and have never seen an indicator
light.  Hmmmmm, maybe I need to debug this a little.

Let me know if you hear of anything.

Specifically, what was the effect.  Did the mixture lean out
when the O2 sensor was connected, or did it get richer?  Was it
just at idle, or at higher RPM?  I'm just wondering the extent
of the sensors influence.

Keep Porsching,
