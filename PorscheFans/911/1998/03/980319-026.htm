Hi, all; 3 questions for the experts:

1) My new-to-me 88 Carrera is being a little balky about starting;
occasionally the first turn of the key will get me only a click, second
turn she starts right up. Of course, she behaved fine at the dealer, who
checked and tightened the connections and ground anyway. First sign of a
starter going south? Something else?

2) First time out in the rain yesterday ... and my temp/pressure gauge
fogged up while the others remained clear ... something I can seal a little
better by pulling it out or just live with it?

3) Does anybody make a hard top for a Targa? I know Saratoga made a smoked
plexiglass top years ago (no idea if it was any good), but it would seem
someone could make a hard, non-folding top, maybe covered in vinyl to look
right, that would solve the flexing, creaking, leaking characteristics ...
not that I'm suffering from coupe envy or anything. Okay, I am. Hell, I'd
buy one if someone made it. Corvettes and Ferraris have them ... why not
the 911?

Thanks for any input!
