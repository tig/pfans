Hi,

Hmmmmm... did I spy my name in there....


Thanks, but I've already got everything sorted out - I just installed
a set of 993 Cup wheels (7-1/2 and 9 by 17) with SP8000s. Tires are still
greasy so I'm reserving comment so far! The car LOOKS fantastic.

My H&R springs are being installed next Thursday. I waffled back and forth
about installing them myself, then decided that I didn't really have a safe
way of removing & reinstalling the lower rear strut mounting bolts. Oh well.

Cheers!

Ross
