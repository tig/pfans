Thought I would pass along the following information which I received:
Good morning everyone,
I just received this note.  I thought you may benefit from it.  "I have
just been informed of this new scam that is quickly spreading across the
United States.  It is being used by criminals in prison and jail to rip you
and your phone company off.  I called the ATT customer service and found
out that it is true.  If you have any questions,  call ATT.  Please pass on
to all of your employees, friends and family..  I received a telephone call
from an individual identifying himself as an AT&T Service Technician that
was running a test on our telephone lines.  He stated that to complete the
test I should touch  nine (9), zero (0), pound sign (#) and hang up.
Luckily, I was suspicious  and refused. Upon contacting the telephone
company we were informed that by pushing 90# you end up giving the
individual that called you access to  your telephone line and allows them
to place a long distance telephone  call with the charge appearing on your
telephone bill. We were further informed that this scam has been
originating from many of the  local jails/prisons.  Please "pass the word".
