<<I would like to install a new boost gauge in place of the clock on my
86 930.  I know I can buy the gauge, but how is the sensor hooked up? 
How does the factory gauge work? Is it electric (my guess) or
mechanical? I have heard mechanical gauges are more reliable.  If I
wanted to install a new gauge (either electrical or mechanical)>>

I have done this on my 930 and have been really pleased with the
outcome.  Buy the VDO that is made for the car, and spend the extra $50
on the install kit with the better connectors.  All the power comes from
the wires already there for your clock.  The boost part of the gauge
ties right into the hose that is already behind your dash for the vacuum
part of the process.  Very easy, very accurate, looks factory.  Bought
mine from Todd Zuccine BTW.  Try him for the parts.  Excellent prices nd
great knowledge about the car.  # is: 1-602-816-9911
