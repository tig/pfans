Several questions have been raised about the proper use of racing gas
and whether avgas is appropriate in these cases.

FWIW:   There are a number of significant differences between race gas
and avgas that will affect how you car will run. They are not the same
product and may not solve a detonation problem that same way.

The octane rating of aviation fuel is measured under different
conditions that automobile engines are. For example, 100LL, a commonly
available grade of avgas is rated at the Motor rating. 100/130 Leaded,
is rated with the assumption that a pilot has manual control of the
mixture so that the first number, 100 is the "Lean mixture method"
derived from ASTM D2700. This tests the fuel's anti-knock capacity at
12.6:1 mixtures, or stoichiometric. The second number, 130 is based upon
the ASTM D 909 test which is a "boosted" figure based upon the full-rich
mixture required at 18K feet or above.
Its apples and oranges, trying to compare the chemical and physical
properties of these two dissimilar fuels. Unocal's racing gas of 104
octane, a very common race gas, is rated at 112/160 using the above ASTM
testing procedures.

Other issues are distillation curves and lead salts in 100/130. The
vapor pressure of avgas and racing fuel's are quite different and the
lead content will do nothing for plug life. The bromide salts in avgas
used for lead scavenging are corrosive to metal fuel systems parts as
well.

Racing gasolines have lots of light-end aromatics that provide crisp
light-off of the combustion process. This prevents the mushy-feeling
acceleration that can occur by using a fuel with the wrong
characteristics or too high an octane for the application.

Try using a 108+ octane leaded racing gasoline in your 9:1 car and see
how that feels!! Unless you have a compression ratio over 11.5:1 or
running high boost levels in Turbo-cars, you will be surprised   :^)  No
magic bullets here.

Last point, if you do decide that racing gasoline is the answer to some
problems you're having, try the unleaded fuels first. Unocal, Sunoco and
VP, all manufacture an excellent unleaded racing gasoline that will work
just fine in cars requiring this grade of fuel. Consider using racing
fuels when compression ratios are over 10.5:1 on single plug and 11.5:1
using twin-plug ignition systems.

Hope this helps a little,   :^)
