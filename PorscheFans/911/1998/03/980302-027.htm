I have the following items that I'm giving or trading
away. I'm not in the car business and don't want to
hasle with selling anything for money. The recipient
pays the shipping via UPS.

What I Have:
----------
1. New unopened copy of Bruce Anderson's book
the new edition.

2. Used decklid and tail from my 92 C4 complete with
all wiring. I replaced it with a fiberglass decklid and
RSA tail. The color is Grand Prix White.

3. Four stock wheels and tires from my 92 C4 all in
very good condition.

4. 2 Power seats from same car. Everything works and
is in excellent condition. Both driver and passenger
seats.

5. One totaly unused R1 in 235-45-17. Been sitting in
my closet for 6 months.

6. Used copy of Frere's 911 story 5th edition. I have the
sixth edition now.

7. Used Momo Competition wheel in excellent condition.
I'm back to the factory airbag wheel for now.

8. Blau Stuttgart Radio (stock from my 92 C4).


What I Want/Need:
---------------
1. Sparco America seat and aluminum side mount kit.

2. A pair of new rear rotors for my 92 C4.

3. A set of brake pads for all four corners of my car.

4. A PCA/POC legal roll bar for my car. Preferably
the bolt in type with fire extinquisher mount.

5. PCA/POC legal 2.5lb fire extinguisher and mount
to fit the passenger seat in my car which is a Sparco
Pro2000.

6. Any PCA/POC tee shirt in XL which is unused.


Give me a ring at 415-597-2376 (Day) to discuss
or email me. I will give the stuff away on a first come
first serve basis (to be fair) to the person that has what
I want.
