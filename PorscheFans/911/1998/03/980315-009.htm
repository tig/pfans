Hey I just though I would tell you guys about a place I found that sold =
me all of my parts for my 1977 911 restoration project.  These guys gave =
me the best price anywhere and they also got me my suspension kit for my =
C2.  If anyone is interested take a look at them at www.gfs1.com .  They =
also sell a lot of used Volvo and Saab parts too.  I guess they are =
pretty big but what got me was there prices and friendliness.
