My '81 SC has the same unit, I believe, and you should be able to have
it repaired for a couple hundred bucks, or convert to the manual
controls and not have to deal with it again.

> Hello P-Fans,

> I have a 1979 930 with the 'climate control' dial box down in between
> the
> front seats.  The unit was only operating in On/Off fashion.  I had my
> wrench take a look at it and he said the unit was shot.  The cost to
> replace the unit is $1,300 + $200 labor.  In the meantime, he disabled
> the
> unit and enabled the little lever that sits next to the dial box
> (emergency
> heat control I believe).  He said that I would be able to control the
> amount of warm air that will come into my cabin this way.  This was
> fine,
> but I quickly realized that the heat only stays on now, no matter if I
> raise or lower the lever arm.  This is okay for the winter, but with
> the
> warmer weather coming around the corner, I was hoping that someone on
> this
> list would know of a fix to this heating problem that won't cost me
> $1,500.
> Is the dial box repairable by a DIY'er?
> 
> Thanks in advance for any alternate solutions to this heating problem.
