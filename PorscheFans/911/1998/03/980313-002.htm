Jeff,

Obviously it has been quite some time since you've visited us in 
South Boghollow, ME. We've paved the streets with cobblestones and 
built brick sidewalks all over town. I'm also very happy to report 
that the twenty three shoppes in downtown Boghollow that are selling 
lobster traps and buoys to the folks "from away" are making small 
fortunes. And because of that Boghollow smells much better.

Got tah go milk.

Pete
