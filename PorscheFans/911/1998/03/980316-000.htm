Tory,

Welcome to the list from another newbie 911 owner.  I read through all
your questions and didn't see a single moronic one in the lot!  I will
address those issues I can and leave the rest for more experienced
PorscheFans.

Bolts should not be loose!  I would worry not so much about the prior
wrench as about the one who did the pre-purchase inspection.  When I
bought my car, with just under 90K miles, I had a shop look for such
things, as well as the standard compression/leakdown/oil
lines/belts/cables/body damage/etc. tests.
If these tests haven't been done, it is a good idea to have them done
now, especially if you plan on time trials and similar events.

You will be hearing a great deal about the chain tensioner issue with
the 2.7 liter engine.  You did not mention the mileage on the car, but
be aware that this is a special source of concern if these have not been
updated.  Valve guide wear is another major potential problem area, and
should be checked if it hasn't been already, especially with the oil
leaks/smoke that you describe. Also beware of rust in a '74, built
before the days of zinc-coating on body panels.

>2) I need some good factory manuals for this car now so I can get
>things torqued right and not mess anything up, etc.etc..

I have found a couple of spec manuals useful at reasonable cost.  The
Technical Specification manual for a '74 is part number WKD.422.121 and
should cost under $10.  Likewise, the 'Parts and Technical Reference
Catalog, 911 Models 1974-1989' illustrates nicely the component parts of
various systems and has some useful technical tips (about $8).  You can
try MY Porsche (www.my-porsche.com, 800.655.3280) or any of a number of
other vendors.

True factory manuals are quite expensive and presuppose a significant
amount of prior mechanical, and specifically Porsche, knowledge.  Access
to Porsche specific tools is also suggested for many procedures.  A '74
will make use of Volumes 1-6 (1-2 for '65-'71, and 3-6 for '72-'83).
These will cost somewhere around $375.  The much-maligned Haynes manual
for the 911 is modestly helpful, often being more useful after one has
done a procedure previously (in which case, it is largely irrelevant!).
Still it is more useful for some things than others, and has some decent
illustrations (about $15).

The one book (of many) that I have found most useful is Bruce Anderson's
'Porsche 911 Performance Handbook', 2nd edition (about $22).  If you
haven't already heard that name (often spoken in hushed tones), you will
many times over in the coming months.  The book is very useful for a
history of the 911 series cars, and especially detailed on engine design
changes, problems, and rebuilding.

> 5) any other tid bits for a new 911 owner..

Join Porsche Club of America (PCA; 703.922.9300) and you will get their
monthly magazine (Panorama), which contains a technical column and a
great deal else.  Ask about their "UpFixin' der Porsche" volumes, and
consider getting the index ($5) to these collections of Panorama
technical articles.  Your regional PCA probably also has a monthly
newsletter.  Excellence magazine is another good, monthly source of
information.

I assume since you posted your questions here, you are getting the
PorscheFans daily digest for the 911.  There are many, many
knowledgeable people out there who freely contribute their expertise on
a routine basis (Thanks to all of you!!).  I have found that saving
these digests and reading or searching through them consistently adds to
my knowledge of all aspects of the 911.

Lastly, if you are browser-enabled, a good Porsche site to start with is
'The BIG Porsche link' (wholesaler-usa.com/rennspeed/por_link.htm).
Surf around the sites and especially the PCA regions and all manner of
technical and other information is yours for free.  (Warning: You are
now entering the Porsche zone; prepare to be absorbed...).

I'll leave you with this overview and let the more knowledgeable members
address some of your specific concerns.  Best wishes, and enjoy your
car!  WHOOOHOOOO....
