I have a wrecked 1980 911 SC Targa shell(uni-body) for sale. The car was hit in the rear and seemed to bend the chassis slightly. There is slight misalignment of the targa top and passenger door. From behind the seats forward, I would say the car is in excellent condition.


I plan to rebuild the car, but do not have the time to straighten the chassis, so I plan to sell this body and buy a good shell.


	-->	Does anybody have a line on one???		<<--


I think this would be a good parts mule for someone who had a front end collision, or someone with time and body equipment. 


Currently, I am taking parts off the chassis, and do not have a set time when I will be done. If interested, I could speed up the removal.


If interested, send me an email. I can email pictures of complete car and if serious, send pictures of specific areas (damage) of car.
