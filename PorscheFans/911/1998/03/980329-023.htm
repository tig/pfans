Howdy Pfans -

Thought I'd post the solution to the brake problem I've been chasing for
a year now in my '87 Carrera.  Symptom was inconsistent pedal feel,
sometimes "mushy", sometimes "firm".  Problem was that the vacuum
line to the power booster was clogged.  

This problem is deceivingly similar to gas in the brake lines, since as
you pump the pedal, it gets firmer.  What was actually happening is
that I was exhausting the vacuum supply to the power booster, and
after two or three pedal pumps was down to unassisted "manual"
brakes.  This obviously makes the pedal seem firmer.

I did about everything you can do to a brake system - caliper seals, 
master cylinder, new pads, flush fluid, and bleed, bleed, bleed.  Tried
the traditional method, the suction pump method, the gravity method,
the pressure method.  Man, I can bleed brakes!  And bleeding 
sometimes helped.  Sort of.

To diagnose the problem, just attach a vacuum guage to the supply line,
and watch how quickly it recharges.  Mine took 10-15 seconds.  An easy
spot to tap into the line is beneath the floorboards where a 12" section
of the line is rubber, or back in the engine compartment.

The clog I found was at a plastic check valve at the intake manifold, driver's
side, near the firewall.  Apparently someone had used silicone or something
in the hoses, because the check valve was filled with grey rubber flakes.
Clearing the flakes solved the problem.

Now I've got REAL brakes.  Yippee!!  Yahooo!!!  Yes, Yes, Yes! 

Can anyone appreciate how fabulous this feels?  A chronic, nagging
problem with the Porsche is solved?  Yes, I'd bet that every one of
you can appreciate exactly how it feels!

Cheers,

- Brad
