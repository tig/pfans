To make a mineral oil multiviscosity, you have to add viscosity extenders.
These viscosity extenders are not good lubricants and actually reduce the
'lubricity' of the oil. They do make it flow more consistently through wider
temperature ranges. They also break down over time. A synthetic
'multiviscosity' oil, as long as the required range is not too great (like
5W-30) does not require any viscosity extenders, and so its lubricity is not
diluted as in the equivalent mineral oil. Under normal use, and with
frequent changes, a mineral oil is certainly perfectly adequate for almost
all automotive engines. I personally like the extra margin of safety a
synthetic provides, and also the longer drain intervals. A 5W-50 synthetic
probably has a good dose of viscosity extender to get this range, and hence
is probably likely to change its characteristics over time more than a
synthetic without viscosity extenders. It may also have less lubricity, but
I don't know.

This does not mean much. A race car engine is designed to run optimally over
a much narrower temperature range than your street car, and a single weight
mineral oil is the only thing that made sense especially given what I said
above about reduced lubricity from adding viscosity extenders. Nowadays
almost all racers use synthetics. Since many of us drive our Porsches in the
manner of a racing car (wide open throttle / high rpms) the extra insurance
of a synthetic makes sense.

Same here!
