 Buddy,
 
 How soon are you installing the tires?  I'd like to know what you think of
 them. I know a few people who run the 17" R1's and they are very satisfied
 with them.  I heard recently that there would be 18" R1 or R1 type tires
 available this spring.
>>>

I will be running the R1's at Mid Ohio on May 8-10, I have heard that the
17" would actually be better than going to 18" don't remember the reason
why.  For me it works good because my snow tires are on 17" Cup wheels
so I will put the R1's on the Cup wheels and haul them down to the track.
You don't want to run the R1's on the street too much because the tread
rating is real low and you will burn them up quick!

>>>>
 
 As far as were my friend drove the 996  I really can't say. Sorry.  But he
was
 very impressed with the speed of the car and the rigidity of the "frame."  He
 also said that it was roomier, he pointed out that you don't bump elbows with
 the passenger.  He felt he seats were much more comfortable.
>>>

I would be interested in the 996 turbo if they make a cabrio version and 
increase the power, we will see!

  
 Someone asked about breaking in a twin turbo.  My tt currently has 28,000
 trouble free miles on it.  
>>>

Glad to hear you are driving it, my 97 delivered march 97 now has 15,000
miles on it!
 
Speaking of Vipers I test drove one the other day and the car is cool but
totally different than the tt.  Viper is very crude, cramped, loud, ect... not
a car you would drive 15,000 miles/year but I wouldn't mind owning one.
Talking to the sales guy he was going on about how it was the fastest car
blah, blah, blah and of course I said hey my turbo out there will beat it
to 60mph no problem.  So I test drove the Viper with him in it and then
took him for a ride in my turbo.  HE COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW FAST
MY CAR WAS AND HOW EASILY AND QUIETLY IT DID ALL OF THIS!

Later

Buddy
