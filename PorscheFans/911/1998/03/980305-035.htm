I'm very happy with the Ungo I had installed in my '88 that I bought last
May. Works very well, does not false, easy to use. I especially like the
fact that it locks/unlocks the doors for me.

Okay, just purchased a 1988 Carrera Targa last night, 23,000 miles, it's a
peach. But, it's my daily driver and the car does not have a factory (or
any other) alarm.

The car is mint but it isn't exactly original (better stereo and AC updated
to the new refrigerant), so I won't feel sacreligious putting an
aftermarket alarm in it. Is that a better choice than having the dealer put
a factory alarm in, and, more importantly, is it cheaper (just bought a
Valentine One to go with her :-)

And - the first foible has presented it self; driving away from the sale,
speedo was dead, around 30mph, it swung into life. My older 911 did this,
but I can't remember the fix (bad sender?).
