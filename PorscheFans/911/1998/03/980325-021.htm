P-Fans,

My car leaks like Niagara in the spring.  The water comes in from the
head wall behind the dash on the passengers side and I am unable to
trace the location of the head waters of this deluge. I believe that it
is because my sunroof does not close all the way on the passenger side.
I removed the entire headliner last night (I needed a new one) and can
see the whole roof, but can not see how to adjust the sunroof.
Basically, the drivers side fits snugly against the front edge and
matches the roof line.  The passenger side is about 1/8-3/16" off the
front edge and lower ten the roof line.  It seems to me that the sunroof
is a little misaligned and if I could only shorten the drivers side
cable all would be well.  Haynes was useless.  I have yet to search
through my factory manuals for anything.  The actual seal looks to be in
good repair so if I could but close the roof totally I think I could be
dry!

Your advice is appreciated!
-Michael
