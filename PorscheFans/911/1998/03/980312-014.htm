I use the Performance Friction 80s on my 81 911SC.  Great on the track
and I've only had an occasional squeak on the street, usually when
cold.  The bad thing about them for the street is they don't have the
same braking characteristics when cold and warm.  If you've been driving
for a while without using your brakes, say on the highway, and you have
to make a sudden stop, you have to push harder than normal to stop the
car.  This can cause more panic than I would like in a panic stop.  In
traffic, they are great.
