Michael,
  It's lots of fun. It requires a few tools
you aren't likely to have so you better have
a good relationship with a Porsche mechanic.
Send me your email address and I can give you
a list of the tools and a place to get the
parts inexpensively. Actually, "inexpensive" is
the wrong word but you get my drift.

P.S. Repeat after me: "I will always include my email
    address if I want a reply" <g>
