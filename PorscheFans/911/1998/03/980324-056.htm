Todd Sokolowski asked about attending the Le Mans race.

I have been to  three of them; once on my own with a four day old SC and
twice as part of a group with entry to the Porsche VIP tent. My last visit was
in 87.  There are many things to say so I hardly know where to begin. First,
if possible, be there on Wednesday for the scrutineering in the town
center—not at the track,  where all the teams pose for pictures, etc. 

Next, I was able to drive much of the track on Thursday and Friday morning
before it is closed off for practice in the afternoon and night.  You just
drive on the road that is the back straight and then follow the course until
it leaves  public roads and turn toward the pits. When I stopped for lunch at
the famous cafe on the straight, there were some big names at tables around us.

I would also check out the Germany PCA Region web site since they make it an
annual big event and camp together.

If you have some specific questions, I will be happy to respond further.
