I looked at an 81 SC today and have a bunch of questions that I think could
be best answered by someone on the list.

1.  The dealer claims that the car was imported "a european model" what are
the pros/cons of the euro model.  The car doesn't have any AC or power
steering which helps to keep in light and simple i guess.  Is engine size
and power the same on the euro model.  How can I tell for certain that it
is a euro model.  VIN# WP0ZZZ91ZBS103057

2.  The car has 138,000 miles on it, how long can these engine/trans go
before major overhaul, and how much will it cost for a rebuild.  

3.  Is this a good year to start working with, are there any major reasons
not to purchase an '81 euro sc.  Other than an old engine/trans the car is
perfect, and looks better that several I've seen that were much newer.

4.  The car didn't seem that fast, could the low octane "regular" fuel that
was put in the car make a big difference in performance.  

5.  Is $14,000 a fair price, given high miles but great condition.

PLEASE cc:stewartm@cyberis.net

Any response would be greatly appreciated..
