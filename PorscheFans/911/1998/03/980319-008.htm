Hi Tory,

I have a '82 SC with a short shift kit and getting into third, even
after a complete rebuild, sux.  If my revs are under 4k usually no
worries, but above sometimes it grinds and then pops the stick out.
This usually always happens under hard accel.  All I have to say is
Porsche 915 trannys are really disappointing.  One would think that a
race bred car would be able to shift quickly and accurately because all
things being equal, he who shifts fastest wins.

Perhaps Tory and I just do not know how to shift or both our trannies
have the same problem.  If anyone wants to give a detailed blow by blow
description of their shifting style (though I am not so sure how
different it could be) maybe it will point to an error of mine.

have a nice day!

-Michael
