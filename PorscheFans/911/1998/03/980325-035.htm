I wrote in a few weeks ago about the high idle in my 83 SC.  After I 
have spent some more time with it (it's getting warmer in Colorado 
and I'm more motivated to get it running right), I have more 
questions for you guys.

I adjusted the idle down with the idle screw.  Once down to around 
1000 RPM (down from 1600), the idle oscillates from 500 to 1200, 
taking about 2 seconds for the full cycle.  Sometimes it stalls at 
the bottom revs.

There is a definate metallic rubbing sound at the high revs of the 
cycle (what I described earlier as a lawnmower-like sound).  This 
fades out as it revs above 2000.  It's also periodic, even when the 
rev stays constant around 1000 - 1600.  It seems to be comming from 
behind the fan housing.  The car has had the tensioners replaced with 
the oil-fed ones and I have seen no evidence of oil leakage.

Juergen Jagst suggested that it may be the vacuum valve switch, but I 
cannot find this.  Jim Williams suggested that the 83's don't have 
this anyway.

My two leading suspects at this time are 1) valves need adjusting or 
2) the tensioners have collapsed.  Has anyone heard of the new 
tensioners failing ?  I have no idea what either of the above two 
things sound like in person.  I only have written descriptions from 
this list to go on. Could this be it ?  Any other ideas of what this 
could be ?

I have an appointment at a local wrench in Boulder called Modern 
Specialists for next Wednesday, so I have time to tinker if anyone 
has any other ideas.

Thanks.
