Jeremy, I am the second owner of a 1980 911SC Targa with 214,000 miles
on it. I just checked my records and in the last 62,532 miles (4+
years), I spent  $10,631.38  on the following:
    4-wheel alignment
    Oil Change (Redline synthetic); replace turn signal switch; repair
fog lights; replace window stop; change gear oil
    R&R transmission (1st & 2nd syncro's); reseal crank pully seal
    Front Brakes, change trans oil
    Full service tune-up; replace cap & rotor; oil change
    Fix AC leak, recharge
    Oil/filter;"S" oil hose; fix right mirror
    Replace front condenser fan, ac fuse block
    Rear Brakes, fixed running lights
    Just Dings Dent Removal (Don't park near a 8 year old learning to
pitch <g>)
    reduced height 1" (European specs); wheel alignment; new tires
(205/55; 225/50-16VR X-GT Michelins)
    Full service tune-up; oil change; new hoses; Ox sensor; replace
washer system
    adjusted fuel pump; replaced brake fluid
    Refurbish leather seats (including re-dye)
    replace horn contact
    complete detailing
    Oil/filter;"oil line; adj right window
    replaced fuel pump
    Repair odometer + 170 mph dial face
    Full service tune-up; oil change; CV joints; brake and transmission

    fix running/fog light switch
    recharge A/C (2 lbs. R-12 Freon)
    Oil/filter (Castrol Syntec 5/50)
    replace Python horn with Clifford
    Repair Lambda wiring at fuse panel
    2 Dunlop D40 M2 tires (225/50ZR16); front end alignment
    replace lambda computer (1 yr. warranty)
    replace spark plug wires, New Distributor
    Replaced Starter (rebuilt Bosch)

This works out to ~$160/month or 16 cents/mile. Of course there are
other costs, 930 steering wheel, insurance, gas, Dinner for your wife
when she says you're spending too much time washing that darn car, ....

What you must do is to be ABSOLUTELY sure that you get a prepurchase
evaluation of whatever you buy. Ask the list for a mechanic
recommendation in your area (if you're in San Diego, e-mail me back and
I'll give you some names).

I couldn't be happier with my decision to buy a 911 (yes I could, but it
requires $65,000+ to get a new 911 <g>). Best of luck.
