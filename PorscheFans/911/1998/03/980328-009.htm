Ross,

I have not reached beyond the one hundred millionth of a parsec in my
'82 SC.  However, the engine has never been out and it is still
running on the original clutch.  The odometer is now at 223,667 and
still going.  How about those high mileage SC's?

Denny,

I took a picture as my odometer turned 200,000, I was in second gear
at 55 mph.
