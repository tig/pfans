so my beautiful new car turns out to have a rotten tranny.  sigh.

i'd found out that the thing was going to need a rebuild when i took
it in to have a shifting problem fixed (a simple loose part)--and we
found that the 1st gear slider was broken.  to make a long story
short, a loose nut (we knew it was in there, but where...) lodged in
between the shift fork and the case, and stuck the thing in reverse at
the autocross this weekend.  this seemed like a sign from above that
it was time to rebuild.

after work today i stopped by my mechanic's to see what was to be
seen: 5th gear needle bearing is shot, 2nd gear dog teeth are munged,
couple synchros gone, the intermediate plate thingies need to be
replaced and (aarrgh), the pinion is hosed.  mechanic tells me it's
probably cheaper to get a whole new tranny.  oh yeah, and i need a
clutch, and maybe a pressure plate and flywheel (both are in that grey
area).

so now i've got a host of questions.  as background, the car is a '73
with a 2.4 E/S motor (~180 hp), running 245/50-15 R1s in back; big
torsion bars, big sway bars, big flares--your basic autox weapon.  the
tranny is stock, with a 7:31 R/P and 240K miles on it.  my plan/dream
is to put a big motor (3.2 or 3.6) in it in a few years, but that's
kinda hazy--and realistically, i might want a new tranny to go along
with the engine anyways.  i'm definitely going to autox the daylights
out of the car; i will probably do a fair amount of time-trialing
(driver's ed); it's also a street car (heck, it's my only car).  i'm
running on a reasonably tight budget, especially since i just bought
the car...

the questions:

* do i want a limited slip?  badly enough to pay the hefty premium?
given that said premium would push the big motor even further into the
future?  if so, clutch-type, or quaife?  

* what are the disadvantages of a 7:31 R/P?  my mechanic (a very
conservative guy) seems to think it will be problematic.

* how ugly a hassle is it to switch to an electronic speedo?  how much
will it cost?

* what year/model trannys are good, which should i stay away from?
'72's with the bass-ackwards mainshaft seals i know about; does anyone
know the serial number range for these?

* any problems buying a later tranny with a 7:31 in it?

* what/who is a good source for rebuilt transmissions?  anyone have a
tranny they'd like to sell, and some good assurances that it's worth
buying?

* what other advice can you give me on this ugly situation?

thanks,
