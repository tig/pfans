Greg:

It's not the solenoid.  The solenoid is part of the starter; it
forces the starter gear into the flywheel ring gear so the engine can
be turned over... If your engine cranked when you turned the key,
the solenoid is working fine.

From your description, I can't tell what the missing "electric 
power-on kind of noise" was... If you're talking about a 
high-pitched whine, it's the CD (capacitive-discharge ignition) 
box; if you're talking about a ticking noise, it's the fuel pump.

Either way, I suspect that some water from the rainstorm got into 
your electrics and shorted out some connections... Now that the 
engine has dried off, the problem's fixed.

To avoid the problem in the future, you can either poke around in the 
engine compartment looking for ways to waterproof all your electrical 
connections... Or you can just not park the car outside in heavy 
rains.
