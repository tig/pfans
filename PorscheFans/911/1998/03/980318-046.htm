Hey all.  After asking about the door buzzer a few weeks ago I finally had
some time today to actually look for it.  Someone had mentioned that it was
behind the fuel gauge.  I found it today...there were 3 relays, the buzzer was
the center relay.  I removed it and confirmed it was the buzzer.  Now my
question is, what else does this relay do?  Does it only operate the buzzer?

Also, I will be in Carlsbad, Cal. this weekend (20th thru 23rd) and was
wondering if there were any Porsche related events happenning.

Thanks!
