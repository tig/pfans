Bob:

I don't fault your conclusion, but your reasoning may be a little 
faulty.

It's easy to come up with  a thought experiment that disproves your
first notion:  Let's say, for purposes of argument, that the engine
flows more air with no filter than with the factory filter, and that
the "dirt" we're filtering is ferrous dust... Very fine iron filings
or something.  

With the factory paper element in place, some large percentage of 
this iron dust is filtered at the expense of airflow.

Now pull the factory paper element out and replace it with a
"filter" that's just an open hole with a strong magnet at the side. 
Since there's no obstruction in the manifold, this "filter" flows 
more air, yet it DOESN'T filter less dust than the paper element.

If the idea of magnetic dirt seems too far removed from reality to 
make a convincing analogy, imagine an intake manifold that forces 
the incoming air to turn a sharp corner.  Flypaper (or an oil bath) 
on the outside of that corner will trap all the dirt that's flung to 
the outside by centrifugal force.  Again, this can be accomplished 
without blocking the intake with ANYTHING, so it can allow more 
flow than a paper element while still filtering just as well.

Your second point -- that if two filters trap just as much dirt, 
"nothing changes" -- can also be disproven.

Imagine a filter that REALLY disrupts the airflow... Maybe a 
high-speed fan in the intake tract whose blades are covered with 
something sticky.  This "filter" might trap dirt just as well as the 
factory element or the K&N filter, but all the turbulence it 
generates will do nothing good for the engine's power.

Admittedly, none of these examples (with the exception of the oil
bath) ever actually appear in the real world, but I think they
illustrate that airflow and filtering capacity aren't always
inversely proportional.

Personally, I use the factory element in my NSX and a pair of K&N 
filters in my 914-6.  Oil analysis performed on the 914 has NOT shown 
any increased levels of silica or accelerated wear.
