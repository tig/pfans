Hello all!  I'm in the process of replacing the plastic pedal bushings =
with the bronze ones.  I found a couple of pretty serious problems with =
the shaft that the clutch pedal mounts on.

First off, I was unable to get the clutch cable clevis pin off with the =
assembly in the car.  So I removed the pedal assembly and after cutting =
the clevis and pressing the pin out, I found that the plastic bushing =
was gone!  And, the clevis pin was almost worn right through the area =
where the bushing should have been!

Then, after removing the clutch pedal and disassembling the brake pedal =
stuff, I noticed that the arm is cracked right through on one side where =
the roll pin goes through the clutch pedal & shaft assembly.  I'll =
admit, I had to use quite a bit of force to get that pin out.

I guess my question is, where do I get a new shaft for my clutch pedal?  =
Is that was this part is called?  There is no part number on it.  It =
took some doing to get this assembly out of the car, and I don't want to =
have to do it again.  So I'd really like to replace this part.

For anybody who has a car with some miles on it (mine has 151k) and has =
never done the bushing job, I would say it's worth it.  I've found a =
number of problems while doing this job.
