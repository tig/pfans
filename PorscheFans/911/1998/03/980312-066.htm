Hi Fans,

I am considering replacing the ol' battery with an Optima as the Interstate
is on its last leg. I recall some talk not too long ago about a plate you
can get from AJUSA that bolts to the bottom of the battery and it will hook
right up with factory mounts. Anyone had experience with this? Also do
cables have to be changed? I checked out the Optima web site and it sounds
like the ultimate battery although expensive. What model should I get? Any
personal experiences would be most helpful.

Also, has anyone had any experience with the "scratch cream" you see on TV?
You know, you rub it on the scratch and it disappears. It seems that some
@#$hole drug a package or something across my rear fender and left a
scratch that I can't polish out I don't believe. It seems that this would
be the answer if it would work. I am rather sceptical though. I figure it
has some mega filler that will fill the scratch and make it seem to
disappear. Just thought I would ask.
