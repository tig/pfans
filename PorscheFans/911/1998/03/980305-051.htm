For Bob T. and Dave;

There is an article in Up-fixin, Volume 4, page 25, about how to build
your own sport muffler from a pre-74 muffler. From experience, this
applies to the 74 muffler as well.

We have done several of these since the article first appeared in
October of 1974.

This works quite well, however it is kinda noisy. I might suggest
keeping the pipes as close as possible to the mounting strap location to
help keep this unit quieter. There are also some tips that have
perforated ID's that may help in the noise department  :^)

I do not know how well this would work on the OEM mufflers found on the
SC or Carrera 3.2, however.
