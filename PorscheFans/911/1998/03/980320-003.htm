Greetings,

I've seen a few posts lately regarding flat spots in the 3k-4k RPM range. I
also recall seeing a check list of sorts posted sometime last summer that
listed, in order of probability, the things to check in order to resolve
this problem. I was wondering if someone could repost the list or one like
it. My car is a stock 84 coupe, it idles normally (both hot and cold) and
I've done the Techron thing. Now I need help to systematically shoot this
problem. Thanks.

84 911 Coupe
===============================
This might be worth checking... Last year, while working in my the car, I
decided to lube the centrifugal advance mechanism inside the distributor on
my 84 Carrera. It rides on two plastic bushings and can be gotten to by
removing the distrib cap and rotor. Well, I decided to lube it up with some
white lithium grease. BIG MISTAKE! THe car developed a flat spot at about
3-4 k. It seems that by adding grease, I made them hang... After using
some brake cleaner and q-tips to completly flush the area, the car returned
to normal operation. If you think about it, at about 3.5K is where things
begin to happen, at least in my car. This coincides with the dist mech advance.

Might be worth to check yours out for gunk. Good luck!

Lou
