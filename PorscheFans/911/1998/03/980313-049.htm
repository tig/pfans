About a year ago, I bought a very original 1970 911T.  Leaking all
fluids/clutch gone/shocks gone/paint not so good...  The car had lived in
Pasadena it's entire life and had been maintained by the original owner. 
Unfortunately, it had never really been restored.

A year later.  I've restored just about everything, except the paint.  

Here's the problem:  The engine runs GREAT, but smokes when it's hot and
idling, and occasionally on hard acceleration, although, it does NOT smoke
immediately after running at high rpms, no matter how hot it is.  At first, I
thought the rings had not fully seated, but it is getting worse.  I burn about
2-3 quarts of oil every 1000 miles.

I had a standard top engine rebuild done a year ago (guessing 86,000, the
odometer was disconnected) and was advised not to mess with replacing or
restoring the cylinder barrels.  Is this my problem?

What's the best plan of attack? (In terms of figuring out what the problem
is).  Compression/leakdown on all cylinders?  Could it be something else, like
valve seals...?  How much of a hassle is it to do the barrels with the engine
in the car?  Is it possible?

As it stands, I'm going to have to get my mechanic to fix this, which I'm sure
he's not going to be too thrilled about.

I love my car and drive it every day.  It runs great and is always reliable. 
It's just embarrassing to sit at a stoplight and smoke out all the cars around you.

Thanks for the help.
