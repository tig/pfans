Hi P Fans,

I am in the process of installing a 930 tie rod kit on my 71 911T.  If
anyone has performed this upgrade I would love to talk to you.  I need to
know how to take the old tie rods off, specifically the end that is
connected to the steering rack.  Do I just turn the tie rod off as it
appears that's the way the new one goes on?  I received two round spacers
with my kit.  Do I use these between the tie rod and the steering rack or
are these only to be used in certain applications?  Also, on the end of the
930 tie rod that connects to the steering rack, there seems to be a ball
joint.  Should I be able to move this.  I can't, but I've noticed that one
of my tie rods is perfectly straight and the other one looks like the ball
within the joint has moved so the tie rod isn't perfectly straight.  

Thanks in advance for your help,

John
