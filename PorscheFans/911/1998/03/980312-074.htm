Hi folks:

My 88 Carrera has a speedo that is working erraticly; on a cold startup,
sometimes the speedo and odometer are completely dead; usually one good
bump in the road and it springs to life and is fine the rest of the time.
Naturally, when I had it at the dealer for a brake flush today, it behaved
normally. The service manager sez gear oil can get on the sensor and
inhibit it briefly. How tough is it for a novice (and an inept one at that,
although I did replace my dimmer switch in just THREE hours) to replace the
sender and where exactly is it hidden? Oh, and of course as soon as I
actually LEFT the dealer it didn't work again.

Also, to the individual who wants to paint his polished wheel, he can do it
himself and get a pretty decent job just by doing some careful taping of
the polished lips and getting some Wurth spray paint. It's a good idea to
coat the inside of the lug holes with Vaseline to avoid getting paint on
them. As an alternative, there is a place in Miami called Ernie's Porsche
Alloys; he had (recently) a lot of 6" and 7" x 16" Fuchs with black centers
that he said were "like new" for about $825 for the set with shipping. If
your polished Fuchs are straight and in decent shape, he'd probably give
you $100 a wheel. I did get some pre-owned wheels for my 95 BMW Cabrio from
him, and they were very nice and straight to boot. Just a satisfied
customer. YMMV.
