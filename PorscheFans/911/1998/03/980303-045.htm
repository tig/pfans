Chris-
I made a bleeder like you suggest, and used a metal fuel bottle of the
type that backpackers use to carry their stove fuel.  Sometimes you can
find them made out of stainless steel, but most often aluminum.  With the
stainless it is easier to solder fittings and a dip tube to the bottle,
but it is not impossible to do it with special solders sold for use on
aluminum. The thing works very well, just do not use much more than about
15 psi, depending upon what sort of tubing you use between the fuel bottle
and the brake fluid reservoir.
