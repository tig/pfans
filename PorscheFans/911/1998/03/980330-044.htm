Well it took two or more attempts with a 20-pound boulder before the rear
window shattered.  I woke up on Friday to a perfect Targa day, sunny and
70o.  I glanced out the window and spent 30-seconds blinking to clear my
eyes and get my brain warmed up.  Suddenly everything registered.  The
reflection inside the car was caused by the same fragmented green substance
beside the car, BROKEN GLASS!  Of all windows, why the rear targa window.

I ran outside to investigate figuring that I just bought $600+ worth of
glass and it could be fixed quickly, no such luck.  The window must have
survived the first impact leading the boulder to roll down the back of the
car where it left several small dents and numerous deep scratches in the
paint.  The low-life picked up the boulder again and threw it with enough
force to shatter the glass.  Amazingly as the boulder entered the car it
also damaged both front seats; tore the side of the driver's seat, and
split the seat cushion on the passenger's seat.  Nothing was taken and no
one attempted to enter the car, this was purely an act of vandalism.  Now
I'm shelling out $$ and will be without the car for two or more weeks.

On the positive side, depending on how you view it, I had the chance to
drive either a cabriolet or a '69 soft back targa for a day.  I sincerely
hope the low-life doesn't come by again when I get the car back.

Thanks for the shoulder,
