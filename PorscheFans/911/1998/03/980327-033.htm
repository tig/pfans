Father of German Sportscar Porsche Dies   

March 27, 1998 11:58 AM EST

VIENNA, Austria (Reuters) - Ferdinand Porsche, founder of German
sportscar maker Porsche AG, has died in the Austrian mountain resort
of Zell am See, the Austrian news agency APA said Friday.

He was 88.

It quoted the Porsche company in Salzburg, Austria, as saying he
would be buried privately in Zell am See and that an official
funeral service would take place in Stuttgart, Germany.

No further details were given.

Porsche, or Ferry as he was known, was born near the Austrian
capital of Vienna, the son of engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his wife
Aloisia on Sept. 19, 1909.

The family moved to Stuttgart where Ferry Porsche came to work in his
father's engineering company, which produced the prototype Volkswagen
in Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany in 1936.

A year earlier, Porsche married Dorothea Reitz of Stuttgart. They had
four sons.

In 1950, he started producing his first sportscar, the 356. It was
succeeded by the Porsche 911 in 1963.

Porsche, who in the 1930s acquired a vacation home in Zell am See, led
the Stuttgart company until 1972. He gave up his vote on the board in
1993.
