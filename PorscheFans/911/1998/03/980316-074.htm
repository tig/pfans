Any information on the subject is appreciated.

I am contemplating the purchase of a "long term project" 911.  The one I =
looked at from what I was told by the owner is that it is a 1972 911 S =
Targa.  The car has been sitting in a body shop for a long time, with a =
lot of its interior and exterior parts dismanteled, and "supposedly" =
none missing

I would like help on the following, please:

1) How can I determine if this really an S and not an E ?
2) How can I tell if all the numbers match ?
3) Where do I find the relevant numbers on this car (chassis, engine, =
transmission, etc.) ?
4) What is a properly restored similar car worth ?

I do know the following:

1) The engine is fuel injected.
2) The oil filler lid is located on the rear right fender
3) Upon first inspection, the only number I came up with is located on =
the fan shroud, and it is the following: 901 106 101 5R

Please do not hesitate to send any information you find relevant, no =
matter how trivial you think it is. I will be investing in this car if =
it the right one !  Thanks.

Samer Hijazi
