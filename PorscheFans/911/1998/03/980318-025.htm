Daniel,

The size of your tires are not going to make a difference on what you
read on your gauges.  If you install bigger tires, the car will be
traveling faster than your speedometer tells you but, yet if your
speedometer reads 60, the RPMs will be the same no matter what the size
of the tires are.

Your car might have been fitted with a newer transmission or newer
speedometer or newer tachometer from a different car and that might
cause the difference in RPM vs the manual.  Just my 0.02 cents.  I'm
sure you'll get much better (accurate) response from other members of
the list.
