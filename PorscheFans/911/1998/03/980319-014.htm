Ok, so that's a bad pun on a popular song....
My 911 has been playing that song every morning for a while, from behind
the pedals somewhere, and as much as I try to ignore it, it's becoming
fairly irritating to have a 99% fixed up 911 squeaking like a Yugo. I
have followed with interest the discussion on the front torsion bar
(forgot the exact vocabulary) and the the ends of it that can squeak on
the metal if the plastic is broken or whatever....

Now on to questions: Is it something I could fix myself if the extent of
my knowledge is an oil change ? (and I am not even sure where the
torsion bar is, but I have good jacks and tools and willingness...) 
Is there a place where squirting some oil would  make it shut up for a
while and at least prove that's where the problem is ?
If not, how much should an honest mechanic charge me worst case ? And is
there more to this?  I mean, if you remove and reinstall the torsion
bar, shouldn't you check ride height again or alignment etc..... 

As usual, many thanks, owning a 911 on my budget would not be feasible
without your help !
