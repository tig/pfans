I own a 1982 911 SC coupe. When I bought the car we found during inspection
went hard to the right when in a panic stop.

The car had not been driven for long periods before I bought it. My mechanic
thought the right front caliper was frozen and needed replacment.

We replaced the right and left front calipers and noticed an immediate
improvement. But still in a panic stop situation the brakes lock up but not a
seemingly equal times.

We then replaced all the rotors and brake pads. When that didn't work, we
replaced the master cylinder and put in steel brake lines....Finally we
replaced the tires yesterday.. That helped some but it's still there.

The car stops perfectly straight and the brakes feel excellant. But in a panic
stop the car brakes unpredicatably.

I'm having the alignment done next week but we doubt that is the problem since
the old tires were wearing perfectly <equally> and the car go perfectly
straight when braking, until the brakes lock up.....

The steering wheel tends to go to the right in the panic stop situation.

I have spent a lot of money throwing parts at the problem....This is the 2nd
mechanic to try to solve the problem...

Any leads or help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark
