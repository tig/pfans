Gary, for what it's worth, I had an '84 Carrera that continually passed a
standing idle emission test without a cat; this was in Western PA up until 
I got rid of it in ''96 with 135,000 miles.  Car barely recorded anything on
HC, CO, and CO2.  I don't know how this would translate into a dynamometer-
type test which I understand NJ now has, but generally the 3.0 and 3.2 engines
are pretty rugged from what I have heard.  Biggest problem would be valve
guides starting to go at about this mileage (mine were approaching
wear limits when I sold car, but bottom end was like new).

If he has latest sticker, do they write the mileage on the sticker?  If it's
less
than 12,000 mi sine car was inspected,  you are probably OK for 1-3 years, or
more, is my guess.  Then again, if state also does a visual check, you're
dead meat.

Hi Pfans,

I looked at an '81 SC last weekend that seems to have been very well
maintained in every respect.  Mileage is 80k.  The car has received
a number of recent performance upgrades including an SSI ('74) heat
exchanger and an Ansa dual inlet/single outlet muffler.  According to
the owner, in order to accommodate this system, the catalytic
converter had to be removed.

The owner claims the car passes emissions without the cat.  I didn't
see anything that made me doubt his claim.  The original exhaust
system with cat comes with the car.

Up until what mileage can I reasonably expect the car to pass
emission without a cat?  I'm concerned that around 100-140k miles the
engine will become worn to the point that the car will fail emissions
and then I'll have to switch back to the original, more restrictive
exhaust system or will be forced to opt for a more expensive solution.
Is this a legitimate concern?  Is there a system available that utilizes
the cat but flows as freely as this "hi-po" system?

I realize there's no free lunch when owning a 17 year old 911, but
I'm just trying to determine whether I'm going to be in for a very
high dollar repair in the next few years.

Thanks,

Gary
