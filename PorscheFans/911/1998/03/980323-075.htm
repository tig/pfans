Chip,

Thanks for the info.  I looked precisely for a C4 because all the magazines
talked about how the oversteer problem of the 911s was fixed in this model.
Some also mentioned that you really had to do something foolish to get this
car to go out of control.  I really like the AWD in the rain and snow but,
it doesn't compare to the handling of my friends AWD Typhoon or Eagle Talon
or A4 Quattro.

Again, it is somewhat disappointing and I might look into softening the ride
a little since there is little benefit from the hard riding C4 here in
Chicago.

Luis
