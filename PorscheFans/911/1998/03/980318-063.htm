All right, I took my car for a spin today, only like the 3rd one
:) I like it... Okay I love it!!

But, I'm used to my shifter in my AWD eclipse and it's totally
different (DOH). When I shift fast it almost seems I'm pulling the
car out of gear before the clutch goes in, possible but doubt it.
Is there some delay, fix, worn bushings? Also going into 3rd
quickly is not a fun thing to do, I end up trying, failing, then
putting it back into 2nd then slowly throwing it into 3rd and it
goes in with no problem.

I know we had some bushing replacement FAQS for the DSM's I wonder
if there are some papers out there with some shifter, tranny,
linkage, short shifter tricks for the Pcar, 911.

Also what do you all do about that big shifter in the middle of
your floor? Sorry to say this but a friend said it and I'm just
repeating it "Tory, you have to do something about that big ford
truck looking shifter in your car". I know the new ones have
center consoles and if the console didn't weigh much I would be
interested in one.

I know I know, it's a sports car, but the way the interior looks
and feels is important to me!

Thanks for all your kind help answering all of my other questions.
I really appreciate it and again, I really like the feel of this
list.

Thanks,
