Jad, if I used the plug tool in the kit, it would not do me any good, as it
is non-existent (would like to hear from some other 993 owners on this).
I guess Porsche figured only 0.0001% of all owners would ever change their
own plugs, so they dropped it.

I intend to look into the 964 tool; I just figured they didn't include it in
all
of the cars starting with the 3.6 litre engines.

Good luck!

<< THANKS FOR THE RESPONSE.  Mine is going to the dealer for the bottom six
 plug. Think I will have them adjust the valves as well. One question
 though, I used the sparkplug wrench in the tool kit which seemed to work
 amazingly well instead of the misc tools you used.  The sparkplug tool has
 a good piece of rubber that grips the plugs so they don't fall out and has
 a universal joint to get into the weird places and of course is the perfect
 length.  Is there a reason this did not work for you?  One advantage to the
 964 appears to be the plug hidden under the PS pump can be reached from
 above with a triple jointed arm or a few cuts and some patients.
 
 Thanks again.
