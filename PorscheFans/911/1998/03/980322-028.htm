964 Distributor Belt Replacement.

I posted a few days ago a "need help" message on replacing the belt =
inside the distributor of my C4. With the exception of one, all of the =
replies I received where asking me to write something about this task =
when I finish the job on my car.

Although English is not my first language, I=92ll do my best. I =
apologize if the following info upsets anyone who makes a living off of =
doing this type of work but I know I could have used this info a couple =
of days ago.

I am not responsible for any damage that anyone could cause to their =
engine following my recommendations or miss-information that I could =
accidentally provide here.

This is not easy work and you shouldn=92t even start if you are not =
serious about finishing.

I=92ll start by saying that if I could reverse time, I would have sent =
my distributor out to one of the shops that offer to do the job for $150 =
with 24 hr turn around. Although, If I had to do it again, I could =
provably do the job in just over a couple of hours.

Besides the obvious tools, you might need the following:

-Dremel

-Drill

-Very long C-Clamp (about 12 inch opening)

-Lock washer removal tool



#1-Remove the distributor caps. (note their position)

To do this, you will need to remove the left heater duct, and all the =
spark plug wires. Make sure to plug the huge opening left by the heater =
duct so that you don=92t accidentally drop a screwdriver into the heat =
exchanger. Note the positions of each spark plug cable if they are not =
labeled.

#2-Mark the position of the rotors in the distributor body. It will be =
difficult to mark the exact position but for now, an approximate should =
be good enough.

#3-Remove the distributor from the car.

The whole distributor is held down by only one screw that sits next to =
the base. It might, however, be difficult to pull it out because of the =
vacuum that is created as you pull out. Be careful not to rotate it so =
that you can mark the position of the gear at the bottom of the shaft. =
Mark the position of this gear in reference to the dist body and in =
reference to the shaft to which is mounted.

#4-Remove the rotors and on the main dist remove the clip that holds the =
big plug, pull the big plug out and a smaller plug should come out from =
inside it.

#5-Remove the three Phillips screws inside the main distributor and push =
the plug inside the distributor so that the guts can rotate.

#6-Using the correct hex tool, remove 5 hex screws from the distributor =
(one from between the two distributors and 2 from inside each =
distributor.

#7-Remove the pin holding the gear at the end of the shaft Do not waste =
your time (like I did) trying to save the pin to reuse it. Just drill =
trough it. You can buy the pin at Pep Boys or other auto-parts store for =
under a dollar. The pin is set in an unusual way; you will need to drill =
pretty deep into it before it can be force out. Be careful, both shafts =
are held in under pressure and as soon as the pin comes out, parts fly =
through your garage or basement.

#8-Using the Dremel, file down the three indents holding the cap at the =
bottom of the second distributor shaft. Take the cap out carefully. You =
will be reusing that same cap.

#9-Take out the lock washer at the bottom of the shaft of the second =
distributor. Again, kept under pressure. Things will fly.

#10-If it hasn=92t already come out, you can now take out the housing =
around the belt.

#11-Clean the mess that the old belt made around the housing and =
distributors.

#12-Replace the belt by putting it around the primary distributor (the =
one with longer shaft) first, turn it to the previously marked position =
on the distributor body (the rotor position), place the belt around the =
second distributor. Again, you can put back the rotor and make sure it =
points towards the previously marked position on the dist body. Slide =
the smaller shaft into its housing. You=92ll have to try this a few =
times. It helps if you are on the phone with your mother.

I lubricated everything around the shafts before putting it back =
together.

Make sure that both rotors are pointing towards the previously marked =
points on the body. Don=92t be an extremist on these positions. The =
teeth on the belt will make it be right on the money or noticeably off =
the mark.

#13-Insert the gear at the bottom of the long shaft. Using C-Clamps or =
other means of applying pressure, compress the long shaft of the =
distributor against the gear itself. Compress it far enough so that you =
are able to re-insert the new pin.

#14-Compress the small shaft against the body of the distributor (note =
that is different from #13) and insert the lock washer once it is =
compressed far in enough.

It helps to use a semi hard piece of wood on the top of the shafts so =
that the C-Clamp doesn=92t mark or damage the top of the shafts.

--Continue putting everything back together.

#16-Install distributor back in the car. Note that as is goes in the =
rotors rotate. You will need to off set the rotors so that as they =
rotate when inserting, they end up pointing towards the right place =
(same place that they were pointing before initial removal) Again, if is =
in the wrong position it will be very noticeable.

If any one has questions, feel free to e-mail me:
