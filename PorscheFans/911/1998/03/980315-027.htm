Thank you to everyone who responded to my inquiry about oil analysis
results.

To answer Ed's question about mileage on the oil:

The this oil was less than 1000 miles old, most of which was wide-open on
the track in extreme conditions (100+ degrees in Vegas)  and a few
autocrosses.

It appears that this outfit is somewhat less rigorous in their analysis as
labs others
have used.  I seem to remember someone on the list awhile ago mentioning a
company
called Titan labs in Colorado that did a good job, but I didn't save the
message.

FWIW:
In this case, I was placing an order with Pegasus and noticed this package
they sell now.
It costs $20 and consists of a plastic vial and cardboard shipping cylinder
with a pre-paid
postage sticker.

Thanks again,
Drew Spencer
