Don't need a dyno at all, just a lonely stretch of back road and a good 
stopwatch
   -  Drive car in third at about 2000 RPM
   -  Floor accelerator at chosen landmark
   -  Start stopwatch when tach hits 3000 RPM
   -  Stop stopwatch when tach hits 6000 RPM
   -  Return to start, repeat 2-3 more times to eliminate errors

This should be approx. 9-10 second window,enough to evaluate any 
changes.  I used this when evaluating several chips iin my old ''84
Turbo-Look (switched between OE and purchased one).  Eventually 
kept original; all the aftermarket ones did
not improve times in above range, and some were worse.

Second option is a G-analyst, but to me have to drive consistently over
same stratch of road to get meaningful results.

My "seat-of-the-pants" impression is that the Weltmeister chip has an
edge over the one from AutoThority (hence why I'm keeping the
Weltmeister).  The difference seems very slight, though.

I'd really like to dynotest the two chips, for curiosity's sake.  Has
anyone done this or know of results?
