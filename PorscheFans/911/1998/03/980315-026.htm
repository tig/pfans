My 88 Targa seems to lock up the driver's side rear tire on hard braking
(i.e., the tire chirps). When I had the car checked before purchase last
week, my mechanic said the only thing he could find wrong was a sticking
caliper ... probably from a lack of use (car had been driven 3,000 miles in
the last 5 years, and has 23,000 miles total). He recommended a brake flush
as a possible solution, which I just had done, but today I noticed the
chirping thing (this was not a panic stop, just a straight line hit the
brakes hard for the helluvit thing).

Would a stuck caliper exhibit this symptom? Will use eventually work it
free, or should it be rebuilt?

Also, anyone know what a fair price for a complete tool kit would be? Not
concours, or anything, just all there. Also wondering what a Blaupunkt Reno
cassette player might go for - that's what was originally on the car.

Thanks, Vic
