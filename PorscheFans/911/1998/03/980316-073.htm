Chet -

I replaced the master cylinder on my '87 last summer.  By my estimation 
you're right - after removing lots of ductwork it was pretty straightforward.
You're also right that the clearance is very tight without removing the power
booster.  I tried, and ended up having to remove the booster because I 
couldn't slide the MC rearward enough to clear the mounting studs.  The
job would have been quicker had I removed the booster first.

To remove the booster, you disconnect the pedal linkage, then remove the
large diameter pivot shaft that goes through the booster support in the trunk.
As I recall it then unbolts by the four nuts that hold the support to the
floor
of the trunk.  The procedure wasn't difficult.

Two things to keep in mind - brake fluid is very hard on paint, so don't spill
any!  And check inside your booster for leaked brake fluid.  After finishing 
mine, I discovered a suspicious gurgle noise that I haven't the heart to 
go after (anyone know an easy way to drain the booster!)

Yes, the lower mounting bolt is very easy to reach from the footwell.  The 
toughest part was the ductwork.

There have been many threads on brake bleeding.  I had lots of frustration 
with mine until I tried the pressurized fluid resevoir method.  I found you
only
need about 10 psi.  If you use the traditional method, several folks recommend
shortening the pedal stroke to avoid running the pistons abnormally deep 
into the cylinder and damaging the seals.  A block of wood under the pedal...

Cheers,
