Luis:

No problem with the posts. That's why we're here. =


=46rom what I've read, "they all do that" applies here. Physics gets in
the way when the front tires are trying to pull the car and turn it at
the same time. Grip used for pulling must be subtracted from cornering
grip, hence the understeer. Any four-wheel drive car will naturally
understeer more than it's two-wheel drive counterpart, so the BMW will
always have an edge here. However, the 911 is a car that physics says is
not supposed to handle even in two-wheel drive. So forget physics:-).
Excellence carried a series a few years ago about making the C4 handle.
It involved changing springs and sway bars, I think(e-mail me if you
need the exact dates). =

As for the potholes in Chicago, the cheapest fix is to buy a new Mayor.
