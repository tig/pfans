I don't think this made it the first time, so I'm sending again.  Apologies
for any duplication.

Just thought I'd share a good experience.  As some of you know, I've sold
my 911 (waahhh!) but the mechanic I've been taking it to is absolutely
first-rate.  I've only been dealing with him for the last few months, but
everything has been great.  He's done excellent work at a fair price and
he's a straight-shooter who's been very sensitive to my limited budget.  To
be honest, I don't think I could have sold the car without him.  He talked
to my buyer several times as a favor to me and made sure the guy felt good
about the car (it really IS a great car).

You could eat off the floor in his shop and his equipment is a garage
dream, with four bays and a scrupulously clean service area.  Incidentally,
he also races and managed to finish 10th overall at the Daytona 24hrs in a
GT3 car!  I got to crawl all over that car, which is being rebuilt.

A good guy who does excellent work at a fair price, with honesty in
everything he does.  I'm not affiliated at all, just *very* happy with his
work.
