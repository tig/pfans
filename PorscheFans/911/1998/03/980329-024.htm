My 71' 911T Targa with a 73 ? CIS engine will not start after coming =
down off of the blocks from winter storage. The car was stored in =
October after completely replacing the entire fuel system after a fire =
and I just took it down this Friday. Putting in the freshly charged =
battery (stored inside away from the concrete floor all winter) it =
cranks but won't fire. I can hear a high pitched whiring sound when I =
turn the ignition on. The sound is much higher pitch than normal I =
think, but then again it usually fires right away and the exhaust masks =
the sound. I think the noise must be the fual pump kicking in ? I do =
smell gas but it will not fire, or even sputter. Could the points be =
closed down ? What else should I look for before I pay the towing =
company to bring it into the wrench ?

Also, just finding the trunk/boot light in my car I find the previous =
owner disconnected it. Re-connecting it I find that the switch does not =
work, the light is on all the time. Any hints on this switch. Looks =
painful to remove, I don't have to remove the trunk lid do I ?
