I've only seen spypics of the cab, but I finally saw my first 996 in the
flesh
at the local dealer and was underwhelmed to say the least.  It was sitting
next to a new 993 and what kept hitting me was "man, it's got a bigger
butt than me!"  That rear end is sooo high, but aerodynamic I guess.
I thought the cab (spypics at least) *really* looked like a Boxster.  I
guess I'll have to see one up close to form a real opinion, though. :)

Not that I would turn one down....

79SC Coupe, gone and sorely missed
