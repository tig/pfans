David,

I can tell you where I've recently gotten/ordered various interior parts
for my '77 911S.  If you're in a hurry the larger vendors will likely
have these pieces readily available.  If you're willing to wait and hunt
a bit, private individuals advertising here, or in Panorama and
Excellence magazines, are probably a less expensive option, but may not
allow returns and require cash payment.

Panels/Pocket covers/Pockets/Handles:
Bought used from a guy in Rhode Island who had an ad in Panorama (Feb
'98). All in leather.  Panels include Alpine separates speakers.  For
$300, I figure if even the majority of this stuff is to my standards,
its a buy!  Due in end of week.

Fiberglass pockets:
Pair of new fiberglass pockets ($125/pr) from Original Fit Interiors in
Oregon (541.679.4460, ask for John).  Have mats (Black with grey Porsche
lettering) on order from them ($95; they will also do trimming in custom
colors and materials).

Rear seats:
From Einmalig in California (714.895.6567).  Rear jump seats and pads in
leather, $350 (may be slightly more for newer cars due to different
design).  Also getting a vinyl dash from them.  Due in tomorrow.

Other sources:
This list!
PartsHeaven (800.767.7250)
Motor Sports Road and Racing (213.660.7180)

Or consider recovering versus replacement:
Original Fit Interiors (541.679.4460)
Autos International (619.481.1603)
World Upholstery and Trim (800.222.9577)
Classic German Interiors (610.534.7535)

If ordering parts rather than covers, get pictures!  Also ask about
discounts for cash/credit card surcharges.  Good luck.
