Paul - what I read says that the alternator light isn't only a warning, it also
serves as a source of current to excite the diodes to get the alternator to
start working.  I don't understand  why diodes, which I think of
simplistically as one way valves, need excitement, but that's what one
reads.  Maybe a little current is needed to put some electromagnetism into
the alternator.  This comes into play if the bulb burns out or is left out or
disconnected.  No excitement, no alternator output.

But did the red light come on when you turned on the key?  If it did, that
shows that the bulb is OK, and also that the wiring from the bulb back to
the regulator and alternator is also OK, and you have some other
problem.

When the battery voltage (which is the same as the B+ voltage) equals
the D+ voltage, no current can flow through the light, and it won't shine. 
If D+ is 0, and battery is 12.4, current flows (somehow it can get to
ground via the D+) and light lights up.  When alternator kicks in, D+ comes
up, and "battery" voltage also comes up, and light goes out.


I once replaced the internal regulator, and within a month it failed. 
Mechanic I bought it from said the new one was defective (I had him do
the second replacement in case I had messed things up, although in fact I
hadn't) and put in another, which has worked fine ever since.  So things
like that can, alas, happen.

Now you know what little I know, and probably too late, as I hope you
have it already figured out - took me a while to get around to reading the
list (and it looks like there is no March 10 list?  Archive said wasn't one). 
Perhaps you could let us all know what the problem was.
