Yeah - it was a lot of fun to see!  I was disappointed that the Porsche GT1
didn't win it's class though - but I never did quite catch what their 5-minute
penalty was for.  Anybody know the details?

On another racing note:  I know ESPN isn't going to carry Formula 1 this
season, but is there anyway that we can get any coverage without buying a
satellite?
