I have several things I would like to ask you about the 1982 911 I bought
in Nov.

1. The Headlight washers don't work. The fuse is fine and the relay clicks
when the lights are on - but no water.  Anything?

2. The cruise control does not come on.  I was wondering if there were
relays, switches, etc other than the control unit up front that can cause
failure.  Perhaps the brake and clutch switches are bad???

3. The car's left front brake moans (not squeel) when I am barely moving
(2-10 MPH) is this a sticking caliper?  I can also feel the vibration of
the moan through the steering column.

4. Are there lights that come on at the vent controls? right now it is
always dark. 

5. I would like to lower the car so that the tires are almost flush with
the fenders.  Is this an easy task on a 911?  It would seem to me that all
one has to do is change the alignment of the torsion bar... anything I
should know (the car has bilstiens)

6. What is the fan that is in front of the spare tire and next to the
battery in the very front of the car.  It doesn't seem to work.

Thanks to everyone in advance.
