> Joe's question raises one from me.  If there are different size

> was a bit disappointed when told that my marine battery box mount
> wouldn't pass NER PCA tech inspection for DE.  Seems they (NER) want
> the battery to be hard mounted to the car.  In a box thats mounted to
> the car won't pass.  That leaves me either fabricating some kind of
> mounting adapter or changing to a Porsche battery that is narrow and
> longer than the more standard size Exide I have now.  It would be nice
> to find that Porsche offered a different size that more closely
> matched off the shelf sizes such that I can use mounting hardware that
