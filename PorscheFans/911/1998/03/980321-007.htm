Hi all,

I was wondering... Are there tech sessions going on as part of PCA local
clubs or just organized by "people who know" (TM) once in a while ? 
It's just that there is so much stuff I don't know about fixing my car
that some of you would call child's play (like repacking bearings
etc..), that maybe others could benefit from seing how it's done once by
"people who know"(tm), and subsequently be able to do it themselves, for
a lot less $$$ than the local mechanic would charge you...

Of course, "people who know" (tm) could get taken to lunch, or brought
beer, or whatever by us "people who ain't got a clue", for passing on
the knowledge...  

Just a thought...;-)    Greg.

PS: So, anyone planning... suspension work, oil change, valve
adjustment, whatever, in the bay area these days ?  ;-)
