> Small payback here for some of the excellent tips i've benefitted from off
> the list. Concerning synthetic oils 
> Consumer Reports tested 20 popular oils and published the results in their
> 7/96 issue. They ran 75 New
> York City taxi cabs a total of 4.5 million miles changing oil & filters at
> 6000 mile intervals. Then they 
> dismantled the engines and measured wear on the crank main and con rod
> journals,cam lobes, cylinders,pistons, rings, main and con rod bearings
and
> valve stems. Bottom line was that they found no
> measureable differences between the engines that were run with synthetics
> versus the engines using
> the other oils. This publication accepts no advertising monies from anyone
> so i would think they are 
> unbiased . The report is available for viewing on thier web site at
> www.consumerreports.org .
