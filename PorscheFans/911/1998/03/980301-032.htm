Phillip,

You may both be right. I do know that in my C4, the wear sensor is a loop of
wire, and if that loop is not intact, the brake pad wear light will come on.
I also observed some behavior that suggested that the mere grounding (wire
touches rotor) of the wear sensor wire will also turn on the light, but I
didn't test it to confirm. They do like to play it safe when it comes to
brakes!

Sorry to be a bit pedantic, but I understand the sensor to be a wire
encased in plastic. As the pad wears down, the plastic wears away until
eventually the wire is exposed, makes contact with the disk completing the
circuit and causing the light to come on.
