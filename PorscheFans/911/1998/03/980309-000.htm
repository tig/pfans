To add further proof to the string on synthetics:
I have been using Mobil 1 in all three of my cars...911, 245DLA, and
Cherokee.  When I put 5w-30 in my wife's Volvo it began to drip onto my
garage floor (Damn!).  The car has 97K on it, but never leaked a drop
until I went to this low viscosity oil.  Before it had 10w-30,  or
20w-50, both synthetics, and never leaked.  The Cherokee, fairly new
with only 23K on it, never leaked a drop with the light weight oil in
it. 
 The 911 did not endure this stuff since it is a garage queen in the
winter.
When I went back to Castrol 10w30 in the Volvo the leak stopped (before
I got seriously interested in crank seals, which is where it was coming
from ).
Thus, proof that syns can cause leaks, but viscosity is also a factor.
More of my .02.
