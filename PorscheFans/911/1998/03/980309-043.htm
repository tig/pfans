PFans,

As a followup to recent questions about care of Fuchs wheels (David
McLaughlin) and paint/interior surfaces (Vic) , I have found the series
of car care articles I mentioned the other day.  They are on the
Sacramento Valley PCA site, in the technical section (address:
www.DerPorsche.net; add /tech.htm for technical page).  The articles
listed are:

Car Care Articles from Larry Reynolds

     Clean EngineAnd Culinary Delights
     The Care &; Feeding of Vinyl/Leather
     Taking Care of Cabrio Tops
     Cleaning Your Paint Part 1.
     Cleaning Your Paint Part 2.
     Cleaning Your Paint Part 3.
     How to clean a neglected car
     Cleaning Porsche Wheels
     Protect Your Porsche On The Track And Autocross
     Repairing Porsche Wheels
     Washing Your Porsche
     Covers For Your Porsches or other car
     Paint Chip Repair
     Got Squealing Brakes?

I found these to be very informative and educational regarding the wide
variety of products available.  Larry Reynolds also makes clear his
favorite products and his reasons for these preferences.   BTW, congrats
on your '88 Targa, Vic.  Sounds like a wonderful car!

As a side note, I recently received new SliverKnit Carpet ($400 + $30
for leather trim on carpet for pockets), fiberglass pockets ($125/pr),
and a German vinyl headliner ($100, sunroof version) from John at
Original Fit Interiors in Oregon (541.679.4460; thanks to Bob Spindel
for the referral!).  The materials are of excellent quality and the
pricing is as good as I have seen anywhere.  The pockets look especially
good when trimmed inside with black felt, available for minimal cost at
any good fabric store.

Hope this helps, and happy reading.
