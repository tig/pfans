Jeff boldy goes where few Pfans have gone before:
>> How would a bright yellow car look with a dark brown interior. I can't
make up my mind. OK or Yuk!

Hey Jeff,

One of the things I've always admired about the treatments of 911s with 
Speed Yellow exteriors is that they usually find a way to get an accent of 
yellow in the interior too. It provides a splash of color in an otherwise 
dark interior. So, whatever interior you pick see if you can apply, say, 
the yellow seat belt straps, or yellow piping on the seats, or maybe yellow 
leather around the shift ...  at least one of those I would think could be 
very stylish.

Also, there are yellows and yellows, by no means equal. For example I think 
that Speed Yellow showed off the shape and subtle curves of the Boxster (as 
it does the 911) much more than the standard pastel yellow that was 
offered. Different shades and reflectivities work better on some cars than 
others.

Caveat - I could barely handle a 6 color crayon box so I'm no expert on 
color :-)
