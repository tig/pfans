OK, I have been posting lots of messages lately.  I had to stretch my =
new Computer's legs.

I bought a 90 C4 about a month and a half ago.  The car G forces are =
impressive during acceleration and braking.  However,  it understeers =
heavily while turning.  I am very disappointed with this problem.  My 93 =
325 sedan beemer can turn faster and pull much higher Gs doing so.

My C4 has a very hard suspension which makes the ride pretty =
uncomfortable in the Chicago area where the streets are full of pot =
holes.  I would expect it to turn much better than my soft riding 325 =
sedan.

I tried different tire air pressures, etc.  Nothing seems to ease the =
problem.  The alignment of the front end seems to be very good.

Any comments?

Luis
