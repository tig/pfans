911 Fans,

It's almost that time! ... Yes the weather is tailing off (sounds like a =
new expression for C-2 & C-4 deceleration) and it's time to think about =
getting the 911 up and ready.  I have a questions about the plastic =
floating ball in the A/C condenser unit located in the front left =
fender.  I have charged the unit previously, however the ball never =
seems to float when the engine is up to temps and the A/C unit on for =
any duration?  There is a little bit of fluid on the bottom, but no =
appreciable 'floating' of the bubble occurs?

Does the system have enough freon, or is more pressure usually needed?  =
The cooling ability is good and doesn't indicate that the pressure is =
low.  Any A/C experts out there?

Thanks for your reply in advance.

Joseph
