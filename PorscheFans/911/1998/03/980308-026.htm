Hello 911-fans.  This is my first posting and I am brand new to the list.  I
hope my word-processor formatting comes through ok on e-mail.

I'm having a mysterious and frustrating problem with my turn signal flasher
units.  My  1969 911 is burning out turn-signal flasher relays, one after
another, although amazingly, the turn signals work perfectly for awhile after
each burnt flasher unit is replaced, until the next unit again fails.  I
really need help in diagnosing the problem.  In a nutshell, here are the
symptoms:  

The turn signals worked fine for years until, one day, a bizarre flashing
pattern began in the bulbs of the turn indicators located in the tach face.
They would BOTH flash at a regular rate of about one c.p.s., no matter where
the turn signal lever was located (left, right, or no-turn).  During this
period (incredibly), the turn signal lamps in each fender worked perfectly.
After two days, the dash indicator bulbs came on continuously, and about one
day later, the whole system failed (no turn indication on the dash, and no
response at the quarters). 

I replaced the flasher unit with the current replacement part from the dealer
(PN 914.618.303.11).  Not surprisingly, eveything was fixed and worked
perfectly.  BUT, several days later, the dash indicator bulbs began to flash
autonomously AGAIN.  And, several days after that, the whole rig failed again
(no turn signal function of any kind).  The only thing I could assume was that
(a) my long-term, older flasher had simply worn out, and (b) the replacement
flasher was a defective unit.

So, I replaced the flasher relay again with the same type, from Automotion
this time (still, it was $35 dollars !!!!!; would have been $3-5 for any other
car).  As before, with a new blinker unit everything worked PERFECTLY, for
about a week.  Then, it failed again, this time WITHOUT the warning phenomena
of slow alternating flashing of both the tach indicator bulbs.

Something profoundly wierd is going on, but neither my mechanic or I has a
clue as to WHAT or WHY.  I have gone through three flasher units;  all fail
after several days, but each time, replacement of the flasher unit yields a
perfectly operating turn-signal flasher system, FOR A WHILE.  I have tested
both unused and failed flasher units with a multimeter, and have proven that
the "burned-out" flasher units develop an open-circuit (infinite resistance)
between one of the four terminals and the other three terminals (new units
have measurable resistances between all permutations of terminals checked,
most combinations being about 4 megs.)

Throughout this fiasco, there have been no other wiring or mechanical
problems, no attempts to play with the wiring, no bulb changes, etc.  Of note,
it is my understanding that the 1969 cars had a sort of hybrid electrical
system - a transition system between the 356-type wiring of the early 911s and
912s, and the modern wiring layout of the 1970-on cars.  I have both wiring
diagrams (VERY DIFFERENT!!), and over the years, I have come to conclude that
my car is mostly like that of the later cars.

One other concern:  The parts guy at the dealer told me that the original type
of flasher unit that came from the factory hasn't been available for a decade
or more, and that "all the older 911s" have had a slight modification to the
flasher circuit to allow them to use the current available flasher replacement
unit from Hella or other suppliers.

Can anyone tell me what is going on?  WHY a car would burn out flasher units
so quickly, but, operate perfectly for awhile with a replacement unit?? WHY
there would be a 2 day "warning" period in which the two dash turn indicators
would flash independently of the lever, yet the car's actual turn signal lamps
operate perfectly??

HELP !!!
