Help!   Anyone ever had this happen?  The ignition switch turns clockwise ON
just fine but is very hard to turn counterclockwise OFF.  It seems to be worse
the longer the car is run.  Just came abck from a 3 hour drive and the switch
would absolutly not turn off short of breaking the ignition key.  After
sitting about 1/2 hour with the headlights off and the car running -- it
finnally turned OFF though with great difficulty.  Also it seems to turn only
a few degrees at a time so it takes several attempts to finally get the car
turned of.  If you turn it back on immediately it turns ON with almost no
effort.  

By the advice of several people I have sprayed WD40 inside the key hole and
Silicone around the perimiter of the key guide.  The latter seemed to help.
If you turn htback and forth, it seemes to loosen up.  

Any ideas?  

Thanks In advance (TIA)
