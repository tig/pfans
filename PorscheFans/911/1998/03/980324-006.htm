Bruce,
 I have the Cool Brake kit on my '86 and I'm very please
with it. The intakes fasten to the bottom of the A-arm
and I haven't had a problem with them hitting anything
even when driving on dirt roads.
 OG Racing sells the Cool Brake kit and AJ USA sells something
similar. I asked Jerry Pelegrino of EPE if one was preferable
to the other and he said the OG Racing one had a larger hose
(I *think* that was what he said.) so I went with that one.
  They seem to extend brake pad life. A friend lost one at
an event and drove with only one (until he could order another
I guess). When it came time to replace the brake pads, the 
"uncooled" ones were down to metal and the "cooled" ones had 
significantly more material left.
