I would be interested to hear from anyone who has done extensive dyno 
testing on the 1972 / 73 RS2.7 Carreras.

Factory listed as 210hp .....

Our race series rules dictate that the engine must remain completely stock, 
ie no internal mods, not even balancing etc. Exhaust systems are free, fuel 
is limited to pump (96 unleaded) or avgas (100 octane), air cleaner boxes 
must be in place and unmodified but filters may be changed (ie the K/N saga) 
or removed.

We are permitted a 5% margin for dyno error etc allowing a theoretical 
maximum of 221 hp.  We have had several experts from overseas give the 
opinion that it is impossible to get much in excess of this from a standard 
motor.

One car, reported to be fully legal and with an engine  not touched this 
season has just returned a figure of 238 hp.

Is this possible ...  or should the driver challenge the dyno results.
(It is not me .. or my car ... Im just interested in getting facts straight)

Thanks in advance for any replies.
