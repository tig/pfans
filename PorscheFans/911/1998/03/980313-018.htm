Hello P-Fans,

I have a 1979 930 with the 'climate control' dial box down in between the
front seats.  The unit was only operating in On/Off fashion.  I had my
wrench take a look at it and he said the unit was shot.  The cost to
replace the unit is $1,300 + $200 labor.  In the meantime, he disabled the
unit and enabled the little lever that sits next to the dial box (emergency
heat control I believe).  He said that I would be able to control the
amount of warm air that will come into my cabin this way.  This was fine,
but I quickly realized that the heat only stays on now, no matter if I
raise or lower the lever arm.  This is okay for the winter, but with the
warmer weather coming around the corner, I was hoping that someone on this
list would know of a fix to this heating problem that won't cost me $1,500.
Is the dial box repairable by a DIY'er?

Thanks in advance for any alternate solutions to this heating problem.
