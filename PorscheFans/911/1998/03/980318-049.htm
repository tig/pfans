Hello to everyone,

I have the distributor of my 90 C4 taken apart in the garage.  I was =
attempting to replace the belt which is almost worn completely.  I took =
the caps out, unscrew the center screw from the shaft, unclip the =
springs and took out the round metal thing with the wires, unscrew the 5 =
hex screws that hold the bottom (belt housing) to the rest of the piece =
but I'm stuck at this point.  I can't pull the belt housing out because =
something is still holding the shaft (hard to explain.)  Has anyone done =
this before?  I think that I'm at the point were normally experience =
kicks in and helps.  There has to be a trick to taking the rest of this =
piece apart to be able to replace the belt.

P l e a s e   H e l p !

Luis
