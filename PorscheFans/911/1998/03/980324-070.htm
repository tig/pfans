I don't know if what I am about to suggest fits your description, but I
definitely do know of one way that oil can leak "inside" a 911:

- Recently I discovered that, in my father's 1983 911-SC, oil (turned
out to be gear oil) has collected within the center tunnel.  A certain
amount of this oil leaks to either side, beneath the floormats. 
Investigation has shown that the front (nearest to the actual front of
the car - headlights) seal of the transmission, where the shift rod
extends out of the gearbox, is leaking.  The rubber bellows that seal
the shift rod from the elements keeps the leaking gear oil from
dripping, thus all the leaking oil ends up in the center tunnel within
the car.

I have not yet attempted to replace this seal, but just looking at
everything pretty much shows that this seal is the culprit - I plan to
fix it this spring.
