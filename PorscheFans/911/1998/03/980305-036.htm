The image at http://www.kindel.com/Porsche/Images/radar1.jpg shows where the
remote display is mounted.

The image at http://www.kindel.com/Porsche/Images/radar2.jpg shows the
detector itself mounted via the suction cups to the *left* side of the
windshield. 

The remote display is mounted to the steering column with some velcro. Note
that you want to remember to mount it on the part of the column that doesn't
turn (Trust me. I felt pretty stupid the first time I went around a corner
after installing the thing <g>). I really like the remote mount, especially
at night.

The wire from the remote display goes through the dash (between the column
and dash) to where I mounted the little RJ11 "plug box". There's a bracket
just to the left of the ashtray under the dash to which I affixed the "plug
box". 

The coiled wire from the detector goes down around the left side of the
column (in front of the blink er) to the plug box. I can unplug it easily to
take the detector to my other car (where I keep the cigarette lighter
adapter).

I find this works very well. It's a bit odd having to mount the detector
kind of cock-eyed, but the forward looking sensor points straight forward
(over the wipers) and the rear facing sensor "looks" over my left shoulder.

Subject: where do you mount YOUR Valentine One?


Just bought a Valentine One for my 1988 911 Targa, wondering where and how
people have theirs mounted? Seems to sit kind of high on the windshield to
get around the wipers. And is there a neater way to wrap the straight cord
vs. hanging the coiled one in front of the AC vents?

Thanks!
