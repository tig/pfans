I plan on lowering my '87 911 - it's mostly a pleasure car (family and 
all) and sees a few driver ed days a year - so I don't want to go too 
low!
Seems I've seen a recommendation in Excellence or Panorama in the 
recent past but cannot find it now.  I think it said either an inch or 
1/2 inch?
Anyone know where this stat can be found or have any experience with 
their own lowering?  
Also what other mods did you have to do? Struts? Bump steer correction?
Thanks for your help!
