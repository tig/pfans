>I have some information about the following :-

>Carrera RS - a 993 body with a 3.8 litre Varioram engine.
>Carrera RS Lightweight - the RS stripped
>Carrera RS Special - the mystery car
>Carrera RS Clubsport - apparently just 100 examples of this special were

Hello Chris,

The only information I have read on the 993 RS was in the November 95 issue of
Excellence magazine.  There were only two versions mentioned, one was the "RS"
and the other was the "RS Clubsport".  The Clubsport version was designed to
be race ready but both had the 3.8 litre 300 hp engine.  The article also
mentioned that there was going to be a total of 1200 of these cars to be made
but did not give a breakdown as to how many for each model.

Sorry, If I find any more info on this I will surely e-mail you again.

Viken
