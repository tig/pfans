Hey all,

Hope some of you are having nice weather.. ICK..

Anyways I went and looked at a 911 today (cause it's at a great
price). It had a lil fender bender and was sitting in the body
shop when I went to look at it. Not bad, but it's another targa
and I was hoping for a coupe.

Well anyways here is the skinny, need some of ya to look in your
trusty lil fact filled books for me and match VIN and Engine
number.

The car is blue with the normal chrome trim, S VDO gauges, 5
speed, oil cooler in front right fender.

Anyways here are the numbers

darn nevermind.. It's another plain ol 911. Just remembered all
the numbers you gave me previously.

911 - it's a 911
4 - 1974
1 - normal
1587 - serial number

motor 

6143347 - standard 2.7..

See I learn quick :)

Anyways, the car is in good condition, body is good (now) interior
is nice, except for seats, small crack in dash. Looks like 100K
miles. Some engine work, looked like new ignition, painted blue 11
blade fan. Narrow body, no oil leaks. No idear what other internal
stuff done.

Think I can get it for around $3500.00, but it's a targa, I
already have one, don't think I want another. Will see what I can
get out of the owner and see if I can't get it cheaper and make it
a daily beater or stock track car, or not..

The owner is going through some family stuff and just wants what
he has put into it since he hit what ever he hit to damage the
left front corner.

Thanks for being here :)
