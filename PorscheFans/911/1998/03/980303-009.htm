Dave made an interesting observation about an air cooled boxer being 
similar to an aircraft engine. Indeed it is.  Curiously enough about 
20 years ago (I think) Porsche was offering a version of the 911 
engine called the "phlugelmotor" (spelling is probably wrong). It was 
offered as a powerplant for light aircraft as an alternative to 
Lycoming and Continental. I saw a Cessna with one, and I've 
never heard what happened. Obviously withdrawn.  Anyone know the 
story?

Andy, I agree with your point on the filter. You took the notion to 
its limits.  In the real world, I'm not sure that the limits prove 
much except that a simple explanation is not always appropriate when 
dealing with rocket scientists. [:-)

I'd be a lot more confident if K and N came up with some reason why 
their filter improves performance. For instance if they had cunningly 
researched the airflow and contrived to build a surface pattern which 
enhances the flow thereby easing restriction without diminishing the 
capacity to filter small dirt particles, I'd be happier.

As to the interesting note regarding K and N on earth moving 
machinery, I suspect that K and N never designed their filters to 
operate in such an environment. The manufacturer of the machinery 
knew where that particular engine was going to work and provided 
exceptional paper filters as a matter of due precatuion. I don't 
fault K and N for anything on that account. 

In the final analysis, I replace my paper filters often. Up here they 
cost about 50 bucks.  That is a tiny fraction of what I spend on 
tires and cheap insurance against a costly rebuild.
