Gary,

At least I am not the only one in the world with these problems. I was
beginning to think I was on my own :) It does sound as if your problem
is worse than mine but there could still be a common cause!!

I did some more serious testing this weekend and it drops some times
after 5 mins slow driving and sometimes after 1 hours fast driving and I
don't know if I am completely mad :) but the problem usually occurs when
I am turning right abruptly or when slowing for traffic after fast
driving.

I have been told these problems are often related to surges on the power
lines (insufficient regulation on the alternator so the voltage goes too
high or low voltage on the battery) I had my car tested on the 'service
tool' and it is all OK but maybe that is your problem!

Anyone else have an idea?

Alan
