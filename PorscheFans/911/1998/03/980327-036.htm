Hello fellow P-fans,

Since there's been some trouble with the list (is it me, or what?), I'll
try this one again…

I'm trying to make up my mind on some suspension modifications for my '87
carrera, I thought I had done my homework pretty well, but now I'm puzzled.

I want to lower the ride-height, but not too extreme (not more than 1 inch
lower). For lowering the ride-height, should I use bigger torsionbars (I'm
thinking of 22mm front and 28 or 29mm rear)? My car is a daily driver and
though I'm not too concerned about my kidneys or comfort, I am concerned
about my car ratteling to pieces over rough surfaces.
I thought that to lower the car, I had to be aware for 'botoming-out' the
suspension because of the amount of suspensiontravel with standard 
torsionbars/shocks. I figured to get Bilstein sport shocks to deal with the
suspensiontravel and keep the standard torsionbars. Am I wrong?
Second I was thinking about installing 22mm adjustable swaybars, but now I
got a message that this is not advised for street driving. 

Any and all information is very much appreciated!
TIA
