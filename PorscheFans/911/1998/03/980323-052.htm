Ed,

If you had your car modified to use coil-overs on the front. it would
probably be worthwhile to provide the top of the shock towers with some
bracing. With a torsion bar car, there is not much point to it. It won't
hurt anything to do it. It just won't gain you much, if anything.

If you were going to make changes to the cars suspension and you had to do
it in stages, I would start with sway bars and then the torsion bars.
