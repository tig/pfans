Greetings Pfans!  How many of you are dissatisfied from the low frequency =
response of your stereo?  How do you get good lows in a 911?  good Bass =
requires lots of space, 911s do not have a lot of space....hmmmmm
I understand that many have had good results with the Audio Innovations =
box. (Rod, if you get a call from Steve at Audio Options in Torrance, I =
gave him your number, they want one of your boxes for a 911 that will be =
featured in some Car Audio mag, I forget which)
Anyways folks, I just had a JL Audio microsubwoofer installed in my 911.  =
While I may not win any sound off competitions, I am impressed with the =
results.  I used the 8.1 microsub which is a ported 8" enclosure.  It =
will fit behind either front seat, unless you are really tall, which I am =
not.  OR you can put it on the floor in front of the front passenger seat =
 since the enclosure is ported, you can face the speaker down and cover =
it with your floormat.  The enclosure looks like a tube, cut in half thus =
forming a semi-circle that is only 6 inches in radius.  Passengers will =
lose a little leg room, but since I rarely have passengers this works =
fine.  It also creates for good imaging, keeping most of the sound in =
front of you.
I had the normal JL Audio 8w0 speaker replaced with a higher power handlin=
g 8w6 model.  It sounds great.  And the enclosure will fit in the trunk =
if I need the space in a pinch, totally removable.
