Mike,
Although I was only reporting the results from Porsche's long term
testing and Tech Service Bulletin to dealers, after alittle thought it
might make some sense.  The failure modes they describe are
characteristic of long term stress and fatigue in metal (body attachment
points).  The loosened threaded fasteners are possibly a result of
vibration stress and natural harmonic resonance.  Given that, I would
hypothesize that the cause is the change in harmonic frequency and
purhaps the road shock amplitude transmitted by the greater metal to
tire ratio in an 18" combo versus a 17"; even though the overall
diameter (moment arm) is the same. Whew! ;^) I would agree that this is
amplified by the fact that greater grip and therefore greater stress is
imposed along with the switch to a larger diameter wheel, since they are
usually wider and have a greater contact patch as well.  

After all the tire is an air spring that dampens the road shock to the
wheel, which since the wheel is metal, transmits most of the remaining
shock to the suspension.  If the tire has a smaller aspect ratio because
the wheel is bigger it is essentially a stiffer spring and more of the
spike goes to the metal components.  Anyone who has changed to stiffer
springs has felt this, the bump is usally sharper and can rattle your
teeth if stiff enough.  My guess is Porsche found that the combo of 18"
wheels and lower ratio tires over time had the right harmonic frequency
(sharpness) and amplitude (total shock transmitted/not absorbed)  to
cause the metal failure.  17" apparently are fine as I found no TSB
claiming them "not allowed on cars not originally fitted" for them.

Personally, one of the reasons I bought a Porsche is because the guys
from Zuffenhausen are excellent engineers.  If they've tested it and say
it's going to cause me to visit the weeds unexpectedly,  I tend to
believe it.
