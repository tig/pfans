Ernie, I can't speak about 3.2 Carreras, but my 1980 911SC has 213,500
miles on the original engine. I have added Carrera Tensioners (at
151,000 when I bought it from the original owner). Oil consumption
appears to be 1 quart (synthetic)/5,000 miles. I hope to make it to
300,000 miles before I consider a rebuild. The car is a daily driver so
it gets to temperature nearly every time I drive it. I suspect that
regular driving and routing maintainance is what keeps it alive.

I should point out that while the engine is strong, other things have
gone (fuel pump, distributor, starter, etc.). My mechanic says Porsches
tend to wear out from the outside in.

Regards, Bob Fagaly
