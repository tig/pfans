Hi Robert & 911 PFans,

As Dennis notes above, Porsche does in fact have a web site for Germany
(and for other non-US) Porsche owner locations.  Their address is
http://platz.com/pca/germany/pcagrhm.html.

  Our NEW web address is: 
 http://platz.com/pca/germany
  You can still reach us at the old address listed above. 

  Look at the 'Goodies store'
on their home page and you will note that they have UpFixin' volumes as
well as the index for sale in limited quantities (some later volumes,
8-10, are currently out of stock).   Prices are comparable to US.

  Our Goodie Store just received a batch of new Up-Fixin volumes on 
14 Feb. Plenty of volumes 8-10, price is the same as from PCA, 
excluding shipping.  However, these go fast. Quite a few of them were 
sold at our Porsche AG factory tour/Weissach tour/track driving day 
on 18 Feb. 

  If anyone has any questions concerning the PCA-Germany Region, I 
will be happy to answer them.
