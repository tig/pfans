Walt, (and PFans Micheal and Lou)
  I gettrans parts from  Gary Fairbanks, 5 synchros for $100
for example. He advertises in Pano & Excellence. He's
not a real "people person" so know what you need before
you call. Every time I've ordered from him and I needed
a small used part (big pinion shaft nut, detent spring)
he's given it to me for free. I also bought a used cam tower
off him and it was in excellent condition at a fair price.
  I've limited my fun to the main & pinion shaft gears and
left the diff alone. I'd like an excuse to mess with the 
diff (put in an LSD?) but it looks like it would be a difficult 
job from a tools perspective. Heck, I don't even own any 
machinist's blue!
  As far a tools go, an old pro like yourself probably
has tricks I don't know about (so feel free to enlighten
me please!) but this is what I have used or had someone
else use for me (like the syncro tools). 
- Fork tool (this is so cheap there is no excuse not to have it)
- Torque wrench 
- 41mm deep socket - like 14 _inches_ deep! (can get buy 
         without this one but what a neat tool)
- 41mm torque wrench adapter - a plate with a
   1/2" square hole for the torque wrench and a 41mm
    hexagonal hole for the "big nut" on the mainshaft
- Impact wrench (+ air compressor)
- Big vise with aluminum jaws
- Factory manuals or equivelent
- Hydraulic press
- Neat synchro removal tools (2 required, one for 1&2nd and another for
3,4,5)
- Heat gun
- Drain plug hex drive

Automotion sells the neat synchro tool.

Chris - what's your tranny parts source?  

My system for keeping the tool cost down is to farm out swapping the
dog teeth and setting pinion depth (which isn't routine, luckily).  What
other tools do you think one needs for ordinary work?  I bought one of
those plates for setting forks, but haven't had to use it yet and a
mechanic friend said he fakes this part.   Dealing with 2d gear synchro is
as deep as I have gotten other than putting everything except the pinion
shaft back into a case (long story).  The dial indicator for setting cam
timing works fine for ring backlash when dealing with quaifes and the
like. (though I did borrow a nice special tool there).
