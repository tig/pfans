Here's an interesting point on the oil debate...

------- Forwarded Message Follows -------

Keep in mind that synthetics may work well in Water Cooled engines, but
Air/Oil Cooled is a big difference. Curtis Pyatt mentioned that these
synthetic motor oils do not allow the heat to dissipate as well as
conventional Motor Oils. That is my chief concern!!!

A hot running engine can shorten the driving pleasure of your car.
