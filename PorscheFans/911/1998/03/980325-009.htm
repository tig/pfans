Hi Jim,

The subject of removing the rear undertray on the 964 series cars comes up 
on the list every few months. I removed my rear tray two years ago based on 
list consensus and sage advice from Bruce and my local mechanics that 
increased valve guide wear can result from trapped heat in the well 
insulated tray.

The arguments I recall for keeping the tray came down to (1) radiated sound 
deadening, (2) improved underbody airflow, and (3) if Porsche put it there 
who are we to remove it.

The counterarguments were that (1) the tray lowers sound emissions to meet 
ROW standards, such as the Swiss limits, and without the tray the car is 
not noticeably noisier. (2) There is no evidence for aero improvement, and 
much evidence in the form of Porsche race cars without any under-engine 
trays, to show that this can't impart any significant advantage. (3) Most 
of the people on this list are as apt to take a wrench or a screwdriver to 
the car as anyone, and feel that the car is the better for it. (With all 
due respect to the Factory.)

So, I took it off. Haven't noticed that much more noise. Haven't had any 
noticeable change in engine temps. Hope that I've given a few more 
kilo-miles to my top end.

Cheers,
