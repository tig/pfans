Perhaps I am stating the obvious but felt that it had to be said as I am a
believer in the beauty of a factory finished Fuchs wheel:  Any sanding or
polishing of an anodized wheel, such as the Fuchs, will permanently remove the
anodizing or protective chemical layer.  As most of us do not have access to
the tanks and chemicals to put this coating back, the only way to have these
wheels truely restored is to send them to a shop, such as Wheel Enhancement or
others, that performs this service.  Just be very careful with your Fuchs if
you want them to look nice.  Male dogs, car washes, any abrasives, acids, etc.
are all enemies.  Vasoline is, as we have recently been reminded, good as it
imparts a protective layer without attacking the anodized layer.

The 944 TurboS and 1989 Turbo forged wheels, as well as the corresponding 928
wheels, were also anodized and I am sure there are others that I cannot think
of now.  Other Porsche wheels, such as the 964/993 and other recent variations
are painted and clear coated.
