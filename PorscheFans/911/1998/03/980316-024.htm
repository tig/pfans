Ned,  I bought my Targa from the original owner (a doctors wife) nearly 5
years ago. It was a high milage car with 151,00 miles on it. Asking price
was $9,700. One reason for the apparant low price was a rather obvious
sound for the transmission area that increased with speed. I had the
pre-buy inspection done at AJ-USA and they identified $5,700 in needed
repairs. I offered $9,000 which was accepted and had a new right rear wheel
bearing replaced (the cause of the sound, not the (costly) transmission
work which the owner thought it was), the fuel injection (plastic) boots
were replaced (they were rotting) and I had Carrera tensioners installed.
In the couple of weeks between my buying the car and the work being done,
it was obvious that it leaked oil. After the engine work, the oil
consumption dropped to 1 quart every few thousand miles and absolutely no
leaks on the garage floor. The mechanic swore by Redline (at $7.50/qt) and
that's what I used until I switched mechanics (he went out of business). I
now use Castrol Syntec, but Bruce Anderson has recommended that I switch to
Mobil 1 (as he says, "um good").

Regarding leaks, I suspect that the key to a non leaking 911 is to properly
reassemble the engine. By the way, my 911 has started leaking slightly (oil
consumption is still very low)--I supect that it is an oil line loosening
up. I will be taking it in for a 15,000 tune up and will have the guys at
Black Forest see if it is an oil line. I don't know about 930 covers,
perhaps others on the list might comment.

Regarding oil treatments, I was the Tech Session chairman of San Diego PCA
for the past two years. We had a guy from Prolong do one session and
discussed engine treatments. Apart from his comments (which are consistent
with what follows), AVOID any Teflon based engine like the plague! Some
people have the idea that if one treatment every 50,000 miles is good, one
every 5,000 must be really good--which is followed by a blown engine 15,000
miles later as the Teflon additives has accumulated (through overuse) so
much as to block the oil flow paths in the engine. The Prolong guy said
that DuPont (inventors of Teflon) has stated that they do not warrant the
use of Teflon additives in automotive applications.

Regarding Slick 50, the Prolong guy gave lots of anecdotal reasons why it
was so good and even offered some good chemical engineering reasons why it
worked. However, I am a physicist (http://www.tristantech.com) and would
have liked to see experimental data.
I use synthetics. They are relatively homogeneous and are less prone to
breakdown than conventional oils--very important in an air-cooled motor!
What I find interesting is that Porsche recommends 15,000 between oil
changes (or is it now 30,000 miles?). My oil change sequence is every 7,500
miles which works out to be around every 6 months. The 911 is a daily
driver (20 miles each way) and it gets to temperature every week day
(Sunday is Church, so it only sees 10 miles then). The car is not
autocrossed (not enough time, I work 6 days/week) so it really is
understressed. I look forward to the day when I am understressed and the
911 is overstressed.

Regarding water leaks, living in San Diego (El Nino north), the Targa has
always leaked, mostly in the glove compartment area. Luckily in San Diego
it doesn't rain that much (until recently) so I ignore it on the 14 days a
year it normally rains. No leaks through the rollbar or wet seatbelts
(except when my 10 year old aims the hose when we're washing the 911 & I
hadn't put the windows up in time <g>).

I hope this helps.
