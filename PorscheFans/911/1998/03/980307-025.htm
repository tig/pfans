Good synopsis!

My new (to me) 78 SC has several FI glitches that are decidedly not
"factory spec", but are minor annoyances rather than real defects, and
are definitely based on age.  Have decided to replace individual
components in a logical manner (for the car's current operating
condition), and eventually, over time and at a reasonable cost,
eliminate the weird CIS habits of my vehicle.

First on the list is to replace all FI hoses, which at the age of 20
years, are a bit brittle.  After certain that the system is airtight,
then will attack the individual components, depending on symptom.

Would also suggest to those who are swapmeet savvy to look into buying a
complete spare CIS injection system from the suitable year.  They aren't
generally too expensive ($200-300, LA-Pomona prices) and it doesn't hurt
to have backups in case of a component failure.
