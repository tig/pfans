Well after 6 months of waiting, the transport arrived Monday with my '83 930.
Car has been in storage since '86 after being recovered from theft.  A long
glance at the Odometer shows a whopping 2433 miles.......PO didn't get much
use out of this one!!!!  Anyway its in great shape, except that over the years
it's been picked over by various "parts thieves" so I decided to put it though
a complete makeover.  I'm pulling the entire interior (its burgundy, great
color) all the glass, and trim to prep it for its new color.....Brandywine
candy over black pearl.  I am in need of some parts so here goes,  oh by the
way its a factory slantnose also!
   Parts needed:  front bumper (need everything, nothing there!)
                          Front Valance (looking for '84 or newer style with
fogs in valance)
 
Next question, lots of little parts missing, does anyone have or know how I
can get a  complete parts breakdown?  Microfische? I'm not looking to make it
totally original, but want to know whats "missing in action".                 
I'm debating whether or not to pull all the electrical, and replace/rewire to
90's tech.(i.e. autofuses, newwer relays) I am very capable of doing all of
this myself, and don't cring at the thought of doing something some would find
unthinkable.

TIA for any and all thoughts, 
Am I a glutton for punishment?
NO, I just LOVE working on great cars, and a Porsche is the
greatest!!!!!!!!!!!
                                          
PS. dropping the engine this weekend.
