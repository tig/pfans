    Don:

    It's not loud enough to break windows, but the Bursch muffler
    might piss off your neighbors and attract the attention of the
    police... It's pretty loud.

    I routinely set off car-alarm motion sensors just by driving
    past them, and when I drive the car cross-country, I wear
    earplugs... Seriously.

    I don't know enough about the other exhausts to know which ones
    will offer the same performance without the noise... Sorry.

    I can do better than that; if you'd like to hear it, point your
    web browser to:

    You'll need RealAudio Player (or RealPlayer) to hear the
    sound... To get the right effect, crank your PC's volume control
    all the way up.
