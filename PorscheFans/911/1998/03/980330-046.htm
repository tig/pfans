SEBRING 1998 RACE
Jim Stephenson’s 
track report

The 46th year of the Sebring International Sports
Car Race was held Saturday, March 21st.   Located
in central Florida, Sebring is the oldest sports car
endurance race in the US. It is both an historic race,
and a very demanding course of 3.6 miles run on an
old airfield used in WWII.  It brings participants
from around the globe. 

The 12 hour race began at 10:15 AM and ended at
10:15 PM.  This endurance race, unlike the 24 hour
race at LeMans and Daytona, runs for only 12 hours.
One racer told me the race track is so rough that cars
could not last 24 hours. But, later this year the new
owners -Panoz Motor Sports - plan major
improvements.  

Almost one-half  of the 58 cars entered  were
Porsches (25) in GT-1 GT-2 and GT-3 classes. With
17 previous overall victories, plus 61 class wins,
Porsche is the most successful manufacturer in the
history of the Sebring race.  

Of special interest to me was the Porsche entries of
PCA members I know, especially racers who have
been on racetracks with me in the “Red Instructor”
group during PCA Driver Ed  events. They include
such people as Art Pilla of  NNJR and Martin Snow
(GT-2), of Utah Region.  Other well known Porsche
racers included Hans Stuck ( Sebring wins-3),
Hurley Haywood (most Sebring top 10 finishes-11),
Andy Pilgrim, Larry Schmacher, Dennis Aase,
Derek Bell, Dave Murry and Bob Wollek 

There was a very nice Porsche Club hospitality area
which was sponsored by Florida Suncoast Region
and Porsche dealers.  If you go to a future race, I
would  recommend the friendly southern hospitality
of this PCA group for parking and watching the
race. The Florida weather was warm and sunny,
except for Friday when it rained all day.  

Only about 30 cars were still in the race by nightfall.
So, who won? The winning car in WSC class (World
Sport Car) was a Ferrari driven by Theys, Moretti
and Baldi.   The Ferrari WSC won by 1 lap over the
second place Panoz -Ford GTR1 of Wallace and 
Brabham. This was a good result for Panoz -Ford,
which  have suffered from engine problems. Third
place overall, and second  place in the GT1 class
went to a Porsche GT1 driven by Boutsen, Wollek
and Andy Pilgrim. 

The GT2 class was won by a Porsche driven by Nick
Ham, (CO). and Konrad. Second place in GT2 was a
Saleen Ford by the Saleen, Johnson, Archer team. In
GTS-3, the Porsches were beaten by the BMW.  Art
Pilla finished 22nd. Hurley Haywood, Derek Bell
and David Murry, driving a Ford R&S WSC car had
engine problems and finished 24th. 

This was my third race at Sebring.  Race results were
similar to 1997, when GT1 was won by an Olds
Aurora, and GT3 was won by BMW.  Porsche
finished 9 of the top 20 spots.
