Here is what happened to my 78 Targa.  Sitting at a light when the car
dies.  Restarted it but had to fight to keep the revs up and it was running
very rough.  Then started to backfire and miss badly.Finally got it through
the intersection and into a parking lot where it died and wouldn't restart.
Checked the wiring and everything seemed in order.  Got back in and it
restarted, ran a little rough then smoothed out and ran fine.  I was only a
few blocks from my mechanic so I went straight there.  Of course it ran
perfect.  He thinks it is a CD unit going bad but there is no way to know.
My question is since the original replacement part is about a 1,000, is
there a less expensive alternative?  I've looked at the Permatune units and
others for less money.  Is there a Jacobs for these models?  Any advise
would be helpfull.  Thanks.
Lyle Bruce
