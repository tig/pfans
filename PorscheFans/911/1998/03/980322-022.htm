I hope I'm not becoming a bother but trust me once I'm up to speed
and confident I will take on as many newbie questions as
possible..

Temps, I got an Email from another list member that stated oil
temps should really not go over 200. That's cool but today driving
around town for let's say an hour the temps got to 210 and sat
there, is that bad? If so what could be the cause?

I have many oil coolers, I have the oil cooler under the nose of
the car, and another aftermarket cooler in the turbo tail location
(in lid).  they both look pretty clean and the front one has some
sort of metal mesh cover (looks factory) but I was told the 911
targa standard only had the fender mount, I have the front.. Yes
obviously could have been added.

So what do I do if this is a problem or even if it's not that big
of deal. 

Thanks again...
