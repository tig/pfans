I just did this 2 weeks ago!  (On my '87).  In replacing the front inserts you
will definitely find out if you have the washer.

The replacement is fairly simple. A couple of points to help out, drawing from
a variety of previous posts:

1. You'll need some tool to keep the strut cover (the upper cylindrical piece)
stationary while you loosen the nut at the top of the assembly from the trunk
area, and to loosen the old and tighten the new "ring nut" or "gland nut" that
holds the insert into the strut tube.  I used a large pipe wrench for removal
(I had Boge originals) and Bilstein provided a spanner wrench with the inserts
for tightening the new ring nut.

2. Once you've removed the nut at the top of the strut, you'll need to (most
probably) use your floor jack to lift the wheel assembly up to compress the
strut, then let the assembly back down (with strut compressed) to let the
threaded upper part out of the top bushing.

The whole strut assembly needs to be swung out from under the fender area in
order to remove and replace the insert, so that's how you'll find out if you
have the washer.  Some people need to disconnect the brake line to swing the
strut out; I did not have to (barely) but had to loosen the brake sensor wires
from a mount on the strut tube and turn the steering wheel all the way to one
side.

In my case the front replacement was easier than the rear because everything
was easy to get to.  I needed to remove the air filter box in its entirety, and
the heater blower, to get at the rears' top nuts with enough room to move 2
wrenches around back there.
