Vic,

My '88's temp/pressure gauge does the same thing. I asked on the list about
it, just like you, and the only real response I got was to drill a little
hole in the glass. I have not yet done this because

#1 I don't know if it would be better to drill the hole high or low.
#2 I'm not sure what kind of bit to use. It would be a bummer if I cracked
the face, although it probably wouldn't fog anymore :-)
#3 I don't like the idea of drilling my 911, anywhere!

Another idea I had, but I'm not sure about, was to take the gauge out and
see if I could get the glass off. If so, I'd wipe it down with an anti-fog
cloth. Perhaps combining this with drilling a vent hole...

If you do try it, let me know how it goes.
