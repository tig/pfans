Andy:

I don't completely agree with you conclusions.  Data should not
be dismissed unless you have more relevant data that you are using.

I have not read the New York study, but I believe that low RPM 
stop and go driving causes much more wear on engine parts than
driving in a fashion that we would consider normal.

I agree that the New York data may not apply, but until I read
a test report that had conditions closer to my driving habits, I
tend to believe.
