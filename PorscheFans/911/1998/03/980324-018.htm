1. What about the speakers. The Pro 6.2 set has a 6.2 inch (logical,
isn't it) mid/bass driver and a 1 inch tweeter. To get the sound these
speakers produce (they are GOOD !), the mid/bass driver is rather deep
and heavy. Can I replace the standard speakers in the front doors with
these ? How do I get to them ? What do I need to look out for ?


Yes, I have a set of these in my 80 SC Targa, they fit in the existing =
holes, and yes they do sound SWEET!!
I have a CD by the Gypsy Kings that sounds like the band is sitting on my =
dash clapping hands.

2. I need to hide away the crossovers. Where to I put them (under the
dash ?). 

 I believe the installer put mine inside the doors.

3. And the amplifier ? I was thinking about the passenger footwell (can
I put anything behind the foot rest ?). Any considerations regarding
possible interference (I is only a 2x70W amp).

I have a Precision power PC 450 (4x50w) in the trunk.  It is mounted on a =
piece of particle
board that also has a bracket which slides into a slot adjacent to the =
front compartment.  
It is removable when access is required.


4. Any ideas on the CD Changer. I saw one in the boot, standing up,
close to passenger side wheel. All suggestions on placement and mounting
tips are very welcome.

There are some units which will fit under the driver's seat, although =
personally I think
that this would be difficult to access.  I vote for the boot standing up. =
I just have a single CD
player so I don't have this issue.
