I just had my '81 engine apart and went through all the CIS parts.  I don't
remember any electrically connected parts in this area of the engine
other than the warmup regulator itself, the frequency valve, and the cold
start fuel injector.  But I'll look again.

What I do remember is a vacuum line bypassing the throttle butterfly (I
think) which serves to power the power brakes (which I don't have, so I
blocked off that part).  The power brake (or so I suppose) part is a sort
of Y fitting.  On further investigation, this included a plastic tube, with a
second pyramidal plastic part inside of it.  I couldn't figure out what this
was for, although perhaps it created some sort of venturi effect to help
the brake system accumulate vaccuum. 

This engine (and the '77 Euro 2.7 which preceeded it) did have the cold
start air valve over between @5 and #6 cylinders - the one you test in
an oven and a freezer to see if it is closing and opening with
temperature, and which has its own bimetal system (or at least an
electrical connection I suppose serves that purpose).  

But after my rebuild my engine is suffering idle maladies it did not have
before, which is discouraging.
