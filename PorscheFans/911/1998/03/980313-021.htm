Denny,

I'll have a look this weekend to see what the damage is, I can't
believe though that Porsche built a car which can only handle such
weedy lamps.
I think I will go for some relays, see below..
Best Regards Andrew.

Do you know the maximum watts the switch can take in a standard
configuration?
Where are my fuses? (what a newbie)
I know its taking a liberty but could u sketch me a little circuit
diagram for the relays and fuses, I'm no electrician. I can then get a
friend who is to install them. Best Regards Andrew.
