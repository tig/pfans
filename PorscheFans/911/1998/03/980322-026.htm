I know that this isn't a Porsche question, but my wife has wanted to buy a
Jaguar XJS for sometime and there seems to be one available nearby us.  It's
a red 1990 XJS with tan leather interior/red piping and has only 34K miles
on the clock.  The car is in MINT condition and is a one owner car that was
used as a second car for nice sunny days and was garage kept (asking price
is 15K or best offer).  Since I am not familiar with the XJS would
someone be so kind to email any info on the XJS to me.  Information such as
what years to buy, what years not to buy, expected engine and transmission
life (car is a V12), and any problem areas with the car would be greatly
appreciated.
While I am asking questions, could someone explain the difference between
the XJS V12 engine and the H.E. V12 engine.  Thank you for your help.

P.S. Please keep the Jaguar jokes to a minimum
