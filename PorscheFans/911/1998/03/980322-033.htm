Hi Norm,

Welcome from another 911 newbie!  I'm going to stretch a little and see
if I can field some of your questions (not a stupid one among them!).
I'm using Bruce Anderson's 'Porsche 911 Performance Handbook, 2nd ed.'
as my main source, along with other information I've seen in various
Panorama (Porsche Club of America monthly magazine) and Excellence
magazine technical columns.  You ask some good questions, so I'm going
to see how much I've learned by answering them; other list members will
no doubt add to this discussion (and please correct me if I'm wrong).
By the way, your car sounds great, but you neglect to say what year it
is!

Depending of the year of your car, the name of the paint color (in
German!) may be on the door post along with the color code .  Try
calling Porsche Cars North America (800.PORSCHE, or the Customer
Commitment Group at 800.545.8039) and see if they will tell you what it
is, or get the factory cardex describing the options your car had when
delivered from the factory.

Case refers to the crankcase, into which the cylinder head studs are
threaded.  Helicoil and Time-Certs are both inserts into the case which
provide a stronger area for stud installation, and are used to
prevent/repair pulled or broken cylinder head studs.  Helicoil is
basically a wound piece of wire, where Time-Certs are a solid piece of
steel with special threading, and are preferred (see Bruce Anderson,
Performance Handbook, 2nd ed, pg 183 for an extended discussion).  I
don't believe there is an easy way to verify that these are installed
short of taking the engine apart.

>I can go with the Dilivar studs?

Divalar studs are made from a special steel alloy developed for racing
engines that attempted to match the thermal expansion characteristics of
aluminum cylinder heads and magnesium crankcases, thus lessening
failures due to thermal stress.  There are several versions of these
studs, which may be subject to other types of problems, especially
corrosion.  It would help to know what your cylinders and crankcase are
made of, as well as the specific type of stud used.  It also helps to
know if they were used on both the top and bottom rows of head retaining
studs.  Lastly, it is useful to know if the cylinder head cooling
deflectors were updated or modified (pg 184).

You are correct that RaceWare studs and Time-Cert threaded inserts seem
now to be the preferred approach in 2.7L engines.  Nonetheless, the key
issue may be how you drive the car, and under what conditions.  For a
street car with adequate cooling, good oil/filter changed routinely, and
moderate performance demands, your Divalar studs should not be of
excessive concern,especially since it has run 11K miles without any
problem (see Performance Handbook, pg 180-181).

>After opening the trunk and looking at the engine, I did see an
11-blade
>fan facing me.  Is the right one?

You got it.

>How can I tell an extra oil cooler has been added?  Where do I look?

Auxiliary oil coolers tend to live in one of three places: inside the
passenger side front wheel well, in the center of certain type of front
mounted air dams (spoilers), and in the rear tail.  My guess if yours
will be the first of these.

>How can I tell if Carrera tensioners are there?  Where do I look?

Inspection of the tensioners requires removal of the cam chain housing
covers on the front of the engine (on either side of the fan).  This is
an easy check for someone familiar with your engine.  Ideally, you want
3.2L Carrera-style pressure-fed hydraulic tensioners and updated chain
ramps and chains (Performance Handbook, pgs 52, 76, 86).

Hope this helps.  Looking forward to having you on the list.  Enjoy your
car!
