Guys,
  After 7 requests I guess this is probably of general interest
so I'll post it again. 
  I'm working on getting a source for the 41mm torque wrench 
adaptor (whose part # is no longer listed according to the 
SnapOn guy).  See Terry's response (below) for a less tool 
intensive approach.
   I'm not really qualified to tell you how to rebuild your 
transmission. 
 have fun,
 Chris

-------------Revised 915 trans tools list --------------
  I get trans parts from  Gary Fairbanks, 5 synchros for $100
for example. He advertises in Pano & Excellence. He's
not a real "people person" so know what you need before
you call. Every time I've ordered from him and I needed
a small used part (big pinion shaft nut, detent spring)
he's given it to me for free. I also bought a used cam tower
off him and it was in excellent condition at a fair price.
  I've limited my fun to the main & pinion shaft gears and
left the diff alone. I'd like an excuse to mess with the 
diff (put in an LSD?) but it looks like it would be a difficult 
job from a tools perspective. Heck, I don't even own any 
machinist's blue!
 This is what I have used or had someone else use for me 
(like the syncro tools). 
- Fork tool (this is so cheap there is no excuse not to have it)
- Torque wrench 
- 41mm deep socket - like 14 _inches_ deep! (can get buy 
         without this one but what a neat tool)
- 41mm torque wrench adapter - a plate with a
   1/2" square hole for the torque wrench and a 41mm
    hexagonal hole for the "big nut" on the mainshaft
- Impact wrench (+ air compressor)
- Big vise with aluminum jaw pads or a used clutch disk
- Factory manuals or equivelent
- Hydraulic press
- Neat synchro removal tools (2 required, one for 1&2nd and another for
3,4,5)
- Heat gun
- Drain plug hex drive
- 36mm socket for pinion nut
- strong circlip pliers (not the type with switchable tips)
- 911 engine stand (not necessary but oh so convenient)

Automotion sells the neat synchro tool.

	Chris:
	Interesting list of tools.  On mine I added 2 sockets to my
collection and that was about it.  I used an old clutch disk bolted to
my work bench to hold the primary shaft.  Took the big nut off with a
pipe wrench.  Wired the syncro rings with bailing wire so I could get
the snap rings back on and home brewed a press with wood spacers, 1 1/2
PVC pipe and a 6 lb. hand sledge.  I did farm out the removal and
pressing of the dog gears.

I am considering a rebuild of my 915 and would like the benifit
of your experience also.  Please include me on the copy list.
