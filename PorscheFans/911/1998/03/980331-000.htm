Hi Andrew, (and the rest of the PFANS)

I have an opportunity to get a set of headers and exaust at a excellent
price, but I want to have some opinions first. The components include a
set of SSI headers, Bursch muffler and all the oil lines to boot!
I would like to know if this is to agressive for the street or for that
matter, my year and model of car? If SSI or custom headers and a
complimenting muffler is to agressive for the street, do you have any
exaust recommendations that would give me the HP but also not piss off
the local cops, nieghbors or break windows? 

My Car:
I have a 85 911 with a 10.3:1 compression Euro engine w/cat and stock
muffler. I have been told when it was delivered in Germany that the only
difference was basically a bypass pipe where the cat is now and that in
its original condition produced 231 HP. I have also read that the best
way to improve the exaust (and HP) is with a SSI or equivalent header
and a good muffler (Bursch, ANSA, etc) ??????? As usuall, thanks for any
input!
 Don Harvey 

P.S. Could you describe the sound characteristics of your exaust system?
