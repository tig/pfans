>> I bought a 90 C4 about a month and a half ago.  The car G forces are =
impressive during acceleration and braking.  However,  it understeers =
heavily while turning.  I am very disappointed with this problem.  My 93 =
325 sedan beemer can turn faster and pull much higher Gs doing so. >>

As others have said, that's the way they are. BUT to add insult
to injury, Porsche put little 6" wide wheels on the fronts.
Running a 7" wide wheel with 225/50 tires will surely help.
Maybe you can get the same style wheel in 7" width.

A great upgrade I have seen on 964s is the stock 993 17"
cup wheels, 7" front and 9" rear. I don't know a good size for
the front in street tires however, but keep the front to rear
within 20-30mm (225/255 for example). The 993 wheels really
help the appearance of the 964 too, which I never liked much.

>> My C4 has a very hard suspension which makes the ride pretty =
uncomfortable in the Chicago area where the streets are full of pot =
holes.  I would expect it to turn much better than my soft riding 325 =
sedan. <<

With stock suspension it should not be hard. What springs and shocks
are in there? I'd recommend non-sport Bilsteins to get you over the
bumps and last a long time.
