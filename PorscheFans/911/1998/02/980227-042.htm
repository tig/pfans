Gary asks:

CV Joints:  Am planning to clean & repack the CV's soon.  The boots are
still in VG condition, no cracks or tears, but there are no clamps on them! 
Just some large tie-wraps holding the "open" end!  What kind of clamps
should be used?  Will hose clamps unbalance the axel shafts with the
heavier screw part?

CV - If by "open" end you mean the small end, don't bother putting
anything on it unless it leaks, then tie wrap just fine.  Carroll Smith
recommends leaving the small end alone so pressure can't build up in the
CV.  It is usually a reasonably tight fit on the axle, and the other end
holds the boot in place.  Has worked for me.  

If by "open" end you mean the big end on the CV flange, a hose clamp
won't be a balance problem - tires revolve around 850 times per mile, so
it isn't that fast (although we can feel tire imbalances), and the small
imbalance is going to be in the center of the large rotating mass of the tire
where it matters least.  If a tie wrap has done the job so far, why not? 
You are just holding a dust boot in place on a flange with a nice lip, not a
high pressure oil line.  I haven't tried that, but have used hose clamps
without problems. Oetiker clamps (the kind you pinch with a tool that
looks like a tile nipper - which is what I use, since I had one) work fine
alsoj, but who needs to hunt around for specialized stuff for this job.

Engine Bay Insulation:  Is it ok to just cut out the pad that is in there
until later in the spring when I have a few free weekends to do the job
right?  Or is it needed for heat protection, etc.?

It's OK.  Letting it sag down on the engine won't help engine cooling.  A
little more noise in the passenger compartment won't hurt.  You won't
roast your rear seat passengers either, should there be any.  I drove that
way all last year when the foam finally fell completely apart after years
of spraying glue in behind it to try to get it to restick and I pulled most of it
out.  Then again, my car is a bit loud anyway.

Clutch Cable:  What is involved in replacing the clutch cable?  How long
should I plan for this job?  I have to at least adjust the one that is there.  I
know the one I have is ok for a little while, but I have already bought a
new one since I noticed the bellow on the existing one is torn up and the
cable itself is starting to show some age.  If it's a big job, I'll probably wait
on that as well.

At least purchase the new one so you know you have one just like the
old one (maybe by '80 there was only one kind, no mixups, but on my '77
gray market car there were several possibilities) right there in your car
should yours break.  It's not going to break at noon on a Wednesday in
front of a Porsche dealer (mine broke ascending Rabbit Ears Pass, and
guess what luck I had finding this part in Steamboat Springs).  I'd
estimate an hour to do the swap, more or less, since you haven't done it
before, plus time you use fiddling with other things along the way.  Not
hard to do, but always a joy to work upside down in the footwell. 
Haynes ought to give you whatever information you need to do the job
and adjust it.

Trailer Hitch:  I've been looking into putting a light duty (I estimate a total
load of about 500lbs) hitch on the 911 in order to haul tires, tools, and
other stuff to the track since I can't afford a trailer/tow vehicle in the near
future.  Anybody done this?  Any comments from the list?  I called
U-Haul.  They have a hitch that can handle 1000lbs and costs $176 over
the counter and $199 installed.  They said it is the only hitch available and
requires some drilling (probably in the bumper?) to mount.  Are there any
other options?  Is drilling as bad as it sounds?  I would definately mount it
myself if I went this route.

Before I lost my mind after I remarried (no, it wasn't the other way round)
and went to a  race car and closed trailer, I used to pull a Checker Auto
special little utility trailer behind my 911 to events.  It's a great way to go.
After I had duded it up I could put 10 tires with jack, tool box, air bottle,
tire iron, 5 gal jerry can of gas, and lawn chair as well on that little
sucker.  If you lived out here I'd lend it to you with the hitch.

My hitch consisted of an L shaped commercially available hitch plate
bolted to the bumper under the license plate, which served to hold the
safety chains and had a slot for the drawbar to go through.  It also took
some or most of the tongue weight of the trailer (need some, but it isn't
much).  The real pulling came from an angle iron attached crosswise
under the bumper shocks with U bolts, which had a big solid piece of flat
stock welded to it and curved so it reached down sort of along the curve
of the inside of the valance, ending in a horizontal bend at the bottom.  At
that bend a modified commercial drawbar was bolted to this piece, and
then bent up and then back so it emerged through the L shaped piece
and had the ball on it.  I'd take the drawbar off at the track while I was
putting the megaphones on (guess you can't do that at Lime Rock).  I
think this setup might be tight for a stock muffler, which seems to eat up
most of the space behind the valance.

Guy I got the design from used to pull a Boston Whaler with a Hobie Cat
on top over the Divide, no problems.  A fellow I know with a 944 used to
just bolt his hitch directly to the rear bumper and tow a little rig like mine. 
Maybe 944 bumpers are stouter than ours, though.

I don't know what this U-Haul hitch looks like, but I think any hitch is going
to have to take some support from the bumper, and that is going to mean
drilling some holes.  With luck, hidden behind license plate.

3 Porsches combined might fetch, and wondering if something is wrong
with this picture)
