I am having an intermittent problem with my '68 911 which drains down my
battery power, and I suspect the ignition switch. I have installed a
battery disconnect which I use whenever the car won't be driven for a
week or more, and when I reinstall it (it has a by-pass to keep my CD
player memory settings and clok accurate), it starts fine. However, when
the car sits for just two or three days with the battery fully
operational, I sometimes, but, frustratingly, not all the time, do not
have enough battery power to start the car. I just get the clicking
solenoid sound, and have to hook up my battery charger to get a start.
Once it has run for awhile, it restarts just fine. Sometimes, I get the
solenoid clicking for 15-20 seconds, then the starter kicks in.

Anybody have any suggestions as to what the likely problem is? A friend
suggested the ignition short, which is common when a lot of extra weight
is put on the keychain, as the PO did (he was a plumber whose keychain
looked like it could unlock every residence in Denver).

Thanks,
Luther
