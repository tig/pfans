Synthetic, 5.0, is not a good choice for P-cars really. It may not 
lubricate ABS components and such like, you have to flush all other
non-DOT-5 fluids out as they are non miscible, true it doesn't take
up water - it instead keeps it in pools which can cause corrosion and
a tendency for these to be around the calliper area (bad).

o If you want something better than DOT3, try a DOT4 or DOT5.1 (like 
  Motul 5.1 or Motul 600). Aim for a branded bottle with foil seal.
o Castrol do a good DOT4 fluid (below the racing 45$US/litre LMA), and
  indeed NSX etc people use a Ford HD Brake fluid which was designed
  for a dumb truck which had brake lines too close to the exhaust.
  It's supposedly like the top Castrol but vastly reduced in price.
  Ford P-# C6AZ 19542A I believe, hard to find in the UK (wrong p-#).

A good DOT4 even would be fine for that racing application, just 
always use a fresh bottle of it, flush/change/bleed regularly.
