Hi,

Having only had this 88 Cab. for 2 months, I am discovering stuff everyday and
Porschefans has been extremely helpful.  I have two questions that I hope
someone can help me with.

1.  When I start the car cold I get a lot of white smoke from the exhaust for
about 1-2 minutes.  The smoke is definately not blue.  Is this normal, is it
some sort of condensation?

2.  The car seems to move slowly to the right if I take my hand off the wheel.
The steering wheel is also very slightly skewed to the right.  I had the tires
aligned at Wheel Works, but there does not seem to be any change.  Should I
have them do it again or could it be something else.  The brakes do not appear
to be pulling.

Thanks for the help.
