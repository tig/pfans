I had a similar noise at lower pulls on my C4..  i could hear an intermitt.
grating noise from the rear only under high stress loads at low rpm's//
after trips and trips to mechanics (one said that my cat was broken and i
needed a new one) i took the exaust off  and it was a heat shield on the
cat. there are  3 shields with about 20 connections and one of the
braze-ons had snapped off.. i bought a "test pipe" from B&B which
eliminated the cat and the heat shields and  she purrs like a kitten.....
