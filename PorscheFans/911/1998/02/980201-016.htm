Hello PFans,

I installed a B&B complete exhaust system (headers and twin outlet 
muffler) on my 1980 SC just over a year ago and would like to share my 
experiences with you.
The stainless steel construction of the B&B system is excellent and very 
easy to install. There is also a noticeable improvement in the torque 
which is great for city driving. The sound produced is deep and 
purposeful.. enough to make Mustang and Camaro owners smile and pull 
over. However, there are a few things to watch for:
1) The 'touring' muffler' produces some resonance between 2000 and 3000 
rpm. The muffler was returned to B&B and the resonance did improve 
somewhat. This resonance did not bother my wife so I guess it's a 
personal thing. 
2) the Oil-tank 'S' hose provided with the B&B kit consists of a metal 
hose with a rubber hose and clamps at each end. The fit of this is a bit 
sloppy and you need to be VERY VERY careful that the hose and clamps are 
securely installed or else guess what.. NO OIL-->NO ENGINE!!!
3)The right exhaust header pipe is, in my opinion, routed way too close 
to the oil tank 'S' hose. As a matter of fact, the header almost touches 
the rubber hose which could eventually deteoriate and crack causing oil 
loss. To prevent this from happening, I flattened the header with a 
rubber mallet to create a 1/8in gap. This does not cause damage to the 
header in any way.
4) The gaskets provided by B&B crack and cause leaks. I have already 
replaced these with the original metal Porsche gaskets which are far 
superior.  

Due to Canadian emissions regulations which will be in effect later this 
year, I need to revert to my old catalytic converter system. Reluctantly 
therefore, I am willing to part with the complete B&B system for $1500 
USD (purchaser pays shipping etc.). 
 I may be reached via email at aascom@hotmail.com
