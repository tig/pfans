Ok, here's a not-so-hypothetical question ;^)

First, the details...

Car is a '90 C2 coupe, with 16" wheels. Currently needs tires.
Suspension,
etc, is stock.

I have X amount of money to spend on handling/looks upgrades.
EVENTUALLY
(over the course of a couple of years) I'd like to end up with the
car lowered a bit, stiffer (especially roll stiffness, dive, squat), and
running on 17" wheels & tires.

Ross:

I have a '90 C2 Cab, and I've done all of the things you're contemplating. 
Here is the order in which I'd spend my money, primarily from a
performance standpoint, secondarily from a looks standpoint.  In my
case, though, purchase order wasn't an issue, since I did them all at the
same time upon buying the car used (with only 8800 miles on it!) in 1996. 
As far as usage, I don't race the car, but it sees at least 2 track days a
year because I put on two driver instructional events each year at
Willow Springs and Buttonwillow raceways.  I'm what anyone would
consider an extremely aggressive driver, street and track, so
performance is critical for me.

1) Tires - whatever wheels you have, tires are one of the most critical
(and cheapest)  differences you can make w.r.t handling.  I don't want to
start another long thread on the merits/demerits of running R rated race
tires on the street, but I've run BFG R1's or Yokohama 008 RS's on my
street cars for the last 12 years, and have never had a problem.  If you
don't want to go the R rated route (great alliteration, huh?! :-)), then get a
really good "street" tire, like a Dunlop SP 8000, Bridgestone S02 ($300
per tire - ouch!) or the like.

2) Weltmeister adjustable (and larger than stock) anti-sway bars front
and rear - in stock form, with all due respect to Porsche, the car rolls like
a pig.  These bars make a huge difference.  I'd recommend Charlie Bars
(from Charlie Spira, long time POC member and racer), and I'd have
gotten them myself, but my understanding is that he doesn't make bars
for 964's.

3) H & R Springs - the ones I got are only slightly stiffer than stock and
have fairly similar compression and decompression rates, I'm told, but
they work better, and perhaps more importantly, lower the car
substantially - about 1 and 1/2 inches in the front and 3/4 inch in the
back.  This lowers the center of gravity, and provides a nice rake to the
car, making it look really great.  Sloped driveways are not a big problem,
but should not be ignored.

4) 17" 993 wheels - I don't feel this is a huge performance advantage,
but they sure look great!  I got mine chromed, and it really makes a huge
difference in the appearance of the car.

5) Shocks - I haven't changed mine, because I haven't really felt the need
to do so.  But I'd imagine that you could do a bit better if you wanted, at
fairly substantial cost.

5) 993 mirrors - if you have some money left over that you just don't
know what to do with, update your ugly, rectangular mirrors with the
nice, curved 993 mirrors, which are the same as the mirrors that wound
up on later 964 C2's and C4's.  I like mine, but can't say the aerodynamic
advantage is particularly noticeable!

Let us know what you decide to do, and good luck.  If you're in the L.A.
area, I'd suggest you let Steve Alarcon at Johnson't Alignment do your
work - he's the best (no disprespect intended to other suspension guys
in L.A. who are on Pfans, but my experience with Steve over the last 12
years has been great).
