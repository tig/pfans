     IN MY '73 911, AFTER REPLACING THE REAR SHOCKS, MY RIDE HEIGHT CHANGED 
     SUBSTANTIALLY.  THE SHOCKS I TOOK OUT WERE KYB GAS CHARGED (REALLY 
     STIFF) AND THE REPLACEMENTS WERE KONI STANDARD HYDRAULIC (NOT GAS 
     CHARGED).  
     
     WHEN I RESET THE REAR SPRING PLATE ON THE TORSION BAR, I HAD TO MOVE 
     ONE FULL TOOTH TO RAISE THE REAR UP TO THE SUGGESTED 25 INCH FENDER 
     LIP MEASUREMENT, WHICH IS WHAT THE CAR HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SET AT.  
     WITH THE SWING ARM UNATTACHED FROM THE BANANA ARM, THE SWING ARM SAT 
     AT ABOUT 7:30 ON A CLOCK SCALE, AND THERE WAS A LOT OF PRELOAD IN 
     ORDER TO ATTACH THE SWING ARM TO THE BANANA ARM - TOO MUCH FOR ME TO 
     CONSIDER IT SAFE TO DO SO.
     
     I'M CONSIDERING UPGRADING THE TORSION BARS FROM THE STOCK TO 27MM TO 
     OVERCOME THIS, BUT I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE HAD INPUT AS TO ANOTHER 
     PROBLEM THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR BEFORE I PURCHASE THE TORSION 
     BARS?
     
     THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
