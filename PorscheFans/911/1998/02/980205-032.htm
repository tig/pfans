The following has been forwarded to 911@PorscheFans.com+++++

From:  Josh Hadler <jhadler@rmi.net>
     To:  914 <914@porschefans.com>

Hi all,

This is for a friend who is not on the list. And could someone please
forward this onto the 911 list.

The car is located in the SF bay area in California.

---
1969 911E, still running mechanical fuel injection, upgraded carrera
tensioners, 125K total miles, ~3K on rebuilt engine, ~16K on rebuilt
transmission.

Body in good shape (cream colored),reletively new tires. Needs some
tweeking on the fuel injection, but the engine is strong. I'm looking
for ~$8500, but willing to  negotiate for a good home.
---

I know the car, and the owner, and can attest that it has been treated
very well for the 6 years that he's owned it. He would very much want to
sell it to someone who will make the effort to keep the car original.
Including keeping the MFI with the car.

Contact Dave at (650)321-2967

Thanks,

-Josh2
