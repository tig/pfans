Folks,

I had to read this one three times before I could really believe what this
guy was saying.

It is also completey dangerous and stupid to drive at over 140MPH on U.S.
highways. This type of activity gives Porsche owners a bad rap. Show some
intelligence....get you speed fix at a local PCA track event....
