Perry,

The Northeast PCA has an excellent web site that includes an article
targeted right at first time driver's ed participants (myself included).

The article "So I signed up for my first driver's ed event-Now what!?"
by Bill Hawe is excellent:   http://www.porschenet.com/norest19.html
It should answer most if not all of your questions.

The Northeast PCA site at:  http://www.PorscheNet.com/  also has a ton
of excellent general info regarding driver's ed classes.

Have fun,

Vinny Guercio
Ft. Salonga, NY

>I attended my first driver ed event last year and I'm planning to
attend

I'm
>interested to know what other people bring to the track for these
events (i.e.
>tools, parts, comfort items, etc.).  Advice from experienced "track
people"
>welcome.
