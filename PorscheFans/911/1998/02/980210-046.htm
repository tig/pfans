I'm looking to purchase an 85 Targa.  Seems like the car may have been raced.
Why you ask?  Well, competition tires, customer wheel, what appears to be a
short throw gear shift....  but the car runs fine, except for one thing.  

The "throw" is different between gears 1,2,3,4,5 let me explain

Imagine that from the "neutral" postion, the throw to 1st is three inches.  or
whatever it is.  While 2/4/R appear to be the full throw, 1/3/5 are different.
1st appears to be the full throw (3"), but 3rd is less, say 2", and 5th less
still 1".  Is this  "normal" for some type of transmission/linkage, or do I
have a potential problem.

The drawing is my best attempt.  the "." indicates the length of throw per
gear.

   1  3  5
