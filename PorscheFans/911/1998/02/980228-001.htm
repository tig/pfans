<pre>
after a 6 month hiatus from AOL, i now have a new PC, and can get back into
PorscheFans.  I did some work on my 77 targa over the winter that others may
be interested in:  
- rebuilt front suspension with new poly bushings.
-rebuilding drivers bucket.  PO was pretty heavy, and broke lower cushion side
frames, and demolished seat back bolsters.  I had to make up new side rails
from rod stock, and rebuild bolsters with foam and duct tape.  Now I know how
those guys who make Madonna's costumes feel!  

A comment on two threads that were running recently.  Yes, dry chem fire
extinguishers (BC, ABC chem) is very nasty to aluminum and magnesium.  this is
why they are not allowed near aircraft, even for the ground support vehicles
at an airport.  these vehicles use purple K, suitable for soft metals.  you
could also get a halon extinguisher, or a halon alternative.

on targa tops, i had dan pechtel inspect my top and quote a price.  $725
seemed quite high, but dan does seem very knowledgable and professional.
still, if you can't afford it, sounds like a possible DIY.

Glad to see the list has expanded to almost 2000 members since last summer!
