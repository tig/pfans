> I was crawling under my 911T this weekend to check out my brake lines
> and saw  various numbers attached to my gearbox and engine. I was
> wondering if someone could help me decipher them?
> 
> On the engine: attached to a strut on the fan the number 619 1167,
> just behind it on the oil pressure thing was written 901/03 and next
> to it 20919. Then I also found the part number 901.101.101.2R
> 
> On the side of the gearbox part number 901.301.101.0R and next to it
> in a circle 37/67.
> underneath the gearbox, on the join the following three numbers.
> 1281632
> 902/02
> 23060108
> 
> Can anyone tell me what they mean?
> 
> Also what is the part number for the rubber brake lines I could only
> see part of the number on the line itself, the rubber was marked ATE,
> while the metal fitting was marked Lockheed, with D2403 something
> 4646.
