P-Fans,

I have purchased and installed the Speedbleeders on my 79 SC. After reading the great 
despcription of the "self-leveling" method (hang hoses vertically from bleeder screws, 
fill fluid periodically, thought I'd try it with the speed bleeders.

It work fantastically!  I did both rears first, then both fronts.  On the rears, I 
actually filled the hoses twice, closing off the screw in between and emptying.  
Basically, I just let the system do its thing while changing tranny fluid and doing 
other maintenence; each end sat for about an hour.  The brake pedal feel is noticeably 
improved over my previous "pump-bleeding".

Don't know if the speed-bleeders or the methodology caused the improvement, but they 
certainlyy didn't hurt!
