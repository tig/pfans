Hi again,

I'm learning a lot from this list - Thanks to everyone so far!

As a recent 88 Carerra Cab owner; I am looking forward to the end of the
40 days/40 Nights of rain in the Bay Area - I am suffering from "I
haven't had the top down in weeks"...

Before I go on about my idle problem I would appreciate a recommendation
for a versatile mechanic in the Burlingame area (reasonable) :) ...

I am going to try again with this little problem which is really
annoying me.  I submitted the following message last week:

Starting my 911 cold results in a smooth idle for a couple of minutes. 
As the engine warms, the idle starts to get rough so that once the idle
slows to approx. 900 RPM it is rougher than anyone would deem
acceptable. 

The car idles smooth for 2 or 3 seconds and then stumbles a little (1 or
2 secs) before idling OK for a few more seconds ... and then etc.  It is
not erratic enough to be visible on the Tach or to stall out or anything
like that - I just want it to purr like it's supposed to!  I would
really appreciate any thoughts, any ideas?

I received a couple of replies and it was suggested that I clean the
idle control valve (no luck) and check all electronic sensor connections
(no luck).  It was also mentioned that the temp. sensor may be the
culprit. I searched & located the following data from the list:  

> Here are the resistance values from the shop manual for the head temp.
> sensor (911 Carrera):
> 
>         32 deg F        4.4 to 6.8 k-ohms
>         59 - 86 deg F   1.4 to 3.6 k-ohms       
>         104 deg F       1.0 to 1.3 k-ohms
>         176 deg F       250 to 390 ohms
>         212 deg F       160 to 210 ohms
>         265 deg F       90 ohms

What do I do with these?  How do you reference surface temp./impedance?
Where is the damn thing?  Any other ideas about the idle situation- Am I
missing the boat here?

Thanks again in advance, it's appreciated!

Chris
