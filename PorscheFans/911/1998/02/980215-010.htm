Hello P Folks;

My 73 911T has recently started (more than before) dripping oil.   I
power washed the engine, then drove the car for 30 minutes.  I pulled
the rear tires and noticed the lines to & from the oil tank were really
covered with oil.  Are these lines known to go bad?

In addition, I was pricing new oil lines in Automation and noticed they
sold "Easy-to-install oil return lines".  They are suppose to eliminate
a lot of work pulling the engine or exhaust to fix oil leaks.   Has
anyone tried these "expandable return tubes"?

I'm also having a problem with the driver-side door handle.  The door
appears to be in correct alignment and hinge appears to be fine.
However, when the exterior handle is squeezed, the door doesn't seem to
"pop" open.  Sometimes, if I keep trying, the door will open on the 8th
try or so.  Any suggestions before I spend $200+ on a new door
handle.......
