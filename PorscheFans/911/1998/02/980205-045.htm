 huh? I have a lot of practice. It seems mine breaks about every 6 months.
 I have thought about making a ball pin out of Titanium but I don't know
 enough about the characteristics of Ti to know if it would work. My
 suspicion is that the T/O fork gets some amount of wear and accelerates
 the breakage of the pin. When I have the motor out next time I am going to
 replace the T/O fork.
 
 Let me know waht you find out.    Later, Chris

Order 911.423.212.90 from Automotion.  It won't fail, because there is no way
the ears can break.  Look in their current catalog at page 153.
