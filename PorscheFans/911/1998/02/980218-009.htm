As a big 964 fan, due to its refinements and performance, there is one
difference in the 964 that might be considered a disadvantage over the
Carrera.  When Porsche went from the Carrera to the 964 they progressed from
more hand assembled bodies to a modern production line.  Apparently this
resulted in significant increases in the problems with rebuilding wrecks as I
remember reading that the bodies are harder to straighten and that rebodying
rather than repair became much more common, at least in Europe.  Perhaps Bruce
Anderson could comment on this?  

Since none of us intend to wreck our vehicles, I guess the point is that some
of the character may have been lost with the change to the 964.  On second
though, isn't that what fans of the older style Porsches say every time a new
model Porsche is introduced?  I'm keeping my C2.
