They are in Portland Or. I visised the place and it's kind of a museam for
salt-flat drag racing...
they have some interesting products though.. they sell a molibium coating
that resists build up of any sort..(good for salt flat racing) works pretty
well (I'm an industrial designer and I spec'ed some for a ski binding to
resist snow clog.. -good for finland  ;-) they have some coatings that
crate a thermal barrier and keep heat in.. good for exaust flow.. they have
coatings which aid in the cooling of metals... good for heads..(i think)
never had much exp. with the home products though.. one guy there is
rebuilding a 356 with an electronic racing ignition and lots of other
goodies...
