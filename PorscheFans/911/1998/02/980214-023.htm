Has anyone had experience with Rennsport in Roswell, GA for wheel refinishing?

I just had 4 Fuchs wheels for a '86 Carerra refinished by Rennsport.  The
rims were polished and the centers repainted semi-gloss black.  The inside
of the wheel was painted satin black.  They did a good job.  Protected the
rims with tape to prevent damage during shipping and mounting.  The rims
were NOT clear coated.  They told me that this would cause problems later
in maintaining the appearance of the rim.  Cost was $110/wheel + $12/wheel
for shipping.

Unlike some of the other refinishers, Rennsport will not anodize the rims.
Though I like the factory anodized matt look, the finish of my wheels
looked quite cloudy and uneven and there was nothing I could do about it.
(I tried the vaseline treatment and varies other methods recommended by
this list without success).  I believe that the polished rims can be
maintained better in the long run with car wax and polish.

If you desire concourse conditions, however, you should probably anodize.
