Greg purchased a replacement seatbelt for his SC, but the retractor
won't work.  I've never purchased a replacement, so I am guessing that
the replacement comes with a new reel, which is the guts of the system
- the thing which allows you to pull the belt around yourself, but locks
when you crash into something.

If this is so, maybe the reason he can't get it to work (before installing) is
because it is not an inertial reel like helicopters have - something which
can be pulled out if you pull slowly, but locks up if you pull it fast.  Instead
it is (or at least the one on my 77 is) based on a pendulum of sorts. 
When you stop fast, the pendulum swings forward and locks.  Or, when
you stop fast the nose dips, and the pendulum lines up differently, and
locks.  In any case, only when the reel housing is vertical will it allow you
to unwind it.  Or so I thought I found out when I removed mine.  I had the
car jacked up very high in the rear when I put it back in, and it wouldn't
unwind.  If I unbolted it and held it vertical, it worked.  When I lowered the
car so it was vertical when bolted on, it worked.

I always figured this was why the old "pull it out fast to see if it locks and
is working" doesn't necessarily work on all seat belts.  But it works on
lots of them, since that's what we all do teching cars for driver's ed.  So I
don't know which years used what systems.  The reel assembly doesn't
invite taking it apart for inspection, as I recall.

Hope this is how yours works and all is well.
