Basically a fiberglass-packed megaphone with discs stacked at the outlet.

>2. What is the effect of the discs?

By adding or subtracting the number of discs, the amount of exhaust backpressure
can be changed.  More discs means more flow area and less backpressure and vice
versa.  More discs also means more noise and vice versa.

Well, street legal is kinda doubtful on a 911.  I have seen Supertrapps on
big American V8s and they're pretty quiet, but the ones on my 911 are loud.
I'm sure they're much louder than a Bursch exhaust.  I've set off car alarms
with mine on more than one occasion...  Having said that, though, I love
the sound of the things - even most of my non-carguy friends at work
think they sound great.

>4. Supplier/pricing?

Most of the racing products suppliers carry them.  They're around $85 - $140
each depending on the size and whether you want stainless steel or not.
