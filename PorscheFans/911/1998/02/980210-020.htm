Re: 993 Radio replacement
Date: 2/11/98

My 993 Radio/CD began eating CD's - literally rubbing the head into the CD's and scratching them.
The local dealer didn't even bother listening to it, took my word, and ordered a new unit to be replaced 
under warranty. Kudos to them.

That was almost three months ago! 

It turns out that Porsche does not replace warranty sound units with new units but with
refurbished units. Unfortunately there is a shortage of refurbished units and therefore I am
on back order.

Porsche NA get it together. My 96' C4 Cab cost $85k - I want my CD player and I want it now!!!

Your dealer should replace the unit no questions asked. However, be prepared for some serious
waiting. On the other hand, if this is going to cost you more than a cup of coffee while you wait 
during installation of your "refurbished" unit, get rid of that piece of $!@# Becker and get a
real car stereo installed.

Regards.
