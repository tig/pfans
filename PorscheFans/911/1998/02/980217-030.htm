I have a friend with a 90 C2 and is having problems with a chip that he
installed.
He was wondering if anyone has had experience with chips in a C2.  Im not sure
of the make of the chip. His problems are as follows.  1.  The rev limiter is
the same as it was when stock.  2. There are 2 flat spots in the power curve
one at around 4000 and one at around 6000.  by flat spots I mean a hesitation
during accelleration.  3. In the cold weather Starting is a problem and when
it starts it idles very rough.  

Thanks in advance
