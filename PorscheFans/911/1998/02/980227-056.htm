Hello everyone,
 I currently own a 1978 911SC (grey market) car. I am interested in rebuilding
the motor and would like to know what would be the best route to go. My
interest is to increase the horsepower, however still maintain its
driveability.  I was thinking 250HP would be a good target to be competitive
in todays market. What would be the best setup? Or would you switch to a 3.2
motor out of a 1984-1987? I really don't know what to do with the motor and
the injection systems. Or would you use webbers?  Any help would be
appreciated, Thanks.
.
