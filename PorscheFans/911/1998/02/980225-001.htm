Okay, so I moved out of the country thinking I would be gone for at least a
year and, as a result, I sold my C2 before I left!   Now its less than 6
months later and it looks like I'll be returning much sooner than I had
anticipated.   I'm in no big hurry, but I know it won't be long after I get
back in the States before I get the itch to get back into another 911.   I
thought I'd put my feelers out now to see what's out there.

I'm trying to stay in the '91 - '93 C2 range.   I would consider a C4 or a
Cab but my preference is another C2 Coupe.   The main criteria is a very
clean car with reasonable mileage.  No dents/scratches.  No fixed-up
wrecks.  The interior needs to be very close to perfect.

This will be C2 number 3 for me, so I know what to expect as far as bang
for the buck goes.

If you have something you think I might be interested in on the market, let
me know.  If you know of somebody else with such a creature, I would really
appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.   Feel free to
pass around my e-mail address or post this in other places where it might
get a response.

Thanks,
Eric
Two-time C2 owner, looking for number three.
