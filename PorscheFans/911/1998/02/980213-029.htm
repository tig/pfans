Hey,
I listened to the noise with a stethescope and it seems to be coming
from the timing chain housing on the left side. I suppose from what I've
read thats a tensioner getting ready to go. So here come the questions.
1)What style should I use?
     a.original
     b.hydraulic
     c.mechanical
2)Should I replace the chains while I'm in there? The engine was just
rebuilt top to bottom by p.o.
3)If I should do I have to split engine case to get chains out?
4)Is changing tensioners something which can be done with engine in car?
I had said earlier that the tensioners were replaced with brand new
mechanical ones prior to sale. I was mistaken, they were original
tensioners for a '75 911.
  Thanks in advance.

'75 911S

later,
 Shawn
