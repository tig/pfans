 The saga on my 77 911S Targa Sportomatic continues.  The dealer has had the
car since the end of October.  They say they have fixed the shifting problem
(won't come out of gear at low rpms).  However, it only works after warm up.
So backing out of the garage requires stopping in the street, shutting off the
engine momentarily at which time the transmission immediately releases and I
can shift into first gear and restart the engine.  
 
 When I am on the road, if I down shift into 1st at about 1,000 rpm before a
stop, everything works fine.  This was before they fixed the vacumn leak on
#5.   I have not driven the car since I took it to the deaker.  
 
 The estimate so far is $1,600.  The vacumn control valve -- Bosch part -- was
replaced but the problem was worse so they put the original part back in.  
 As I said, supposedly the car now shifts fine when warmed up.  Two weeks ago
they were looking at why the car didn't idle at 950 during cold start.  If
this can be fixed, maybe it will finally get to come home.   
 
 Any sugestions would be helpfull on the shifting problem or idle speed
problem.
