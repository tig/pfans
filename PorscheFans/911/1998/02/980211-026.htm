I can check tonight - IF the weights are listed in '911 Forever Young' for
both. I know there's a weight for the 3.2, and I *think* there is one for
the 2.7 as well.

My recollection after poking through again last night (looking for gearbox
weights) is:

3.6 - 238kg (524 lbs)
3.2 - 219kg (481 lbs)
3.0 - 200kg (440 lbs)

I DIDN'T look any farther back than that. You can extrapolate if you want and
whack off another 40 lbs or so, but bet on the 2.7 being at least 40 or 50 lbs
lighter than the 3.2. I'll look tonight if I remember.

I looked again for gearbox weights last night - unfortunately 'Forever Young'
only lists the G50 and late 915s (back to '84 or '85). I don't know when
the 915 changed from a mag case to aluminum, but all the 915s listed were
60 kg... WITH oil.

Steve Weiner kindly (and to the detriment of his back) weighed some that
he had kicking around in the shop, found a mag case 915 weighing in at
88 lbs, and a G50 at about 160 lbs. He didn't say whether the 915 was pumped
full of helium ;^)

Cheers,

Ross
