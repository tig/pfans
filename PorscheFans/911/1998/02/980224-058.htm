Here's another one:

A young stud in a Porsche 911 turbo stops at a traffic light, 
and a very old man riding a moped pulls up next to him at the
light.

The old man leans over sticks his head into the passenger
window and says "Hey Sonny, what kind of new fangled sports
car is this?"

The young stud happily replies, "Why this is the Porsche 911
turbo the fastest production car on the planet, this baby will
do 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds!  What do you think about that you
old fart!"

The old man replies "Well my moped is pretty fast!"  The light
turns green and the young stud decides to show this old guy
what his car will do.  He pops the clutch and nails the throttle
and like a shot he is gone.  He looks in the rearview mirror and
sees a look of horror on the old mans face and the old fart has his 
fists in the air yelling something.  Probably upset at the young
studs sudden jack rabbit start.  He looks again in his rearview mirror 
and sees something gaining on him fast.  He thinks to himself
what in the heck could be catching up to me?

Suddenly the object not only catches him but passes him at
a rapid rate of speed.  "Holy crap what the heck just blew my
doors off", the young stud screams out loud.  Then in the distance
he sees another object coming right towards him also at an
incredible rate of speed.  BOOOOOOMM, CRAAAAASH,
BAAANGGG.  The object plows into the young studs Porsche
and the car is totalled.  

The young stud pulls himself from the wreckage and finds what 
appears to be left of the old man and the moped he had met at
the stop light.  The old man with his last breath says to the young
stud, "Before you tore off from that stop light I was trying to tell
you that my darn suspenders where caught on your side view
mirror Sonny!!!!"
