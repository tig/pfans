This sounds about right.  After I installed mine, I saw approximately
3-4 mm distance.  Some clearance is necessary to provide 
for expansion/contraction of the engine and tubes.

I just recently replaced my original tubes with collapsable tubes to
cure a very minor oil leak.  I asked around before I made my choice,
and two reputable shops in my area both recommended a brand called
Competitor.  These are aluminum alloy tubes, with silicon O-rings. 
Both shops said that they had better luck with these working than with
the factory collapsable tubes.  

I called several places before purchasing.  The gentleman I talked to
at Zim's gave me the same story as my two trusted PCA member wrenches.
 He said he would love to sell me the higher priced (double) factory
kit but that his shop's experience was that the Competitor tubes
worked best.  I think they ran $15 apiece vs. $30 each for the factory
tubes.  The other companies didn't get my business because they tried
to convince me that the factory parts were twice ($$) as good.

I am very pleased with these tubes.  They look well crafted and as an
added bonus, the kit lists the part numbers for replacement o-rings,
as well as a reasonably priced source.  So far, no leaks, and they
look much better than the factory tubes.  They don't use a snap ring
between the tubes.  The smaller diameter tube has an v-notch machined
into it, and a Viton o-ring is provided that fits into this, to
prevent the tubes from collapsing.  It is a much more elegant
solution, IMHO.  Overall, I'm happy with 'em.

Good Luck,
