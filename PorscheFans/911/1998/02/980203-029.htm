Hello PorscheFans,

I recently bought a late 1990 C4 and traded in my 1985 Carrera 3.2. 
First of all I would like to thank all of you who have given me 
buyer's advise when I requested this on the mailinglist. I have
certainly used it !.

The car is quite different compared to my previous 911 but it's great
though !!

I have a couple of questions :

Today was a good day to test the 4-wheel-drive. Roads were covered
with ice, but grip was much better than with the Carrera 3.2. However I 
was wondering if there should not be a 'warning' light blinking under
these conditions indicating that one or more wheels looses grip and that 
power is adjusted on all wheels automatically ?

Also I have noticed that the rear spoiler can move a little (couple
of mm's). When the spoiler is down, the paint gets a little damaged,
when its up, its noisy and clanky on rough roads. Is this normal or 
can it be fixed with new bearings of some sort ?

Does anyone have any ideas on where to mount the inner part a stinger
(Bell in US) radar detector? On the center console its to easy to spot
by thieves and I don't want to give up the ashtray to provide space.

Also I've noticed that when driving the car the oil-temperature first
rises, to a certain point and after about 5 minutes, it drops a little.
Is this due to a oil coller/thermostat of some sort ?

Most of the 'early' C4/C2's I have seen (including mine) had moisture in
the taillights.
Is there a modification for this ?

These were the questions so far, I'm sure I will think of more in the
future.

Kind regards,
