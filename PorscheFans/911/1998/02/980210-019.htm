greetings...i just rekindled my love affair with a 911, buying a 78SC
last week after being 911-less for eight years. car ran fine all four
times i drove it before buying it, but now, it's doing a quirky thing at
idle. when i put the car in neutral at a stop, the engine drops to a
couple hundred rpm, then leaps to about 2300 rpm, then dives back to a
couple hundred rpm...it'll do this a couple times, until the rpm's drop
low enough that it stalls. here's the quirkier part: this morning, it
did this during about 20 minutes of driving, i stopped at the next light
and it idled perfectly at 900 rpm, then after 5-7 minutes of driving, it
was back to leaping all over the place at the next light, and 5 minutes
after that, it idled at about 1000 rpm, moving between that and 1100 rpm
before i pulled it into my parking spot in reverse and it stalled...i
don't see a pattern yet but anyone have a clue what this might be? i'm
quickly becoming a master of the handbrake/accelerator waltz, but am
tired of it already...thanks...
.
