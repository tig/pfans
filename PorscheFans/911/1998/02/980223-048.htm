Forget the rest, a car is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
As to actual value, well, I would say his idea of the car and everyone
elses will probably differ. For $60K you can get, oh yeah, here it is:

1997 Porsche 993C2, silver/cashmere leather, 7,900 miles, 6-spd, 17"
rims w/ Porsche crest, crest floor mats, Hi-Fi stereo w/ CD changer,
dual pwr. seats, motorsound package, one rock chip on the entire car.
Asking $63,000.


Now then, if Jay Leno is looking specifically to finish off his 1980 series
cars and *needs" an '87 in totally pristine condition with minimal miles
then I would say your Dad may have gotten lucky, but tell him not to hold
his breath.

Now, if it was an '87 Targa, that would be different...
