I need to tap the wisdom of the members of the 911 list, if I may.

The situation:

PO has a 1988 Porsche 911 Coupe, non turbo, guards red, five speed 220
hp with leather and alarm system.  Second owner with 75000 miles on the
odometer.  The machine has factory tail with a/c, p/s, p/w, and power
sun roof.  Exterior and interior appear very good to excellent.
Undercoating looks very good.  Engine compartment clean but some minor
oil in the valve cover area underneath.

I looked at the machine yesterday.  PO had the car parked on concrete
drive.  I did not see any indication of oil leaking on the concrete.  PO
will permit me to have the car checked out by a mechanic.

PO is asking $28,000 and change for the car.  I checked the various
lists on the internet and noted 1988s are listed from 21,000 to 27,500
for the coupe non turbo model.  The blue book retail for my zip code on
this model as equipped is $27,300.

Questions:
    1.  Are there any particular things to watch out for in the 1988
model?
    2.  What would be a good offer for this machine?
    3.  Reliability  of the 1988 model year?

Thanks in advance.
