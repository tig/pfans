Bob,
The only turbo cars that were made in 74/75 were for racing purposes
only.  They were never sold to the public or put on the street.  The
model designations were 934 (group 4 ~ 1975-1976) & 935 (group 6 ~
1976).  Turbo Spyders were group 7 in 1976 and were designated 936's.

Usually that's the case, but not with the 930.  The tranny was around
beforethe car.
