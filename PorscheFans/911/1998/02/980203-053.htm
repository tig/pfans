Michael Rothenberg has starting problems on his 82 SC, and asks some
questions.

What about the lighter aftermarket starters?  I bought one from Gene
Berg 5 years ago for my race car.  Berg carries them for Vws, but work
fine on 911s.  I see that these are now being advertised in the $175
range in our Porsche publications, down from Tilton's price.  This is a
geared reduction unit, and has worked flawlessly for me.  Of course,
that's not my daily driver.

If the whine is actually from your starter (and not from the CD box), then
something is amiss in the solenoid, which not only acts like a relay
switching the heavy starter current, but also levers the starter spur gear
back so it engages the flywheel ring gear (I think - never disassembled
one).  The whine could be the starter turning under no load.  Don't know
just what the medium speed clicking would be.

Checking voltages at the starter not a bad idea.  Starter only held on with
two bolts/nuts, plus one bolt on wire and two push ons (battery
disconnected, please).  Not really that hard to get at to remove with
engine/tranny in car (note I didn't say it was easy, but easier than having
to pull the whole power train).  You can do it.

Auto electric shops can often fix these things.  When you get yours out
(if it wasn't a bad electrical connection problem) you can probably put
12V to it and see if the starter gear moves out like it should as it spins.

With your starter out you may be able, using mirrors, to inspect your ring
gear also, just to see if you have some big gaps of missing teeth.  One
doesn't hear of this, but if the starter behaves well on the test bench,
that's a thing to look for.

This summer one of our fellows from Texas found that his starting
problems were due to the starter cable being loose in its socket at the
battery!  But it is hot weather that seems to bring out these problems.
