Thanks for the update on the bolt-on sway bar mount. It appears the transition
period was the introduction of the SC models.

Sherwood

PS. If I'm not incorrect, didn't the factory introduce the SC model in 1978?
Then perhaps the factory began to phase in the bolt-on mount alloy arm during
the '77 model year. 

On 2/5 you replied:
<<I just checked with a guy that had a '77 911S. It came from the factory

with the bolt-on sway bar mount. I asked another person that has built

quite a few track cars over the years. Most of the '77 cars he saw also

had the bolt-on sway bar mount. All the 911SC's he has ever seen have the

bolt-on sway bar mount.



It would appear that Porsche introduced them sometime during the '77 model

year production run.
