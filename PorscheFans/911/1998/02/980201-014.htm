Chris,

This seems similar to a problem I had.  My dash lights would
occassionally brighten for a moment, then dim back to normal.
In my case, it was a failing voltage regulator.  If this is
your problem, I suggest you check it SOON.  It's a very
destructive problem.

The alternator creates about 16 volt potential.  The VR
restricts the charging voltage to around 14V.  At 16V, several
things happen.  Bulbs start to burn out, relays start to fail,
squirrel cage fans start to fry (heater/AC/vent), the battery
will overcharge and boil, and wiring harness connections will
be stressed.  Believe me on these points :-(

I'm not sure where your VR is located.  Mine was mounted on the
back of the alternator.  If you had a shop replace your alternator,
I would expect that they would have replaced your VR also.  If
you DIY'd it, the new/rebuilt alternator should have had a new
one.  Either way, you may want to pursue a warrantee issue.

Anyway, although the brighter dash lights are a bonus, a failed
VR is a very bad thing.  YMMV.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne Michelsen
