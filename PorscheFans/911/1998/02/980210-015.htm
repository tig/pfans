Peter.Demeester in Belgium queries the list re buying a late
Carrera:

Don't worry about this.  911 and "climate control" is almost an oxymoron
anyway.  The A/C does not work that well.  Most people who feel they can
survive without it are happy without it.  I took mine out, but probably
would have left it in if it worked better.

Jeeze.  This makes me wonder if a 911 is for you.  This is a level of
granularity re: creature comforts that is out of the domain of most
911 enthusiasts.  Worring if the sunroof might leak is like wondering
if your brakes may eventually need replacing.  A targa is another
story since there is a lot more "seal surface area" to worry about and
perpetual leaking seems to be standard equipment.  The issue of noise
is relative also since a 911 is anything but quiet and refined on
any front.

For a 911 enthusiast this is a dream scenario.  The PO has graciously done
for you what you would most likely want in about 1 year anyway :)
Most people agonize over how to justify the cost of really cool
but essentially unneccessary mods.  Unless you are a purist or someone
who never plans to learn to use the car's performance capabilities
this is the setup you want.  And, you are getting it at essentially no
cost since the car appears to be priced reasonably.

Forget how cool it looks.  Just do this:  Buy the car and get used to
for a while.  Then find a stock one and drive it.  The warm smug feeling
you get will last a long time!  The fact that it looks cool is a happy
coincidence.

This car sounds like a great deal as long as it checks out mechanically.
Make sure you know it's oil consumption habits or if the valve guides
have been fixed.

Good luck and let us know if you buy it!
