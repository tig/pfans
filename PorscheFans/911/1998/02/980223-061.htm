Larry - while I obviously was mistaken about how far back the push on
knobs went, I thought I qualified my post not to include recent cars (your
'98 being really recent, you lucky dog) with which I have scant
experience (a guy let me drive his 993 on the track once, and I have
instructed people in them, but wasn't paying much attention to shift
knobs).  

Folks on the list occasionally post info about later cars saying you pry a
cap off to access a screw or the like which holds the knob on.  I have
assumed what you could pry off was something like the shift pattern
logo which could cleverly hide a circular seam.  Makes sense, but I have
no personal experience, and for all I really know they went back to a
screw on knob.  But I'd hunt around for something which could cover
some sort of fastener but could be pried off.  If your new knob is actually
compatible wouldn't inspection of it reveal its secret?

With luck one of the owners who has replaced his 993 or C2 knob will let
you know. 

Sorry if I caused any confusion. 

Walt
