I posted this question last week.  I got one response, but unfortunately it
was deleted.  I thought that I could try it again.  I have an 88 Cab.  Is it
normal that the rear brake rotors are extremely hot to the touch after
driving.  Most of my driving is stop and go city driving, but I noticed that
the front brakes are not hot.  I pulled the hubs and adjusted the parking
brake thinking that maybe it was dragging, but that did not help.  I thought
that possibly the heat of the engine cause the transfer.  Any help would be
appreciated.  Thanks.
