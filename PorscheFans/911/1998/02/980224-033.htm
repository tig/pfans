Looks like I am able to answer my own question.  This morning I poked around at
Bilstein until I found somebody in their Motorsports department who really knew
911s and wasn't just reading off a sheet like the first two people I talked to
(they admitted that's what they were doing).  The sales guy I talked to
yesterday definitely didn't have the right year, or model, or something.  Today
I spoke to Lou in their Motorsports department, who also, before he made his
final recommendation, talked to another person in the department who has been
with Bilstein for over 20 years.  Here's a synopsis of the info I got this
morning.

The Sport shocks are specifically designed for giving an edge in competitive
driving on the order of a few tenths of a second per lap.  The tradeoff is a
substantially stiffer ride.  They were originally designed for the Turbo with
heavier rear end and more power.  The HDs (Heavy Duty) are far and away the
better choice if saving split seconds from your lap time is not as important as
a more comfortable overall ride.  The HDs provide a good balanced overall ride
with plenty of performance for the occasional DE, Autocross, back roads
driving, etc.  The recommendation for my scenario was overwhelmingly HD, not
Sport.

A few people responded to my request with "please let me know what you find
out"; hopefully this is sufficient.  I'm definitely getting the HDs.

Good luck to anyone else out there considering a similar tradeoff!  I would
highly recommend calling Bilstein (1-800-537-1085) and asking right off for
their Motorsports department and ask specifically for someone with 911 (or your
model) expertise.
