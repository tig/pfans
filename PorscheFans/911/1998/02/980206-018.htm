To all:

This is from a guy who enjoys driving quickly. I agree with Scott
Winders and others about the airing out of one's Porsche. It WAS
possible to do this 25 years ago in rural areas. Even 20 years ago. But
the limiting factor for driving fast is not the cops or the road, but
the congestion on the highways.

The closing speed at anything over 80MPH on an urban US highway is too
great to have an adequate safety margin. I can play alittle, but I;m not
doing much for my fellow PCA members if I piss someone off and you're
behind me. These other people a plain dumb on the highway.

It is possible to get a run up to 140-150 MPH on a US highway. That's
why we have Nevada and Montana. There's nothing out there to bother and
the traffic spread is such that high cruising speeds are possible. BTDT.

But the congestion and a generation of rolling idiots that think they
are invulnerable in their SUVs and other automotive crap are the
priciple problem. There is no way to effectivly predict what dumb thing
they will do in front of you or in response to your much higher
velocity. 

Some of these crumbs are just plain brain-dead and unaware of the rest
of us on the highway. Others think they're Broderick Crawford and want
to punish you for what you own or what they think you might do that they
can't. But you don't want to hit one of them or have the crumb say you
caused him/her to spill hot coffee on him/herself and get a burn.

Go to the track for a driver's ed event. Time trial. Road race. But play
it cool when out on the road. 

I don't drive my Porsches to work anymore. The traffic is just too
dense  and the people a little too rude. But I have seen many other
Porsche owners do some damn stupid stuff in the same traffic. Be cool
everyone.
