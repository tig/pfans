Peter I'll speak for the group and say we we're all in this position at one
time
or another and I'm sure there are only a very few that have wished they'd
waited or not 
purchased at all. Given the fact that you've done all the correct things,
pre-purchase
inspection etc. just go buy it, drive it daily, enjoy it for what it is.
   First off buy a fresh can of Zymol and clean the girl up, you will get a
true appreciation
of her curves and lines. Only then will you realize our affinity for such a
fine automobile. 
Step back and enjoy the view for you've just obtained what few people in this
world can.

Denny
