Congratulations!  The car sounds beautiful!

I can only comment on the Dunlop SP4000's.  I had a set of these, and was very
disappointed!  (I should mention that they were on a VW, not a 911, however.)
 They only lasted 14k miles (despite their high mileage rating) with spirited
street driving and a few autocrosses.  But, any road-handling or all-season
abilities that they had while new were quickly diminished in the first few
thousand miles!  They soon began to squeal around every corner.

I would have to suggest that, since you plan to drive only in good weather, you
stay away from the "all-season" performance tires like the SP4000.

But, I would also have to question your plan to never bring the car close to
its limits!  These cars are meant to be driven!  If it were me, I'd set up a
tire budget, strap SP-8000's all the way around, take her to a few Driver's Ed
events, and see what she can do!  (To each his own, however!)

FWIW:  I'm a fan of BFG Comp T/A ZR's.  Don't know if you've thought about
these.  But, many people believe these don't belong on a Porsche.

Good luck!
David
