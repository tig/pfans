 1) it does not have A/C. OK, I live in Belgium, this is not California
 or Florida, but even a little sun in spring will heat up a car's
 interior to an uncomfortable level. As my 911 will be my third car,
 and thus good weather only, I'd like to find out through this list how
 badly you need A/C in a 911. And what the disadvantages are of having
 one
 (does it work properly ? does it need lots of maintenance ? how well
 does
 it age  ? (as I am considering cars that are 10 years old)).

***Forget the AC, as a former owner of an 88 911 it's marginal at best.
Considering your weather environment, the age of the car, and the cost of
maintaining a marginal system in reasonably working condition, IMO, you're
better off without it.  Added benefit...you save about 100 pounds in dead
weight!
I also noted you have a Miata which we had too.  For comparison, the Miata AC
cooled better WITH THE TOP DOWN than our 88 Carrera Coupe did with the windows
closed...no kidding...:-))****
 
 2) it does have a sun roof. Good for ventilation, but I remember reading
 about leakages. This sun roof is 10 years old, what about the chance of
 it leaking ? How noisy is a 911 sunroof anyway ? (I've driven several
 cars
 that had quiet sunroofs, others were real nuisances due to excessive
 noise levels or sounds)

***Check the seals.  You can tell if it has been leaking by looking at the
headliner and the area around the opening for any evidence of water stains and
surface rust.  Considering the relatively small opening, the noise levels are
not bad depending on your height.  Make sure you have adequate head room.  In
the earlier 911's, you'd loose about 1-2 inches with a sunroof, but the seat
rail design and power seats of the later models seemed to offset this
disadvantage.*****

 
 3) it has 9" wide turbo rims at the rear. Great looks, but they do get
 very
 close to the bodywork. And I suppose the 245 tire size does get a little
 more expensive than the 8" 225 sizes commonly used on this model. And
 what about the car's balance, handling ? How is it affected by the use
 of wider wheels and tires at the rear (front are "classic" 7x16 205's).
 
 4) the previous owner lowered the car to the extreme. Again great looks,
 but am I not better off raising it back to it's normal ride height ?
 
 All your good advice is more than welcome. I let one very good 89
 Carrera go end of last year for lack of good advice. I do not want to
 make the same mistake again.
 
  >>
***Sorry I can't help on the last two.  I'd return it to the original size
wheel and tire on the rear when you replace them.*******

Good luck, sounds like a relatively good car at a reasonably price.  As
usually, even though the seller is a reputable shop, have someone else
knowledgable check it out...it's worth a "second opinion" before you finalize
the purchase.
