911 Turbos were available to the public (in Europe) in 1975.  I have a
reprint of a magazine test of one of these things where they specifically
state that their test car is a 1975 model. They refer to it as "one of the
most expensive, most exotic supercars in the world" with a price tag
of 15,497 (British pounds).  Also two different articles refer to the
car as a "Turbo Coupe" not a 911 Turbo or a 930, FWIW.

My 2 schillings or whatever they're called...
