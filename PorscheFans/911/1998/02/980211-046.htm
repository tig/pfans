I have a 1983 SC and would like to add an alarm, both for the 
convenience of keyless entry and the insurance discount.  I'm not sure 
that the protection is anymore significant than the blinking red 
light..If they want the car, they'll take it anyway...

My question:  Anyone have any sob stories about the various alarms on 
the market?  I had a Clifford on my other car and like it. Any good 
remarks on any of the alarms out there?  I wnat something that will not 
false alarm, etc.

Next problem:  My car runs fine, just a bit too rich.  I saw one of my 
manuals that the OXS light should come on when the car does, and then 
go out.  I have never seen it light up.  I assume either the bulb is 
out or the system is malfunctioning.  The car has 96K miles, and I 
don't see anywhere in the records that the lambda sensor has been 
replaced.  I'd like to pool the collective wisdom of the group before I 
endeavour to remove the thing.  From prior posts, it looks a bit tricky 
to get out.

Thanks in advance

Chris Jares
