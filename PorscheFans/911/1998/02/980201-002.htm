Hi PFans,

I'm after some information from someone with an SC model car and the 
factory option fog/driving lights.

On my car, the right side light seems to have been installed upside 
down. The drain hole is at the top, not to mention the cover for the 
bulb is around the wrong way.

"Hey terry, why don't you just unscrew it and turn it around" you 
say.

Well this is why I'm after some info.

Both lights have the wire which runs back to the body through the 
valance on the outside of the car. By this I mean that the hole in 
the valance is between the mounting support and the edge of the car.
 
Now for the left light, this is fine because the cable access hole at 
the back of the light is on the left side. 

Yep, you guessed it. The cable access hole for the right side, when 
installed upside down is on the right, giving that  wonderful 
symmetrical look. If the light was installed right way up, the hole 
in the valance would be on the opposite side to the access hole at 
the back of the light, giving that "I need a longer cable so it 
reaches across the mounting bracket and gee, doesn't that look a bit 
sad" type of finish.

Checking my Automotion and Stoddards catalogs leads me to believe 
that there is only a single part number and you order two of 
911.631.206.03 for the pair of lights, so I don't think I've got two 
lefts instead of a left and a right.

Could someone check their SC (and earlier if it's the same setup) 
and let me know what configuration you have. 

thanks

terry
