Dear PFans:

I don't normally endorse companies, but I wanted to share a positive 
experience (for a change) with a quality operation.  For years, I've 
been a Zymol fan.  You know the stuff, put it on, leave it on until 
it dries, sand blast it off.  The shine was pretty good once you got 
it off.  You may have noticed that Zymol is now carried by Wal-Mart 
and the like.  Guess what - the Wal-Mart Zymol is produced by Turtle 
Wax.  I wouldn't bet my bottom dollar, but I'd say the Wal-Mart Zymol 
is slightly under the original formula's quality???

Anyway, enough about the "blue" stuff.  When looking for a better 
(easier) way to clean and protect my car, I ran across a company that 
was willing to talk about a different way to take care of my Porsche. 
 Which I cherish more than my...well never mind, lets just say a lot. 
 The company in questions is "Car Care Specialities" out of Saddle 
Brook, NJ.  You can reach them on the net through E-mail at: 
carcaresp@aol.com or call them at 201-796-8300.  Ask for one of their 
free catalogs.  Got some great stuff, with their personal ratings of 
the products.  I tried the 3M Mirror Glaze, Blitz Wax,  and Black 
Again Rubber Rx; all with excellent results.  These were some of 
their recommended products.  The glaze and wax are all easy on easy 
off.  The results are outstanding. (I was a little pessimistic at 
first - the products were too easy to use - I didn't work up a good 
sweat - but he results were as advertised.)

Give these guy a try.  Over the telephone, their support is also 
excellent.  If you try them, let me know what you think.  I feel 
you'll be like me, pleasantly surprised, with a good looking scar.
