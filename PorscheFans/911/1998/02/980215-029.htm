Recap:
Due to years of baking away in the engine compartment, and (arguably)
affected by the new oxygenated fuel, the rubber sections of the
pressurized fuel line assembly have dried, cracked and started leaking. 
I discovered the problem when I smelled fuel vapors, opened the engine
lid, and noticed a spray of gasoline, coming from a crack in the rubber
hose, directed on the intake manifold (VERY Scary).

Parts:
As I mentioned in the original story, I ordered the new fuel line
assembly for the bargain basement price of $400.  That sounds like
alot.  But, it is the genuine Porsche part, and the Porsche retail is
$478.35.  So, I saved roughly 20% :-)  I also reported that this new
part went all the way to the fuel pump, and had some insulation to
prevent future degradation (That's what i was lead to believe...foolish
me).  To the contrary, however, the fuel line assembly goes only as far
as the fuel filter in the engine compartment.  Also, the rubber hosing
appears to be relatively normal with no appearant insulation or odd
material.  It may be bonded in, but I doubt it.  As far as I can tell,
the part was superceeded only because the bent brass hosing was very
slightly re-routed.  In all other respects, it appears to be the same as
the old part.  So, I envision this happening again 10 years from now.
:-(

Repair:
Yesterday, I completed the repair (Thanks go to Mike Ong for some good
advise on the proceedure).  It took me roughly 6 hours and lots of
swearing, twisting, scraped knuckles and raw finger tips.  If anyone
wants the proceedure let me know.  I'll type up what I went through (I'm
just glad I have small hands).  The jist of it is that the fuel line
must come out toward the front (firewall/passenger compartment side) of
the engine.  After disconnecting the fuel line from the fuel rails and
maneuvering it around a bit, the rubber hosing started cracking and
further disintegrating, so I was totally commited to the R&R.  That was
a bit discomforting, because the old one came out really difficultly.  I
mean, on several occasions, I got into that mode where the part is
somewhat stuck/bound and you just tell yourself 'Oh to hell with it' and
yank.  Of course, the new one had to get in somehow??  Luckily, the new
one went in MUCH easier than the old one came out (There is a P-God
:-).  Anyway, everything is back together and running like new.

Post Mortem:
I replaced the main fuel line assembly, and the 'bypass' fuel line
running from the pressure regulator to the other fuel rail on the front
of the engine.  Good move by me!  Upon further inspection, all the
rubber hosing, on the main assembly as well as the bypass line, was
dried and cracking.  This is a VERY serious problem.  I know age is the
factor, but 10 years doesn't really seem terribly old in a PCar's life. 
Anyway, I encourage everyone (Especially 84-89 Carerra) to check your
rubber fuel line sections for health.  In my case, it was a Disaster on
the verge, and I don't think my car is at all unusual.

Keep Porsching,
