PFans:

It seems that my pulley half is eating away at the key on the fan and
vice versa.  The tell tail sign that this is happening is a black sooty
powder that builds up over the alternator nuts.  Also, some inconsistent
metal pinging noises.  If you look at your pulley what was once a semi
squarish cutout in the middle will now look like two semi squarish
cutouts imposed over one another but slightly out of alignment.  If you
get as bad as mine it will look like a snow angel.  This is bad bad bad.

So I will need a new/used 11 blade fan to fit an 82 SC.  It is very
important that the keyed part is in EXCELLENT shape.  I already have a
new pulley half.  If you have one please let me know ASAP.  I will be
changing it by Friday and I would like to avoid the new price.

How long should it take me to change out the fan anyway?  I was thinking
of painting it with bbq paint to match the red engine covering... good
bad...?

Here is an interesting one:
I turned off the car with the turnsignals still going.  When I turned it
on again they would not blink.  They would go on and stay on.  I turned
the car off making sure that the signals were not on.  Turned the car on
again and all was well again.  Nothing is broken as far as I can tell,
but a strange thing to make this happen...

Enjoy!

-Michael
