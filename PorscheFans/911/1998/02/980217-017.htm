Well Kerry,
I guess I'm luckier than you!  My husband loves his 944, but ALSO me.  He
has proved this by buying me a '69 911S last November, and together we
spend (seemingly) all our $ fixing it up.  It is getting the front pan
metal replaced (where it has rusted under the 2 batteries), interior work,
and eventually a new paint job.  I talk about "my" car all the time, and
sometimes he does wonder if I love it more than him, but when I compare it
to his devotion to his car, he understands.  About the Audi (I think it was
an Audi)...I also drive a Subaru Legacy SW in the winter, as I live in
Montana, and as alot of good things are  to be said of Subarus, there is
absolutely nothing compared to driving a high-revving screaming machine on
the Montana Autobahn!  Oh, and his 944 will also be getting a new paint job
this summer, as well.  Maybe you should let your husband test drive the
Sportster so he can fall in love with the car and come to realize what an
intelligent woman you really are.		Pam.
