<<The Speedbleeder appears to be a variation of an item that has been around
almost forever, and that can be found at almost any autoparts store for about
$5, although it's only worth about $1.  It's a simple ball and spring check-
valve, usually inserted in a plastic tube that can be slipped over the bleeder
valve.  The Speedbleeder simply puts the check-valve right into bleeder valve.
I suppose it's a clever idea, but you'll still have to crawl under each wheel
to release the Speedbleeder, and unless you want to have  brake fluid
squirting all over, you'll want to slip tubing over it to direct it to a
receptacle, and you'll need someone to watch what's coming out to see when
there are no more bubbles so you know the air has bled out and you can stop
bleeding that caliper unless you rig an elaborate set of mirrors, all of which
sort of makes one wonder about the advantage of the Speedbleeder over the
commonly available el-cheapo check-valve, or the even cheaper plain vanilla
hose inserted into a cup with a bit of brake fluid in it.>>

I have found the method described by Alan Caldwell in a past Pano article
inexpensive and very effective for 1-person bleeding. Get some lengths of
clear plastic tubing (about 2.5' long) from the hardware store. Its I.D.
should fit snugly over the O.D. of the bleeder screw. Place one end over the
bleeder screw and suspend it vertically somehow, you want the other end up.
Now open the bleeder screw and let gravity allow the brake fluid from the
master cylinder to enter and exit the caliper taking whatever air bubbles
there are with it. The fluid level will rise only to the height of the fluid
in the master cylinder. This part is very visual as you can see the bubbles
rise to the top of the fluid in the tube. Tap the caliper with a metal object
to loosen any bubbles that may cling inside. Using this method you can even
work the brake pedal to speed up the process. Want to replace the fluid? Curve
the end of the tubing over into a can and let it drip out while keeping an eye
on the master cylinder. With the reservoir almost empty, add new fluid .... or
start with a turkey baster and save a few minutes watching the fluid go down.
When you see fresh fluid exiting the caliper, close the screw. You can do all
4 wheels simultaneously or just 1 at a time.
