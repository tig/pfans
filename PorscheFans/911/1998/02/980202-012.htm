John,

When I had my engine shipped, I picked it up at their warehouse (this was
Yellow Freight), since I also did not have forklift or loading ramp.  I
had them load it onto my trailer (low 4x8).  When I got home, I levered the
pallet onto one of those furniture dollies, and used 2 4x8 as ramps to
slide the pallet off.  In a pinch, you could go to Uhaul and rent a cheapie
garden trailer for $10; it's low, and already has a ramp so you can load/unload
small garden tractors, mowers, etc.

Good luck,
Mike
