Wow, it's great to hear of somebody who doesn't think tuning a car with 6
separate carburetors is complicated enough.  You have to start changing
things.

I recently overhauled my Solexes, and found disassembly-reassembly to be
pretty easy.  But, I nearly succumbed to the highly polluted exhaust as a
real expert tried to tune the things yesterday.  The engine was just
rebuilt, and isn't supposed to stay tuned until the rings and valves seat. 
If I drive the car by a smog inspection station all the cars there will be
identified as gross polluters.  

I did find this in my parts catalog.

901.100.920.00	Conversion set for 6 - 8 PS additional output.  
		type 911 carburetor Solex. consisting of:

901.108.924.01	Choke tube 34 dia.			6
616.100.900.00	Air correction jet 200			6
999.170.022.90	Spark plug Bosch W 265 P 21		6
901.108.082.00	Cover for carburetor			2

You shouldn't have much trouble finding the equivalent sparkplugs in the
modern Bosch numbering scheme, you might be able to find the air correction
jets.  I don't even know what the covers for the carburetors are--maybe
they are some low restriction substitute for the air cleaner.

The Porsche exhaust is probably sufficiently free-flowing that you won't
need to make any changes there for 6 to 8 hp.
