I recently purchased a '98 C4S.  The front right brake squeaks loudly when
gently applying pressure.  After being warmed up it diminishes, but is still
apparent.     

The dealer (Rusnak in LA) I purchased the car from indicated to expect this
during the break in period.  After driving from LA to Seattle, it still was
very loud.   I took it in to my local dealer (Barrier Motors) and was told
this was normal and that Porsche just hasn't found the right material for
the turbo brakes.  They cleaned up some rust and sent me on my way.    

If this was normal - why are the other 3 brakes not squeaking ?   Any
suggestions ?  Unfortunately, not being a mechanic, I am at the mercy of the
dealer.  

Regards - Sharon.
