Hi P-Fans,

I just got off the phone with my American Family insurance agent
regarding coverage during a driver's ed event.  He stated that I would
not be covered because the policy states that "preparation for or
participation in an organized or prearranged racing or speed
competition" is not covered.  Despite my explanation that driver's ed is
neither racing nor a speed competition, the agent stated that it is
considered "preparation for" and therefore is excluded from coverage.

Those of you out there who participate in driver's ed, do your insurance
companies cover you?  If so, which insurance company?  Do I have any
other option besides switching to a company that is willing to cover me
for driver's ed events?

Thanks in advance.
