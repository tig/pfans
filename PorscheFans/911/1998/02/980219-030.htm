    No, Oliver, it doesn't SOUND too bad... But if it were really so
    easy, don't you think the seller would repair it himself?

    Your mechanic is absolutely correct... Here's an excerpt from
    something I wrote a year or so ago:

        Dry powder's great for the kitchen, but please don't use it
        in your car if you can help it.

        The deal is this:  The old-style dry powder will DESTROY
        aluminum or magnesium.  It also eats through electrical
        insulation and will probably damage most plastic components.

        I don't know whether Purple-K is as corrosive. 
        Nevertheless, it's STILL a bad idea to use it, since the
        powder is FOREVER, and it gets EVERYWHERE.  Words cannot
        describe the extent of the damage you'll do... Unless you've
        seen the results of a dry-powder extinguisher activation
        inside a car, you wouldn't believe it.

        My advice to anyone who's discharged a dry-powder
        extinguisher in his car (or in the car's engine compartment),
        is, "Sell it THIS INSTANT, before the powder COMPLETELY
        dissolves your car. Take whatever you can get and cut your
        losses."

        It's IMPOSSIBLE to clean that stuff up; it'll get into
        electrical connectors, gauge movements, switches, your
        stereo, air vents, etc.  Needless to say, it's unlikely to do
        much good in ANY of those locations.

        With a burning-but-insured car in front of me and only a
        dry-powder extinguisher at hand, I'd be VERY ambivalent
        about discharging it.
