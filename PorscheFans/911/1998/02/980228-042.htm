I have been using Escort products since 1982, going from the original
Escort  to the Passport, then the 4600, now Solo 5. The Val-1 is the best
detector out there, but what do you need? I like the Solo 5 for the
cordless feature, which admittedly (via Car & Drivers tests) is less
effective than a corded model. I used to drive 80-85 during the 55 limit
days, so I bought the best detector out there (which was the Escort
products). If you never drive more than 10 mph over the limit, don't
bother with a detector, you are pretty safe. I now drive 78-79 in 65
zones, so my Solo 5 cordless is fine. If I were racking up 30K miles a
year (as I did in the past) and drove over 80 mph regularly, I would pop
for the Val-1.
