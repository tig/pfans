Pfans, [this is a longish newbie post so feel free to hit DEL now]

A few weeks ago I posted a message asking for advice on a targa purchase.
I was amazed (and grateful) at the number of responses, and it was evident
that you folks really love these cars. The advice I received made me more
confident (in the car) and yet more cautious at the same time. I was 
looking at an '87 targa, and quite a few people cautioned that they leak
and that they don't look as aggressive as a coupe. Funny, I actually was
looking for a coupe. That is, until I discovered this car. It is in 
excellent original condition with all stock parts. It's got the special
order metallic cassis red paint -- I really love this color! It's subtle
yet somehow sleek and sexy (okay I'm a glutton for sports cars).

At first I was concerned over the grumbling noises coming from the G50
tranny, but the mechanic (and many of you folks, in the archives) said 
that it was normal. And after getting used to the clutch action, I can
drive without making it groan. I also learned a hard lesson about the
infamous targa leaking during the last el nino storm over CA, water 
under the seat toasted the DME relay (thank God it didn't toast the 
DME computer along with it). Oh well, from what I've been reading it's
probably a good thing the relay has been replaced.

So I checked out the option codes at www.kindell.com (very cool!) and
it came up with the following:

  018 - Sport steering wheel with elevated hub - sounds good, but does
        anybody know what the difference is from the standard wheel?
        What does the elevated hub buy me?

  158 - Radio "Monterey" - 86 "Reno" - 87 - Not too sure what I think
        about blaupunkt yet, but I have an alpine CD that's probably
        going into the 911. I am baffled over how to get good sound
        in a porsche, due to the lack of a hollow trunk (aka speaker
        box). I guess subwoofers are in order, but then I need a 
        crossover. Has anybody tried planar speakers on the back 
        shelf? How about speaker enclosures, anybody experienced 
        with putting 6x9s back there (I love my boston acoustics).

  341 - Central locking system - Cool. James Bond kinda stuff <g>

  395 - Light metal wheels - forged - These are 16" fuchs that are
        polished chrome. I remember reading about some cleaners that
        are not good for these wheels. Should I use chrome cleaner 
        or something else? Also, the car apparently has fairly new 
        pirellis that are the same as stock (can anyone confirm 
        pirellis were stock in 87?)

 425 - Rear wiper - Seems like more of a PITA than its worth
 
 437 - Comfort seat left - Nicely adjustable. Wish I had the
       lumbar support though (my Rx7 had a manual lumbar dial)     

 438 - Comfort seat right - Even for the passenger. Classy.
 
 454 - Automatic speed control - Cruise is definitely nice

 474 - Sport shock absorbers (Bilsteins) - Cool! What's the deal
       with Bilsteins anyways? I bet these are worn out though, is 
       there any way to tell? (the car has 90k miles). What would
       it cost to replace the bilsteins (as original)?

 533 - Alarm system - Yeah but the PO disabled the porsche alarm
       and put another one in, the disconnected that (sheesh).
       Service records indicate that the alarm was draining the
       battery. Not even sure if the replacement alarm is still 
       in the car, I'll have to hunt for it.

 C03 - California type car - The cat came back the very next day

Huh? It didn't list A/C as an option. Was A/C standard, or maybe it
was added on after? In any case, I'm pretty sure the A/C is toast,
probably leaking freon like a seive. From what I read in the 
archives (I've read 10 months worth, seriously, shooting to read 
them all, great info) the A/C units suck anyways, and even mods
don't seem to successful. One of you p-gurus should put together
an A/C upgrade package that actually works, you will make some 
green based on demand for a good A/C. There *must* be a way to
get some cooling in that car!

Somebody advised that my biggest problem would be getting the 
car to pass CA smog test. Another begged to differ, stating 
that the 3.2s are some of the cleanest burning engines around.
Check out the smog results:

    At 2500 rpm     Allowable     Average     Reading
      HC ppm          140            20          7
      CO %           1.00          0.10       0.01

    At Idle
      HC ppm          120            29          6
      CO %           1.00          0.10       0.01

Looks pretty clean to me! Also indicates that the car is 
running well. I once scored 500% over acceptable limits
with a rotary Rx7, and some simple tuning brought it in
line. BTW if anyone takes any car for smog test in CA,
be sure to do the PRE-TEST first. The pre-test does not
send the results to the DMV computer system. If your 
car gets classified as a gross pollutor (would have 
been the case with the Rx7) you have to take the car 
to a state referee who will make your life miserable.

Well, I put 3000 miles on so far, and the car has only
used just over a quart of oil. I can see NO oil leaks
anywhere in the engine compartment. So far so good.

I joined the PCA and it turns out that I'm in the 
Golden Gate region. Anybody out there from the gate?
How many members are there and what are the events 
like? Is there driver's ed in the bay area? I also
found out that there is a Loma Prieta chapter. Cool,
I live in the santa cruz mountains. I would guess 
that the Loma Prieta chapter is pretty small. Is
there anyone out there from quake country? If so,
do you enjoy the twists along hwy 17 (aka blood
alley, one of the most dangerous CA highways)?

I am having a BLAST so far. The question is, how do 
you STOP driving? I've seen (read) how much fun you
guys are having beefing up the cars with mods. And
although it sounds tempting (and addictive) I think
I'll keep my targa exactly as original. Sheesh. 
That probably means I'm gonna need a project car 
too. In due time. I'm the addictive type to start
with, and I've really caught the bug now, so I 
think I'm gonna be in BIG TROUBLE hee hee.

I know I'm gonna regret asking this, but has anyone
actually priced a replacement OEM targa top? Would
it be worth more than your average 

Thanx for the tips everyone, and all I can say is 
that I should have got into p-cars sooner (I've 
been driving rotaries for eons).  

Somebody mentioned that they think they have the exact
same car. Care to compare numbers and see how close we 
came off the production line? 

  -- Doug   ('87 Carrera Targa - Cassis Red)

PS. A white 356 was behind me on hwy 17 this morning.
    Now I know what kind of project car I want!
