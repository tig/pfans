Hopefully this is accurate, but I am working off a combination of my
notes, the Porsche wiring diagram and memory. I think it is
right..........

Basically your headlight switch currently directs the current (with the
main light switch on) to the headlight bulbs via two wires: a yellow
which sends current for low beams and a white wire which directs the
current for high beams. There is a relay upstream of the fuse panel
which seems to be in place to allow the flasher switch to turn on the
high beams rather than the low beams. It does not have an effect in this
set up as it is before (electrically speaking) the relay you are going
to install.
What in effect you have to do is to use the yellow and white wires
coming off of your dimmer switch on the steering column  to switch a
relay which in turn sends current to the lights and the only current
going through the switch is that required to switch the relay.....which
is sfa and not any strain on the contacts.

The Porsche relay's socket (901 612 333 00) has 5 wires connected to
them............they are:

Terminal           Function
30                      Switched current supply (red)
85                      Ground for switching current (brown)
86                      Power for switching current (grey)
87                      Switched currrent output (relay not recieving
switching curren aka default position) (red/white)
87a                    Switched current output (relay recieving
switching current)   (red/white)

For low beam relay control.........the yellow wire which goes to the
power side of S5/S6 on the front fuse panel (they have an internal
connection) goes to the grey wire on the relay. The brown wire goes to
ground, pick a likely looking wire (I tied it to the big ground
connection near the battery, but then again I am anally retentive and
neurotic, you may want to take an easier one). The red wire needs to
pick up power from another fuse on the front panel (I used S17) and
supplies power to the headlights. The default (87/red and white on
relay) is free..........not connected to anything as you don't want the
power from S17 going anywhere if the headlights are not on. Make sure
that there are no bare wires coming out of this (I cut it short and then
put heat shrink tubing over it).The other red and white (off of 87a)
goes to where the yellow wire used to be, at the power side of S5/S6.
Voila, relay controlled low beams!!

For high beam control, it is basically the same except that the power
from the dimmer switch for high beams is white and connected to the
power side of S7/S8. It then goes to the grey wire on its relay (86),
brown to a ground (85), red wire to a fuse on the panel (S17 is fine),
default red and white (off of 87 on relay) is not connected, other red
and white (87a) is connected where white used to be at the power side of
S7/S8.

Note that the power (red) does not need to have a fuse on the input side
of things (ie you can connect it to the side which is closest to the
battery electrically speaking) as you have 2 fuses for each headlight in
S5 thru S8. Minor risk that the relay will go nuts and cook something,
but I was willing to take the chance..

Note also that the plastic on the relay holder is fairly stiff and can
be a pain to fit into the panel......I just boiled some water and soaked
the relay holder (minus relay of course) until the heat made the plastic
soft and then it popped in no problem at all. Resulting effect is that
it all looks stock and is (IMHO) "right".

Hope this helps.......
