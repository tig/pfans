Re:		993 Cab Top Replacement

I replaced my 96' C4 Cab top because I wanted to change the color from =
navy blue to black -  the car is midnight blue metallic. The after =
market top was from GAHH. They make tops, carpet kits etc., for just =
about every car and in every color and material. My German canvas top =
with new window and headliner retailed for about $1450. I let Cactus =
Upholstery (415.339.1323) take the markup on wholesale on the parts and =
they installed the top complete including parts for $1600. So I guess =
$150 for installation. Installation should take from 3 to 4 hours. I got =
quotes from $1600 to $2000 for this job. I got quotes on German canvas =
tops from $750 (Anzio's Bad Boys - complete with window and headliner) =
to $1150 (World Upholstery - with window but not including headliner - =
$1750 with headliner) to $1230 (wholesale price from GAHH with window =
and headliner). Anzio's one offs the tops, World has not made a lot of =
993 tops therefore I selected GAHH because of their vast experience at =
making tops. Just about every upholstery shop uses GAHH and they have =
made lots of 993 tops already. The top is perhaps not as perfect in fit =
- but very very close -  to factory. Stitching etc. is identical, but =
the canvas at the bottom edges is not as stiff and the center cross =
reinforcement is not the same -  it is sewn while the factory's is some =
kind of proprietary glued job. The top is just as tight as factory. =
NOTE: the difference in the tops is much more affected by who installs =
the top and if they do it right than any difference in the tops =
themselves. Don't install it yourself! Make sure to replace the elastic =
straps which pull the rear window back on opening with new factory =
straps (a few bucks each).

As to factory tops. They retail for $2550 for the top (skin only) -  =
although I did find a dealer in L.A. willing to part with a skin for =
$2100, plus $450 for the window plus about $300 for the headliner =
(prices not including tax on all of this) plus the only one who can =
install the factory top is the dealer who charges 10 hours labor to do =
it (a total of $850 from my dealer- they are the only ones because only =
they seem to be willing to invest in the $3500 piece of equipment whose =
sole purpose in life is to electrically melt in the glued window. Other =
shops won't invest that kind of money in such a single purpose machine =
when there currently very little market to replace 993 tops). So for a =
factory top I was looking at (retail installed) $4150 plus tax ($3700 =
given the lower skin price). I felt that the difference in the tops =
considered I'd rather replace my top in three years still having spent =
less ($3200 in total to replace mine twice) than the price of a single =
new factory top. I could sell the car then, with a brand new top, and =
still be ahead of the game.

Cactus did a great job, they also replaced my carpets (complete interior =
carpet kit from GAHH with vinyl instead of Porsche plastic trim =
standard), recovered some of the door panels and installed leather =
inserts in the seats - all of this again for color change.

Regards,

Thanks, Mark, I found their ad.

Do you recall what the price breakout was for the top?

Was the quality equal to factory?

Howcum a top replacement so early on your 96?

>On my 96 993 C4 Cab I just had my carpet, seats, side panels and top
done/replaced by Cactus in Sausalito, Calif.

>You may find their adds in recent Excellence mags with a picture of a
complete Boxer interior (in red/black) that they did.
