After doing a really stupid thing this afternoon, I've got a question.

How tight should the fan belt on my 2.7l be.  I started my engine with the
drop cloth still on it that I've been using to keep dust off the engine.  The
cloth got caught in the pully and broke the belt.  I had a spare and put it on
(that was a treat) but want to know how much play there should be.  As is
right now, I can flex the belt about 1/4"-3/8".  Too much, too little?

BTW.  The first person who was going to paint my car bailed out on me, but
luckily I found someone better.  He should pick up the car in the next week or
so.  Maybe I'll be able to drive the car again by the end of spring before it
gets too hot (since I pulled all the old AC out).

Thanks
