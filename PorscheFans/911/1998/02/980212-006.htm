P-Fans:

Was driving home last night and it was raining.  Not hard, but enough so
everything got wet.  Just cruising along and then came to an exit to
another highway I take.  I hit the brakes and nothing happened.  Pedal
was firm so I pressed harder and I finally started to slow down.  I have
not had any brake problems before this.  I drove a little further and
went to test the brakes again.  Same thing except they started to work
faster.  I then did a series of start and stops on the side of the road
and they worked normally.  From this I then drove for 5 mins at 50-60
and tried them and they were slippery again.

So, I think that I have no brakes at all when they get wet/cold and I am
going > 40 mph.  This is not safe and needs to be fixed ASAP.  I looked
at the pads when I got home (just a through the spoke look) and they
looked like they had a lot to go before replacement.  Rotors were smooth
without grooves or lips.  Rotors are not cross drilled or slotted.  I am
not sure what pads the PO had in the car, but I have had no problem
driving for the last 6 mos.  Before yesterday the car stopped on a dime,
even in slush.  I checked the fluid and the reservoir looks to be full,
though there are no full/fill marks };(

I was hoping that the sign that I needed new brakes would come as a
gradual reduction in braking and not as what I would call a complete
brake failure.

I drove to work this morning after running around a couple of blocks
testing the brakes and all seemed well.  I use down shifting and a
relaxed throttle to keep me in line on the highways and really try not
use my brakes that much.  Could it be that this style has somehow made
my brakes sketchy? or 'glazed'.  If the rotors are 'glazed' would I see
this kind of effect?  If they are glazed can I go out and stomp on the
brakes a few times to correct this?  Perhaps I do not understand this
concept of glazing... 

I have an outside theory which follows:

They use a lot of salt on the road here in Boston.  If I got my rotors
covered in salty water when the rotor dried it would leave a layer of
salt on the rotor.  When I would go to brake, the salt would liquefy due
to heat and become a nice little lubricant between the rotor and
pads....


Your recommendations please.

-Michael the unbraked.
