You removed the pads and pumped the pedal?  And DIDN'T get a piston
to completely pop out of the caliper?  Careful; this could cause you to
require to remove a caliper to get a popped piston reinstalled (did this by
accident on my old '76).  If you have to pump the brakes, put in old
brake backing plates or worn pads; don't pump them with nothing installed.

If you pushed gently and only saw one piston move, this might be normal.
When you pump, the fluid will take the path of least resistance; this is to
move
the one piston with the least resistance.  If the other piston starts moving
after
the first one stops due to hitting the rotor or pad, you're probably OK.
Better test is to see if wear on inner and outer pad are approx. equal; if so,
you probably don't have a problem.  Another test is to drive car a few miles,
come to gentle stop with minimal brake use, and carefully feel each caliper
(start by feeling the center of the wheel first, make sure this isn't hot);
left and right sides should feel the same.  Another test is with car stopped
let
the clutch out slightly to get car JUST moving, then disengage clutch.  Does
car immediately stop (indication of dragging brake) or roll smoothly to stop
(no brake drag).

One thing which I found helps the piston/caliper is with worn pads in place,
pry the pistons back till they're fully pushed into the caliper (can do this
with pry bar betrween pad and rotor).  Now pump the 
brake slowly to withdraw the pistons and engage the pads.  Repeat a few
times.  This helps to reduce any piston stickiness.

If you are unsure about the age of the fluid, a brake bleeding/flush is 
recommended.  This is to get rid of old fluid.    Use a turkey baster to
pull out the old fluid in the reservoir, refill with new fluid (Castrol LMA is
my
preference for street cars), then bleed the system.  If calipers are not
leaking
fluid, and the pistons are not sticking, I see no reason to rebuild them.

One other item - check the rubber seals between the piston and caliper.
My experience is these deteriorate fairly soon.  They can be pried out
and replaced while the caliper is installed with a little care.

P-Dudes:

    I am replacing the front brake pads on my '78 SC Euro.  I noticed
after I removed the front pads and pumped the brake pedal a few times,
that only 1 piston on each side was pushing out(in). The other piston
seemed to move very little, if at all.
    Is this normal? Is there a problem with my braking system? Do I need
to bleed the brake system? Or does this mean I'm going to have to
rebuild the calipers? Any idea how much time would be involved and what
the approximate cost would be of a caliper(s) rebuild? I have no idea
when any brake work was done on this car. It has 109K miles on the
clock.
    Any help you might offer would be greatly appreciated!

    Thanks alot,
