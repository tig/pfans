Derek,

When at speed, above about 2000 rpm, the instant
you let up on the accelerator the rpm sensor/solenoid
cpmbination immediately cuts off fuel flow from the MFI pump.
Immediately, not slowly.  When the rpms fall below about 1500 rpm, fuel
flow starts again.  You know that a cold engine sometimes takes
a few cranks to get going.  Thus even though fuel starts
to flow, the cold engine may not 'restart', so to speak, in time,
and it will die.

The problem appears to be solved if you adjust the hand throttle so the
idle is above about 1500-2000 rpm.  In that case, the fuel flow
is never cut-off, and the engine never has to 'restart.'  Your
situation, where you need to keep the throttle lever on for
so long, isn't normal.

One way you can work around the problem without having to keep
the idle so high, is not put the clutch in until the rpms drop
below about 1500. As the car slows, you will actually feel when
the fuel flow begins.  The car will sort of perk up and momentarily
surge ahead.  On my cars I have to do that until everything is nice and
warm.  On one I just sold, I didn't.

Someone mentioned the Bosch book from Gus Pfister at Pacific Fuel Injection.
It's worthwhile if you plan on adjusting --even understanding--the MFI
system.  Likewise the Factory Manual pages are useful.

Hope this helps.
