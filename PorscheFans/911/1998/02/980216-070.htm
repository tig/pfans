Thaddeus wrote asking about Automotion's expandable oil return tubes.  I
installed
one of these recently in my '87.  The procedure was easy - crush and twist to
get
the old one out, then slip the new one in and expand it into place.  The
telescoping
joint in the center felt very loose, and I was not too suprised to find that
it leaked
at this center section.  The Automotion phone support fellow suggested that I
had installed the tube backwards (the larger tube is supposed to go into the
head).
Since I hadn't paid any attention to this detail, I accepted his explanation.
But
on second thought, the tube leaks with the engine off!  Orientation shouldn't
make any difference in this case.  Inspecting my installation, I found I had
done it 
"properly".

Anyone have good luck with these or other expandable return tubes?  My leak
now
hits the heat exchanger in addition to the garage floor :-(
