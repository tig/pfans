Hi Fans, I have some general questions that I'm sure you know the answers
to:

CV Joints:
Am planning to clean & repack the CV's soon.  The boots are still in VG
condition, no cracks or tears, but there are no clamps on them!  Just some
large tie-wraps holding the "open" end!  What kind of clamps should be
used?  Will hose clamps unbalance the axel shafts with the heavier screw
part?

Engine Bay Insulation:
I thought I would have the time to remove my engine to do this job in
March, but my schedule is looking packed and I'm signed up for Lime Rock
the first week of April.  Is it ok to just cut out the pad that is in there
until later in the spring when I have a few free weekends to do the job
right?  Or is it needed for heat protection, etc.?

Clutch Cable:
What is involved in replacing the clutch cable?  How long should I plan for
this job?  I have to at least adjust the one that is there.  I know the one
I have is ok for a little while, but I have already bought a new one since
I noticed the bellow on the existing one is torn up and the cable itself is
starting to show some age.  If it's a big job, I'll probably wait on that
as well.

Trailer Hitch:
I've been looking into putting a light duty (I estimate a total load of
about 500lbs) hitch on the 911 in order to haul tires, tools, and other
stuff to the track since I can't afford a trailer/tow vehicle in the near
future.  Anybody done this?  Any comments from the list?  I called U-Haul. 
They have a hitch that can handle 1000lbs and costs $176 over the counter
and $199 installed.  They said it is the only hitch available and requires
some drilling (probably in the bumper?) to mount.  Are there any other
options?  Is drilling as bad as it sounds?  I would definately mount it
myself if I went this route.

Waxing Wheels:
I have two sets of 16" fuchs alloys.  Is it ok to wax the annodized
centers?  If so, what kind of wax works well?

Thanks for the help.  I'm sure I can come up with other questions as well. 
I'll start with these.
