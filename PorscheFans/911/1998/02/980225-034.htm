OK Porsche fans... I've viewed your archives but haven't seen anything
relating to the items below, any ideas or help would be appreciated.  Car
is an '84 Targa, absolutely "cherry" with less than 25K.  Have had the
car for about 9 months, and now know what I've been missing over all
these years.  Questions are as follows:

1- Does anyone have an idea as to where the buzzer that indicates door is
open, seal belts not fastened is located?  I want to disconnect it since
it drives me nuts when I'm trying to listen to the radio or CD with the
doors open (as you know it takes a couple of hours to wash and detail the
thing).  I do not want to affect the rest of the "system", or to make an
irreversible fix.

2- The spring retainer pivot on the drivers side electric window
regulator broke a few weeks after I got the car.  Window still operates
fine, and my wrench suggested I run it till it breaks.   With my luck
it'll be in the middle of a thunderstorm and the window will be stuck in
"open".
The Automotion catalog carries replacement pivots, but they are either 23
or 26mm long.  The one that broke off is about 16mm.  Any ideas short of
replacing the entire regulator?

3- I'd like to install a footrest or "dead pedal" on the car.  The ones
I've seen advertised are for Coupes only, seems the Targa has more
structural support in the foot well area to compensate for the lack of a
regular roof.  Anyone have any ideas on my options?

4- Lastly, I'm looking for a used Targa top.  The one that's on the car
has never been folded, and I'd like to keep in pristine condition.  What
I'm looking for is something that I can store folded in the trunk, and
put on when I'm driving topless and the need arises.  Am not looking for
anything perfect, and will pay a "reasonable" price.  Obviously must fit
an 84 targa.

BTW- I've upgraded my A/C unit with the airflow improvement kit from
Zucs, dramatic improvement for 65 bucks.  The parts when they arrive
don't seem that they're worth the money, what you're paying for is the
engineering behind them and of course, for the results. 

thanx for the help.......
