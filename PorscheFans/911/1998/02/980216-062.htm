I tryed to answer 3 or so questions from various letters are once without a
copy of the original email.  Hope this works for you.

78 911 SC Targa Imperial Blue 

1.)   Colapsing Oil Return lines:

Added these to my 911 (78 SC owned since 1984 with 98K miles) about a year
ago.  They are relatively easy to install although on an SC it is a little
cramped to get them snug and takes some time.  Needed to add them after I
switched (like a Dummy) from 10-40 or 20-50 Castrol to a synthetic oil and an
additive with PTF compound.   After using these items I developed leaks
(somewhat serious) from the oil return lines.  Perhaps it was coincidence but
I'm back to good old castrol now.   The old return lines can be pulled out (I
cut mine in two with aviation snips first and then pulled them out).  Then the
colapsing guys go in and you use snap ring pliers to snug them up while
holding them in place with various angles of various sized screw drivers.  I
suspect that on an older (more mature) Porsche, without a caltalitic
converter, that the instalation might be easier.  A mechanic mentioned that
there are some spring loaded ones too.  These might work a little better than
the snap ring ones, but I don't know anyone who has used them.  The snap ring
ones don't leak too much although it might take an occasional tweak to get
them just right because believe it or not an oil/air cooled engine expands and
contracts some so the oil return lines might loosen some.  If you wanted pure
reliability get a Toyota (I have 2 Camrys, a 911, and 67 Datsun Roadster).

2.)  Removal of the infamous dust cap on the Front Wheels

Well the folks at Stuttgart obviously didn't want any dust getting to these
fine wheel bearings up front did they!   Since I like to play with the Porsche
as much as drive it I purchased a puller for the job.   It is a 3 jaw puller
from Posi Lock model 104 bearing and gear puller and I also got a slide hammer
attachment for it (already had the hammer weight from another tool though).
With the Posi Lock and a slide hammer I get the dust cap off in about 20
seconds or less.  The picture in the Haynes Manual and the Clymer manual show
some dude with two screw drivers!  I bet he would be there for hours trying to
get an SC cap off that way.  I'm sure there are other ways to get these caps
off, but none easier than with the posi lock puller.  Cost me about 118 $ for
this item (might find one cheaper though).

3.)  Shocks

I am about to replace the front shocks on my 911 SC.  I think (hope) that once
the struts are removed from the car that the shock inserts unscrew.  So in
answer to someones question:  Unscrew the cap from the strut once the strut is
outside of the car and replace the insert. I doubt that Bilstein or anyone
else will rebuild your shocks.  I am about to place KYBs on the front of my SC
(have had KYBs on the back for a long time with no complaints). Yes I know
that Japanese parts are inferior to German parts (Bilsteins and Konis) just
ask Mercedes about Lexus.  KYB received the Deming award for quality so they
must have something going for them.  I have placed Konis on 2 cars (VW super
beatle, and Datsun Roadster) and was pleased (but these shocks are not cheap).
I have placed KYBs on the Porsche an Audi Coupe and a Camry and have been
pleased with them (although I do not race the Porsche).   But for the price
(43$ a shock versus 125$ a shock I really wonder if the Bilstein is 3 times as
good). I have had a little vibration in the steering wheel for about 30 K
miles that I can't stand anymore.  I have new front tires that have been
carefully balanced for the 3rd time and I still get some intermitent
vibration. So its time for new front shocks, brake rebuild, maybe new wheel
bearings, possibly new ball joints  and perhaps a steering rack, but this
vibration is going down!   Maybe just new shocks and a brake rebuild and
possibly new wheel bearings will do the trick.  The most reasonable place I
have found for the shock prices is www.shockwarehouse on the internet.  

Not sure I followed the rules on providing information to porschefans.  Oh
well Enjoy the Ride!  Err well maybe that's the wrong car?   Porsche: the
legend, the stalion of Stuttgart there is no substitute.

Whatever...
