Hey Pfans,
I finally got my plugs out and I can now turn over the engine.Reading my
haynes manual.(worthless) And reading all my support mail(useful),I am
to understand that at the mark "z1" on the crank pulley I am at TDC for
cylinder one when it is pointed at mark on bottom of fan shroud.But my
problem now is if I am at "z1" shouldn't my royor button point at
cylinder wire one on the distributor cap?If I rotate the engine around
several times every time I was at "z1" the rotor button never pointed at
cylinder one. The engine had a complete rebuild just prior to sale,is it
possible to put the crank pulley on without lining up the "z1" with
cylinder one TDC? I don't know what I would do without you guys(girls if
applicable).
The last thing I want to do is crank this thing up and hear all my
valves bend.:-)

later,
 Shawn
