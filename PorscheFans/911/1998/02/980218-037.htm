My personal thoughts on Friday's message:

Brakes: Put in street pads, and the brakes will be smooth, powerful, and a
real pleasure to use. Race pads need to heat up to be effective - not the
thing for the emergency stops on the street. 

Power: After my '86 911 was wrecked, I drove several 87-89 cars, whcih all
seemed to have a flatness in the power band, rather than a real surge of power
as the engine came up on the cam  starting at 3500-4000 rpm. Most unlike my
'86. The '85 I would up buying had the same characteristics (it turned out it
had someone's clone chip in it).  I put in a Weltmeister chip and it
transformed the car. I can't say that top end power is significantly greater,
but the around town feel is greatly improved, and the "cammy"  surge of power
is back. A lot more fun to drive. 

US spec cars through '86 were chipped for 87 octane gas - perhaps this
wouldn't apply to a European-spec car. For me, I ran 91 octane gas anyway, so
the extra ignition advance from the new chip was no problem.

Oil Leaks: They all seem to leak a little. It's worse if you use synthetic
oil.

IMHO

GOOD LUCK!
