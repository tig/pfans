Dick,

The cruise control amplifier is located in the trunk behind the dash
next to the brake master cylinder.  You have to remove 5 10mm bolts to
get the panel off; it's an aluminum box about 1X4X6.

I have a good spare if you find you need one.  My S.O. has an '81, and
her cruise control doesn't work either.  I've haven't had the time to
sleuth out the problem yet, but swapping the amplifier was my first
step.
