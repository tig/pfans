Dave,

I installed a new top because I wanted to change the color from blue to black. No other reason.
I did a lot of research. Tops installed for 993's are about $1600 to $2000 depending who does it and 
whose after market top you use ($1600 at Cactus installed - 415.339.1323). Most shops use GAHH products they 
have a good and long standing reputation v. one off shops like World Upholstery or Auto International (whose 
products may be good but who do not have the experience generated by producing a GAHH volume of tops). 
For other 911's the price should be cheaper but about the same. GAHH makes tops, carpet kits etc. 
for every car you can think of and in just about any material or color. The top was about $1450 retail in German 
canvas from GAHH including sewn in window and a new headliner (installation was $150 plus I let Cactus take the 
markup on wholesale on the top -  if you buy direct or negotiate with your local installer you can get at least 15% off 
the price of the top). Top installation is even easier on the 993 than on the earlier 911's -  but don't do it yourself!!.
The tops are just about as good as Porsche but do not have the padded seal at the rear bottom corners which 
helps with fit at that point - I don't think its that big of a deal personally - its barely noticeable. 
However, considering that the cheapest Porsche top I could find 
was $2100 for just the skin, window is about $450 and headliner $350 plus the fact that only Porsche can install 
a Porsche top as they use a special electric current method to seal the glue (the windows are glued in not sewn 
and the machine to do it with is about $3500 and that's its only purpose in life so no one else would ever buy 
one - to install expensive factory windows in expensive factory tops on model 993's only) and they charge 
about 10hrs at $85 an hour so $850 to install. After market tops can be installed in 3 to 4 hours.

Hope this helps.

Regards

Thanks, Mark, I found their ad.

Do you recall what the price breakout was for the top?

Was the quality equal to factory?

Howcum a top replacement so early on your 96?

Dave
