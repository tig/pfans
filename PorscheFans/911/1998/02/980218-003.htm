Hi Kerry, yer kindly ol' Unka Bart here is having a bit of a problem
reconcilling what he reads here, especially after checking out that
splendid web page of yours (My compliments on that, btw).

What was it that the old lady on the bus told you...?  Get it, lass!

But first a word about the Speedster being too beatiful to get muddy.  It's
a Porsche, m'dear, drive the bloody thing and wash the mud off when you get
done, for mercy's sake.

There, there; buy the Speedster even if you have to pay for the whole
thing.  You don't *really* need me or any one else to tell you that, now do
you?  NSXs are really lovely cars, but... in the humble mendicant's view,
there simply is no substitute...

Take him with you and let him drive the Speedster when you go to buy it.
Chances are he'll be happy to shed the NSX, but maybe you would be better
off with 100% of the porker and 50% of the Audi, assuming, that is, that
he's astute enough to make sure that the Audi's a Quattro.  And on that
score, kindly allow me to invite you both to join the Quattro list also.

By jove, I do believe that there's an echo in here.  You really *do* know
what you need to do, now don't you...?

Yer kindly ol' Unka Bart
