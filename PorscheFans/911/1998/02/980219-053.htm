Fans:
    First of all, I'd like to say a big THANKS to everyone that has
given me advice on the rebuilding of my front brake calipers. You guys
have saved me alot of time and grief.
    OK, the next problem I'm having is there seems to be a blockage in
the caliper. I removed the pistons using a grease gun. Now I am cleaning
the caliper in my parts washer and I'm trying to remove all the grease
and am making sure the passages are clear and clean.  I can't get
cleaning fluid to run thru one side (side away from the bleed screw). I
know I shouldn't split the caliper. I've also used a bike pump and tried
to blow out the blockage, but to no avail. I don't think it's grease
blocking the way, since I've had it in my parts washer for hours. I'm
thinking it might be something else causing the blockage. It might have
been blocked for a long time.
    Anyone have any ideas or suggestions? I'm sure someone out there has
experienced the same problem. I'm kinda at a loss here. Any thoughts
would be appreciated.
