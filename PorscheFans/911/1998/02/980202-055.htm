Hi all,

Yesterday's post about 993 tires goaded me into sharing a tidbit I
learned during a chance conversation with a Michelin tire engineer and
test driver who worked with Porsche on the development and approval of
the Michelin MXX3.

He said that the factory inflation pressures listed on the driver's door
are a compromise for safe running at *maximum speed*. He voluteered that
except for the very few of us who actually cruise at 160+ MPH, the rear
tread life can be extended on the MXX3 by lowering the rear pressures by
..2 bar for the 2.5 bar tires and .3 bar for the 3.0 bar tires. (He is
French so has not learned to speak in lbs/sq in, but I think that works
out to 40 lbs instead of 44 and 33 lbs instead of 36.)

NOTE: HE SAID THIS WAS FOR THE MXX3 ONLY. Every tire is different and
doing the same with another tire may be dangerous. He also said, if I
were to pass this around "only to my Porsche friends" :-), I should
emphasize that this was not a recommendation by Michelin or himself, but
something that each driver should decide individually. 

For myself, I will lower the pressure on the road and consider changing
it for the track, based on tire behaviour and pyrometer readings.
