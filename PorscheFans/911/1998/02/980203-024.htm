P-Fans:

Left work and the car would not start.  Engine was cold (I live in
Boston).  All I got was a high pitch whine and medium speed clicking.
It did not sound like it was turning the engine at all.  It had started
just fine in the morning.  I push started it and drove home without any
problems.  I checked the voltage at the battery when it was running and
got about 14.5v.  I stopped the car and turned it off on a hill next to
my house.  Waited a few minutes and tried to start again.  Same thing
happened.  Checked the Bat. and got 12.6v.  Bat is a new Optima 3 mos.
old.  Checked all fuses and none were toasted.

My suspects are:

	1.  Starter
	2.  Starter solenoid

Tonight I will check the starter voltages with ignition off and then on.
How does one check a starter solenoid for proper operation?  It looks
like the starter and solenoid are just one unit.

At the moment I am preparing to get a new starter or rebuild the old
one.  A friend said I could take it to autopalace and they would test it
for me to see if it works.  If I have to replace it has anyone tried the
'High Torque Starter" listed in Automotion's cat #16  p 114 or similar
advertised elsewhere?

And, how can I get the damn thing out with the transmission IN?  Looks
like I will be having a lot of fun this weekend!

Thanks in advance!

-Michael
