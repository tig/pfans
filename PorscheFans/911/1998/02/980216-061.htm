Joe,

I used clean brake fluid to lubricate the piston before inserting it back
into the caliper.  I carefully slid it in a bit by hand, then rotated to set
the orientation of the "step" where it had to be.  Then, I used a metal
plate and a C-clamp to "pull" it back into the caliper.  As long as the
C-clamp is centered, it should go right in.  Mine went in with practically
no effort.  I wish they came out as easy as they went in.

I used some fine Scotch-Brite (the green plastic looking stuff) to polish
the pistons before putting them back in.  They came out perfectly clean with
no scratches.  I also did the inside of the caliper a bit to make sure that
was clean too.
