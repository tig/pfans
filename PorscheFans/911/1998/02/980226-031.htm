Ross,

The rule of thumb I've always used: With the car on the ground and 
settled, look at the attitude of the A-Arms.  If they are parallel to the 
ground or pointing down slighty at the outer end, you are okay.  If the 
are pointed up at all at the outer end, you need to install rack spacers.

You may well be right about US vs. ROW ride heights, since the 
suspensions are all the same; and they can't BOTH be what Porsche 
intended.
