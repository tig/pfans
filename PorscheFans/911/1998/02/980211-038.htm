Bill,

Thanks for the lengthy comment concerning the problems I've been having
with my Bosch MFI.  I agree with what you have to say about the system -
it is wonderful and I, personally, would never go to carbs.  I had a 914
that the previous owner converted to carbs and no amount of work on
my part could ever get the mixture right for all driving circumstances!!

Maybe I didn't describe my symptoms exactly right - The car will idle
all
day long at the correct rpm's; however, when coasting to a stop with the
clutch pushed in, the revs drop like a rock and the engine dies.  This can
be corrected by leaving the hand throttle up just a tad until the oil temp
shows 180.  Even when hot, I notice the same "drop like a rock" symptom,
but the engine usually catches after hitting rock bottom and the idle comes
back to 1000(normal).  I read a previous thread about the RPM-transducer
and throttle shutoff valve and how they work.  I'm starting to think that
it doesn't quite know when to start the flow of gas back to my motor.   Does
this make sense??
