Hi Pholks,

I am in the process of devarnishing a 1970 911E.  This car has set for a 
number of years and varnish has accumulated through out the fuel system.  

I had to open the electric fuel pump.  It was full of varnish. Here are a
few things I've  learned:

Mark the end plate, intermediate plate, and motor body for correct reassembly!
Make sure that the small rollers are in their original slots and in their
original position!
 
I learned some more important things after losing one of the "O" rings.

Get help from a good machine shop that has experience in rebuilding hydraulic
systems.

The electric fuel pump uses two different size "O" rings.  The outer one is
36mm. OD and the inner one is 35mm. OD  In trying to replace the original
"O" rings with ones that are "close", you have maybe two choices. Too
large and too small.  When replacing "O" rings in a surface seal
installation as this one, the OD fitment is preferred by the hydraulic
repair business.  

The "O" rings that are going to be tried:
Outer (universal #027) : 1 5/16" X 1 7/16" X 1/16"
Inner  (universal #026) : 1 1/4" X 1 3/8" X 1/16"

Using these "O" rings will give me a "crush" of at least .010"   This allows 
the end plate to firmly seat against the intermediate plate. If you must,
hand lap the intermediate plate lightly. Do not remove a lot of metal,
just polish the surface to insure a good seal.  Do it with fine lapping
compound on a sheet of glass to insure a perfectly flat surface.

Good luck with your projects.
