Luther Wilson - come to the Rocky Mountain Region tech session at Tom
Conway's Carquip up in Boulder this Saturday and find me or someone
who knows lots more than I do to ask about this.  Tom of course would
be happy to sell you a used ignition switch, since used P parts are his
business.  See the region's website via PCA.org.  But I doubt heavy
keychains led to your problems - they tend just to make the switch not
want to turn or otherwise malfunction mechanically, not electrically, I
think.

My suggestion for battery drain problems and starter problems is usually
to do some measuring with voltmeters and ammeters. If, for instance,
you only have an intermittent small milliamp drain from battery with key
off, it is probably only the clock, and your problem is with the starter, not
something draining the battery.  Ditto if battery has same voltage after
being fully charged and sitting a while, it hasn't drained.  The starter and
solenoid when cold and old just may need more voltage (which your
charger supplies, since in order to charge a battery you need more
voltage going in than battery sends out) because things aren't working
quite right and the higher voltage gets through whatever corrosion or
wear or whatever is causing a higher resistance (reverse sometimes
seems to be the case - won't start when  hot, starts when cold -
gremlins at work).  Measuring voltage at starter and comparing to voltage
at battery can give you some useful clues sometimes, like resistance in
connections.

Or, if you find quite a current draw with ignition off, you can start pulling
fuses to see when it changes.  Or see if pulling the battery wire off of
the ignition switch changes things.  Etc.
