Hi P-fans,

I am looking for the cover plate that protects the steering rack on the
underside of car. It is for a 71E(although several different years would
fit). Anyone out there have such an item that they may want to part with
for a reasonable price? If it had the two small bolts for the front
mounting that would be a plus(saves me from searching for metric bolts).
E-mail me direct at brambo@cet.com  thanks in advance.

Also my $.02 concerning radar detectors. The Valentine one is the way to
go. We have done some (unoffical) comparisons in our group with guys that
have escorts and others and the Valentine outperforms in terms of range,
sensitivity, filtering false alarms, etc. A bit spendy but worth it when
one considers the cost of getting caught when performing the low level
flying that tends to happen when enjoying these cars. 

no connection here...just one satisfied customer.
