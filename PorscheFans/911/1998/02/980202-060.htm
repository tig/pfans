Hi Greg.  I have an 86 with 66K miles on it.  Last week I was in traffic
through a parking lot (local event).  After about 15 minutes mine started a
similar "surge" as you described.  Mine went up to around 1500 and then back
to idle (800), but would do that repeatedly 3 or 4 times (real quickly). 
Luckily right about that time I had some open road (ok well 200 feet before I
parked) and it was idling fine and didn't do that again.  I hasn't done it
since (drove it able 200 miles on Saturday without any problem).

If you find out anything please let me know.
