Hi "Player":

  Just one more opinion to consider when you decide to improve the
performance of your SC,......................

There is very little one can do to a CIS-equipped 911 such as your 78
SC.
Exhaust system changes result in 18-20 HP improvements but beyond that,
any meaningfull gains require a different induction system that will
allow performance camshafts as well as additional airflow. The CIS
systems has great drivability but HP gains are hard to some by on these
engines unless you go for displacement increases, ie, 3.0 litres to 3.5
litres. Making 250HP from a 3.0 CIS engine is very, very difficult.

For power increases with drivability, the 3.2 Motronic engine from a
Carrera
is a better place to start, IMHO. This system allows modest camshaft
changes and the software allows the adaptability of some intake flow
improvements, compression increases, and exhaust upgrades. The 3.2
Carrera engine has heads that flow much better in stock form than any of
the CIS versions.
If your budget allows, you can also make displacement increases to this
engine, as well!

This seems to be a great combination of drivability and power without
the hassles of not being able to pass emissions testing, depending upon
which changes are made.

Installing Weber carburetors will allow other changes to be made,
however if they do emissions testing in your area, you will not be able
to pass any tests. The Webers do make throttle response that is simply
not available in any CIS or street-type Motronic FI. You can also use
some camshafts that wouldn't be compatible with the above FI systems.

Hope this gets you thinking,................
