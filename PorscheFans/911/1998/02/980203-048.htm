Greetings,

I'm having a problem with a vibratory noise that is coming from the right
front corner of the car ('84 Targa 116k ). What I notice is that after about
10-15 minutes of driving and things are warmed up, if the brakes are applied
and the car is stopped when I move forward again there is a rather loud medium
pitched vibration that comes from the right front wheel area.

This can be duplicated with the car jacked-up and the suspension slightly
loaded or not, by turning the wheel slowly by hand. The rotors, pads and hoses
are brand new and the wheel bearings inspected and repacked (it did it before
the new parts were installed and in fact it may now be a little louder)

The only thing I can figure is that this signals a worn caliper. Thanks in
advance for a confirmation of my diagnosis or any other ideas.
