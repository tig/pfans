ANDY:

Before you look into replacing/rebuilding the transmission, please take
the time to examine you're shift linkage.  My fathers 1983 911-SC has
just under 100K miles on it.  He was experiencing many of the symptoms
you mention above.  This past fall I completely dis-assembled the shift
linkage, replaced all plastic bushings and properly tightended all
fasteners (used loctite).  I also had to repair the shift rod itself -
there was a little "play" in the front of the bar where the "nose piece"
of the rod is "crimped" on to the rod itself - had to use pop rivits to
repair this. 

The transformation in the shifting on this 911 was AMAZING!!  I never
knew it could shift so well.  It is now apparent that there never was a
problem with the transmission itself - only the linkage.  

To check your linkage, remove the access cover at the rear of the center
tunnel.  Hold the rod that comes out of the transmission as best as you
can with the fingers of one hand.  Use you're other hand to slowely move
the gear lever side to side and front to back.  If there is any
perceptable play, you should investigate to see where in the shift
linkage it is coming from.  

A final note:  in all 911-SC's (and others as well) you can experience a
"Clunk" or a grinding when moving the lever into first.  I have found
that the best way to avoid this is to move the lever into second gear
just prior to throwing it into first.  Also, it helps if you can afford
to take you're time and ease it into first.  This is an inherant trait
of this transmission.  Nothing will fix it...you just need to know how
to use it.
