The only time I seen a 911 idling that way is when the ignition timing
is set too far ahead (or advanced too much.)  It gets worse as
temperature rises therefore, after a nice cool ride it might not do it
too bad but during slow trafic or a couple of 0 to 60 drags it would
show up again.

Try manually retarding the ignition timing a little bit and see if it
does it again.  Nevertheless, I recommend you have the timing check and
adjusted proffesionally.

Let me know how it turns out.
