Hi John -

Motorcycle shops sell, or at least used to sell, nifty little devices
that clamp over the end of a cable and allow you to inject the lube of
your choice through the length of the cable from a spray can.  This IMHO
is a very satisfying way to lube a cable (you'll see lube actually
squirt out of the other end of the cable)... especially compared with
trying to drip lube into the top end and hoping that gravity pulls it
down into the cable.  Take the clutch cable with you since (IIRC) its
fittings are bigger than your usual motorcycle cable fittings.

As for lube, I've tried many.  White lithium is good, Wurth HHS2000 is
better, and my personal favorite is motorcycle o-ring chain lube (guess
what my background is).  The latter is a high pressure lube that's
compounded in a solvent carrier to flow and penetrate, then dry to a
viscous moly grease.  Any of 'em will work fine, it's just my personal
opinion that chain lube gives the silkiest "feel" ... kind of a big
issue when operating antique motorcycle drum brakes... but hey, that 911
clutch mechanism needs all the help it can get too ;-)
