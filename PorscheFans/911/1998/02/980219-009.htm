I bought a short shift kit for my early 911S during the Automotion sale last
week and went ahead and picked up the ball cup and shift rod coupling bushings
as well, figuring I might as well renew them while I'm in there.  Turns out
the ball cup was fine, but every other bushing in the linkage was shot-
totally disintegrated!  Maybe that's why my shifting had become so flaky
lately, eh?

Anyway, the replacement of all the other bushings looks straightforward
enough, but the shift coupling bushings must be inserted into the yoke from
the inside out, it appears, which must mean that the big pin on the shift rod
that forms the T that goes  inside the yoke must be removed, correct?  Is it a
press-fit dowel?  Do I need a hydraulic press to get it out and back in, or
can I just use a hammer and block of wood?  Since it only moves back and forth
and twists, it doesn't look like fit is that critical, except that you
wouldn't want it to fall out.  Any tips for me before I tackle this? I've read
the shop manuals and they don't mention it, and the parts book doesn't even
show the bushings as a separate part, only the entire coupling is listed.

Has anyone else tried the "lockout springs" for the shift plate sold by
Automotion which are supposed to stop accidental mis-shifts from happening?
Do they really work? Any negative aspects?  They require re-drilling the
compression spring rod holes 1/2 inch inside the stock locations, which I
didn't understand when I bought them, I though they were just higher
compression springs. 

Thanks for any help. E-mailed responses appreciated.

Have any of the U.K. list members used SouthBound Trimmers ?  If so, do
they do a good job ?  How close to the original look will their
re-trimmed seats etc be ?  In my car the seats have sagged to the extent
that I am sitting on the seat rails and whilst having the seats re-built
I am thinking up upgrading from vinyl to either a vinyl/cord or leather
cover.

Are there any other recommended retrimmers out there ?

Thanks,

Ian.
