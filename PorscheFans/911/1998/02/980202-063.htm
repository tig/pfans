Three questions for someone more informed than me:

1) On a '87 Euro Targa, the speedometer functions quite happily but only as
long as rpm remains above 3000.  During deceleration the speedo needle drops
to zero and the odometer stops increasing as soon as rpm drops below that
value. Ideas? It is an electronic unit.
2) The car came with 15"Fuchs rims and would likely have had 215/60 rears
and 195/65 fronts at delivery.  I get the impression from these pages that
lower profile tires are more common now. If so, is there a general consensus
on an appropiate size for daily driving?  If these are indeed an
improvement, why were they not fitted by the factory as original equipment?
3) One of the option codes on the delivery slip is 348.  Anyone know what
that is? It's not listed in Bruce A.'s book.

Thanks for any help...
