Well, I've been looking at a 1990 Carrera 4 5sp for the past
two weeks.  Price started at $35,900 and is down to $29,500.
It's got 60k on the clock.  Already had the 60k service
too.  I was told the distributor was updated to
one with a vent to help reduce wear on the belt.  The
distributors look clean...is there any way to tell(ie
where is the vent)?

Today I inspected the car at the same dealer by their
claimed "Porsche expert mechanic".  Well, he certainly
seemed to know what he was talking about, but didn't
seem to have much experience with the C4.  We pulled
the rear two, middle, front, and fuel pump covers off
and looked around.  The motor looked fairly clean except
for some oil on the passenger side that looked new.  The
mechanic pointed out a hose on the oil tank that they
had a problem with(and was still leaking!).  The oil on
that side appeared to be from that leak.  However the drivers
side seemed to have some oil residue on the two rear
cylinders and looked like it was from either the bottom
valve covers or possibly the front cam cover.  The head
to cylinder joint looked clean still.  Would a compression
test confirm that?  Up top looked very clean...no oil.

The other leak was up front behind the front diff.  The
torque tube looked clean, but there's a metal piece just
in front and lower than it...looked like a rubber mount
with a metal bracket and big bolt in the middle of it.
The grease/oil seemed to be leaking around it.  The mechanic
figured it was a main seal in the back of the front diff.
Is this very difficult to repair?  Otherwise the front
diff looked clean...no leaks around it or the shafts.

I've heard many different sides to this story though...
"Never by a wet Porsche", and "Oil leak...Yep, that's
a Porsche".  However I've seen many dry 911's.  I've
read the "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook", but it didn't
really detail oil leaks or conditions.  This one was
not very wet...nothing was dripping, but there was
some oil on it here and there.  I see alot more oil
on my '85 Toyota Supra...so it's not very alarming...but
I don't know the C4 very well.

Another thing...the cover for the fuel pump was badly
rusted, although it appeared the body underneath was very
clean...the paint on the top of the fuel pump cover helped!
It all flaked off when we removed it, but it did insulate
the body from the rust.  Is this common?

And, I noticed some parts of the bottom of the engine
were somewhat oxidized.  The oil return tubes looked
solid, but had some of the common aluminum oxidation.
The cylinders had a little too.  I guess I was expecting
a nice and shiny motor.

Something else that was funny...I noticed some overspray
of matching red paint on the very back of the underside
of the rocker panels.  It's black underneath as usual,
except for some red just in front of the rear wheels.
I didn't notice any damage or repair to the body of the
car.  Any ideas?

As it goes, they are sitting at $29,500.  I believe they
would take $27k.  Is it worth it or should I offer lower.
I am going to have the car inspected by an independent
shop...but only after figuring the worth in it's current
known condition.

BTW, the body seems to be in great shape with no dings
or paint problems('cept the underside of the rockers).
There didn't appear to be any major repairs.  The interior
was spotless except for a little minor wear on the drivers
seat bottom left side bolster...probably meaning alot of
in and out...maybe more city miles than highway.

Man is that motor shoehorned in there!!

I also test drove a stock '88 911 Turbo.  Little
less than normal acceleration from 1-3k, then bam
you're at 6k.  Now I know why everybody said the
turbo can get you into trouble...big boost!  Shifting
was interesting...car really flung you forward when
you let the clutch in at 5500rpm.  I think I'll take
the 964...seems easily(but expensively) modded to 300hp.
And much safer until I really learn to drive the 911.

Thanks guys!  Sorry this was so long!
