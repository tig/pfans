I'd also like to recommend Rod Birch's box.  I bought one for my 86 Targa last
week.  The box fits great, the carpet matches exactly and it sounds
incredible.  The bass really fills the car and helps balance the mids and
highs.  Rod was very helpful and even drove a few hours out of his way to meet
with me and save me the shipping costs.  And a few days later when I
discovered I needed the 8 ohm subs instead of the 4 ohm, he met me again and
didn't charge anything to swap them.  He also answered all my technical
questions and helped me figure out the best way to wire my amp.

I highly recommend this enclosure if you are planning to add subs to your car.
 Prior to the custom box, I was using a Kicker "tube" which sound ok, but
nothing compared to the sound and feel I get out of this custom enclosure.
