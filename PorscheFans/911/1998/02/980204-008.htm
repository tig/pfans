I have a 76 911S Targa.
It only has 87000 miles on it.
It is starting to show signs of rust.
I think it is worth repairing because the interior is excellent and the
mileage is fairly low.
The rust has started where some fresh asphalt gravel mix stuck up in the
wheel wells and retained moisture.
The previous owner did not monitor the under body very well.
During this repair the rocker panels will need to be replaced, those I
can find.
The rear quarter panels right behind the lower corner of the doors and
possibly up front by the targa bar are going to.
Does anybody make these repair panels or is it easier to buy salvaged
quarters.
How much are salavaged quarters?
If I am going to replace the whole quaters I would just as soon replace
with SC quarters.
How much do those go for?
It could be cheaper just by a newer car but this car is too nice to
junk.
