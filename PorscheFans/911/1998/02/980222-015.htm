Walt,

The most likely candidate for your symptom is breakage of the inner
handle
door clip, a little white plastic bushing that fits into the interior
door release
handle.  The rod you refer to presses down into this bushing, and
connects
the release mechanism to the handle.  Look at the other side release
handle
and compare the two.  These bushings are readily available from
Automotion,
Performance Products, etc., for about $1.25.  If this is the problem,
just get a
new bushing, snap it into the lever, and reconnect the rod by pressing
it
securely into the bushing.  This can be done without any door panel
disassembly.

Note that there are many of these in the door opening linkage, so the
problem
may be a bit more complicated, and will require the panel to be
disassembled to look for other broken bushings, springs, etc.  BTW, if
you have the Haynes book, this mechanism is shown in Chapter 10,
Section 11.

Hope this helps.
