Michael - you ask:

	1.  White scum/spooge had collected all around the inside of the
cap and pipe.
I think this is oil emulsified with water, air, or both, and collects up there
as a sort of condensate.  Maybe time to change oil?  Or if it is pretty
new, maybe not, just a humid time of year.  Wipe it off in any case.
	2.  When the cap was removed it sounded like the engine was
having a hard time maintaining the idle.  I think the RPMs dropped by
about 	100 and returned to normal when the cap was replaced.
Is this normal or not?
It is normal.

Also, I have an '82 with a Momo aftermarket steering wheel.  After I
make a turn the turn signals do not shut off.  I was wondering if this
is because:

	1.  I have an aftermarket wheel & hub.
	2.  That feature was not around when the car was made.
	3.  Something is broken.

Porsche has had self-canceling signals since I don't know when, back in
the 356 days.  My Momo (or maybe someone else's) hub has the right
provision for canceling.  Maybe yours doesn't (hard to fathom, though),
or wasn't installed properly, or something is broken.  Pull the wheel and
inspect things.  The hub should have grooves or flanges or the like
which interact with the stalk to do the canceling.  Since you can install
the hub in as many positions as there are splines on the shaft, and can
install the wheel on the hub in 6 positions, some care is needed to install
the hub properly for cancelling.  Center your tires before pulling the
wheel.  If the hub was mispositioned, you may have to remove the wheel
from the hub and reposition it also so you have the wheel more or less
centered when you are done.

Note that the makers of light metal aftermarket hubs caution us not to use
too much torque on the nut.  I forget the spec, but less than factory.  I've
never had a problem with my hub coming loose at their spec.
