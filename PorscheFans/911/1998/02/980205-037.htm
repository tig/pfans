These are definitely show stopping cars generally garnering top marks in
people's choice concours.  Mine, while being an 89 shares several items with
your prospective purchase.  The first thing that you need to consider is
that this is definitely a fair weather car.  The convertible top is what
Porsche describes as an emergency cover.  And hopefully the emergency is not
a monsoon.   If I travel, I generally make arrangements for the car to be
garaged overnight in case of inclement weather.  Automotion and others sell
a half cover which has served me well the few times that the car was parked
out of doors in the rain.  Next you need to consider that the unique
replacement parts are exorbitantly expensive.  For example if you need to
replace that back fiberglass toneau cover, the cheapest used one that I have
seen is $2200 and it needed some work.  The convertible top cover from
Porsche lists at something like $2600 and that is the fabric, not the rails,
not the hard parts, just the fabric.  I have been quoted $1500 to install a
new top.  I just replaced a convertible latch, price $140.  The windshield,
the doors, the side windows are all unique parts and are hard to find and
are very expensive.  On the other hand, when I drive this car there is a
sense of exhilaration and thrill that I have never experienced before or
since, and I have owned 6 Porsches and now own 2 Mercedes.  Truly these
unique automobiles are, in one sense, the state of the automotive art that
existed at the time and at the same time, a  throw back to the 1950's.  Be
prepared for oohs, and awwhs and people standing around your car.  They just
look and present that good.  The day you buy it you will be happy and I'm
guessing that in 20 years you will be just as happy if not more so.  Prices
have been running from about $46,000 to $52,000 for both 89 and 94 models
and with the low mileage and fixing the back cover, assuming the top is
pristine (check the stitching) yours seems to be a fair price. Good Luck.
