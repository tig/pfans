John,

I rebuilt mine for about $150 and one Saturday.  The results are good
though not factory and very the experience was very rewarding.  I also
learned about the top design so that I have been able to stop almost all
leaks in the car.  Now a small towel on the seat catches the occasional
drip during the 8 inches of rain we've had in the past 3 weeks.

I think based on this, the $500+ that some of the people charge is quite
high unless you have problems with the basic hardware that you need them to
fix (e.g., latches and pins).  Some on the list have used local upholstery
shops who charged about $300.

Good luck, that is only 30,000 pennies.
