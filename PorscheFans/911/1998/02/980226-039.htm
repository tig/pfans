To the listmember pondering replacing the dash in his '85 911 (sorry, I
left your email address at work), here is the step by step process as best
I can remember it....

To remove the windshield is no big deal;  thereare two approaches,
depending on whether you want to use a new gasket, or re-use the old one.

Approach #1
Cut the old gasket out. This involves getting a carpet knife, and
cutting the gasket lip on the outside off all the way around. You will
have to remove the trim from the gasket...be VERY careful not to bend it,
it serves a very important function, and is expensive ($75.00 per half) to
replace. Anyhow, once the outer lip is removed, gently push out the
windshield with your palms from the inside, into the waiting hands of an
assistant. Removing the rear view mirror helps. You will need to buy a
new gasket for later installation, and a word of advice here from someone
who did it wrong the first time....buy your gasket DIRECTLY from Porsche.
DO NOT buy an after market one, they are thinner and will not seat
properly. The Porsche one's are only $65.00 or so.

Approach #2
Get a "hook tool" (like the window installers have), it has a
screwdriver handle, and a round shaft the has a 90 degree bend on the end.
This is used from the inside of the car to gently go around the gasket,
moving the inside lip to the outside. Once the gasket is moved over the
metal lip of the car frame, you can gently pop the windshield out, as in
the first method. Do not remove the trim if you elect to go this route,
the windshield/gasket/trim assembly stays intact, and can be re-installed
as-is. WARNING, this is a delicate operation, and is best done by
professionals (IMO). Winshield breakage is a real possibility here. A
glass guy coming to your home (at least around here) cost $40.00 or so
dollars, and a windshield costs $200-$300; your call.

Installing for both methods requires a hook tool, as well as rosin coated
cord. You put the gasket on the glass, install the trim, lay the cord
around the glass in the gasket channel, and put the glass on the car. From
the inside, gently pull the cord out around the glass. This pulls the lip
of the gasket from the outside of the car to the inside. Use the hook tool
as necessary to help out. The glass must be centered, and the trim ring
MUST BE IN PLACE before the glass is reinstalled. It acts as a gasket
spreader, and will not fit into its' groove if the windshield is already
installed. It is necessary for proper winshield seal. Get a tube of that
black windshield sealer goop, and lay a bead of it around the outside of the
windshield under the gasket lip. You are done.

I went the first route, as my old gasket was looking a little worse for
wear and tear. When installation time came, I called a glass guy, and he
re-installed it for $45.00. Hook tool, cord, and sealant were too much
trouble for me, when a pro with experience and tools was available for so
little. Again, your call.

Buy the dash first, and the bolt studs are self evident (tip, if the dash
is to be dyed, do it before installation). 

Also, there are about six nylon posts that hold the dash down into the
subframe. These cost about 40 cents each from the Porsche dealer. Have a
handful on hand.

You will need a minimum of an 8mm socket, driver, various extensions, a
universal joint, and a flashlight. A cresent wrench comes in handy, as
does small hands. A wife/girlfriend is an excellent tool for this job; If
you don't have one, go get one...8^) 

Open the front boot, and remove the hardboard bulkhead. From inside the
car, remove the steering wheel, and pop out all of the guages (I left mine
dangling by the wires). Also, GENTLY pry out the A/C vent, if you have
one. It is only press-fit into the plenum. 

Remove the bolts from wherever you can reach them; Some from the boot and
some from the guage holes. They may be nylon treaded, and never come
"loose". You will probably need to use the wrench or socket until they
come off of the studs. Mine were nylon, but the ones from the wreck my
donor dash came from were not. 

From right to left, there is one stud on the left corner, one on the right
side of the instrument cluster, two more after the A/C vent, and one in the
right corner of the dash (Going by memory, I may have missed one).  There
are two more holding the top of the dash down to the frame.

Windshield removal was about 15 minutes, dash R&R was about 1 1/2 to 2
hours. Glass guy re-installed the glass in about 30 minutes. This job was
easier to do than it sounds, and saved me a bundle of dough.

To recap:

Buy the gasket, nylon posts, and dash. Assemble tools. Dye dash (if
necessary), remove window, remove dash, install new dash, call glass guy.
$230 total for me (I got an EXCELLENT price on my dash; $125.00). Gasket
was $65.00, and the glass guy was $45.00. I had to wait two days for his
schedule to free up, so I drove the wife's car.

Hope this helps,

John D.
