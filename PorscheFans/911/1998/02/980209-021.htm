Hey p-people,

Recently I was reading thru the postings and someone asked about an SC base
3.0 litre motor w/ GE 60 or GE40 cams for the street.  I was hoping to see
some feedback.......So does anyone out there have any experience with this
setup.  I am already committed to my project which will be a 3.0 w/ Elgin Mod
S cams (same grind as GE 60 I believe)  and my car is to be a
street/autox/time-trial and driver ed. car to just have some fun
with.(possibly develop to a club racer later)      Were shooting for the mid
9's for compression and weber 40's w/ PMO tall stacks and SSi w/ sport
muffler.   I am not trying to go and compete w/ the guys who can outspend me
and would like to here from anyone who has run a similar set-up.

Thanks, J. Zittrer
