Kerry, if you haven't bought the 911 yet, and if you can afford it, then go
for it!    Forget this 'halfsies stuff'.

I own an '88 911 turbo, and for me, there is no other car!  (Well, when I
haul kids around or go to the Price Club, I have to admit, I take my
Trooper.  I don't share her either.)  I love the power!  They will have to
bury me in her, as I am never giving her up!

I have never driven a NSX or a 944, but I used to own a ZR-1 'vette, and in
the beginning, it was normal for me to compare the turbo to the 'chebby'.
She has no chips, (she goes 100mph with the pedal half-way down, so I guess
I don't need them,  she has 2 mods, everything else is factory).  She
doesn't have 6-speeds, (I initially frowned at 4, but I adjusted
immediately.)  She doesn't have power steering, (I discovered rather quickly
that if I concentrate on something else besides my driving, she will stray
into the next lane at the blink of an eye, so I miss it less than I thought
I would.)  The 'vette was fun to drive, but I would never attempt to
parallel park it.  I just couldn't gauge the end of the car.

I shared the 'vette with my husband.  I share PoorShe with nobody.  Maybe it
is mental, but there is a big difference when you do not have to readjust
the seat from another driver's body.  Female or male, the  seat of a 911
hugs the body and tells you to start the ignition and take off!

Be satisfied with your decision, as it will be the right one for you.  Good
luck!
Get some sleep.
