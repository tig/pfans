I am having a problem with a door stay on my '86 Targa.  The driver's
side stay seems weak since it offers no resistance to opening, and has no
intermediate stop point. So I ordered a new one, installed it and the
door wouldn't close.  It would move maybe a half inch and then stop. The
door would not budge!  So, I assumed the part was defective and returned
it for replacement.  Well, the next one I got did the same thing!  I've
put the original stay back in and the door closes fine.  Has anyone run
across anything like this?  The parts all look identical.

I did notice that the passenger's side stay, which appears original, is
different.  The arm is made of two pieces sandwiched together, while on
the driver's side the arm is one piece.  I have a feeling that the
driver's side stay has been replaced before.
