I need some help, can someone give some input? 

I have a 1985 911 Carrera/Targa (European version) with a idle problem.
The symptoms are as follows:
1.When at a stand still Idle is fine.
2.When I apply the gas it will rev up normally. 
3.When the engine is reving down it will stick at 2000 rpm for several
seconds then drop below 700 rpm and lope back to 12 to 1500 rpm before
settling down to a normal idle at about 800 rpm. 
4.On ocassion the engine will stall and shut down when the low rpm
"lope" occurs.
5.When driving at low rpm, foot just barely on the peddle the engine is
surging back and forth like it can't find the right place to be.

What I have done so far:
1.Two trips to the Mechanics
2.Replaced the Idle micro switch, Throttle valve switch and the idle
valve positioner. All these were recommended by both Mechanic shops
3.Run several GALLON'S of Techron through the injector's
4.CO checked twice
5.Air flow meter checked and ajusted Twice!
6.15,000 mile tune-up
7.Intake manifolds tightened (this actually made the car run smoother
and is recommended on this particular model and engine after several
thousand miles)
8.Considering my second suicide attemp!
9.Planning my third trip to the mechanic's

Any advice would be appriciated! Thanks
