VVVince, one data point:  I put a Bursch exhaust in my old '84 Carrera
Turbo-Look; running up & down thru the gears, at autocrosses, and at
track events sounded great.  However, the "growl" got tiring on long
trips.  This was standard Bursch; I believe they also have a "quiet" model
out there, with an added small muffler before the tailpipe.

I remember having poteintial corrosion problems, with rocks/sand/dust 
eventually wearing away paint and starting light surface rust.  Was never able
to find paint that lasted (buddy recommended black barbecue grille paint,
but didn't work).  Don't remember big problem with installation, but center
(main) mounting system was different than factory.

To the list,
I am interested in fitting a "sports muffler" to our 89 Carrera Cab
particularly because my wife has heard the sound in other Carreras and loves
it. This is a pure street car, and track performance is not important. We have
a track car. I am told that B&B and Borla are the best choices. I am looking
for info on other's experience with these mufflers, esp on cabs. Too noisy?
Installation problems? Too noisy for the drive to Steamboat this summer? Are
used units worth considering? I understand that the 2 and four outlet models
require valance mods. How significant mods? All info appreciated. Thanks
