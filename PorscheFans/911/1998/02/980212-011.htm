Hi Luis,

This noise sounds like it might be a broken drive belt in the
distributor. The only indication you of this problem will be a knock at
low RPM's because you can't hear it at high RPM's. The car is running on
six plugs and with 11.3/1 compression you definately need all twelve.

Or it could be something completely different!

Good Luck,

Wayne
