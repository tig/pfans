Mike:
	Dennis Okeefe and Dave Montrois, 1st and 2nd respectively D stock Sebring
1998, are both longterm customers that run the complete FABSPEED exhaust
system from the stock heat exchanger back. 1995 993 with out Cats and
SUPERCUP system. I did not drive or attend the Club Race this year but I
was "informed via cellphone and reports" that my three customers that I
know quite well that their experience, driving skills and race preparation
and my exhaust they had cleaned up and had little competition by C stock
3.3Turbos, Carerra Cup cars and or RS Americas. The GT cars in their run
group were fast but that was about it. Their words and race results that
followed 1997 PCA race results.
	Dennis Okeefe and Dave Montrois have had there cars prep by Dave White
racing in Tampa and Gordon Friedman at Autometrics in Chrleston, SC. Peter
Dawe sets up rafael Llopizs suspension and very soon mine.

I dont know what 2 seconds you are referring to- I was not there.
