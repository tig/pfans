Andrew,
One answer to your question was:

<<If you check with Edmond's or the Kelley Blue Book (or call your local
bank loan officer and ask HER to check), you'll see that  an
excellent-condition, fully-optioned '87 Turbo-Look Cabriolet with 10K
miles is worth around $30,000.>>

In response I'd say that this answer is a good one and a bad one.  An
excellent condition car is probably worth up to $33K.  BUT, you also
have to take into account the mileage.  It's great that Edmund's and
Kelley Blue Book says the car is worth that, but can THEY find one for
that price?  No.  It's a seller's market with a car as rare as your
dad's.  It's easy for someone to sit back and say "That's too much, it's
only worth X", but how many 87 turbo-look cabs with 10K miles are for
sale right now in the US?  One? Two?  In fact, how many are in the US
period!?  I'd say the car would be a steal at $37,000.  Ask $41K and see
what happens.  The mileage IS an add in value.  BTW, I get this all the
time from my customers so it is a subject dear to my heart.
