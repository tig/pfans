Leonard & Rashree:

    You raise some good questions about the brake choices on the market
today.

There are quite a few choices for brake packages for your car. The
limiting factor, regardless of money, is the wheel diameter that you
use. If you have 17" or 18" modular wheels you can use any brakes that
you can afford if the wheel offsets are correct.

One doesn't necessarily need to install the Big Red Caliper kits!
True, they are fabulous brakes are close to the ultimate, aside from the
GT-2 brakes.
There are two other alternatives that will work quite well on your light
75 911.

1) Install the Turbo (930) brake system. This works quite well and you
can easily upgrade the Master Cylinder to the 23mm Mercedes one for
this, as well.

2) Install a 993-type brake system. These brakes worked very well on the
3.6 litre, 2800+ lb 993 and would be even better than the Turbo brakes,
although not as easy to install.

Neither of these alternatives is inexpensive; you may be able to locate
some good used Turbo brakes. They are in demand these days due to their
suitability with 15" wheels.

If you get a chance, look at our Web site on the Brake page to see the
varied options to upgrading your brake system.  Don't feel compelled to
purchase Big Reds unless you really need that sort of capacity. There
are less expensive alternatives available everywhere.

Hope this helps,

Best Regards,
