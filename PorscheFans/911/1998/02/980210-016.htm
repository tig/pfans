1) it does not have A/C. OK, I live in Belgium, this is not California
or Florida, but even a little sun in spring will heat up a car's
interior to an uncomfortable level. As my 911 will be my third car,
and thus good weather only, I'd like to find out through this list how
badly you need A/C in a 911. And what the disadvantages are of having
one
(does it work properly ? does it need lots of maintenance ? how well
does
it age  ? (as I am considering cars that are 10 years old)).

>>My 1986 911 coupe must be an anomaly because it's a/c works great.  I don't
know what the climate is like in Belgium, but I live in northwest
Colorado where the climate is best described as cool and dry (very low
humidity) in the spring and summer, and I use the a/c in my car
anytime the ambient temp is above 60 deg.  This is probably due to the
intensity of the sun at this altitude (6400 ft) and because my car is
black/black.  Of course, you can always drive with the windows open,
but the wind noise quickly becomes annoying (to me) at highway speeds.
 As far as maintenance, I've only had my Porsche about 16 months so I
haven't had to do any maintenance on the a/c, other than making sure I
run the a/c at least once every two weeks for a minimum of 15 minutes
to keep the seals from drying out.

2) it does have a sun roof. Good for ventilation, but I remember reading
about leakages. This sun roof is 10 years old, what about the chance of
it leaking ? How noisy is a 911 sunroof anyway ? (I've driven several
cars
that had quiet sunroofs, others were real nuisances due to excessive
noise levels or sounds)

>>My car also has a sunroof and it does not leak.  By the way, my car only has
22k miles on it, so maybe this explains the working a/c and
non-leaking sunroof.

My advise is to be patient and shop around until you get the exact
Porsche you want - there are too many of them out there to settle for
something that doesn't have certain features that are important to you.
Just my $.02.  Good luck with your Porsche hunt.
