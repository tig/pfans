Hi Mark.  I have a pretty decent system in my 86 Targa.  The PO had some plate
speakers in the back and a couple Boston Acoustics in the doors.  When I got
the car, the cd player was broken so I replaced it with a Blaupunkt Toronto. 
It was a bit pricey though if you don't want to spend a lot.  I mounted a
Kenwood KAC-846 (4 channel) amp under the passenger seat.  I did it without
having to screw it to the floor also (made some brackets and mounted it to the
seat reals; I have a picture if you want to see it).  I wired the front 2
channels on the amp to the factory fade control to power the 4 speakers in the
car.  I used the rear output on the amp (bridged) to drive 2 8 ohm 8" Kicker
subs mounted in a custom enclosure built by Rod Birch of Car Audio
Innovations.  He was very helpful...I highly recommend his box if you are
planning on using subs.  It sounds very good...well balanced and loud enough
even with the top off at highway speeds (80mph).
