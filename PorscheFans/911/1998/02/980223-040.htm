Heh, I am about to break out with that Buffalo Springfield song "For What
its worth" ;) I guess I am just weird...

Anyway, down to business..

My dad thinks his 911 is worth 60,000. I told him that that was a bit
radical (and he was on crack cocaine) but I am not positive.. ;) 

What do you guys/gals think?

It is a :

- '87 Factory Turbo-Look Cabriolet
- White, with white matching wheels, blue leather interior and top
- all options incl central locking, factory alarm, dual power seats, you
name it and I bet it has it
- _only_  10K weekend/summer miles.  
- No rain or snow. 
- It is in pristine condition as my father always waxed it and took all
precautions to avoid dings.. the normal enthusiast pampering ;)
- Reason for selling; not enough use.

It was also the first year for the G50 transaxle, power top, and the
additional hp, but I am sure you already knew that!

wasn't '86 the first year for Turbo Look?

Thanks a lot in advance!

Later
