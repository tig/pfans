Jim,

You can adjust the seats an inch(at least on my C2 you can), if it will
be in your favor or not depends on how the seats are currently mounted.

Forward the seats as much as possible. You should be able to see the
bolts in the rail. If you're lucky, just unscrew the 6 bolts(4 back+2 front)
and move the seat 1" backwards.

(I found this out when I put an amplifier under the drivers seat.)

Subject: Can seatrails be moved back?
To: 911@porschefans.com

I'm 6'8" tall, and just fit in my '92 C2 cab. In fact, I don't fit in the
coupes with sunroofs as they don't have enough head room. The cab has enough
headroom, but I could use just a bit more leg room. I have no problem driving
the car now, but an extra inch or so of legroom would be nice. 

So my question is, can the seat rails be moved back an inch or so to give just
a bit more leg room? Or is there an aftermarket seat rail that would acheive
the same thing? With my seat all the way back, there's still a couple of
inches behind the backrest before it would contact the rear compartment. I
have the 6 way adjustable electric seats.

Any other extra-tall P-fans out there that have addressed this?
