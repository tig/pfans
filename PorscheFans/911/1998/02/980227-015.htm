John Adams please let me know what you find out. I have an 85 Carrera with
a similar problem. It squeaks like the dickens during normal suspension
movement. Not always, it comes and goes.
Someone on this list suggested that it might be a weld problem and that I
could remove the torsion bar and grind down the high spot. When I removed
the t-bar, there was a very clear wear mark on it. I ground it down further
and replaced it. The squeak stopped for about a month and now is back as
bad as ever.

I bought some used A-Arms and t-bars from a wrecked '87 w/ 40K on it to
replace mine, thinking that the rubber bushing must have sagged a bit. When
I finally go the A-arms and T-bars I see that the replacement t-bar is worn
the same as mine, yet the seller said there were never any squeaks.

I think I'm going to try the replacement A-Arms this weekend just for
grins.

Pfans-
I also noticed that Automotion is now selling 'street' hardness replacement
bushings which they claim don't squeal like the 'track' hardness bushing.
Anyone out there have experience with 'em ?
