Hi P-land,

        I was driving last evening, and I notice that my fairly new
purchased 1988 Carrera wanders over uneven road pavement.  The weather was
dry, and the road surface was one of those heavy used main arterial city
streets where there are indications of tire directional sunken pathways.  If
I braked hard on this type of road surface, the 911 would pull side to side
as I fight the steering wheel to control the car's straight direction.  This
fighting for control holds true when accelerating hard...feels like a front
wheel drive negative oversteer.  On smooth road surfaces like a highway, the
911 travels fine...dead straight with no pull.  When I drive my Caravan or
M-Benz 420 over such surfaces, these vehicles tend to do fine with no
directional instability. Could this be a normal travel feeling on a '88
Carrera?  The shocks seem fine, bounces only once when doing the bounce
test, but the suspension seems to squeak when I bounce the 911 up and down
hard.  Is that normal? My M-Benz doesn't seem to make any noise when doing
the bounce test hard.  I recently had a 4 wheel alignment and repacked the
front wheel bearings right after the purchase of the 911. I would like some
advice on possible solutions to my 88 Carrera wandering over uneven pavement.

Thanking you in advance

Rick
