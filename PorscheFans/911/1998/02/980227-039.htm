For Gary Cuozzo:
You can indeed wax the centers of your Fuchs alloys. For an even better
result, rub them liberally with petroleum jelly (as recommended in the
owner's manual) and buff them out with a soft cloth prior to the waxing.

The clutch cable is not a big job. You need to pull back the carpet to
release the clevis pin from the clutch pedal arm and unscrew the clevis.
Then you can pull the old cable out from underneath the car. Before you
install the new cable, set the clearance between the adjustment bolt and
the clutch actuating arm (under the car) at 1.2mm. The SC cable has a
plastic liner, so it doesn't need to be lubricated. Hook the cable to
the arm, and thread it back through from below. Inside the car, screw
the clevis on the cable until the threaded end just begins to protrude
in the yoke of the clevis. Install the clevis pin. Get back under the
car and adjust the nuts on the cable housing until the clearance at the
adjusting bolt is 1mm. I recommend that you use a new clevis and clevis
pin. Hope this helps.

It is of course your car, but IMHO a trailer hitch on a 911 is
sacrilege.
