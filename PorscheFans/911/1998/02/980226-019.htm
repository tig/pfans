I hear the buzzer is located (no pun intented) on the driver side, either
underneath the dash or behind it (accessable from the trunk).  I haven't
located mine yet (86 Targa) but it's a bit anoying.  However mine seems to
operate different than yours.  If the car is running and I turn it off and
open a door, the buzzer sounds.  But if I remove the key, and reinsert it
(without starting the car), the buzzer doesn't sound (with doors open).  So I
can listen to the stereo with doors open without the buzzer sounding.  And
when I'm not listening the radio, my head unit will run without the key in the
acc. position (feature of radio; runs for 1 hour only this way so not to drain
the battery).

The most annoying part of the buzzer I've found is that when the engine is
running and I open a door, it goes off.  I kind of thought these buzzers were
to let a person know they left the key in the ignition.  If the car is
running, I'm pretty sure the key is in the ignition.. :)

Not sure about this one.

I've looked for this also but haven't found one.  If you do, please let me
know.

There is a foldable replacement top call the "Sunbrella" (or maybe it was
Sumbrella.  I think I saw it in a Performance Products catalog.  It's a
foldable top that overlaps the tops of the door windows (suction cups to
them).  They were about $160 or 70 I think.  I asked about them on this list a
few months ago and I think there were a few people that have used them. 
Hopefully one of them can provide more detailed info about them.

hmm, is this the one on Page 3 of their catalog?  I could sure use this if the
rain ever stops around here.  The "911/930 Air Conditioner Flow Enhancement
Kit."  They list it for $59.  The parts in the picture don't look like
much...how much of an improvement does this make?  I get cold air out of my
A/C...but by the time it reachs me it's not that cold (ie, right out of the
vents it feels cold, but the interior never really gets very cold).  What is
involved in installtion?  Zucz says it's about 2 hours with normal hand tools.
 Where do all those parts in the picture go?
