Chris,

I've never had a hard time replacing the O2 sensor and I've always used a
low-cost generic replacement instead of the high-cost Porsche part.  Use
lots of penetrating oil well in advance and then just unscrew it.

Why do you think you car is running rich?  I thought the same thing and
after replacing the O2 sensor, it turns out that it is really running lean.
 The good thing is that the O2 sensor is signalling to richen the mixture
appropriately.

You can test the sensor pretty easily.  Use a digital multimeter to measure
the voltage output from the O2 sensor.  Rev the engine to 2500+ rpm for 30
seconds to warm the sensor.  If the engine is in proper tune and
adjustment, at idle you should see the voltage fluctuate quickly (2 times
per second) crossing the .5volt mark.  

	1v
		  x     x  
	.5v ------------------- (time)
		x     x 
	0v

The goal is to average about .450v, but the reading should fluctuate above
and below this number.  Rich is indicated by >.5volts (too much oxygen) and
lean by <.5 volts (too little oxygen).  I run a wire to into the passenger
compartment so I can connect the meter while driving.  This way I can set
the idle mixture and also read the mixture while driving (actually not the
mixture, but too rich or too lean).

The sensor is bad if you get a consistently low reading (the reading
diminishes as the sensor ages) or if the reading does not fluctuate quickly.

Hope this helps,
