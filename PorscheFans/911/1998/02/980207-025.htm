Dear P-Pholks,

In the latest issue of Imported Automotive Parts & Accessories an article 
caught my eye.  This article explained how rebuilt parts had taken
over a lot of the foreign aftermarket.  This article took about a page to
explain the Porsche Parts Express program.  It told a little about
how the PPE used rebuilt parts to keep the costs down.

Just about evey month this magazine has some piece of information about
our Marque.  This monthly is an "in house" magazine for the aftermarket
industry.  It often lists suppliers to OEM's like Porsche.  Every month a
manufacturer is featured.  Porsche will be featured soon.  When it is,
a large section will be devoted to catalogs offered by suppliers for the
featured marque.  This magazine is free, call and get yourselves on its
mailing list if you are interested.
