Ah yes! It's almost Spring and a PorscheFan's thoughts turn to performance 
modifications!
parker@nitro.bctm.com (Ross Parker) asks:

> Anyone have any idea what a set of RUF wheels would set me back? I'd idly 
musing because I probably can't afford them, but I'd probably want 7" and 
8" x 17.

Last time I looked, about 2 years ago, I think I was offered a new set for 
around $2100. The US Ruf distributor is Lou Foubere who advertises in Pano 
and Excellence as The RUF Performance Haus in Florida. He has many dealers 
around the US. I suspect that very clean used are also available since I've 
seen Wheel Enhancement and Robert Woods both now mention Ruf wheels. You 
should know that the Ruf wheels are heavy; comparable to factory or 
Speedlines. Much lighter wheels in admitedly very different looks are 
available from Fikse among others.

> This is for a 1990 C2 - not YET lowered, but will probably be lowered an 
inch or so.

An inch or so is what I did for my daily driver street/DE car. Any more and 
you need to pre-plan your approach to some driveways and ramps at an angle. 
You can't squeeze too much lowering from the stock suspension so you're 
looking at new springs, minimum and, heck, why not consider new shocks 
along with those springs?

> Will 8" and 9" x 17 fit? Recommended tire sizes? I currently have 205/55 
x 16 front, 245/45 x 16 rear. Car is used primarily for street driving, 
with some autox and driver's ed (hopefully MORE autox and driver's ed in 
the future).

My consideration for the increased width on the front was taming understeer 
on the track. The C4 with the 6" stock front wheels wouldn't seem to go 
directly where I pointed it and I didn't particularly want to slow down. I 
run 8s and 9s on my street wheels and 9.5x17 on the rear for track wheels. 
On the front I use 225/45 in street rubber and 235 in R1s and on the rear I 
run 255/40s. For a C2 ask around if you might be better off staying with 7" 
fronts. (E.g. I think that the S02 tire that fits on the 7" actually has a 
wider tread width than the size-up required for the 8" rim. See their web 
site for complete info on fitments.)

> I'll also be looking at lowering the car - any advice on springs/shocks 
would be welcome!

Let me save you some archive search by quoting Nick Andjar from some old 
Pfans mail, below. It's a fine listing of many of the options. I decided to 
install the complete RUF suspension kit once I realized that I didn't feel 
comfortable  spending the time and effort to sort out spring rates, shock 
rates and sway bars chosen from different supliers. Now, later on, there 
are probably people on this list (speak up!) who have tried each one of the 
different combinations of Eibach with Koni, H&R with Bilstein, Cup car 
springs and bars. I believed the Ruf setup would be well sorted out 
already, and it was. The handling went from bad to mahhhvelous <g>.

These are several ideas to upgrade your suspension.

If your wallet so allows, talk to Lou Foubere (the US RUF importer) and get 
RUFs suspension package (RUF/Bilstein shocks, RUF sway bars and RUF 
springs).  Excellent handling.  Like day and night from the factory 
setting, especially your 1990 C-4 which has a lot of understeer. By the 
way, you do not have to buy everything at once.

Sway bars: (i) buy a set of used RS America sway bars (should not be 
expensive).  They are bigger. or(ii) buy a set of adjustable Cup car sway 
bars from Porsche AG (very expensive) or from AJ-USA (very reasonably 
priced and the quality is as good as Porsche parts).

Shock absorbers: (i) buy a set of used C-2 Turbo shocks, ii) buy a set of 
Bilstein sport shocks, or (iii) buy a set of H&R shocks (they have two set 
ups, racing (expensive) and street (less expensive but still expensive).

Springs: (i) Eibachs are good and not very expensive, (ii) Porsche AG also 
have a sport spring and a racing Cup Car spring, (iii) H&R springs and (iv) 
I understand that the factory sport suspension package of the 964 is 
nothing else but the factory C-2 Turbo suspension ( I have a set of factory 
springs I can sell you).
