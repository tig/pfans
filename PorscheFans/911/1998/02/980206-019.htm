Just a note to all that just this morning I was found "not responsible"
in a speeding violation. The reason was that the ticked was not filled
out correctly.

Here in Massachusetts the ticked must say if the road was posted or not
posted and how the officer determined that I was speeding; radar,
clocked or estimated. In my case none of this was filled in and the
representative of the police said that the ticked was "defective" and
dropped the charge. Hope this helps.
