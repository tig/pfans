Greetings,

For all of you guys with late '80s 911s with Air Conditioning:  where is
the "front condenser" located in these cars?  Behind the front air dam,
between the driving lights?  Certainly not under the car?  How is the freon
routed to this condenser (i.e., what is the normal travel path after
leaving the compressor)?  I am in the process of trying to upgrade my A/C
by putting on the stock rear condenser and the stock compressor and want to
add a front condenser.  I just have never seen first hand the routing of
the freon between all of the components involved, and wonder when does the
front condenser come into play.  Any written info on this (web sites, etc)
would be appreciated (that explicitly show the routing of the freon lines).

Thanks in advance.

Rob
