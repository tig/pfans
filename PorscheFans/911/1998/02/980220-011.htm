Dwight, I had the same problem.  I cut out the old
headliner, and used double -faced masking tape to secure
the new headliner front and back.  There was enough flex
in the top at the front and back to allow me to get the
headliner and tape inbetween the top and the metal
supports.  Make certain that no material overlaps or tape
overlaps occur as they might be visible as a bulge in
the top.  After it was in I used pressure on the outside to
secure it.   I had the car (1985) for two years after and
never had a problem.  It was not noticeable from the
outside.I checked with many sources as to other solutions
but they involved removing the top, gluing the headliner to
the metal front and back and replacing the
top----expensive!!
