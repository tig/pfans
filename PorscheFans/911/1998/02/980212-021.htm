I never saw the original post, but 
Bob Tindel <btindel@gte.net> asked :

>>
Please tell us more about the "unpleasant experience". I'd be interested
in knowing what he paid, and what they did for a "rebuild". They can be
serviced by a DIY-er, but it is a dirty, greasy, messy, (did I say
greasy?) job. <<

Here's my related story (nightmare) from last spring.
I also wanted to avoid the mess and knew that my CVs must
be in bad shape after years and years of autox, pro-solo,
and even drag racing.

I ordered a pair of rebuilt axles for mt '72S  from P.A.P. in Georgia,
they had a very good price, I think $129 with exchange.
The exchange value was low so I kept my old ones as spares
(always carry one to events just in case).

When I got them they came without gaskets, and greased
only internally, not enough grease to install. The grease was green
transparent grease. So I called and asked for the gaskets,
it took a few calls and they finally sent them but charged me.
I also asked about the grease, I would buy some locally if I just
knew what it was. But after several calls I almost gave up.
Customer service was quite lacking.
Finally they sent me some and I tried to install the joints,
as a major event was coming up real soon.

By the way in one of the few orders I placed about that time
they sent me the wrong rubber factory brake hoses for the
car and I returned them. never got credited. Bought them
locally for a lot more $$ as I needed the car together.

Anyway I was installing the new axels and noticed that there
were 6 through holes, rather than 4 through holes with pins in the 
other 2 like my old ones. these holes were in  the thin metal
end-plate of the joint. My old axels had holes all the way
through the heavy metal joints but not on the end plates where 
the head of the bolt rests. I Called and they said it was no problem.
So I moved the roll pins to the new axels and installed them
after greasing them up enough.

After the driving event I noticed there was green grease all over the
bottom of my car which I had PAINSTAKINGLY DETAILED
while the engine was out for tranny rebuild and replacement
of every other part except the engine. ^%$^%$.

I did my best to clean up the mess and noticed that the
grease came out of the 2 through holes with the roll pins.
I guess it flowed through the center of the roll pins.
So I plugged the 2 holes with silicone sealer and
"plastic  metal welding compound". When I pulled the engine
again for the 2nd tranny rebuild that month :-(
I was able to get the rest of the grease off.

Well I'm glad I can let off this steam which is
still boiling a year later. I will not use that parts
outfit again. I have had very good luck with Parts Heaven
in CA who found me a pair of not-too-used early
rear spring plates which I needed for SCCA stock class.
