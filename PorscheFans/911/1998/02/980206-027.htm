Hello all
I've got one of those annoying "my car is making a strange noise"
questions.  Please be kind  :)  The best I can describe it is if you blow
up a balloon, stretch the neck and slowly let the air out making a
high-pitched sqeaking noise, you've got it.

Symptoms:
It's definitely motion-related, as I have shut off the engine and coasted
down a hill and the noise is still audible.
It doesn't start up until around 30mph, and goes away as I come to a stop,
making it damn difficult to track down.
It's coming from the rear of the car and is clearly audible from outside
(rolled the window down while running next to a wall).
It's cyclic, meaning the pitch varies slightly up and down -- from
something rotating is my guess.
It doesn't happen all the time, maybe 60% of the time, so you know as soon
as I take it to the mechanic, it won't do it!

I thought slipping belt or engine pulley at first, but then I got the sound
to continue after I shut down the engine.  I'm stumped.
Any clue?  I'm thinking maybe a wheel bearing, but there's no grinding
sound and the wheel doesn't move when I grab the top of the tire and
push/pull it.

Anyone know the torque for the rear wheel bearings?  That's my next step.
