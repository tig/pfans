I did this same exact thing, replace the bushings while installing a short
shift kit.  I also assumed that the pin should come out.  I tried to press
it out using an appropriately sized socket to hold the housing while
pushing on the pin out.  The housing broke & I ended up replacing the
entire coupler for about $35 or $40 from PAR.

I believe the pin should come out.  If not, then there is no way to replace
the bushings anyway.  Just be careful, or you too will be buying a new
coupler, although it's not the end of the world.

Be sure to mark the position of the coupler on the shift rod so that you
have a reference point to start at when you put it back together.  You will
need to do some adjusting for sure, but that will make it easier to get
started.

I don't know anything about lockout springs.
