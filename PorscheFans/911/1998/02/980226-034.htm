Thomas,

The only problem I have ever heard of with older engines is that some of
the first synthetic oils were not completely compatible with the gasket
material. I have not heard that in a LONG time.

Synthetic oil does have better flow characteristics so it may leak out of
an engine that did not previously show any leaks. Synthetic oil may also
cause larger leaks out of an engine that is already leaking.

Synthetic oil is compatible with any Porsche engine from a mechanical
standpoint.

The bottom line? Today's synthetic oils are better than there convential
counterparts. Keep using Mobil 1 and don't worry!
