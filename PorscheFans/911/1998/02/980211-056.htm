Hi Chris,
I have a Clifford on mine. It was dealer-installed when the car was new,
so it is an old model. No problems or false alarms with it. I don't have
a motion sensor. I had one on another car, and it did false alarm.

The OXS light on the dash is just a little bulb connected to the
odometer counter via a little black box behind the speedometer. Its only
function is to light up when the odometer hits 30,000 miles, telling you
it's probably time to replace the oxygen sensor. 

Replacing the sensor is not difficult, except it may be rusted in place.
Give it a good soak with penetrant and let it sit for a while before you
attack it. I tried one of the special split sockets (Lisle brand), and
it just expanded as it was torqued, then slipped. I wound up using an
open-end wrench. Before you unscrew the sensor itself, unplug it from
the connector inside the engine cover on the driver's side, and thread
the wire down through the tin.
