You mentioned that teh wheels are Fuchs so they should be anodized and then
the centers painted.  I've never heard of clear coating on the originals,
which could only be done to the painted part, but perhaps it was and there is
nothing to keep you from doing it except for the fact that, and again I might
be wrong, the black centers were generally not glossy but semi-glossy.
(Perhaps it was just brake dust!!!)

Call Robert Wood at Wheel Enhancement in Calif. and get another quote and ask
him what should be done.  He is the expert and honest.  Some wheels I had him
do years ago looked perfectly original.  310-836-8908  I have no connection
with him other than being a past loyal customer.
