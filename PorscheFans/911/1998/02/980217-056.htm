Don,
   Sorry I can't help you with Calif info, but I did buy a gray market 930
a year & 1/2 ago into Wisconsin, which is also a nasty state to deal with
(car was from NC).  In my case it was Absolutely mandatory to have BOTH the
EPA and DOT paperwork which was generated when the car was imported.
Actually found a guy at the EPA who was extremely helpful (defective gene
for a government employee) in tracking mine down.  Hopefully your PO
already has all the papers.  If my experience is of value, will be happy to
share it.
   Bottom line for anybody with an imported car -- Maybe your state doesn't
care about, or track the paperwork (at least for now).  However, the resale
value to those of us in picky states like CA and Wisconsin demands these
records or the car can not be titled - making the car worthless.  Something
to think about...
...... Fred  '84  930  Black

PS - Am behind on my Digests.  Noticed a later comment regarding reduced
value of gray mkt cars due to paperwork hassle.  Well .... my Euro spec 930
produces more horsepower (300 vs the US 286 - I think), has a lowered ride
height, and a number of "cosmetic" improvements that were originally
designed by Porsche and removed on US spec cars.  Things that cost extra to
have added.  HUM - perhaps they are worth more?
