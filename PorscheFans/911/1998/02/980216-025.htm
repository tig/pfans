Hello,
 I'm going to look at a 1970 911S tomorrow evening that the owner says has a 
slight stumble at the lower rpm's but works fine as the engine revs up.  I know 
this is not much info to work with, but if someone with expertise in the early 
911 fuel injection system could comment on possible causes and how much I could 
be looking at to repair the problem if it is f.i. specific ($1k, $2k, $3k??).  I 
would greatly appreciate it.  You can respond directly to 
jsavage@crystal.cirrus.com if you would like.  Also any comments on known 
problems to look for with this model year (rust locations? I think the bodies 
were not galvanized back then), that would also be great.
			thanks in advance,
			Jason Savage
