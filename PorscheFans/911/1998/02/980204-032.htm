I have a near new 911 Speedster with 11K's on the clock, that leaks like a sieve when the hood is up in moderate rain, mostly around the seal between the side windows and hood. The manual kindly points out that I should not expect it to be "waterproof" and small amounts of leaking should be expected, due to my insurance companies reluctance to shell out $ 1000 everytime it rains to clean up the interior/computer etc. has anyone got any advice/experience with making these cars a little less leaky.

Apart from the optional wading pool the car is fantastic.

Thanks 
Rob - who's getting tired or squelching around.
