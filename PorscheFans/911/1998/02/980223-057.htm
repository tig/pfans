There is a compound made for windows that removes spots.  I bought it from an
RV place (Ron's RV).  It's in a round canister type container (I forget the
name of it).  It's a white pouder that you rub on the window (with a damp
rag).  It forms a film that you then buff off.  It's works very well.  I have
a box van that sat for about a year and it had horrible water spotting on the
windows.  This product made the windows look brand new.  I don't have it off
hand (it's in the box van, which is not parked at my home) or I would tell you
the name of it.  If you have any Camping World stores nearby they would
probably carry something similar.
