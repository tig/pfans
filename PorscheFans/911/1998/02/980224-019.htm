Hello all,

After 97K miles, my original clutch is giving out on my recently
acquired 88 Targa.  (Tells you a lot about how the car was driven before
me...)  but the latest DE event at TWS was hard on it and it is time to
visit the good old mechanic to replace the clutch.

1) Any advice, while we are in there deep, about what else should be
done or upgrades of any sort, (such as main rear seal, throw out
bearing, or anything else)?

2) As far as the actual clutch replacement, any advice as to type of
clutch to put back in (stock Carerra, Turbo set-up,  or some after
market system) as I will drive the car in about 3 or 4 DE events per
year and maybe one or two autocrosses per year, in addition to about
6,000 to 8,000 miles of street driving per year. So I need something
that will be heavy duty enough for the track use but still driveable on
the street.

3) Finally, what is a reasonable price to pay for a typical replacement
such as this.

Thanks in advance

Dan Germain
88 Targa
