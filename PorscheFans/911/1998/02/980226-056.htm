I have a 1990 C4 Cab and the tail only works intermittently.
I have watched it very carefully and have reason to believe
it is simply a loose connection somewhere.  When it works,
it works perfectly, when it doesn't, it doesn't at all.  

Running over bumps sometimes jars the loose connection into
working.  It has gotten worse for the last 6 months.  Back
then it worked 90% of the time, now it works about 10%.

I don't mind it not raising as much as having to park it
at work with the tail up :)

Anyone know where the likely connection problem would be ?
I have done some light poking around but haven't found
anything yet.

Thanks,
