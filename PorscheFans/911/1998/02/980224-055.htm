My 86 has the same problem.  The brakes work great otherwise.  The sound is
not a metal-to-metal grinding or scratching but more of a vibration.  I'd
describe it as something similar to a tuning fork.  At first I thought it was
the clutch, but it will do it out of gear coasting and just slight pressure on
the brake pedal instantly stops the sound.  It happens when I lift off the
brakes, usually after lightly pressing them (like sitting at a stop sign, or
coasting to a stop).  Under hard braking it doesn't do it (or at least I
didn't notice).  In my car it definitely sounds like it's coming from the
master cylinder area.

I'm not sure what causes it, but it hasn't affected braking here, so I haven't
been real concerned with it.

Let me know if you figure out what is causing it.
