I used to use hi-temp BBQ paint on other cars, but when I bought my Cab,
it had C2 wheels and the corroded calipers, hubs and wheel spacers were
very noticeable. I cleaned the surfaces with lacquer thinner and roughed
up the spacers for better adhesion. I used oil-base polyurethane paint,
two coats brushed on, in gloss black. The poly paint comes in many
colors, I bought a small can at Lowes for a few bucks. I did it last
spring, and after about 6k miles last year the paint still looks like
new, and it's very easy to clean.
