Well, I am into spark plug removal.  Removed lower plugs using 5/8" spark
plug socket and 10" lockable extension, all 3/8" drive.  Muffler had to come
out on passenger side, not on driver's side.  Am now struggling with
uppers - a 3" extension is too short, a 6" is too long.  On driver's side
finally got plugs changed using 3" ext. with either a 1" ext. or a ball-&-
socket universal joint.  Passenger side is real struggle - can't get the above
combo in place to remove plugs (started on one closest to bumper).

Decided to read the shop manual (helluva time to do it!).  They mention
to use Snap-On socket S 9706 with extension FXW 4.  Are these 
anything special besides what I can get at Sears?  Anybody know how
a private party can get Snap-On tools?

They also say to remove upper plugs pull both mufflers then the engine 
covers between the camshaft housing and the body sides, apparently
you then remove plugs from underneath.  Also mention to install plugs
w/o any lubricant, but I used copper-based Never-Seize (Istill feel this
is better policy, was also recommended by local shop with lots of
911 experience).
