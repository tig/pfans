That's a good summary.  I faced the same decision and came out the other
way.  The C2 feels like a newer, more refined (and yes, faster) car.  The
'87-'89 has a more raw, raucous "vintage" feel to it that I find very
appealing... and it's still quick as a scalded cat.

I'll also admit to being pretty spooked by the documented problems with
*some* early C2's, their additional expense and complexity of maintenance,
and the suggestion that they won't hold their value as well.  (Even if this
turns out not to be true, I think it's fair to say that the C2 is still
depreciating, while the Carrera has just about bottomed out.) I summed this
up to myself as feeling better about buying the last of a well-established
model than the first of a new one.

It's ultimately a very subjective decision, though.  To me, the '87-'89 is
the last of the "classic" 911's.  And I just plain like the looks of the
Carrera better than the C2.

Different strokes... drive 'em both and make your own mind up.  You can
take comfort in knowing that either way you'll be getting one of the
world's great cars.  Just make sure that either way you have an experienced
mechanic take a good close look before you put your money down.

Good luck,
