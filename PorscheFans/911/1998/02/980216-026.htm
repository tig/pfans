>Second View is on the whole...getting your woman to love the Porsche as much
as you do issue.

I'm having the same problem here, but with my man... having been a loyal
944 owner for the past few years, I've now found the 911 of my dreams.
It's a 94 Speedster, guards/black, close to immaculate. I've been driving
past it every day for the last couple of weeks and am supposed to test
drive it today (haven't yet because of El Nino--blame it on El Nino-- it's
been wet every day and being so beautifully detailed I just couldn't trash
it). 

The problem is that my husband doesn't quite love Porsche as much as I do.
He says he won't stand in my way if I want it, but here's the deal he's
offered me:  he's willing to go in halves with me on a new Audi A6 sedan,
and give me half of his 94 black/black NSX, and we take turns driving them.
 Or, I get the Porsche, it's 100% mine, but I pay for the whole thing.
Either way, I want to keep my 944 as a track car.  The Speedster would
never touch the track. 

Now, they're both good deals.  He really loves Audi's, so I _think_ he'd be
pretty fair about sharing the cars equally.  But what if I got stuck
driving the sedan all the time??? And NSX's are great, wonderful cars, but
they're not Porsches.  They're refined, subtle, responsive, but not WOW!
wind-in-your-hair knock-em-dead gorgeous cars like the Speedster.

I haven't been able to sleep the last few days, worrying over this, and I
really do need to get some sleep soon.  

Thanks, P-Fans,
