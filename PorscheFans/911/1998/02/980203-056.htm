My car is an early 911 w/ boge struts that has been lowered and has a
weltmeister strut brace.   My problem is that it seems whenever I go over a
bump the front suspension doesn't have enough travel (the car has the
appropriate rack spacers for bump steer)  I am concerned that when the koni
externally adjustable strut inserts were put in that the mechanic left the
washer or spacer  on the top of the strut housing.   My question is can you
drop the top of the strut out to inspect and if so what is the best procedure
for this?     I attempted to do this earlier today but after removing the top
nut securing the strut I couldn't get the strut to release.  Do I need to
disassemble the strut brace?  or is this just something that I will have to
fight with to get it to drop out for inspection?

Thanks for your help
