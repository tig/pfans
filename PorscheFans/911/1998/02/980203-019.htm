Morning,

To be brief : I found one leak, at the rear window seal, it's taped over
for now... The seal is only $40 but the glass shop says the job is a
bitch and will probably cost $200 labor. I don't want to do it myself.
Is that a complete rip off ? 

- I got my replacement seatbelt from vertex, and have not installed it
yet. I was pulling on it just to see if it worked and it stays locked, I
can only get 2 inches of travel until it locks up. Is there a safety to
undo somewhere ? Does it magically unlock when installed ?  Please help
on that one ! 

- Also got my H4s ($250 with paintable trim rings), nice. I haven't
removed the current lights, so I don't know what the seal looks like. Do
I need H4 seals, or can I reuse the old ones ? 

Many thanks for your help ! 

Greg. 83 SC (submarine coupe, right now)
