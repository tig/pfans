I am looking to buy a 92 C2-Coupe.  The Car is a manual transmission, has
air, ps, pb, p-seats, sun-roof, CD, and is guards red with a tan interior.
Currently has 52k on the odometer the asking price is $32,000.  I have never
owned a Porsche before but have saved for years to afford this car.  I hope
this is the forum for these questions.  Some questions I have are as follows:


1. I have looked at Blue Book for the car and in a lot of classified ad's
and $32,000 seems to be to low.  I brought a friend who does some of his own
restorations and he says the car has never been painted or wrecked.  Also I
called the Toy Store (dealer in Fl.) and the sales guy I spoke with told me
that only about a thousand 92 C-2 Coupes came to the states and that this
car is relatively rare.  My question is why the low price?  The wholesaler I
am buying the car from has been in business for several years and I am sure
they are no fools.  Is this car rare?  Will it hold its value better than
others?

2. I am not purchasing it from a dealer.  The company selling it is
basically a wholesaler of exotic cars in Mi.  They are sending it to an
authorized dealer to have an inspection (that I am paying for) done today.
What things will this inspection tell me?  What warning flags should I look for?

3. The car also has an after market exhaust and the "chip".  This scares me
into thinking that the previous owner rode the car pretty hard.  I do not
really care about the extra 10hp that this chip gives me.  Would it be
better for the engine for me to put the original Porsche chip back in?

4. I read in Excellence magazine that you should take the engine under-tray
out.  Why would you do this?

5. What is your rough guess on yearly maintenance, I plan about 10,000 miles
a year?  

6. Do you think the 964 cars will depreciate in value faster due to the body
style of the 996's being so different?  Or might they actually go up in
value (wishful thinking)?

7. Lastly when taking it for a test drive after starting the engine cold it
would idle then jump up about 400 rpm for a second, then back to idle then
back up 400 rpm, this would happen for about 10 seconds then it would hold
still on idle.  Also this would not happen when the car was warm.  Is this
normal for a Porsche?  Could the after market chip be responsible?


Fans, I hope you can afford a couple of minutes to answer my questions.  If
I feel comfortable with the inspection and possibly the answers that you
give me I hope to take possession this Friday (been dreaming of this since I
was seventeen).  Thank again for your time.  Being new to the group I hope
this is the proper place for these questions.
