There is a very interesting article in February's Panorama (Horsepower Ra=
tings
and Sensitivities, by Allan Caldwell) that deals with different horsepowe=
r
measurement standards and methods, etc., and that uses that *same*example=
 to
make a point. There were no changes at all in the engines themselves. The=
 only
change was that the DME maps were revised for premium fuel, which became
required, whereas the older engines didn't have that requirement. It seem=
s that
Bruce Anderson dyno-tested a few engines with different DME boxes and fou=
nd no
measurable differences. The author seems to think that the reason for the=
 HP
increase is that the factory was overly conservative in their estimates o=
n the
earlier engines!
