Larry,
I have a 90 C2 - all you need to do is install an alarm with
remote that will operate door locks.   The door
locks set the factory alarm, and by installing the alarm, I
have remote operation and two alarm systems --
the relay for the door locks is in the passenger side
footwell -- can't remember wire colors off hand, but if
you need more information, e.mail.   I think you can buy
door-lock only kits, or if you find an inexpensive
alarm you don't really need to hook the siren and sensors if
you are not trying to improve security.
