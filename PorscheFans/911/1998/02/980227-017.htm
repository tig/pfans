I have a stock 90 C4 Coupe, which I have owned 5 months.

After several hours of highway driving, the Central Warning Light
(exclamation point), Central Warning Buzzer (very loud), and Interlock
Warning Lamp on the dash go off repeatedly. On one occasion, the ABS
Warning Lamp lit along with the Interlock Warning Lamp.  I clear the alar=
m
by turning off the engine momentarily.

No fault codes are stored in the diagnostic system memory and the problem=

won't repeat itself in town.

Incidentally, I read that the grounding strap on the engine lid can chaff=
e
one of the ignition cables and cause the ABS warning light to illuminate.=
 =

My cables were chaffed, so the grounding strap was re-routed per the TSB
and the ignition cables were replaced, but that wasn't my problem--though=

it could be yours!  My car idles nicely now that the grounding strap isn'=
t
arcing on the ignition cable!

I heard that the Interlock Warning Lamp may illuminate if the brake fluid=

is low or too old.  I had mine flushed and replaced.  This seemed to solv=
e
the problem for a while, but it's back.

Does anyone have any ideas where I can look next?

I am also wondering if I have any electrical gremlins, my four way hazard=

flashers operate with the fuse removed from the bonnet fuse block.  Car h=
ad
LoJack installed by PO and I am wondering if there is feedback.  Does
anyone else have hazards which work with the fuse removed?
