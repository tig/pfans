[snipped balance of good advice to Gregory}

Walt- 
I humbly submit one minor correction to your statement above, which in no way
impacts the appropriateness of your response to Gregory.  It was not from "day
one" that 911 and 912 shift knobs were a press fit from the factory, but from
March 21, 1967 onward. My '66 has a threaded top on the shift lever, as did
all 911 and 912's prior to that date. The knob has internal threads that screw
onto the rod for these early cars, not the press fit with clamping sleeve that
later cars have.

I only obtained first-hand knowledge of this piece of trivia while attempting
installation of a Weltmeister short shift kit, which unfortunately ignores
this variation and requires replacement of the shift knob on early cars, an
added expense I had not anticipated. It is documented in the factory service
manual for '65-'68 911s on pg.SR 29, which also has a picture and drawings of
the homemade tool for removing the press fit knobs. On the next page, it has
the picture you spoke of regarding driving the new knobs on, using special
tool P 299!  I'll be looking for a piece of plastic pipe, as you suggested, or
a hollowed out block of wood to use for this, myself. 

Many thanks to you and all the other contributors to this list, who offer such
a rich resource of collected knowledge and experience to DIY'ers like myself.
