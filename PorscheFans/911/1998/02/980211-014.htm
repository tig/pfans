1) The supertrapp muffler (I used the word loosely) is a cone shaped 
megaphone with no muffling elements inside.  Noise reduction is 
obtained by capping the end of the megaphone.  It comes with a series 
of disks. The disks are slotted such that exhaust can escape out the 
slots in each disk. By adding disks you push the solid end cap 
farther from the megaphone and increase the number of holes through 
which the exhaust and noise can escape. More disks = more noise. 

I'd be careful about using them though.  I've seen problems on 911 
engines caused by running them wide open (i.e. no disks and no end 
cap). Valves were burnt, no doubt because the 911 engine requires 
some form of back pressure for efficient scavenging (Bruce Anderson 
should be answering this).

I've used them on 4 stroke dirt bikes to reduce noise levels as well 
as on race cars which back in the old days could be driven to the 
track. Once there remove the disks and end cap for a wide open 
exhaust system. 

If the exhaust system is properly set up they work quite well but 
they're heavy. Running a race engine with disks in can result in 
disks blowing out (ask me how I know). If all you want is a nice 
noise I'd suggest B and B or Supercups.

2) Turn Signals on Porsches are designed to serve as parking lights 
which are required in a number of european countries. In france cars 
parked on the street have to show a light on the street side. 
Headlights are NOT ALLOWED in the city so you can see why this idea 
has merit.

On any Porsche I've ever had including my 95 and 96, leaving the turn 
signal on after you remove the ignition key will leave the lights on, 
unblinking. Left or right depending on which way you throw the lever.
My BMW 540 also does this. Relax, it's normal and if you take your 
car to Europe or, if Joan Claybrook comes up with another stupid 
safety idea like this, you'll be ready.
