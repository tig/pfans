On both 944s I've owned, the involved mechanics (different, but both
factory-trained) have advised turning the half-shafts end-for-end to
equalize not only the CV joint wear, but the wear on the spline assembly as
well. 

I may have transferred this advice to 911s and assumed the design to be
similar. The 944 has a three-component spline design with a series of hard
plastic rollers assembled with two metal shafts to form the half shaft
assembly.

If just swapping the CV's is correct on 911s, then color me blush. In the
words of the immortal Agent Max, "Sorry about that, Chief."
