Does it smell?  I get that too, but I've always though it was condensation
(relatively damp around here lately; lots of rain).  When I see this white
smoke, it seems to vary in the amount of time it is coming out, etc.  Which is
why I've always thought it was just condensation in the exhaust.  It's totally
odorless too.

And about 1 time out of 50 starts I get a small cloud of blue, but this is
normal or so I hear for this type of engine (also oil consumption is very
little; maybe 1/3 quart in 4K miles).

Since I got my Targa last July, it's done something similar.  The steering
wheel is turned slightly towards the right when driving straight.  Also the
car drifts to the right when you take your hands off the wheel.  I haven't had
it aligned or checked out yet (was going to do that when I replace the tires
in a month or two).  Mine doesn't drift or pull to the right much or I would
have done something about it by now.

If you find something that can explain the wheel being skewed or the drifting
to the right please let me know.  I've always thought it must be the alignment
but since you've had it aligned, maybe not.  Have you tried any other places
to set the alignment?  I don't know much about the suspension, etc but I
wonder if camber settings or something that would not be checked during an
alignment (or is the camber adjustment part of what they check when you have
an alignment done?) could be off too.
