Doug, I have an '87 myself and am looking into shock replacement.  One of
mine is actually going bad (has a "free play" region) after "only" 79k
miles, which was somewhat surprising given the quality Bilstein is so well
known for.  I had also been led to believe mine has Bilsteins.

My car came with the same Sport Shocks option as yours.  My mechanic was
sure the shocks were Bilstein.  However, all the guidance I have received
from the list here and calling places (including Bilstein, and RD
Enterprises) say that you should be able to tell if they're OEM Bilstein by
the obvious green color.  I washed and scrubbed my struts and they are
black.  I then did two more things which nailed this case closed, I think:

        1. Called up PCNA, gave them my VIN, and had them check the
        factory records.  Lo and behold, the car was outfitted with Boge
        Sports!

        2. Drove back to my mechanic and had him take a closer look.
        He determined they were in fact Boges.

So mine are certainly Boges.  Yours probably are too.  The factory told me
that the 1987 Turbos came with Bilsteins.  The Sport Shock option on
non-Turbos is Boge Sport.

BTW, I'd recommend any non-original owner to call PCNA in Reno, NV, and
register themselves as the owner of the car.  You can request a printout of
all your factory options, and I've noticed I'm getting more Porsche related
junk mail (always fun).

I've gotten very high recommendations for RD Enterprises to purchase.  BTW,
Bilstein recommends for stock suspensions going with the HD, not Sport.  But
others on the list here do think otherwise.

                -Mike

'87 Carrera coupe, Venetian Blue (but the factory says it's Midnight Blue!! 
Can't be right, the paint code in the car matches Venetian Blue.)
