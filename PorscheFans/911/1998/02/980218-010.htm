Just bought a 1974 911 2.7. The car has been extensively restored both =
mechanically and bodily, and I have been able to follow much of the work =
as it progressed.
My big concern is that the suspension seems to be very hard, perticularly =
compared with other 911's of this age that I have driven. I am pretty =
certain that the car is fitted with  Bilsteins all around, along with 6 =
and 7 x 16 Fuchs and Dunlop D40 205/55s and 225/50's. I think that the =
anti-roll bars are standard size, the car had genuine SC flares welded in =
last winter before a full respray.
The ride is extremely firm, almost harsh. Two other 911 owners locally =
have driven the car and agree. I am in Northern Minnesoata so the car does =
not get driven in the winter, but the roads up here are pretty bad, and I =
am concerned about beating up what is an otherwise very nice car,
Does anybody have ANY ideas about what to do or what to check? Do I have =
to go back to 15" wheels/tires, change struts/shocks, if so anybody want =
to do a swop for some mint 16" Fuchs? Sure would appreciate any ideas you =
might have.
Thanks
Pete Spoor.
