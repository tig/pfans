A reply to Bill and any other owners of early (pre 75) brake/strut 
setups.

Several ways to go:

-pick up a set of oem used spindles, no brake upgrade

-used spindles and possible early bmw 320i calipers, we've done it on 
914s and i think the spacing is the same, they just need to be machined 
a little.

- S calipers, some people swear by them, others swear at them.
i suppose its a matter of the quality of the caliper and rebuild kit
used.

-later struts and brakes, 75 and later use the same type of caliper, you 
will need to update your master cylinder though, i would go for the 21 
or 23mm m/c, its a Mercedes part. made by ATE the oem manuf for Porsche

Of course the later the suspension in the 75-89 range the more likely it
will be in good shape, however anything past '68 is going to need, a 
complete front suspension as it is different. from the 65-68 cars.

Most of these parts are fairly pletiful in the used market, beware of 
suspension parts off wrecks though, they tend to be bent..

Any questions, feel free to call or email me,
