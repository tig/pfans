>I tried SuperTrapps on my 1971 911S, so I can answer some of your questions:
>
>1. Does anyone have a description of what these exhausts are?
>They appear to be simple devices; think of it as an inside pipe surrounded by
>an outside pipe.  The inside pipe is perforated with an inside diameter that
>should align with your exhaust pipes.  The SuperTrapp's inside pipe is
>surrounded by what looks like fiberglass packing material.  The outside is a
>larger diameter pipe (somewhat conical shaped).  The exhaust end is capped
>with a solid piece to keep the packing material inside (and, of course, an
>exhaust hole that aligns with the inside perforated pipe.
>
>2. What is the effect of the discs?
>With no discs on the exhaust end, there is an unencumbered passage for
>exhaust gasses straight out the back.  You can add up to two dozen or so
>disks to the exhaust end.  These disks are donut shaped (to allow exhaust to
>flow through the center) and are the same diameter as the outside diameter of
>the SuperTrapps; they are designed to allow spacing gaps (perhaps 1/32 inch)
>between plates.  The final disc is solid, with no hole for exhaust to pass
>through. Adding plates would then add back pressure, probably force exhaust
>gasses through the perforated inner pipe, and force the exhaust to exit
>through the spaces between the discs.  The fewer disks you add, the more back
>pressure you get; the more disks you add, the less backpressure (well, the
>least back pressure would be with no disks).  The discs are easy to change,
>and the net of all this is that you can somewhat tune your car's torque curve
>by changing the number of discs.
>
>3. Would they be street-legal (in terms of noise; I currently have a Bursch
>which has a nice sound to it)?
>Probably yes, with 6-12 discs installed; probably not without any discs.
>
>4. Supplier/pricing?
>I got mine from Jegs.  They can be reached at (800)345-4545 or
>http://www.jegs.com/.  As I recall they cost about $110 each (you'll need
>two) and I had a brace built for it that cost me about $150.  So, it was a
>$370 experiment for me.
>
>I didn't like them on my car.  The noise was very loud (it actually sounded
>much louder inside the car than outside), performance seemed worse when discs
>were installed, and I was not convinced of any performance increase on the
>track without any discs.  From 6,000-7,200 rpm the car seemed noticeably
>stronger, but it seemed weaker at all other rpm's.  The worst of it was a
>flat spot between 3,500-5,000 rpm.  Of course these characteristic changed as
>I used different number of discs, but the general storyline is the same.
>
>Since I tried the SuperTrapps, I've read a number of articles stating that
>the factory sport exhaust was the best choice for getting power from my car.
>A few months after installing the SuperTrapps, I changed to a sport exhaust
>and I very please with the change.
>
>I have a friend with a '79 SC that is going to try to use my SuperTrapps, but
>he is having a custom exhaust built that will include a crossover pipe.  I
>suspect that the lack of a crossover pipe was the major problem with my
>experiment; although I may have changed due to the interior noise anyway.
>
>Let me know if you choose to try them.  I have an excellent brace for
>SuperTrapps that I would be willing to sell if my friend does not use it.
