I had a Euro 1982 Mercedes 500sl a few years ago, I purchased the car
from my parents.  

Pluses & Problems as follows:

Pluses:  

Gobs of power in European Trim
Unique in the fact that there is not that many of these cars in US


Minuses:

Apparently, Mercedes produced 5 or 6 different engines for the Euro 500
car, so finding the right parts and ordering parts was a pain. Probably
won't apply for 911's

Finding someone who can work on the car correctly, probably won't apply
for 911's

Lower resale than US Spec cars

Possible problems with Emissions etc. conversions

Insurance: 

Call a bunch of insurance places, ask if they insure grey market cars.

I worked as an underwriter for about 5 years, and generally insurance
companies don't like to insure grey market cars as parts are hard to
find, their expensive etc.

Some insurance companies don't care, some insurance companies will give
you a surcharge (around 10%) for having a grey market car and some
companies won't look hard enough at the vin number to find out it's a
grey market car, and after 60 days of a policy being written - the
insurer is stuck with you as a policy holder until renewal, they can
only cancel you for nonpayment of premium.

I had no problems insuring my car, but I had to pay a surcharge.


If you have been looking and looking for that just right, unmolested car
- you might want to think again about grey market cars, there are big
horror stories about companies that convert Grey Market cars.  Also,
there is talk that Grey Market cars are abused more, or worked harder
than US Spec cars due to speed limits in foreign countries.

If I was to do it again, I probably would look for a US spec car.
