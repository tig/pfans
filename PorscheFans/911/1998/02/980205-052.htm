I just checked with a guy that had a '77 911S. It came from the factory
with the bolt-on sway bar mount. I asked another person that has built
quite a few track cars over the years. Most of the '77 cars he saw also
had the bolt-on sway bar mount. All the 911SC's he has ever seen have the
bolt-on sway bar mount.

It would appear that Porsche introduced them sometime during the '77 mode=
l
year production run.

alloy arms) had the ball mount for the rear sway bar; the bolt-on mount

arms are identical. This was information according to AASE Bros. where I
prepped and photographed the arms shown in the article. If an SC (=9178) =
had the
ball mount, this might have been due to an early production model.
