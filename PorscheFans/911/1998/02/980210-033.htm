Andy:

DON'T SPLIT the caliper.  That is for pros only.  Try and remove the pistons
and clean out from that side.  A good way to remove stuck pistons is with a
grease gun.  Loosen the brake bleed 'valve' and pump it up with a grease gun.
That will get any stuck pistons out (you may have to hold one or more in place
or use some old pads and spacers, etc.  Once out, clean the caliper in a
solvent bath or try brake clean or carb cleaner.  If the bores are bad, you
can send them out to be redone/relined.  The pistons and seals should probably
be replaced if they are old and pitted or seals cracked.

The grease gun trick is also good if you are ever trying to free a stuck
piston in an old engine (non-Porsche, of course) and the valves are or can be
closed and the piston is not at the bottom of it's stroke).  Make an adapter
to fit in the spark plug hole and fill the cylinder with grease under
pressure.  Consider buying a pneumatic grease gun and a 5 gallon bucket of
grease first.
