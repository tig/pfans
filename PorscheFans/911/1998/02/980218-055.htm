Mark,

Boy, this is going to be tough NOT being brutal . . . 

If you were my customer, I would ask you how much money you had and
how attached you were to your boat anchor :) (said in an effort to lighten
an otherwise depressing conversation).    

The engine sounds like utter toast, with a rod thrown through the case.  
There will be very little salvageable on it.   The case is gone, the crankshaft
with it, and at least one piston and cylinder.    


I might be a lot more worried about the body, however.
Rust in an early car can be real bad, so much so that most PCA regions
now require serious inspections of these cars before letting them on the
track for speed events, so bad has been the recent experience with 
structural rust.    Structural rust can literally cause these cars to fall
apart,
and if you are already seeing it in the engine compartment structure, you
are likely to find a lot more.    Therefore, the logic involved in installing
another engine in this structure must take into account a sober evaluation
of its condition lest ye create a time bomb.

A couple of years ago one of our local owners put a huge amount of money
into an engine rebuild, a new interior, flared fenders, and a new paint job
(on a 1970 body), only to have the rear torsion bar structure exit the car
(with the engine attached) while he was on a quiet cruise down the freeway.

This car will be worth much more as parts, and would be frightfully expensive
to restore, a money pit of the worst kind. 

Maybe it isn't that bad, but you would be well-advised to be awfully critical
before proceeding.   Your dollar estimates might be dreamland . . . 

Constructively,

Dave
