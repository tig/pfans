Perhaps I was addressing the wrong question.  I was making a minor, albeit
picky, point.  

In the US, Porsche marketing called the car a 930 thru 1979 (they even sold
some really late 1979's which were actually 1980 production, i.e. made after
their annual model changeover, in the US calling them 1979 cars).  The car was
then not sold here from MY 1980 thru 1985.  When the car was reintroduced to
the US in late 1985 as a 1986, it was referred to as a 911 Turbo.
