	I am sorry to read about you problem in "porschefans" with your B&B
Triflow muffler just dropping off a significant and very meaningful piece.
Get it repaired or replaced the muffler at once. You will definitely melt
your rear bumper cover and could potentially have a fire. Tim Rosengrant
NNJR PCA has had the same problem- lost the right side outlet elbow with
tip at POCONO during an event. Right side valance and a portion of rear
bumper were melted beyond repair- had to be replaced and repainted.
	If you have no damage it is simple to replace the elbow and tip if B&B
will sell you the parts that felloff their system. Any competent muffler
and brake shop can expand the slip joint and use a muffler clamp after you
mic and measure and align the tip(s) for symetry and distance in the
exhaust bezel/outlet. Any muffler shop or weldor can tack weld using TIG
and/or MIG the slip joint so this never happens again. This can be done for
a moderate charge.
	If you cannot get satisfaction and materials to fix your B&B system give
me a call I have plenty of T304SS mandrel bends (1st measure your outlet
pipe OD and ID that lost the elbow/outlet) and tips.  I would be more than
happy to send you. I have 3, 4, 4.5" rolled edge and ovalized rolled edge
tips that are angle cut and machined.
	If your bumper has been damaged call Tim at tims964@aol.com or
717-839-5920. He is the person mentioned above that had the same experience
with a B&B muffler as you and had to replace the bumper. Tim owns a
bodyshop and would repaint at minimum charge your R-side valance and or a
salvaged piece- just give him a color code.
	Lastly, if your car has a full B&B header system, that is nice quality, I
manufacture header muffler Dualin/ Dualout. I use a proprietary muffler
that attaches  and works beautifully (flows much better and is lifetime
guarantee) with B&B header equiped C2, C4,RSA, and Carrera Cup cars.
Muffler and dual outlet tips 100% T304 all welded no slip fit joints!
	Let me know if I can offer assistance.
