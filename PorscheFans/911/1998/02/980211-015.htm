Congratulations on being able to fulfill your Porsche dreams! The price
sounds about right for a car with that mileage (kilometerage?) on it, and
without A/C. Since I recently bought an '87 Carrera Targa, I might offer a
few thoughts.

1. No A/C: This is no big deal. The installed A/C in my car is mostly
psychological in its impact. With windows and sunroof open, you shouldn't
have much of a problem, unless you believe that life needs to be lived in a
freezer. (Trust me, I was born in a snowbank and brought up in a blizzard)  ;)

2. 9" rear wheels/lowering/handling. Before you buy, have a trusted
independent shop (not the one you're buying from, even if Mother Teresa is
the service manager) do a thorough pre-purchase exam. This will be worth
whatever it costs. As well as watching the compression and leakdown test,
join the mechanic while he closely examines the front and rear suspension
members for evidence of bottoming or bumping against the rubber stops or
other parts. Be sure the prior owner (PO) "rolled" the inner fender lips
upward along the top 45 degrees of the fender arc to prevent tire/fender
rubbing in the back, at least. If lowered "extremely" this should have been
done in front, too.

If lowered, the car will tend to "bump steer" more unless the steering rack
has also been adjusted through installation of proper spacers. With stock
torsion bars, there will also be less suspension travel available before it
snubs up against the bump stops. Caster and camber adjustment in the
alignment is more critical also. Many of the lowered cars I've seen have a
tendency to wear the inside edges of their front and rear tires even more
than the usual tendency. But....... gee, it looks sexy lowered that way!

Handling: Every 911 ever made has a tendency to exit a corner backwards if
driven wrong. Installing wider rear wheels and tires just provides a larger
margin with which to play before getting in such a predicament. Your 9"
wheels will be fine for everyday street driving. If you plan to do any
serious twisty bits, consider putting 225/50 tires on the front. These will
reduce a tendency to understeer (plow straight ahead) in slower corners.

3. Sun roof: This won't be a problem if the seals are good.

4. Maintenance: These cars are like great women, expensive as hell to
maintain, and certain to make other people in your life jealous. Plan to
spend twice as much on maintenance as you think you will in your first year
of ownership, and you should be about right. Also, there are those "little
touches" that personalize the car that you find you just can't live
without. More BEF.....

The most probable initial large unexpected expense you will find at the
mileage on the car you're considering is a new clutch. If the selling shop
serviced the car, find out if they put a clutch in it anytime in the last
30k klicks. If they serviced it, and won't make their records available to
you, run, don't walk to the nearest exit. Other possible expenses at this
age and mileage include new brake rotors (Replace the brake pads
immediately unless they're new), shock absorbers, a battery, CV joints and
rear axle shafts if the car's been driven in a spirited manner for long.
(BTW, the axle shafts can be turned end-for-end and lubed to get more life
from them.)

Conclusion: If fiction involves, as someone once said, "the willing
suspension of disbelief", then Porsche onwership involves at least a good
dollop of the willing suspension of sanity and reason. Find it, buy it,
enjoy it. The rest is just details.

Enjoy!
