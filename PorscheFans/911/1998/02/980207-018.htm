As best as I can work out, the year model 72 and 73 S cars had engine 
type 911/53 for manual gearbox and 911/63 for sportomatic. The 
engine type is stamped onto the horizontal surface to the right of 
the fan housing support. 

The engine serial number is stamped just to the left of the type 
number on the vertical of the fan housing support.

Serial numbers for 72 model cars ranged from 6310001 for the cars 
built in late 71(though my guess is 631001 included all 71 S engines. 
The differentiator will be the engine type. 71 model cars were 
911/02) to 6322586 for the cars built in 72. This was for manual
transmission. The Sporto's serial numbers ran from late 71build cars 
at  6319147 until 72 build cars kicked off at 632900.

hope this helps
