Does the frequency of the clicking proportional to engine speed?
If so, then:

I would check the CV joints.  I've seen them make noise under the
exact conditions you describe.  In my case, I was able to remove
them, clean 'em and repack 'em and the sound went away (this
was on a 944, but I think it should apply to a 930 also...)

Good luck,
