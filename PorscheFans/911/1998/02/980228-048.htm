A upgrade air filter will only increase power if it can do all of the =
following:

1- Obviously, increase air flow into the engine.
2- Provide cool air into the intake manifold.  At least as cold as it =
was before the upgrade.
3- Provide even flow through the oxygen sensor without creating =
turbulence that will lead the sensor to "believe" that a different =
amount of air is going into the engine than it actually is.

Most air filter upgrades that eliminate the factory airbox fail to meet =
step #2, therefore providing no HP gains or actually decreasing =
performance.

When step #3 is not met, the car idles rough, mileage per gallon is =
affected and you can even get pre-detonation or knocking.  Which also =
means no HP gains.  The filter upgrades that eliminate the factory =
airbox will also be the ones to irritate this situation the most.=20

The last issue will only affect performance in the long run.  That is, =
how well the filter actually cleans the air that flows through it.

Hope this helps sort things out.
Luis
