 Gregory Deschodt, you need to buy a new shift knob.  

From day one until somewhere later than your '83 (maybe part of the
change to the C2/964?), the shift knobs were a press fit, with no
screws or other fasteners.  People writing of fasteners talk of prying off
something to get at a screw, but the early knobs aren't made this way.  I
eventually came across a picture in the factory manual showing the shift
lever held in a soft jawed vice, with the knob being driven off, and a new
knob being driven back on with what looked like a plastic pipe (so you
could get a soft grip on the round head) and a hammer.  

Folks on this list have said they have done this with the lever in the car
without ill effect.  This imposes stresses on the pivots in a 915 shift
tower they aren't particularly designed or suited to take, so the cautious
way would be to follow the factory procedure even though likely nothing
bad would happen (didn't happen to those who wrote).  This also allows
you the opportunity to inspect some things, like the plastic ball cut, for
wear, and perhaps do a little lubricating.  On the other hand, you don't
have to pound with a 20 lb sledge to get the new knob on (and your old
one is already off), so it's probably safe and a lot quicker to do it in the
car.
