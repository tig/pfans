Autoweek had an article a few months ago about the 993 turbo, in it they
mentioned that the ride seemed  harsher and the handling not as good as they
had remembered, it then came out the  car they had had the Pirelli P zeros and
that the Bridgestones the other test cars (the same tires on all the cars
tested by magazines, but my car got P zeros dammit) had supposedly rode and
handled better, the reason for equipping some cars with the Pirellis is they
wear better, aftre spending this kind of money on a car don you think I care
about tire wear?  Other than the cost of tires there is little downside to
using a 993 turbo as a daily driver in my opinion see my web page at
