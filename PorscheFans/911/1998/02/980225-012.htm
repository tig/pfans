>I just bought a 1987 3.2 Carrera coupe (G.P. white/olive green-gray) with

>As replacement tires, I'm considering:

>1. Dunlop Sport 4000
>2. Yokohama A509 (these two were recommended by Burt at Tire Rack)
>3. Yokohama AVS S1-Z (recommended by three members of the NW Chapter of the

>4. Pirelli P6000 Sport Veloce

You may not be too late to get in on the close-out of Dunlop  D40 M2s.
These are outstanding tires, work great on 911s, and are in the same price
range as the others you're contemplating--or less.

Try Tire Rack, Discount, etc.
