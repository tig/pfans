Fellow Pfans and Jeff Cedrone,

I have an 83 SC with 91,000 miles and am looking for more information re:
the following post:

Was it something your mechanic noticed when doing a valve adjustment/routine
maintenance, or was
it the way your car is running?  I am simply curious and was wondering if
there are symptoms of broken/pulling studs that can be diagnosed without
opening the
engine (i. e. for a valve adj).

If you have the valve covers off, from what I understand it is quite
apparent when one of them breaks as it is laying there or falls out when you
take off a cover.

Any thoughts out there Pfans on broken/pulling studs and tell tale symptoms?
Sounds, leaks, erratic this erratic that, etc.


Thanks in advance.
