	I was wondering if there are any adverse affects involved with
removing the engine cover of a 993.  It seems that people recommend doing
it, but I wonder why it is there if there are no problems without it and
the engine is better cooled without.  I noticed last weekend while winding
my C4S through the streets of Manhattan that my car seemed to be running a
bit hotter than it usually did, with the trusty temperature gauge in the
middle of the 2nd marking (basically horizontal) as opposed to being
somewhere towards the end of the 1st marking.  I don't know that this
is/was a problem, but if it is and something can be done, I'm all for it!
