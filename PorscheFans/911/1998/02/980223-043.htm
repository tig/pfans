Hey,
I am still undecided about which tensioners to use. I am looking in
Performance Products and the prices are as follows.
1)original $140 ea.(has these now)
   a)rebuild kit $25 ea.
2)Carerra update kit $510(complete with covers)
3)mechanical $62 a set

I will only drive this car (1975 911S) about 100 miles a month and maybe
auto cross. I was thinking that mechanicals would need adjusted quite
often but I love to tinker, so maybe that will give me something to do
when I'm done restoring it. How often do they need adjusted?
  I know I can't afford to do the update to pressure fed right now.I was
thinking about the rebuild kit for the originals. the tensioners were
replaced prior to sale with new originals so they shouldn't need
replaced. I just can't decide! 
  Also I am thinking about headers and straight pipes with resonator
tips. Would this be to loud for a street car? I had another car(with a
mid-engine) that had that set-up and it was almost annoying.(almost  [-:
)But I've never heard a 911 set-up like that.
  Thanks for all the advice in the past and future.
 

later,
 Shawn
