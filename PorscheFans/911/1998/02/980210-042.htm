Hello P Folks;

I've been a quiet member of the list for member for several
months...what a great source of information.

I am a 2 year owner of a  73 911T.  I took the car for a short spin when
the Michigan roads were dry and I noticed when I applied the brakes the
dash turn signal lights "dimly" appeared ????  Then, as I pulled into a
gas station, I noticed the turn signal lights were actually lighting as
I looked into a glass door.   What's really odd is that the car started
fine and the battery appears to be fine.

Any suggestions of where to start?  I hate giving the shop $$$ if its
just something like a relay-thing-what-do-you-call-it......Thanks in
advance!
