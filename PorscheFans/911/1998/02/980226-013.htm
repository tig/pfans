Glass is my business, so here's my .02:  If the scratches/imperfections are
deep enough to feel with your fingernail, SORRY.  No fix.  If you'r talking
about a haze, it IS possible to polish the windshield.  You need a hard felt
wheel(the one I use is about 3" diameter, 2" thick, fits in a rotary
drill-preferably variable speed cordless), cerium oxide, and a lot of
PATIENCE.  The cerium oxide can be found in some hobby shops that supply
lapidary hobbiests.  The felt wheel...check a local glass company, see if
they could get one for you, or check a good hardware store.  Mix water with
the oxide to make a thin paste, put some on the felt wheel, and work the
glass at LOW speed.  You do NOT want to build up heat.  If the paste starts
to dry out, use a squirt bottle with water to re-wet the area.  A little
goes a long way.  This is a SLOW process, and covering a large area takes a
while.  Cerium oxide is VERY fine, removes material VERY slowly.  One other
thing:  It is possible to POLISH a scratch you can't remove. It will be less
noticeable, but still there.  Work with the rotation of the felt wheel
parallel to the scratch, not perpendicular, and you can eliminate the
"white" frosted look of a bad scratch.  Hope this helps.
