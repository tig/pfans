I have spend a few hours this weekend trying to adjust the CO levels
in my 73 (CIS) 911T, but I have been unable to locate the 3mm Allen
screw that is supossed to adjust the mixture (I have the CIS
Adjustment Tool, a long 3mm Allen wrench).  Can someone give me an idea
where to find the adjustment screw??

Jordi,

The adjustment screw is accessed through he top of the air box through a
small hole in the aluminum casting between the fuel distributor and the
rubber boot connecting the fuel distributor air plate with the throttle
body.  With the engine in the car you can't see the hole (maybe with an
inspection mirror you could) but you can fairly easily find it by feel.  It
is easy to see if you remove the rubber boot by loosening the two ring
clamps and simply removing the boot. Obviously the engine won't run in that
condition, but you will see the adjustment hole.  You do need the correct
length 3mm Allen wrench, however, as the distance between the top of the
engine compartment and the location of the hole is limited.  Once you get
the 3mm Allen wrench in the hole you will feel it engage the Allen bolt that
adjusts the fulcrum point on the air plate up and down.  If you remove the
air cleaner and look up under the air plate you can see the bottom of the
bolt you are turning.  Turning right (clockwise) richens the mixture,
turning left leans out the mixture.  Adjust in small increments of about an
eighth of a turn at a time.  Go overly rich then return to the correct
mixture by leaning.  Do not run the engine past idle with the Allen wrench
in place as you can easily damage the air plate mechanism.  It all sounds
difficult until you do it once.  Hope this helps.
