I remember reading several posts last year about cutting about 1 inch off
the air intake on early 911's (or some other part of the fresh air intake
system) but I can't find the digest now. Would someone redescribe the
procedure? It required taking the engine out and cutting part of the air
system (not a/c related) and the result was about a 10 degree reduction in
the temp inside the passenger compartment.

I am getting a engine rebuild for my 70 911T right now and asked AJ USA if
they could do it but they don't know what I am talking about. I think
someone even said it is detailed in Bruce Anderson's book. I don't have one
and asked them to look for it but they couldn't find it.

I tried using Alta Vista to search the message archives but I would need a
login for the news server. Sure would be nice if the pfans list had a
search engine.
