Absolutely true! It's unbelievable how people stand on stereotypes more
than analyze true facts. 964 had a completely redesigned frame with a huge
improvement in strenght due, also, to the transmission tunnel, implemented
for the C4 but present in all 964 line. The introduction of springs instead
of torsion bars was another big revolution. Obviously the weight increased
but not so badly, considered the parallel increase of power. 993 was the
refinement (both mechanical and aesthetical) of a 964, excellent but not so
revolutionary as a 964 vs Carrera. I owned an '89 Carrera and, presently, a
964 turbo and I drove, track and road, 993s. Three beautiful cars!

I own the car since 01/97. No problem at all (I was afraid to have a fuel
pump toasted, but it was just an a/c valve noise). In the previous owner
record the car had the clutch redone at 25K and front brake disks at 25K.
Go for her!
