DOT 5 is a silicone based fluid with a higher boiling point than DOT 3 or
DOT 4.  In extreme conditions, that might be a performance advantage, but
most of your brake fade will be due to overheating your brake pads.  DOT 5
is also supposed to be non-hygroscopic (it won't absorb water from the
atmosphere) and it definitely doesn't attack most paints.

I used DOT 5 in a motorcycle many years ago with satisfactory results. 
There are two areas of controversy:

-- DOT 5 may not lubricate as well as DOT 3 or DOT 4

-- You should carefully flush the old fluid from your system, (waste a lot
of that expensive DOT 5 with extra bleeding--easy on a motorcycle/harder in
a Porsche)


You probably should move up to DOT 4 (Castrol LMA and a few other brands). 
For a small price increase you get somewhat better performance.  Back when
your Porsche was built, Castrol LMA was reserved mostly for British cars
(like my '74 Land Rover) which had natural rubber brake seals  Mixing DOT 4
with remnants of DOT 3 is supposed to be safe.
