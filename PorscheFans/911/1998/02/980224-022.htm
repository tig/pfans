I just bought a 1987 3.2 Carrera coupe (G.P. white/olive green-gray) with
sport suspension, and I am deeply in love with it. It came with Michelin
XGTV4 Sport tires (205/55 16 front, 225/50 16 rear), but they're nearly
shot. It's my first Porsche, so I don't want to buy any replacement that
doesn't suit the spirit of the car and doesn't handle almost as well. But
on I-5 between Seattle and Tacoma (which I travel frequently), those
tires/shocks are battering.

I do not plan to drive above the speed limit very often, will not be taking
curves at high g forces, and in general will not be pushing the car to its
limits. I also will not be taking it onto the track. I want to tour in it
and use it for a daily driver during good weather.

As replacement tires, I'm considering:

1. Dunlop Sport 4000
2. Yokohama A509 (these two were recommended by Burt at Tire Rack)
3. Yokohama AVS S1-Z (recommended by three members of the NW Chapter of the
Porsche Club)
4. Pirelli P6000 Sport Veloce

If you have any opinions about, or experience with, these tires, or you
think I should consider other choices, I would very grateful for your
advice. Thanks!
