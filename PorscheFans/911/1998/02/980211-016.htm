Weasel, there is just one solution: repaint the hood.
In my previous Porsche, a black '89 Carrera, I got a big stone chip on the
hood. Since I'm pretty good in this kind of works (I like to assemble top
quality 1/43 models) I tried to fill it with layers of the original paint,
then I leveled them with wet finest sandpaper, then I polished and waxed.
Awful. Absolutely awful. I brought the car to a locally appreciated paint
shop which charged me the equivalent of US$200. The work was awful (they
didn't disassemble the hood and it was devasted by small craters due to
small silicon particles not well filtered in the clean room). At last I
drove the car to Bologna (one night of ferry boat + 300 mile driving) at
the official Italian Porsche bodyshop. They also charged me the equivalent
of US$300, but the work was a piece of cake, since they disassemble the
hood, repaint the hood with the whole original factory procedure (and they
gave me a bunch of pictures documenting the process) and replaced the front
batch, previously slightly damaged; the hood seemed a perfect mirror, under
any point of view.
So, you have to go to a paint shop able to manage our kind of cars, and you
can be sure your car will return in the original shape.
