I have a full B&B system on my 90 C4.. the tip (which is about 6" long by
5" Dia. square/oval and takes a 90 degree turn) seems to have gone
missing...  I suspect it resonated off back in Wilsonville Oregon while
scaring minivans doing about Mach 10 ..... i suspect that if it hit one of
the minivans though, it would have caused endless damage, if not
alltogether boring a hole through one... (its nice to know we use quality
parts..) anyhow....  I called up B&B and I can't just order another one..
it seems as though each part is custom fabricated ("by thier craftsmen")
and I would need to send the entire muffler back for a new fitting
session.. this seems extreme.. I wonder if our B&B boys in Arizona have
ever heard of modern maufacturing methods and standardization?? what to do
now?? I called some local shops and nobody works in stainless... I was
toying with the idea of taking a Borla tip and getting a place to weld/tack
it on with the inferior mild steel.. I'm getting nervous as, just with the
tip gone, its L O U D !! .. its insane..
and i think i'll melt my rear bumper cover....

any ideas??
