There is a small amount of play (1/8 inch) in my front left wheel  as well as
some grinding like noise that I notice on braking.  I have taken the brakes
apart and they seem fine.)  I think it is fair to say it is probably the wheel
bearing (unless someone has another idea).  I looked at Haynes and it appears
that replacement of front wheel bearings are straight foward, the same as any
other car.  However, I have a 1988 Cab. and I am not sure if there are any
differences in replacement from the earlier cars.  Can anyone tell me if the
procedure in Haynes is similar on an 88.  Thanks.
