Just a note.  When I did dyno testing last year on my chipped 89 944 Turbo,
a drop-in K&N filter (not a cone filter) reduced HP by around 5 and reduced
torque by a similar amount.  We did several runs to ensure no other changes
had taken place.  Once replaced with the factory air filter, the hp and torque
went back up to their previous level.  Seat of the pants actually felt
quicker with the K&N, but the dyno showed otherwise.

A cone filter on my last car made a big difference, but it was a poorly
designed air intake tract that was replaced.

For $160, I'd ask for a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied.
Take your car to a Dynojet facility, do before and after runs and see if
it really produces the goods.  Compared to my previous car, I'd have to 
say that there are a lot of phoney HP figures flying around the Porsche
world, so be cautious, $160 is a lot of money for an air filter.

Our dyno results, if you are interested can be found at:
