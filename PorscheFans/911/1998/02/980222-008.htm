Hello everyone!

Have any of you experienced this bizarre event?  An idiot in an Acura
Integra swerved into my lane and in an effort to not hit her, I bounced off
a sidewalk (tore up my 3-piece rims and now need wheels balanced and an
alignment).  However, both of my turn signals now don't work.  Neither the
lights in the dash, nor the front or rear turn signals work (on both
sides).  The turn signal swith in the steering column still catches as if
they are working, but no lights.  I checked both fuses and they are still
intact.  Could the impact have 'jarred' loose something (I can't even begin
to think of what would control both these turn signal sets)?  I'm going to
open up my steering column and see if there is something loose in there,
but if any of you have had similar problems or suggestions, I'll be
grateful to hear it.  I'll post what I find out.

Thanks,

Troy
