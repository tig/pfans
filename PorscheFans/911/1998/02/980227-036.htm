Brad Phillips has a copy of the original Porsche build sheet for his '68
911T, and wonders what it says, making a few guesses along the way. 
I dusted off my rusty German, and took a look at a few things I had lying
around, and offer the following.  In case anyone is interested, the umlaut
often used in German is an abbreviation for an "e" following the vowl it
sits atop.  Brad left out the umlauts from his build sheet, but I'll use the "e"
since I don't know how to create an umlaut, and if I did half of you
wouldn't have it come out right over the e-mail system.

Fahrest.Nr. 118.2.0522
Fahrgestellnummer means serial number, in this case revealing that
Brad's car is what he thinks it is, and an European model at that.
Ausgel.am  22.12.67
Ausgeliefert must mean the date it rolled out of the factory.   Germans
(and other Europeans?) put the day first, so that was Dec 22, 1967.
Abnahme-Besch. 5.2.68 (handwritten)
This would be the date of sale in February, less than a month and a half
later.
Motor-Nr. 218 0095
Serial number on engine
Motor-And.-Nr. (blank)
change (Aenderung) numbers on engine (weren't any)
Getriebe-Nr  4180182-905/01
serial number on transmission and transmission type number
Getriebe-And.-Nr.  (blank)
change numbers on tranny, again weren't any
Zundschloss-Nr.  FL 343
Ignition lock number
Farbe   irischgrun 6806 C (That's Irish Green color, I believe.)
You're right about the color
Schlussel-Nr.  CC 354
Key number - were the door keys different from the ignition keys?  My
'68 is a race car so has no keys at all.
Polsterung:  Kunstl. braun
Imitation (leather?) brown upholstery
Reifen-Fabrikat  Pirelli 165-15 (Okay, I got that one. Tires, right!
Right - tire manufacturer, and tire/rim size
KD-Heft-Nr. 1252 (Could be 7252, it's handwritten)
KD must be Kundendienst (literally, customer service), so it would be a
customer service book.  Since it was numbered, perhaps that contained
warranty information specific to the car.
Wagenauslieferung 6834 (handwritten)
Car delivery number.
Sonderausfuhrung/Sonderausstattung   Sportomatic, Aussenspiegel li. 
Special equipment, it had the Sportmatic and exterior mirror, perhaps
from aluminum (li = leichtmetal?)
Handler: Fa. Amag. Schinznach-Bad
The dealer, in this case AMAG, which was the importer for all
Switzerland and was located in the town of Schinznach-Bad.
Wagenbesitzer  H. Gribi. Lengnan (handwritten)
The car owner, Mr. Gribi. (what first name this abbreviates I can't
imagine, but Switzerland is an unusual amalgamation of languages)
Lengnan.  For all I know, Herr Lengnan is a member of this list and will
say hello to Brad and be glad to know his baby is still in good hands.

Best I can do, my apologies to real German speakers.
