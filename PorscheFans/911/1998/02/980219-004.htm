My experience was worse. It took over a year for me to receive my
zeroxed copied $400 911-manuals. Lousing quality product and
incomplete.  I also had to call and get a credit becuase I had virtually
given up on every receiving the document.

Lousy service.

Hi All!
        I need to vent! Has anyone ordered a Performance Products
Sports muffler recently? I placed my order back on November when
they had a sale. I'm still waiting for it!

I keep hearing that they are comming in from Denmark. It was supposed to
ship December 30th. But its February already and no muffler. They had
actually charged me for the muffler when they shipped some t-shirts that
were in that same order. I just called to ask for a credit on the
muffler and re-order it. 

They say it will be another six weeks! How can they run a business like
that? I don't think I'll be buying from them soon...

This thing better be good!

Frustrated Lou
