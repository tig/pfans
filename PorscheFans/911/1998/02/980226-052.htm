What you say is true, Ken: 'if the oils are of the same viscosity and thus
have the same fluid flow properties..', but synthetic oils generally have
different viscosity characteristics (change in viscosity with temperature)
than standard oils. A synthetic rated a 30 weight at 100 degrees centigrade
usually flows much better at cooler temperatures than a standard oil, which
is why you see a 0W-30 Mobil 1 synthetic, but you won't find a 'standard'
oil of 30 weight that flows like a 0W oil when cold.

Now for the disclaimer: one could probably put enough viscosity extender in
a standard oil to get a 0W-30 rating, and thus have similar flow
characteristics to the Mobil 1 0W-30 at both 0 degrees and 100 degrees, but
it would not hold up well under use, and would have inferior lubricating
properties to a synthetic of the same rating.
