I would appreciate comments from those of you who have the factory
radio/cassette player in a 993.  The AM band and cassette portion in my car
work fine.  The FM is a big problem almost all of the time.  Not only in the
city, but also out in the suburbs where there usually are no reception
problems.  It sounds like one of the channels is cutting out.  Of course, when
I took the car to the dealer and the Porsche shop foreman took it for a ride,
the radio worked flawlessly.

The dealer tells me that unlike Audi, Porsche makes things very difficult when
it comes to radio complaints and replacements.  They want me to keep a log and
document when and where the radio doesn't work properly.

I don't think it is the windshield antenna or the antenna connections because
the AM works very well.  

Anybody else have similar or other problems with the factory radio?  Anybody
succeed in getting Porsche to replace the radio? 

Thanks.

Richard Kessler
