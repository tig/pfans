Neither situations described above is normal according to the Owner's Manual.  I do
not think a properly operating fuel/ignition system behaves as described above.

The hand throttle is used only during the warm up period. To start a MFI car
(engine cold) the hand throttle is set to full on. As soon as the engine starts the
throttle pedal is quickly depressed and the engine should be at about 4,500 rpm.
Then one immediately used the hand throttle to set the rpms to about 1400 ( I set
the rpms to be 2000-2500). As the engine warms up the rpms will rise. The hand
throttle is depressed to maintain the 1400 (200-2500) rpm level. This process is
repeated "until it (the hand throttle) is finally pushed fully down".

Finally is the operative word here. This process could take a longtime at 32 deg.
F. I usually quit when the engine idles smoothly. This could easily take 5 minutes
at 32 deg.

One thing is certain. When the engine has reached normal operating temperature (oil
thermostat opens at about 180 deg F) the engine should idle smoothly at about
800-1000 with the hand throttle full off.



There are many  causes of  poor idle behavior. Some are trivial and some are rather
expensive to fix. When MFI units go bad, they almost always run too rich.  This is
not good as fuel gets into the oil and lubrication can be compromised. The first
thing to do is smell your oil (at the filler tube) and see if you detect raw
gasoline in the oil.

Possible problem areas include:

Simple mis-adjustmet of throttle linkage or hand throttle cable

MFI cam section broken (this was my problem and the idle circuit was jury rigged in
the most hideous manner by the P.O. - or someone in his employ - to obtain an ugly,
rich idle; I had the entire unit rebuilt and recalibrated)

MFI injection valves need rebuild

MFI mixture mis-set

Idle on MFI mis-adjusted

Thermo-limit switch

MFI micro-switch failure

Air flow on throttle bodies mis-adjusted

MFI thermostat not working  (very common)- this can be due to dirt and grime; I'd
bet Walker's report that it can take up to an hour before he can completely return
the hand throttle off is related to the MFI thermostat (see below)

MFI - atmospheric pressure sensor (barometric cell) stuck due to dirt and grime

Heat tube from driver's side heat exchanger leaks or is blocked... or the heat
exchanger itself leaks. This tube carries heat to the MFI thermostat

Ignition timing off or distributor not working properly

Throttle bodies are worn and leaking.

If ignored behavior described by Derek and Walker could lead to more $$$$ repairs.
MFI is delightful when everything is right. Once made right, MFI tends to stay
right for a long time.  Many people convert to carbs. I think this is a mistake as
it rarely costs more than a carb conversion to get the MFI running right. MFI works
better than carbs. If this was not so, Porsche would not have used MFI on their
racing cars.
