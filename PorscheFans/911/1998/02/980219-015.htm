Morning,

Sorry for the urgent notice, but if I could get an answer fast it might
save me lots of install $$$. 
I bought a set of H4s for my 83 SC. The trim rings are being painted as
we speak, and I was hoping to have by now installed the H4s myself.
Well, call me stupid, but I can't - or I am afraid to insist and break
something. The H1s are attached with 4 screws, but when I try to install
the H4s (only one screw and 2 adjusting screws), I believe one of the
screws on the H4 that are used for adjusting the headlights touches a
piece of metal where the old H1 used to bolt on, so I can't push it all
the way in. Is that common ? Should I just bend that thing and forget
about it ?  A guy at the paint shop told me h4s were a bitch to install,
and I thought I knew better..hmm...guess he was right.. Do you have a
tip before I go have it done (at great expense I'm sure) ? 

Also, I gave them an h1 trim ring to match the paint, so currently I
have one uncovered H1 and it's raining cats and dogs out there. I know
there's a drain hole, but the electrics are exposed..... is that safe ?
I haven't used the headlights because of this... 


TIA !   Greg.
