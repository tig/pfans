I have a question for the collective wisdom of the list.

A friend of mine may be selling, and I'm contemplating buying (actually
taking over a lease on), a '97 993 Targa with 8000 miles on it.  I've heard
varying views on the car, from the demand is far greater than the supply
and therefore they're worht a lot of money, to they're the least desirable
of the 3 body configurations, and therefore I should stay away. 
Someone even said that they have no better structural rigidity than the
Cabriolet, which seems unlikely, but it was someone at a Porsche
dealership.  What do you think?  What would be a fair price for such a
car - it has the motorsound package, carbon fiber brake handle and
whatever else was carbon fiber with that package, cool looking
aluminum gauges, titanium (or looks like it) shift knob and parking brake
handle end, supple leather seats and premium Porsche stereo system,
with a single CD slot.  TIA for the opinions.
