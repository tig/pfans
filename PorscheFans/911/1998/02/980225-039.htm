Got my starter problem solved, thanks to the people who responded, I got
a number of good ideas as to how to diagnose it. Basically I checked the
wiring by running booster cables direct from the battery to the starter
(both ground and positive) and tested the solenoid operation by making a
jumper to bring power to the solenoid directly from the positve cable.
No change in performance.
Finally used both of my brain cells and tested the voltage across the
battery terminals......10.2 volts, means my battery was toast. Bought a
nice new Optima 800 and everything worked fine. Just have to get the
shift linkage adjusted and I am ready for the road.

Thanks to all......

Original Message......

Just got the engine (and newly rebuilt transmission, complete with
Quaife and 7/31 rear axle etc etc) back in the car and I am perplexed by

a problem....

The starter will not turn the engine over at more than about 10 rpm (aka

very slowly) with spark plugs removed (I am trying to get some engine
oil circulating after its one year enforced hibernation).

I checked the valve clearance before putting the engine back in.....had
to turn it over by hand and had no problem, so I don't believe I have an

engine siezure or some such disaaster.

There were no starting problems prior to the engine removal

Battery has been on charger for 2 days and specific gravity of battery
acid indicates full charge.

Other electrical components (ie headlamps etc) appear bright and seem to

have no problems

Engine ventilation fan seems to be operating at full speed (wondered if
I had a ground strap problem)

Any ideas???

Thanks for any suggestions you may have......
