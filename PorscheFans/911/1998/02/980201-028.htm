I have a problem with the wipers in my 86 Targa.  The intermittant wiper
doesn't always work...it seems to be "counting" or whatever it does to time
the movement, but the blades don't actually move.  If I put a little pressure
on the switch on the steering wheel column (pressure meaning push them towards
the on position slightly, but not fully on) then they work.  When you first
turn the switch (the one on the dash) to turn on the int-wipers, they usually
run across the windsheild once before it starts "timing" them every x
seconds...it has stopped doing that (ie, you turn the knob and
nothing...unless I put slight pressure on the steering column wiper switch,
then it makes that first "run" across the windsheild).

Also just normal wiper operation (non-intermittant) they will sometimes stop
halfway across the windshield or various other places...and putting slightly
pressure on the the switch lets them continue.  I've noticed bumpy roads cause
them to start and stop at various places across the windshield also.

Anyone run into this before?  Is it just dirty contacts on the switch in the
steering column?  If so, how do you take it apart to clean it?  Maybe a loose
wire at the fuse box?

Any tips would be appreciated!
