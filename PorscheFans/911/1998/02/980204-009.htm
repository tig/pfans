Hi, PorscheFans,

I've recently decided that it's time to move up in the world and collect
another Porsche in addition to my most excellent 84 944 NA guards
red/black.  I've used my 944 on the track for driver's ed and untimed
events and have it decked out with 5 points, etc. I may end up seriously
reinforcing it for the track and using the 911 as a daily driver (except in
the rain, then I'd probably pull out the 944). If I found the right car,
I'd consider detailing it out and entering it in concours competition. I
was looking for a cabriolet until I came across a most unusual car. 

I've found a 1994 Speedster, 28k, guards/black, beautiful condition. It has
a few tiny stone chips, discolored door pulls, and a 1 1/2" tear in the
front driver's edge of the fiberglass cover that covers up the cabriolet
top when it's down. The dealer wants $47,800 for it. 

My question is, I am not very familiar with the Speedster line and there
are not enough sales of them to get a blue book on them.  Even Dupont
Registry has none this month.  Maybe there's something about them that
makes them undesirable? Are 94 Speedsters generally reputed to be good
cars, buggy, or indifferent? Common problems? Is it worth trying to snap
this one up, or should I wait for an ordinary cabriolet? Is this a good
price?  I have a great mechanic so am not worried about that part.  I'll
appreciate any and all comments about Speedsters.

TIA,

Where am I going, and what am I doing in this handbasket?
