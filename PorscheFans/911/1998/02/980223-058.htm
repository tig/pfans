Bill Lamb asks some good questions about cam timing.  Bill, you must be
an engineer used to moon rockets where you've got to get it just right
first off.  Just dive in and you'll sort it out as dummies like me eventually
did.

1) You do the timing while rotating the crank clockwise (its normal
direction) to keep all the play working as it would with the engine
running.  For instance, you keep the backlash out of the intermediate
shaft gears that way.  After checking the timing once, you have to rotate
twice to get back to same place to check it again to confirm the good or
bad news.  Or, if you reset it, you need to turn it to see if that came out
right.  Fact is, you can cheat while doing this and move crank other way
while fiddling around, or wondering if you are a tick off of TDC, but when
you think you've got it, check with doing it "right."  

Also, you are not measuring and aren't interested in "total lift distance." 
All you care about is how much the valve has opened at TDC (the TDC
which comes just after the start of the intake phase of things, not the
TDC which is about when the spark goes off).

2) You point out that the dial indicator shaft is not going to be coaxial to
the valve, and that is going to introduce a geometric error in all this.  Quite
true, and I wondered about that.  Don't worry, it works.  First off, you are
only interested in a quarter of an inch of travel at most.  Second, that's
how the factory calculated things I think, so the same error is present in
the specs and it cancels, so to speak.  

As to where to put the tip of the indicator, there is a flat on the top of the
valve spring retainer.  Put it there.  Then watch as you open the valve.  If
it slips off the narrow flat, adjust it so it starts on the other side of the
little flat.  It doesn't move sideways that much.

3) You don't need to torque the nut after each adjustment.  You do need
to tighten it down, but save the considerable effort (before the mid-SCs
the torque is 104 or so pounds/feet, which is a pain) of really torquing it
each time.  With luck, when you have it right at last, the final torquing
won't change things.

Some torque is essential, however.  There is a good 0.020 play or more
in each setting - the pin is not some sort of micrometer setting device.  So
you need to hold the setting with the cam holder while tightening the nut
enough so that the nut is keeping things in place, not the pin.

To make all this easy, you want to time things with only the #1 intake lifter
in place, and then the #4 (or vice versa), which comes naturally if you
have had the cam holder off to get at a head or do a rebuild etc. 
However, if you are retiming with the engine together (as after replacing
only a chain, for instance) and don't want to remove all those other
lifters, it can be done.  Just harder.

4)  Don't worry about which way to move the pin.  Engine rotates
clockwise, cam rotates counterclockwise, but it is the gizmo behind the
cam chain wheel which is keyed to the cam, and not the chain wheel,
etc.  It'll drive you nuts.  There is a much easier way to do this.   You've
got a dial indicator staring you in the face.  After your initial setup, just
turn the cam with the cam holding tool with the pin out until the indicator
reads what you want it to, find the hole the pin will go in, insert, tighten
nut, and you are there or pretty close.  

5) Just go through the setup like the books say to get started:  install and
set the valve lash on the #1 intake rocker, and set up your dial indicator
so it reads 0 and has a quarter of an inch of travel or so depending on
your spec (anyway, so it has some more than you will need)  before it
looses contact with the valve retainer.  Using the distributor to help, get
to #1 TDC (pulley Z1 lined up with case centerline, which is the mark on
the fan housing), rotate both cams so the dots are up, insert pins, and
tighten the nuts a bit. ( If the distributor was removed, don't worry.  Set
cam timing and then put the distributor in.)  This should set the cam so it
is closed at the start of the power stroke.  Rotate the crank one turn to
TDC again.  If all was set up right, this should result in the dial indicator
not budging until it starts moving up as TDC approaches, and when you
stop at TDC it will be somewhere in the neighborhood of the number you
want (and the dots will be down).  The cam is just starting to open the #1
intake (intakes start opening a bit before TDC - a CIS might be open
0.040" at that point, my racing cams are open 0.225" at the valve).
If this is what you see, you've got the setup in the ballpark.  If something
else is going on, you need to rethink it.

Assume you are shooting for 0.075" (I forget what the S cam spec is,
although once I used one in an engine), and you end up with 0.050 on
the dial.  While this means your cam isn't opening enough at this point,
and you need to turn the cam countercloskwise some (if I've got that
right), who cares.  Just remove the nut, turn the cam one way watching
the dial, if that is the wrong way, turn it the other until the needle points
to 0.075.  Put the pin in whatever hole works, put nut on, tighten, and
rotate two turns to see how close it comes out.  If it is where you want
it, or close enough (factory gives a range, although I've always felt it
must be nice to get the second cam within a few thousandths of the
first), torque it down, recheck, and move on.

As you can see, this implies that the crank didn't move from TDC while
you were fiddling with the cam.  To insure this you need to hold the cam
carefully  and firmly with the holder while loosening the nut (another
reason not to tighten it all that much), and again while tightening it until it
is tight enough so that the chain wheel and cam won't move against
eachother.  At that point it doesn't matter if while tightening a bit more you
move the crank via the chain.

If all those other lifters are in there, you can still do it this way, but it is
harder because you have other valve springs trying to make the cam
move if you let loose of it for a moment.  That's where you may need to
do a bit more cut and try, and may want to figure out which way things
move so you can move a pin hole at a time, but just use the dial indicator
for feedback as you develop a scheme.

Also, as a refinement you can try inserting the pin and relaxing your grip
on the holder.  This may cause the dial indicator to fall, as the spring
pushes the cam down via the lifter until all the slop in the pin holes is
taken up.  You can then try to reset at the next higher lift in the next pin
hole (using your dial to figure this out) to see if this relaxation will get you
where you want to be with the pin basically doing the holding before the
nut is tightened.  That way, when you tighten things the pin should be at
the right edge of its range so if somehow the pressure from the fully
torqued nut isn't holding things, the pin will without any timing change. 
Low CIS lifts are easier to deal with, as the spring isn't pushing that hard,
but wth racing lifts you have to work harder to hold things still and there
may be more virtue of having the pin help.  I have given up trying to do
this, but if you can get the numbers you want this way, have at it.  I
figure if the chain wheel tries to move after full torque on the nut you are
in trouble anyway, and this is an additional pain, especially since you
won't always be able to get this "ideal" position at the lift you want.  But
perhaps I am getting lazy.

6) The chain goes counterclockwise, so you want the master link clip to
go on so if it hits anything it will be forced on rather than off the link.  This
bit of wisdom comes to us, I believe, from folks with motorcycle
experience where foreign objects can more easily get at the chain.  It
certainly is prudent to do it this way, but if you put things back together
and realize you put one of the clips on wrong, I'd not loose sleep over it. 
There is absolutely nothing in there it can hit, and if something gets in
there which can hit it, having the clip come off is the least of your
worries.  Maybe if a tensioner fails, but even then the movement hould
be up and down, not sideways where it can brush something.

My first one took quite a while before I satsified myself I had it right, but I
did and it worked fine.  A dozen times or more later I can usually get it on
the second try (on an engine stand - "ideal" rebuild condidtions):  dots,
check, adjust, check, torque, check, move on,  and write this from my
head.  In between, well, some went better than others (like the time I
timed it as the intake was closing instead of opening - a self correcting
error as I installed more lifters and couldn't turn over the engine).

So don't think about it too much.  You have done plenty of homework. 
Have at it.

Walt Fricke (hoping his 3.0 will fire right up later this week after these
brave words - always a moment of truth)

p.s. - you really do want to have the right tools for this, although I have
seen reports on the List of people's successes with some makeshift
stuff, so that must be possible.  Also, I haven't had the pleasure of
owning one of the later engines where a smaller bolt holds the chain
wheel to the cam (?) instead of the bigger and more highly torqued and
awkward nuts.  But the procedure has got to be pretty much the same.
