Hi Kerry,

As I mentioned in an email to you earlier today, here is the condensed
solution:

1.  Purchase a car with an arm rest and all the other things that you so
desire.  Since you are going to own the car for quite awhile, be comfortable
with your choice.

And I know that I am going to get flack for the next question, as this is a
mostly male-generated thread, but if you still have the urge to drive the
NSX after purchasing the 2nd Porsche:

2.  Does he occasionally nap in front of the TV?  Hmmmmmmm?   lol

I apologize for misreading your original note indicating your wishes for a
speedster.  My mind was obviously on my car.  I think most would agree that
any style of Porsche is worth it!
