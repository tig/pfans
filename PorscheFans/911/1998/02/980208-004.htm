The 911 Evolution Screensaver from Porsche Zentrum Munich gives another
interesting perspective on the latest 996 styling.  They have adjusted the
graphic images to fit the same relative wheelbase, so the images (particularly
the 996) are not quite correct.

However, when you see the screen overlays transitioning from the original 901
through the G-body (74-89), the 964, and finally the 993, you get the
impression of an artist with an airbrush (or rapier) "freshening up" the
styling to maintain contemporary advances.

When the images changes from the 993 to the new 996, however, you get an
entirely different impression...it's as if a "Frankensteinian Monster" has
ruthlessly yanked the 993 at the front end while at the same time crushing the
rear half downward and pulling a "garishly overly tail-lighted and shortened"
rear section upward.  It reminds me of the Saturday Cartoons where characters
change via "Transformers" from recognizable creatures to Robotic Monoliths.
The closest I can envision is a 911 being pushed down by a hydraulic Crusher
at a Junkyard.  Again, the final image is not an attractive one for the 996
and I believe the wheels are oversized and the body too short as shown.

If this evolution had been shown to an Customer Design Clinics, I believe the
rear end design in particular would have been shouted off the screen.  Porsche
Zentrum Munich (and Porsche AG) might want to relook at this
screensaver...it's an unfavorable view of the 996 (IMO).

Perry
(Still believing that in 3-5 years the 996 will be "The 911" in our general
viewpoints...nonetheless, I'll hold on tightly to my 993/911!)
