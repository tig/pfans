>Hey,
I listened to the noise with a stethescope and it seems to be coming
from the timing chain housing on the left side. I suppose from what I've
read thats a tensioner getting ready to go. So here come the questions.
1)What style should I use?
     a.original
     b.hydraulic
     c.mechanical

I had a similar problem in my '68 911T. The reason the noise is only
coming form the left hand side is because the clearance is a little less
on that side, I can't remember why or at least what was the gadget
responsible for this reduced clearance. The job can be done with the
engine in the car, even replacing the chains. If the PO replaced the
chains when he rebuilt the engine I don't think it necessary, this
question depends also on how much money you have and how paranoid you
are (I replaced my chains for reason two).

My car did not have the slightly updated tensioners (at last count I
think there have been about 5 versions) only three are really
significant changes (correct me if I am wrong). The earliest version aka
mine could not be rebuilt, so I had to upgrade on step to rebuildable
tensioners, which would be cheaper in future when they failed or go for
the Carrera pressure fed tensioners, both cost the same. I obviously
went for the pressure fed, which I would advise you to do. This visible
(and useful) change  will certainly help when/ if you sell your car.

Good luck
