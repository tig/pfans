Hi Mike:

   Good Question!  The CIS pistons seem to work OK with just bolting on
the carburetors and not much else. When adjusted correctly, they run
just fine and make the stock CIS-type engines feel much sharper due to
improved throttle response.

Those CIS piston domes were made as a swirl-inducer to help the engine
run better with the lean mixtures required for emissions regulations.
The Porsche hemisphercal combustion chambers have very little natural
swirl
patterns and those offset domed pistons on CIS-equipped imparts some
additional motion to the incoming mixture. This also helps maintain some
detonation resistance as well, due to those lean mixtures.

The offset domes do not work with camshafts having much lift or overlap.

Piston-to-valve clearance problems will occur if cam profiles above a
"T" or SC are used. You also cannot remove much metal from the bottoms
of the cylinders to gain compression, either.

Nothing's ever cheap, :^(

Hope this helps,
