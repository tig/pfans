Hi Kerry, Buy it, enjoy it and don't worry about it. It gets wet
occasionally but it also dries out. I have an 89 with 71K miles and
drive almost every day to work and back. Living in Georgia we get our
share of rain but the leaks are not that bad. I have had no problems
with the car and no significant expenses. The top stitching deteriorated
some, had it re-stitched and the rear window replaced all for $408.
Incidentally the top stays down most of the time and when parked at work
I cover it with the cab cover. I made a few modifications to the top
where the top/windshield/windows meet by installing some rubber drip
strips which has reduced the top leaks to a minimum at that location.

Have fun, you will with this one!!
