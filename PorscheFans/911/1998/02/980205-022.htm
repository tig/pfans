Hi Scott,

I understand your concern and respect your views for what they are, yours.
With respect to my own needs when I choose to drive fast I find deserted roads
with no traffic, or entry/exits to come up on.  At that point, with no traffic
on the road I drive as I like.  If a tree falls in the woods and no one hears
it does it make noise???  If I do see traffic I slow down, drive about 5mph
faster, and always respect the other motorist for their expectations.

Anyway I was mentioning my concern that some people drive irresponsibly with
traffic present.  As that letter from Europe described a guy racing through
streets with 2 other cars.   As far as how fast is safe for a road to move
across I welcome any finite element study information you may have.  As far as
PCA events, I hope you enjoy them.  I have no need to compete, qualify, or
contest my skills with others.  I only seek the quiet solace I get from being
alone on a road, with no passangers, and only myself to drive or fly.  So I
hope you are ok with this, as well as giving women their Pro Choice rights,
and letting Clinton sleep with whoever he damn well pleases.  Cause if you do
have issues with these, then I suggest you find a faccist country that caters
to your tastes.  Maybe you should read this a few more times to catch my
drift.   Peace to you and happy motoring.  P.S.  I am happy to trade you my 71
bug for your Porsche if you really think driving fast is bad. :-)
