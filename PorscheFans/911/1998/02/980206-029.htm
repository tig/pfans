Hey,
I just adjusted my valves to get rid of a rattle.Well the rattle is
still there. It's coming from the middle to right side of the engine.I
also just changed the oil and replaced the plugs .It almost sounds like
something is loose and just kind of well rattleing. Anyone have any
rattles and found out what it was?Or is there something that is notorius
for rattleing on 911 engines? The engine runs very smooth and was
rebuilt top to bottom just prior to sale. I can't find anything that is
loose. It seems to go down the road just fine.
 All advice will be welcome. You just can't drive a Porsche that
rattles, It's not right!
:-)  

later,
 Shawn
