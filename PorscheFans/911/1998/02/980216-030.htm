*Apologies* if any of this has been covered but...
o Maintenance records - make sure mileage & date tallies
  - Dealer-Records (computerised) + Service Receipts
  - MOT-Certificates & DVLA re MOT mileage records
o ?HPI? - ring then to enquire of HP/Loan/Accident history, they may 
          have data on mileage at least at a certain date
o Interior Wear
  - Find several similar year cars (ho-ho-ho) with same mileage, lower
    mileage & higher mileage. Compare wear patterns on seat (bums), 
    pedals, floor mats, drivers footwell area, door-jam foot scrapes.
  - The list should know typical mileage visible-wear & what's 70k/80k.
  - Wheels can give an indication of the number of times tyres on/off,
    only useful with other info but gives an idea - ie, 10 or so removal
    marks from UK tyre fitters suggests an enthusiastic 50k miles!
o Independent inspection
  - Trust dealers an inch, so they fit neatly in a vice.
  - Techs usually know what ages to what extent by what mileage on say
    bushings, tie-rods etc. There will be something which gives them a
    gut-feeling it is right, or a gut-feeling something is amiss.
  - Assume it's had the usual leak-down/compression check and a nosey on
    various wear indicators in that area. Autoglass etc don't always 
    note the mileage a screen was replaced at BTW (sometimes they do).
o Previous owner contacts
  - Try to check with previous owner(s), even just to confirm mileage
    & a trick question if you find a receipt at a certain date etc.

It's mileage + maintenance + care + accident-free.
