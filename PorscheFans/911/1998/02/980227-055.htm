Bill,

Unless you are keeping the car original for concours, you should
definitely upgrade to a later front suspension.  All the mounting
geometry is identical and you can achieve a significant upgrade in
performance buying a used suspension from a wide variety of later
models.

It is not uncommon at swap meets to find complete, bolt-in suspensions
for 69+ models in the $250-600 range.  This would typically include:
struts, shocks, calipers, rotors, crossbar, tie-rods, and all related
hardware.  A thru-body swaybar set-up (basic) can be $125-300, and is
usually not included with complete used suspensions. Also, don't feel
that you have to buy a lot of trick hardware to make a real
improvement.  A stock 69-72 "S" suspenion with Koni or Boge struts would
help your car's handling: bigger brakes, vented rotors, bigger torsion
bars, etc..

The 87 struts are compatible with A or S calipers. When you make the
change, you will have some choices regarding choices of shock absorbers,
depending on what struts you buy. The "later" style struts, with the S/A
caliper bolt spacing, probably will give you the most flexibility at a
reasonable cost. Boge, Koni and Bilstein are the most highly regarded
choices for 70-mid 80s suspensions.

Following are a few of the parts you would be upgrading with a later
supension:

		Struts			Later style with S/A/Turbo bolt spacing
		Rotors			Vented
		Calipers		S (aluminum) or A (steel) calipers
		A-Arms			Heavier, better construction
		Crossmember		Aluminum (lighter)
		Torsion Bars		Heavier (stiffer spring rate)
