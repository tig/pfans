Hi all,
I have been steadily making my 911 into a car that is more liveable.
Somehow, the idiot who had the car before me had wrecked the  backend
and when he had it fixed they never put the sway bar back. Also, the
torsion bars in the rear were lowered so my Konis were bottoming out.
Anyway, I got new OEM Boge shocks in the back, had my torsion bars
adjusted and had a factory spec sway bar put in the back. Total cost
$800 ($200 Boge, $200 sway bar, brackets, pins, $400 labor). The rear is
much better now. Now I am in need of some more opinions.

Q1: My front tires were purchased in 94, rear ones are from 91. I think
it is time for a new set of tires;-) I am interested in Ultra High
performance All Weather, since I live in the Mid West. Here are my
choices 
	Tires 	2 X Front 205/15/60	2 X Rear 215/15/60
	Yokohama		AVS S4-V		$358 (Better for
daily driving, snow)
	Yokohoma		AVS Intermediate 	$414 (Best
handling but less all season)
	Dunlop 			D40M2			$320 (V rated)
	Michelin		Pilot XGT -V4		$458 (kind of
expensive)
I am leaning towards the Yoko AVS S4-V. Any suggestions. This is my
first 911 so I will be taking a couple of Driver Ed's this year and
don't want to get anything expensive that I will be replacing next year.

Q2: My front shocks are Bilsteins Struts (green). My mechanic thinks
that my whole car is very stiff. I also have very little clearance up
front. Even the back is much lower then other 911's I see. Any ideas how
a car might have been lowered in the front? Anything to do with the
shocks or torsion bars. I can replace the struts but would that further
increase stiffness?

Q3: There are two very annoying noises that come from the car when it
goes over regular city roads (not big potholes, just bad patches). First
is a high pitched squeaking noise, like a lose screw or something and
the other is a heavier thud coming from the door. I am wondering if
anyone has had similar experiences.

Q4: My driver side Window slides into a U-channel that is fitted with a
fuzzy strip. I got the strip from German Parts & restoration for $14. I
had it installed for $160! What do you guys think? Is it a little
overkill? Is it really that hard to install? I would like to hear an
opinion on this, since I am still in the formative stages of
relationship with my mechanic.

Thanks in advance.
