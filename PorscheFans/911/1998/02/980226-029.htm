John,

t definitely sounds like bushing noise (sort of a metallic "grrrnnnch", usually). You 
didn't say whether the sound happens if you jack up each front wheel (one side, check 
for sound, lower...other side, check for sound.)  I'm more inclined to suspect the 
swaybar bushings, which are smaller than A-Arm bushings and not permanently attached.  
What's likely happening when your raise one wheel is that the bar is torquing within its 
bushings, causing the noise.  They may just need lubrication.

It doesn't sound like a steering rack tooth problem.  I've seen this a couple times and 
in both cases it manifested as a slight "jump" in the steering wheen at full lock.

If it were my car, I'd start by lubricating all four front swaybar bushings; use a 
high-quality non-flow paste lubricant (graphite, etc.). If that doesn't work, then 
replace all four swaybar bushings with any of the harder compound bushings (also 
lubricated and checked for smoothness in mating areas.) The extra hardness for these 
bushings help roll stiffness, witout as much of a downside in terms of ride harshness.

As a last resort you could replace the A-Arm bushings. There are bushings made which 
more closely match the durometer of the factory rubber than do race bushings, but 
they're not exactly the same. Try Automotion and ask for their "street" compound. 

	1. Disassemble front suspension to remove A-Arms from car.
	2. Burn or cut bushings off old bushings (PITA)
	3. Make sure mating surfaces are smooth and lubricated.
	4. Install new bushing.  
	5. Check caps for irregularities. Sand/file as reqd. and lube
	5. Reassemble front suspension

With the right tools you should be able to replace the A-Arm bushings in a Saturday.

Good luck ferreting out yout groan!
