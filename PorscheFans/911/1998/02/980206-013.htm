Regarding insurance coverage.

Some insurance companies have decided to target PCA and it's DE
program and have been pulling in other insurance companies as well.

My understanding is that PCA DE program meets all the requirements
of being a Driver Education event, e.g. there is no official timing, no
winners or losers, restricted passing zones, different clases of
experience,
instructors, etc... Driver education is suppose to be covered by all 
insurance companies. Afterall, how does a 16 year old learn to drive?
Everytime the 16 year old goes out, they are trying to improve their
driving performance. Does it mean they are preparing for racing?
Everytime a PCA member takes a DE event, they are trying to improve
their driving skills, proper braking, proper cornering, etc..

This said, the insurance companies may decide to say you was preparing 
for racing. They may not be right, but this will force you into spending
a lot 
of money trying to get your coverage paid.

I personally know of two cases here in the north east, with two
different
insurance companies, where they have denied the claims. This has led
one owner through two years of legal expenses (>$10k) and the other
owner has just past the one year anniversary and many legal fees.
Neither have received anything yet, but they believe they will. Mean
while they are out a lot of money and had many sleepless nights.

On the other hand, I have seen some owners get their insurance checks
within weeks without any problem.

It is my belief, that if you have a stock car, without cage, roll bar,
harnesses,
etc... you'd have a better chance to be get a claim covered than if the
insurance
adjuster shows up and sees a race car. On the other hand, one of the
cars denied the claim was a stock '95 993 with 2000 miles, but it had
R1's.

It is also my belief that you increase your risk of claim denial if you
transition 
to club racing. Although you may be at a DE event when the incident
takes place,
how does the insurance company know you wasn't preparing for racing,
practicing?

I decided not to take the risk and have the potential headaches. I
checked
out ways to get on-track insurance and this is what I found.

PCA Club Racers and Driver Ed students can get full coverage on-track
damage protection from CRM Motorsports. Advertised in Panorama. One of
the attorneys for the cases I mentioned checked them out for me. The
insurnance covers any damage to your car, regardless of fault, during a
PCA 
Club Racing or Driver Education event. The rate is based on your
personal 
experience, days of track experience, number of incidences. You can
expect to
pay a minimum of ~$1200 for a season or ~15-20 days.

You pick the level of coverage you want, replacement value and
deductible.
The company is bonded by Loyds of London. I know a number of
Northeast racers which have this coverage and used it last year with
no problems.

This insurance does not cover you for street driving.

For more information call Mike Retter at CRM Motorsports, 
812-424-5578 x223.
Tell him Cal sent ya.

Have fun on the track, be it racing or drivers education!
