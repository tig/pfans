James_F_Dasher@email.whirlpool.com (James F Dasher) asked :

>>     IN MY '73 911, AFTER REPLACING THE REAR SHOCKS, MY RIDE HEIGHT CHANGED 
     SUBSTANTIALLY.  THE SHOCKS I TOOK OUT WERE KYB GAS CHARGED (REALLY 
     STIFF) AND THE REPLACEMENTS WERE KONI STANDARD HYDRAULIC (NOT GAS 
     CHARGED).  <<

There is something wrong here or you are missing something.
The KYBs might have 50 pounds each of gas charge max,
this should not change ride height by more than 1/2 inch.
Maybe the KYB's had a different bump stop, and you were
actually riding on the bump stops??
     
>>     WHEN I RESET THE REAR SPRING PLATE ON THE TORSION BAR, I HAD TO MOVE 
     ONE FULL TOOTH TO RAISE THE REAR UP TO THE SUGGESTED 25 INCH FENDER 
     LIP MEASUREMENT, WHICH IS WHAT THE CAR HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SET AT.  <<

That's a lot of adjustment.

>>     WITH THE SWING ARM UNATTACHED FROM THE BANANA ARM, THE SWING ARM SAT 
     AT ABOUT 7:30 ON A CLOCK SCALE, AND THERE WAS A LOT OF PRELOAD IN 
     ORDER TO ATTACH THE SWING ARM TO THE BANANA ARM - TOO MUCH FOR ME TO 
     CONSIDER IT SAFE TO DO SO.  <<

Did you check your swing arm bushings, they may be binding.
Also your torsion bar tube, it is rusty and maybe flexing?
     
>>     I'M CONSIDERING UPGRADING THE TORSION BARS FROM THE STOCK TO 27MM TO 
     OVERCOME THIS, BUT I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE HAD INPUT AS TO ANOTHER 
     PROBLEM THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR BEFORE I PURCHASE THE TORSION 
     BARS? <<

Also you must realize that it takes days of driving after changing
ride height for it to "settle" into it's new settings. Did you
drive it a while? Upgrading torsion bars will not fix your
problem, there is an underlying problem somewhere else. Keep
us informed of what you find out,
