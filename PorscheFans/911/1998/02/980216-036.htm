Jon
Thanks for your comments.  I must admit that I am reluctant to go at the
valves again, but I may have no alternative.  I'll break out my
stethoscope first.
Are you saying you have no valve clatter at all?

	I have done exactly the same thing.  I had the engine out and
CAREFULLY
	adjusted all the valves, marveling at how easy it is when the
engine is so
	exposed.  As soon as I got it all back together, I had valve
train noise
	@#$%! :)I used an automotive stethescope to help isolate the
noise and
	readjusted two of the valves (I forget which ones but they were
both on the
	same side - whatever that might mean).  Then the engine was
quiet.  Since
	then I seem to have improved at my adjusting skills.  Now when
I'm done the
	engine is very quiet.  All this to say that maybe you are like
me and
	"missed" a couple.
	As for the valves that are too tight, I have been told to worry
about that
	condition since it potentially means that the valve is being
streatched, a
	pre-cursor to failure.  I don't know what to think about this
since I have
	never experienced that condition.
