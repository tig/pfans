If you are not interest in short shift kits, you may want to punt now
or if you are interested in buying a factory short shift kit for a
911, jump to the end.

All right 930 owners, has anyone put a factory short shift kit into a
'78 or '79 930?  I have a factory short shift kit sitting in the
garage.  After taking the seats and console out of the car, I pulled
the shift tower (shift lever mount?) out of the car and started
comparing the existing shifter hardware with the factory kit.  I think
the tower for a 4 speed 930 is very different than the 5 speed for a
normally aspirated 911 because there isn't the lockout hardware for
5th/reverse.  I am suspicious of the kit application to a 930 because
very simple physics would lead me believe that the kit will actually
make the throw the same, or longer, than the current set up that was
installed in my car.  Maybe I don't have the original shift set-up for
a 4 speed 930.

Why do I think the kit would make longer throws?  A couple of
observations.  First the pivot box (I don't know if that is the
correct term for this hardware, its the heavy gauge metal rectangle
that is pinned to the shift tower front and back and allows rotation
from left to right.  The shift lever also goes through the metal
rectangle and is pinned  left to right which allows forward and
backward lever movement.).  The kit pivot box geometries have less
space between the shifter lever pin and the tower pins than the pivot
box currently installed in the car.  Effectively the new pivot box
lowers the pivot point, or fulcrum, for the shift lever.  Here is an
ASCII side view of the part (this could really be entertaining for
some with different tab settings):
                    __
       ______/ 0 \______                                        __
        |                            |                        _______/
0  \______
        X                         X
X                               X|
        |______________|                        | ________________|

           Old pivot box                                New pivot box
     0 - is the where the shift lever is pinned
    X - is where the box is pinned into the tower.


Second, the kit's lever extension (distance) from the lever pivoting
point to the end of the ball (that goes into the plastic cup) is a
1/2" shorter.  Doesn't this translate to having to move the shift knob
farther to move the business end of the shifter?

Of all the hardware included in the kit,  the lever, "pivot box", pin
for pivot box/lever, and a rubber like template (assume this is for
the top of the shift tower), is all that really applies to this
application.  I can't, or don't see the need for the: metal "fork",
springs, metal plate for top of shift tower (complete with some type
of lockout tab).

If I understand how the kit would go together in this application, I
think the net affect on the shifter makes  the lever about 1/2" lower
in the car, hence the short shift kit?.  I thought a short shift kit
was suppose to make shorter throws?:-)  My conclusion is the short
shift kit was not for a 930.  Any comments?  Anyone interested in the
kit, send me e-mail.

Randy
