I would be careful about taking this route; it's insurance fraud.  I was
talking
to one of the Watkins Glen workers last year, and he related an interesting 
story.

A NY state troooper came up to the Glen not too long after a PCA driver's
education event, asking if a certain person had been in an accident there.
Apparently the "victim" had clobbered his car big time at the Glen, loaded
it on his trailer, carried it back near home, then unloaded it and pushed it
off an on-ramp.  He then called up police to say somebody stole his car.
When they found it, apparently the accident scene seemed fishy, so the
cops did some investigating.  The Glen keeps records of any track 
accident, so it was recorded that the accident happened on-track.  I would
think the "victim" is facing a stiff fine or possibly jail time.

Al,

I once knew a guy who pranged his 911 at the 48 Hours of Watkins Glen, a PCA
DE. When he got home he submitted a claim for an accident which, he said,
"happened on
slick rural roads in upstate New York."  His claim was promptly paid...
