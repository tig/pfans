I'm a low temperature physicist who has heard about this multiple times.
All  I have heard in anecdotal in nature from multiple sources. One
example is the claim that cryogenic treatment of brake rotors ahve
significant benefits (they don't crack).

In essence, this can be thought of as another heat treatment cycle(s). I
suspect that there is something happening on a metallurgical level, but
don't have the time to pursue it. I'm not sure anyone has systematically
(academically) studied the process. The thermal cycling would be
somewhat different dempending on the alloy and appplication.

 I'd like to see someone do the systematic study. Tom why don't you go
over to the UCSD mechanical engineering department and see if you can
get someone intersested. (besides, your chancellor is also a low
temperature physicist--why don't you hit up Bob Dynes for some funding
or at least let you borrow his LTC-20 cryogenic temperature controller
<g>)

P.S.,  Tom, give me a call (550-2700) or come to the SD-PCA tech session
this Wed (7 pm) at Amato's in Sorrento Valley and we can talk some more
about this.
