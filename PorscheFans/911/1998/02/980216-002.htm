Well, we're getting close now.

Friday afternoon, I've done a brief test drive with the car. I must say
I had mixed feelings afterwards. For the record, this is my first drive
in a 911. The car is not as powerful as I expected (by that I mean
"explosive" power), but very smooth and quick. Handles well to, although
I found the steering to be heavy (probably a consequence of the very low
suspension). Overall, the car is in excellent shape. The brakes felt
very awkward. The pedal was rock hard and needed a big stomp to slow
down (see further). Starting was difficult (the after market alarm had
drained the battery while sitting in the showroom), but with an other
battery the car started immediately and without smoking. After the
testdrive, oilpressure was OK (4 when revved).

The seller agreed to have a full check up done by an official Porsche
dealer (actually the company that imports them in Belgium !).  I also
got an extra warranty. Actually, they're basing the warranty now on
mileage, not on duration, which in my case, low mileage expected, should
be favorable.

I also called the previous owner. Very enjoyable fellow who gave me lots
of info on the car. He changed it for a 92 Carrera RS (at the same shop
I'll probably be buying the 88 Carrera from), because he wanted the
Porsche almost exclusively for track events (it's also his third car,
his second is a Beetle Convertible). He told me that he only ran the car
once on a race track (the famous Spa Francorchamps F1 circuit) and then
decided he wanted a purer racer. He lowered the car for the purpose, and
changed the brake pads to racing pads (hence the awkward feel I got on
my test drive).

We also put the car on the shop's bridge and inspected the underside.
The car bottomed out with the rear sway bar (the struts were the newer,
reinforced ones). And ... I noticed three drops of oil ... HELP !!! ???.
Two at the head of the left cilinder bank, and one on a bit nut that
goes through the gearbox. DOES THIS MEAN A NO-GO ? The P.O. clearly
stated he did not have oil leaks (contrary to his Beetle he has to store
on cardboard) nor oil consumption. The seller wasn't too worried either.
Should I be ? 

The check-up at Porsche Belgium is scheduled for Wednesday, the seller
will bring the car in on Tuesday afternoon. Based on the above
information (oil drops on the engine), do you think it is still worth
having the seller bring the car and me spending 250 USD for the check-up
?
