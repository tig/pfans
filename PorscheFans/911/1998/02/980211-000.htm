In response to Weasel's question about hood scratches in his new car,
this is, pardon the pun, a touchy situation.  It's not a factory defect,
so it's up to the dealer, and if you reported it immediately they'd
probably back you up and agree that the damage occurred before you took
delivery.  Ideally it needs repainting to make it perfect, but by
definition repaint isn't perfect.  Wasn't there a case with a doctor and
a BMW somewhere in the Southeast--where he sued and got a huge judgment
for a repainted quarter panel on a new car?

For the nice-guy approach, I'd ask the service manager what he'd do if
it were his car.  A Porsche customer is expected to be fussy, and the
dealer shouldn't mind this.  Repainting is much better now than it was
in the past, and the original shine and texture is easier to duplicate
with the new urethanes.  But there's no absolute guarantee that, in some
odd light, you might not see a color difference.  Sometimes it pays to
mess with something and sometimes it's better to leave well enough
alone.  Depends on how big, where located, and all that.  Even factory
paint is not without an occasional imperfection.

Brush touching isn't necessarily "horrendous."  It is possible to touch
up a small scratch so that the paint only fills the scratch, and this
might be a better option than repainting.  You could ask the dealer to
pay you his cost for a repaint, then deal with or live with it as you
see fit.  In NYC you'd be lucky if this is all that ever happened to it,
but admittedly no one wants to start out this way.
