I also have an '87 carrera and changed the O2 sensor last year with a bosch
lamba sensor that I ordered from German Parts and Restoration- 800-321-5432. I
think I paid around $60. It's the same bosch unit (3 wire) that you have now
except without the connector attached. It was a pretty easy job to change it
out. Just soak the heck out of the old switch with penetrating oil the night
before you do the job. Let me know how it goes. 
Regards, Ernie

Subject: Oxygen Sensor Info

I think I recall a thread pertaining to the Oxygen (Lambda) Sensor.  I
also seem to recall someone mentioning the use of generic aftermarket
Oxygen Sensors instead of the Porsche part (which, BTW, is $161.70).

I need to replace my sensor, so I would appreciate it if everyone would
send me their inputs on that thread.  I was going to search the
archives, but I can't remember the actual dates of the digests :-(  Man,
I need an archive search tool (other than grep :-).
