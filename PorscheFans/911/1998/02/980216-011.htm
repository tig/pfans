I watch the P-Fans list for MFI problems.  Once in a while I know
some of the answers and the rest of the time I try to learn them.

Recently someone asked about MFI information.
Porsche published a MFI Supplement.  The cover says: Check, Measure, Adjust.
I believe the part number is: 4532.20

It describes the unit thoroughly and gives some adjustments.

Idle probems.
I have owned a unit whose throttle shaft bores leaked so much air that they
allowed enough air into the motor below the throttle butterflies that they
became the idle adjustment.  This gave me weird idle air adjustments.
Check em!  In fact mine leaked so much air that I had to disconnect the fuel
shut off relay. The shafts can be rebushed. Often the bottom of the 
butterflies collect a lot of carbon.  This isn't unusual when you think of
the fact that they are operating just a couple of inches from the backside
of the intake valve. You can clean them with some spray carb cleaner and
wiping cloths. Also a shot in the idle air adjustment needle holes
probably would be a good idea.  This makes sure that this adjustment would 
have some affect. They could be clogged with carbon too.

Fuel pump relay electrical problems.
According to my unbiased kitchen table testing, that little black round Bosch
relay that Porsche uses, takes at about 10.5 volts signal voltage.  Very often 
when cranking, the relays located there in the engine compartment don't have 
enough voltage.  Check em! Remember that this system is almost 30 years old.
I replaced at least one of these fuel related relays with a 9.5 volt 
Radio Shack relay. Works fine!

I hope all of your projects are coming along nicely.
