The wipers on my 72T have failed.  They had seemed extremely weak and
sometimes would need to be "push started."  They seemed to run a little
stronger at higher rpms, I guess due to higher voltage(?).  At this
point I'm trying to determine if the problem is with the switch and/or
the motor.

I pulled the motor/linkage assembly from the car and disassembled the
motor.  The commutator had some build up so I cleaned the motor
internals and reassembled.  Still doesn't work.

I measured voltages at connections to the motor and with the wiper
switch OFF got 12.5 V at the black wire (from the cap mounted under the
dash - shows R/W in Haynes), 12.5 V at the blue wire,  12.5 V at the B/P
wire and 12.5 V at the B/Y wire.  When I turned the wiper switch to
position 3 I got exactly the same voltages.  Assembly ground is good. 
Is this correct?

Any help or shared experience much appreciated,

Andy
