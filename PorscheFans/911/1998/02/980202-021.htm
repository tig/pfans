Well I have a relatively simple question for everyone.  At least simple
for someone besides me.  I saw in the paper the other day that there is a
82 911 SC for sale.  I have also been seeing a lot more SC's for sale
recently, and have been bitten by the Porsche bug.  I am looking to sell
my current car and then purchase a 911.  The price range will have to be
no more than $15,000 so that makes it kind of tough, but I have heard that
there are good deals to be found for this price.  I would like to know
what I need to look in the car that is for sale, and other cars before I
make a purchase.  I am most interested in the 78-83 SC's, and any info
about purchasing a used one would be very appreciative.  Thank you very
much for your time and help.
