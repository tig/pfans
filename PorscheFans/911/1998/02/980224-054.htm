Go for the pressure fed tensioners.  I was able to procure a perfect
upgrade "kit." for around $350.00 a couple years ago.  Call around.  To
my knowledge, all these kits are the same anyway - original Porsche
part.  Any other solution will be temporary.  

Original tensioners can fail even on a car that is driven sparingly. 
Mechanical tensioners can damage your engine if not set properly and
will require much "tinkering" to keep them set.  Either of these
"cheaper" solutions will not last forever.  Each increases the risk of
expensive damage happening to your engine.  Finally, each will cost you
more in the long run.

Get the Pressure fed tensioners and sleep more easily.
