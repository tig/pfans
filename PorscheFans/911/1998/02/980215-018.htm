I've got the oil tank off my 72 911.  While cleaning it off to repaint it I 
removed the plug that is next to the drain plug ( I guess it goes to an 
external oil cooler which my car doesnt have).  Well, inside this plug was oil 
mud about 2 inches deep.  Also, there seems to be alot of very black residue 
throughout the tank.

Now I'm wondering if the tank should be flushed? If so, how should it be done:
steam cleaned (putting water in it doesnt seem like a good idea), some kind of 
solvent.

You may have noticed several other posts of this nature by me.  I am a zealous 
back yard mechanic who loves to learn about his baby (and asks lots of stupid 
questions).  This list has been an invaluable source of knowledge and advice 
that has been a real comfort to have.

Thanks for reading and thanks for any and all responses,
