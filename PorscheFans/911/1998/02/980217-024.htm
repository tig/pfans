Thanks for the informative reply, Ez!

Well, I have to admit that no wheels I've seen yet have turned my head
like the RUF wheels have.

Would you say they're heavier than the STOCK C2 wheels (mine actually
has the 16" wheels from a '92 C2)?

That's in the plan! ;^)

Actually, I've found someone with a used (9,000 miles) set of "OEM sport
shocks and Euro RS springs" for not a heck of a lot of money. Has anyone
tried this combination? I admit that I haven't looked around too hard, and
this setup is the first thing I found... I know, I know... I haven't done
my homework yet!!! (but the price seems pretty good!)

Ez, thanks for including the note from Nick Andjar - that and your comments
too are valuable! Do you mind my asking what the RUF suspension setup cost?
(I'm cringing already in preparation ;^)

Cheers,

Ross
