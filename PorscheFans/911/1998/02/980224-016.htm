Joe,

That was me (sorry!).

Thanks, my trailex was not made for a 911 but everything
is adjustable so I will call Carl and see what I can do
to make it into a 911 trailer. The cool thing about trailex trailers
is that everything is bolted on, so you can move axles, 
fenders, tie downs, etc... This is my 2nd trailex (both
bought used), neither which was designed for a 911 and 
both towed terribly with the car facing forward (can you
say sway?)...

I just called Carl, he said I have a 944 trailer with
80" from the rear of the trailer to the center of the
2 axles. He said I can move the axles back to 68"
and it will be a 911 trailer. There are 3 bolts on 
either side of each axle to move to different holes.
Also I may have to extend the brake lines.
The Fenders slide back if you loosen the mounting 
bolts.

We also recently had a discussion on pfans on weight distributing
hitches. Carl said NOT to use one with a trailex
(which is what I originally remembered). He said
that due to the adjustability of the axles there is no
need for it as you can configure it for the
optimum tongue weight for any car. Also he said
the steel hitch will be pulling up on the aluminum
trailer tongue and in a fight between steel and
aluminum which do you think will lose? He also
confirmed what I wrote about not using sway control
bars.

I'm glad we had this discussion, it will be a lot better
when I have the trailer setup right! No more cardboard
over the engine to keep out bugs/rain/dirt.

I'm sorry for any misinformation and glad someone
was there for corrections.
