I recently purchased an '89 Carrera Coupe (linen/black) and am thrilled.
A few quick questions...

1) it didn't come with an owners manual. any suggestions on where i can
pick one up? (i'm sure Porsche has it for a small fortune)

2) where is the tag that has the option codes? i always thought it was on
the underside of the hood, but not on this car.

3) having never driven a Porsche before, please set me straight.  the play
in the clutch doesn't seem right... in other words, as i release the
clutch it doesn't actually start to "grab" until almost fully released.
is this right?  (i had the car checked out by a porsche mechanic, but i
was just curious about this)

Thanks!
