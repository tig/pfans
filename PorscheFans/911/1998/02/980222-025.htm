	Tom, Walt,
		Are you sure about this? I just tried literally
	moments ago to take the shifter knob off of my 98 993
	to replace it with a nifty RS shifter but it looks to me 
	like its glued on .... I tried tapping (upwards) around
	the base of the knob trying to dislodge it but to no avail!

	Any advice about removing/installing the knob would be
	greatfully received!

	Rgds

	- Larry
