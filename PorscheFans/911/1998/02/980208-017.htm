Colin,
The C2 Turbo Porsche wheels in 17" are not Fuchs and are specific to the
964 series cars.  They have an offset of 52-55mm versus the 5 spoke
forged Fuchs wheels which are designed for the pre-90 model year cars
and did not come in 17".  Fuchs in 16" have an offset of 10.6-23.3mm
(8"/7")depending on width. One, not only, reason for the offset change
is ABS in the 964 cars forced the wheel hubs outward, so the wheels
needed to be tucked further in to stay in the fenders.  If you're
talking about aftermarket C2T wheels made by Hartmann or Borbet, you can
buy 5 spoke C2T style wheels for your car in 17" but be sure it was cast
with the right offset.  My quess is that you could buy Porsche/Speedline
C2T wheels and by using a 30-40mm spacer and longer studs fit them to
your car, but I'm not fond of those types of solutions.  

Bottom line is yes if they're aftermarket and specified for your year
911.

Good Luck,
Carmen
