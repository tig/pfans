The more you think you know, the more you find out some detail is
missing in your inventory.  Like the shift from ball pop-on rear sway bar
attachments to bolt ons.  All the factory had to do there was to change
the steel part which was cast or inserted into the aluminum banana
casting.  Sounds like they did this as part of the change to the SCs, as
someone reports his '78 had the bolt-on.  Tricky part is, sometimes 
factory maybe made changes before end of model year (ran out of old
parts) or after beginning of new model year (using up old parts).  A
buddy has a '74 S.  The spec for that car is the steel (iron?) A caliper,
not the aluminum S caliper.  But his has the S caliper, and he swears it
had it from the factory and it wasn't an option, etc.

Which means that for some things you may just have to look, I guess,
and you can't entirely go by model year.
