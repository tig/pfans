I have a cordless BEL 945i.  If it does not pick up any activity for an
hour, it will shut off, but it will tell me beforehand.  It tells me when
the batteries are getting low.  (I keep spares in my glove compartment.)  It
picks up highway and local signals.  It senses road work, detours, etc.  It
picks up 3 frequencies.   I am not a reckless driver, but if I were one to
follow ALL the rules, I would have purchased something other than a turbo.

My detector has saved me from getting a ticket quite a few times.  (The
color of my car is not common.  My mufflers make it possible for people to
hear me a long time before they see me.  I am sure the local police have
placed bets as to who will tag me first!)

Since you make a long trip quite often, do you have a cb antennae
PERMANENTLY attached to your car?  Where have you attached it?

You are absolutely right!  Some truck drivers are very nice and helpful.
Others have the filthiest mouths in the world.     100mph in the dark, eh
Chuck?  Tell me this, where on their bodies do the deer, raccoons and
alligators attach their cb antennas?  (I apologize in advance, but I just
COULD NOT pass this one up!)

Everybody is different.  It is whatever works for them.  My detector has
already paid for itself, not only by helping me avoid costly tickets, but
also in the inevitable price increases of insurance premiums....   I keep it
on a visor, not a desk.

Also, something to note:  Before purchasing a detector, check with the
department of motor vehicles in your state, as some states do not allow them
to be used.

My first investment was a good radar detector!
