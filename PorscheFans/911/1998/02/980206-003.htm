Al asks about insurance coverage for his car during Drivers Ed events.
My car is currently covered by 2 companies:
The St. Paul, for Drivers Ed, and general street use coverage (ask an
independent agent for info)  Be advised, however, that The St. Paul also
has all of my other insurance personal/business coverage - which may add
"leverage" for getting coverage for DE.
Conseco (812-424-5576) for Club Racing coverage.
Conseco also covers cars for Drivers Ed events.
Very happy with coverage from each - altho never had to make a claim on
either policy. (Insert all the usual disclaimers.)
Would contact both for quotes and more info.
Hope this helps - teresa
