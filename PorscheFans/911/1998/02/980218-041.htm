Although I haven't tried this combo, I think the largest 16 inch tire you can
fit is a 205/55.  A guy ran this combo at a track event a couple of years ago,
but I believe he had to roll his fender lips to make it work.  Part of the
problem is the roughly 24.8 inch diameter of the 205/55-16.  A 205/60 is
a pretty tight fit (mine needed to have the fender lips rolled to eliminate
a slight rubbing problem) and they are a little smaller in diameter than the
205/55-16s.

IMHO, about the best you can hope for on a '77 is 7x15s all around with
225/50-15s and even this isn't a given - it'll take some fender work.

Good luck,
