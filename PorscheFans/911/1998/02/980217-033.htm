Some observations from my 73 T, 2.4 w/CIS
> 
> Hello everyone,

Same with MFI.

I replaced my door seals and that made a big difference!  Sunroof in mine
so not sure about the targa top.

Not sure what you mean by light...I drove a 1990 C2 and thought it was heavy
and no road feel...I have 205/60 tires all the way around and no complaints...
(*and no body mods*)
>

I have similar experience driving in the city of San Francisco...10-15mpg in the
city, 20-25+(highest was 28mpg) on straight fwy driving.
