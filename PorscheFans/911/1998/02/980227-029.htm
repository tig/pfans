Subject: Squeaky A-arms

Rick and John,
  The front A-arms can make a terrible squeak. A few years ago 
the ones on my '86 were doing this after I replaced the torsion
bars with bigger ones. I had heard that the A-arm bushings
wear out so I replaced them. When I got them old bushings out they 
were like brand new. I replaced them anyway - and the A-arms still 
squeaked. 
  It turned out that the torsion bar cap had worn into the cross member
allowing the torsion bar to rub on the inside of the A-arm "tube". 
When I cleaned the grease off the old torsion bars I could see where
they had been rubbing also (but handn't squeaked).
  To fix, remove the cap, put a little weld on the shiny part (that
rubs the cross member) then file/grind it down so it just fits in the 
cross member. I had a machine shop do the welding part.Someone told 
me they built up the crossmember with weld which is more difficult 
but sounds like the "right way" since that is the part that is 
actually worn. I'm not a welder and the gas tank is right behind
the cross member...
  Except for the welding, the front suspension stuff is really
easy to do yourself if you don't try to remove the A-arm from the
car.
  I replaced the bushings with the Weltmeister "Street Hardness"
flavor and I don't think I even lubed them. Mine don't squeak in 
normal use. The last time I can remember hearing them squeak was 
coming off the track onto a bumpy paddock road. I don't know if 
it was the bumps or the track time that made them squeak.

John Adams please let me know what you find out. I have an 85 Carrera with
a similar problem. It squeaks like the dickens during normal suspension
movement. Not always, it comes and goes.
Someone on this list suggested that it might be a weld problem and that I
could remove the torsion bar and grind down the high spot. When I removed
the t-bar, there was a very clear wear mark on it. I ground it down further
and replaced it. The squeak stopped for about a month and now is back as
bad as ever.

I bought some used A-Arms and t-bars from a wrecked '87 w/ 40K on it to
replace mine, thinking that the rubber bushing must have sagged a bit. When
I finally go the A-arms and T-bars I see that the replacement t-bar is worn
the same as mine, yet the seller said there were never any squeaks.

I think I'm going to try the replacement A-Arms this weekend just for
grins.

Pfans-
I also noticed that Automotion is now selling 'street' hardness replacement
bushings which they claim don't squeal like the 'track' hardness bushing.
Anyone out there have experience with 'em ?
