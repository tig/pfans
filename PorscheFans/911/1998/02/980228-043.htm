Up to you. If you are stretching your budget at this price, it's probably
not a good deal, but if you can get the car for $14-15K, you are around
$5K under market, so you could afford a few things. A local here in
Louisville sold an '83 cab, one owner, with around 40K miles for $21k
last year. I bought my '84 Cab with 32.5K miles (I'm the 4th owner) for
$26K a year ago January.

BTW, I don't know where you live, but there is an immaculate '89 Cab for
sale here in Louisville by a PCA member. It's black with 80K miles, C2
wheels, gray leather interior, but looks NEW. The asking price is $30K.
