While I don't think my car has ever seen a temperature as low as 32 F,
it's not uncommon for me to have the lever slightly raised after a couple
hours of operation.

You don't have the lever up far enough.  All that lever does is engage a
stop on the throttle cable as it runs back to the motor, so it's
effectively able to do most of the heel/toe for you.

Yep.  I tend to use that alternator warning light as a "stall indicator",
and feed in a little gas at that point.

In my experience, simply leaving the lever up a bit should help with most
of these problems.  Then again, my FI pump is far from operating
perfectly so it's possible that a well operating MFI pump can be
convinced not to do such things.
