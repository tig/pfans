Hello P-Fans:

Last October I purchased a '91 964 C2 Coupe in excellent shape.  
Milage is 60K.  All service has been done and the car has a clean 
bill of health.  I want to improve power output and have been 
following Bruce Anderson's guidance on modifying a 964.  One of 
Bruce's notes was that one of the reasons that a 993 put out more 
power than a 964 was the switch to a 3 in to 1 exhaust header in the 
993 as well as intake track changes.  

My question is, will a stock 993 exhaust system bolt on my car 
directly, or would I be better off with an aftermarket unit, such as 
a "BBTriflo".  I want to keep my heat exchangers, as this is a street 
car.  I also recently installed a distributor vent hose from Porsche 
to help cool the distributor belt drive - does anyone have any 
experience with this modification? Did it help.  It was a relatively 
cheap fix (if it works).  As far as any of the recorded problems with 
964's in general, the cylinder/block joints appear dry and the 
clutch/flywheel assembly work just fine.  I can't find anywhere in 
the service history that the flywheel has been changed.  My car was 
made before the factory changed flywheels from the original from '89. 
 Any recommendations on the intake side of the equation?  Any help 
offered would be appreciated.
