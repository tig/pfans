Dan,

I have an 81 as well, and I just put Bilstien's on the rear.  I had =
someone hold the shock from under the car while I turned the nut on top. =
 Be prepared for some cramped arms ;).  The Bilstiens had a 6mm (I =
think) allen slot at the top, so install was a matter of fitting an =
allen wrench and letting the firewall hold it for me while I turned (a =
ratcheting wrench is a BIG help here - check with Sears etc.)

On the front (BTW - I had Boge originals), There was a large "nut" at =
the top of the strut (not in the trunk, but at the wheel well where the =
rod meets the cylinder).  All I had to do was remove the nut and pull =
the insert.  If you are sending them in to fix, You may need to remove =
the wheel and pull the strut off of the A arm - this I am not sure of.  =
Also, I think Bilstien fronts are different than Boge.

Hope this helps...

Chris '81SC
