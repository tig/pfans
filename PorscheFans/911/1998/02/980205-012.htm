Al:

Most agents and insurance companies will tell you that you're not
covered for such things, but that doesn't mean you're not.  Many years
ago, when I was competing in Porsche Owners Club events, a middle
aged woman rolled and destroyed her '84 Carrera Cabriolet in the esses
at Riverside at about 110 mph.  She called her agent (State Farm) and he
told her what yours has told you - "I've told you you're not covered when
you're on the track."  She called me to ask for my assistance (I'm a
lawyer, although my practice is intellectual property).  I called the agent,
called the company, wrote a letter explaining that all activities with her
car were covered other than those that were specifically excluded and
that the company would be sued for bad faith if they didn't pay, and she
had a check for $41,000 within a few weeks.

Now, the language you mention is different than in her policy, which
contained no exclusion at all (those were the days!), but it seems to me
that the insurance company would have a hell of a time proving that you
were preparing for a racing/competition event, if you've never
participated in such an event and testify that you have no intention of
doing so.  I would think "preparation for" means you've got an event that
takes place over a weekend, and you're practicing on Saturday for timed
runs/a race on Sunday.

Now, for the disclaimer (I'm a lawyer - you knew one was coming! :-)). 
While I'm providing you some information on this subject, I'm not rendering
legal advice, since I'm not permitted to do so other than to clients of my
firm.  If you want legal advice on which you can rely, contact an
attorney, and see what he/she says.

Good luck!

P.S. - I put on driver instructional events twice a year at Willow Springs
and Buttonwillow, and have been doing so for the last 6 years.  In all of
those events, I've never had a collision - just cars going off the track and
getting dirty, some rock chips, and occasionally a bent wheel.

Hi P-Fans,

I just got off the phone with my American Family insurance agent
regarding coverage during a driver's ed event.  He stated that I would
not be covered because the policy states that "preparation for or
participation in an organized or prearranged racing or speed
competition" is not covered.  Despite my explanation that driver's ed is
neither racing nor a speed competition, the agent stated that it is
considered "preparation for" and therefore is excluded from coverage.

Those of you out there who participate in driver's ed, do your insurance
companies cover you?  If so, which insurance company?  Do I have any
other option besides switching to a company that is willing to cover me
for driver's ed events?

Thanks in advance.
