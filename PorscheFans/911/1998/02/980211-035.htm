<pre>
after reading Derek and Walker's chat about MFI I thought I might offer my
$.02. The use of the hand lever as described is not normal. This lever is
used for cold starts and once the car warms-up the lever should be able to
be pushed to the floor and the car will idle normally(usually only takes a
couple of minutes). When the MFI is right it is wonderful but if it isn't
there is a whole list of things that need to be checked(as listed by Bill
in another response).

You can get a copy of the factory manual about the Porsche MFI for about
$20 from Pacific Fuel Injection. They are located in San Francisco. The
number is (415)588-8880. The manual is very easy to follow and helps quite
a bit. Hope this helps.

Good luck!
