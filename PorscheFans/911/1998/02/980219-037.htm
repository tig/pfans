Does anyone out there have a pair of sunvisors for my 1973 911? 
I sure need some! 
Mine look like rotted shopping bags. 
I would also like to get a complete Mechanical Fuel Injection setup 
for my 2.7, if no one has a set of Webers to sell. 
I have a complete Air Conditioning setup for a 1973 911 for sale
> - too cold here - this is a dealer installed Behr unit, and is absolutely
>complete - right down to the tiniest nuts, bolts and clips. 
>The under dash controls/vents assembly nicely finishes off the under dash
area which is kind of "busy" otherwise.  I also have the wiring diagram
>and the Behr warranty book. 
>This was dealer-installed before delivery of the car, 
>which was the standard then. 
>This was the only way to get air conditioning in 1973. 
>I also have a 1972 flywheel/pressure plate/throwout brg/disk set 
>(used, the disk has a little life left but the rest is excellent)
>and a complete set of door panels/handles/etc (black) excellent.
>Interested in doing a little horse-trading?
