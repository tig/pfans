Hi there,

My sister owns a company in Florida that makes custom floor-mats for any =
car, any year.  They will embroider Porsche logo or anything you might =
want in there (or nothing at all).  They also make custom seat covers =
with logos as well.  It is the stuff that you normally buy at the =
dealers.

If they don't have the mold for your car, you can make a mold on a =
newspaper and mail it to them.

Her name is Daisy and the number is (305) 828-2959

Luis

>I've been unable to find rear floor mats for a '68 Targa.  I heard =
today
>that the rear mats for a 356 are close enough.  Has anyone tried this?
