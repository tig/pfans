     Hi all,
     
     If when you hit the start switch, you hear a 'whine', but engine 
     doesn't turn over, you've got a bad starter solenoid.  The solenoid 
     pushes the gear on the starter toward the ring-gear on the flywheel 
     and engages the rotating motion of the starter with the engine.  This 
     solenoid can get really dirty (it lives in the same place with all the 
     crud from your clutch).  This "dirt" is really abrasive and wears on 
     the moving parts on the solenoid and it finally gets stuck.  The motor 
     on your starter however isn't necessarily worn requiring a complete 
     rebuild.  You can buy a new BOSCH solenoid from any starter/alternator 
     rebuild house for $40 to $60...any more and they are ripping you off.  
     What is funny, or not so funny depending on how you see it, Bosch 
     starter parts cost pretty much the same, no matter what car (or 
     motorcycle) they go on.
     
     A complete rebuild on my extremely high torque Mercedes 240Diesel 
     starter was $140 (1 year warrantee, diesels are really hard on 
     starters).  The same rebuild for my oversized (for a motorcycle) 
     starter for my Moto Guzzi was guess again.....$140!!!  While pricing 
     like this is something that goes with the territory for German and 
     Italian autos/motorcycles, it is really annoying when a completely 
     rebuilt starter for most any American car is $40!!!!   With same 
     warrantee!!!!
     
     One word of caution, if you have high mileage on your starter, (over 
     100K) you might as well get the whole thing rebuilt which includes a 
     new solenoid.  
     
     
     Good Luck
