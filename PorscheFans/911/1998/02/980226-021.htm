In response to some questions posted regarding the performance
gains using K&N filters, I'd have to say I am skeptical if there would
be any gain without additional modifications. To obtain the gains
these guys advertise, you'd probably have to change more than
a filter. e.g. chip, air box, etc... This opinion is based on what I
measured.

Since there appears to be many myths and a total lack of any real
data, I decided to do a base line (dyno) with my 1986 911 Carrera, 
stock engine, air box, headers and muffler.

I went to HMS Motorsport in Marblehead, MA to conduct the test
on their chassis dyno. A Dynojet 248C Chassis Dynamometer.
The measured results are translated to standard SAE to compensate
for absolute barometric pressure, vapor pressure and intake air
temperature.

Three test were performed, each test had 2-3 runs to ensure consistency.
The first test with NO AIR FILTER, the second with a STOCK PAPER 
FILTER NO COVER, and the third test with the STOCK FILTER & COVER. 

Without going into the exact numbers, (since I did have to pay for
for this information,) the results showed both the HP and TORQUE
with NO AIR FILTER performing the worst of the three test. On
average, it was down by 4 HP and 5 ft-lbs of torque. The differences
between the test with a COVER and NO COVER showed minimal
differences.

It was interesting to me that I lost HP and Torque with no air filter,
which indicates that maybe the chip would have to be changed to
compensate for the air/fuel mixture to get a real benefit. Possibly
changing the headers and muffler for less restriction might help
as well.

I wanted to try a K&N filter, but could not get one in time for the
test. However, one would have to ask that in light of these results,
how a K&N air filter could possibly get me 8 more HP? It couldn't
provide more air to the engine than no fitler.

I'll be changing my headers and muffler to a B&B. Now that I
have a base line with stock, we'll see how much it really gets me. 
The plan is to perform the same base lines and if there is a significant

change, I may try a K&N to see if it does anything.

But in the mean time, ff anyone is interested, I have a K&N Cone filter 
for a 911 which was used a short period of time, produces 8+HP. 
$50 plus shipping and it's yours! This is less than a $1 per HP!!
