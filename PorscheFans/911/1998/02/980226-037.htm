Tom,

Some of the very early synthetic oils available for automobiles were
apparently of a formula that could attack certain types of seals, and lead
to leaks. This is not the case with presently available Mobil 1, Amsoil, and
probably most all the others.

Even without seal damage/shrinkage you may see more oil loss with synthetic
oils, because they generally flow better when cold than regular motor oils,
and a small leak may become more apparent while the car sits in the garage.
Certainly any leak is more expensive with synthetic oils!

I would suggest going ahead and trying something like Mobil 1. No permanent
damage will ensue, and if it seems to be leaking too much, go back to the
cheap stuff.
