Bob, in  theory you are right about the M/S being a smooth bore, but keep in 
mind that for a few million strokes it moves only a part of an inch, so this 
is the only area that stays TRULY smooth.  The rest is rough BY COMPARISON,
and you have the case of the seal passing over its normal smooth operating
bore onto a rougher unused part of the bore.  I have looked inside a used M/C
and you can definitely see area over which the piston normally moves.

 I'm not sure what you mean by this.  You can't force the piston past
 anything that will cause seal damage.  First of all, there's nothing in the
 bore for them to wear against, except the bore itself, and second, there
 are stops in the m/c that prevent the seals from even going over the holes
 in the bores where brake fluid is admitted or expelled.  Am I missing
 something?
