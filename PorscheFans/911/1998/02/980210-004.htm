G'day Guys(not gender specific),


I recently enquired with a few shops here in Australia in regards to a
major service for 1979 930 it has approx. 60k miles. I was given figures
of $700 and $1000(on two occasions). The $700 quote included having the
the motor removed to do the service as the mechanic quoted that you can
not get to the left bank of valves for adjustment and to tighten the
heads, yet the $1000 quotes said this was not required. All of these
shops said that they 
1. changed the oil filter and oil
2. changed the gearbox oil
3. changed the brake fluid
4. changed the petrol filter
5. re-tensioned the heads 
6. adjusted the valves.
7. checked belts etc.

A couple of questions

1. I was wondering is it possible to adjust the valves and re-tension
the heads without dropping the motor ?
2. What else is required in a major service for this vehicle.

Thanks in advance
