Hi Al,
   Congrats, you have bought a rewarding car.  The distributor vent 
you mentioned is to flush out the ozone which was attacking the 
rubber drive belt.  When the belt breaks, the second distributor just 
sits there and fires in one position untill it either burns a hole in 
the cylinder or the driver realizes something is wrong or both.
   My flywheel let loose at 48,000 miles.  My car spends alot of time 
on the track and may or may not be typical.  My advice is not to 
worry about it.
   I have had no problem with cylinder leakage.
   As for exhaust, I think you are about to hear from Joe...  I use a 
RUF rear muffler replacement tube with the cat and the secondary 
muffler.  I also have a secondary muffler bypass that I sometimes 
bolt on at the track when I just want to be loud.  Beware of all the 
hype out there and remember that a certain amount of backpressure is 
important in these engines.
   The best advice I can give you is to remember that these cars are 
well thought out to begin with.  Think of everything you do as part 
of a system.  You can't just change one part of a system.

Good Luck,
Dodge   
.
