Sorry to repeat myself, but I just HAVE to add my opinion...

I have one of the CM Escort radar detectors - the one with
the DSP logic inside - this is the best radar detector I have ever
owned, and it almost never false alarms, but I don't use it anymore;
it's sitting right here in my desk drawer...because...

YOU GUYS HAVE TO GET CB RADIO'S IN YOUR CARS!!!

I make the drive from Gainesville (Florida) to Atlanta (Georgia, duh)
every two weeks - talking to the truckers going the opposite 
direction will provide you with info on every *bear* on the road,
especially the ones *in the middle*, *shooting at you* (radar).

My speed is only limited by my concern for safe driving - I never pass
cars at more than 5MPH or so faster, and I don't feel comfortable at
much over 100MPH in the dark - wildlife, debris in the road, etc make
that too much of a gamble for me...

But I can drive 20-30MPH over the limit, and feel much more secure 
knowing where the bear's are ahead of time, rather than waiting for 
my detector to tell me than I'm on top of them!

By the way, you can still listen to CD's - just turn the CB gain down, and 
you will only hear the trucks that are near you - once in a while, speak
up, and tell the northbound (or whatever is opposite) traffic about the 
road behind you - they will return with info they have... 

Sorry this was so long, didn't mean to preach!  :-)
