Hmmm.  I find that my '71 911T always starts very easily (three 
pumps on the throttle and it starts!) and isn't too finiky.  However, 
for it to be this way everything needs to be in perfect tune.  

The Zenith carburetors are excellent carburetors.  I rebuilt both of 
mine a couple of years ago and it made a remarkable improvment.  
Make sure that all of the accellerator pumps and the over-run system 
is working .  It is very important to have them balanced properly.  
It is a lengthy process that is clearly detailed in the  factory 
workshop manual.

There is a bit of a lean surge at about 3000 rpm.  I believe this is 
due to the idle fuel mixture jets being a little undersized for smog 
purposes.

Make sure that the ignition system is working perfectly, and that the 
valves are in proper adjustment

My 911T isn't quite as smooth as my '72 BMW 2002, but it is pretty 
close.

Even after I had my transmission rebuilt, it was still very stiff and 
particularly difficult to engage into first gear.  The Porsche 
synchronizing system of that era left much to be desired.

If you replace the seals, it will quiet down considerably, but it 
will never be as quiet as a coupe.  I notice the wind leaks around 
the leading edges of the doors more than I do from the top.  There is 
a factory technical bulletin that explains all the intricacies of 
adjusting the top.  It is quiet helpful.

Yes.  With the installation of turbo tie rod ends the car becomes "go 
cart" like.

I can't help you here.

> 4) It gets an optimistic 15 mpg in a mix of fast street and freeway driving.

When I drive at 70 miles per hour on a road trip, I can typically go 
300 miles before filling up with 15 gallons of gasoline.  20 miles 
per gallon is typical.

The mixture is fairly rich with the Zenity carburetors.

> The "seller" is adamant that the Zeniths are in perfect adjustment.

I'd check them myself anyway.  It's fun to get them properly 
balanced.  :)
