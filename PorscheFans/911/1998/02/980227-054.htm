I think I now know why my C4 was running down the battery this winter. It 
turns out to be an interesting diagnostic story.

With the cold weather in Chicago my battery was getting drained, over the 
course of one or two nights of non-driving. Loyal readers of the list may 
recall there was a lot of cross chat among the 964 crowd suspecting a 
problem with the small fans embedded in the HVAC control unit seeming to 
run on and on after the ignition key was removed. I wound up replacing my 
control unit twice trying to get it to stop. I think someone posted a 
comment that the run-on condition seemed to be related to a lower outside 
temperature. In any case, I certainly only noticed it when the weather got 
cold. We then discovered that the Porsche spec for the units allows the fan 
to continue to run for as much as 20 minutes.

But I had another problem in the winter that I never mentioned. When the 
cold weather would come my interior (dome) lights wouldn't light up when I 
opened the doors. I could fiddle with the switch on the door jamb and pull 
the plunger out and get the lights to come on. But sometimes they just 
wouldn't come on. I suspected a bit of corrosion on what is a very simple 
spring loaded switch. It was probably a combination of the rubber cover 
becoming stiff when cold and an aging spring that couldn't quite force the 
plunger to close the switch. I just lived with it during the cold weather. 
Eccentric hand-built cars and all that.

So, picture this. Cold weather. I drive into my garage and park the car. 
Remove the key. Open the door. No lights. Exit muttering. Come back a day 
or three later to a dead battery.

The problem, you see, is that Porsche in their infinite wisdom provided a 
convenience feature on the 964. They decreed that with the key removed you 
should still be able to activate the windows and sunroof until you get out 
of the car. Allows you to close the windows if you forgot. Or to crank the 
roof a crack to let the heat escape while parked. And there is a circuit 
that is energized -- *until you leave*. And how, you ask, does your car 
know when you've left? Easy! When the dome lights come on. Then this 
convenience circuit is de-energized.

Since the door switches never tripped the dome lights this circuit was 
staying energized until my battery was drained. The fix was to replace the 
switches and rubber covers.

So, I was told a story about how the Factory had some 964 derived race cars 
that they stripped for weight savings. But the batteries would all die. 
They could measure a drain on the battery but if they put the key in and 
cycled it the drain would disappear. Well, as you can now all predict, they 
had deleted the door switches, but left the relay and circuit. Ooops.

Kudos to Matt and Ian at Midwest Eurosport for finding this one.
