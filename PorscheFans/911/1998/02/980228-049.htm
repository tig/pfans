Hello PFans:

Wanted to ad my 2 cents worth on the K&N filter debate.  I use a K&N 
filter on my motorcycle, and noticed a "slight" improvement in 
performance. Noticeable, but nothing significant.  Published dyno 
tests on my bike of stock vs K&N filter, 1 to 2 hp pickup.  In a 700 
lb bike you can feel it.  But, I was looking for a HP pick up.  This 
was by design.

On my Porsche ('91 911 C2), I think I would also see a "slight" 
increase in HP.  But, what is the risk?  With the bike, the HP gain 
was from increased air flow.  The same for the Porsche.  It stands to 
reason that if air can flow through the K&N filter easier so might 
particles of dirt.  The cost of rebuilding my 2 cylinder motorcycle 
may be expensive, but relatively inexpensive compared to rebuilding 
my 911.  My feeling has always been that the Porsche factory did 
their homework pretty well when they build my car.  I'm going to 
trust them on their selection of air filters too.  The few ponies 
that I would pick up with a "free flow" (K&N or any other brand) air 
filter, versus the risk of damage, no mater how minute/slow, is not 
worth the trade for me. For those who need or want to obtain the 
extra power, and are making an informed decision, a K&N will flow air 
as advertised.
