Andy -

I believe those are a frequent source of minor vacuum leaks... they were
on my car for sure.  If you unscrew the feed pipe from the injector, you
can then use a flat-blade stubby screwdriver to lever the injector out
of the aluminum intake runner (a *few* drops of soapy water around the
seal will help it pop out).  Once it's out you'll see a fat little
o-ring on the injector (or once in awhile, still left in the intake
runner) that is the actual seal.  These harden and shrink with age, and
are easy and cheap to replace at your local knowledeable Bosch outlet. 
OTOH your injectors wear and gum up with age too; in fact when you pull
them out you'll get a major report card on the detergent qualities of
the fuel you've been using.  At 95k and 17 years I would say that
consensus opinion is that yours are worth replacing if you have 'em out
anyway; a set should be under $200 and you'll probably notice some
improvement in low speed/light throttle driveability due to improved
fuel atomization.

On my car the new o-rings still didn't seal as well as I thought they
should; I kept having vacuum leaks that caused stumbling after
startup... so I added a little pool of self-leveling RTV silicone on top
of each o-ring, around the base of the injector.  The cold/warm start
system now works as designed (i.e. rather well, despite it's Rube
Goldberg appearance) and the overall temper of the engine is modestly
improved.

hope this helps,
