Overall, I think your problem is the Zeniths.  They need to be in top shape
for good driveability.  My Zeniths were pretty much toast and constantly
required fiddling with the hand throttle to make the idle reasonable.
This gets old pretty fast.  Especially if you also have to reposition
the heater lever constantly. (early 911 climate control involves the
constant process of cracking open/closing a  window, changing fan speeds and
moving the heater lever up and down depending on road speed and conditions :)

This activity can be highly entertaining/perplexing to novice passengers who
wonder what you are doing with your hand between the seats all the time.

No, this is not a fly-by-wire car.  OTOH, compared to other sports
cars of the era (Alfa, Fiat, MG, etc.) a 911T is a marvel of refinement.

Fix the Zeniths or better yet get Webers and I think the whole proposition
will change.

Maybe I am a glutton for punishment, but I loved the 901 gearbox and it's
unusual shift pattern.  It was a lot smoother than my factory short shift 915.
