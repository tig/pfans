If they're new, why replace them?

As I said last time you asked, these aren't the best thing for a street
car.  Not a good idea. It's not only the needed frequency of adjustment...
like after every race...but how are you going to know they're adjusted
correctly?  How will you know they're not too tight, causing excessive wear
to the timing chain components.  Or too loose, also causing wear and
risking a catastrophic timing jump.

>I was thinking about the rebuild kit for the originals.

It's a pretty straightforward thing to rebuild them, and you wind up with
what amounts to a brand new tensioner.  In the process, you also learn a
little about how they work, and you learn a lot about how to insert
internal snap rings an inch down in the tensioner housing while
simultaneously keeping the tensioner piston depressed against spring
pressure.  You'll understand when you do it...
