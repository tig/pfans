Hi, Pfans,

  Up from the land of lurk with a small problem.  Until this fall, my  '82
911SC had never leaked oil in its life.  However, I started to have a
persistent leak that I eventually traced to the oil return tubes.
Therefore,  just before storing the car for the winter, I had collapsible
oil return tubes installed by a local, generic wrench.  He showed them to
me before installation, and they appeared to my untrained eye to be the
right thing.  They were cadmium-gold plated with green O-rings.

    However, the car is leaking badly now.  It apears to be from the JOINT
of the two halves of the collapsible tube.  Closer inspection seems to
indicate that the tube may not even be the right part:  The snap-ring (on
the smaller OD tube) that should hold the two halves apart is located about
4 mm from the edge of the larger OD tube -- i.e., it is not doing anything!
Thus, it seems that these may have been designed for use in a car with a
smaller head-to-case distance.

  My questions are: Does anyone know if there are different sizes of
collapsible oil return tubes for 911's?  Does anyone have a positive
experience with collapsible tubes?  Do you know brand and/or supplier?

Many thanks,
Paul Lyman       plyman@nwu.edu
