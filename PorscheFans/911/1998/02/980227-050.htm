Hi Brad,

I have a '66 911 with a sport muffler (2 pipes straight out the back) and I
noticed a definite increase in the performance.  Various materials I have
read have put the differance at 10-15 horsepower.  I think your car might
have had an exhaust restrictor put in to lower the horsepower (to
differentiate it further from the other models) but I might be an Porsche
"urban legend" victim on the restrictor issue.  The sport muffler is
certainly louder.  If you leave for work early you might have some irate
neighbors. I would guess 20% to 30% louder.
