Shawn,

Static timing needs to be considered here.  With the piston at TDC the
spark advance will take place a few degrees *before* TDC.  If the rotor
is only a few degrees ahead of the Z1 mark then you are probably OK.  

If the rotor is 180 degrees from where you want to be then you are on
the the wrong cycle of cylinder 1.  The 4 cycle engine takes 720 degrees
to complete all four cycles (two complete revolutions) . My old shop
teacher fondly called them "suck, squeeze, bang, and blow" (intake,
compression, ignition, exhaust) Z1 happens at the TDC of the compression
stroke (bang) so that both valves are closed (both of the rocker arms
should be loose).  The distributor rotates at 1/2 the speed of the
crankshaft.  So if you are a 180 degrees off (at the distributor) of
whatever the plug 1 position is then the exhaust rocker will be tight
(probably the intake as well, due to overlap).

That was a long-winded way of asking are both the intake and exhaust
rockers loose at Z1?  It is quite possible to mis-align the distributor
upon installation after rebuild.  There should be some good advice out
there on how to align it to its stock position (I don't think I will
try).
