Greetings,

Yesterday while replacing some rear brake pads I noticed that the dust boots
on the axle shafts had no clips on them ('84 Targa 117k). This is the case on
both the output flange and outboard ends. This concerns me because I drive
this car every day and I question the integrity of the CV joints. I can't
believe that there were no clips originally and that this is either age or a
poor repair job by some P.O.

Can someone who has done this repair advise me on this? What are the thoughts
on rebuilt units such as Automotion sells? How difficult is it to drive the
axle out of the bearing once the cotter pin and castellated nut have been
removed-easy or sledge hammer time? Thanks in advance for any of your thoughts
or advice.
