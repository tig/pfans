Ray Calvo is track preparing a 1995 993 3.6L and asked about some of the
above.

	993 spark plugs are not hard to change just takes a little patience is
needed. Buy the plugs at the dealer they have 3 electrodes- so splitfires
and alternatives are not neccessary. On a stock car remove and get rid of,
if you have not already done so 993TT also) the rear engine undercar cover-
worthless and has the potential to keep unneccessary heat in engine and
valve guides...
	Remove both stock rear mufflers and /or aftermarket exhaust system- if you
have the FABSPEED Motorsport 993 system you can change the lower plugs 
WITHOUT taking the system off SAVING 1-1.5hours additional R&R time. Lastly
the top right plug is a true pain in the ass as it is under the power
steering pump.

	Race harness belts 993 and 964s. There is a perfectly safe alternative to
drill a hole through the bottom of the car and carpet to install the 5 -
6th point for antisubmarine belt. On the front seat platform that are
welded to the floor chassis of the car are 2 triangular brackets on each
front seat. You drill a hole and slip in a AN bolt with 2 washers and a
locking nut in 1 side for a 5 point or both sides for 6 point. Also on the
transmission tunnel there should be a threaded BOSS that will accept a 7/16
bolt or you can have a shop weld a nut to a washer and weld this to a
fairly large factory made (air spce) captive hole under the rear carpet
area right near the floor pan.

	Since you are going to be driving  your 1995 993 and are looking for
reliable and safe performance. I have a suggestion to really wake up the
cars engine performance with a couple simple proven bolt-ons! I manufacture
the finest t304 dual usuage exhaust system for all 993s. Its called the
SUPERCUP and is a virtual duplicate of the factory system but has 3.5"
outlets that have slip in slip/out SS muffler baffles.  It is slightly
louder than the motor sound package which is too mild- and very strong with
the baffles out. Sounds beautiful like a rear Supercup car. You have a
choice of Arnold Scwarzenegger in an Armani suit and the Terminator. You
can virtually drive around other 993s with factory and/or competitors
systems on the street or track. My systems as a point of reference RULED
1997 E and D stock in PCA club racing with the baffles removed. 

	In addition, I have a dynotested matching proprietary chip for the 1995
993 that with the exhaust and proprietary aircleaner assembly bumps the
1995 +29hp +/-2 to just over 300HP. The chip is not used in PCA club
racing. Stage 3, which is very loud but extremely effective but not legal
for US highways, adds a catalytic converter bypass to the system. 
	This system is so effective it is wonderfull. Its like having a hot new
Canadian stripper for girlfriend!  It makes you laugh!  I debutted this
stage 2 system on two 1995 993 cars at the POCONO Club race 1997. In a
field of approximately 55 cars the two FABSPEED MOTORSPORT 1995 993s with
the (SUPERCUP system baffles out and CAT bypass only  (993s that were
extensively scrutinzed with DME boxes personally sealed by HARRY HALL PCA
Club racing technical rules enforcer) came up on and drove litterally over
the roof of B&B TRIFLOW equiped 1995 993 that had an Autothority chip- and
the rest of the entire field. Cars in the field also included 1997 993s
with B & B triflows and stock mufflers! The two FABSPEED cars qualified 1
and 2 on the poll- covering the front row. Competitors were so upset,
especially the B&B chipped 993 that were showing in car video and mailing
incar videos to the scrutineers. I had great video as well of the 2 993s
blowing the doors off the chipped 993 and  a guy from Boston named Ronald.
I had no fucking sympathy however as I had offered these B&B owners
discounts numerous times. One of these B&B cars had even suffered several
muffler failures as the muffler cases split. One time his B&B muffler split
was catastrophic and lead to an engine fire.You can lead a horse to water
but you can make it drink. The FABSPEED 993 continued win every race
entered for the remainder of 1997. I also have 6 993's in D stock, 993TT in
C, and C4  in E at Sebring 1998 48hours.

	If you need a vesatile t304 dual use lightweight 993 system that is
continually refined and redynoed, street/touring, and track tested on a
continual and recurring basis the best is available Fabspeed Motorsport. I
also have a comlete line
of DME chips for stock but more importantly various modified engine
combinations that work. Nobody offers this service and selection. Systems
in stock always!
