Dear P-fans,

As I was born one month before Porsche launched the 911, having one of
my own, is a life long dream. Finally I can afford to buy one, albeit it
second hand.

Based on the advise found on this list and in the recommended reading
often cited here, I'm aiming for a 88 or 89 Carrera : the best my money
will buy.

I'm not into DIY at this level of complexity nor do I want to be too
distracted from enjoying my new purchase by little (or big) day to day
annoyances of less than well maintained cars.

This weekend, I ran into what looks to be a promissing candidate to
fulfill my dream. A night blue 88 Carrera, sports seats, blue leather
interior, sunroof, no tail (that's what I want), 16" Fuchs (rear 9"
turbo). The car has 133 000 kilometers (ca. 83 000 miles), and a full
service history. Asking price is 790 000 BEF (ca. 21 000 USD). Seller is
an independant Porsche shop with a good reputation and they offer a 3
month warranty.

What is holding me back from paying for it and driving it home :

1) it does not have A/C. OK, I live in Belgium, this is not California
or Florida, but even a little sun in spring will heat up a car's
interior to an uncomfortable level. As my 911 will be my third car,
and thus good weather only, I'd like to find out through this list how
badly you need A/C in a 911. And what the disadvantages are of having
one
(does it work properly ? does it need lots of maintenance ? how well
does
it age  ? (as I am considering cars that are 10 years old)).

2) it does have a sun roof. Good for ventilation, but I remember reading
about leakages. This sun roof is 10 years old, what about the chance of
it leaking ? How noisy is a 911 sunroof anyway ? (I've driven several
cars
that had quiet sunroofs, others were real nuisances due to excessive
noise levels or sounds)

3) it has 9" wide turbo rims at the rear. Great looks, but they do get
very
close to the bodywork. And I suppose the 245 tire size does get a little
more expensive than the 8" 225 sizes commonly used on this model. And
what about the car's balance, handling ? How is it affected by the use
of wider wheels and tires at the rear (front are "classic" 7x16 205's).

4) the previous owner lowered the car to the extreme. Again great looks,
but am I not better off raising it back to it's normal ride height ?

All your good advice is more than welcome. I let one very good 89
Carrera go end of last year for lack of good advice. I do not want to
make the same mistake again.
