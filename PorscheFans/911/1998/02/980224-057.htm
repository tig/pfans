Hi Mike. Congratulations!

Automotion sells the owners manual for about $30 (http://automotion.com).

That's where it is supposed to be.  I have one on my 86, however it only lists
1 option code (car has just about every option).  I guess these stickers were
applied by the dealers and not the factory so some dealers did and some
didn't.

I don't have the details, but I seem to recall reading here that you can write
the PCNA and get the options or what it came with out of the factory.

My clutch doesn't grab, but this is also my first Porsche (and not the
original clutch).
