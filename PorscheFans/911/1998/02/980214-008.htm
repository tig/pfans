Lyle,

The part you refer to seems to be the cover for the heater lever
light.  On my '77S, this is directly behind the edge of the
console, and directly in front of the two defrost levers, to
the right of the handbrake lever.  This should indicate the
on/off status of the rear heater blower (mounted on the engine)
which is distinct from the fresh air blower controlled by
the levers on the main instrument panel.

If I am right, this piece is available from Automotion (800.777.8881)
for about $15 plus $1.00 for the bulb (see current catalog, #16, pg 66;
part #914.632.107.00).
BTW, don't worry about appearing dumb; I am surely dumb enough regarding
Porsches for both of us!

HTH,

Robert Herbert
