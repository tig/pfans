There is room for debate here. The factory certainly change the fuel
requirement from regular unleaded to premium unleaded. The programming on
the chip was changed to take advantage of this. Nothing in the engine
changed at all. This is the factory line on the change in HP. 

I believe Jerry Woods and Bruce Anderson have done some dyno tests that
suggest that there is not noticeable difference bewteen an '87 or later
brain box and an '86 or ealier one.

Will we ever know the truth? Does it really matter? What's 10 HP amongst
friends?

The compression ratio of the US engine is 9.3 to 1. The Europan engine is
10.3 to 1. That, along with a different chip and exhaust make up the HP
difference.
