Brian queries the list:

"I am having some trouble trying to figure out how to remove the retaining
pins on the rear calipers.  According to Haynes there is a retaining clip,
however mine does not have any.  Do you just drive the pins out?"  

My '77 had retaining clips on the M caliper pins in the rear, and drive
in-out pins on the A calipers in the front.  Probably as a result of different
replacement kits somewhere back in its history.  The drive-in kind have a
split circular compression band around the (inside) flanged end of the
retaining pin.

I don't know which I like best.  With the drive kind you don't have to line
up the retaining clip hole and fiddle around putting it in.  On the other hand
you have to reach back there with something (little plastic hammer is
perhaps the "mechanic-like" thing to use) to drive them in, and use a
skinny punch to drive them out.   On balance if NASCAR pitstop speeds
were needed the drive-in should have a slight edge.  

Both seem to do the job equally well and have since I got my car in '84,
never broke or fell out, so I have never particularly minded the
difference.

So take your punch (or some substitute - a nail, for instance - you only
have to drive it 1/4 inch or so before it is loose) and have at it.
