Denny,

I use an assortment of alligator clip wires.  I run several tests with the
O2 sensor disconnected from the fuel injection (open loop, meter in series)
and then several tests with both the multimeter and O2 sensor connected to
the FI system (closed loop, meter in parallel).  The second test requires
use of two alligator test lead, one to the FI, one to the multimeter.

In the first case (open loop; meter in series), you can watch the baseline
operation of the FI.  I use this to set the idle mixture is also how I
learned that in general my mixture is lean.  In the second test (closed
loop; meter in parallel) want to ensure that the FI can adjust the mixture
correctly using the input from the O2 sensor.  You want to ensure that the
FI can compensate for any lean or rich running conditions.

Recently someone described that their '85 was "surging" under light
throttle.  I also find this annoying, but attribute it to my lean mixture
problem.  I am comforted to feel the "surge" knowing that the FI is
enrichening the mixture properly to fix the lean running.  One day I'll
replace the seals on my intake manifold and injectors.  Hopefully this will
fix the problem.  If not, I double check everything in the FI system and
then play with the spring tension on my airflow sensor.
