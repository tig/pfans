 I recently replaced the shift rod coupler bushings on my 86 Carrera.   One
side had disintegrated.  The pin is held in place by an interference fit in
the bore of the threaded piece through which the pin passes. The interference
is formed by the metal displaced on either side of a  longitudinal "split" at
the center of the pin.  The "split" looks like it is formed by a blow from a
hammer and chisel.  The pin is easily removed from the coupler assembly.
There is enough flat surface below the hole in the threaded piece to clamp the
assembly in a vise.  Do not clamp the alloy housing of the coupler, only the
flat surface of the threaded piece below the hole.  A couple of sharp raps
with a hammer and drift or punch (I used an old valve) on the end of the pin
will force it out of the threaded piece and housing allowing removal of the
bushings (if they have not already removed themselves).  Installation is the
reverse.  I recommend that you reinforce the "split" in the pin with a chisel
before installing it to retain the fit.   One additional recommendation
provided by my parts supplier is to ensure that the threaded piece moves
freely between the bushings even if one has to file away the sides of the
bushings a small amount.  Supposely, if the coupling does not move freely, a
hard road shock may be transmitted through the stiff coupling causing the
transmission to jump out of gear.  You can check the fit before installing the
pin.  Good luck.
