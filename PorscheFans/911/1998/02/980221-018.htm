Hi Andy,

It sounds like you speak from experience.  That's the kind of 
experience that nobody wants.  To answer your question, yes, Purple K 
and most other dry powders are corrosive.  They are very mild 
corrosives by themselves, but when you put them on a hot material the 
corrosive action is accelerated.  Dry powders do not cool the fire, 
they put it out chemically.  So the powder gets plenty of time to bake 
on.
Take Care,
Ken
