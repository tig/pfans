The Prosche Sportomatic Saga conclusion.  
You may recall my original story: a Sportomatic that would not shift out of
gear in idle but worked well at 1,100 and up if I downshifted before coming to
a stop.  Coupled with this was the lack of braking power.  Seeing as the
brakes are also vacumn assited it meant to me that there was a vacumn problem.

The first try at fixing the problem was to order a new vacumn switch from
Germany.  After a rather long delay it was installed only to not work
correctly.  Then they instrumented to vaccumn line and checked for leaks
during braking.  Though the Vacumn dropped from about 16mb to 11, there were
no leakes – that is changes from the 11mb.  

The next search involved looking for the reason for low vacumn.  The first
source was a bad intake leak on #6.  The gasket was repalced and wala More
Vacumn.  Then they found that #5 was flooding.  After verifying that the
injectors were OK by swapping, the diagnostics lead to the fuel distributor.
After this was repalced it started to shift reliably.  

But just when I was to pick up the car they found the idle would stick at
2,500 rpm in neutral.  Turned out to be a sticking mechanical advance in the
distributor.  PO had tried twice to fix this intermittent problem.  

Car ready to pick up.  Yes?  No!  The morning of delivery they found that it
still would not release the clutch when the enjine was cold.  

This lead to two weeks or more of starting the car on the lift each morning to
try and catch it in the act.  As luck would have it, it refused to fail.  New
brains were put to the task and he found the auxiliary air regulator had a
broken wire.  The fuel pressure was way too high and the warm up regulator had
to be readjusted.  

Suddenly it worked reliably.  After several days of cold starting and hot
running, it worked every time.  

By the way, an old wrench remembered that the early Sportomatics had an
intermittent problem that was solved by drilling holes in the clutch rivets.
It seems that due to high temperature combined with the little recessed
pockets for the rivets acted as suction cups.  

I picked the car up and the shifting has been flawless.  The dealer also
forgave a lot of hours in the diagnosis time and did not charge for the new
vacumn valve that was not needed.  

Over all I’m happy with the dealer as they also fixed a lot of other things
while they had the car.  

The brakes were bled and the fluid checked – all OK.  
The windshield washer motor was remounted and back flushed.  It works now.  
The rear window defogger was checked and found to be now parcially working.  
A used wipper switch (mine) was installed.  They don’t activate when I go over
a bump now.  
Two oil leakes were found and fixed.  

And by the way, the brakes now work great also.  

77-911S  Targa, Sportomatic, gold/blk 90,300 mi
92 Plymouth Grand Voyager 3.3 67,000 mi
90 Dodge Spirit ES 3.0 65,000 mi, K&N air filter – fast, it does make a
measurable difference.
