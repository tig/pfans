As I have mentioned recently, my '77 911 is in the body shop getting all
pretty again.  When I went by yesterday form my visit, I was shown my
recently removed front fenders, and it is clear to even these untrained
eyes, that the best course of action is to replace them.

But OEM fenders are $1000 each!!!  I plan to keep the car for at least 10
years - but $2K seems alot for 2 fenders.

Last night I quickly went through my catelogs and the only place I found
selling aftermaket fenders was Tweeks at about $325 each.  Has anyone have
any experience with these fenders, or know how long they will last, their
weaknesses???

According to the catelogs the same front fender is used from '74 to '89.
Does anyone know a good place for rust free used fenders from the late
'80's?

Any opinions on the carbon fiber ones??

Given that the car is essentially a daily driver, does anyone have any
other suggestions??

Thanks

John
