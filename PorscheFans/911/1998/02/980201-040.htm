Hello P-Fans

My brake warning light is on all the time the ignition is on and has
been for about 10 days now.  It's not the handbrake light, it's the one
directly underneath it.  According to the Owner's Manual, either the
handbrake or the footbrake has failed. In my case both work fine.

I took the car in this morning to the local Porsche dealer for a few
things, two of which were a registration inspection (runs out tomorrow)
and the brake warning light.  The brake pads are only half-way worn
(good news!) and the handbrake pulls the car up at low speed no probs
and holds it still on inclines.  The car was awarded a pass for the
registration inspection and therefore, the mechanic thinks the brakes
are safe.  The car does respond "normally" to the use of the brake
pedal.  There are no smells either - (e.g. burning rubber or similar).

The mechanic checked the whole brake system and looked for broken wires
and seals all over and couldn't find what is wrong.  He couldn't find
any sensors either that might measure how worn the pads are, etc.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks In Advance
