I have lurked through several discussions on this list concerning refinishing
of Fuchs wheels, and am now engaged in this task myself.  I obtained a
straight but cosmetically rough set of 6Jx15 wheels and had the anodizing
stripped and the wheel faces polished.  They look so beautiful (and slightly
unusual) without the black web centers that I am not going to repaint them. Is
it absolutely necessary to re-anodize them?  

The previous discussions I have read here indicated that it is, but the wheel
shop doing the polishing says no, they'll stand up fine to corrosion by just
using an aluminum polish/protectant on them regularly. Has anyone had
experience with this? We don't have salted roads here in San Diego, but we do
have salty ocean breezes.  Am I risking pitting and corrosion in the future?

Thanks in advance for any input.
