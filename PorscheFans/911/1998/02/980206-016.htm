Here's how Allan Caldwell describes it in the February '98 PNWR Spiel:

After raising the front of the car and removing the front wheels, the 
grease caps on the wheel hubs are removed to gain access to the hub nuts. 
Getting the grease caps off some of the mid range 911s ('75-'85 time 
period) is probably the hardest part of the job since a press fit steel 
cap is used to fit inside the alloy hub edges. The only aid in extracting 
the cap is an indentation that runs around the periphery of the cap. The 
original idea was to place a 3/8 inch  or 1/2 inch pipe in the 
indentation and then strike the pipe with a hammer. An alternative is to 
use a large brass drift against the exterior edge of the indentation at 
several places and drive the cap out or try a large set of water pump 
pliers to lever out the cap. With the cap off, the clamping nut on the 
axle is easily accessed.
