Fast Andy is quite correct. A thin sheet of rubber will do nicely and 
not interfere with the grounding of the antenna. What may confuse 
some people is that RF ground is not the same as electrical ground. 
While the latter needs a physical connection, the former does not. On 
a well designed mag mount antenna, capacitive coupling between the 
base plate and the car body allows RF energy to pass and you get a 
fairly effective ground plane.

If this is a mystery, consider on glass cell phone antennas, there is 
no physical connection between the radio and the antenna. A 
capacitive coupling through the glass passes the RF energy. 

As to mag mounts flying off ... usually they don't. If you mount one 
on a flat surface so there's a good bond between the magnet and the 
body they stick pretty well, although I wouldn't explore the upper 
ranges of the car's performance envelope. Don't mount on  curved 
surface though and when not in use, stick the antenna to a metal 
(ferrous) surface to preserve the magnet.

By the way, I was impressed with you French, Andy.. well done indeed.
