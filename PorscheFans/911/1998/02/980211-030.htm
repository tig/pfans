Waw, this list really works ! Thanks !

I've tried to reply individually to all of you that responded to my
post, but cannot keep up.

Basically, "don't bother with A/C" outnumber "pro A/C", and "sunroofs
don't leak that easily" were the most heard responses. I also got a
lesson in acoustic comfort of a 911, pointing out that the noise a
sunroof (or open window) generates is no big deal considering the
overall noise level of a 911 (I only drove one once and I know what you
mean).

Now, about the subject line :

I hope I do not offend anyone on this list, but my (modified) Miata is a
lot harder, noisier and less comfortable than a 911. It won't go that
fast (although I lap the Zolder racing circuit here in Belgium in about
the same time as your average 911 driver), but sure handles great. And
it does not have anything electric or assisted. 

Here in Belgium, only 10 percent of the cars have A/C (this portion is
rising because Japanese car makers give you the A/C for free, and the
European brands slashed the price of their A/C option by 75 percent). I
drive a Cadillac Catera (the US equivalent to my Opel Omega) as a daily
driver, and it has an high-end electronic A/C. It's on all year round,
and has because a comfort plus. 

Because an 88 or 89 Carrera comes with the comfort goodies (electric
everything and occasionally A/C), I've posted the comfort oriented
questions. But deep down, I'm glad the "don't bother with A/C" came out
on top. 

The response to the wheel/tire size and lowering question was
interesting too. "Keep it as it is" is at par with "raise it to
standard" and apparently the wider wheels at the rear will help the car
to be more stable. 

Well, this weekend I'm going for a test drive and will have to convince
the seller to agree on an independent third party check of the car (this
is not customary in Belgium, we'll see how he reacts).

Question to the list : any specific points I have to look for during the
test drive ? I'll also ask for the car to be put on a car lift, so I can
inspect it's "belly". Any suggestions what to look out for ?

Greetings from Belgium, a possible happy 911 owner soon,
