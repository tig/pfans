<<I have a full B&B system on my 90 C4.. the tip (which is about 6" long by 5"
Dia. square/oval and takes a 90 degree turn) seems to have gone missing...  I
suspect it resonated off back in Wilsonville Oregon while scaring minivans
doing about Mach 10 ..... i suspect that if it hit one of the minivans though,
it would have caused endless damage, if not alltogether boring a hole through
one... (its nice to know we use quality parts..) anyhow....  I called up B&B
and I can't just order another one.. it seems as though each part is custom
fabricated ("by thier craftsmen") and I would need to send the entire muffler
back for a new fitting session.. this seems extreme.. I wonder if our B&B boys
in Arizona have ever heard of modern maufacturing methods and
standardization?? what to do
now?? I called some local shops and nobody works in stainless... I was toying
with the idea of taking a Borla tip and getting a place to weld/tack it on
with the inferior mild steel.. I'm getting nervous as, just with the tip gone,
its L O U D !! .. its insane..
and i think i'll melt my rear bumper cover....

any ideas??>>

If B&B won't assist, how about going down to the nearest newstand and picking
up any number of magazines featuring sporty VW's, Acura's, Honda's, etc. I was
browsing through one today and noticed a stainless steel exhaust tip
advertisement on every other page. Of course they're not bent 90 degress,
they're round, not oval, but they're only $30 a pop and with a choice of
diameters. You could get your friendly muffler center to fabricate the 90 deg.
bend and attach it onto the B&B system. Let's see, how about Corvettes? Don't
they have oval exhaust tips? 

Or.... you could try calling B&B again and get a hold of the big boss and see
what he has to say about it. I bet he sees the wisdom in not having to pay UPS
to send your entire exhaust system back to you after they hang a tailpipe onto
the muffler.
