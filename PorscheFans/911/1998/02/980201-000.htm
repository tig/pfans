P-fans,

I took delivery of a 1998 C4S and due to an oversight of the dealer it 
came without the rear window wiper. He has now offered to order the 
parts and retrofit the unit against list price. It would correct the 
oversight but not sure whether it is a good idea at all. Has any body 
experience with the results of replacing the rear window in a 993 ? My 
dealer (as probably most others) has no experience with a 993 rear 
window and has difficulty to guarantee a fit as nice as done by the 
'factory'. So am I asking here for trouble?

Furthermore I noticed from the factory optionlist (original computer 
print found in the car) that the car was made 'ohne ECE-regl.' (code 
323). Anybody any clue what this means ? The car has come with the 
catalytic converters, sensors etc. and runs on unleaded fuel only.  Am 
I correct that only the Turbo comes with an exhaust emission control 
system with dashboard warning indication? My control light 'CHECK 
ENGINE' does not work (which is in line with the instruction manual) 
and there is also no 'catalytic converter temperature' relay installed.

How can one tell whether the car has the 'Euro' springs or not ?

Thanks,
Dirk
