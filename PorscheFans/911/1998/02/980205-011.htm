>>  I was ready to pop off the flywheel in preparation
for mounting it on a stand when I noticed one of the holes to attach the
tranny looked funny.  Sure enough, it's stripped out.  There are some threads
down deep, but effectively, it is REALLY stripped out.  So I figure I have the
option of tapping it out for a larger bolt, or using a helicoil or timesert.
Tapping out to a larger size I can do; helicoil I think I can do; timesert I
should probably take to a shop.  It seems to me that this is a pretty
important
thread, so I'd like to make the strongest possible fix.  Which option would be
the wisest?  The stripped hole is the upper left one, as your facing the
flywheel,
in case that makes any difference. <<

A similar thing happened to me last spring when reinstalling my tranny
to my engine after a tranny rebuild. The hex nut that goes through
the starter to the engine would not torque right, kept turning.
I thought the nut was stripped so I loctited it and installed the
engine. Luckily (?) the tranny rebuild s$%^d so I pulled the
tranny off again for another rebuild. Next time I tightened
that hex nut I realized the stud into the engine that it attached 
to was slowly pulling out of the engine - Ahhhh!

In a panic I visited Dan Jacobs at Danbury Porsche and he
calmly told me it was an easy repair with a timesert.
That is the right way to repair it and not hard to DIY.
He lent me his kit and I was successful. You basically drill
a hole with a slightly recessed edge (special tool included
in kit). Then you tap the hole for the bigger timesert
threads. Not hard to do in magnesium. 
Then you screw in the timesert with the other tool
and, as BOB would say, GIDDYUP!!!
