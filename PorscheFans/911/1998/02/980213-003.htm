This thread represents what this list is all about,  a great forum for
discussion and an exchange of information.  Just Great!!!

Regarding bushings;  Chip Evaul's offer is a good one. This might be
worth pursueing for the folks who have the terminal squeaking problem.
Unfortunately for me, I am old enought to remember when plastic bushings
were introduced and were really in vogue. Those early ones were made
from Delrin, a type of nylon and Teflon. Both of these materials were
harder and more suitable for racing than the OEM ones but they both
exhibited the dreaded "Cold-flow" characteristics. They slowly deformed
under load after a while and changed their shape. In addition, the
Delrin absorbed moisture and swelled enough to REALLY squeak like the
dickens!
  Polyurethane, used in the right durometer, doesn't exhibit the same
"cold-flow" problems and has a good static memory. When molded with
graphite or molybdenum disulfide, it has some self-lubricating
properties.

All of the thermoplastic bushings offered today require handfitting and
lubrication to offer the least static friction (stiction) and quietest
operation. In
our experience, if the above conditions are met, they will be almost as
quiet as the stock rubber bushings. We have several cars that are on the
road over 18 yrs with the Weltmeister polyurethane bushings packed with
Swepco # 101 moly grease that are still quiet. We learned the same way,
they must be fitted (clearanced) to fit and not bind, once torqued in
place.

Some time ago, I had a discussion with Mike Piera about bushing greases.

There is another "super grease" that we tried on a conditional basis
that, if tested under controlled conditions, may prove itself to be THE
answer to this problem. It is very expensive, and used by many IndyCar
teams, Winston Cup teams and some F1 folks as well. Called Krytox, it is
a very special line of greases that solve a mryiad of problems. Did I
say it was expensive?

It solves many CV joint and wheelbearing problems in very-highly
stressed conditions and may be worth trying in bushing applications
since it would require very little. Available from Miller-Stephenson
Chemical, one should add this to the repetoire, oui?  One pound tubes
are,........$120.00 (gasp)

Sure saved our bacon with some CV problems at Daytona!

Installing the zerk fittings is, without a doubt, a super idea as
outline by Walt.
The rear spring plate inner bushings are problematic and need to be
fitted to be sure that its doesn't bind since its so difficult to "zerk"
that bushing. Drilling holes may not be the solution for everyone since
that could cause corrosion problems later. No matter what you do, spend
the time to clearance these polyurethane bushings for longest service.
