An article about autocross appeared in a local throwaway weekly here in San
Diego, and one of the racers interviewed was talking about his 2.7 motor being
"cryogenically treated" by freezing it at -310F for 24 hours.  What is up with
that? He claims the metallurgy changes at a molecular level and it becomes
stronger/harder/tougher.  Says it's an aerospace process NASA invented. I've
never heard of that before, but I'm certainly not an experienced racer.  So
are all you hardcore guys out there freezing your motors?  I'd sure like to
hear about the physics involved.

The same motor was then supposedly treated with a "dry film lubricant" which
is "baked in" to provide protection for moving parts even if "all the oil"
drained out.  Is this BS, or a misinterpretation by the author (which wouldn't
surprise me as he misspelled Bob Wollek's name in the article)?  What product
is he talking about? 

I'm dubious, but the racer is presented as a very experienced mechanic, having
served on Wollek's winning Daytona team, among other accomplishments.  I have
seen the car and actually talked with the guy and his partner at an autocross
last summer, but these two treatments were never mentioned at that time.  The
car is supposed to be very fast, although it was their first day out with it
and they were still sorting it out.
