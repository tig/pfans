Hey P-Fans,

I've got several questions and would appreciate input from anyone and all as
I've found this forum to be very effective. Also promise to not ask about
tires too! 

1. I have a micro fiche reader (actually two) and am in the process of having
the parts fiche copied and separated into multiple fiche sheets that are of
the "right" American standard to fit the classic fiche readers available here.
This should eliminate cutting the fiche in pieces to make it "readable". Many
of you know what I mean here. If it works well I'll copy everyone with the
results and details.  Question I have are the service/repair  manuals
available on fiche?, If so from where?

2. This is an old question for the list at least from me. I have never gotten
a response so really need help here. On the engine compartment fuse box the is
a black finned  "module'  that bolts to the back end of the fuse box. It's not
the CDI control unit. It has two wires that used to go to it but PO cut
them???? WHat the hell is this thing?  If anyone has the Technical Spec book
it's shown on the diagram for the 86 911 turbo but has not note asa to what it
is. Mines an 84 Targa and does have rear defroster and heated windshield and
mirrors. Rear window defrosts fine, windshield does not nor do mirrors. Don't
know if this is connected or them or not? If not any ideas on how to trouble
shoot front winshield and mirror defrosting? 

3. Clock works intermittently as far as keeping correct time. There is a
louder click sound that comes from dash and appears to originate from clock.
It happens about every couple of seconds? ANy idea about fixing the clock, Can
it be fixed? Is it worth it? 

Thanks in advance for any help from the list.
