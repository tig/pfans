Hi,

Very true that you will pay more for maintenance in a C2, and you'll need
to account for this before buying. The car is more complex than a Carrera,
more things to break, etc, and even a tune-up is more expensive - twice
the spark plugs, rotors, etc.

Probably true... I rationalized this by knowing that I've waited 20 years
to own a 911 and I'm not likely to sell it anytime soon ;^)

Different strokes indeed.... I like both, but I kinda like having a body
style that was only made for 4 years!

Indeed!!!

Cheers,
