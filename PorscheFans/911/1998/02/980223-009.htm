Well, after an eventful spin through Little Tujunga Canyon (north of
LA) I find myself in the unenviable position of needing some serious
transmission work.  I've completely lost 2nd gear.  My wrench seems to
think the best course of action is to get a used tranny in good shape,
and use that to replace my current one before I tear into it and see
what needs to be done.

So basically, I'm looking for a good solid 901/911 transmission for a
1971 911T.  If you have one for sale let me know.  I'd prefer
something within a couple of hours of LA so I can check it out before
I buy it.

Since I'll be dropping the engine, I want to replace the Engine Sound
Proofing material, so if anyone has that I might be interested as
well.

Lastly, does anyone have an extra 11 bladed fan they'd like to sell?

71 911T (sans 2nd gear)

Garth Gregoire
