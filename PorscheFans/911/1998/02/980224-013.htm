 " During a shift, it also takes a couple seconds
to drop from the shift point (~4k) down to
2k rpm.  Also, if I'm not pressing the gas while
in any gear, it will stay around 2k rpm."

Hello Stephen.  Someone had also written yesterday regarding a high idle
problem similar to yours.  Having just solved my high idle problem, let me
share what I found out. :-)

There were two items that caused my high idle in my '79 930.  I had a small
hole in my throttle body which allowed air to leak in and screw up the
sensor.  So check to see if you have an air leak.  I also had a faulty
auxiliary air valve which had to be replaced.  They have a tendency to rust
and/or get sticky over the years of getting heated and reheated.
Supposedly this is an inexpensive part and easy to get to and fix (my
mechanic fixed it for me for free).

Hope this helps.

Troy
