Hi, Ken,

My recollection is that Porsche DID move up to a wider rear 16 inch
rim in '89.

Pre -'89 cars were 6" front and 7" rear, the '89s were 6" front and 8" rear.

I have an old note from Steve Timmins filed away, in which he says:

> BTW;  Standard offsets are as follows:
> 
> 911/930 -10.8 or -23mm (911 7 or 8" are 10.8, 9" are 23, so they put

> 944 through '86  -23mm
> 944 late/C2/993  -53 mm
> 928  -53 or -60mm
> 993tt rear 40mm.

Hope this helps...
