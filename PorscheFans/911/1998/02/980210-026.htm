The symptoms you describe can be produced by a failed connection to the
antenna or a failed antenna booster amp. AM is easily recieved with almost
any form of antenna. FM requires line-of-sight signals, so your dealership
is too close to the FM transmitter(s) you were listening to for it to
exhibit the symptoms. Choose a station with a more distant transmitter and
try again.

My radio has suddenly begun exhibiting these symptoms too. I will first
check the connections: not only the antenna, but the power plug for the
antenna power booster. If those are both okay, I'll be in the exact same
spot you are. So we'll see what my dealer says...
