Bruce wrote a book "911 Performance Handbook" and is a regular contributer 
to Excellence.

This book is a compulsory purchase for any 911 owner yet alone one who even 
contemplates doing work on his or her own car.

I was fortunate enough to meet Bruce when he visited NZ. As well as being an 
extremely approachable person  is very knowledgeable. He conducted a three 
hour plus technical seminar including talk and slide show on many of his 
race and Targa experiences ... everyone present was thoroughly entertained 
and would gladly have kept Bruce down here much longer, hopefully he will 
return soon.

I understand he runs similar sessions in the US and would recommend that you 
attend, what I cant understand is how anyone who lives and breathes Porsches 
hasnt heard of Bruce ...

Subject: Who is Bruce Anderson?
Date: Thursday, 19 February 1998 04:43AM

I have been into P-cars since birth.  Own a '87 Carrera.  Drive it every
day, even in the snow.  Try to do all the work on it myself.  (Some
things are beyond my ability and I know when to take it to my wrench.) I
have heard the name of Bruce Anderson mentioned many times, always
refered to in quite high regards.  (I believe he wrote a book
with/by/for Vic Elford on driving technique which I have misplaced...
Clutz)  Anyway...I am always looking for advice from a knowledgable
P-car person.  Bruce, if you are out there, or anyone else who knows, is
there a bulliten board where you answer questions?  Have you written a
book(s) on the finest autos under the sun? etc.  Please let me know.  I
am ALWAYS hungry for knowledge.

Thank you in advance for your time!

each.  The carburators on the last three need to be rebuilt. ;) )
