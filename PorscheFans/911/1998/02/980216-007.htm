I spent the whole sunday morning trying to fix a similar problem 
with my 88  Coupe and I did measure the temp sensor when cold and 
then when warmed up. The results were:-

Cold = 2200 ohms   (approx 3 deg C)
Hot  = 210 ohms     (oil temp approx 90 deg C)

But this was the original temp sensor with only 1 wire.

BTW I had idle problems, sometimes the engine would stall when 
coming to a stop, other times it would sit there alternating RPM's 
between 500 and 1500 and then eventually settling down at 850, 
particularly just after being started. I also seemed to have a slight 
flat spot when accelerating just off the idle position, ie pulling 
away in 1st.

In the end I did the obligatory strip down of the idle control valve 
and sprayed carb cleaner in it whilst opening and closing the valve 
with a thin plastic stick. The result, well it was like a dream come 
true, started it and it settled at 850 almost immediately and when I 
drove it the flat spot I mentioned was a lot less pronounced. So I 
took it for a good old wellie. At all the junctions I came to the 
engine just idled perfectly so I thought all was fixed. NO. IT 
WASN'T.

After driving hard for about 5 miles I came to a stop and the 
thing refused to idle below 1500 - 1700 RPM. It seemed the idle valve 
was now stuck open.  Back to base for a re-think.

This time the idle valve came out again and I found that the valve
bit seemed less reluctant to move. (I was able to open/close the 
valve by a quick flick of the wrist but now it wouldn't)  I think 
that the carb cleaner which is a very powerful solvent left the valve 
very dry (no lube whatsoever) and although it had cleaned out the 
built up gunk inside the valve it left it with no lubrication . So I 
sprayed a mixture of WD40 and very thin 3in1 type oil in it whilst 
jiggling with the valve. That has certainly fixed the idle problem 
for now (I did it last month) but I am not convinced that the valve 
isn't on its last legs. But at least I know that it  is the sole 
cause of my idle problem.

Whilst I am in a completely verbal run-away mode  I might as well 
also write about my findings on an  whistle coming  from the 
intake manifold.

I used to be able to play tunes with the throttle 
when the car was on a  light load in 3rd or 4th @ approx 2000 RPM 
just by depressing/releasing the accelerator slightly. I did nearly 
perfect "Happy Birthday" albeit at the expense of fuel consumption.

Anyway I tightened down the intake manifold, which all the bolts 
seemed to want to turn about 1/8 - 1/4 turn but with no success. It 
was only when checking/adjusting the idle speed after shorting the 
test connector that I noticed air was entering the throttle body at 
the adjusting screw. Whilst screwing in or out the adjuster I could 
hear an air leak sound come and go as it rotated. So I unscrewed the 
adjuster, lubricated the O-Ring with silicon grease and re-assembled 
it. No more leaks. Now I will just have to stick with the piano. 

Sorry for length mail, hope this might be of some help.
