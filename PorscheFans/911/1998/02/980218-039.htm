I recently purchased a 1976 912E.  While I love the car, it does have one
problem.  All three keys that the PO provided were all extremely  worn
down.  Two of the three stopped working within a month (they can open
both doors, but the won't fit in the ignition unit), and I am now on my 
last key (which I have had duplicated of course).  The problem is that
this key can't always fit without a little work (Last week I spent about 5
minutes  in a less then ideal part of Oakland trying to work it in). I am
worried that it will stop working altogether like the others.  

I did order brand new keys for the dealership, but these are so sharp they
don't even come close to opening the doors or the starting the motor.  So
my current dilema is that I now have two keys that are too dull, and two
that are too sharp.  Has anyone else had this problem?
