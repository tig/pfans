Hello everyone,
I am fairly new on the list having recently bought a decently restored
1970 911T Targa about 6 weeks ago (and driven it everyday since). I
would appreciate any opinions on the following observations I have had
about the car.

1) Now I don't consider myself a "wimp", but....this car is much less
"driveable" on a daily basis than my '67 912 was...

I realize the 911T was the detuned, carbureted entry level 911, but it is
not a fan of stop and go, idling, starting quickly in cold weather
(California cold, that is) or shot distance commutes. The 912 handled all
that well...

It also has the "sport" transmission with the dog leg first gear so I spend
much too much time thinking about what gear I am in...

I find it to be much more of a single purpose sports car than the 912
which had more (please pardon me) VW/356-ish driveability.

2) The Targa top is extremely noisy. Can the top be adjusted to eliminate
wind noise? My Haynes 911 manual does not discuss this...

3) The steering is extremely light...It has wider than original Dunlop tires
and zero play in the steering, but the steering is "power steering" light.

I understand that this pointed to ball joints in very early 911's but that
was resolved by 1970. What can this be?

4) It gets an optimistic 15 mpg in a mix of fast street and freeway driving.
The "seller" (vague to protect the innocent) proclaimed it would get 20+.
Is this due to short distance driving/cold running? In addition to this the tail
pipe is fairly black. The "seller" is adamant that the Zeniths are in perfect
adjustment.

Please feel free to reply on any of the subjects, especially the wind
noise. Go ahead and flame me about the 912 stuff if you feel you have
to......I have thick skin.

Thanks to all,

Eric
1970 911Targa
