Wes,
  Here's the short version of _my_ method for jacking the
car up to remove the engine. (I've done it 6 times in
the last three years.)
1. Get the front of the car up on ramps so it can roll
   back and forth a little when you jack up the back.
   It also keeps the front spoiler from getting pushed
   into the cement when you raise the rear of the car.
2. My jackstands aren't tall enough to hold the rear
   the 3-4 feet in the air required to remove my 3.2L.
   I had over a dozen 2x12x18" blocks made up. These
   are stackable and wide enough that I can put a jack
   stand on top of them.
3. Use a 2x10 about 3ft long under the rear firewall.
   I jack in the middle of the board with the jack 
   going under the car from the side diagonally so it
   isn't in the way of putting jackstands under the
   torsion bar ends or jack points. 
4. The jack won't go high enough to get the car all 
   the way up. I put boards on top of the jack to get 
   the extra height. 

   be careful,
     Chris

P.S. I don't particularly like my method so I'm CCing 
    the 911 list for critical analysis.
