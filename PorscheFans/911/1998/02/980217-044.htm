Hi People, I'm new to this group, but was told it's a good place to ask =
questions.  I have an 87 with 119K on that is starting to show its age.  =
In Pano, I've seen a place called Motor Meister out of Californina that =
will do a long block exchange on a 3.2 for $3995.00.  Has anyone used =
them and if so, with what results.  I don't know if this is the best way =
to go or not.  Would I be better off going the route of having it =
rebuilt locally?  I don't want to spend an arm and a leg, so I looking =
for good job at reasonable cost.  Thanks.

Bill Schnellman
