The following message is forwarded from James Bricken:

Aside from the dirt and grease which you have to deal with anytime you
service the CVs or the axles; I paid $175 just to have CVs rebuilt. That
was suppose to include machining, new cages, new bearings. The machining
looked like it was done with a Dremal tool and technician lied several
times about the replacing the cages (never did get the story straight)
but installed the same old ones with no attempt to correct them (I ended
up doing that myself). I suspect the average person probably would not
have known if they were right or not. No, you can't really do it
yourself (or I would have). You need new oversized bearings and the
ability to machine the surfaces with precision.  You can do the service
yourself, which consists of cleaning and replacing with grease (special
moly grease like Swepco 101). You should also replace the boots and
gaskets at the same time and be sure to torque to the proper
specification.

Subject: Rebuilt CV Joints

Greg,
Please tell us more about the "unpleasant experience". I'd be interested
in knowing what he paid, and what they did for a "rebuild". They can be
serviced by a DIY-er, but it is a dirty, greasy, messy, (did I say
greasy?) job.
