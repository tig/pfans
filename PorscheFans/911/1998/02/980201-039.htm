Warning, my usual long post:

David,

You want a consensus on tires? From THIS list? Would you accept 1500
different opinions instead? Well, here's mine, anyway. I previously had 
BFG Comp TA ZRs on 17-in rims for my C2. They were OK, if a little loose
at times(I don't think they really like the high factory air pressures),
but I was quite satisfied. 
	Recently I switched to the Porsche spec. Michelin Pilot SX MXX3s. They
ride more smoothly, but seem to have equal or better grip (as high as I
ever want at the track, anyway). If you can afford the initial outlay, I
think you will find they last much longer than similar tires. 
	What swayed me was the realization that as much as I live for those 6
or 8 days at the track each year, most of my driving is done on the
road. The MXX3s seem to deliver performance nearly as high or as high as
the Bridgestone S02, but with maybe higher levels of performance in the
non-track categories like ride, long tread life and, something I had not
thought of before, "consistency of performance from new to old".  For a
lot better explanation than mine, try http://www.michelin.com/index.html
	
OK, who agrees with me? Raise your hands. C'mon, somebody?

P.S.
I don't work for Michelin, but wish I did. I could use the discount.
