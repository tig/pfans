I'd be very wary of re-using a torsion bar that has any kind of nicks or "wear"
marks on them.  By definition, the outermost portion of a torsion bar sees
the highest stresses during loading - any nicks, scratches, etc., could lead
to failure of the bar.

The wear mark you're seeing is due to the rubber bushing deforming to the
point where the torsion bar is actually rubbing on the car.  That would scare
me.  If it were me, I'd replace the torsion bars (used stock ones are dirt
cheap, if you don't want to upgrade) and I'd install some polyurethane
bushings to help ensure this doesn't happen again.  I know your thinking,
"Yeah, but the poly bushings will squeak like crazy!!".  Mine have been in
for 2 years now and they hardly make any noise.
