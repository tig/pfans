Hello fellow P-fans,

The night blue 88 Carrera passed all tests (see below though) at Porsche
Belgium, so I'll go for it and join the Porsche family. Some minor
things need to be done, and the seller agreed to get those fixed. The
car will also be raised a little (we did a test drive in Brussels this
afternoon, and the car bottoms out too fast). The price was
non-negotiable, but hey, better pay a reasonable price for a good car
than get a wreck at a price. The car should be mine this weekend ...

I'm still confused on the leakdown results though. They read between 10
and 24 % (!!!). The mechanics at Porsche Belgium explained that up to 15
% is normal and higher is possible due to the fact the measurements were
done cold. They also mentioned that adding an engine cleaning agent to
the petrol at the next fill will get rid of carbon deposits that
probably are the cause of the high leakage numbers. The chief mechanic
took the car (I was a passenger) for a testdrive and his verdict was :
car and engine in excellent condition, don't worry about the leakdown
numbers, engine is in perfect shape (and yes, I'll have to revisit my
former comments on "unimpressed by the power ..."). By the way,
compression was between 9.5 and 10.5 bar.

Any reason this deal can go sour still ? (grasping at straws to delay
the buying decision or last change not to make a costly mistake ?)
 
Thanks, 

Peter
