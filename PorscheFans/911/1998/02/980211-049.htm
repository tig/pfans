Hi, Rick,

I'd say "Hell yes"!

I own a '90 C2 coupe. If you check for the various well-known problems in
these cars (cylinders, distributor, flywheel) then you should have no problem.

Most early C2s will have had the flywheel explode by now, so you should be
safe there (CHECK receipts to make sure it was replaced with the LUK style
flywheel). Mine had this done.

Very few had problems with cylinder sealing. Mine has 71,000 km with the
original cylinders - no sign of leaks. The impression I got in talking to
people before I bought this car is that if it hasn't leaked by this time,
it likely won't. It *is* a very expensive repair if it happens - if you're
lucky, the PO will have had the problem and made the fix already. Check
receipts to be sure! If I ever have to have the top end apart, I'll update
the parts, but I'm not worried about it at the moment.

The distributor problem is fixable with a very inexpensive venting kit. I
had that done to mine when I bought the car. I still check from time to time
(take the caps off and make sure both rotors turn) to be sure that the belt
is in good shape. I remember seeing recently that belts are now available
separately (you used to have to replace the whole distributor if the belt
broke). In most cars, a belt breaking just lead to a slight loss in power. In
very few cars, the rotor stopped in a BAD place leading to detonation in one
cylinder. A rebuilt distributor is on the order of $600 to $1000 or so - not
bad in the grand scheme of things.

The only other issue with the 964s is the perception that they will not hold
their value as well as either the earlier Carreras or the 993s. Whether this
matters to you or not is up to you - it makes no difference to me, I get a
car that's updated in more ways than I can shake a stick at from the Carrera,
but I retain the classic 911 shape (plus I couldn't afford a 993 ;^)

Your best bet is to drive both before making your mind up. The cars are
similar but different. If you have a requirement to carry golf clubs in
the trunk, forget the 964 ;^) the trunk is smaller and shaped differently.
The brakes on the Carrera are very very good - on the 964 they're awesome.

Cheers!

Ross
