I had a problem with my car starting and here is the story.

1) Occasionally the car would crank but not start.  Very
random.  Mostly in warm weather. 2) We figured a way to
force it by jumping the fuel pump relays and causing them to
start manually. 3) Problem seemed to disappear for a while.
4) Car was in shop getting heater fixed and it acted up
again.  Mechanic tried the relay jumping but no go.  He said
the CD ignition box was dead.  Replaced it with a Perma Tune
unit. Started right up.  Never had another starting problem. 
This was just recently. 5) When I got the car back, I
noticed the fuel pumps were now coming on when i turned the
ignition key on.  This never happened before.  Mechanic said
this should not happen.  Took it back to shop. 6) Mechanic
said turbo boost limiter switch was grounding out.  Replaced
it.  Said problem was fixed. 7) First time I started car
when i got it back, fuel pumps still came on.  Car back in
shop for spoiler fix, they will check the pump thing too.

My questions:
A) What may be causing this?
B) I talked to Perma Tune and they suggested a new coil to
go with the new CD box. C) Permatune guy said fuel pump
relays should come on when they see a spark at the coil.  Is
this true?

I am worried my original problem has not been fixed and the
"new" act of the pumps coming on is masking that and making
it look like all is well.  Someone on this list a while back
said I need a new coil.  I am going to get one but I wonder
if this is going to help my situation.

Any and all comments/ideas/suggestions are welcome.
