Ok, here's a not-so-hypothetical question ;^)

First, the details...

Car is a '90 C2 coupe, with 16" wheels. Currently needs tires. Suspension,
etc, is stock.

I have X amount of money to spend on handling/looks upgrades. EVENTUALLY
(over the course of a couple of years) I'd like to end up with the
car lowered a bit, stiffer (especially roll stiffness, dive, squat), and
running on 17" wheels & tires.

- I can perhaps stretch my budget right now to swapping my 16" wheels for
17" ones (needing tires anyway helps me here!) AND adding some lowering
springs - H&R perhaps, or Eibach (posted another note about that!). I would
then upgrade shocks and sway bars next year.

- Or, I can do more suspension work - springs/shocks and MAYBE sway bars
for the same $$$. I'd have to stick with the 16" wheels and upgrade
them next year.

Both these options lead to the same result eventually. I'm leaning towards
the first.

The car is primarily a street vehicle, and I'd like to retain a reasonably
comfortable street ride. I do want to lower and reduce body roll somewhat
for the benefit of autocross and driver's-ed events - probably a total
of 6 or 8 events per year at the moment.

I'd appreciate any comments!

Thanks,

Ross
