   I need help,
      I'm trying to cure a high speed steering wheel vibration that is
not always present.  Maybe 75% of SoCal frwy driving my wheel's got the
shakes but then there are periods of relative calm.  If a wheel is out
of balance whouldn't it shake all the time  at a given speed?  My local
tire guys say they can balance the wheels on the car but before I do
that I wanna make sure everything else looks ok.  I believe rotors are
ok cause I'm not getting any pulsing sensations.  I've jacked up the
front end and feel that my rf wheel bearing has considerable more play
than the lf wheel and herein is my problem.  How does the bearing cap
come off?  Is there something I'm missing?   I've tried channel locks
but I
can't get the bugger to move.  Do I have to take off what looks like a
wheel spacer first?
One other thing, car is an '86 w 83K on original boge shocks.
Car tracks straight & true running D40 's  I 've read on this list that
shocks can be a contributing factor but i'd like to try the simplest
<less costly> things first.

TIA,
