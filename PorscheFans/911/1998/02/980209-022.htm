Here is one for the books....Last week I am driving my 81 SC with the 
targa down and enjoying the day...All of a sudden the car will only 
shift in 2nd gear and fourth gear. I freaked out and granny gear it to 
my home.. I raised the car to take a good look underneath, and behold my 
2 bolts that hold the transmission to the cross member on the frame fell 
out...The shift rod could not move, so I could not get any other 
gears..I went to the local Porsche dealer, and he said that he  did not 
have one in the whole Country...So I went to a Local Napa dealer, and 
Guess what? he had the bolt for 6 dollars, I put the bolts back on and 
the damn thing shifts better than before..Just luck I guess..So I would 
suggest that you check the bolts on the tranny, just in case.
