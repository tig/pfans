Response to MSDS filter.
The cold air box is a good idea but because the engine bay of a Porsche
is fairly well sealed, where do you get the cold air from outside from?
I had thought about the same thing when I purchased mine and was going
to use some of that big 5 or 6 inch flexible drain tubing  to route air
to the cone filter but could find no place on to outside to route it to.
Any suggestions you have for this cold air box would be appreciated.  In
my first response to this question, I said that I use a turbo twister. 
What I meant was that I used the SpiralMax to smooth the flow of air. 
It is supposed to reduce turbulance.  Another problem with the cone
filter on at least older engines is that the foam pad at the back of the
engine bay which is supposed to reduce noise is usually falling apart
and those particles can more easily enter the exposed cone filter.  I
put up a sheet of alluminum in front of the pad and behind the filter to
reduce this.
