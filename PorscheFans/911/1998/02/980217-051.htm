I saw the new 996 at the Toronto Autoshow yesterday, and I must say that It
definitely is a Porsche...but is it a 911?  Form follows function, and the
996 is definitely a functional shape, (i.e. cd of 0.30 I believe, more
aerodynamic).  But a lack of fender flares...I can't really see this car
being made into an "RS" version, as its too big.  I think people have
mentioned that its more of a GT car, and I kinda think so too.  I like the
front end, but I don't like the fact that it shares that with the boxster.
I want to see the turbo version when it comes.  I can't see how porsche will
fit larger tires without adding flares though.
