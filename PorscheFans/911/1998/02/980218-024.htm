Hi PFans,

I've been lurking on the list now for a few months while I've been in the
market for an old 911.  So far, common sense (and Bruce Anderson's book)
have been steering my decisions on which ones are worth buying and which
are not.  But I've come across one 911 that is particularly strange and I
am looking for some input from others...

First, I'd like to explain my 911 goals.  I simply want a 911 for
autocrossing and track events.  I'd like it to be reliable enough to be a
daily driver.  I don't care if it's "all original".  I don't intend to show
it.  It just has to run like mad!  I don't like autocrossing my new
audi...and I don't think it will stand up to regular abuse the way a 911 will.

The car I've got questions about is a '69 911S, european model.  The car
has a pretty rough history, none of which has been documented.  But the
chassis VIN # is very strange.  The current owner has done some checking on
it and the factory told him it is a #7 Factory Re-Chassis of 1972.  Does
anyone know what this means?  

All I can think of is that the european owner wrapped it around a tree.  He
then called the factory asking for a bare chassis, which he then installed
all the parts from the '69 S into.  But this chassis doesn't have the
externally mounted oil filler (on the right rear fender) that geniune
1972's have.  And I also wonder if it is still a short-wheelbase 911 (as
the early ones were), or the '72 chassis lengthened it's wheelbase.

Should I even consider buying this car?  I'm going to check it out this
weekend where it's scheduled to be a guinea pig for a PCA tech inspection
education seminar.
