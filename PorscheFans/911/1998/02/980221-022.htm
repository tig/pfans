Hi P' Fans:
First, I'd like to thank eveyone for posting tips on this newsletter. I've
picked up lots of great ideas.
My question concerns valve adjustments. I've owned my car for 1.5 years and
figured it was my turn in the barrel to do the valves especially since I
didn't know when the last time the PO had them done. I did them today and all
the valves were perfect. I talked with two other carrera owners('84 and '89)
and they said the same thing. Every time they ever checked their valves they
never had to adjust any. All three of us use our cars as daily drivers and
don't race them on tracks(only deserted roads). I spoke with my mechanic and
he admitted that it is rare that the valves go out of adjustment but that it
was still a good idea to check them. His advice was to check them every 30K if
the car is used as a daily driver and is not raced on the track. 
What is the opinion of the group on this? Seems like the Porsche recommended
adjustment every 15K miles is ultra conservative. The 30K adjustment interval
seems reasonable based on my small sample.
