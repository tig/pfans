I am trying to get my car together for summer and was wondering how I
could upgrade the Brakes on my '66 911.  I also have been told that what
I had diagnosed as loose bearings on the front was in fact worn
spindles.  This car has 290,000 miles on it so that diagnosis does not
sound unreasonable to me.  I was figuring that if I was going to replace
the struts maybe I should upgrade the brakes. Also if I want to upgrade
the brakes I think I have to upgrade the struts.  This car is used
primarily for drivers Ed.

 What I have:
Essentially original equipment
Single Circuit master cylinder
non vented discs
struts with worn spindles
very worn tie rods(ends and U joints)
front  pan that needs replacement due to metal failure near front A arm
mount
6x15 wheels
New Koni shocks

All these components seem related in that a modification of one can only
be done with the replacement of other components.  For example  I need
replace the tie rods so I thought I would upgrade to solid "Turbo"  tie
rods.  To do this I think I need to have 69? or later struts?  If I want
to to go to " S" calipers do I also need the 69 or later struts? Can I
use later brakes with my current master cylinder? I noticed someone is
selling struts from an 87 with brakes.   Could I use these as they are
probably cheaper than the "S" calipers. If I upgrade the front brakes
can I move the OE front brakes to the Rear as I think they have larger
pistons.   I have a 67 S roller and I  think the suspension and brake
parts from that would be direct repacements which is a possibility but
that seems to rule out any "upgrades".


Will later struts fit on a '66 if so are there any years that are better
or to be avoided?

What about brake upgrades?  I think I'm limited on brake upgrades if I
stay with my present struts but I'm not sure.  Thoughts of brake upgrade
were brought about by discovery that I had worn out a new set of
Porterfield pads in 1 drivers ed. event.  (I realize this means I'm
probably brakeing too much).  I don't think there are any larger brakes
that will fit my non vented rotors but, again, I'm not sure.

Thanks for any help
