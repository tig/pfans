Michael:

As far as I know, that's how they're SUPPOSED to work.

Ever wonder why those side-marker lights are often called "parking"
lights?  Apparently, some backward European countries (like France, I
think) require/required the marker light closest to the center of the
road to remain illuminated when the vehicle's parked.

Of course, I could be WAY wrong about this... But the fact that my 
914 does exactly the same thing would tend to support the idea that 
the steady illumination was intentional.
