Quick question to either those on the list that ship engines to
customers, or List members who have had engines shipped to them...

I'm buying a 3.0 liter engine from a "professional shop" in the
SouthEast.  They are now telling me that I need a "loading ramp and
forklift" to get it off the truck!?!  Is this "normal"?  How are these
things normally unloaded at a customer's site (aside from having 6
neighbors that go to the gym on a regular basis :-)?

I need some input as its apparently on the way up here (on the truck I
have to unload a a loading ramp), and while I have a well stocked garage
- forklifts and loading ramps are *not* part of my current inventory...

Thanks In Advance,

John
