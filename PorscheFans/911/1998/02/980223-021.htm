Jordi, 
You need a copy of Bosch Fuel Injection by Probst, it will help you a lot if you 
continue to work with the CIS. The mixture adjustment screw is actually on the 
sensor plate lever, which is just to the right of the control plunger (the round 
part that travels up and down about 1" measuring the flow of air into the 
system.)  To see it (or rather feel where it is since I don't think you ever see it) as 
well as the control plunger, the rounded/ribbed  neoprene duct carrying air 
into the body of the mixture control unit must be removed.  The screw itself is 
reached from the top, and is sometimes covered by a protective cap of some 
kind to discourage adjustment, though mine wasn't. Your special wrench goes 
down from the top and finds the allen-head mixture adjustement screw on the 
sensor plate lever. You do it by feel, though once you know where it is , it's 
really very easy. Remember, 1/4 turn of this screw is a lot. Hope this helps, it's 
not an easy thing to describe.
