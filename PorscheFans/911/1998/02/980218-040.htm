Metalmasters are a pretty decent pad for street use for the reasons
you mention above, but I found that they don't seem to have a nice
"feel" on the track ("feel" is a purely subjective, totally useless qualitative
characteristic for the most part...).  When I originally began tracking
my car, it had factory Jurid or Textar (I don't remember) pads and they
actually worked pretty well, but I wore them out quickly.

For the price, Metalmasters are pretty good pads.  You'll have to spend
alot more money to get something much better.  If your car will see
primarily street duty, I would recommend the Metalmasters.
