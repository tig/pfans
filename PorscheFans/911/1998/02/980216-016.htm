Hi Dennie,
 Your speedo problem will only get worse over time, until it never works.  This 
is a classic 911 problem, which I fixed late last year thanks to the info Wayne 
Michelsen sent me. The hardest part is scraping away the undercoating where the 
sensor grommet plugs into the car frame.  Here is an exact reprint of Wayne's 
response, which I followed without any hitches:

The speedometer sending unit is an inductive pickup sensor
inserted in the driver's side of the transmission case just
above the rear wheel half shaft.  The wire from the sensor
runs up over the tranny and into the center tunnel by
the shift linkage where it plugs into the wiring harness
with a standard tongue type connector.  You can reach
this connector through an access panel to the tunnel located
under the carpet between the footwells of the rear passenger
jump seats.  This whole repair is relatively cheap and easy.
But, it is somewhat dirty as any under car engine area work
is (lots of road grime and caked oil).  Here is my recollection
of the tools/parts needed:
  - New speedo sensor/sending unit (~$35 ?)
  - 10mm socket to remove the sensor from tranny case
  - philips screwdriver to remove tunnel access panel
  - about 1 hour to do it
That's from my fading memory, so there's no guarantee of
accuracy.  But, I know it wasn't difficult.
 
Keep Porsching,
Wayne
