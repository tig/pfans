Art, I previously had a '84 Turbo-Look that I sold with 135,000 miles.
I intially used Castrol, then switched to Castrol synthetic then Mobil
1 synthetic.  

Engine had to come apart at 135,000 due to a seized/snapped spark plug.
Shop said heads were in good shape, onlyu problem were that valve
guides were at wear limit.  Bottom end they said was excellent.  This is on
a car that was at race track weekends prob. 6 times/year, plus 3-4 
autocrosses a year.

You should have no aftereffects due to switch.

Re the chips:  tried about 2-3 chips, incl. Weltmeister.  Did nothing
for performance, one of them caused driveability deterioration.  The mass flow
sensor change, though, does give you better high RPM kick., if 
you are looking for HP upgrade.

advatanges or risks in switching to mobil 1?

Plus and minus on a Weltmiester chip? Rough running? lower mpg?
