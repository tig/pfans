Fascinating. Anyway, sounds like he did not push the circlip, snap ring,
whatever, into it's groove (which should be up against the edge of the
outer tube). This is not easy to do, even with snap ring pliers. I
recommend Harley's handy-dandy oil return tube special purpose clip holder.
I can send you one for  $39.95, they are an after-market Porsche tool, you
know. It takes quite a bit of skill to take a finishing nail and bend it in
the form of a "U" so that the clip is held apart enough to allow it to
slide easily into place! Once in place the groove will hold it while you
pluck the special tool out with a needle-nose pliers.

All joking aside, the tubes must be pressed (somewhat forcibly) into each
side of the case using the raised edge on each end and a screwdriver. This
pressing compresses the O-rings and makes a good seal. When that is done,
the groove in the smaller tube will be visible. Then the clip is slid into
place. The clip fits so tightly on the small tube that when you try to
slide it down into position in the groove it pulls the tube end out. You
can either use a plier or the nail spreader described above to open the
clip to get it to slide into the groove. I have had my collapsible tubes in
place for almost two years--no leaks.

The only other tubes of this sort that I have ever seen are used in VW
engines to cover the pushrods. Those tubes are much smaller than the
Porsche oil-return, I am guessing just a poor installation here.
