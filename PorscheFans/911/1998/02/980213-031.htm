In trying to cure annoying rising and falling revs durring warm up, by
removing and refitting cylinder head temperature sensor, I've caused a
bigger problem !

Now it runs rough, on idle and poor pick-up  (sounds like 5 cylinders !)
hot & cold just like an over rich mixture.

Does anyone have sensor resistance readings for various temperatures ?

Mine is already a 2 wire version, and readings I've got so far are;
Cold = 3200ohms
warm=1650ohms
Normal=680ohms

Roy also suggested  about 3volts cold to less than 2 volts hot

Anyone know exact figures to look for (in Volts or Ohms) ? -  I checked
offical manual (not in), but probably in DME setup guide - does anyone have
access to this ?

Apparently there is an recommended sequence of checking all the DME
functions to locate faulty components - does anyone have this ?

Logic says somehow I've introduced more resistance into the sensor circuit,
but want to thoroughly check out sensor, before blindly renewing parts all
over the place.

BTW Sensor removal too is a long series 15mm (yes fifteen) socket, with
about 4mm, wide slot cut in side (use angle grinder), up to bottom of
square drive end.

BIG THANKS  to Roy Orr, Jon Beatty & Jim Tidwell,

I'll post final results when sorted,

Thanks
