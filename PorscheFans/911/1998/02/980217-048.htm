Just got the engine (and newly rebuilt transmission, complete with
Quaife and 7/31 rear axle etc etc) back in the car and I am perplexed by
a problem....

The starter will not turn the engine over at more than about 10 rpm (aka
very slowly) with spark plugs removed (I am trying to get some engine
oil circulating after its one year enforced hibernation).

I checked the valve clearance before putting the engine back in.....had
to turn it over by hand and had no problem, so I don't believe I have an
engine siezure or some such disaaster.

There were no starting problems prior to the engine removal

Battery has been on charger for 2 days and specific gravity of battery
acid indicates full charge.

Other electrical components (ie headlamps etc) appear bright and seem to
have no problems

Engine ventilation fan seems to be operating at full speed (wondered if
I had a ground strap problem)

Any ideas???

Thanks for any suggestions you may have......
