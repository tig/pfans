Hi Tom:

  Some good questions you raise. Cryogenic treatments and performance
enhancing coatings have been used for more than a decade as an "Unfair
Advantage" by the top racing teams in NASCAR, F1, NHRA, IndyCar,
virually every form of professional racing. Some of these are
proprietary in nature and are used by top engine builders to enhance
reliability as well as add performance. We use some of these
technologies in engines destined for our customers so I'll give no speed
"secrets" away.  :^)

Cryogenic treatment, grossly simplified, changes ferrous metals in such
as way to make them tougher and able to tolerate much greater stress
levels without wear or failure. In Porsches, this applies to
crankshafts, connecting rods, and camshafts, primarily. One also sees
benefits in cryo-treated transmission parts. This process also stress
relieves steel parts. We have also used this on Aluminum parts with
similar results. One of our next projects is to try this on a Magnesium
engine case to see if we can minimize or eliminate the flexing inherent
in these cases. Microscopic examination of the main bearing saddles will
tell us after running a season whether or not we have achieved our goal.

For those interested, I can fax you some data about the physics and
metallurgy of what is happening here. You may contact us through our Web
site!

Performance coatings come in many 'flavors'. There are Thermal Barriers,
Thermal dispersants, and Anti-friction coatings, to name a few. This
technology is just superb, requiring no compromises or tradeoffs to
achieve levels of durability and reliability by effectively managing the
heat created by combustion.
Since every IC engine creates work by making and utilizing the expansion
of hot gasses to push pistons down, anything that will prevent the
migration of heat into the surrounding parts such as cylinders, heads,
pistons, and rings, will make the engine more efficient and extract more
energy from each firing event. Thermal-Barriers applied to combustion
chambers and piston crowns lower oil temperatures, protect pistons and
rings/ring lands from thermal stresses and make more power, longer.
A good example of this is the power sag that you feel in any 911 when
the outside air temperature climbs, or the oil temps rise above 220, or
even under periods of boost in turbo-charged engines. This is from
overheated
(relatively speaking) heads, barrels and pistons. Thermal efficiency
sags at elevated temps although the engine can be more fuel efficient
when hotter.

Anti-friction coatings, applied to piston skirts camshafts, valve faces
and stems, reduce heat buildup and drag in these areas of high friction.
Again, this is most noticed in lower oil temps. Valve stems in
particular, are a weak point in the 911 engine especially turbocharged
ones. These coatings really reduce valve heat and lower guide wear
noticeably.

Thermal Dispersants have been effectively applied to brake hubs nad
calipers, the insides of brake rotors, wheel bearing housings, CV
joints,and even the insides of wheels in trying to rid the car of heat
that shortens bearing life and hastens the onset of brake fade.

Quite obviously, there is lots more to this. You can contact us if you
want more information since the space is quite limited here in this
forum.

Poor 'ol Tom probably wishes that he hadn't opened Pandora's Box  :^)

I hope this prompts some folks to think about all of this. Its free HP
in terms of reliability. The cost is quite reasonable, relatively
speaking.
