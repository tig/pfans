Hi Don:
I couldn't help but immediately e-mail you ASAP in regards to this issue. 
I have a 1979 911SC grey market car that I successfully licensed in CA in
1995.  Pardon the expression, but it was a real bitch to get through the
bureaucracy.  Figure 4 weeks easy.  To further emphasize the ridiculousness
of the problem, my car was already registered in the U.S. for 10 years in
another state.  CA treated the car as though I had just brought it into the
country and basically seized it pending DOT and EPA approval.  The guys at
the lab were pretty cool, but they were not ashamed to charge me upwards of
$3000 for emission testing, EPA certification, and parts ( a catalyst and a
little O2 sensor analog computer ).   Of course the car is only worth
around $10K these days anyway.  It turned out there were DOT papers
federally filed, but no EPA.  This same thing happened to a friend of mine
who bought a grey market car <that was already registered in CA> yet had
been illegally smogged for years.  He spend about the same amount to get
the car legitimate.  The bottom line is, you need a BAR label ( a bar code
from the Bureau of Automotive Repair ) in the driver door opening.   This
BAR label is the key to a hassle-free smog testing life or the potential
loss of your car.  The exception now, may be 1973 and older cars which
supposedly no longer need to be smogged, although DOT approval may still be
needed.  As far as insurance, the biggest problem I had was having to pay
930 turbo insurance ( only $100.00 more per year ) because my VIN on my
coupe was 911930xxxx instead of 911920xxxx like a U.S. model would have
been.  The insurance guy said, "oh, this car is a 930, not a 911."  When I
said, "well it's obviously not a 930" he said, "there's nothing <I> can do,
that's what <they> say."   The amount was so minimal I just blew it off.  I
eventually found a different insurance company and had no problems.  (
Apparent good news for those worried about the higher insurance of a turbo
- it's just about the same as a standard 911 of the same age ).  

Best Regards,
Jim Sandahl
