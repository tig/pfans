I recently reported a near disasterous failure of the pressurized fuel
line in the engine compartment.  What follows is a little background,
and my best post-mortem recollection of the repair.

This document is written with the following perspective as you face the
engine leaning over the back bumper:
Front - refers to the firewall/cabin/3,6 cylinder end of the engine
Back  - refers to the bumper/tail/1,4 cylinder end of the engine
Left  - refers to the driver/1,2,3 cylinder bank side of the engine
Right - refers to the passenger/4,5,6 cylinder bank side of the engine


Parts:
The pressurized fuel line assembly of the '84-'89 Carerras is a
manufactured assembly of brass/alloy tubing and flexible rubber/compound
hose.  The assembly extends from the top of the fuel filter (mounted on
the left side of the engine compartment) across to the middle front of
the engine.  There, it turns 90 degrees and goes under the intake
manifold toward the back (bumper) end of the engine.  Just in front of
the alternator, it branches in a 'T' to connect to the back end of each
fuel rail.
This assembly is Porsche Part #: 930.110.595.05   $478.35

There is a second pressurized 'bypass' fuel line that goes across the
front end of the fuel rails from the fuel pressure regulator on the left
to the fuel pressure damper on the right.  This is also a
rubber/compound hose with crimped end fittings.
This fuel line is Porsche Part #: 930.110.411.00   $31.50


Problem:
It appears that the heat of the engine dries and degrades the rubber
hosing.  The problem is (arguably) accelerated by the new oxygenated
fuel.  Eventually, the rubber hose begins to crack, leak, and in my
case, spray fuel.  Needless to say, this is VERY bad!

I have written this procedure assuming you are replacing both fuel
lines.  Most likely, the main fuel line assembly is the problem, but
considering the relative parts costs, and the trivial added effort to
replace the 'bypass' fuel line...just Alayit.
["As-long-as-your-in-there"]


Remove & Replace:
1. Remove the heater blower and ducting.
  - First, remove the black heated air elbow duct.
      (8mm socket where it connects to the blower, and flat screwdriver
       for the ring clamp where it connects to the heat exchangers)
  - Move the distributor cap out of the way.  Don't disconnect the plug
    wires, just loosen it so you can get at the mounting screws for the
    main heater air intake.
      (screwdriver)
  - Remove the big black heater air intake duct that goes from the
    engine block cover to the squirrel cage fan.  There's one bolt
    at the bottom behind the distributor, one bolt on the side of the
    fan shroud, and two bolts on the backside of the duct.
      (10mm socket and open end wrench for the screws, and a flat
       screwdriver for the ring clamp)
  - Remove the heater blower fan/motor.
      (10mm socket for the three lock nuts)

2. Unbolt the sensor plug holder mounted on the side of the left intake
    manifold.  You don't have to remove nor disconnect the three sensor
    plugs, just unbold the holder from the intake manifold.  It makes
    life easier, later on, if this can be moved around.
      (10mm socket for the two mounting screws)

3. Remove the air filter and air filter box.
  - Unclip the four latches at each corner of the air filter cover
    and remove.
  - Unbolt the air filter box from the air flow meter and remove.
      (10mm socket for the four mounting screws inside the box and the
       lock nuts inside bottom and on the side of the box.  Philips
       screwdriver for the two screws holding the oil breather lines
       mount/support to the side of the air filter box)

** Now life gets harder **
4. Unbolt the fuel line end mounting tongue.  It is at the far front
    end of the left fuel rail.  It's held in place by a 10mm screw and
    is a b*tch to get at.
      (10mm short open/box end wrench and small hands)

5. Unscrew the fuel line middle mounting bracket.  It is located at the
    far side (front) of the engine, in front and slightly left, of the
    throttle housing.  It holds the brass fuel line, near the elbow
    where it turns to head back toward the alternator.  It also holds
    the bypass fuel line, and part of the wiring harness.  The mounting
    bracket is held to the support by a long (3") screw with a 4mm allen
    head.  Warning: This is a total PITA to get at, and harder to put
    back.
      (4mm allen wrench and long contortionist arms with small hands)

6. Remove the middle mounting bracket's support.  In step 5, you
    removed the bracket.  Now, remove the support to which it was
    attached.  This is done by removing the 10mm nut holding it onto
    the engine case.
      (10mm socket and extension)

7. Unbolt the fuel line T-junction mounting tongue.  It is located
    just above the alternator where the fuel line tubing branches
    toward each fuel rail.  (10mm socket)

** At this point, the fuel line assembly should be moveable.  It's still
connected to the fuel rails and fuel filter by rubber hoses, but the
brass tubing section should be free now.

** You'll now be disconnecting the fuel lines.  Inevitably, the lines
will be full of gas, and it will spill everywhere.  So, I suggest using
some rags to soak it up, and a fan to blow the fumes away.

8. Disconnect the return fuel line and bypass fuel line from the fuel
    pressure regulator.  The fuel pressure regulator is located at the
    far front end of the left fuel rail.  The 'return' fuel line goes
    from the left side of the fuel pressure regulator to the firewall
    under the engine lid hinge.  The 'bypass' fuel line goes from the
    right side of the fuel pressure regulator to the fuel pressure
    damper at the far front end of the right fuel rail.
      (15mm and 17mm open end wrenches)

9. Remove the fuel pressure regulator assembly.  In step 8, you
    disconnected the fuel lines.  Now, pull off the vacuum line from
    the top.  The whole assembly is mounted to left side of the intake
    manifold.  Remove the mounting bracket screws from the left side
    of the assembly.
      (10mm socket for the two mounting screws)

** Note: removing the assembly (bracket and fuel pressure regulator) is
easier than removing each individually.

10. Disconnect the bypass fuel line from the fuel pressure damper and
    remove it. (far front end of right fuel rail).
      (15mm or 17mm open end wrenchs, and a pair of snips to cut
       the plastic cable ties)

11. Disconnect the main fuel line assembly from the fuel filter (top),
    and from the near/back ends of the left and right fuel rails.
      (17mm open end wrenches)

** At this point, the entire fuel line assembly should be free.  It's
still trapped under the intake manifold, but it should be free to move
around.

12. Optional:  Remove the lower throttle mechanism spring.  This is
    the one located under the intake manifold.  I removed it to give
    me just that little bit of extra room.

13: Optional:  Disconnect the TDC sensor plug and move aside.  This is
    the sensor plug connector located right in front of you as you look
    at the engine above the alternator.  I removed it to give me just
    that little bit of extra freedom.

14. Remove the fuel line assembly.  Take your time and try to navigate
    it through the the maze and out the far/front end (tranny/firewall
    end) of the engine.  I don't know what else to suggest.  It just
    takes perseverence and determination.  All I can tell you is not to
    worry.  For me, the new fuel line went in much easier than the old
    one came out (YMMV).

** Everything goes back together in reverse order of the way it came
apart.  No tricks, No magic.  Just perseverence and determination.

Good Luck and Keep Porsching,
