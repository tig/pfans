Hello fellow p-fans!

I would like to whole-heartedly recommend Rod Birch, the owner of Car Audio
Innovations.  His company manufacturers the custom fitting sub-woofer
enclosures for our 911/930 cars.  You may have seen his ads in Excellence
and Panorama, his enclosure fits in the footwells of the rear seats.  Well
I ordered his enclosure and a pair of 8" Kicker subs from Rod and installed
them this weekend.  They sound absolutely great!  Rod has kindly answered
every phone call I made with questions and suggestions.  He has proven that
he knows our cars layout intimately.  The enclosure blends seamlessly with
my interior (matching carpet color, etc.) and adds that extra level of
sound needed for great music.  As I have a dual 4" exhaust it was
satisfying to drown out that rumble with some solid hitting bass.

If you are thinking of adding subs into your car, I would recommend these
custom enclosures by Rod.  Well worth it.

I am not affiliated with him or his company, just a very satisfied customer
and wanting to share a good find with the rest of you.  His phone number is
916-421-3123.


Troy

'79  930 - Petrol Blue now with great sound inside and out.
