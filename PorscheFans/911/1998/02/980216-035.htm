Thanks Ron.
I also have a history with such beasts, having adjusted the valves on my
several air cooled VW's in the past.  Damn sight easier to get to on the
VW's than the 911!
I guess what I was looking for here was some comfort level on the amount
of valve tappet noise I am getting on the engine.
One list member suggested checking them again, but I am very reluctant
to do so after many weeks of work...just want to drive it now.

	Hi William,

	For what it's worth, I go through the exact same thing when I do
a valve
	adjustment.  It MUST be making more noise than before!!  I have
also gone
	back to pull everything apart only to find that clearances are
properly
	set.  I think the clearances get tighter as you drive the car,
hence the
	quieter they become at adjustment time.  When properly adjusted,
they then
	sound loose (in comparison).  I've had plenty of other cars with
adjustable
	valves, and all exhibit that clicking sound to some extent.  It
just seems
	more noticable in the 911.

	Take care!
