    Yeah, it should... With a relay installed, the switch never sees
    high currents.

    Back in November, Bruce Hollander <bporsch1@herald.infi.net>
    posted an ad for a $30 "special custom relay" that would allow
    the fog lights to remain on with the high beams.

    I replied that -- although I don't even own a 911, so I couldn't
    test my idea -- it seemed to me that the same thing could be
    accomplished by simply removing the round 5-pin fog-light relay,
    cutting pin "30" off it, and reinstalling it.

    He didn't respond, which leads me to believe that perhaps that
    IS all there is to it.

    If you try it, let me know how it works.
