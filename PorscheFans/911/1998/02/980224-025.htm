Hi P-Fans,

I want to say thanks to everyone on the list for their responses to my
post regarding insurance for driver's ed events.  I also want to share
with you what I have found out.

The local All State and State Farm insurance agents (in Craig, northwest
Colorado) both said they would cover me, but the premium they quoted for
my three cars is approximately 40% higher than what I am currently
paying with American Family ($510 & $534 vs $366 for 6 months for just
the Porsche).

At the suggestion of someone on the list, I called Chase & Heckman.
They will cover you off the track and on the track for Driver's Ed only.
 They also have a mileage limitation of less than 2,500 or 5,000 miles
annually (you choose).  For my car, 1986 Carrera, agreed value of
$25,000, limits of 100/300/100, less than 5,000 miles annually, the
premium is $824.00/year.  Very reasonable, but here's the catch:  your
off the track deductible is $500.00 but on the track, it's $5,000.00 (or
10% of agreed value, whichever is greater).

I also called Conseco at the suggestion of another list member, but the
number has been disconnected.

Unless anybody knows of a better way, I am leaning towards switching to
Chase & Heckman for the Porsche only.  At least I will know going in
that the worse (financial) loss I will suffer is $5,000.00 should
something go wrong on the track.

Does anybody have any experiences with Chase & Heckman with regards to
processing of a claim?

Thanks again,

Al Cabrera
