If you think the T is bad, try driving  an E or S in stop-and-go traffic. These
cars really work poorly below  30 mph. These  cars like to be up in the revs,
otherwise they are a pain.

This is not a big deal. However during in-town driving, getting into  first
constantly is tedious. The shifts between 5,4,3 and 2 on twisty roads more than
makes up for first being inconvenient. After some practice, knowing what gear
you're in should be second nature. It is possible your shift linkage needs
rejuvenation or at least careful adjustment and alignment.

I agree completely. I do not think early 911s (before 1974) are useful for
stop-and-go driving.

One should have the steering/ball joints checked carefully on a 36 year old car.
However the steering is very light. One of the contemporary road tests praised this
feature saying something like "the steering feels the  same whether one is going 10
mph or 100 mph".  You may find it useful to have the car corner weighed to see of
the suspension is properly set up. It could be you do not have enough weight on the
front wheels.

I believe you should be seeing at least 20 mpg  under highway driving conditions.
15 mpg may be normal for short trips in heavy traffic. Take the car out for a 2 - 4
hour drive at 50-70 mph and carefully check mpg. You might want to use highway
mileage markers to check your odometer's accuracy.
