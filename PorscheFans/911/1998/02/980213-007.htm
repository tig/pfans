Hi folks
I posted this awhile back and got a few resopnses, but nothing major.
Since then I've seen quite a few looking for cars so I thought I'd send it
again.  Apologies for the duplication.

1979 911SC Coupe, black/tan, 135k, records from new, full leather, power
windows, sunroof, excellent A/C, 16" Fuchs with Bridgestone S02s, Carrera
tensioners, always garaged, beautiful car in great condition, runs and
drives like a 911 should.  $13,500.  call Mark Litherland 770.234.9299h or
770.448.2700w or email 911guy@ideas-inc.org.  Car is located in Atlanta.

I've had this car advertised for over a month now and have had lots of
calls about it, but only one person has actually looked at it.  He wanted
to buy it on the spot, but decided to buy a car for his wife instead.  I'm
curious about why it's generating so little *real* interest.  Anyone have
any ideas?  I realize it's priced on the high end for an SC, but the car is
truly excellent and I'm asking nowhere near what I've got in it.

Thanks for the input.
Mark
