Hi Doug.  Congrats on the new car.  I just finished putting a sound system in
my 86 Targa.  I didn't got all out or anything on it but it sounds pretty
good.  It has a couple Boston Acoustics speakers in the doors and some other
brand (I don't remember at the moment) plate style speakers on the rear deck
(the PO had these installed).  For subs I used a custom box built by Rod Birch
of Car Audio Innovations that fits in front of the rear seats, on the floor
(he just started a web site at http://bbs.uweb.ml.org/cain/default.html and
he's got an ad in Excellence).  If you want subs, I highly recommend his box. 
He'll match the carpet color of your interior too.  It looks factory.  I
didn't use a separate crossover, but the ones built in the amp I'm using.  It
won't win any of those sound competitons, but it sounds great with my favorite
backup singer ("flat 6") singing in the background.. :)  If you want to know
about my system in more detail let me know.

My 86 3.2 with 58K (66K now) scored the following on it's last CA smog check.

     At 2500 rpm     Reading
       HC ppm         0000
       CO %           0.00

     At idle
       HC ppm         0000
       C0 %           0.00

That sounds good.  I've found oil comsumption varies quite a bit from car to
car.  Mine burns hardly anything (4000 miles using about 1/3 quart) yours is
well above what Porsche considers normal (which is something like a quart
every 800 miles if I recall correctly).  I don't drive it as my daily driver
though...it's saved for those special roads.

I don't much care for 17.  I much prefer 2 line backroads with little or no
other cars.  A few of my favorites in your area are Highway 9, 236, and 35. 
The road up to the Observatory on Mount Hamilton is fun too.  There's a bunch
of nice, twisting mountain roads around here (I live north of Salinas). 
Carmel Valley road is one of my favorites also.  heh, course all the rain
we've gotten lately has washed away many parts of these roads.  Oh do I long
for those old blue skies..
  
>I am having a BLAST so far. The question is, how do 
>you STOP driving? I've seen (read) how much fun you

I seem to have the same problem.  I liked to drive before my Porsche, but now
I spend hours looking over maps for twisting roadways, and spend entire
weekends just driving.  Planning routes that run a couple hours out of the
area and loop back.  I use a laptop with a GPS system too.  You can find a
bunch of books about roads in California and other states also (try looking at
Amazon [http://www.amazon.com]).

Good luck with your Porsche...I've had mine about 8 months now and love every
minute of it.
