Greetings PFans!

Short story- I'm driving to work in my '72 ('67S motor) the other morning.
I pull out to pass a semi on a rural NC road and as I shift from 3-4 at
about 5000 rpm a loud bang is emitted from the engine followed by a
noticeable vibration and much smoke.  I ease off the road, ~1/4 mile later,
and shut the car off.  I walk around to the back and see every drop of oil
in the engine running out onto the grass.  Between 4 letter expletives and
visions of $$$, I'm hoping/praying I simply burst an oil return tube.  Such
doesn't appear to be the case.  After checking out the engine in my wrench's
parking lot, it appears that some internal component attempted to make a
hasty exit out of the bottom of the engine, near the drain plug.

So, that said, I'm faced with a dilemma that I hope you fellow Pfanatics can
help with.  Do I replace the engine (upgrade of course) and continue with my
restoration or do I part it out (or sell it as is) and sell my daily driver
('90 Limited Ed. 5.0/5spd Mustang Conv't) and take the money and buy a newer
911 in much better overall condition.  My '72 is in reasonable overall
condition, although it does have some nasty rust damage (inside front fender
on the door jamb, along the bottoms of the doors and inside the engine
compartment on the rear dash).  It'd really take a disassembly and a
welder's touch,  during which I'm sure to find more rust, to prep it for a
complete paint job which it really needs.  So, where is my money best spent?
Is the '72 worth the $5k for an engine plus the $3-5k (optimistic) probably
needed to complete the restoration?  Or, should I start to look around for a
mid 80's Carrera, which is all I'd be able to afford?

Any advice (or sympathy) would be greatly appreciated!!!  My wife isn't
nearly as understanding about my Pfanatiscm as some of the ladies who have
recently posted.  If I can just find a way to justify (to her) that '82
Widebody w/ 65k miles that I saw today, I may not even miss my current
vehicles... :-)

Sorry for the bandwidth, but life just got a bit sour without my 911.

Thanks in advance!
