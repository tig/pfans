hi P-fans

 Well, I finally got my new clutch pedal and cable installed. I have 
driven the car for a short distance to check it out and everything seems 
ok. I do have a question however. While installing the new pedal, I 
noticed that the clutch assist spring was missing(never installed?). 
What is the best way to install the spring, doesn't seem to fit anyway I 
try. The car was without it for as long as I have owned it, and who 
knows how long before that.
 Well thanks for reading this installment. Thanks to all the P-fans that 
have helped this new 911 owner and E-mailed me with suggestions, they 
all helped.
