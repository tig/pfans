Steven Gilbert's reply to this thread was good, but Aldo responded with
bombs on target. I Couldn't agree more with Aldo on the paint scratch
problem. This has got to be my pet peeve, hence my input, for what it is
worth.  From very frustrating experiences (Law suit over paint on a Dino
that was a 7K paint job gone sideways, and other disapointments in my
younger days) You must find an outfit that knows the cars, and if
possible does factory contract work. We are lucky here in Charleston
that Automotive Specialties, who does contract work for the PDI center
is able and willing to do work on our cars. My previous 911 (new at the
time) had acid rain, and stuff from sitting outside at the dealers. They
completely dismantled the car, prior to painting (all but one fender and
one door). When done I believe it to be better than the factory. The PDI
center inspected and and said the same. I am one hell of a picky person,
like all of us about our cars, and they understand that at Automotive
Specialties. My new Boxster also had some kind of overspray on it
(couldn't see it, only feel it), and the area tech rep for Porsche sent
it to him to get polished out.  Suberb job there too.  The PDI center
sends him their vehicles that get dented and dinged and worse. They have
been doing this work for a number of years, and the owner himself worked
at the PDI center before branching out for himself. He is the only one
who does the Porsches.The moral is: Take it to the right place, and you
will get the "right" job. From big problems to little ones, it pays to
seek out the true specialist, who understands what we want, and can DO
the work!  I would/and have had my car trailered to a shop before I
would even entertain the idea of taking it to less than an experienced,
referred, body shop.  As long as the guy who refers you, and you and the
body shop understand the same language it should turn out right.  I have
that, and it is a real comfort, from a tiny scratch to major work, have
it done right the first time! If you can't afford it, save your money
for the repairs until you can. Labor here runs cheaper than most places,
being about $50.00 an hour for the type of work Automotive Specialist
and the like do, down to $40.00 for the average good body shop (where I
wouldn't take my car).  That's not a bad spread for getting the best! 

Wish I could say the same for mechanical work.  My guy left town, and
now I have to trailer the car to North Carolina (the Dino, thankfully
not the 911).
