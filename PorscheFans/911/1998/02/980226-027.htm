I read with interest yesterday's brief post concerning the claim that
synthetic oil had damaged the gaskets/seals in an "older" porsche.  Normally
such a post would have been dismissed by me  as the rationale given by a
mechanic eager to do some expensive engine work.  

However, the post triggered my recollection of numerous earlier posts in
which it was repeatedly observed that the synthetic oils had caused an
increase in oil leaks, prompting at least several owners to switch back to
cnventional oil thereby reducing the amount of oil leakage.

Although none of the posts contained any explanation as to the reasons for
the different reactions within the engine to the synthetic oil, one might
speculate as to whether use of the synthetics -- while perhaps improving
wear characteristics of metal surfaces -- nonetheless has less positive
effects on other engine internals.  As oil is the life-blood of the air
cooled 911 engine, and I have switched to Mobil 1 in a 78 Sc for the last
30K miles, I would be interested in any comments from the list.
