So I finally got some free time to go into the garage and play with my 914-6
project.  My attention wandered over to the 911 engine sitting on a dolly
in the corner of the garage.  I was planning to put in on a stand sometime
soon, and clean it up.  It was represented to me as a '73.5 2.4 CIS when
I picked it up.  The seller gave me a receipt showing the engine rebuild
costs, and the engine definitely has a CIS system.  So I took his word as such,
and put it in a corner, sure I was going to drop it into the car in a couple
of weeks.

Fast forward two years.  As you might have guessed, I'm finally getting around
to dropping in the engine now.  I was ready to pop off the flywheel in preparation
for mounting it on a stand when I noticed one of the holes to attach the
tranny looked funny.  Sure enough, it's stripped out.  There are some threads
down deep, but effectively, it is REALLY stripped out.  So I figure I have the
option of tapping it out for a larger bolt, or using a helicoil or timesert.
Tapping out to a larger size I can do; helicoil I think I can do; timesert I
should probably take to a shop.  It seems to me that this is a pretty important
thread, so I'd like to make the strongest possible fix.  Which option would be
the wisest?  The stripped hole is the upper left one, as your facing the flywheel,
in case that makes any difference.

Another thing too that I noticed.  I had glanced at the case a while back to
look at the case number, thinking about possible mods.  I thought I saw a 5R;
I let it pass.  On closer inspection this evening, I saw 901.105.111.0R on the
case (between the valve covers).  What the heck is this case?  In Bruce A.'s
book, I see the early engines had a 901.101.101.01 number, going up to a 
901.101.101.7R (which was what I was hoping for).  I don't see how this engine
case fits into the sequence.  It strikes me as odd that someone would go through
a lot of trouble to build up a 2.4 CIS motor in particular, when there are so
many other options to choose from when building a motor.  Whoever had it last
did apparently seem to care a bit about it; though dirty/oily, it does have
turbo valve covers and Carrera tensioners.  So I'm puzzled as to the origin of
this engine, and it's suitability for tweaking.  If anyone can help me figure
out how to i.d. what displacement/configuration this engine originally came in,
I'd really appreciate it!

That's all the questions for now; more to come as I dig in! =8^)

TIA,
Mike
