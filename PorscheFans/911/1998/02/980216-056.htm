  "Some magazine articles" as you mention is not a sound
reason to
discount the 89-94 model 911's. Let me quote the "orphan"
reference
that is in the February  edition of EXCELLENCE magazine, by
Bruce Anderson:

"The Carrera 2 is a nice car, and is technologically
advanced when compared to older 911s.  The 993 that replaced
it, however, is so much better that I feel the 964 cars may
become orphans in the future, with people buying either the
"classic" 911s or the 993-and-newer models."

The authors point,  I believe, is if a buyer was looking for
a newer 911,  a 993 is preferred to a late model 964, and
the 87-89 Carreras would be sought by those seeking an older
911. This could effect resale prices and it appears that the
87-89 cars (good condition) have bottomed out in price,
while the later model 964's have a way to go.  Remember that
the 964 was more expensive car than the 993 (and Carrera),
and market forces will  not keep the 964 at resale values as
high as Carreras and 993s in percentage terms.  EXCELLENCE
also listed used 964 prices quite higher than Carreras.
(1990 C2 24,819 - 33,225).  I believe that for quite some
time to come, the 964 will fill the price gap between the
993's and 87-89 911s. (And I doubt Mr. Anderson would
disagree.)

As for a "quantum leap" between the 964 and 993, the 964 is
80% newer than the Carrera, and the 993 is very similar
mechanically to the 964 except for body and rear suspension
(and intake/exhaust improvements, hydraulic valve
adjusters).

My point is DRIVE a Carrera and C2/C4 before making a
decision.     If
you drive a C2 then jump into a Carrera, you might be
disappointed with the
'classic'.  And if you can find a 993 for the price of a
964, buy it (or tell me about it.)

8K.
