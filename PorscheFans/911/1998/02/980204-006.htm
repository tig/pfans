My 1981 911SC experiences a fast Idle of around 2000 RPM even after
it should be fully warmed up 15 to 20 Minutes of highway driving.
This only occurs during the winter in New Jersey when the temp is
40 or below.  All fuel pressures have been checked and are within
tolerance.  The symptom seems to point to the Auxiliary Air
Regulator.  I removed, cleaned and tested the Regulator with the
following observations:

When cold after sitting in ice water for about 20 minutes, the valve 
was open about 2/3 of the way.

At room temperature, it was open about 1/4 of the way.

After 10 to 15 minutes of 12 volts applied to electrical connection, 
it was almost closed all of the way.  My guess would be about 1/16" 
from being fully closed.

After heating with a hair dryer for several minutes, the results were 
the same as with electricity applied.

Basically, I could not cause the valve to fully close.

My question is:  Is this normal, or should the valve close completely 
in the warm engine condition?  Do I need to replace the Auxiliary 
Air Regulator (another $200).

My SC has 49K miles and has had a new fuel pump and accumulator 
installed last summer to correct lack of residual fuel pressure 
problem.  Car runs great.
