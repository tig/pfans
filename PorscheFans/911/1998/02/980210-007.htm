This sounds like a great deal. The price is there and the history/warranty
is a sweetheart deal.

Peter--
Not to sound impertinent, but do you really want a 911? This car is the
quintessential stock sports car--period. It is the closest thing you can
get to the professional track (talking european here) while spending less
than the mortgage on a castle. I have known people who have confused the
911 with Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, etc.. The 911 has luxury features but they
are far, far from that class of car. My wife drives a Toyota Avalon. When I
want luxury, reliability, soft quiet ride, I take her car. When I want to
Walter Mitty LeMans or the Targa Florio (my drive to work is twisty-turny),
I take the Porsche.
