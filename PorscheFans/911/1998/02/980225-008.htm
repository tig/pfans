I have the I/O Port camera mount in my car.  It works very well, even with
my camcorder with no stabilization enhancement.  With my uncle's identical
camera, with stabilization enhancement, it is perfect.  I even used it at
Bridgehampton.  Anybody whose driven on that track knows how rough it is. 
I was surprised the camera even stayed mounted.
