Peter:

I feel your pain and.....

Yes you want it!

What's holding you back is the streak of reasonable-ness that lives in most of
us. The car will likely be everything you dream it will, however it costs a
LOT, insurance costs a LOT (if you drive it) and it has absolutely no practical
value.

It took me over a month to pull the trigger on a 93 C2 for $33K. I drove both
myself, my wife and the previous owner crazy (4 visit/test drives). It was my
first 911, which does not help either. I payed cash (no loan) which made the
decision that much more scary.

I read 5 or 6 thick books, looked all over the internet, subscribed to this
newsletter (which is more scary than anything with all the problems constantly
discussed) went and drove many cars and flopped back and forth on my decision
sometimes a couple of times in a given hour! Sometimes stayed up at night
thinking about it. I was out on a limb and had NO support from anyone (except
the seller) to buy it. Finally, it was a heated argument with the wife over the
car that spurned me to go buy it....you know, the be a man deal.

Now, I have the car, it's perfect, and I like it more than any automobile I
have ever been in! It's totally pampered, sitting the garage with a quilt over
it to keep the damn cat off of it and it never goes out when it's wet. I always
get a little rush when I drive it and always look forward to going anywhere in
it.

So...

1) Make SURE the car is mechanically sound using the best 3-rd party pCAR folks
you can find.
2) Buy the damn thing, you will love it. If not, you can sell it.
