For what it is worth here is my experience with Performance.  The muffler I
ordered from them was not shipped out until two days after I had ordered
it.  I was assured by the salesperson at the time of purchase that I would
have the muffler in time to put my car back together on the week-end, but
alas it was not to be as UPS does not deliver on the week-ends, and because
Performance did not send the package out until two days later I had to wait
another week.  

When the muffler arrived a yellow sticker from Performance was stuck to the
packing box.  It stated something to the effect that I was to open the box
and inspect the goods prior to signing for the goods, for once I had
signed, Performance would not be liable for damaged goods.  I was told by
UPS, the carrier used by Performance, that they have a conflicting policy.
Their policy prohibits anyone from opening a package until it is signed
for. So, my choice was to not sign for my late muffler, send it back, get a
credit, and wait even longer to get my car together or sign for the muffler
and hope that it wasn't damaged, or if it was, that Performance would
disregard the liability disclaimer as written on the yellow sticker stuck
to the box and recognize the conflict between their policy and that of
their chosen carrier.  Being a gambler at heart, I signed for the muffler
and luckily it wasn't damaged.  I suppose if the muffler was damaged, at
best I would have had an annoying, time consuming problem on my hands.  At
worst I'd have been out about $300.  In today's fast paced world time is
the most precious commodity on Earth and I don't even want to risk wasting
any of mine dealing with a vendor that doesn't recognize that.

Lastly their is the issue of price.  On the few purchases in which I have
actually comparison shopped, I have found that parts can be purchased
significantly cheaper from places other than Performance and Automotion.
When I purchased a new SSI heat exchanger Performance and Automotion wanted
between $499 and $545 for a heat exchanger.  I ultimately purchased mine
from a place in New York called PAR for $399. Automotion lists a 930 tie
rod kit for $188, with CA tax I would have paid about $205 for it.  I
purchased a 930 tie rod kit from PAR for $125 including shipping.  I must
admit the folks at Automotion are great.  They are knowledgable, friendly,
and they bend over backwards for you.  I am lucky in that they are just
down the street from me so I buy lots of little things there, but still, I
can't pay nearly 50% more, as would have been the case with my 930 tie rod
kit, for parts, so if I need to buy an expensive part I shop around.  In
short, it doesn't even make sense for anyone in California to buy big
ticket items from places like Automotion or Performance because you have to
pay the higher prices and California sales tax.  

Has anyone had a good or bad experience with a place called Doc and Cy's?
Their prices seem to be pretty good and their catalog indicates they offer
technical advice as well.  This sounds like a pretty good combination.
