I wrote following to this list on March 22nd 1997:

Hi John,

Interesting question!
I replaced mine with an universal O2 sensor, about 35USD, and have =

frankly no idea if it is working properly or not. My old one was bad, =

but it was because I had other problems that I corrected, hence I =

can't compare before / after changing it. I don't think this qualify as
a test, but it passed the Florida "smog check".   =

The generic O2 sensor I bought for my -85 911 even had the same =

shape, so I could use the original shield. Perfect fit.

Anyhow I bought also a generic 4-wire O2 sensor for my SO =

Dodge Caravan after the "computer" told the old one was bad.
The "computer" accepted this generic O2 sensor.

To my understanding an O2 sensor is just an O2 sensor, nothing
else. Porsche is using Bosch sensors and these should also be
available as generic versions, witch mean You have to use the
old plug. I just couldn't find then a Bosch 3-wire sensor.

You can pretty easily check the O2 sensor, stuff needed:
- High impedance (10Mohm) digital multimeter that is capable
  of measuring millivolts DC, (below 1V). Using a low impedance
  meter might (will) destroy the O2 sensor.
- Propane torch
- Pliers

How it is done:
- Connect the multimeter to sensor, one lead to the output lead of
  O2 sensor. My -85 use a 3-wire sensor, there is two plugs, one =

  2-wire for the heating and one single wire for output.
  The other lead to sensor body, eg. ground.
- Hold the O2 sensor with pliers and heat the tip so it turn "red"
- Observe the multimeter reading, if the reading is somewhere above
  600millivolts and changes quickly when the flame is moved over =

  the tip Your sensor should be OK. Voltage should change quickly.

If Your O2 sensor has high miles, propably You should change it,
it is one of those parts that fade away.

I have been told that normal table salt will destroy the O2 sensor, =

so have the chips after You're done.  =


Don't forget the O2 sensor safe anti-seize!

Just a side note, You can check the cat converter by measuring the
temp before and after, if after higher, about 100F, if I remember right,
the cat is working.

I'm writing these from my memory and because of this, proceed with
extreme caution.

PS. I used Tomco 11014 generic 3-wire sensor.
