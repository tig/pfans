Last night I got my 77 911S  Targa 2.7 Sportomatic back from three months at
the dealer.  Everything works fine now.  The shifting problem has been solved.
More on that some othre time.  

Two things though.  When I started the car the second time, the key broke off
in my hand so it was back to the dealer.  After getting a new key (i was able
to pull out the broken part myself) I noticed  that it would turn clockwise
very easily but not "off" -- counterclockwise.  What is going on here?  Should
I squirt wd40 in the lock mechanism?

Help!  I don't want to wreck anything. 

Second, when I arrived at my next destination I pulled on the door handle and
something came loose.  I was late for a meeting and it was dark so I didn't
have a chance to check it out.  When I got Home, still dark, I noticed there
is a lever -- rod that is loose.  How easy is it to re-attach ?

Your help would be appreciated.   

Also, someone said there was a tech bulletin on adjusting the Targa top.  This
my third Targa and this one is way noiser that the others.  It starts already
at 50 MPH and gets way too loud to hear the radio or even the engine at 65.  

the PO had installed a rectangular rubber foam strip along the leading edge of
the fron factory seal.  I took this out so the top could sit down a bit lower
but it did not help.  Pulling down in the middle of the top at the front also
does no good.  

Help!!

Thanks to all who have answered my questions on the 7X16 rear Fuches.  Most
advice says they won't work.  

TIA,  Walt, waltrains@aol.com

 77-911S Targa,  Sportomatic finally shifting, Gold/Black, ugly discolored and
