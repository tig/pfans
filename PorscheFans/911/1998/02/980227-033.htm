I have the euro headlights on my 1975 911S.  (Bosch H1's?).  I am trying to
figure out how to adjust the high beams vertically.
Each glass lens has 4 sets of arrows and letters on it, next to each of the
4 adjusting screws.  The two top arrows on each lens point up and down, so I
assume the top screws adjust the high and low beams vertically.  On each
lens the top passenger side arrow has an "F" next to it, and the top driver
side vertical arrow has a "F" next to it.  

The bottom screws have horizontal arrows next to them.  The bottom passenger
side arrow on each lens has an "A" next to it and the bottom driver side
arrow has a "F" next to it.  I assume these bottom screws adjust both high
and low beams horizontally?

Can anyone help me with this?  The Haynes manual has a photo and a legend
but doesn't say which does what.  The Clymer manual, and I'm told, the
factory service manual don't explain the Euro lights at all.

Thanks much, Randy
