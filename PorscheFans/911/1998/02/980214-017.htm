Re:hood scratches on new car, the Wall Street Journal had a article on 
Jan. 5th relating the displeasure experienced by Eckhard Pfeiffer, CEO of 
Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston when he discovered his new 
all-wheel-drive Porsche turbo received a scratch on its underside at the 
hands of the dealership.  He demanded a new car; he was told the waiting 
list was two years.

Pfeiffer called the Porsche CEO in Stuttgart to voice his complaint.  
Three days later. the Houston dealer was notified by Porsche HQ that a 
new car for Mr. Pfeiffer was on its way.

I guess it helps to know the language.
