I have to agree with Kevin.  Drive a variety of 911's and decide.  I
recently did and chose the 964 as the best car hands down.  Just as the
Carrera is better in most ways than the SC's, the C2/C4's are better in
most ways than Carrera's and 993's are better than 964's.  I don't see how
very many people could choose a Carrera over a 964 for the same price.  The
964 has more HP, more torque, better brakes, better aerodynamics, looks?,
better handling, reasonable heat and A/C, ABS, is quieter and will leave
the old model in the dust on the track (given stock cars with similar
drivers of course).  The problems with the clutch and dual distributor have
been retrofitted by now, just as the tensioner have been upgraded on old
911's.  I still like the rule, buy the newest 911 you can afford, but they
are just toys so buy whatever car you like and don't worry about one writer
says about resale value.  I am very sure that I will be able to sell my C4
for at least what I paid for it in a few years and if not, who cares I LOVE
MY NEW CAR!

Just my opinion!

Jad
