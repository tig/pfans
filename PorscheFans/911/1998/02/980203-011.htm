Back on the 3rd [of October], Mark posted a message about rewiring an SC
so that the fog lights can be used with only the parking lights on
rather than requiring the head lights to be on. This is something that I
wanted to do, but I saw that his instructions didn't apply to my
Carrera. So, I broke out the wiring diagram and figured it out for
myself. Here is how I did it.

OK, Regardez vous the fuse block under the bonnet (in the trunk). The
wiring diagram claims that the fog light relay is connected to fuse 20.
Look for the gray wire coming into this fuse from underneath. Hmmm, on
my car there was no wire connected underneath fuse 20. Don't be confused
by the gray wires on the top of fuse 20; those are power source, not
power load. Leave them alone. I found the gray wire going into the
bottom of fuse 17. Now loosen the set screw and remove said gray wire.
If you are removing the gray wire from under fuse 17, make sure the
other wire stays put. Tighten the set screw. Now loosen the screw on the
bottom of fuse 19 and insert the gray wire into that position (18 and 19
are the parking light fuses). Tighten the screw and you are done.

Most manuals would have a standard disclaimer to disconnect the battery
before attempting something like this. I didn't want to have to reset my
radio, alarm, and clock, so I left the battery alone. I did probe the
fuse block with my voltmeter and discovered that most fuses, including
all of those discussed here, don't have power to them when the ignition
is off. If in doubt, have your mechanic do this.

Hey, Alan Caldwell, if you are reading this, this topic would make a
nifty tech tip article (extended to cover all applicable models and
years)! Permission to use hereby granted. I have already disconnected
the upshift indicator thanks to your helpful recent article.

Happy Porsching!
