Wayne,

As I am in the process of redoing a headliner in a '77 911S Coupe, I
have
come to appreciate the problem you refer to, as well as the high cost of

replacing seals in general.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised
to
learn that Porsche dealership prices are not always higher than the
aftermarket.  Specific examples (from Valley Motors in Baltimore, MD)
include front windshield seal ($50), front windshield trim ($56/side),
and rear quarter glass fixed (on-body) seals ($31).  In some cases, the
cost is lower than that advertised in Automotion or Performance Products

catalogs (part numbers are the same).

On the other hand, they want $50/each for door seals and $108 for the
rear windshield seal (still trying to verify the correct part number on
this one), considerably higher than the aftermarket.  Note that these
prices include a 10% discount for PCA membership.

For my money, I will certainly buy Porsche parts where the cost is
comparable.  In addition, I think one has to consider the 'criticality'
factor: I only want to do this once, and where potential seal failure
or incompatibility is a significant risk, or where the seal protects
important/expensive components, a relatively minor price difference is
not worth worrying about (short-term pain, long-term gain).  Check with
your dealer on pricing and don't forget to ask about PCA discounts.

Good luck,

Robert Herbert
