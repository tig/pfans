I am looking to purchase a 911 that is 2000 miles away.  So, it is important
to have done all my homework.  I've had a local garage look at the car, and
for the most part it looks okay.

Its a 83 cab, only 56K miles, $16000.  Seems like the car has been titled
about 7 times, and the last two times, the mileage showed "exempt", but
through 1986, it had 36000 miles on it.  The dashboard shows heat fatigue from
Texas weather, as well as the back plastic window.

My questions:
- 56000 miles on a 1983, is this believable, when it had 36000 miles on it in
86.

- any concern about the "exempt" status where mileage belongs on the title

- the leak test was 5% on cylinder 1; "0" on 2-6 ( now would YOU believe that)

- the car has been painted; was red; now black.  You can tell because the red
shows through the "nicks"

- seems like the car hasn't been driven much.  When the leak test was done,
they saw the plugs were old, and changed them.  When I asked if they had
changed the oil, they said no.  If it isn't being driven, I'd think an oil
change imperative.  What would you think about buying a car that seems to have
had the minimum of service.

I've only seen the pictures, looked at the title details, and talked to the
local garage.  I'm on-my-own for this purchase.  My concern may be the lack of
service since 1986.... worst than driven hard, sounds like driven not.  Good
things its not a turbo.

So, help a lady out.... what do you think?
