Definately have a Porsche mech check it out. Pay particular attention to
valve noise, leak-down results, and compression check. See
http://www.kindel.com/Porsche/valves.asp for why.

> I need to tap the wisdom of the members of the 911 list, if I may.

> The situation:
> 
> PO has a 1988 Porsche 911 Coupe, non turbo, guards red, five speed 220
> hp with leather and alarm system.  Second owner with 75000 miles on the
> odometer.  The machine has factory tail with a/c, p/s, p/w, and power
> sun roof.  Exterior and interior appear very good to excellent.
> Undercoating looks very good.  Engine compartment clean but some minor
> oil in the valve cover area underneath.
> 
> I looked at the machine yesterday.  PO had the car parked on concrete
> drive.  I did not see any indication of oil leaking on the concrete.  PO
> will permit me to have the car checked out by a mechanic.
> 
> PO is asking $28,000 and change for the car.  I checked the various
> lists on the internet and noted 1988s are listed from 21,000 to 27,500
> for the coupe non turbo model.  The blue book retail for my zip code on
> this model as equipped is $27,300.
> 
> Questions:
>     1.  Are there any particular things to watch out for in the 1988
> model?
>     2.  What would be a good offer for this machine?
>     3.  Reliability  of the 1988 model year?
> 
> Thanks in advance.
