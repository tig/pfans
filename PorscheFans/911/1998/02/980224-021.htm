Hi Bill,

I see we're still in the midst of it....

>Could somebody please clarify the procedure for cam timing for me please
>in reference to these couple of questions:
>
>1)  Do I need to make two full rotations of the crankcase pulley
>to determine the total lift distance?

Yes, sort of.  In a four cycle engine, the crank goes around twice for a
complete engine cycle.  Each piston has to go up and down twice.
Meanwhile, the the cam goes around only once, lifting each exhaust valve
and each intake valve only once, first for intake, then for exhaust.  Cam
timing adjusts the valves for the right amount of lift at the right point.
Usual practice is to adjust the #1 and #4 intake valve for a specified lift
at what's called TDC overlap, the point where the intake valve is just
opening, and the exhaust valve is just closing.  This only occurs once for
each cam rotation, or, in terms of crank rotation, only once for two crank
rotations.  You really ought to think this through, because it will help
immensely in understanding what's going on and therefore insuring that you
get the whole procedure correct.  It's a critical adjustment, and it
**has** to be right.

>2) How in the hell do you keep the spring measuring gage

Actually, the valve goes straight up and down, not in an arc. The rocker
arm moves in an arc, not the valve.  Put the gauge on the valve, not the
rocker.
It's convenient to make a small barcket that will hold your gauge and bolt
to a convenient nearby stud.

They say it does, but I don't see why.  I simply tighten it a little.

I can never remember, and am too lazy to figure it out.  I just move the
pin a hole or two in one direction and see what happens.  It takes a second.

>5) Several sources (ie books) say you can just move the
>cam shaft to get the right lift required- how? and at
>what location of the engine do you move the cam (TDC?)?

That's really what you're doing, but they might be referring to a slightly
altered procedure where you would could first set the crank to TDC and then
move the cam to get the correct TDC overlap lift spec (the same one as you
would use doing it the conventional way), at which point you would mount
the cam sprocket.  Six of one, half a dozen of the other. In the end you'll
have to go through a few cycles to check the adjustment, and I guarantee
you'll have to make more than one adjustment, so you'll wind up rotating
the crank anyway.

>6) Finally with timing chains with master links, the closed
>end of the master link points in the direction of engine run
>rotation right?? I want to sleep at night on this one...

Right.  If you're assembling the chain yourself, you need to worry about
this, and if you're intalling an already assembled one it's wise to check.
As obvious as this sounds, make sure you install the chains with the link
facing you, not on the inside of the chain where getting at it, if you need
to, will be really hard.

Have fun.
