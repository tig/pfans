	I had the misfortune of realizing that someone clipped my rear
bumper on my car over the Valentine's day weekend (and i thought it was
just dirt!).  It looks like the bumper has some white paint on it and it
has a couple of circular spots where the paint is gone and it looks like
it went a bit into the plastic of the bumper.  I dropped the car off at
Ray Catena's Porsche dealership in Edison, New Jersey to have it repaired.
The estimate was about $820.  I'm concerned that it's a bit high, but what
I'm really concerned about is the quality of the repair.  I _really_ want
the color to match.  They are supposed to be sanding the bumper down,
bonding it and repainting.  The car is Ocean Blue Metallic.  Has anyone
had any work done through them?  I still have time to pull the car out of
there, if people have poor opinions of their work.  The damage isn't
serious at all, it's all just cosmetic damage.  Look as though someone
pulled in a bit too close to my car.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
BTW, I live in Manhattan, so if anyone knows of a good shop in the NY/NJ
area with reasonable rates, I'd really appreciate the info.
