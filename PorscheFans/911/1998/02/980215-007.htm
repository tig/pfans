	I know of many horror stories from experienced and inexperienced people
towing cars on open and enclosed trailers.You would be suprised how many
incidents occur but people's egos wont alow them to admit it.

	Biggest faults and dangers:
	1. Swaying incontrollably leading to jacknife and wreck. 
	2. Braking setup for electric and hydraulic brakes. Causes long or
erractic                  braking distances
	3. other idiot drivers and miscellaneous.

	Swaying is the most dangerous and uncontrollable event that one must
avoid. I do not have all the answers- perhaps some discussion on this topic
should occur because when it happens- one almost 100% of the time wrecks
the trailer and car and even the tow vehicle. I have personally experienced
this and have several friends that have experienced total losses and
serious injury as a result of swaying.

	 "Swaying" I define as the trailer w/ car swaying back and forth with
increasing momentum leading to complete loss of control of Tow vehicle car/
trailer and etc.It is impossible to drive out of and/or correct this
situation. UHUAL has a sticker on their rentals that advise how to minimize
risk of SWAYING occuring and what not to do when it happens in a mild
situation

 To minimize I suggest:
	1. Place/drive car upfront on trailer as far as possible. Your goal is
10-15% tongue/hitch weight. This load minimizes lift on tow vehicles rear
wheels and potential porpoising and bouncing that I believe causes swaying.
On my 993 I drive the car up as far as possible and have wheel chocks
bolted on. On a 944 you may not have to go as far, front engine bias, but
err on the side of conseratism. Some 911 owners back the cars onto the
trailer to really get weight on the tongue.This what UHAUL suggests with 
rear/mid engine cars.
	2.Never get cocky, aggressive, and acclimated to driving too fast while
towing- especially in the RAIN and when its WINDY. I know people with great
towing rigs that are well maintained and have alot of trailering time that
have suffered huge writeoffs and injury. I had a tandem tractor trailer in
the rain cause my big spin and minor wreck while I was doing 50-55mph. 1995
Grand Cherokee  with open trailer and 993RS. Dougherty automotive had a
swaying event in the dry by wind in which and Suburban with 24' enclosed
trailer swayed across 3 lanes. A customer with a Dually lost a trailer with
Corvette ZR1 when it went into the center grass and rolled down the
enbankment into oncoming traffic.Many Porsche guys trailering, that have'nt
been bitten, make a track event of getting to/from the track. 
	3. Install antisway controll bars on hitch, professionally  inspect the
trailer and ADJUST trailer brake bias regularly. Cheap insurance that pays.
 Install heavy duty springs and shocks in your tow vehicle help if not
already equiped. For example JEEP has $35 each HD springs the Grand
Cherokee  with HD Bilstein shocks at $199 set.
	4. When driving be extra observant of other snapperhead car drivers and
potential problems way ahead up the road. IE that feeble minivan that cant
wait and tries to cross the road. Remember you probably have  5000-
10000lbs behind you.
	5. Bigger tow vehicles with longer wheel bases have advantages. Light
trailers have advantages as well. Beware of the SUV dealer that says the
small ISUZU Rodeo or Jimmy is capable of pulling and enclosed trailer even
if the literature shows that it can pull the weight. In addition, beware or
the Trailer dealer that says that your SUV can pull the big enclsed
trailer- the pulling power and rating may agree but it may not FEEL go when
driving. Ask if you need a longer wheelbased vehicle like a
Tahoe/Suburban/Expedition etc. 

IF you follow the advice of your trailer mfg, maintain the trailer well, go
at a reaonable pace and have adequate tongue weight. You should be
allright.
