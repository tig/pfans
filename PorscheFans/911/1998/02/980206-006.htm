What a neat topic! Insurance at DEW used to be more or less 
automatic, as Ted pointed out there were few exclusions in the old 
policies.  Now, policies have exclusions for speed events, and,
preparation for speed events.  On the surface of it, Driver's Ed is 
neither in most peoples views. That was the accepted view until last 
year when a couple guys crashed at DEW and claimed. Both were Club 
Racers and, there was a Club race at the same track a week later.

Were they preparing for a speed event?  How about the fact that one 
of the pre-requisites for a PCA Club racing license is participation 
in a certain number of DEWs?

As you can see things got sticky real fast. In our region, we warn 
drivers in writing when they register that they should check with 
their insurance company because it is possible that they are not 
covered. PCA and the track do not carry insurance to cover repairs to 
damaged cars either.

Now to the good news, I'm insured with CHUBB and they gave me a 
letter covering me during Driver's Ed.  I'm told that other Insurance 
Carriers do likewise, in fact last year, one of our locals got a 
similar letter from All State (that surprised me).   I suspect that 
this varies from one local office to another. Still, given that the 
two cases in the North East I referred to are in litigation, I advise 
caution. 

I am quite worried about what will happen in the aftermath of the 
litigation. The insurance companies interviewed club members who 
referred to DEW as "racing".  The obtained videos of DEW which 
clearly showed racing cars, driven by guys in racing suits at high 
speeds on a race track.  There is an old legal maxim "if it walks 
like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck no matter what 
you call it."

When I obtained my (free) DEW coverage I was asked if my car was 
street legal.  I think that was a hint <grin>. 

I expect PCA is busy trying to figure out how to make a clear 
distinction between racing and driver's ed.  Insurance companies are 
forcing their hand.
