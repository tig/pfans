I just finished rebuilding my front calipers.  It took me all day, as this
was my first attempt at any brake work on my car and I went pretty slow.  I
used air to get the pistons out.

What I did was put a 3/4" plate of wood between the pistons (fits perfectly
in the caliper body).  Then I used my air blower gun with a piece of rubber
tubing attached.  I had to crank the pressure up to about 170psi to move one
of the pistons.  Mine seemed pretty bad.

What usually happened was that one side came out first without even budging
the other side.  I left both in place and kept hitting it with air, then
compressing the stuck one, then hitting it with air, etc.  Kept doing this
until it loosened up.  I even used some penetrating oil to help.

It took me quite a while.  Next time I am going to get a fitting that will
screw into where the brake line attaches and attach it right to my air gun.
Then I will get the full pressure without air leaking around the rubber
tubing.

This process took the longest by far of the whole job.  I kept thinking that
I'm glad I don't have four or six piston calipers!!
