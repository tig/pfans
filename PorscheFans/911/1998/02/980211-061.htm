You will want the opinion of someone who drives every day in the snow,
not just a skier, like myself, but darnit I like Porshes in the snow. I
like the handling and the fast warm up of the air-cooled heater. 

A lot depends on the snow (how much and what kind), but the 911 has some
things in its favor. All else being equal, the rear engine layout is
best for climbing hills (positive weight transfer). The C2 owners manual
suggests narrow wheels and snow tires (205s all around in that case.
Maybe 185s on the SC?). They give you more bite and room for chains if
all else fails. Just drive prudently in the dry. Low clearance is what
would worry me most, but I assume you will be in powder snow, which is
easier to "plow". 

In the 914 with 185s we used to climb a steeper hill than that to our
cabin in as much as a foot of fresh powder with no problem. Our new C2
has way too wide snow tires (225 in the rear) but still went out and
played with the 4x4s after the last snow here.

Snowshoes? :-) Seriously, it can drastically understeer uphill,
especially on steep switch-backs. Be careful there and learn to transfer
weight to the front by lifting or braking (I said uphill, guys).
