PFans:

I have a crack in my Ruf front spoiler which is made
from a polyurethane-like material, it is flexible and it is not
fiberglass.
Does anyone have any recommendations for good adhesives,
epoxies or other means of fixing it?  I've tried a fiberglass patch
from behind but it didn't hold.  3M products?
Since track season is coming up quickly, I need to install
my front cooler and would like to fix this while the spoiler is all
apart.

Thanks in advance,
