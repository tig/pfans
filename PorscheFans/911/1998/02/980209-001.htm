When my similar "rattle" started, it turned out a chain tensioner had
collapsed on one side and the chain was rattling.  I was ready to send
it in for big buck repairs (hydraulic tensioner update) at the local
Porsche expert's shop when a friend talked me into rebuilding the bad
tensioner.  Well, the dealer had the $18 rebuild kit and 4 hours later
my rattle was fixed.  It really was very simple.  

If this is your problem, I would not drive the car with the rattle.  I
think some cars have a plastic chain ramp that can be damaged with a
loose chain; and of course you can ruin the motor if that loose chain
introduces motor parts to one another which are not intended to ever
meet.

PS: I suppose that if you have one bad tensioner, and the tensioners are
very old, then both tensioners should be rebuilt/replaced.

Good luck.

Shawn,

Perhaps you have a chain tensioner beginning to fail.   Get this checked
out ASAP!!
