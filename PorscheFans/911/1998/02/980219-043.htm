Having recently moved to Minneapolis from Seattle, where I was bitten
viciously by the P-bug, I can recommend several great mechanics in your
area.  If you live on the Eastside, Henry Luft at B&H Motorsports in
Redmond can help you out with your Porsche whether its a fire breathing
GT2 pca racer like his(see pictures of it at the GT Racing website) or
your daily driver.  Another good shop on the Eastside is Squire's
Autowerke in Bellevue.  Or if you live near downtown, Akers Foreign Auto
is on the top of Capital hill and is a fantastic shop.  Denny Akers is
an experienced wrench as well as a hell of a nice guy.  He owns some
very interesting Porsches as well, including a Pooper which he vintage
races(and tows to the track with a 3.3L Turbo Vanagon!).  There are
several other good shops in the area that I have heard good things about
such as Chris' German Auto and Paul Weir but I don't have personal
experience with them.  Good luck in your quest and make sure to get your
car onto SIR- it is a phenomenal track with great turns and exciting
elevation changes.
