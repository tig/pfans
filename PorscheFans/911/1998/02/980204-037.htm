Mike Piera asked about 73 RS trailing arms, and I gave him my usual
half-remembered notions.  Then I went to the sources. 

Bruce Anderson has a picture of one in his book, and also of the part
welded onto the normal inner pickup points to reposition the bolt location. 
The arm is steel, shorter, and looks, among other things, to have a
relocated shock mount. The book says that the altered mount moved the
inner pivots 47.5 mm back from standard, and also 22-25 mm away from
the center of the vehicle.  The turbo mounts were located similarly, but
were 10mm higher for anti-squat.

Paul Frere gives the same information, except that he says the pickup
points were moved 15mm toward the centerline instead of away!

Who is a poor Porschefan to believe?  One of these months maybe I'll
snoop under a friend's real RS to check out these details, now that I
have a focus for my snooping (although some of you are telling me not all
real RSs had these special arms).

It does seem that the turbo arm should work with an RS mount, though. 
That 10mm higher mounting won't have any effect on toe (if any, will
adjust out), and the effect which it certainly will have on static camber
(more positive) can be adjusted out  You just wouldn't have its anti-squat
action, which you don't really need with 210 hp.  And you wouldn't have
a "real" replica.

Walt Fricke (who also has dreamed of an RS replica from time to time, but
hasn't gotten into it like Mike has).
