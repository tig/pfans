    Just thought I would toss this in since I had it out and a scale handy.
The 915 from my 72 weighs 95 lb with no fluids. The clutch and pressure plate
add about 12 lbs, and a gallon of Swepco adds about another 7 lb, for a max
grand total of 114lb max.
    This is the mag case, and an aluminum pressure plate.

Regards,
Eric
