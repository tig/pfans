P-dudes:

	I'm knee deep in rebuilding my front brake calipers and I have a few
questions - again. 
	First, some history. I have the caliper (left front) on my bench. One
of the pistons would not move when I pumped the pedal, so I decided to
remove and rebuild it. While on my bench, I pushed the moved piston into
the caliper and the brake fluid that oozed out was brownish in color,
almost rusty looking. I realize this could mean the piston(s) is/are
seized or maybe contaminated with water. I'm trying to decide if I
should separate the caliper halves in order to clean both halves very
good before reassembly. Ray Calvo (thanks again, Ray) suggested against
splitting them because replacement seals and hardware might be hard to
get. Obviously, I'd like to avoid any leaking between the halves after
I'm done. OK, enough history, now for the questions. 

	Is there a gasket/seal between the halves?
	Can I get a replacement seal? Or, 
	Can I use RTV between the halves instead?
	Is there another way to clean the inside of the caliper?
	
	Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated!

	Thanks,
	Andy Zimmerman
