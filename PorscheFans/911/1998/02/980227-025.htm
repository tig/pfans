Dude, Fiddle, whatever your name is, :)

First of all, congratulations on at least committing yourself to a project
like this...I have a '68 coupe that I'm re-doing and I've learned a
lot...if you want, respond to me privately and we can get into this-always
glad to talk.

Secondly, Forget the dashboard...there aren't any.  Trust me, I've looked...
The thing to do here is use the later 69 dash and not sweat the
authenticity issue...yes, they're expensive but it's at least
available...this is what I plan on doing, once I get over the cost of my
chassis/engine mods.  If the dashboard in your car is intact, you may want
to look into getting it re-covered.  This is doable, but it won't look
QUITE the same...I have a recovered dash now and  I re-did the forward half
(the flat piece) myself.  While it doesn't look bad and light years ahead
of what I started with...I'm not totally happy with the look-hence the
pending switch to the later unit.  And yes the windshield will need to come
out for this operation involving the later dash.

Thirdly, the door panels...There don't seem to be any of those either.
I say this tongue in cheek as I think the '68 panels are forgettable.  No
one seems to have them anyway.  I went back to the earlier '66-67 style
panels.  They're available just about anywhere.  I think they're a more
authentic looking treatment than  the '68 model panels...Just my personal
opinion of course...but you may want to consider that angle.

Parts? shop til you drop...it really is a competitive parts market out
there.  I must use 10 different vendors-best  overall best price wins in my
book.  I'm not really loyal to anyone.  I seem to use GPR alot, along with
Carlsen's in Palo Alto, and Stoddards' in Ohio (for factory OEM stuff).
I've heard good things about Zims too...so its' worth it to look around.
Find vendors who are willing to work with you personally (should there be
any hassles-and you know there will be at some point...)

The 912 is a good little car. Best of luck.  I look forward to hearing
progress reports from you on occasion

Cheers
