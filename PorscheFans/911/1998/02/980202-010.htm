Recently I submitted a story about a nice drive I had down the coast of
CA and criminal speeds.  Having just read another man's tale of driving
enjoyment I think there is an important piece of brain matter that some
of us lucky few have lost.  It is in no way safe, or considerate to race
or speed through traffic, much less in a city for that matter.  You
never know when someone will change a lane or a child will run after a
dropped ball.  Even when I have been pulled over for insane speeds (well
over 140), half the time I never received the ticket and the other times
the officer wrote 80 or 90, citing my care and caution to slow down to
the speed limit near on ramps and traffic.  It is VERY DANGEROUS TO RACE
CARS THROUGH A CITY no matter how good a driver you may be.  PLEASE DO
NOT GIVE ALL OF US PORSCHE OWNERS A BAD RAP!!!  Show some intelligence.
