     Hi P-Fans,
     
     Has anyone tried to install a CD changer in the luggage compartment ?
     
     I recently bought a complete Blaupunkt set, to keep in line with the 
     German heritage, however there does not appear to be any
"convenient" 
     mounting points.
     
     Does anyone have any ideas, before I start drilling holes ??

I have a '90 C2 Cab and I had a 6-CD Changer put into the boot.  The
installer drilled holes in the passenger side portion of the boot wall and
put it there.  I've had very few problems with skipping - the only real
problem is that it's a pain in the ass when you need to take the spare tire
out, because you have to dismount the changer from the side wall.

BTW, you say you have a '94 993?  I thought '95 was the first year for
993's.
