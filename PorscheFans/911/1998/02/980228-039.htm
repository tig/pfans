I've been using the K&N replacement filters on many vehicles now, and I've
put them into other family cars, if for no other reason than just for the
sake of saving money on buying multiple "Frams" in the years to come.  I've
seen modest increases on a few vehicles, and haven't seen what I'd term
"less performance".

Someone mentioned dyno-ing a K&N setup vs. stock, and the K&N actually
decreased power. (?) All I can guess is that the K&N works best with some
airbox/intake designs, but not necessarily all.  I remember "Sport Compact
Car" magazine doing a test of several different intake systems, (mostly
cone-style open airfilters, with different "pipes" that connect them to the
throttle body.  They said that they thought'd be really simple for
comparisons on a dyno, but as soon as the air warmed up around the engine,
the performance decreased for all of them.  They tried setting up a fan to
circulate air, but found it impossible, or close to impossible to get any
consistent results.  It seems that everything worked great with lots of cold
air, but once the area around the car and engine compartment warmed up,
performance dipped, regardless of which induction system they were using,
yielding significantly different data for the same setup!  I think they just
gave up at some point.

One popular setup, vs. the "replacement type" K&N filter is the cone style
air filter sans airbox/fresh-air-duct, but it seems detrimental in a way,
since you're just getting warm air from the engine compartment, which isn't
as dense with oxygen molecules as cold fresh air. (?)  I've been ducting
some of my vehicles over the years (Roddy Ram Air) and made significant
changes to airboxes to increase the airflow.  The manufacturers commonly try
to reduce intake noise, but that's something most of us like.  (That
trademark "throaty growling noise" can send chills down my spine.)  Anyway,
enough of my yakkin', I hope that I possibly shared some new info within
this rambling, perhaps someone else has some more comprehensive insight...?
Please pardon the lengthy post.
