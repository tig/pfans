Walter,

I'm not sure when the change was made, but the aluminum arms on my race 
car are 84 Carrera pieces, and use a 10mm bolt threaded into a machined 
flat.  I'm not certain if the mounting point on the steel arm is in the 
same location of this threaded hole.

It sounds like "early" rear bars (ball mount style) may be good for 66-83 
cars (end of SC series), with the bolt on style 84+... (start of 3.2)?
