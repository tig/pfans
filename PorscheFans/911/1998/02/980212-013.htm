Hi Andy,

I suspect enough people have told you not to split the caliper.
If they haven't, **DON'T** split it.  You'll have a heck of a time getting
the right o-ring, and no RTV won't do.  (Someone on the list not too
long ago did split a caliper, then tried to find out how to
get the o-ring, and as far as I know, having seen nothing tp the
contrary on the list, has been unsuccessful.)

>How do I clean the
>caliper assembly and remove all the grease completely from inside the
>caliper?

Remove the grease with Gunk or any other grease remover.  Wash real
good in hot soapy water.  Use your favorite detergent.  It doesn't
really matter.  Soap and water is as good as anything.  Gunk might
work a bit faster.  It's a good idea to dry everything by blowing
air on it.

>What am I looking for inside the cylinder walls and on the
>pistons?

The walls don't matter much.  The psiton rides on the seal, so
pits in the walls don't harm anything.  Pits in the pistons do.
If the pitting/corrosion on the pistons is only slight, it can usually
be polished off with fine sandpaper (like 1000 grit) or steel wool
(like #0000).

>Sil Glide brake
>assembly paste when rebuilding brake components. Is this stuff
>absolutely necessary

No. Just use clean brake fluid.
