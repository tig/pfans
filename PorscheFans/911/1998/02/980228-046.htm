Mike,

When you use 18" rims in place of an original size 16" the car is able to
pull higher G forces when turning than with the original equipment.  This
increases the force applied on the lugs and drive train.  Also (and most
important) imagine using theoretically a bigger craw bar to apply force to
the lugs.  When the wheel is bigger the side force applied to the drive
train over all is much much greater.  Having more rubber between the wheel
and the road relieves strees on the drive train.

P.S. English is not my first language so I couldn't really explain
everything that I know on this subject :-)

Luis
