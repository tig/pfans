I've got a '96 993 twin turbo with 7,000 miles.  It's in almost-new
condition.

But it  creaks like an old boat.  Does anyone know why, and, more
importantly, what to do about it?

The creaking sounds like it's coming from the upper part of the cab, maybe
around the doors, but it's hard for me to pinpoint such sounds.  It does it
the most when the chassis/body is flexed, such as when hitting a dip at an
angle, like pulling out of a driveway.  I may be imagining the following,
but I didn't hear this noise when driving in the rain.

Maybe it's coming from under the car and being transmitted thru the body to
a point near my ears, so that it just sounds like it's originating up in
the cab.  I fixed a problem with another 993 by putting Armorall on the
suspension rubber parts.  If this is the case, that would explain why it
doesn't happen in the rain (water lubricates squeeking parts).

But it sounds like the cab creaking.

Has anyone experienced this?  Has anyone fixed it?

Thanx!

      If it ain't broke by now, I can't understand why...
