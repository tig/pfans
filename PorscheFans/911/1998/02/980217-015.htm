I just had to throw in my .02 to this 'string'. Being female and 'in-love'
with Porsche's since the tender age of 4 (I'm 30 now) and NOW the proud owner
of a 96 993, I went through a lot of 'hell' with my husband when I bought it.
He felt extremely uncomfortable about the big car purchase and told me then
that he thought it would help 'end' our marriage.  (FYI: Before we married, I
made it very clear that I would own my Porsche soon and he would have to
accept that before the 'I DO').... Needless to say, we are now seperated (soon
to be divorced) ---no, it is not just because of my Porsche enthusiasm BUT it
didn't help either ...especially all the time I spent at track/autocross/show
events :)  Anyway, I refused to give up the dream and just started driving my
Carrera again yesterday and am really loving my ride!!!!!

The moral?  I don't know... but I just wanted to say that there are obviously
exceptions to the rule of women enjoying Porsche's and being passionate about
them!!!!!
