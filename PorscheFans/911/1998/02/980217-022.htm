Hello,

I just bought a 1974 911 Coupe with a 1980 3.0 engine. This is my first
Porsche project. I decided to start with the engine work. Since I was
not able to do the this myself, retail parts I knew were expensive but
combined with the labor, it ended up costing me a lot more then I had
hoped.  Well atleast the engine is done. So at this point I am trying to
cut costs, not the quality  (if possible?), to get started on the rest
of the projects. If you have any tips, suggestions, options, ideas that
would help me save some money, I'd sure appreciate it.
* I noticed there has been mail about Vertex, where are they located, do
they have a catalog?
* Any recommendations on where to get body kits, and light  packages? I 
like the C2/4 kits.?
* A good source for new and used engine and body parts?
* Any comments on putting 205/50/15's, 8" rims on the front. The car  
came with Fuchs, 2 8" on the rear and (left to right) one 8" and one 7"
on the front. I would like to trade the one 7" for an 8" that someone
might have?
* Any ideas on an inexpensive front and rear valances for tempory use,
this will be replaced with the body kit when I decide which one?
* Any sources on weather stripping/seals/trim for around the windows,
doors, trunk, etc.?
I want to learn all I can about my car, any good books, manuals, that
will help?  Also ones that will walk me through what all the interior
buttons, knobs, and handles are for/do?

Thank You

Judy
