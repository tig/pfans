I have been into P-cars since birth.  Own a '87 Carrera.  Drive it every
day, even in the snow.  Try to do all the work on it myself.  (Some
things are beyond my ability and I know when to take it to my wrench.) I
have heard the name of Bruce Anderson mentioned many times, always
refered to in quite high regards.  (I believe he wrote a book
with/by/for Vic Elford on driving technique which I have misplaced...
Clutz)  Anyway...I am always looking for advice from a knowledgable
P-car person.  Bruce, if you are out there, or anyone else who knows, is
there a bulliten board where you answer questions?  Have you written a
book(s) on the finest autos under the sun? etc.  Please let me know.  I
am ALWAYS hungry for knowledge.  

Thank you in advance for your time!

each.  The carburators on the last three need to be rebuilt. ;) )
