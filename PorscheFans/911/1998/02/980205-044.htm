I primed and painted mine yellow with extra-care (964 calipers) and then
hit them with a clear finish.. and would recommend against it...  first, it
is time consuming to do a good job, secondly, (bright) paint in those harsh
conditions looks like crap after a while...
so.....

remove them and take them to a place and have them powder coated.. it will
resist the heat and chipping.. it is a far more durable finish and it will
run you about 100.00 for four.. look in your local yellow pages for a
place.. they are common... i have to strip my paint and take them to a
place now.. (wish i did it in the first place)
