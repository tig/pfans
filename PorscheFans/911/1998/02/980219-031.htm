Perhaps what I've observed on my 1971 911S would be helpful (although
the car is lowered slightly, has thicker than stock sway/torsion bars,
and uses 15 inch wheels).  For street tires I use 205/55-15's on the
stock 6X15 Fuchs, front and rear.  For track use I put 225/50/15's on
stock 6X15 Fuchs in front and on 7X15 "R" offset Fuchs (with a 5/8 inch
spacer) in the rear.  With both street and track setups there is only
slight rubbing inside the wheel well during full lock turns.

Notes (for MY car):
Front:  I've borrowed, but not raced on, 225/50-15's on stock 7X15 inch
Fuchs and they look like they'll fit without problem because my
suspension is stiff enough.
REAR:  The stock 7X15 inch rims won't work because the extra inch is on
the outside and the tire will extend out past the fender.  That's why I
use "R" offset wheels, which puts the extra inch on the inside.  In any
event, the 225/50-15's fill up the rear fenders, I doubt there is room
for more width.

So, if your '77 fenders are the same as my '71 then I doubt the stock
7X16 rims will fit your rear fenders.  FYI, a 225/45-16 would be about
the same circumference tire as a 225/50-15.

I hope this helps.  From what I've learned, each car is different enough
that you should REALLY try to borrow someone's wheels/tires for a brief
test.  This seems like an especially good idea if you want to push the
limits of what your fenders will hold.
