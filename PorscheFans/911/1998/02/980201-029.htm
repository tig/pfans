Thanks to everyone who responded to my ignition problem (no spark). I
had replaced most of the ignition components and finally found (with
poschefans help) that the points needed to be replaced. 
Now I'm getting a spark but my 77 911S still won't start. 
I recently replaced the fuel distribtor, warm up regulator and filter.
I've triple checked all my fuel connections. 
I've primed the system by pushing up on the lever below the fuel
distributor, with the key on, for 5 seconds. I can hear the injectors
when I do this. Then the car starts and runs for about 5 seconds and
then dies and won't catch again. 
It seems to me that there is not enough fuel getting to the cyclinders
and that the short starts are due to the priming I do. In order to rule
out flooding, I backed off the idle screw a few turns (it was higher
before because my car was running rough ). 
Maybe the (air valve?) lever I mentioned is somehow not in sinc with the
warm up reg? 
Is there something I failed to reconnect or reset?
Although I'm very close getting my car strated, I'm really at a loss as
to what to do next. Any adivse would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
