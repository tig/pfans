I have first hand experience installing them on my (now departed) Alfa.
I even had a very long conversation with the owner/founder
who turns out to be a great guy with an interesting story of how he
conceived of the idea. Apparently he used to work on the docks
loading salt into barges. The salt and water combination caused
corrosion on the hydraulic equipment he used and he found himself
constantly bleeding the systems.  So one day, while he was probably
cursing this tedious chore, and while clicking on a ball point pen the
idea was sprung (pun intended).

The speedbleeder is a very simple idea - simply a spring loaded ball
bearing.  When I installed one on my slave clutch cylinder
I sheared the head right off - and was not applying excessive force.  So
my concern would be with the quality of the steel - they
are perhaps too soft.  BTW, I called them and they sent me 2
replacements for free.

They are manufactured with a composite material applied to the threaded
portion that is supposed to provide an occlusive seal - so as to permit
"one man bleeding".  Their directions are to open up the bleed screw 1/4
turn - and this will not cause a reverse air
leak into the fluid lines due to the seal.   

For the price I think they are worth a shot.  Mine were more like $3.95
each.
