Someone asked about swapping a post '68 front end into '68 or earlier
car.  My race car is a '68, and I kept the early A arms and struts because
it is so easy to raise the spindle - make a spacer, and up it goes.  Of
course, if you lower the car way down it makes sense to cut a section
out of the strut tube, and cut the stub off the bottom of the strut insert. 
Bruce A in his book says he prefers the later setup because the later ball
joint is better.  If he says so, it probably is, but (in race car) I have had no
problems with the older style.  It costs more, but lasts a long time.

I have seen nothing which suggests you can't just fit a later arm and its
associated strut in, although I haven't gone and measured things.  The
steering rack and tie rods should bolt right up.   Porsche would have had
no reason to change the length of anything here.  The changes were to
accomodate the ball joint, not geometry.  Not like the wheelbase increase
at all, I think. 

From examining pictures in manuals there may have been several
methods of attaching the rear of the strut to the cross member.  My race
car setup seemed different than my '77.  The earliest torsion bar
adjusters were secured differently (hardly at all, I think) than later ones. 
However, this could be accomodated by getting a later cross member to
go with whatever A arms you scrounge up. The crossmember is easy to
get out.  If you are after weight savings, you could go to the aluminum
one.
