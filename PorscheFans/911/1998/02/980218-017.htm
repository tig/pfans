Thanks to everyone who replied to my post trying to help me solve my
dilemma.  I finally test drove the Speedster yesterday and sadly realized
that although there is definitely a 911 series car in my future, the
Speedster is not it.  I've driven sports cars most of my life starting with
a Fiat Sport Spyder in the 70's, lots of MGB's, Z's, etc. after that, and I
have reached the point in my life where I need things such as a real door
handle, arm rest, and power mirrors.  It's a beautiful car, mesmerizing in
its beauty, but it's not the right one for me. 

I'm going to up my search to 95 or newer Cabriolet, and it's gotta be
guards red.  At least now I know for sure what I want, and I slept last
night for the first time in weeks.  

The husband has turned out to be pretty supportive now that he realizes
that I'm not gonna live without the 911, but he still wants me to sell the
944.  I'm just pretending to go along with that part of the plan for now. I
don't plan to take the 911 on the track, so "need" to keep the 944.
Although I know once I get it, I may change my mind.  Female perogative,
you know. ;-)
