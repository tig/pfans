Jad,
The heater fan can be removed easily from the top/side of the engine.
The fan uses a brass bushing, rather than a bearing, and thus is more prone
to failure.
I shopped for a used fan for half the price of a new unit, kept my own
housing and replaced only the fan motor/blade unit.  Mine was a 1990, the
replacement fan was from a 1993.

On the plugs, yes they are possible, but the back ones are difficult.  Good
tools are the and patience are the trick... recommend the spark plug tool
in your toolkit.  There was a thread on this subject in the past two weeks
regarding a 993 (basically the same procedure), so you might want to look
thru the archives for it.
Hope this helps, ChrisK.
