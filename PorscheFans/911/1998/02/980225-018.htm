<<Can any one give me advice on K&N air filters.  Windward performance
advertises the K&N Cup Car Filter as "the cheapest way to gain 8 Horsepower,
as quoted by an actual factory engineer."  I called and they said this is a
cone filter that replaces the stock airbox and is priced around $160.00.  Are
these products worth the investment? safe?  I would like to get some modest
performance gains, but am not willing to sacrafice reliability.

Thnx

Dear c4driver,
I realize discussions on the merits/drawbacks of K&N filters will continue
endlessly, but I'd like to test the patience of the PorscheFans group and
repost the following from the MR2 website. You decide whether a small
percentage gain (if any) from using these filters is worth it in the long run.
BTW, there's an interesting article on the use of these filters in the Feb.,
98 issue of European Car (p. 38). It's a comparison of intake air temperatures
using K&N's vs. stock filter and housing on a VW VR6 and its effect on H.P.

Subj:  K & N filters                    
To:  John M.  Saturday, January 21, 1995 5:14:10 PM
From:  George Morrison

John:  If I wrote "subjective" I meant "objective"..  I was responsible for
evaluating re-usable air filters for a major construction/mining company that
had hundreds of vehicles ranging from large earthmovers to pick-up trucks and
salesmen's cars.  This studywas embarked upon due to the fact that we were
spending upwards of $30,000 a MONTH on paper air filters.  Using them one time
then throwing them away..  I inititated the study in that I was convinced that
a K&N type filter or oiled foam would save us many dollars per year in filter
savings, man hour savings, and of course engines as these would filter dirt
better than paper. (yes, I had read the K&N ads and was a believer)

Representative test units were chosen to give us a broad spectrum from cars
right through large front end loaders.  With each unit we had a long history
of oil analysis records so that changes would be trackable.

Unfortunately, for me, every single unit having alternative re-usable air
cleaners showed an immediate large jump in silicon (dirt) levels with
corresponding major increases in wear metals.  In one extreme case, a  unit
with a primary and secondary air cleaner, the secondary (small paper element)
clogged before even one day's test  run could be completed. This particular
unit had a Cummins V-12 engine that had paper/paper one one bank and K&N/paper
on the other bank; two completely independent induction systems.  The
conditions were EXACTLY duplicated for each bank yet the K&N allowed so much
dirt to pass through that the small filter became clogged before lunch.  The
same outcome occured with oiled foams on this unit.

We discontinued the tests on the large pieces almost immediately but continued
with service trucks, formen's vehicles, and my own company car. Analysis
results continued showing markedly increased wear rates for all the vehicles,
mine included.  Test concluded, switched back to paper/glass and all vehicles
showed reduction back to near original levels of both wear metals and dirt.  I
continued with the K&N on my company car out of stubborness and at 85,000
miles the Chevy 305 V-8 wheezed its last breath.  The top end was sanded
badly; bottom end was just fine.  End of test.

I must stress that EVERYONE involved in this testwas hoping that alternative
filters would work as everyone was sick about pulling out a perfectly good $85
air cleaner and throwing 4 of them away each week per machine...  

So, I strongly suggest that depending upon an individual's long term plan for
their vehicles they simply run an oil analysis at least once to see that the
K&N or whatever alternative air filter is indeed working IN THAT
APPLICATION...  It depends on a person's priorities. If you want performance
then indeed the K&N is the way to go but at what cost???

And no, I do not work for a paper or glass air filter manufacturing company
nor do I have any affiliation with anything directly or indirectly that could
benefit George Morrison as a result..
