				^^^^ speaking of which...this was my first
investment as well.  (although strangely, I just don't drive _that_ fast
anymore)  I feel like the one I bought was a total loss however.  Twice
now I've been gunned by police and my radar detector failed to pick
anything up until I passed the police car.  Both times were in periods of
reasonably heavy traffic so I find it hard to believe that I was the
_only_ one that he gunned (thankfully, I wasn't stopped either times).  I
bought an Escort Solo radar detector.  It's a cordless detector, which may
be the problem.  I'm told that sensitivity is decreased by the need for
batteries.  But I do have a cord for it, so theoretically, I could plug it
in.  It claims that is has 360 degree radar and laser capabilities.  I've
found that it picks up a lot more false alarms than anything else.  And
those two times where it would have been very reassuring to see it
register something, not a sound came out of the detector.
