Gary, if all you need is the tab, would suggest going to your dealer.  They
should be able to get it if they don't have it.  Cost is prob. no  more
than discounted mail-order price (from a dealer who discounts) plus
the shipping charge, and it shouldn't be expensive.  If they can't get it,
don't know who can.

Hi Fans.  I'm replacing the cable that releases the fuel door on my SC.  My
main reason for replacing this part is not so much the condition of the
cable, but the condition of the little "tab" (for lack of a better word)
that actuates the release lever for the door.  The "tab" is somewhat
corroded (probably from gas spilling on it).  I got a new cable from Perf.
Products but it didn't come with this "tab".  Anybody know where to get
one?
