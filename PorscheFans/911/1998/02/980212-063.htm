Dear PFans,

This is my initial posting to this list and I would first of all like
to thank the people who run this site and all those who contribute
to it for providing a wealth of useful and interesting information.
I am a first time Porsche owner, having acquired a 1977 911S Coupe
in September '97.  The car has significant modifications, including 930
Turbo flares, tail and chin spoiler, and brakes, and a 1985 3.2L engine.

Mechanically, the car is in very good shape after about 4K worth of
service since purchase.  Cosmetically, it definitely shows signs of
its age in the interior.  Thus my first questions have to do with
interior restoration:

1) headliner - ratty and torn!  Have read in various places about need
to remove front, rear and quarter panel glass.  Is this as easy as some
have suggested or as hard as others with horror stories of broken
windshields have warned?  Opinions on cutting off old seals versus
'hook tool' removal and related methods of extracted 1/4 panel windows
(as well as detailed instructions) would be most welcome.  The car has
a sunroof just to make things more interesting....

2) interior trim - vinyl is, well, vinyl.  20 year old carpet is, well,
dirty!  I am currently corresponding with a PFans subscriber (Hi Mark)
regarding rear deck, 1/4 panel, dash and a couple other pieces.  Having
recently installed new speakers in the back, I know that removal of most

of the rear pieces is very straightforward.  I am less sanguine about
the dash, but hey, the windshield has to come out (see above) so the
time
is now.  I have discovered the ease with which the instruments can be
pulled out of the panel (while also noting the absurd cost of replacing
any items destroyed through misadventure!).  Opinions and instruction on

removing dash and knee pad pieces and the steering wheel would be most
helpful.  Carpeting also seems to be easy enough (Nay madam 'tis, I know

not seems) - any gotchas for the unwary?  Any experience with
aftermarket
vendors (e.g., Automotion, Worldwide Upholstery and Trim, Autos Int'l)
regarding fit and quality (Sliver Knit is planned carpet choice)?

Along these lines, I have also been in contact with Motor Sports Road
and Racing in California about power leather sport seats and a full
leather
black 993 interior.  I would appreciate input regarding the feasibility
of
updating my car with such pieces, both from an aesthetic (originality)
and a practical (will it fit?) perspective.  Any thoughts on wiring
power seats into a non-power car (hey, it's only power and ground,
right?)?  And how do those door panels come apart, anyhow?

3) gauges - since the glass is out, the dash is in pieces, and the
entire interior is in a state of controlled chaos, why not put in
colored
gauge faces?  I have investigated offerings from Performance Products,
NR Auto Accessories, Palo Alto Speedometer, and (God help me) Gemballa.
Is there some trick to removing the glass and getting at those two cute
little VDO screws, let alone yanking off the needles?  Best to let a
speedo
shop do it?

4) wheels - I have 7x16 front and 9x16 rear Fuchs alloys with black
centers.
But the car is a lovely white and has been asking (though not begging)
to
have white centers.  Thanks to list members I have gotten quotes from
Rennsport in Georgia ($120 each for polishing and painting),
Wheel Collision in Pennsylvania, and Wheel Enhancement in California
(both
at about $200 each).  I assume the difference in cost has more to do
with
the finish on the paint (clear coat versus anodized) than with the
polishing - am I right?  Recent listings cited Wheel Enhancement as a
good
shop; is it worth the difference in price over Rennsport?

A complicating factor is the issue of 3-piece wheels.  I saw a 'to die
for'
'83 Slant Nose Turbo Cabriolet that had been restored by a guy in
Sacramento
- called him just two days after the car had been sold (swear I would
have
been out on the next plane and bought that car - but don't we all need a

story about the one that got away???).  The '83 had 3-piece Compomotive
PH model wheels with white centers; all I can say is that they looked
right, along with being gorgeous.  They were 9 and 11 x 16, and if I
understand correctly, cannot be used with the spacers I have on my
car.  Is this right, and true of 3-piece wheels in general (e.g., HRE)?
And if I go with larger wheels (and thus larger tires), do I open up a
new
set of problems regarding suspension setup?  Any other downside to
3-piece
wheels?

Well that's more than enough for one posting!!  Hope I haven't offended
the performance guys with too much bandwidth on cosmetics.  My little
baby and I are just getting acquainted, and she has found a good home.
We'll deal with lap times later.

By way of penance for these ramblings, let me say that I hope not merely

to benefit from this list but also to contribute to it as my experience
and knowledge grow.  Thanks to one and all for your patience and for any

input.
