Over the weekend I got the sucker out.  I hacked away at the sensor =
with
hacksaw and chisel.  Got down to the stub and put an ordinary six point
22mm socket on it.  Cheater bar on my =BD power bar and some leverage =
and
it came loose.  After a week of penetrating oil and tapping, and the
force of the leverage, it unthreaded itself.
I was afraid to use that much force on the 02 sensor socket which I got
from NAPA.  It did not look like it wanted too much abuse, with the
whole side open like that.
Anyway, it is out, new one in with some anti seize on it (as it came
from Bosch-via Stoddard's).
Engine and tranny are ready to go back in now.  New clutch, t/o =
bearing,
pressure plate, plugs, gear oil, valves adjusted, and things generally
cleaned up.  Unusually warm and dry weather around here makes me want =
to
drive...not just look at it.
Thanks for your usual helpful response.

	You can purchase an O2 sensor install/remove socket.  It is a
deep well
	socket of appropriate size (21?  23?) with a slot cut into its
side so the
	wire can stick out.  However, if you are removing an old one and
plan to
	throw it away, you can simply break off and cut off the wire and
	everything else that sticks out of metal hex, and use an
ordinary large
	socket.

	That having been said, I find these things devilish.  I have one
sitting with
	many applications of penetrating oil over a month (engine
rebuild - I am
	behind you this winter, or did you just have your out for less
than a total
	teardown) and so far not budging.  I have had similar problems
before.=20
	Once the plug (like a short bolt) I had in while I wasn't using
the sensor
	also got stuck and I ended up welding something on it to help
turn it after
	rounding the corners of the nut with my crescent wrench.

	My suspicion is that perhaps, despite liberal use of antiseize,
really tough
	carbon or other deposits build up on a few threads which project
	through the threaded boss into the exhaust stream.  However,
since I
	can't see inside my headers to where the sensor protrudes, I
can't verify
	this, and any "evidence" is destroyed when it finally comes out.

	My next step, when getting this out is getting more critical to
my project,
	is to use a welding torch on the boss, hoping that will expand a
bit more
	than the sensor and otherwise break the corrosion loose.  If
that fails, I
	think I will break out all of the innards, and perhaps drill it
out, hoping I
	won't damage the threads of the boss in the process.
