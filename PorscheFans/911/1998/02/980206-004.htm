Part of the concern with BMWs, that is not true for Porsches, is that the BMW
filter setup goes roughly right behind the radiator, sucking in warm air,
where as the stock BMW setup has a snorkle that collects air from the front of
the car and sending it to the air filter.  Porsche, on the otherhand, has no
radiator and, with either setup (I believe), the air comes from the same
general area under the deck lid.  In either case, construction of a cold air
box to only allow outside air to enter the intake would be advantageous.

I would think that the Porsche MSDS setup is better than the BMW one.

There is also the issue of the worth of K&N filters but that has been beaten
to death just about everywhere.  Let's not start on that one.
