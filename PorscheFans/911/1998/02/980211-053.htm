Does anyone know what type of coating was used on the brushed aluminum
dash trim on '67 911/912s?

I'm trying to reproduce the trim that's on my '67 912.  I now have
some great reproductions in unplated aluminum (cut on a laser
cutter!), but have not yet been able to find a plating shop that can
reproduce the original plating.

The original plating has a slightly bluish tint and is not
electrically conductive.  That suggests to me and to the folks I
talked to that the aluminum is anodized.  Unfortunately, modern
anodizing doesn't have the same bluish tint, it's clear.  I've also
tried out "flash chrome plating" and "chem coat" (a clear allodyne
coating, I think).  All three coatings look very good, but nothing
looks quite the same as the original.

Here's a summary of what I've found so far:

Original plating:	slightly bluish tint
			not electrically conductive
			(That suggests to me and to other folks
			that the original is anodized.)

New anodizing:		clear, no bluish tint

New "Chem Coat":	clear, no bluish tint
			electrically conductive

New "Flash Chrome":	slightly bluish tint, but not as much as original



I'd be grateful for any information or suggestions for what to
investigate next!
