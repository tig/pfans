>Hi Greg.  I have an 86 with 66K miles on it.  Last week I was in traffic

These symptoms can point to the idle bypass controller (I believe that is
what it is called) that is located in front of the throttle body as you are
looking at the engine. It is a small metallic cylinder with wires going in
and rubber hoses on each end. Its function is to modulate intake air to the
throttle by bypassing the intake to the exit. It is a two position rotary
solenoid.

Anyway, it is controlled by the DME and can have the following problems:

1) dirty. Remove and clean with WD40 or carb cleaner. If the problem
self-corrected, then this is most likely the case.

2) burned out. After disconnecting, put 12 VDC to it, should click. I
believe that it has three leads, GND, forward and reverse. Use caution here.

3) burned out drive transistors in the DME (can be a side effect of #2).
Requires DME surgery. Only attempt if you understand microprocessor
controllers, drive circuits and soldering techniques.
