My question has to do with what sort of pad works "best" with drilled
rotors.  I recently had a conversation with someone who sells drilled
rotors who strongly recommended the use of a "dusting" type pad such as
Ferodo DS11 with drilled rotors as opposed to something like a Carbon
Metallic or Ceramic pad (like Hawks, Performance Friction, or Pagid).
Their rationale was that "non dusting" pads tend to clog the cross
drilled holes thereby reducing their effectiveness.

Does anybody have any hard facts or real experience they care to share?

Also I am interested in hearing about experience people have had with
crogenically treated cross drilled rotors.  I'm particularly interested
in experience with stock 911SC callipers and rotors.  Did they
dramatically help with cooling? (something I cannot get enough of)

Thanks,
Mark
