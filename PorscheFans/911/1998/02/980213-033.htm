Hi Peter,
Here are a my 1p's worth -  few points to check:

apart from whats in the various books eg Anderson, etc on buying a 911,
I've found the following:-

1. Full service history - at least oil changes every 12000 miles/20,000Km,
(Idealy at a porsche main agent).
2. Check the previous owner - what sort of person is he/she ?
(ideally a fastidiuos enthusiast, with enough money or skill to look after
the car as it should be).
3. Is there any accident damage - pull up the front luggage space carpet
and check carefully for signs of panel damage/overspray/ etc. Also check
around window rubbers - for edges of paint spraying. All 911 shut lines
should be small and even.
Check for original factory sealant around top of front struts. Any ripples
on bodywork at all ?
4. ask long and hard questions about oil consumption this seems to vary
alot from one liter per 1000km, up to virtually none. A puff of smoke at
occacionally at start up is OK.
5. Underneath look for oil leaks, the fewer or none the better, wetness at
the bottom of any barrel (next to crank case is aparently bad news). Check
also oil cooler pipes, up to front oil cooler.
check also feader pipes to camshaftys and tensioners at back of engine -
not serious but they can  be wet with oil leaks.
6. Check rear anti roll bar mountings easy to fix (re-weld, new one on).
Check for grounding damage especially on a lowered car.
7. Electronic heater control unit, and fans in foot well, and heater flap
valves, infront of rear dampers.
8. On the road steering should not pull either way - except on severe
camber, and for niceness there is no reason why steering wheel shouldnt
point forward.
Usual car checks (be through as porshe repairs are expensive, but
thankfully last well (except tyres !!) -  eg Check clutch for plenty of
bite and gearbox syncro.

Hope this helps,
Mark
