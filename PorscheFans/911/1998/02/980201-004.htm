First of all, for autocrossing, I don't think fancy brake fluid is really going
be necessary - I don't see how you could put a whole of heat into the
braking system in a minute or so.  Having said that, I would recommend
you stay away from DOT5 for sure.  I would, as a minimum, make sure
your brakes are bled really well.  You should probably also replace your
brake fluid in its entirety.  For not much money, Castrol LMA will probably
be fine for what you're doing.

BTW, I've found that "AutoZone" here in the Southeast sells Performance
Friction's  "Z-rated" brake fluid for about $6-7 a can.  This seems to be
pretty good stuff (dry boiling point of 550F) for the money - a fraction of
the cost of Castrol SRF and the dry boiling point is only 7% less...
