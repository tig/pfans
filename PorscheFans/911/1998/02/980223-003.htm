Greetings,
Last year I inherited a 84 Carrera, it has almost new (<5k mi.) P7s on the
front but the rears are shot. Because this is a "weekend only" car its
budget priority is rather low, but I need rear tires immediately. (thanks
to El Nino I've been able to drive it all winter here in PA) The choices I
see are as follows:

1) Replace all 4 tires. Best choice but financially challenging for at
least a month or two.
2) Buy 2 new P7s. Tire is discontinued and obsolete!
3) Buy 2 used P7s, anybody have 2 225/50 16 P7s with decant tread for
sale??
4) Put 2 new Dunlop SP 8000s on the back and replace the fronts when
needed.
5) Put 2 new Dunlop SP 8000s on the back sell the almost new front P7s.
Anybody want to buy 2 205/55 16 P7s??

Conventional wisdom suggests that it's not good to mix brands but I am
leaning towards choice # 5. My question is: just how evil will the handling
become, given the mix of tire brands? Any thoughts or better solutions
would be appreciated. Thanks.
