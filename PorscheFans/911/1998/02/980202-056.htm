Thanks Andy,

Very good point, and it deserves a major thread of its own, not just an
aside. What you say is logical, but ask any tiremaker and what do they
answer? "Follow the factory inflation recommendations for your vehicle."

OK, I can see some avoidance of liability here, and it is difficult for
a tiremaker to test each vehicle and every combination of tire and wheel
size. But why does the automotive press (magazines and books), the PCA
or anyone else save lone seekers of truth like yourself raise this
issue? I would like to see more duscussion of a rational program for
do-it-yourself inflation setting (outside of racing)?

Maybe interested list members could start by reporting what tires and
pressures they run on their street cars? 

I did ask a Michelin tire engineer who worked with Porsche to develop
and approve the MXX3 and they at least know(see my next post).
