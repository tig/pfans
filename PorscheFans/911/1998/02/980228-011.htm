Hi Fans:
Thanks for all the good advice on adjusting valves. 
First question is regarding brake pad wear lights. I recently changed F&R
brake pads after the brake pad dash indicator came on. Trouble is, the light's
still on after I changed them. What's up? Do the wear indicators also go bad
and have to be replaced?

Second question is regarding the oil additives that bilstein and lubromoly
sell. Does anyone have experience using them and would/should you use them
even if you're using sythetic oil now?  Seems like overkill to me. 

Lastly. Thanks for all the notes on K&N filters. I've had one for over two
years and am thinking about switching back to paper. A buddy showed me a paper
last year that was written based on a study of motocross motorcycles that
showed much greater cylinder wear  with bikes that used K&N filters.

best regards,
