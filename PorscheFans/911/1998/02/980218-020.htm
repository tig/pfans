Hi,

Can anyone comment on the following for a '90 C2 Coupe... (I mentioned this
in another note but it was buried near the bottom so might have been hard
to notice ;^)

I've found someone that has a set of "OEM sport shocks and Euro RS springs"
for sale, decent price (I think).

The shocks are apparantly off a '94 RS America, and he thinks the springs
are from a Cup car (will apparantly lower the car about an inch).

Shocks have 9,000 miles on them. I think I can get the lot for $500.

Does this look like a decent combination for a C2 coupe? Price? I was pretty
interested until he mentioned he *thought* the springs were from a cup car
which a) kind of indicates he doesn't really know what they are and b) if
they ARE from a cup car I'd have thought they'd be way too stiff (I'm looking
for improved street/autox/driver's-ed suspension)

Cheers!

Ross
