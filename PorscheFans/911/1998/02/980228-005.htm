Hi,

I assembled the engine case and noted something odd about
the O-rings. The M10 bolts that go thru the case and are sealed
at both ends with an O-ring (999.701.006.04). This is a transparent
blue 8 x 2 mm O-ring and there is 24 pcs of them.

On the 1-2-3 side of the engine holes are not chamfered, but
on the 4-5-6 side the holes are chamfered in the case.

Bolts were installed so that cap nut is on the 4-5-6 side.
Holes in washers are chamfered.
I noted that in some publications bolts are other way, cap nuts
are on the 1-2-3 side.

Now when the cap nut is tightened, the O-ring squeeze little out =

from the 1-2-3 side. I noted that the O-rings was slightly squeezed
before disassembly also. As the hole is chamfered on 4-5-6 side, =

the O-ring stays there nicely. =

O-rings was carefully lubricated with Dow 111, this is a silicone paste.

I think something is wrong here and are afraid that the bolts will leak. =


What is the proper way to assemble these bolts with O-rings?
- Cap nuts on 1-2-3 side or 4-5-6 side?
- What is the trick to keep O-ring from squeezing out?

Finland         and always wondering.......


PS. Porsche recommend as case sealant Loctite 574, there is
        now a new Loctite 5206 that has a better heat resistance.
        Check with local Loctite.
