Hello All

Thought I'd  pass along my recent experience with a cruise control box
rebuild. Several P'fans have recently queried the list about where to go to
fix VDO cruise control boxes found in early to late '80s 911s and 928s. I
sent mine to Mr. George Murphy, proprietor of Performance Analysis in Oak
Ridge, TN ((423) 482-9175).  For $149 plus $8 return shipping (it cost me $9
to ship the box to him via UPS from Omaha), he'll return your box rebuilt
with a new amplifier. Or, if you're in a hurry, he'll send you another
rebuilt unit on an exchange basis. I had mine rebuilt and the turn around
time was about two weeks. So, for a total outlay of $166 I have a cruise
control that works like new  with no more bleed-off or surge (mine quit
working completely). George was very good to work with and I recommend his
services. BTW, his main business is selling do-it-yourself oil analysis
kits. Might have to try one of these this DE season.
