	I bought a new 993 C4S.  Unfortunately, I had to take delivery of
the car on a very bad day (at night, in the rain) because I had to leave
the following day.  I noticed later that night that there is a scratch on
my hood about halfway up on the left side.  There are a couple that look
like they could easily be buffed out but there seems to be one that is
about 1" long that is in the paint itself.  I called my dealership about
this and they said they could take care off the buffing but they didn't
really have a response to the scratch that seems like it's in the paint.
Does anyone know what can be done about this?  I'm disappointed but I
really don't want the dealership to dab touch up paint on the hood because
usually I find that the touch up looks horrendous.  I'm sort of worried
about having them repaint the hood because I appreciate the paint job done
by Porsche and would hate to have a poor job done by a local paint shop.
Any ideas?
