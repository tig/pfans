Andrew - 

You ask about your 915 tranny first gear (and reverse) grinding
problems and some costs and options.  I'll share my experiences with
this.

Parts for replacing second gear synchro and dog ring, and the
first/second gear slider, plus some gaskets and stuff came to about
$250, just to give you an idea.  I did all rest of work myself.  In a week I'll
see how it works when I get engine back together and all in car.  In past I
usually ended up paying $4-800 when I took my tranny to a shop and
they did this sort of work, the higher figures when more parts were
needed.

I think used trannies can be had for $800, no guarantees, of course.

Second is most frequent problem, third next in my (limited mostly to
myself) experience, as they see most use and abuse.  First is a new one
to me (probably not to real Porsche mechanics, who see it all).

It shouldn't pop out of first, so chances are good your first gear slider is
gone.  Possible it is just the synchro ring (much cheaper).  The synchro
ring locking into the center of the slider is what keeps it in gear - when in
first it is the first gear ring locking there, and in second it is the second
gear synchro coming in there from the other side.  This keeps the dog
teeth of the gear locked to the teeth on the slider.

While the first gear synchro is a bit baulkier to operate for some reason I
can't fathom (there are some design differences, but hard to see why
they make engagement harder), it shouldn't ever grind if things are up to
snuff.  While double clutching is never a bad thing when downshifting,
you really shouldn't have to do it in ordinary street driving where you are
usually  just rolling along when you want to drop it to first without
stopping - the synchros should handle this easily. 

 However, I notice this baulkiness mostly when at a full stop - it doesn't
want to go into first sometimes.  The armstrong method is not
recommended, you can bend things in the transmission (don't ask).  A
few tries, into second first, incantations, whatever.  I think careful
adjustment of the shift coupling may help with this, as you need to get
the ball end of the shift lever which is inside of the tranny completely in
its first/second gear notch, and not bumping even a little bit the 3d/4th
notch (tranny cleverly designed so you can't push it into two gears at
same time).

On the other hand, like you I often use on a cold engine/tranny the trick of
putting it in another (hopefully less worn) gear to stop things from
spinning.  Did you start out on old VW s with no synchro in first?  Any
gear should do it, as it will lock the previously spinning input shaft to the
stopped (because you are stopped) pinion shaft.  Nothing should grind,
synchros shot or not, after that.  Unless you are getting a little clutch
drag - ulp.  Or if you are getting a little pilot bearing drag.  

Bruce A warns of the evils of a dry pilot bearing, which can eventually
friction weld the input shaft to the flywheel!  

I am noticing on wife's '84 that it won't go into gear when (mild Colorado
wintertime) cold (so I start it in gear, or stop engine, etc) without grinding,
but after a few miles all is well.  I would welcome anyone's experiences
with this.  I dread taking out the engine to get at clutch/pilot bearing, but it
I have to I have to.  I am hoping that perhaps the otherwise adequate pilot
bearing grease just needs to warm up.  Or that a cold clutch maybe
doesn't move along its splines enough to prevent a little drag.  Other
times I fear I am indulging in wishfull thinking.  Like thinking cold tranny oil
might induce parasitic drag - how would that cause a stopped shaft to
start moving again without engine motion being somehow transmitted to
the gearbox?  If this continues into the summer I know I have my work
cut out, I suppose.

But I think you may have to pull your tranny.  Popping out of first (or any
other gear) isn't part of the normal equation, even if you could live with
the other problems.
