Response to Ed Baus:
I purchased one of those filters earlier this year.  I personally cannot
tell any difference.  I also belong to the BMW mailing list and there
has been a lot of discussion on cone filters.  The general concensus on
the BMW list is that - yes, more air is flowed but because the filter is
exposed, there is more turbulance and the air is hot.  This makes for
lower horsepower.  I just got a G-Tech meter and perhaps, this summer, I
will run it with the factor airbox and then with the cone filter to see
if there is any difference.  Although I can't see any difference, a 5 to
10 horsepower gain would be difficult for anyone to "feel" except
perhaps a race car driver.  To smooth out the airflow, I have also added
the turbo twister to the intake which is supposed to swirl the air
better.  Again, I could not "feel" a difference.  However, I have a 3.2
Carrera engine and the G-Tech measure about 218 horsepower.  I should
add 10% (G-Tech measures actual HP on the ground and not at the rear
wheels - they tell you to add 10% to 15% to your readings.)
