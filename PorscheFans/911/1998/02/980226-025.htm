Hello Folks:

Since I bought my car @30,000 mi (it now has 60k),I have had quite a bit of
noise from the front suspension - especially when turning sharply at slow
speeds. More of a crumple noise than a squeek. However, at highway speeds I
rarely hear it. I have had no adverse tire wear but I do plan to club
auto-X and Drivers Ed this year.  And, I am worried about safety and the
noise is annoying.  Up on the alignment rack it doesn't make the noise.
The only way to induce the noise without driving is jack up one side a bit
and turn the steering wheel extremely right and left.  The rear "a" arm
bushing on the right side seems to be the source. I am told that you have
to either buy the whole "a" arm with bushings made on or go to unacceptibly
stiff/squeaky aftermarket bushings (how would get the old ones off?). I
would think the car is too low mileage to have bushing failure. I also been
told that the steering rack has a damaged tooth among a few other things.

I seem to recall reading somewhere (Excellence/Pano)that a commom problem
with 911/930s is a weld in the "a" arm pivot that is sometimes too big and
when the bushings settle some you get a noise and the solution is to grind
off the weld a bit.

Anybody experienced this problem and got a easy solution?

Thanks
