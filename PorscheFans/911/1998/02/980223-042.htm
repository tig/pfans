Vince,
Just a word of caution if you decide to go with the B&B muffler.
I purchased a B&B dual inlet/dual outlet muffler for a 911SC a couple of 
years ago and the first muffler I received was the racing muffler which 
was LOUD! This was returned and replaced with a touring muffler which 
was a lot quieter but also produced a lot of resonance between 2000 and 
3000 rpm. This was also returned and B&B reduced the flow at the right 
outlet. However, though the muffler was a bit quieter, the resonance was 
still there.

If you do decide to go with a B&B muffler, please let me know what you 
think. It is possible that they may have improved their design.

Regards, Syed
