Answers to various Porschefans questions that I've been meaning to post to:

>What does "CV" stand for?

I think it means "constant velocity".  (If I had more sleep, I'd have some
witty comment to make or other creative definition.)
=========================================
One side of the blinker lights are supposed to stay on in that instance for
the reasons mentioned (required for "parking" in Europe) Every Porsche I've
owned did that, even when I didn't want it to :-)
=========================================
"IMHO" means "In my humble opinion" There are plenty of variations of this but
I don't have enough sleep to remember the funny ones.
=========================================
You may find foamy stuff at the mouth of the oil filler cap if you have been
running the car too much without letting it get sufficiently warm often
enough.  Years ago I lived about 0.8 miles from my office.  Foaming was a
constant problem (so I moved away and foam at the traffic jams instead).  I
learned to take it out and run it hard for at least 20 minutes at least once
weekly so it would warm up enough to bake out the foam (at least that is what
I told the kind officer).  I think it could harm your engine if you let it
accumulate. It could turn to water, if there's too much to heat into steam.
Water displaces oil and allows metal to touch metal - not good.
=========================================
Well I've answered everything I could, IMHO
