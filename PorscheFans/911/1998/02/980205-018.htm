I wouldn't lie about a track incident.  Years ago a car was totaled at an
event in Texas and the guy brought the car elsewhere and reported the
'accident.'  The insurance dutifully paid.  Several years later the insurance
company received a letter that included a picture of the wrecked car at the
track.  The owner went to jail for some time and is now, I believe, a
convicted felon.  Not worth it.  Over the years we have had a number of
incidences at DE events and I never heard of an insurance company not paying.
One even was insured by Leland West and they paid, even though they exclude DE
events in their policies.
