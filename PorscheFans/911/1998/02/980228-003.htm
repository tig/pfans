Is it just me, or is this not logical?  This subject has come up before and
I've always wondered how in the world the car can tell what diameter
the wheels are.  Seems to me that as long as the overall diameter of
the wheel/tire combo is close to a stock diameter, the car won't know
the difference (unless of course some strange wheel offset causes
rubbing or something...).

My '76 has 9x17s on the rear - I'm sure the factory never even dreamed
of doing that back in '76 (it came with 6x15s from the factory...)
