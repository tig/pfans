Well, I'll be.  Thanks for enlightening me.

This same feature is provided in my '87... I think.  I've noticed for
a while that once the engine is off, I can still activate my power
windows...maybe...sometimes.  Out of pure curiosity, I attempted to
determine how/when/why the circuitry was disabled.  On one particular
day, I thought I had it figured out, only to be proved wrong the
next.  Finally, I too attributed the operating characteristics to
alignment of the planets and the mood of my guardian mermaid.  Now,
I'm glad to know that Porsches still adhere to the laws of physics
and general circuitry.

Fortunately, I never suffered from battery drain :-)

Keep Porsching,
Wayne

I think I now know why my C4 was running down the battery this winter. It 
turns out to be an interesting diagnostic story.

But I had another problem in the winter that I never mentioned. When the 
cold weather would come my interior (dome) lights wouldn't light up when I 
opened the doors. I could fiddle with the switch on the door jamb and pull 
the plunger out and get the lights to come on. But sometimes they just 
wouldn't come on. I suspected a bit of corrosion on what is a very simple 
spring loaded switch. It was probably a combination of the rubber cover 
becoming stiff when cold and an aging spring that couldn't quite force the 
plunger to close the switch. I just lived with it during the cold weather. 
Eccentric hand-built cars and all that.

The problem, you see, is that Porsche in their infinite wisdom provided a 
convenience feature on the 964. They decreed that with the key removed you 
should still be able to activate the windows and sunroof until you get out 
of the car. Allows you to close the windows if you forgot. Or to crank the 
roof a crack to let the heat escape while parked. And there is a circuit 
that is energized -- *until you leave*. And how, you ask, does your car 
know when you've left? Easy! When the dome lights come on. Then this 
convenience circuit is de-energized.

Since the door switches never tripped the dome lights this circuit was 
staying energized until my battery was drained. The fix was to replace the 
switches and rubber covers.
