Chip was nearly 100 percent correct.  Mineral oils contain a component that
keeps oil seals swollen.  The formulators of the early synthetics were unaware
of the need for such a component and early synthetics tended to cause seals to
contract.  Synthetics made in the last 10 years all contain additives to keep
seals from shrinking.

I've heard the argument that synthetics flow better past a leaky seal but am
not sure that there is any scientific basis for it if the oils are are of the
same viscosity and thus have the same fluid flow properties.  I've also heard
that synthetics may remove deposits from the vicinity of a seal that may have
been preventing the seal from leaking.
