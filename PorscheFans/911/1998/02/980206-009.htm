The Speedbleeder appears to be a variation of an item
that has been around almost forever, and that can be found
at almost any autoparts store for about $5, although it's
only worth about $1.  It's a simple ball and spring check-valve,
usually inserted in a plastic tube that can be slipped over the
bleeder valve.  The Speedbleeder simply puts the check-valve
right into bleeder valve.  I suppose it's a clever idea, but you'll
still have to crawl under each wheel to release the Speedbleeder,
and unless you want to have  brake fluid squirting all over,
you'll want to slip tubing over it to direct it to a
receptacle, and you'll need someone to watch what's coming out to
see when there are no more bubbles so you know the air has bled
out and you can stop bleeding that caliper unless you rig an
elaborate set of mirrors, all of which sort of makes one
wonder about the advantage of the Speedbleeder over the commonly
available el-cheapo check-valve, or the even cheaper plain vanilla
hose inserted into a cup with a bit of brake fluid in it.
