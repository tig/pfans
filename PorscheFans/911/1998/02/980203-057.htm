Hello all,
  I'm a _long-time_ lurker located near Rockford, Illinois.  I just wanted to
comment about the local Porsche dealer, and their excellent mechanic.  Bob
Smith is a great guy, very knowledgeable about Porsches (almost 20 yrs of
experience), and very free with information for the best and most cost-
effective way to maintain your Porsche.  Again, the dealer is Napleton's
AutoWerks, located in Loves Park, IL  (near Rockford, just off I-90).

  For the person who asked about condensation in the right-rear taillight of
their 964, my 1990 C2 also suffers from this problem.  Perhaps the problem is
minute cracks in the lens....I really don't know, but I've got it too. 

Best regards,


Tom Fernandez

PS.....I'm looking for a Vespa motor scooter....if you have one, write to me!
