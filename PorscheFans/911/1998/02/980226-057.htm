Hi all,

Well I just finished my first valve adjustment job on the car and I thought
I'd give it a treat with new plugs while I was in there.  My local Bosch
supplier recommended the platinum WR8DP plug for my 78 SC, but when I
pulled out the first of the old plugs it was a WR5DP, which is the plug for
the 75-77 911S and 80-83 SC cars.  What effect will the different plug
have, and does it make a difference that a PO removed the air pump
completely from the car?  Would anyone recommend keeping the cooler WR5
plug?

Any advice on replacing the shift coupler bushings, the rear sunroof seal
or the back up light switch would also be appreciated.  Is it necessary to
drain the transmission oil before pulling the light switch?   

I am planning to switch to using Swepco transmission oil as everyone seems
to agree it's the best stuff for 911's, are there different grades, which
one would best suit the 915 transmission in my car.

I have learned much from this forum since I acquired my first 911 a few
months ago, thanks to everyone who has helped.
