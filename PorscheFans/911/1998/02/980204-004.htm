P-Fans:

I am a new owner of a 911 SC and checked my oil for the first time
yesterday.  I found two things:

	1.  White scum/spooge had collected all around the inside of the
cap and pipe.
	2.  When the cap was removed it sounded like the engine was
having a hard time maintaining the idle.  I think the RPMs dropped by
about 	100 and returned to normal when the cap was replaced.

Is this normal or not?

Also, I have an '82 with a Momo aftermarket steering wheel.  After I
make a turn the turn signals do not shut off.  I was wondering if this
is because:

	1.  I have an aftermarket wheel & hub.
	2.  That feature was not around when the car was made.
	3.  Something is broken.

If I can somehow aquire this feature in the form of repairs/new
additions that would be great!

-Michael, who is having lots of fun trying to choose a new interior.
