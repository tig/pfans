I am about to buy a jan 94, 993 with 50000 miles on it. The car looks high
mileage and is priced accordingly. The Porsche Approved Centre thats
selling it are certain its genuine mileage but being the cynical sort I
want to check. Just because it has correct service records does not satisfy
me.

My question, how can I check? I dont want to ask the dealer to rip the car
apart but is there a simple way to reassure myself or will the devious
clocker always win? What if the speedo cable was cut or the speedo
disconnected? Is it easy to see if the dashboard has been pulled out?

The dealer said all the onboard computing power does not record mileage,
disconnected speedos etc.

Sorry to be so negative but when values depend so much on mileage there is
big money involved.

Antony
