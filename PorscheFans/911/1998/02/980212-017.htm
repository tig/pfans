I cannot comment on California in particular, but can give my
experiences in Virginia along with general comment.

I purchased a grey market 1980 930 in 1987 from the PO who had
DOT/EPA'ed it in the state of Maryland.  When I registered it in
Virginia the DMV computer stated that the Vehicle ID# was invalid. 
Porsche had provided a range of valid ID#s to the DMV and my number was
outside of that range - so invalid.  I had to have a DMV employee
inspect the car and verify the serial number (a practise that is
universal in some states but not Virginia).  They grudgingly allowed me
to have a temporary registration but refused to issue a title pending
their investigation.  As you might imagine I was quite uncomfortable
with this; the PO assured me that I had nothing to worry about but I was
sweating.  The fact that he was a successful doctor living in a multi
million dollar home, (and I knew where he lived) made me feel somewhat
better.  Six months later I received a title from the Virginia DMV.

The same problem arose with my insurance company, Travellers.  The ID#
was invalid as far as they were concerned (out of range), but I
explained the problem and insurance was issued pending the receipt of my
new title.  

On the good side, the dreaded personal property tax assessor (4.75%
annual tax payable on value of car), not being able to find the ID# in
the valid range, decided that the car was worth $4000, and has kept my
taxes at a minimum.

I received all the EPA/DOT paperwork with my car and would suggest that
you get the same with any grey market car that you purchase, especially
if you ever want to sell the car to someone in another state.  When I
have discussed selling or trading my car in, I have always been
confronted with the argument that grey market cars are discounted in
value because of the paperwork problems.  Additionally, there were grey
market cars that had paperwork issued by fraudulent shops without the
requisite work being done on them; these cars give all grey market cars
a bad name.  Unless you can get the grey market car at a discount, and
unless it is absolutely the car that you are looking for, I would say
pass on it.
