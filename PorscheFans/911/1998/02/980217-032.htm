You're very welcome.

Don't really know the absolute figures, but I'm sure Lou at Ruf can quote 
you weight over the phone and I recall a posting on the list with stock 
Porsche wheel weight a few months back. The issue of weight matters in two 
ways. First there's the gyroscopic and inertial effects of the mass when 
you're trying to turn. Second, the extra weight is literally a pain when 
I'm changing wheels back and forth for the track. For mostly street use, 
and occasional DE on same wheels there is nothing wrong with the Rufs. In 
fact they were my early choice. I ultimately decided against them because I 
wasn't sure they would clear the big red brake calipers I planned to add.

> Do you mind my asking what the RUF suspension setup cost?
From my notes at the time: I was considering a few different options. To 
just go with H&R lowering springs was $360, plus $275 to install. The H&R 
double-spring struts and springs that mimic the latest Cup car setup were 
around $3000, and $300 to install. An adjustable F/R swaybar was around 
$600. The Ruf kit seemed very reasonable at around $3300 since it included 
Bilsteins at all four corners, new rear springs (on the C4 the front ones 
are reused, don't know about the C2), sway bars F/R and a very understated 
(and light) front tower brace.

Don't forget to add in a bit of cost for corner balancing and four wheel 
alignment after you've made these kinds of changes to the suspension.
