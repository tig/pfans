Great comeback to all of us "Are you sure you're ready for a *real
sports car*"  snobs :)

Believe me there are times when I wish my AC worked well enough
to consider keeping it.  And as far as overall comfort goes
my 71 makes my friend's Carrera feel like that Catera you mentioned,
so it's all relative.

As far as the lowered suspension goes and it's desirablility, my first
response was "take it as is and smile", but I will qualify that:

*** First let me say that I do not claim to be a tire/wheel/suspension
expert, but I can relay the experience I had on my car. ***

If it has been lowered such that you no longer have  sufficient suspension
travel to keep your tires from rubbing on the fender wells, it's definately
not good.

This was the case for me when I bought my car:  The rear tires would
rub on the fender wells when I hit servere bumps.  The result of that
problem is that today all the paint on my rear quarter panels is cracking :(

This problem was caused by someone putting 16" wheels on an early car
while doing nothing to the suspension to offset the reduced clearance.
I have since fixed the problem with stiffer shocks and torsion bars,
and on the front have raised the spindles on the shocks 17mm to allow
for an aggressive ride height while not sacrificing suspension travel.
There may be other ways to solve this problem, but the issue is that you
need to take a systems approach.  I also had the inner fender lips rolled in
the front to create more clearance for the front tires.

All of this is to say that if the lowering was done professionaly
and with a systems approach to the problem, you could have a really
great set up.  If it was a hack, then you may be better off fixing
it or returning to stock config.  Of course, even if it is done correctly,
you still may not like it :)

> Question to the list : any specific points I have to look for during the

Make sure the suspension does not bottom out in normal driving and
see if the front is not so low that you scrape the spoiler/pan every
time you go into a driveway.  Look inside the fender wells for evidence
of interference.

Other than that have a great drive and try to hide the permanent grin
you will have.  It may adversly effect your negotiating position :)
