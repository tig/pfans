G'day all,

I am posting this for a friend.

He has a 1981 930 that has just developed this interesting condition of
a clicking sound coming from the engine under heavy acceleration. You
would almost think that the car was pinging. If you floor the
accelarator the sound starts and just keeps going until you change
gears. Under non heavy acceleration (normal driving conditions) the car
does not make the noise.

Even when the car is idling and you give the accelerator a quick
"heavy"  press you can hear the click  The click is heard before the
cars revs increase. If you gently accelerate, the click sound is not
heard.

The cars performance does not seem to be adversley affected. As far as
everything else is concerned the car seems to be fine.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
