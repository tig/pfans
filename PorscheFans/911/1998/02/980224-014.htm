I am looking to buy a 92 C2-Coupe.  The Car is a manual transmission, has
air, ps, pb, p-seats, sun-roof, CD, and is guards red with a tan interior.
Currently has 52k on the odometer the asking price is $32,000.  I have never
owned a Porsche before but have saved for years to afford this car.  I hope
this is the forum for these questions.  Some questions I have are as follows:


1. I have looked at Blue Book for the car and in a lot of classified ad's
and $32,000 seems to be to low.  I brought a friend who does some of his own
restorations and he says the car has never been painted or wrecked.  Also I
called the Toy Store (dealer in Fl.) and the sales guy I spoke with told me
that only about a thousand 92 C-2 Coupes came to the states and that this
car is relatively rare.  My question is why the low price?  The wholesaler I
am buying the car from has been in business for several years and I am sure
they are no fools.  Is this car rare?  Will it hold its value better than
others?
*****************
'92 was one of Porsche's low sales years in the States. Total sales were
only about 4-5k cars, so yours isn't all that rare in the context of the
year overall. $32k is within spitting distance of the general range for
these cars, which are overshadowed by the '95 993s introduced just 2 years
later. Those who can afford it are going for the 993s. Your car will hold
its value better than other marques; just don't expect an investment
windfall from ownership.
******************

2. I am not purchasing it from a dealer.  The company selling it is
basically a wholesaler of exotic cars in Mi.  They are sending it to an
authorized dealer to have an inspection (that I am paying for) done today.
What things will this inspection tell me?  What warning flags should I look
for?
****************
Is the dealer in MI also? What's their relationship to the wholesaler? The
inspection should include a compression and leakdown test (done on a warm
engine) to provide some perspective on the engine, especially if it's been
shipped. Excessive valve guide wear is the thing you want to look for. 

Try to get an idea of the clutch condition. You can bet that a "chipped"
car has been run enthusiastically, which is fine if all the needed
maintenance has been done. Have you seen pictures of the car?
**************** 

3. The car also has an after market exhaust and the "chip".  This scares me
into thinking that the previous owner rode the car pretty hard.  I do not
really care about the extra 10hp that this chip gives me.  Would it be
better for the engine for me to put the original Porsche chip back in?
***************
The "chip replacement basically reprograms the engine control system to
provide greater spark advance and different fuel delivery, favoring
higher-RPM performance over economy, low-end torque, and emissions control.
In a normally aspirated car, you shouldn't see any great wear problems in
52k miles (other than possible valve guides). The aftermarket exhaust
should have been selected with the chip in mind in order to better "tune"
the system. If you're not planning to run real hard (frequent Porsche Club
of America driver's schools, for example) you won't have any problem.
**************

4. I read in Excellence magazine that you should take the engine under-tray
out.  Why would you do this?
************
Remember, these are air-cooled engines. Anything that can increase the flow
of cooling air to the engine will aid in prolonging its life. Removing the
undertray will provide more air to the engine compartment, and also make it
easier to access the underside of the engine for cleaning, oil changes, etc.
************

5. What is your rough guess on yearly maintenance, I plan about 10,000 miles
a year?  
************
My experience has been that a 10,000 mile car will get three oil changes
(11 quarts a clip!) annually (forget the factory manual and change it every
3,000 miles.) Also, plan on one "major" service visit (lube, align,
inspect, set CO, change belts, possible brake pads, etc.) that usually runs
me about $600. Depending on your driving habits, plan on a set of rear
tires every 12-15k miles, and fronts about every 15-20k. BFG Comp T/A ZR
street tires go for about $700 a set mail order, plus mounting.

6. Do you think the 964 cars will depreciate in value faster due to the body
style of the 996's being so different?  Or might they actually go up in
value (wishful thinking)?
******************
Being newer, your car will depreciate a little faster until it's about 10
years old, after which it may slow down a bit. 
*****************

7. Lastly when taking it for a test drive after starting the engine cold it
would idle then jump up about 400 rpm for a second, then back to idle then
back up 400 rpm, this would happen for about 10 seconds then it would hold
still on idle.  Also this would not happen when the car was warm.  Is this
normal for a Porsche?  Could the after market chip be responsible?
***************
Sorry, I'm not familiar with the causes of this, though I've had it happen
on a'68 911 Targa I once owned, a wildly different car from yours.
**************


Fans, I hope you can afford a couple of minutes to answer my questions.  If
I feel comfortable with the inspection and possibly the answers that you
give me I hope to take possession this Friday (been dreaming of this since I
was seventeen).  Thank again for your time.  Being new to the group I hope
this is the proper place for these questions.
**************
I hope you've had an opportunity to see the car and form your own opinions
of it. The best advice in the world won't help if you don't feel fully
comfortable with what you see. Your advisors won't go wailing down the road
with you, won't  get the same silly grin on their faces, won't get the same
raft of speeding tickets the first month, won't write the service checks,
won't....... 

Good luck with your new baby!
