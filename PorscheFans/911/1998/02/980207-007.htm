A week or so ago, an inquiry (sorry I don't have the original message or
poster's address) inquired about a 1988 911 they were looking to purchase.

At the time, as a former owner of an 88 Coupe sold 3+ years ago, I thought the
asking price was "outrageous" especially for the mileage and condition of the
car as described.  

Today in the local paper (the Dayton, Ohio Daily News) an ad appeared for:
"Porsche '88 Targa 911-Black with black leather int.,CD, A/C, power windows
and locks, Original owner.  Well maintained.  Beautiful automobile!!
$22,000/OBO. Call 436-7353 or 436-0604".

DISCLAIMER...I know nothing about this vehicle or it's owner (whether a
private individual or dealer...the phone answering machine contained a woman's
voice with no business identification on both numbers).  Incidentally, the
area code is (937).

If anyone has interest in this automobile after contacting the owner, I'll be
glad to take a look at it and give you my "unfettered" opinion as a former
owner of  several 911's (and other Porsches over 36 years).
