Hi Don,
I heard you got a new red toy from Kenosha.  Shannon said you have been
redoing everything that can be redone as far as preventative maint. goes.
Sounds like a good idea. I'm sure the good folks at Checker love to see you on
a daily basis.   I just replaced the brake pads on my 911 with some
carbon/kevlar race pads.  Neat but $$$.  They have a higher friction coeff and
stop like crazy and don't fade but put out lots of dust and squeal a bit.
Shannon was nice enough to dignose a door rattle on my pathfinder which she
felt needed immediate attention.  She said "my dad has taken apart lots of my
doors to fix rattles.  You have to fix it!"  You've created a monster.  You
should pick up the latest edition of Excellence magazine.  I meant to send my
copy home with Shannon.  It has a big pictorial and article about a guy's
restoration of a 356c which is red with a black int.  Looks pretty sharp.  You
can get the magazine at BDalton or Tower records.  Sounds like Shannon 's
health tests came out with normal results.  That was good to hear.  Anyway I
may see you this weekend if Shannon has it in her plans.  
Brian
