As an aerodynamicist whose designed inlets for subsonic and supersonic
aircraft I can guess at what happened.  Removing the air cleaner changes
the shaping of the surface that leads into the airflow sensor causing a
potential "venturi effect" that limits the airflow into the engine.  A
smooth "bellmouth" shape is needed to insure the flow stays attached to the
sides of the intake air ducting, if separation occurs the apparent area the
air "sees" is reduced with a commensurate reduction in mass flow.  The
cover and no cover performance similarity makes sense, if this is not the
"bottleneck" point in the air intake system it shouldn't degrade
performance to have it on or off.  As for the K&N filter providing higher
horsepower on the order of 8 HP, I find that very hard to believe.  The
whole idea behind the filtration system is to get the dirt out without
restricting the airflow.  Typically, the larger the filtration area, the
lower the pressure loss across the filter, and the less airflow
restriction.  Engineers need to trade off compactness and space limitations
against performance loss, thats why the Porsche filters are so large, and
why I scream obscenities every time I need to close the back cover clips on
the air cleaner following spark plug changes or valve adjustements.  Trust
me, as a engineer working on fighter jets, I can assure you that Porsche
engineers didn't leave 8HP "on the table" when they designed the engine.
Lastly, someone posted on this list a detailed description of K&N filter
performance on a fleet of earth moving equipment that showed SEVERE
degradation on reliability due to fine particulate matter getting through
the filter.  If your looking at air filtration for horsepower, you're
barking up the wrong tree. My thoughts for whatever there worth.
