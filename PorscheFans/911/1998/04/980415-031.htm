    Matt:

    Drive the car until the oil warms up to operating temperature
    (ten minutes or so).  Park it on a level surface and LEAVE THE
    ENGINE RUNNING.

    Pop the bonnet, open the oil filler cap, and reach inside the
    neck of the filler for the dipstick.  Remove it, wipe it off,
    and carefully re-insert it fully.  Note that it doesn't just
    drop into the filler; there's a slot on the side of the filler
    neck into which the dipstick fits.

    Remove it again and check the level of oil shown on the
    dipstick. It should read somewhere between the "Min" and "Max"
    marks.

    The 911 uses a "dry-sump" system, as opposed to the "wet-sump"
    system used by most passenger cars.

    In a dry-sump system, the oil at the bottom of the crankcase is
    picked up by a pump which sends it to an oil tank.  After being
    de-aerated (completely) and cooled (somewhat) in the tank,
    another pump sends oil from the tank to the engine.  After
    flowing through the engine, it ends up in the bottom of the
    crankcase again, and the cycle repeats.

    When you measure the oil level on the dipstick, you're measuring
    the level IN THE TANK.  That's why you must measure the oil level
    while the engine's idling; if the engine isn't running, some oil
    will be in the crankcase, and your dipstick will erroneously
    read low.

> Finally, what are the consequences of over-filling the oil?

    In extreme cases, seals can burst.  Don't do it.
