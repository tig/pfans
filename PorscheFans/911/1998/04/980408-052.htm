Hello Bob:

The voltage regulators on the late modle Porsches are relatively easy to
replace.  Most of the time (9/10) the regulator is the culprit when you have a
charging (or usually overcharging) problem with your car.   On the 911's,  the
voltage regulator is held on to the back of the alternator with 2 small blots,
with 8 mm heads.  The regulators are integrated with the brush assembly, so
when you replace them, you kill two birds with one stone.   To determine the
output of your alternator, you merely touch the leads of your VOM to the
battery terminals.   A normal reading will be between ~12.5 - 14.1 volts.   If
it is much higher, you will boil the battery, and that is the "rotten egg"
smell that you encountered.   When refilling the battery, be sure to use
distilled water only, as the minerals in tap water can internally corrode your
battery.   The biggest pain in the ass, is going to be removing the
alternator.  I recently read a posting written by a guy who didn't much care
for this task.   There is no real easy way to get it out.  Hopefully, you or
your neighbor have a 5 or  6-year old kid around, because that is about the
only age of someone's hand that will fit inside the fan housing to get at the
wires.   The cost of the volltage regulator/brush assy is about $45.   I have
6 of them if you need one.    I always carry a spare in my own car, especially
when going to track events, because it is a real drag when they go out.   If
you have any questions or need additional help, feel free to e-mail me.

Good Luck!
