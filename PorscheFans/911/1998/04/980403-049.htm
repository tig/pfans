Hi Tom,

If you just need a standard plastic replacement handle, I have one from
my recent interior work that I would be happy to give away; just send
your address and note which door is affected.

Eric Brown is correct about Automotion's handles.  They are listed as
available in both Porsche crested and non-crested versions ($74 and $56
per pair).  I got crested versions from Performance Products during a
recent sale for about $50/pr.  These are smooth black aluminum, rather
than the grooved surface of the standard handles.  These are both
stronger and, IMO, much better looking than the stock handles.  One note
on installation: have some small tweezers handy, as the two little metal
c-clips are a pain to get on and off.

Regarding manuals, I would go to MY Porsche (www.my-porsche.com) or try
a local dealer for an owner's manual for your model.  Cost should be
under $25 and has a good amount of basic info.  I got mine from a local
dealer for $15 with a 10% PCA discount.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
