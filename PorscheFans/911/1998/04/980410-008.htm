Yes, with no ill-effects whatsoever... forget about leaded fuels

74s are your best bet for a 2.7. They ran  cooler.  Still most people claim the 2.7 motor top end will require more frequent rebuilds than any other 911 power plant. See Bruce Anderson's "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook" for  details. Several PorscheFans report their 2.7 engines are robust and long-lived. If I knew a 2.7 engine was rebuilt properly , I would consider a 74.

I believe they require a full tune-up and service (including valve adjustment) every 6,000 miles. Most people change the oil/filter every 3,000.  If you drive every day this certainly is high maintenance compared to a new Toyota, etc. If you use your car for recreation, it is not bad at all.
