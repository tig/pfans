Folks: My brother lives in Chester, VA and he is considering the purchase
of a used '79 911 located in Woodbridge, Virginia. I'm leaving a
description of said car below. Could anyone in the Richmond area tell me
who's the best independent  Porsche mechanic near Woodbridge, VA? Due to
the modified condition and number of miles on this vehicle (not sure how
the miles are on the replaced engine compare with actual miles on the
body), my brother would like to have it inspected and compression checked
by a reputable mechanic. You can reply directly to me and my brother Tom at
addresses in header. Here's a rundown on the car. Anyone familiar with it
or care to comment on its modifications including the carb setup?  Thanks
in advance, Darrell - 79 911SC Targa
