>> The new Weltmeister "Poly-Graphite" bushings dont fit the way I expected
them to. They fit quite lossely around the spring plate spindles and hardly
fit inside the bushing cups at all. They will go into the cups with a little
help from the rubber hammer but his does not seem right to me.

The catalogs say to file or grind high spots on the bushing but... the
entire bushing seems too big for the cups they should fit in.

Should I expect such a tight fit? Should I grind the bushing down to fit
inside the cups? >>

I put these in a few years ago, and they were impossible to fit in the
cups. I found a crude but effective way to
machine the bushing to fit the cup. I wrapped the chuck of an
electric drill carefully with duct tape, to fit the bushing on it.
Then I spun the bushing against a flat piece of sandpaper
on the ground until it could just fit into the bushing cup
with a bit of force. Just make sure it is not warped or out of round.
If you put it in with too much force (like I did) it will be hard to
get out, you will have to cut it up with drill holes to remove it.

The center of the bushing is more critical as that is where the
lube and movement are. You want that to be perfectly
smooth and not too tight or loose, and greased up nicely.
You said yours fits loosely there - if it's too loose it will
not work well. Note that if you force the bushing into the cups
(a very tight fit like I had) the center hole will become tighter and 
that may be enough for you.

I was not real successful with these bushings but maybe my
experience can help you anyway.

Good luck!
