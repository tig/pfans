As I reported before after dropping my 71T (with a CIS motor) down off =
of blocks from the winter upon turning on the key I heard a loud whining =
noise from the fuel pump. It sounded like it was running dry. The car =
would not start. As suggested checking the large valve under the air =
filter no resistance was felt indicating no fuel was being pumped.

Playing around with it a bit I found that removing the fuel line as it =
came into the engine compartment, draining it, then re-installing it =
caused the fuel pump to regain prime. The whining noise went away, we =
had resistance on that valve, and I was ready to fire the car up.

After trying to start it about 6 times it started to fire and then =
started. The car proceeded to run very rough and would not rev. up. I =
was able to keep it running after about 2 minutes so I got out to look =
into the engine compartment to see what was up. Going to the back of the =
car I first noticed volumninous amounts of fuel spewing from exhaust. =
Looking to the right gasoline and oil were bubbling out of the oil tank =
cap. Observing this was probably a bad situation to be in ( ;-) ) I shut =
the car down. I  removed the oil cap to find it full to the brim with =
the oil/gas mixture.

Called my machanic who had just installed a completely new CIS system =
from the air box up to the tune of $ 2500 last fall. His best guess is a =
fuel injector is stuck open or some type of fuel pump problems.

Any comments on this theory ? Is it possible for the volume of fuel to =
build up with one injector stuck after about 2 minutes running ? Is the =
fuel pump or some regulator shot ? Have I damaged the motor at all =
assuming the seals have not blown out under the extra pressure of the =
crank case being 100% full of fluid ? Will this gasoline wash leave me =
with a cleaner oil path through the engine ?

P.S. To the person who said that the trunk light switch was easy to =
remove a repair I fixed mine in 10 minutes last night. The wire had =
broken off the top of the switch. Now for the door switches ;-)
