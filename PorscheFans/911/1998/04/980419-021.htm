  Hi Bill ..

  You inserts are a composite material and can deteriorate over time due to
temps at the intake port as can the o-rings.  They are sealed in the bore of
the
runner by a single o-ring.  The injectors are sealed in the insert by a
single
o-ring.  There is no rubber boot that I am aware of.  My 83 has none and my
parts and tech ref catalog shows none.  Your experience shows why its
probably not a good idea to try to remove the inserts installed on our older

engines without removing the runners first.  I paid about 35.00 for all
inserts
and o-rings at local P-car dealer with PCA discount.  Enjoy your clean
engine.
I understand a clean engine is worth a lot < g > of undocumented horse
power..
