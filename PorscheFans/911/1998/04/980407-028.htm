First, let me state that the PorscheFans lists are a great resource and
thank whoever it is that sponsors them.  But, I believe that PorscheFans
should look into new software to run the various forums.  Specifically,
they should try the Ultimate Bulletin Board (UBB) software:
<http://www.prime-web.com/compass/ultbb10.html>

I have NO connection whatsoever to the vendor of this software.  I became
familiar with it through the dbsdish.com web site (digital satellite
stuff).  To take a look at it, you can visit this site directly or there is
a link to it at the UBB site.  With 50-100 posts daily to just the 911
list, it is becoming burdensome to wade through the postings looking for
something of interest (YMMV).  There is a better way.  The UBB software has
several advantages over the basic listserv software currently used by
PorscheFans:

1. E-mail is not necessary.  The system is based at a web site and all
postings are accessed at the web site.
2. Registration can be required to post and persistent flamers can be
banned.  Registration info--your profile--can be made available to others. 
This can aid in building the "virtual community" that makes up PorscheFans.
3. It is easy to have multiple forums (e.g., 911, Boxster).  When you
access a particular forum, all that is visible is a listing of particular
thread subjects.  You click on a particular thread to read all of the
related postings.  This is a big advantage over the current method using
e-mail.  All responses to a particular post are in one place in
chronological order.  There is no wading through all postings.
4. Posted threads remain available for an administrator-determined length
of time after no new postings to the thread or they can be pruned by a
moderator as desired.  This means that specific threads (postings and all
their responses) are available for an extended period of time.  Whenever a
thread gets a new posting, it moves to the top of the list of thread
subjects.  If there are no new postings to a thread, your browser
"previously visited site--link changes color" feature lets you know that
there is nothing new in that thread.
5. No cross-posting repeating messages and resultant flames.  No
MIME-encoded blah blah blah gibberish.

Hell, don't listen to me, go to dbsdish.com and see for yourself:
<http://www.dbsdish.com/boards/test1/UltimateALT.cgi>

IMHO, the UBB makes a lot more sense and is a lot more user-friendly and
well-organized than the current listserv.  I haven't researched it in
detail, but there may well be a search feature.  Of course, the need to
search is reduced quite a bit simply by the improved organization of the
UBB forums and threads.

If you visit the UBB web site, you will see that, for non-commercial
purposes, the software can be had for $35.  I think we could raise that
easily.

I'm only posting this to the 911 list and assuming that the site
administrator will see it.  If you are know who the "powers that be" are,
please forward this message to them or to other groups.

Thanks for listening,
Scott Cragin
