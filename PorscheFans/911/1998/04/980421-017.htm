Scott,

I don't feel your extreme position represents the helpful nature of this
list.  It is also a little rude the those of us with C4's.   If the AWD is
so bad, why are all of the turbo's HINDERED by this awful system.  Porsche
must be really stupid or they designed the twin turbo mostly for off road
and snow driving, yeah thats it.  

If you couldn't get the tail out while autocrossing those C4's, something
was wrong.  My wife, in her first autocross/driving school, spun ours
several times and had no trouble with the pitch and catch during the school
and even hung the back out on corners while racing a couple of times (I did
as well).  

While some power is always going to the front wheels (not actually true of
the 964 but it is true of the 993 and Audi system), you can't tell while
driving no matter how sensitive you are until tires start slipping.  Also,
drop clutch starts don't work well in C4's as there is too much traction,
so the clutch slips instead of the rear tires. (again C4's have more
traction).

As far as my 944 and others beating 993's, it happens and is fairly common,
but it is not because 944's or 914's etc are better cars, just better
drivers.  Back to the initial question that started all of this, the guy
lives in Austrailia?? wasn't it, where he probably is not going to be
autocrossing that much and since he is asking the question to begin with,
is probably not much of a Porsche expert so the C4 is a much better and
safer Porsche to learn on.  They will handle WAY better than his driving
ability.  At our autocrosses no one looks more foolish than the people that
show up in their new turbo Porsches and can't even keep them on the track.
As a full time race car I would chose a RS America and be faster than any
993 or C2.

I am just trying to provide helpful information, not my extreme personal
bias.  You should read a lot more about the C4 before making your
statements as much of the info was wrong.
