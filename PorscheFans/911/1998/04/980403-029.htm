Hi guys,

I have a '76 911 and I'm trying to do my own maintenance, etc.  Recently
the sound of the gears in the transmission have increased in such a way
that leads me to think that maybe it doesn't have enough oil.  It just
seems to sound like gears meshing and turning each other without
adequate lubrication.

First, where do I fill the transmission oil from?  I've got the Haynes
manual, but I can only find reference to the drain plug, they don't
mention where to fill!  Second, I've read discussions on the list lately
that lead me to beleive that "Lubro-Moly" transmission oil is the best
out right now?  Can anyone tell me where to get it, and what to ask for?

Any responses appreciated.

Thanks,
