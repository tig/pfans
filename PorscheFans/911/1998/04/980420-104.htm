     Pfans,
     
     I got several good advice on oil cooler removal last week on my -80 
     911SC  I proceeded that far that I found out it being next to 
     impossible to remove the engine schrouds (the one on top of cooler). 
     It seems that I need to either 
     
     1) Remove the airbox, mixture control unit etc.
     
     2) Do a partial drop for the engine as somebody recommended
     
     Now I feel somewhat uncomfortable dropping the engine, since I have 
     never done that.
     
     If I end up removing the airbox etc. does it come out as a complete 
     unit or do I need to remove individual components separately? Is it 
     easier to do this that the partial drop. I guess I better find also 
     out first if it is really the thermostat or pressure sender unit that 
     is leaking, so should I still do the engine drop.
     
     I looked at instructions on engine removal in the manual and there is 
     several tens items that need to be done. I'd appreciate if someone 
     could give me a rather detailed description how to proceed in case I 
     do a partial drop. As I said I feel somewhat uncomfortable doing this, 
     so every advice is appreciated. (I know I have to do it sometime, 
     though!)
     
     Thanks in advance,
