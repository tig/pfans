Dear Fellow Porsche Fans: 

How do I watch for valve guide wear on my '87 Carrera? 

I've been reading a lot recently about how '87-'89 Carreras apparently develop
early valve guide wear problems -- some with only 30K or 50K miles!  Now I'm
worried that my 68,000 mile '87 coupe is destined for the same fate. 

Although my car feels like a champion (it cold starts immediately, idles
nicely, runs strong and has no oil leaks) there IS one tiny, little thing that
worries me: when the engine is completely warm, and I blip the throttle (as in
heel-and-toeing a downshift) I can hear from time-to-time, a small, muted
'pop' (kind of a backfire I guess). The engine never misses under load.
Although the timing seems to be spot-on and the plugs are clean and tan, I
will have the car fine-tuned soon, looking for any ignition-based tuning
problems.

I almost wish I hadn't learned about this problem -- it's taking some of the
joy out of driving my "baby." Am I unnecessarily worried? Is there anything
other than the obvious (Castrol oil, Chevron 91 octane, etc.) I can do to
prevent it? What signs do I look for? 

Thanks in advance!
