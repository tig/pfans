Hi,

I have a wierd one...

I've been keeping my oil level about 1/2 way between the marks on the
dipstick - and have found that my oil level gauge is pretty accurate
in tracking this.

After autocrossing on Sunday, I noticed while driving home that the oil
level was down quite a bit - just at the top of the red on the gauge,
and a check of the dipstick confirmed that I was at the bottom of the 'safe'
area. Time to add oil, methinks. (and HELL - how did I use 1/2 a liter in
one autocross event???!!!)

The car had sat for a couple of hours before driving home, so it was pretty
cold when I left the event, and nicely warm when I got home and checked the
level.

Oil temp never got very high - about 1/3rd of the way up the temp gauge.

On Monday morning, things were back to normal. I was heading out to pick
up some oil, checked the level again, and found it back where it was
BEFORE the autocross!

Any explanation as to why the level showed so low after the autocross then
came back?

Cheers,

Ross
