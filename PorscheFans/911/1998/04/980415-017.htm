Hello all

I too ordered a BAT kit.  This kit worked out well, but was much more of a
"collection of materials" rather than a kit.  There were no hangers for the
oil cooler, nor diagrams of how to make them.  Over all, I made some L
brackets and got things to fit, but I'm not a racing fabricator, and this
was more than I was willing to go through.  I would be interested more in a
930s factory cooler for my new baby.
