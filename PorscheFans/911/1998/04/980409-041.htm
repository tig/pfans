     Chuck,
     I installed a used tank in my '77. I ordered it from Parts Werks of 
     Chicago (800-366-9147) and paid $400.00 plus shipping.  They sent a 
     tank from an '89 out of their CA yard which was in perfect condition.  
     The inside was extremely clean.  I did flush it out with gasoline 
     prior to installation and have not had any problems at all.  If you do 
     get a used one make sure the connection for the fuel pump is correct.  
     I'm pretty sure you need a connector welded to the tank which receives 
     a flared type fitting from the hose to the fuel pump.  The other 
     style, which I believe is older, is a tube welded to the tank and the 
     fuel pump hose slips on and is held in place with a standard type hose 
     clamp.  The return line is the same for both style of tanks.  Hope 
     this helps some.
