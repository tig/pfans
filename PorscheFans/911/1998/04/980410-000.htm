Hi All,
	I have a '78 SC that seems to have typically weak 1st/2nd synchos.
Basically, its hard to shift into first unless the car is near stationary.
2nd is a little easier, but crunches if you upshift or downshift into it
above 3500 rpm.
	Basically, this means that from a standing start, I can only
accelerate moderately peppy.  I can rev from first up to ~4500 rpm, and then
shift into second at the rpms drop to below 3500.  I can't do a first to
redline, and shift into 2nd at about ~4500 rpm. I can shift from 3rd to 2nd
without crunching as long as I'm running below 35mph.
	I've never autocrossed before, but I wonder, with this tranny can
I expect to learn anything showing up on autocross day?  Or will I have
to get a tranny rebuild first?  I don't have to win, I just want to have
fun with it!
	After reading the messages on this list, it seems that 915 behavior
like mine's is typical.  In fact, some people seem to claim that 
downshifting into first will alway be a tough affair with the 915, even
after a rebuild. I know people autocross with the 915.  Are people doing
it with weak 1st/2nd synchros?

-Don
