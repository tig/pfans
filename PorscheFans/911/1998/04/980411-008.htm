Your trans needs help, although it is -common- for the 915
trans to have these synchro problems, it's also normal to
-fix- them when they get as bad as yours. The parts to
do this are worth about $50.00, and the job is possible by
even a modestly skilled enthusiast. You'll need a box of tools,
a pair of jackstands, and a day or so of greasy fun! Failing
that, it's not a big job at your local Porsche shop, and while the
engine is out you can see that the valves get adjusted, etc...
(and while you are there, bigger swaybars, and bushings, and
maybe Webers, an E cam, SSI's, Bilsteins, err........  ;-)
(just kidding, the synchro's will be a big step towards helping
you realize the fun of your car. There is nothing worse than
being at a stoplight and not being able to get the damned
thing into first...)

Don't confuse renewal of synchro's with a rebuild, either. The
synchro's are a simple affair. Just fix 'em!

You'll sure have fun at the Autocross no matter what you bring
(even a Yugo...), and you'll learn a lot. One of the things that
you'll learn is that your car needs some loving attention now
and then. Synchro's are one of the items. 

Have a ball!! 


PS: Anybody see a Yeti driving a Porsche around Portland lately???
