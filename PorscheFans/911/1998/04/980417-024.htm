While I love the new car, its awful quiet. I'd love to make the exhaust sound a
little more sporty. While there have bpinions expressed about the various
systems, this sound thing is very subjective. I guess my first move will be to
go to a track or other club event and see who has what and what they sound like.

This does give me the idea (thinking can sometimes be dangerous) for a project 
to record the various systems (stock, Borla, B&B, Fabiani, Monty and side and
rear muffler bypasses) under controlled circumstances (inside the car under full
1st and 2nd gear acceleration and at constant 60 mph) and post the resulting
sound files on a website (along with spl readings). Unashamed self-promoter that
I am, I would ask the mfgs to loan systems for testing.

Is this a totally harebrained idea or does someone else want to pursue it? Any
other comments?
