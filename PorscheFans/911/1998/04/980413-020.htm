Pfans,

I recently purchased a 1984 Carrera Cabriolet (Euro) and have sorted out
the problems and thought I would let you know about them.

1) Gas smell at times with the top down. O2 Sensor?

2) Shifting tight from 1st to 2nd. Shift Forks?

3) Paraniod about a Euro model. Big Trouble?

On recomemdations from the PorscheFans I took my car to :

Performance Plus ( Porsche Service )
Owner : Mark Schuster - (818) 710-8244
7107 Canoga Avenue
Canoga Park, CA 91303

I had Performance Plus do the 75,000 miles service. I asked that they
take a look at the 02 Sensor and my clutch/shifter.

(1)(2)
After the tune-up the car runs great - with no gas smell. They checked
the 02 Sensor and did not find a problem. Checked the clutch and found
that the clutch cable had be routed the wrong way (not long ago) and was
binding. Had them install a new one, what a difference. 

BONUS - After getting my car in great running order, they cleaned my
engine compartment. It look as though it was DETAILED. It's very
impressive.

EXTRA BONUS - While they could have installed an (O2 Sensor (because I
asked), they didn't. The price for all of the service was LESS than you
might expect for just a Valve Adjustment at other local shops.

(3) EURO Paranioa - I have completely lost my Paranoia of the Euro (Grey
Market) Porsches. I have talked to many people at the Department of
Motor Vehicles (CA), Department of Transportation, Bureau of Automotive
Repair (CA) and they have assured me that my car is legal, smoggable AND
essentially the same mechanically as the US model, with a Catylitic
Converter added on.

Thanks to all the PorscheFans who helped my get through this purchase
and shake down! GREAT LIST!
