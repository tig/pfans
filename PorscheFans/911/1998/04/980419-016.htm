While I agree with Kevin that true carpet adhesive can be used for this
application,
I would disagree that the trim adhesive is a waste of money for the
following reasons:

1) I tried a test of such adhesive and found it does form a very strong
bond, but is quite unforgiving of any placement errors.  In other words,
once on, it is very difficult to do any repositioning without damaging
the carpet.  It also had a tendency to bleed through my carpet (German
black SliverKnit), which is rather thin; this may have been a function
of my lack of skill in using it.  The Trim adhesive is much more
forgiving of any initial errors, yet once it sets up seems to hold quite
well.

2)  I found that very little adhesive is actually required to hold most
of the carpet in place (same is true of the headliner).   Carpet hold
down strips along the doors, seat belt and rear seat back bolts/carpet
screws in the rear, and lateral pressure from overlaid mats along the
wheel wells in front will do much of the work in keeping things in place
given an adequate (though weaker) bond on the carpet pieces underneath.

3)  The only place that may require a really strong bond is the area
under the rear seat pads, which I have not yet permanently placed.  In
this case, strong adhesion is definitely a requirement, as nothing but
the adhesive will hold this pad in place.

As a caveat to my recommendations, I would mention that this is the
first time I have done a carpet set.  Nonetheless, I have found that the
3M trim adhesive has worked well.  It may be that over time the level of
adhesion provided proves inadequate, but in that case I believe removal
and regluing with a stronger material could be accomplished without
damage to the carpet.

Just my experience; YMMV.
