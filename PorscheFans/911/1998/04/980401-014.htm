Many thanks to Al Cabrera for supplying the below link comparing an
Autothority tweaked 993 Twin Turbo vs. the exorbitantly priced 993
Turbo S.  Being a fortunate owner of a 1996 993 twin turbo and always
open to more power, I read the Motor Trend article very carefully.

For months now I've been doing research in an attempt to find out if
adding another 100hp to these great cars is possible - possible from
a standpoint of working with the various OEM sensor and computer inputs
while continuing to offer the high degree of reliability that is part
of the Porsche cornerstone.

I offer the following comments purely for discussion purposes:

Autothority Stage I Kit
-----------------------
Every ounce of research done on this product shows that the current
software contained in the Porsche/Bosch DME is totally overwritten
with Autothority's far more simplistic code.  As I have been told,
the existing knock sensors are nullified which I feel is unwise if
you wish to keep your engine in one piece for any length of time.
From other 993TT owners that I have corresponded with, I understand
that the "Check Engine" warning light is constantly on.  Again,
this kit totally replaces the existing DME and defeats the OBD-II
system, feedback loops, and most sensors.  I haven't confirmed this
yet, but am willing to bet that the car's VIN is erased which is bound
to raise an eyebrow or two if any warranty work is required from an
authorized dealer.

Note in the Motor Trend article two germane points:

One is the mention of racing fuel that was used in the Autothority
car.  The Turbo S ran normal street petrol.  More importantly, no
provision is made for the added heat buildup due to the purported
100 extra horses.  Basic laws of physics dictate that more power
requires more cooling and I can attest to the fact that the OEM
cars get quite warm when driven in a 'spirited' manner.

Weltmeister Black Box
---------------------
This product is slightly better because it doesn't overwrite the
existing Porsche/Bosch software, rather it introduces an ancillary
box that is spliced in to the boost signal after the factory DME, and
simply multiplies the boost signal. There is a fuel pressure regulator
that must be installed which increases the fuel pressure to match.
Best part of this Dinan product sold by the fine folks at Automotion
is that you retain all the factory DME features, including OBD-II,
vehicle ID info, knock sensor control, full sensor feedback, and
altitude correction.  Someone on either this list or the 993 site
has this installed in their twin and they rave about the added
low end torque with no engine warning problems to date.  I still
question the lack of additional oil cooling.


Euro DME Changeout - Tech EFX
-----------------------------
I stumbled upon this top notch company while searching nationwide for
my turbo.  A gentleman named Jeff Korda owns a company named Tech EFX
(http://www.tech-efx.com/index.html) and he offers many custom products
for 993s and 986s cars.  His performance enhancement is in my opinion,
the best to date, although I've yet to see any before and after dyno
data.

With your credit card number Jeff ships you one of his Euro 'loaner'
boxes which you simply install (plug & play) in place of your existing
unit and demo for a week or so.  If you approve of the new performance
gains you send your stock DME to Tech EFX where they in turn deliver
it to Germany for the Euro Porsche/Bosch upgrade.  In roughly 4-6 weeks
you get your original OEM box back that now includes the more radically
programmed software.  Obvious benefits here include the fact that the
work is being performed by Porsche/Bosch which embrace all the stock
sensors, feedback loops, altitude adjustment, VIN info....  and the
original unit that came with your car is back where it belongs.

The same factors still remain to be addressed, that being the true
horsepower added as well as any cooling considerations.


In conclusion I again offer that I'm a financial analyst for a
telecommunications concern and have no ties whatsoever to any of the
above companies.  If I've misrepresented any product, I'm open to mature
dialogue to rectify any incorrect information.  The goal here is to
learn what modifications are out there for twin turbo owners and to
totally understand exactly how the vehicle is affected, both pro and
con.
