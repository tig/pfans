Well I received the car back last week and here were the findings:

1) If you remember I was not able to start the car after it's winter =
storage (71T with a 2.4 CIS). A real high pitched whine from somewhere =
and it would not fire.

This whine was coming from a dry fuel pump. Releasing an air lock in the =
system fixed this (removed the fuel line as it enters the engine =
compartment, drained the gas into a clean jar, and re-installed it). =
Turning the key on you could here the fuel pump fill up and start to =
pump.

Starting the car it ran really rough and I then found the vast amounts =
of fuel spewing from the exhaust and filling up the oil tank. Some =
people felt that may be a stuck open injector. After taking it in, =
draining the oil/gas mixture (which seems to have given the motor a good =
internal flush as it was really black), changing the plugs and setting =
up the points all is fine. The car runs better than ever. No stuck =
injector or any other reason for the massive amounts of gasoline in the =
oil were found. I have put about 100 K's on it since and the oil is =
clean with no gas smell ?

2) I have a question regarding the crankcase ventalation on this car. =
The PO, when he installed the new 2.4, capped off the oil tank breather =
hole that I think is normally connected to a connector on the side of =
the air intake by some type of hose. My question is this. The hole is =
tightly plugged letting out no air. Removing my oil cap with the engine =
running I here a puffing noise as pressure is released. Is this part of =
the system suppose to be pressurized ? I would say no seeing as their is =
a breather. If it is not suppose to be pressurised do you think it would =
lead to oil comsumption or aid in pressure related leaks due to the =
pressure buildup ? Should I go by a hose for this and re-connect it to =
the breather ?
