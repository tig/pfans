Denny, Pfans,

I had to remove my '82's mirrors to rebuild them and they had been hard
wired by the PO.  I went off to Radio Snack and got a bunch of 6
conductor connectors and pins for about $5.  My experience with Porsche
connectors has been basically bad.  You can not just order them.  You
have to usually find an old harness and then snip them off.  This
requires buying the whole harness which is big $$ sometimes.
Personally, I am changing my connectors as I go to all Molex brand.
They are usually cheap and easy to find/use/replace.  Replacing them is
easy because I am rewiring the car as I go.  Don't trust 16 year old
wiring...

My $0.02

-Michael
