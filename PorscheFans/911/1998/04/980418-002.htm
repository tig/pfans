The space is usually called the rear parcel shelf and the brackets are for
luggage straps.

If I remember right first remove the two luggage straps brackets on the shelf.
Then remove the screws that hold the straps that fasten to the rear seat backs.
The long thin piece that these straps were on will then come off. You may need
to rotate it back and forth as I believe it was hooked on from underneath as
well. Once this piece is off the cover for the rear parcel shelf should slide
off.

For a start what is the flat space below rear window called? My question
is how do I remove this? The leather covering on this space is slowly
slipping loose, like shrinking, I want to remove this thing and have the
leather refitted but I have no idea how. I tried removing the two little
brackets but this didn't work, anyway what are these things for? I would
appreciate some help.
