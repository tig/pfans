Hi all,

Looking for some guidelines from the list as to a purchase I just made.  I
bought 4 Koni Adjustable shocks for my 71 911T Targa.  These are the
"Classic" Hydraulic Adjustable type.  The directions say to leave them at
the factory setting for street driving.  I was wondering if anyone had any
recommendations on this?  I mainly use the car for fun trips on the
weekends.  Usually it's just a cruise into the canyons surrounding LA where
I take it as close to the limits as I can.  Should I make the shocks
stiffer or leave them at the factory setting?  I initially thought I would
be able to adjust these in the car, but unfortunatly you need to remove
them to adjust them.  I'd rather not be pulling them in and out 3-4 times
to get the settings right.  Thanks in advance for any help anyone can
offer!

Garth
71 911T
