Vic,

I had the same experience with my oil level gauge.  I found a lose
ground wire on the oil sending unit on the oil tank.  I would check in
the area of your fuel tank sending unit, located on the top of the gas
tank, and look for a lose or corroded connection.

Hope this helps and good luck.

Folks:

The gas gauge on my 88 Carrera began jumping wildly tonight, from the
half-full mark (which is how much fuel I have) toward the full mark ...
mostly appearing when driving on bumpy roads.

In my limited knowledge, I seem to recall that when the wire is
disconnected from the sender, the gauge will go off the scale toward
full
if the gauge is okay ... it would seem logical that I have a wire either
loose on the gauge or the tank. Can someone tell me where to look and
what
to look for?

Also, I'd assume the gauge would still be accurate when it's not
jumping,
correct?

Thanks!
Vic
