Hey Todd,

What was your first clue to the competence of your alternator repairman?

On your car there were two suppliers in vogue for alternators.  Marchal
and Bosch.  We were always warned that when you replace the alternator or
voltage regulator, its brand had to match the other component.  You could
replace both with one brand or the other.  

BTW, I had to replace the fields in a burnt out Marschal alternator from
an SC.  I found that fields from a FORD (Motorola) could be substituted.
I had to heliarc the mounting pads in the alternator case a little bit.
After it was assembled it worked very well.

I hope that all of your projects are going well.
