Hi Lon.  I think I may have heard something similar.  My car makes a strange
sound most of the time, but it doesn't have to do with turning a corner.  When
I release the brake pedal after stopping or slowing, I hear a sound, which to
me sounds like a large tuning fork (and you can "feel" it in the pedals). 
Like yours it's not metal to metal kind of squeal but more of a vibrating
sound.  It goes away immediately when I touch the brake pedal, and having the
clutch in or out makes no difference.  Also it sounds like it's coming from
the master cylinder area in the front trunk.

My brakes work great so I haven't been real concerned with it.  It's done it
since I bought the car last July.  If this sounds similar to yours and you
find a solution please drop me a line.
