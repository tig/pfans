Depends on what is being sold... as they are claiming they are whiter.
- Blue tint & *white*/brighter may mean they are dichroic bulbs.
  The blue tint is just the appearance of the lens when viewed. They do
  not give off a blue light light (the converse).
  If anyone has seen CATZ lights, some of these are like this.
- Blue tint meaning the infamous blue coated bulbs. 
  Run from these, as the light emitted by a halogen light is actually
  very low in blue (relatively) so with a blue coating only allowing
  blue to pass the bulb must be heavily uprated so you can see anything.
  Plus blue-light by being a length challenged wavelength ;) is most
  easily defracted by rain/fog thus appearing less focused or "softer".
  
Basically...
- Use high-pressure Xenon gas charged halogen bulbs. These are 
  about 25% brighter in reality, they do work and aren't a rip-off.
- Uprate bulbs but euro-dip style + relays.
- Get HID, Hella aftermarket HID 4"? unit are 750$US each.
