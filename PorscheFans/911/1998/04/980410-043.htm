Tom - there may be things we get ripped of on, but not especially on the
orange Loctite case sealer.  If I am thinking of what you were thinking of,
the other Loctites are what you can buy at a good hardware store, and
are to lock threads with various degrees of tightness - there is also a
green (called a sleeve retainer) which locks things even tighter, and
ones you can supposedly use even after things are bolted up, and so
on.  Sometimes the colors aren't indicative of the function, and you have
to use the Loctite numbers - I think the after the fact wicking locker is
green, but it is nothing like the green sleeve retainer.  

However, the orange case sealer (in a much larger - about 9 times as
large - and different tube) is different stuff - it is an anaerobic sealant. 
Keeping 911s leak free is hard enough even with the best of the right
stuff.  I wish it cost less, but I don't think its cost is a Porschefactor deal. 
It is what you use when you put your case halves back together, and
when you put your cam carriers back on the heads. 

Bruce Anderson gives in his book as a fine substitute some sort of Dow
Corning 507 sealer? (I may have the numbers wrong) complete with
picture, but I don't recall seeing this advertised in the usual suspects, so
don't know what it costs.  If it is cheaper I might try it.  Using ordinary
Permatex or other silicones isn't a good idea for these applications,
though, or so the gurus say.

Looking at last year's Automotion I see them flogging a new "red" loctite
case sealer for 50% more.  Anyone have any experience with this
stuff?  That catalog also speaks highly of Curil sealants.  Anyone used
these?  The standard orange has worked just fine for me, but I could be
persuaded to be more ventursome.

The manuals tell you to put on a little of this orange stuff and roll it on
with a small paint roller, which I used to do.  However, my local
machinist/engine builder guru told me to put it on directly from the
applicator in a bead (being careful in selected spots) and be liberal. 
Neither of my two race engines have had leaks from these joints
(although they haven't seen high mileage before being torn down either). 

Walt Fricke (who somehow has been building or rebuilding about an
engine a year for the past 5 years since he got into the GT club race
classes, plus work on heads along the way, and has run through a lot of
that orange stuff).
