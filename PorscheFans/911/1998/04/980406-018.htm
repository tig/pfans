The early 911 engines were setup for single weight oils (ie SAE 30, etc.), so the use of multi grade oils is not ideal. The oil pumps on these early cars has a magnesium housing, which expands as the oil heats up. This allows for increased clearance between the mag. housing and steel impellers, thus resulting in decreased oil pressure. The heavier weight oil will help this, but I have been told numerous times "no to worry".


I have used Shell Rotella-T in all of my car for years. It is a heavy weight (~15w40), so it works very well with the early 911 engines. The oil pressure will still be low, but better than with 10w30. The Rotella-T was actually developed as a diesel engine oil, but a friend of mine turned me on to it. I have no complaints since I began using it! It used to be fairly expensive (on the non synthetic side), but WAL-MART and SAM'S CLUB started selling it several years ago, so the price is average now.
