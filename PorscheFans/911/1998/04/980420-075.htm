Hey gang,

My 71T has a combo brake/oil light, which incidently has never appeared to
illuminate even in low oil conditions before.  However, it always comes on
when the parking brake is set.

To digress for a moment, I talked to a guy who told me that he once borrowed
an early 911 from his brother, saw the "oil light" on when it was parked,
and added oil to the tank until it overflowed because he kept waiting
for the "oil light" to go out....

And as long as we are digressing on the topic of early 911 hazards,
a car wash guy told me once that he had to pay for collision damage
on a 911 and the car he backed it in to.  Why?  The 901 shift pattern.
He jumped in, shoved it into "1st" and took off backwards rather abruptly,
crunching the 911 rear end and the front of the car in back of him...

Ah yes, the topic:  My brake/oil light is on now for no good reason.
Oil level, pressure and temperature are normal.  The apparent cause
is that I stopped the car very suddenly yesterday locking up all four
tires.  Since then, the light has stayed on.

Any ideas on how to fix this?  It's a very bright light which is annoying
if not unnerving to look at.

Thanks,

Vol

71T 3.2 CIS
