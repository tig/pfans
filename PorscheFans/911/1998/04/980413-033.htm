FYI From a guy on the Ferrari list


Subject:	My Personal Code of Conduct

Various posts on the list the last few days got me thinking.  During
this
lazy Saturday morning waiting for F1 qualifying, I ginned-up the
following
as a personal code for myself.  I don't intend this for anyone else, and
you have the lovely gift of free-choice to decide on your own about
these
things.  That said, I thought others here might be interested.  As a
code
for myself, I might not always meet the standards I outline.  But I
firmly
believe in self-improvement and all that stuff, so here goes... 

-----

My personal code of conduct as an exotic owner

1) My cars will always be clean and well-presentable. I will ensure that
my
cars are in the highest state of mechanical condition and maintenance.
Exotics as indeed rare, and to see one is a special experience.  I have
an
obligation to present these cars to others at a high standard.

2)  I will always be polite, courteous, and friendly.  I will not talk
down
to or ignore anyone, and I will cheerfully answer all questions.
Exotic
owners wrongly suffer from a "snob" label.  By actively and always
countering this, I will strive to change this perception among all whom
I met.

3) Where feasible, I will encourage inspection and observation of my
cars.
If someone is clean and courteous, I will encourage them to sit in my
cars.
 I will actively encourage photographs.  In-particular, I will encourage
this among younger children.  On occasion, I will offer rides to
admirers
under the appropriate circumstances.

4) With one exception (see 5, below), I will obey all traffic laws or
local
traffic customs.  Especially, I will pass other cars only in marked,
safe
passing zones, and I will always respect traffic speeds and noise
ordinances within city limits.  I will always drive in a defensive
manner
to protect myself and my vehicle.  I will not initiate nor will I
respond
to challenges to race my cars on open public roads.  When asked to race,
I
will positively comment on the challengers car and invite them to
inspect
mine at an appropriate stopping point, while asking if I might see their
vehicle.

5) Operating my cars as God, Enzo, and Ferruccio intended will occur
only
on open, rural routes free of heavy traffic or on appropriately
designated
race courses.  On public highways, I will use my highest powers of
observation and diligence to ensure that I place myself, my vehicles,
and
the public in no additional danger.  I will be aware of the environment
and
road conditions, and I will not drive at excessive speeds on unknown or
suspect roads.  When approaching blind corners or hills, I will assume
that
an obstacle exists and will take appropriate defensive measures. 

6) I will share my passion and excitement for exotic cars with others
through community service and charitable events.  I will actively seek
out
community organizations such as local police departments and schools and
offer my cars for use in events such as DARE programs, homecoming
parades,
pep rallies, etc.  Many communities have "Make a Wish" foundations for
sick
children.  If given the opportunity, I will offer a day with myself and
my
cars to such organizations in an effort to brighten an otherwise trying
life for someone less fortunate than I.

7) I will be honest and open with other enthusiasts, and I will
accurately
represent my cars to prospective owners and buyers.  I will keep
complete
records, and I will always follow-up with purchasers of my cars to
ensure
that they continue to gain maximum satisfaction and appreciation for
cars
that I have owned and serviced.

8) I will always have a smile on my face when inspecting, driving, or
showing my cars to others.  I will never forget how fortunate I've been
to
own such automobiles and I will constantly remind myself that the future
is
uncertain, and that today may be as good as it gets?
