>>
I am contemplating making my '75 911S coupe look like a '74 Carrera RS.
I don't want an exact copy, just the stripped race car  look.(I'm not
trying to pass it off as "the real deal") I was thinking about maybe a
stripped light weight interior. But I don't want the unfinished look. I
was wondering if anyone on the list has ever done this.How should I
finish out the rear without the seats and make it look good. <<

There is a good lightweight interior available, my '73 has it.
It is lightweight "felt" and covers all the interior except the floor
under the seats. It replaces the rear seats with this felt which is glued
down everywhere.

You can also get the lightweight door panels which us a pull
strap for opening the door, they will match the lightweight
interior nicely.

GT racing makes some nice front and rear bumpers and spoilers,
the '74 RS spoiler (like '76 Turbo) is good.

For authenticity the early Carrera rear flares (metal!) should be
used instead of the SC style.

Not much more is needed to make your S into a good RS clone!

<< Also would
you go with the harness bar or the roll cage?(car is stripped to the
bone for MAJOR frame up (pan?) restoration, so its not a big deal to do
either.) >>

How about a roll bar? I have a welded in bar with door braces that go
forward. A cage is not recommended for street use as your skull
will give on impact with the cage. 8-(

<<  I would also like to know if anyone uses headers and megaphones with
resonators on a street car. Noise doesn't bother me.I've done this
before on a different car and if you shift REAL careful, you can avoid
ticking anyone off. Notice any substantial increases?(or decreases?) <<

WAY too noisy on a 911 - the exhaust ports are only a few feet from the
back of the car, not much pipe for silencing. 
Even supertrapps with fiberglass packing are too loud
on the street (for me).
