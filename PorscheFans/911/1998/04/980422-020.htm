Brief note of caution on getting an "auto parts store Group 49 Battery"  --
Make sure that the top of any battery that you buy for your 911 is sealed
and that a vent hose (a piece of plastic tubing that directs the battery's
gas and acid out of the boot and under the car) is affixed to the
replacement battery.

I just paid several hundred dollars to have the rusted battery tray area of
my '86 911 media blasted and rebuilt after the PO-installed replacement
battery with screw-on caps bled battery acid all over its surroundings when
my voltage regulator failed.  The Interstate battery that I purchased to
replace it (under $100 btw) has a "sealed"  cover (the batter is not really
sealed, one still needs to remove the cover and check the levels in each
cell) over the screw caps, which terminates in a fitting that connects to
the above-mentioned vent hose.  In theory, this arrangement should vent the
battery gasses (and acid) out of the car altogether and prevent the acid
from pooling around the base of the battery and eating away at precious
sheetmetal.

While shopping for a replacement battery, my local Porsche dealer offered to
sell me a $150 replacement battery that he told me was supplied to Porsche
by Interstate as well.

So, my advice is to avoid any replacement battery that has exposed screw-on
caps and to immediately and thoroughly clean the area surrounding your
battery if (when?) you suffer a voltage regulator failure.
