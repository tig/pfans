Matt,  I've got a '83 sc coupe that I just had "setup" by Jim Newton at Auto
Associates in Canton, CT. 860-693-0278.  Trusting his vast experience (thats
his shop on the cover of Anderson's updated Performance Handbook)I simply
told him that my (new to me 61,000 mile) car was a daily driver used on the
very rough roads here in Rhode Island, that I was disappointed in the stock
handling, and that I intended to participate in several drivers ed events
per year. The Kardex showed that the car came with Bilsten sport shocks. Jim
used 22mm solid Weltmeister T-bars in front and 30mm hollow T-bars in the
back. He replaced front A arm bushings and spring plate bushings with street
grade Weltmeisters fitted with grease fittings. Turbo tie rods were
installed and one ball joint was replaced.  The car was lowered with rack
spacers installed, aligned and corner balanced.  I expressed my concern with
the 30mm rear t-bars but, he said "trust me".  I asked about swaybars and
Jim said to hold off, that I might find that this combination meets my
requirements without any serious deteriation of the ride quality that sway
bars would introduce.  At the same time I had some new 205/225 DM40s mounted
on the 7&8x16s. Well, when I picked it up for the two hour ride back to
Newport, it was like driving a totally different car.  Much more stable in a
straight line, the back end is much easier to control at the limit, much
less pitch and drama under heavy braking, very little bump steer  and most
important I would have to say that there little to no change in the ride
quality. It feels like a Porsche should - period. I also had him install a
factory short shifter and changed gear lube foe Swepco 201. BIG difference!
Why would anybody live with the 915 w/o those two simple changes is beyond
me. If your in my neighborhood take it for a ride, it will make a believer
out of you.  I drove 12 1981 to '83 vintage Scs before buying this one.
Only one other car felt this good and it had a very similar setup.  I didn't
buy it because it was a cosmetic roach. Buy the way it was a '83 euro coupe
with SSIs (no cat) and a Burch exhaust. My car came with a new cat back B&B
muffler. The euro's exhaust was much quieter that the B&B. It's too boy
racer sounding and you need ear plugs for a two hour ride. I'm thinking
about replacing it with something less objectionable.  Oh yes I learned a
lesson about non factory parts.  I had Auto Associates replace the front and
rear window seals with seals that I had purchased from Performance Products
who assured me that hey were the real thing.  The window glass sub
cintracter that does all of Auto Assoc's work had a bear of a time getting
the seals to lay flat without puckers. It was a mess and in the process they
scratched the rear window buttress.  Jim Newton politely pointed out that
the nos seals were the cause of the problem but that he would make the paint
repair for me.  The windows came out oem seals went in and the paint was
perfect.  I can't say enough positives. It be frustrating for a pro like him
to deal with new porsche owners that think think that they can get a deal on
parts by perusing the magazines. Enough talk.  Good luck Matt.  Call me if
you want any more info. 401.849.1319.
