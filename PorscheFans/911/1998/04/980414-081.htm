First, a rant: This list really needs a searchable archive. I *know* my
questions below could be answered if I could only search through the
archives; I've seen the topics discussed at length over the last year.
Someone not too long ago suggested that we stage a mutiny on this list and
have someone else take it over; on modern listserv software. I'm seriously
interested in putting some effort, and perhaps some resources, into making
this happen. Send me private email if you are interested in helping, either
financially or with resources.

Now on to my post:

With summer approaching and the '88 Carrera out of the garage more often I'm
getting that power itch again. My car is currently completely stock (except
for the Optima battery and stereo). It's also very low mileage (12,500 now)
and is pristine. I do not want a race car, and I don't want to mutilate my
baby, but I would appreciate a few more horses. Everyone agrees that a new
exhaust system will give the most gain for the buck, with a chip coming in
2nd.

That said, what exhaust system do people recommend? It is very important
that the car does not get very much louder than it already is. If it is not
possible to improve performance with a new exhaust system and keep the noise
down at the same time I won't do it. A different note and a slightly higher
decibel level are OK, anything my wife would complain about will be
unacceptable. Also, anything installed must be undoable. No metal work or
permanent modifications are acceptable to me.

The latest Performance catalog lists the Bursch Tuned Exhaust and claims
"High Performance - Low Noise". They also say installation only requires
hand tools. Does anyone have 1st hand experience with this setup on a 3.2
Carrera?

What about the B&B TriFlos? They might be higher quality that the Bursch (I
take it that they are stainless steel while the Bursch are just steel) and
are much more expensive. But what do they sound like?

Regarding chips: are there any to stay away from? (Gawd, a searchable
archive would help here!).

Thanks in advance,
