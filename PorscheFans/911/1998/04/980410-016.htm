In November of last year I purchased my first 911 (71 911T). I made the
mistake of buying out of state without a thorough inspection. The person
who sold me the car was a member of the Porsche club and I new people who
spoke highly of him and his car. I live in Minneapolis and he lives in
Oregon. We met in Montana and made the swap.

The car still does not run even after $8000 of repairs since I bought it.
It was represented as a great condition car that needs maybe a battery and
that is it. Now it needs heat exchanger's and even then it may not run. I
made the mistake of buying this car. Is there anything I can do (legally)
or help I can get to receive some restitution?
