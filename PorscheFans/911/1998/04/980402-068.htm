Fred:  If you do not have power to a fused circuit on your 930, examine all of
the other fuses, even if they do not specifically relate (in your repair
manual) to the blown fuse in question.  In many cases, Porsche will have a
jumper wire that runs and feeds power from another power circuit that may also
be fused. In my experience, I have found that a poor connection at the fuse
block itself is often a source of  failure.  Try disconnecting the feed wiring
from the fuse block and perform a voltage test.    If all of the other fuses
are intact, try feeding the dead circuit with voltage from another.  Be
careful,  and be sure to have it fused.   If the dead circuit works fine when
a known, good voltage is applied to it, then you may have a bad connection,
jumper wire, or circuit.  It is permissible to jump voltage to feed that
circuit as long as you have it fused.  If the fuse blows, then you most likely
have a short in that circuit (a positive wire touches ground), if nothing
happens, then you may have an open (a wire is broken or loose).   If you get
into a pinch, e-mail me, and I will double check the factory manuals for the
correct wiring.
