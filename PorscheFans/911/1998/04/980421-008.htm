     hi , the best way i found to remove even rusted-solid ball joint nuts
     is to use a large pipe wrench that will fit on the out side of the
     ball joint 'nut' and then insert a iron pipe about 4 ft long into the
     pipe wrench handle , then get a friend 'whom you realy don't like a 
     whole lot' to kind'of keep the wrench on , while your putting some 
     REAL force on it , the above works great the only down fall is you 
     will have to buy some new ball joint nuts as they will get a little 
     mangled before they come off.
     
     let me know how it works for you..

          I've purchased the Porsche tool (P280b) to remove the front strut 
     ball 
          joint nut on my '73 911.  After soaking the nut with Kroil 
     penetrating 
          oil for 24 hours, the nut still doesn't want to budge - even with 
     a 
          large cheater on the breaker bar.
          
          Does anyone have experience with removing this nut?  Are they 
     really 
          this hard to break loose?  Any tips?
          
          Also, the next steps are 1.  Removing the tapered pin securing 
     the 
          ball joint to the strut, and 2.  Removing the ball joint pin from 
     the 
          strut?  Any tips on how to make these operations easier?
          
          Thanks for your help, and thanks to the list for answers to my 
          previous posts.
