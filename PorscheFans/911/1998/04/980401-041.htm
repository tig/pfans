Just a couple of things to share with the fans group.
It has been raining in Southern California as many of you will know. Just my
luck because this is the year I rewarded myself with a 1995 993 Carrera 2 in
too cool Polar Silver, it's a rocket and I love it.
1. I am waiting to get onto the freeway behind some cars at the meter light.
In front of me a late model Lincoln Mark applies the power in the drag race
with the guy next to him and spins the (one) tire while going nowhere. The
little import next to him with a third of the power sprints into the
distance. My turn next. The meter light goes green I apply the power and the
limited slip (or is it ABD?) sends traction to both wheels but zounds! The
rear axle is hopping up and down just like it was rolling up on leaf
springs! At least the power is getting down there and the car next to me is
left in the dust (or is that mist?). Maybe my tires are overpowering the
suspension? They are 17" 255/40 Bridgeston SO2's.
2. A quick plug for Reus Systems Ltd. I have just had a stereo installed by
them that is awesome. They are sensitive to Porsche guys with thier
ridiculous demands (no new holes!) and the system with the eclipse head is a
show stopper. Call them at (714)772-7779. They advertize in Panorama. P.S. I
am not getting paid for this but if they wanted to send me some money I
would probably buy more CD's.
