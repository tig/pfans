I've been following the thread on Synthetic, sorry silicone, brake fluid 
and I began to wonder what some generic differences were between the DOT 3 
and DOT 4 fluids.

I recently purchased some DOT 4 fluid to put in the car and noticed two 
boiling point numbers, "Wet" and "Dry."

What is meant by Wet and what is meant by Dry?

I believe (don't have the can in front of me) that the "Wet" boiling point 
for my fluid was around 550 degrees and the ford boiling point was 
something like 572 degrees.  Does this mean I should have purchased the 
Ford fluid to benefit from the extra 22 degree cushion or is there more to 
the story than meets the eye?

Thanks Very Much,
Eric
