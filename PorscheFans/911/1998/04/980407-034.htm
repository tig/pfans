Does anyone have good recommendations on stereo
systems in a 911.  I am getting real close to doing a 
deal with a local outfit.  Eclipse head unit, Eclipse and
Dynaudio speakers and a 12" Rockford Fosgate Sub in
the front trunk area, 2 Eclipse AMPS.  Looking for input
from anyone out there as to what you have done and 
how you have been able to get good bass in your car.

Buddy, 
This sounds like a pretty good setup, with the exception of the sub being =
placed in the trunk.  This is relatively inefficient as much of the bass =
will be lost in the firewall.  As a 911 owner, and father of three, I =
also understand the importance of space, however little there is of in in =
a 911.  I put a JL Audio microsub enclosure witha 8W6 subwoofer behind =
the driver's seat.  It is also removable if I need the space.  I would =
suggest you have the installer put everything but the sub in, and then =
try various enclosures before you buy.  I would try subs as small as 8" , =
10" and the 12" you suggest.  a 12"  sub is pretty big and takes up alot =
of space. (laws of physics also dictate size and power for low =
frequencies)  I would also suggest you try tubes, sealed and ported =
enclosures as each will give a different sound.  Don't buy until you hear =
what you like.  A good installer should let you experiement with a =
variety of setups.

IF you are so inclined, I happen to know someone that has a Z-Box Sub =
woofer  for a 911 that is brand new.  This is a custom fiberglass =
enclosure that replaces the entire rear seat, and houses two 10" =
subwoofers.  It takes up no more space than the stock seating =
arrangement.  email me if you are interested, I think he wants about $800 =
for it.  or call Audio Innovations at 800-892-6430 and ask for their =
catalog.  Rod makes an enclosure for the 911 that houses 2 8" subs.
Best of luck

I am looking for a in-dash CD player to replace an aging Blaupunkt in my
'86 -911 Cabriolet.  Visits to stereo stores reveal plenty of options, =
but
none that seem to "fit " well with the overall look of the the 911 dash.
Some are too shiny, many are gray and not black, others are too fancy, =
and
most  have  green displays that clash with the subtle white on black of =
the
911 dash.  I'm interested in what others may have found when upgrading fro=
m
the original cassette decks.  BTW, Blaupunkt does have a model with an =
amber
display that might be visually acceptable, but it is unfortunately their =
low
end model.  Also, any suggestions on speakers to replace my 6 1/2 inch
Alpine's?

The Kenwood Decks used to have a switch that allowed the user to switch =
the display from green to amber.  I do not know if this is still the =
case.  I have an Alpine head unit with a green display, I think it looks =
fine.
I have preached many times regarding the Boston Acoustics Pro 6.4 =
Component speakers, but they really do sound tremendous.  They fit in the =
911 doors well, and are the best sounding speakers I have heard.

Happy Easter to all
