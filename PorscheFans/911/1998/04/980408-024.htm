In the past I have had two sets of tires and wheels for my car; a set for
the street and another with R compound tires for the track (drivers ed.) and
autocross. I don't drive the car great distances on the street, thus
ultimate tire mileage is not a big concern, nor are noise and ride
significant issues. I do want a tire with more tread than an R compound tire
because rain squalls can come from out of nowhere in this area (Seattle), so
I want a street tire that has reasonable wet performance.

I attend autocross and track events because I enjoy it and want to improve
my driving skill, not because I have a burning desire to be the fastest
person there. Therefor I don't need to have the stickiest tires in order to
shave a few seconds off of my lap time.

Given the above, I am considering one set of tires that I could use for both
street and track. The ideal tire would have exceptional dry pavement
traction perhaps approaching that of an R compound tire. However, this tire
needs to have sufficient tread so that it won't instantly hydroplane on
standing water.

Is there such a tire?

I asked a local speed shop owner and he recommended the Bridgestone RE-71
tire. I know that the Bridgestone SO-2 will have better wet traction, but I
assume that the RE-71 will have better dry traction. Are any list members
familiar with the RE-71? Are there any other suggestions?

Thanks for your thoughts!
