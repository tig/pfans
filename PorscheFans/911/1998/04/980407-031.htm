Hi, Richard,

I purchased a '90 C2 last year, after shopping for almost a year for
an '87 to '89 Carrera. I feel somewhat qualified to offer an opinion
(but only somewhat ;^)...

My understanding is that only a small percentage of the cars needed the
fix. Mine does NOT have the fix, and has 73,000 km at the moment. I would
have liked to have found one that had the update, but I'm quite confident
that my motor will stay dry.

> - What is the fix?

It involves replacing the cylinders (and I believe the heads as well). It's
a MAJOR expense if it needs it and has not been done... but it probably
does not need to be done.

My guess would be yes - it is likely to be ok. I would think that if anything
is done that would disturb the head studs, it might start a leak, but if
it ain't broke, don't try to fix it and it will likely remain just fine
until you need to pull the motor apart for other reasons (a long time off!).
At that point I would upgrade to newer spec parts.

> - How can I tell if the cylinder leakage problem has been fixed? 

Documentation. It's tough to tell by looking (apparantly), but if the
fix has been made, it should be documented in the paperwork that comes
with the car. If there's no history, don't believe the claims, and I
would in fact be much less interested in the car. I bought a car without
the fix and with full history and I feel a lot more comfortable than
I would buying a car supposedly with the fix and without full history.

As to the other issues you mentioned, it is most likely that the flywheel
either HAS been replaced or IS ready to go. This is one item that does
fail on all of these cars. Figure about $1,500 to $2,000 to replace. Again,
check the car's history to see if it was replaced, and if so, with which
parts.

The vent kits for tail light and distributor are cheap and easy to install.
You do need to monitor the distributor to make sure the belt's in good
shape - replacing the belt can be done relatively cheaply by good shops...
Steve at Rennsport Systems (porsche@rennsportsystems.com) recently posted
that his shop now performs this service, at a pretty reasonable price. Check
with Steve for more info - he's a great guy and quite reputable.

Afraid I don't know about the traction control... my traction control
involved stuffing bigger wheels/tires on my car ;^)

My advice would be to drive both before you decide. They're similar
but they are different cars. A stock C4 especially will handle quite
differently from a stock Carrera, and is set up from the factory to
understeer quite a bit. Some of this can be tuned out. My C2 initially
understeered a bit (much less than a C4 would), but with recent upgrades
feels pretty neutral now. I've yet to have it on the track or autocross
so I'll reserve comment on handling under those conditions...

I think a C2/C4 can be quite a reliable car. There are more things that
can go wrong, especially in a C4 with it's fairly complex 4 wheel drive
system, but there are also many many updates compared to a Carrera. You
won't know which you like until you drive both.

You *will* pay more for regular maintenance on a C2/C4 - plug changes,
distributor cap/rotor, etc, will all cost more. I'm personally willing
to pay the extra maintenance $$$ as I do most of the regular maintenance
myself, and I personally think the car's a better car than the earlier
ones...

Cheers,

Ross
