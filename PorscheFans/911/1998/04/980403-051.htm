Hmmm...I may be missing something here. I own a 911 because I love the car,
not the name. Yes, the name has a mystique to it and I enjoy some aspects
of that, but if PCA has to change it's name to "That world-renowned German
sports car built in Stuttgart Club of America" tomorrow, I'll still belong
and I'll be damned if I give up my 911 for "another marque". Porsche was
indeed just a man, but the car is something else.
