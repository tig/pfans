What a joyful moment - I just took off my car jacket.  I am all excited for my
first full season of Porsche driving!  This joy is being tanted by the fact
that I can NOT get two of the same answers for this question - What spark
plugs should I put in?

Porsche dealer - Bosch W3DPO
Tweeks           - Bosch W3DPO
Perf. Products  -Bosch WR5DP
Local Shop#1   - Bosch W5DPO
Local Shop#2   - Bosch W5DPO

The car seemed to run fine when I bought the car last fall - but hey what do I
know, it is my first Porsche!  I pulled out Bosch W6DP (from the previous P
owner).  The plugs were black.  I have no idea how long they were in there.
Is it possible that with the "RIGHT" plugs, that the car will run even better!

Please help as I am at a standstill on this one.  I need to hear from some
'72-'73 911T owners who know from first hand experience.

Thanks,
Jeff

P.S.
Tweeks has 20% off tune up parts (air.oil,fuel filters,plugs, etc.) until
Friday, April 17th.
