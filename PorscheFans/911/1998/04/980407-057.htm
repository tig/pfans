Chuck,
Yes, I too read the 4/6/98 post from Ron H. regarding his experience with=
 the=0AXR700. I have a Euro 2.7 w/E cams and Webers, but I haven=92t had =
a chance to=0Arev it that high yet (only to 5000 for now), but a misfire =
at 7200 engine rpm=0Ais still only 3600 rpm in the distributor; fast for =
points if there were any.=0AMine only has about 300 miles on it since the=
 rebuild. So far, so good, even=0Ain a short but heavy rain. No misfires =
at high rpm or other extra-curricular=0Acombustion w/XR700.

I went to the Crane website yesterday where they sort of explained that, =
yes,=0Arev limiting is lost with the MSD/XR700 combo. I suppose there=92s=
 always the=0Afactory rev-limiting rotor instead. As you know, the window=
ed disk is a snug=0Aslip fit on the rotor. If there=92s concern with it s=
lipping, try laying a small=0Abead of silicone at the joint between the r=
otor shaft and the disk.

Ron H. Added this additional symptom:
<<1)  When I shut off the car, (about 30-seconds later) and would casuall=
y=0Awalk into a gas station, convenience store, etc., the system would di=
scharge.=0A"Holy shit and run for cover, I think I've been shot!!",   No =
kiddin'...   An=0A"Earth shattering kaaabboooom!", and a 5-foot flame wou=
ld blast out of the=0Aexhaust......>>

It seems to me that with the ignition OFF, the ignition module couldn=92t=
 be the=0Aculprit. A guess: There could be some extra fuel seeping into t=
he engine after=0Ashutoff. If carbureted, perhaps the float levels are to=
o high and/or there=92s=0Asome engine heat causing the fuel to percolate =
out of the float bowls into the=0Aintake tract ..... if MFI, perhaps a le=
aking injector. That, combined with a=0Ahot plug or an isolated glowing b=
it of carbon in the chamber could have=0Aproduced that =93turbo-on- decel=
=94 look and feel. A hypothesis for high speed=0Amisfiring is that it was=
 just a bad unit.... electronics and all that you=0Aknow. That=92s why I =
keep my breaker points, condenser and old fashion dist.=0Ahardware in the=
 trunk just in case the car decides to rest on a crowded=0Abridge. I woul=
dn=92t worry about replacing the XR700 optical sensor until it=0Astarts g=
iving you (and me) problems. We did get fair warning though.

Thanks for the update
