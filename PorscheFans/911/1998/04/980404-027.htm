Hi,

Never thought I's be asking this question so soon, with only 26,000 km
on the engine. But I changed the oil today (10-50 synthetic) in my  964
engine and now I get a mild rattling noise during idle. It is not the
"chain in a garbage can" sound, more like a Mercedes diesel.

Question, has the distributor drive belt broken coincidentally, or did I
collapse the lifters while idling it with the prescribed 6 liters as I
topped it up?

Oil pressure is normal. The car runs great, but now I hear the noise at
idle. Is this normal and just my imagination?

Oh, I also removed the bottom pressure relief spring and piston thinking
this was the drain plug (first time for everyting, 914s have their sump
drain on the bottom). I Checked the factory manual for proper order and
put everyting back, but it was a bear threading it against the spring
pressure. could the piston be cocked in it's bore? 

Is this noise common after an oil change, does it go away?
