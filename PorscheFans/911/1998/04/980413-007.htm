I completed the chain tensioner update on Friday night.  It runs with no
drips and no errors.  Here is the short version:  

Monday, drain oil, remove rear valance, muffler, engine valance, air
conditioner compressor and coil (doesn't work, don't need it),
distributor,  air pipes try to save, no luck.  Set motor to TDC as
instructed, do left side upgrade.  Have beer, go to bed.  Elapsed time 5
hours.

Tuesday, Order new set of air pipes from Stoddards, Did right side
upgrade, clean other parts, remove the rest of the air pipes, have beer
go to bed.  Elapsed time 3 hours.

Wednesday, Change plugs, vacuum rodent seeds from number 6 cylinder in
order to get the plug out (seeds from PO).  Elapsed time 2 hours.

Friday, Re-install, engine valance, muffler, rear valance, new air
pipes, fill oil, warm up, check for major leaks, go for a short drive,
drink many beers :-) go to bed.  Elapsed time 4 hours of work, two hours
of drinking.

Saturday, tighten a couple of bolts to stop 2 drips, drive like the wind
on the back roads:-):-):-), check for leaks, all OK.

To summarize, easy process, normal hand tools required, take your time,
follow the instructions.
Now about those 3.2 cylinders and that supercharger.........

Once again thank you to all who responded to my late winter posts on
this subject.
