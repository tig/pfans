>> Now my question -- I have a completely stock 1970 911E Targa that I 
autocross, and I am looking for suggestions on how to spend money (i.e.,, 
go faster). I have a limited racing budget, and I want the best bang for 
the buck. Right now I have Michelin street tires, no front sway bar and 
leaky front shocks. Needless to say, I need to do something. I want to get 
new shocks and torsion bars, a front sway bar and stickier tires, but I 
don't have the $$ to get everything at once.

What do the experts suggest? What is the hot autocrossing/time trail setup 
for these cars? <<

The key is balance and control. I recommend close to stock specs
as it will be easier to drive and nearly as fast as a highly
modified car (my bone stock '72S was fastest in Production class
and only beaten by one car in Improved classes at it's 2 parades).

1. First thing to get are good shocks, Bilsteins or Konis work fine.
Otherwise the car will be daangerous even on the street.

2. Get a good alignment, lowered with 1-2 degrees camber
and zero toe front, a bit in the rear. I like 1.5 front 2.5 rear camber
but will wear the inside of the tires on the street.

3. You will need sway bars front and rear. To start out you 
could use stock takeoff 15mm bars but 19mm would be
better with stock torsion bars. Stock torsion bars will be
fine until you have figured out the rest of the car.
My 23 year old bars worked fine.

4. Now it would be time to get some tires - the best on
stock 6" alloys are 225/50/15 BFG R1s.

Other things to check/replace are rear torsion bar bushings
on the end caps. They get REAL ugly. Don't worry about
power you have enough to beat a 3.2 Carrera if you can
outdrive him.
