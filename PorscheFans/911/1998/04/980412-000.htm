Hello P-Fans

I have a '79 911 SC.  The left-hand door will not lock any more.

I removed the trim (thanks very much to a 'hot 930' P-Fans person who
supplied the excellent detail to do that) and checked around the area
and sprayed WD-40 (anti-corrosion, all-purpose lubricant for plastic and
metal) at the problem area.  Good intentions but nil resulte.

When the trim is removed and that thin plastic sheet peeled back, I can
see the door lock actuator connected to a thin metal rod (thickness of a
wire coat hanger), trying to do it's job.  The problem is definitely in
that area that adjoins the actual locking lug.  That is, it's at the end
of the door, down in there somewhere.  Does anyone have any ideas?  It
would be much appreciated.

Additional info: When I turn the locking mechanism inside to lock the
door there is too much resistance to make the turn and also when I try
to use the key from outside it's the same result - the resistance to the
action is too strong.  It seems like something has slipped out of place
and is now arranged such that any attempt to move it will not work - is
a lever now up against a corner or something?

Thanks
Paul
