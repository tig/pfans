P-Fans,

An interesting note to K&N:  I was at a PCA meeting a few weeks ago
where I was talking to a club racer who drives a stock Euro SC.  As I
have one too I asked a lot of questions.  One thing he said was that (in
his case) he added a K&N and received a nice 6% DROP in power.  Car was
dynoed before and after change twice to verify.  His explanation was
that the entire system must be in balance from intake to muffler.  This
does not mean that the K&N is bad for everyone.  His best advice was to
dyno before and then after any changes to be sure that what you are
doing to your engine actually is a benefit.  

Just a little story ...

-Michael
