Hi

I hope someone can help me, I'm really in a jam. I had my windows removed for a
respray and now we are having a real tough time trying to get them back in.

The front went OK - the shop had lots of experience there ( mostly on my car
:-)

The sides go in OK but the trim keeps pooping out at the top and bottom front
corners.

The rear we can't even seem to get in, although we came closest when we put the
top in first and pulled the cord from there.

Any tips or ideas ? We're starting over again tomorrow but can't really think
of anything new to try. The guy helping me has at least 15 years experience and
owns his own Windshield shop so it's not that he's not knowledgeable, he's just
not done any windows quite like these.

Thanks in advance
Todd Meisner
