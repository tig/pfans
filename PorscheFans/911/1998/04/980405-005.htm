Hi Brian,

I can suggest a couple of things for finding a used 911, both in and
around Maryland.  There are several Internet sources I have found useful
in looking for cars:

The BIG Porsche Link
http://wholesaler-usa.com/rennspeed/por_link.htm
This has info on many Porsche-related topics, including dealers and
sites for classified ads.  Don Rosen Porsche has several locations in
Pennsylvania.  Their site is at www.donrosencomp.com/porsche/main.html
(check the inventory section).

Another useful site is the EPage listings, at ep.com/x/capch.html.
Check under 911 or Carrera.  Some of these listings will have photos.

The PCA Northest Region has a 'mart' section with cars for sale, and
also lists other PCA regions with 'mart' sections.  PCA Northeast is at
www.porschenet.com/themart.html.

Another general source is Calling All Cars, at www.cacars.com.  Or just
use a search engine and look under Autos/Automotive/Buying a car, etc.
and you wil find a large array of possible sources.

Other good options are to look in the classified section of Panorama and
Excellence magazines.  In Maryland, you will find that many really good,
well-maintained Porsches tend to live in and around Annapolis, and the
suburbs of Washington, DC. (Maryland and Virginia) and Philadelphia.
Persons in these areas tend to have income levels which allow them to
properly maintain and/or upgrade their cars with desirable features.
Hunt Valley, Ruxton, and the smaller cities north of Baltimore along
I-83 are other potential areas.

Lastly, you may want to contact Brian Buxton, who brokers cars, is a
frequent and knowledgeable list contributor, and owns a '79 Turbo.  His
email is bebbmi@comsource.net, and he is in Evansville, IN
(812.464.8777).

Maintenance can vary widely depending on the car's age and prior service
history.  Minimal maintenance consists of regular oil and filter
changes, tune-ups and valve adjustment at 15K intervals.  Other types of
maintenance will depend on the particular car you choose; Turbos are
more costly to both buy and maintain and require a little more care than
normally aspirated engines.  Bruce Anderson's advice is well taken here:
Buy the newest car you can afford.

Whatever car you look at seriously, be sure to have a thorough
pre-purchase inspection done at a reputable dealer or independent shop.
This should cost between $150-200 and take 2-3 hours.  Also look for a
car with good (meaning complete) service records.

Hope this helps, and good luck with your search.
