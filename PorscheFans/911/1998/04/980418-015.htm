You're right, all seat belt mounting bolts are 7/16-20UNF fasteners.  A couple
of clarifications, though.  We don't really use that many AN fasteners anymore.
In fact, alot of "AN" stuff is what they call "Inactive for New Design"
(i.e. don't use
it).  We mostly use NAS and MS stuff.  If there is still AN stuff
available, I'm sure
it's fine, though.

Grade 8 is just fine, too.  If you look at most seat belt mounting
applications, the
fastener is actually carrying a shear load, not a tensile load.  Rolled
threads vs.
cut threads are a wash in this case.  Also, the reason for a non-threaded shank
is so that the shear loads are not carried on a threaded portion of the
fastener -
not so that it won't "eat away" at the plates.

Aerospace companies are driven to these exotic fasteners more out of
materials issues than strength issues.  A286 is used alot (since it's a
pretty high strength stainless) but it's not any stronger in most cases than
a good ol' Grade 8 fastener.

Bottom line, if you're installing seat belts, roll bars, etc., use a good
quality
Grade 5 or Grade 8 fastener and you should be just fine.  BTW, never say
"almost impossible" when talking about breaking stuff - we can do it.  :>)
