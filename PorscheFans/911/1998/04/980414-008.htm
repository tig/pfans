Charlie,

The implication from your question is that the car runs poorly on startup,
(runs for a few seconds, then dies) but then does run after warmup, as you
said you used acetylene to search for a vacuum leak.   Since the '73.5 through
'75 cars had no auxiliary air valve, they relied on the hand throttle or
simply holding down the accelerator pedal slightly in order to a.) open the
cold start valve when starting, and b.) provide enough extra air to the
manifold to keep the engine RPMs up with a cold engine.  If the CO is set to
2% to 3% at idle with a warm engine, and it seems to run OK after warm-up, the
hand throttle could be the culprit here.

Just a suggestion,

Jim Williams
