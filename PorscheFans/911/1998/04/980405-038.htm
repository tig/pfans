Fellas:
	I think I might have inadvertantly sent multiple copies of a 
similar message to the list earlier today. My ISP had some problems with 
email... sorry for the duplication.
	Well, I think I found the headlight hi/low beam relay. It was in 
the trunk (luggage compartment) next to the turn signal relay. I'm 
pretty sure this is the hi/low beam relay, but I'm not sure. I tried to 
look in my Haynes manual, but they don't have a wiring diagram for a '78 
911SC Euro. This relay I took out has 4 lugs on it. They're labeled 
L,15,31 and 86. It's black and rectangular in shape. White lettering on 
the case reads - 91161810201 / SSA5051 / 12 volt / 31 l 15. There was 
a blk w/red wire to 31, a grn w/yel wire to L and a brn wire to 15. If 
anyone on the list could tell me if this is indeed the hi/low beam relay 
AND how I can test it (while out of the car), I'd be very greatful. 
	I'm really hoping this is the right relay and replacing it will 
solve my problem of no hi-beams. Maybe wishful thinking! Oh yeah, Can I 
get one of these relays at any local auto parts store or only at PP or 
Automotion?

	Thanks in advance,
	Andy Zimmerman
