Hello Again, 
As of today I have added another 993 wheel and 911 (16X6) to be made
into clocks and offered for sale.
Thanks, 
Don



Hello P-Fans, 

I have made a few Fuchs wheel clocks, that are now FOR SALE.

A must for ANY Porsche Fans,  garage, shop, office, living room, den !

Most wheels are polished and painted to factory look with polished
factory lugs, chrome valve stems and 1/4 tire (Tire cut at the first
tread line, about 2 1/2 in think and mounted on the wheel) Can be had
without tire also. Clock in the center cap. 

Current inventory of clocks........

Factory 2.0L alloys, 911 alloys (15X6 style), C2 wheels (17X7 style),
993 wheels (18X10 style)

May do more type's of factory wheels ??, if these go fast. Should have
picture to email my end of the weekend.

Price: $250.00 plus shipping. 993 wheel $275.00 plus shipping.

I look at it like this, the Fuchs wheels are a beautiful wheels to me, I
just hate to waste them. 

Roll around all your life and if your lucky, you will be a Don's wheel
clock and live for ever on the wall for all to see.....LOL.

Let me know, 
Don
