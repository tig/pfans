Here's my experience:

I switched over in 1995 when 20th Century decided that my '86 911 was a
"Sports Car" and raised my premium to $1400. Leland West came in at $530 under
the 5,000 mile program.

The car was wrecked in July 1996 - when I called Leland West, they told me to
call the insurance carrier. I felt that they didn't want to hear about it,
even when I told them I couldn't reach an adjuster there. It took a week for
the insurance co to respond to my many calls and faxes. (They said that the
adjuster was out of the office dealing with floods somewhere in the east). I
finally called the other driver's insurance (State Farm) who promptly arranged
to move the car from the towing service garage and sent an adjuster out.

The car had been hit from the rear on the side of the road while disabled with
a flat tire by a Camry doing 40-50 mph. Damage included bowing our of the
front fenders from the load transferred through the doors. Both doors still
opened - pretty strong uni-body. 

When I finally made contact with my Insurance company, they told me that State
Farm wanted to fix the car. I told them "No Way, Jose", not to a rear engined
car with a transmission aimed at the crossmember.  At this point, I felt that
my adjuster was on my side and working on my behalf in negotiating. We were
able to reach a equitable settlement. (The concours results from the Parade
sure helped here).

Was this an abberation? If the insurance company only has 1 adjuster and she
is out of the office when you call dealing with tornados in Alabama, for
example, you will have to wait until she returns. 

One last thing - Leland West formerly made an exemption to the 5000 mile limit
for PCA events with prior notification. I just found out that they have
reduced this to 50%. The Parade in Steamboat will certainly make a BIG dent in
my annual allowance.

If you have State Farm, I understand they have a classic car plan, but you
have to beat on some agents to get it. It may be worth a try. Maybe other
companies also offer this coverage. Unfortunately, 20th Century does not.
