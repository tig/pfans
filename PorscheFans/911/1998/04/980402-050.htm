Vic,
  In answer to your 3rd question about squeaky A-arms,
unless they are aftermarket bushings I don't think greasing 
them is going to fix your squeak. I'm not sure that factory 
bushings even _could_ squeak. The rubber bushing just 
sort of flexes when the A-arm moves as opposed to sliding.
(Because I'm lazy I'll repost what I said last time this
question came up.)
  The front A-arms can make a terrible squeak. A few years ago 
the ones on my '86 were doing this after I replaced the torsion
bars with bigger ones. I had heard that the A-arm bushings
wear out so I replaced them. When I got the old bushings out they 
were like brand new. I replaced them anyway - and the A-arms still 
squeaked. 
  It turned out that the torsion bar cap had worn into the cross member
allowing the torsion bar to rub on the inside of the A-arm "tube". 
When I cleaned the grease off the old torsion bars I could see where
they had been rubbing also (but hadn't squeaked).
  To fix, remove the cap, put a little weld on the shiny part (that
rubs the cross member) then file/grind it down so it just fits in the 
cross member. I had a machine shop do the welding part. Someone told 
me they built up the crossmember with weld which is more difficult 
but sounds like the "right way" since that is the part that is 
actually worn. I'm not a welder and the gas tank is right behind
the cross member...
  Except for the welding, the front suspension stuff is really
easy to do yourself if you don't try to remove the A-arm from the
car.
  I replaced the bushings with the Weltmeister "Street Hardness"
flavor and I don't think I even lubed them. Mine don't squeak in 
normal use. The last time I can remember hearing them squeak was 
coming off the track onto a bumpy paddock road. I don't know if 
it was the bumps or the track time that made them squeak.
