Hi John (with copy to Pfans in case you are traveling)

I am "several" hours into the replacement of the cylinder  in back of the
ignition switch (86 911 Carrera), which I am replacing with the hope it will
solve my random problems with starting (goes dead occasionally, then and
hour later starts fine).

I got the lower retaining screw out easily (I could see it), but am having a
very frustrating time with the upper one.  No room, no visibility, no tools
that want to work in that space, etc.  Any ideas??  Imagine it would be
easier  (or at least more comfortable for the time I've spent upside down
with arms under dash) with seat out, but thought I'd try without that.

Also, I pulled the two connectors that run to the firewall, in order to gain
better access.  I thought I was taking care to note which one went where,
and then later, noted there are three receptacles on the firewall and only
two plugs.  One plug is more tightly tied to the main ignition plug, and
goes to the left of the other, I think  Just not sure which if the three
female connectors to use.  Advice is appreciated.

I don't suppose there is any way to remove the entire switch mechanism from
the dash side, and pull out to work on?

Weather worked will for autocross.  Anxious to hear how you did.

Thanks
Ward
