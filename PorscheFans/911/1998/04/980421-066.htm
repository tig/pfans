    Matt:

    You're right; the torsion bar is just an unwound spring -- more
    precisely, a coil spring is just a wound-up torsion bar -- and if
    it's manufactured properly, it does provide a (more-or-less)
    linear resistance.

    As far as I can figure out, the biggest advantage to hollow bars
    (and the reason that they're claimed to "react faster", whatever
    that means) is just this:  It's much easier to heat-treat a
    hollow bar than a solid one.

    It's difficult and costly to ensure that a solid bar's
    heat-treating penetrates all the way to its center.  With a
    hollow bar, the material to be treated is only about one-third as
    thick, so it's cheaper and easier to manufacture, and its
    response is more predictable than a solid bar.

    This also explains why hollow bars are often STIFFER than solid
    bars of the same outer diameter... It's because they're
    heat-treated better.

    I think you mean "unsprung" mass, which is the mass of the
    tires, wheels, and brake calipers and rotors, plus HALF the mass
    of the components (springs, A-arms, and shock absorbers) which
    link them to the chassis.

    Per wheel?  Yeah, you're probably right.

> Saving two pounds on the torsion bar seems like a (2/50)=4% effect.

    Yes, but it's an IMPORTANT four percent... Removing four percent
    from the unsprung mass has the same or greater effect, in many
    of the ride-rate equations, as removing four percent from the
    SPRUNG mass.  In other words, two pounds saved from the wight of
    a wheel is equivalent or better than 120 pounds lost from the
    chassis (for the purposes of those equations).
