Hello P-Fans,

If someone could help with a self-created problem, it would be great!  I
have a 1985 Carerra Coupe that has been a driver since new, with many
winter miles in the Northeast and in North Carolina. When the metal end
that screws into the handle for the engine lid release (in the driver's
door pillar) corroded through and broke, I tried to pull it out from the
engine bay end so that I could do a simple replacement.  No such luck,
the (approxinately) 2 inch long solid metal end on the forward end of
the cable would not make the sharp turn in the tube that houses the
release cable, and it became hopelessly stuck.  Now I can't remove it,
so I can't replace it.  In addition, the engine lid latch is designed to
be open when there is no tension on the cable, so I am reduced to
keeping the engine lid closed with a bungee cord. I have tried to push
the obstruction out from the engine bay side with a stiff piece of wire,
but that will not make the turn, either. As I see them, my options are: 
1)cut the tube carrying the release cable to try to remove the
obstruction.  This option could work, but the tube is heavy guage, and
the space is tight.  2)remove and replace the tube altogether, which
would require cutting and welding a new one in. 3)Keep on with the
bungee cord (not an attractive prospect).

Has anyone had this happen to them?  If so, I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks, and sorry for the length of the message.
