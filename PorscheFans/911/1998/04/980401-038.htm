Hey, hey, cool it, please... We are people enjoying, here, very nice pieces
of engineering and design but, essentially,  "enjoying". The post of David
was skeptical but polite and not insulting anybody, neither Ferry Porsche
nor people on the list.
So don't  indulge in that typical hysterical Internet behavior (sometime I
miss the good old  times when you had to count ten before expressing your
feeling to avoid a big punch on your nose...).
At the same time I have to disagree, politely and friendly, from David. Our
times are becoming, I repeat, too skeptical. Ferry Porsche was a man, yes,
sure, but was a man able to create a dream, a chapter of our time culture,
an entire legend of passion. I think that we are men in a better way when we
are able to have memory and sentiments. I think that, may be, wearing black
ribbons could be a bad tasty manifestation of our feelings (but that is just
an opinion), but commemorate a dream maker remembering him make us something
more that just car owners. Don't forget he was an humorous person, as you
can deduce reading his autobiography and, for sure, he wouldn't enjoy such a
mournful manifestation.

Just my opinion

Aldo
