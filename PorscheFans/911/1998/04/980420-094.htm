I'm guessing that the "95" in your posting was a typo.  It's sure sounds
like your working on a CIS air box which wouldn't exist on anything newer
than an '85 or so.

Don't remove the insert with the small tubes that you found in your new air
box:  It's an upgrade that the factory came-up with to better distribute the
fuel being injected by the cold start valve on the front of the box.  The
two small lines probably went to the EGR valve.  The EPA won't be happy, but
leave them off.  EGR tends to make the engine run hot and a little ragged in
the 2500 - 4000 rpm range.  The 1/2" line could be several things.  I won't
guess which one your looking at.
