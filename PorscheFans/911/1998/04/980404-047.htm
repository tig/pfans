One potential problem with this solution is that some US glass is not cut
to proper dimensions; they are undersized.  I don't know if this is still
true, but it was a few years back.

Had a friend that had a 911 fitted with US glass.  Afterward, he had
the misfortune of spinning the car at a race track driver's education.
When the car spun backward and the wind came in the driver's 
window aimed at the windshield, it just popped it right out!

I have an 88 930T, and have had many other Porsches....all with pitted
windscreens.  Usually, I am a hardcore OEM'er, but I have to admit the
Americans make the hardest glass that I have ever used.  The problem with the
OEM German glass is that it is too damn soft.  I have tried polishing my
pitted winscreens, and the pits refused to go.   My suggestion is that when
you go to replace your windscreen, you try an American supplier.   I was in
the Porsche parts business for a couple of years, and most of the (reluctant)
customers that I referred to using the substantially cheaper imitation glass,
were later inclined to agree with this solution.

Happy Motoring!!
