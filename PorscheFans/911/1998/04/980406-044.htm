Steve,

In response to your question regarding Cabriolet top care.  I highly
recommend you check out this link to the Sacramento PCA club page and an
article on the subject by car care guru Larry Reynolds:

http://www.derporsche.net/cabtop.htm

The article is loaded with good info and based on my experience, I'll
tell you that what he says works. I know Larry gets endlessly plugged on
this list but I don't mind giving him another one.  When I first got my
Porsche I didn't want to get the standard car care stuff from the local
K-Mart so I posted a question on here and a lot of the answers said to
"contact Larry".  So I made the long distance call and it was a great
decision.  Larry took a lot of time to ask me a lot of questions to make
sure I was getting what I was looking for.  It was well worth the cost
of the call as all of his recommended products worked as advertised.  He
also had some very fair prices, especially since it came with all his
recommendations and instructions on how to use them.  I bought almost
one of everything and the order was handled professionally.

Larry's phone is (201) 796-8300 and his E-mail is carcaresp@aol.com.
Even though my post sounds like a lot of advertising hype I'm in no way
affiliated with his business and I've only talked or dealt with him the
one time I placed my one big order with him.
