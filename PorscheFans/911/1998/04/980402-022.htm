Just got off the phone discussing my new 88 Carrera with my wrench, whom
I've known for years and trust implicitly. He recommends a couple of
modifications to the car to deal with the hot Florida summers, and I'd like
to get some feedback before springing for them:

1) He replaces the switch on the front oil cooler fan with one that will
activate it at 210 degrees rather than the stock 250; good idea? It's 1.5
hours of labor and a switch.

2) He recommends changing from conventional oil to synthetic as it will
cool things down and protect better in our torrid summer conditions; the
car has 24,000 miles and doesn't leak anywhere. He confirms that it's
possible I will start leaking a little; anyone had similar experiences?

The car's already reached a temperature of 235 or so idling with the air on
in our lovely traffic on an 85-degree day. It seems to run warmer overall
than my last 911, an 83SC. He sums it up pretty succinctly: the cooler it
runs, the longer it lasts. I, of course, would want it to last.

That's it for the cooling, issue, now just one more thing:

3) The car has what was aptly described here in the past as the "Motel 6
bedspring" syndrome - squeaking at slow speeds; he informs me, without
seeing the car yet, that it is likely the bushings on the front control
arms, which can only be replaced by replacing the arms themselves. He sez
the arms are still good, they just squeak, so rather than replace them
(expensive!) he's devised a grease fitting for the bushings where they get
packed in grease so they stop squeaking. It's an hour of labor plus $2 for
the fittings. Worth a try?

Thanks for all the help you've offered me so far.
