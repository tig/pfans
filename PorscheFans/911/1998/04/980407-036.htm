Hi P-Fans,

I have a true story to share with you.  I live in a rural community in
northwest Colorado, so Porsches are not too common.  This is a land of
dually pick-ups, crew cabs, and 4 x 4's.  Anyway, I was filling the tank
of my Carrera at the local Kum & Go this weekend, when I noticed a man
looking in my direction.  He was a yuppie-looking fellow, mid-thirties,
and was filling up his Pontiac "Wide Body" Grand Prix.  When he was
done, he came over, complemented my car, and then, in all seriousness,
asked me this question:  "Is it true that you have to remove the engine
to change the oil in these cars?".  Somehow, I managed to contain my
laughter and give him a straight answer.

Where do people get these notions??
