My 1971 911E failed exactly the same way. It  seems the starter motor
armature wears in a way that a dead spot is created, If you are unlucky
enough to have the motor stop there it will act just as you say.

Of course any number of intermittent electrical connections - from the
ignition switch to the starter motor connectors could be flaky.

Let us know what you do.
