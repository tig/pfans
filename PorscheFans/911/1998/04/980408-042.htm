Just a note to say I have discovered the cause of my high idle. The
culprit is the auxilary air valve sticking. Proved it by disconnecting
the input line from the intercooler and covering both opening with my
thumb. This caused the idle to drop from 1200rpm to 750 rpm. After
inspecting the valve by shing a torch down the hose I could see the vane
that comes across has not shut off completely. This weekend I will pull
it apart and see if can be repaired. N.B. I purchased the Bosch CIS Fuel
Injection booklet which gave me a reasonable guide to how it worked, but
contains no fault finding tips.

Secondly, thanks to Terry Shugart and Gabriel Pennella for their info on
torque settings for CV joints. Replaced the inner passenger side CV last
night and all clunking has dissappeared. Interestingly the old CV
appeared O.K. to the casual inspection until I washed the grease out and
found it had a lot of wear.

Finally, when I was testing for the CV I removed the brake pads on that
side and ran the car (on stands of course) to listen for the noise.
After this the brake warning light came on and stayed on. Braking
appears O.K. but the light wont go off. I remember there was a thread
regards resetting this light quite some time ago. Does anyone know how
to turn it off?

Thanks in advance

Shane
