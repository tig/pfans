What are the handling or cornering advantages in driving a rear-engined car 
like ours?

A friend was comparing his new M3 to my 993, and naturally talks came 
around to the pros and cons of driving a rear-engined 911/993.  Being 
relatively new to 911 ownership, I'm afraid I didn't represent our cars as 
well as I could have in presenting the pros of the rear-engine 
configuration.

The only pro I could think of was in straight-line acceleration:  rearward 
shift in CG over the driving wheels.

The cons are well known, especially in cornering:  lift-throttle oversteer, 
the inherent dynamic instability in having more mass behind the rear axle, 
etc.

Yet my friend and I both agreed that we've read many times that a 911 
driven by an expert could corner as well or even better than a traditional 
front-engined rear-driven car like his M3.

What information are we missing?  Can any of you who've driven 911's for a 
while shed some light on whether it's actually true that if you knew what 
you were doing you can use the rear-engine configuration to your advantages 
in a corner?

Many thanks,
Bob
