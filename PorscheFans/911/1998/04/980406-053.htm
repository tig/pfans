<<I am trying to put a 915 into my '70 911. I got the clutch problems solved,
the C.V. joint problems solved, and the neccessary dent in the rear seat to
make the tranny fit. My question now is about the shifter. I have a correct
915 shifter but once I bolt it in the car nothing moves. It's like the shifter
is frozen. When the separate pieces are out of the car everything works fine.
Am I missing some bracket, spacer or anything else???>>

Chris,
Congratulations on piecing the upgrade parts together for you early 911. I
went through all of the above except for your shift linkage predicament. All I
can offer are these suggestions:

-	If you can move the trans. shift rail in and out by manually moving it at
the inspection hole in the rear floor, then the problem appears to be in the
shift linkage area. Are the shift bushings under the shifter okay?

-	If the trans. shift rail (the rod sticking out of the front of the trans.)
doesn't move, perhaps the shift forks inside are locked up. Did you try
shifting the trans. before you installed it? You may need to remove the small
inspection plate and see what's going on with the shift forks.

-	Perhaps the transaxle is in 2nd, 4th or reverse and you have adjusted the
shift tube with the shift lever in the 1st, 3rd or 5th gear position. This is
a far out situation, but I guess it could happen.

-	When you created the custom clearances in the seat tunnel to clear the front
of the 915, did you remove the front trans. cover and use this as a guide for
denting? If so, did anything fall off (like a gear, spacer or 3/8" ratchet?)
in the housing before you reassembled it?

I hope it's something really simple. Maybe some others can offer some
assistance. Let us know what you find out.
