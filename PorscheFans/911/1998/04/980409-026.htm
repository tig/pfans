A few 911 questions:

1)  I am interested in buying a '73 or '74 911.  Do they use regular =
leaded fuel?  If they do, given the difficulty in finding leaded fuel =
nowadays, can they either run on unleaded without modification, or are =
there modifications needed?  What would they be?  Can lead additives be =
used, or is that too expensive on every refill? =

2)  I'd like to begin to modify either year to a RS look, I know the '74 =
RSs have SC-like rear flares, but do the '73s have small rear fender =
flares?  What size wheel did it run in back?  AND, if there are any =
ducktail 911 owners out there, does the ducktail make the steering overly =
light at high speed?  More so than a Carrera tail or Turbo tail?

3) For the '74 2.7.  I have heard and read nightmare stories of the 2.7 =
motor on the '75 thru '77 models with the thermal reactors, but what's the =
story on the '74s?  Are they any more reliable than the '75-'77s?  Should =
I steer clear of a 2.7 completely?  How modifyable (<---is that a word?) =
is the 2.7?  If I'm going to make the car LOOK like a RS, I'd eventually =
like to make RUN like a RS.  No turbos or outrageously rare alloys, but =
pure intake and exhaust mods to bring output to around 200-210hp.  Is that =
possible?  How 'bout that '73 2.4 (with a T or E motor)?

4)  I remember my father owned a '72 T, and it seemed to be in the shop a =
lot for tune ups and valve adjustments, given that these early cars do not =
have any modern electronic controls, what are the maintenance schedules =
for the '73/'74 cars?

These are a ton of questions, and of course I have a million more, but =
many will be answered as I research used Porsche books.  Answers to these =
specific questions are fairly difficult to find, however, so I look =
forward to any assistance and advice!  Thanks!
