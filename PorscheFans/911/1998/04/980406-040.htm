Hey List,
I was just sitting here thinking about my car when it is finished.(years
and years)
I have a question. It's a '75 911S coupe, and I was wondering should I
keep the 2.7 and upgrade(Webers, cams, pistons as per MR. Andersons
book) Or should I go with a 3.0 swap? Factoring in cost and reliability
what would be the prudent choice. I'm in no hurry. I just like to plan
WAY in advance. Is hyping up the 2.7 asking for it? 
  It has dilivar studs,rebuilt top to bottom, including pistons and
cylinders.
Also soon to have Carrera tensioners.
  So in closing, what do you think?
 1) Stick with what I have and build on it?
 2) Swap in a 3.0?  

1975 911S coupe stripped to the bone.


Later, Shawn
