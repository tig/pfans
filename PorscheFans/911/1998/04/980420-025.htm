Hello all,

I have just accepted a job in Santa Barbara Califronia and I have a few
questions:

I have a '83 911 Targa.  It is an American car that landed (docked) in
California and was delivered to Alexander Volkswagen in Arizona, where
it was sold and then spent most of it's life.  I imported it to Canada 2
years ago and have kept it stock.  

What are the general rules concerning the importation of vehicles to the
united states?  Since this was originally a US car, do I even have to do
anything at all?  What about emissions?  We have no testing here in
Canada, in fact people use race pipes blatantly around here.

What PCA region would I be in?  Does anyone have contact information for
the local PCA there?

Thanks for your help in advance.
