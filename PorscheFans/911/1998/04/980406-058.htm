Walter, I will try to answer some of your questions and hopefully you can
learn from my struggles...

I believe there is more to this. I asked many people about doing this but
apparently the axles have different splines so you cant swap CV joints nor
can you swap inner axle flanges because the receiving splines in the
trannies are different. Solutions...1) I heard you can use an inner axle
flange from a 930 and this will both fit the splines of the 915 tranny and
it is a bigger diameter so the old style CV joints will bolt up if you
drill out two of the wholes for the dowel pins. 2) I simply used some
complete SC axles that a friend had sitting in his garage. They slid right
in the trailing arms and simple bolted up to the 915 axle flanges. 
3) Somewhere in the early 915 trannies ('72-'74?) there is a large
diameter axle flange that fits the early CV joints and still fits the
receiving splines of the 915. However, you don't find too many axle
flanges lying around to figure out how this works nor do too many people
want to break up a good tranny to sell the axle flanges.

All I had to do to solve my problem was to space up the shift tower with a
few large washers. For one reason or another the 915 shift tower protrudes
further into the center tunnel than the 901 shift tower does. This
resulted in pinching the shift rod against the floor pan.

Not this, the tranny was just proffessionally rebuilt.

FYI, the biggest challenge was to adapt the clutch assem to between the
915 and my old 2.2L E motor. I retained the 2.2 flywheel and aluminum
pressure plate. I got a new SC T/O bearing and clutch disc. I have not had
the car running yet but everything appears to work fine.
