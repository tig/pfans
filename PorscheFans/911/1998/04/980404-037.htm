 As a first time visitor, I will try to keep it brief.
  
  Recently purchased a 75 911 and have been reading everything I can get my
hands on - trying to become better oriented as I go. In several publications I
have read that the middle year 911 models supposedly had a shorter engine
lifespan than 78 on and ever the earlier models. I previously owned a 77 coupe
that was purchased with 25000 miles and never had a problem at all. My current
car has right under 100000 miles. Over the past nine years the original owner
only put an average of 1000 miles a year and kept it garaged most of the time.
  I am interested in any knowlege concerning the 75 year model - especially
advise regarding the thermal reacters - how much hotter should the car run
than models without and is there a popular and harmless procedure to remove
and replace them?
  Also, everything I've read states that all silver anniversary models came
with a dash plaque bearing Dr. Porsche's name. This car did not!  Is there any
way to find out why and could I possibly ever obtain one from Porsche?

  I would appreciate any info regarding this year car.       ----thanks
