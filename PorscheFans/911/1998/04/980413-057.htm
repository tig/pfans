Hi John,

Greetings from an ex-Texan who spent many happy years at UTHSCSA and
along the riverwalk.  I just put new black SliverKnit in my '77 using
mostly 3M General Trim Adhesive (aerosol cans, about $10 each).  Also
used 3M Fast Tack adhesive (liquid, tube, about $6 each) for seams where
I wanted to avoid overspray or get a firm bond in a small space (e.g.,
door pockets).

BTW, if you haven't already got the carpet, I can recommend Original Fit
Interiors (541.679.4460) as a source - great product, great price.

Other suggestions:  Let the adhesive get tacky before placing carpet,
and don't push too hard to avoid bleed through. Don't cut too much or
too soon.  Make sure to fit and refit until you are sure how the lines
will fall with all pieces in place.  It is also useful to save the old
carpet until you are sure how all the new pieces correspond.  The job is
not too hard nor does it take too long (for me, about 8 hours total,
including trimming new door pockets), and what a difference!  The most
important tool for this job is patience, a good razor knife, and sharp
fabric scissors, all judiciously applied.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
