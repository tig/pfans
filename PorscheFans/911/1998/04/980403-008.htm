Well it looked like today was going to be a great day (Friday and all)
until I got in the car (84 911), which ran fine last night but wouldn't
start this morning. Being relatively new to 911s could someone please
provide a list of thing to check given this situation. It turns over nicely
but won't catch. I didn't smell any gas which is a bit surprising given all
the cranking I did (I just couldn't believe the @#$%^ thing wouldn't start)
and yes there is gas in the tank. I didn't have time to check for spark
which is the first thing on my list but I would like to know things to
check that are particular to 911s. BTW I want to shoot this problem
tomorrow (Sat)so please E-Mail me direct because I'm a digest subscriber.
Thanks.
