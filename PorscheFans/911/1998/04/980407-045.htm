Mike,

First off, I got your message through the 911 list so your mail is
getting through };).

I have an '82 Euro SC and had the same questions when I was looking at
buying it.  You need to make sure that it was 'federalized' properly.
Pretty much that is emissions stuff.  There were some strange rules
regarding the color of signal lights and stuff that no longer applies.
Mine has a cat and all the correct emissions crap that goes along with
it.  As soon as I get it inspected (I was rejected for no reverse
lights) I am going to get rid the cat.

I am very happy about getting a euro car as it has more power };).
Also, its kinda neat saying I have a 'Euro' SC.  However, if you will be
replacing parts on it you must be sure to get the correct part.  Several
parts in the fuel system and engine will be different than their US
counterparts and reduce your car's performance.  This I learnt from a
PCA club racer friend of mine who runs his Euro SC.  Also, make sure if
you read anything out of the little spec books that you get the ROW spec
and not the US one.  Several of these numbers will differ.  Ride height
and suspension settings are different than stock US and usually are
stiffer.  But, you will have likely lost this setup when the car was
brought into the US unless the PO has returned the car to its original
setup.  I am planning to return mine to this state after I get my tax
return back!

The other thing to think of is that because of your increased HP you get
bumped one class in several car clubs.  This only applies if you intend
to autocross or club race though.  It's a good/bad thing.  You are
forced to drive better to be competitive, but sometimes you get
frustrated from loosing all the time.  At least thats what I tell myself
};).  Though, the Euro SC and the US Carrera are surprisingly equal cars
and create great competition.

Good luck!

-Michael
