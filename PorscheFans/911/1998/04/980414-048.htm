A couple of things ref this kink of insurance. 

	1. Limted use, restrictive policy
	2. If you use pcar for "driver Ed" events leland west insurance will not
over period.

I have my two pcars insured with them as each is a limited use porsche.
Only claim I had was windshield damage. Repaired with factory glass at not
cost to me. Deductable waived if you use their glass shop.

Company is very good to deal with. You do need to do some extra things to
get insured. NOt sure what they are now. 

The reason the rates are low is because of the limited use program and the
restrictions on use. Plus must have clean driving record. Have to prove
show that you have other transportation.
