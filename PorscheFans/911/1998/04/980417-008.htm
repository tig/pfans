Howdy,

Just replaced my bolts for a harness setup. The bolts are 7/16 NF 20, even in
our metric Porsches. The loop bolts that are standard for harness installation
are the same ( for once everything is standard ). To maintain the swivel
capabilities I had a steel spacer machined - 11mm inside, 14 mm outside, and 7
mm long. All the bolts are different lengths so you will have to remove them
and measure them, just remember to allow for, or subtract for, the shoulder (
depending on what you're doing.)

Can anyone tell me the following hardware sizes (thread dia. and pitch):

	Seat belt retractor bolt to attach to body
	Seat belt B pillar bolt
	Seat belt bolt for mounting inside on the rocker panel area

Car is an '82 Euro SC.>>

Michael,
I don't know the thread dimensions of the seat belt bolts, however the B
pillar bolt and the lower mount anchor bolt have a shoulder on them so the SB
hardware can swivel after tightening. Thus, you probably won't find these at
your local hardware or even metric fastener store. Looks like a dealer-only
part if you're looking for replacements. To make matters confusing, I remember
adding late model ('78) front seat belt retractors to my '69 911 and the
mounting bolt threads (on the body) were SAE! Does my fading memory serve me
correctly? I'm assuming they didn't change the bolt dimensions here through
the years. A couple trips to the hardware store for bolts will probably give
you the answer. Perhaps someone with a better memory (+ a thread pitch gauge
and vernier caliper) could assist.
