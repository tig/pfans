I saw the discussion on towing and thought I would mention something that I
have successfully been using for several years now, and it has made my
towing a lot simpler...

I bought a set of small (3" x 1-1/2") rectangular plates from a shop in
Dallas that had them machined out of +/- 3/16" steel. Each plate had two
holes drilled in it. One hole was to attach the plate to the car, between
the rear shock and the swing arm using the rear shock bolt, and the other
hole was larger and was to allow attachment to the tie down strap. It seems
to work well, it is very simple, and it makes the rear tie down of a 911
just as simple as the front.

These plates could be duplicated fairly easily, or you call the shop where I
bought my set ( Mayo Performance in Euless TX )
