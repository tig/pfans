Don,

How big are the clock hands?  You said in your post that the clocks 
were in the centers, but what I would envision are red hands, 
maybe 4" and 6" long, by about 1/4" wide.  These would be clearly 
visible against the visually noisy wheel background.  Your post 
sounds as if the clocks are very small, contained within the center 
itself.

If they are something like this, let me know.  I would love a 16" 
Fuchs forged five spoke with polished lips, and gloss (wet look 
glossy) black centers.  I have a set of 16 x 7's and 9's on my 
Carrera Cab that were finished as described above.  A clock like that 
would be a great final touch to my garage! (shrine?)
