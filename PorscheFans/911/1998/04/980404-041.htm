Andy, I have placed the pad up under the center of the engine (on the 
flange) and jacked car up that way; used this method between approx. 
'77 and '96 on my '76 and '84 911s.  Just make sure you put some sort 
of pad on the jack plate.  I have used a peice of pine (cracked after short 
time) then a doubled-over section of inner tube.  Have recently switched to
a hard rubber hockey puck which works great.

Have tried it on the 993 as well; only problem is that it bent the engine
undercover screw mount (just a warning to you 964 and 993 owners).

Fellas:
	I know this has been asked probably many times before, but I can't
remember the details.
	I want to jack up the rear of my SC. I can't see a really good place to
put my floor jack. I'd like to put jack stands on each side.
	Can I jack it from the lifting point on the side of the car and put 1
stand under that side and then move on to the other side?
	I just want to make sure I don't damage anything while jacking it up.
Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for asking this
question AGAIN! I can't wait for the abilty to search the archives!

	Thanks in advance.
