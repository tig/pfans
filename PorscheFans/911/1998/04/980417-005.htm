Carmen,

Noticed your post on Mfs/chip install on your 964. I've recently done
the same but am running into cold starting problems with my '90 C4. The
first go it turns over but sputters and dies,  second try it starts but
hunts until I drive off.  After that all is fine.

My mech says my computer is still learning after three weeks, did you go
through the same problems?

Welcome, almost ;^) to 911 ownership. Good choice. I took a similar path
from a chipped 951 to 964 (C4).  The stock 964 was slower at
3000-6000rpm 3rd gear acceleration than the 951.  Adding a Triflow
muffler got this to within 1 sec and adding a MFS/chip got it below my
951.  The weight of the Cab should be similar to the heavier (than a C2)
C4.  I can't give you exact HP figures. Performance equivalency with
bolt on modifications, was my goal. The car idles as well as stock,
sounds better, and throttle response is improved.  There is some lower
rpm improvement (3000-4000) but not below that.  Hope this helps.
