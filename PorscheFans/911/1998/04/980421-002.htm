I have a question about using a car cover in breezy conditions. I drove my cab
into work today with the top down (beautiful day). I've assumed that using my
Technalon Evolution 4 custom cover to cover the car with the top down is a
great way to protect the interior from sun, birds, prying eyes etc without
having to put the top up everytime I leave the vehicle (at least at my
office). But today was also a breezy day. Not strong winds, but a typical
breezy spring day (SF bay area). I watched the cover for a few minutes after
putting it on. Other than it lifting a little bit over the interior (cover is
slack where the top would normally be) it wasn't moving too much and certainly
not flapping. But this evening when I removed the cover, much to my
disappointment, there appears to be a mark in the paint at the top edge of the
windshield "A" pilar rain gutters, on both sides! I can't believe that the
cover moved that much to wear the paint through. It is black paint, so it's
noticeable.

So my questions are:

Is it a bad idea to use the cover with the top down (side windows down too)?

Do other car cover users not use them on breezy days (breezy = 15mph max gust)?
 The cover is very snug, so I haven't been using a tie down rope. Would a tie
down have prevented this?

Being the top corner of the rain gutter, I think I can touch up the marks
without it being noticeable. It's just very frustrating that in an attempting
to protect the car, I ended up doing damage.
