I personnally found Mr. Henderson's diatribe to be uncalled for, rude, and in very poor
taste. 

The death of a person like Professor Porsche is a sad time whether or not someone 
makes the sign of the left-handed ignition key toward Stuttgart every morning. He
was the senior member of a large family and surely leaves a void in their lives. He
led the creation of a large company and contributed to many thousands of people's
lives through the jobs he created. In the case of most of the readers of this lists, he was
a person who contributed to something we value, enjoy, and respect.
