Mat,

Not 100% positive about an SC, but my car ('90 C2) has an adjustable
brake pedal.

Remove the wooden floor board under the pedals and check for an adjustable
pushrod behind the pedal. If you do adjust it, be very careful to not set
it too low - remember that your pedal will go down under repeated heavy
stopping.

Alternately, if your accelerator pedal is adjustable, you can try adjusting
it UP a bit. Mine is, and I adjusted it rather than the brake. If you adjust
the accelerator up, make sure that you check and possibly readjust the
throttle valve stop in the engine compartment, so that full pedal deflection
won't result in a broken throttle stop.

Cheers,

Ross
