Stan,

I'm working from home today, so my car is only 10 feet away...

The kit fits like so:

distributor end of hose fits on the DRIVE (upper) distributor
other end of hose fits on the (4" or so diameter) plastic duct tube comes off
of the heater blower and dumps air into your heat exchangers at the
rear left corner of the engine compartment. The heater duct end of mine is
situated on the back side of the duct, after it bends down, no more than
about 1 inch in a straight line from the edge of the top distributor center
high-tension lead. The right-angle connector goes on the heater duct, angled
so it points straight down in line with the duct. I'm sure the exact position
is not important.

Hope this helps...

Ross
