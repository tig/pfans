Eric;

Dry is out of the new, just opened, bottle.  Wet is after it has absorbed
moisture from the air while either in the car or in the bottle after the first
opening.  There are some specs for how much moisture constitutes 'wet.'  We
should not worry too much about that number as, hopefully, we bleed our brakes
before we get there.

You could have bought the Ford stuff and saved a few bucks and PROBABLY gotten
a better fluid.  There is always more than meets the eye.  In this case, I
think you would have won, though.  Many SCCA and other racers use the Ford
Heavy Duty fluid as it is cheap and has the high dry boiling point.

Remember, synthetic does not equate with silicon.  All brake fluids, including
silicon based ones, are synthetic but all (most) systhetics are not silicon
(only those maked both Silicon and DOT 5.0).
