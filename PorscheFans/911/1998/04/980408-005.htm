Jim,
first off, I am assuming that you are refering to a subwoofer enclosure, =
and as such have couched my response with that in mind.  If this is not =
the case, give me more details and I will change my response.
since I do not have a 944, I have never really looked.  Although JL Audio =
makes a number of "Stealth Boxes" for a variety of cars, I would be =
surprised if they made one for the 944, simply there is not a large =
market for them.  You might check their web site at www.jlaudio.com  and =
see.
Rockford Fosgate also sells premade enclosures for subwoofers, but not =
specifically for any given car.  They have "truck boxes, Hatchback boxes" =
etc... but they are just generic shapes to fit a broad range of =
applications, none of which are specific to a 944.  
The lowest cost way to go is to buy a pre-made box and simply live with =
the looks.  More $$$ will get you a more cusom looking enclosure, but not =
necessarily a better sound.

Depending on how much room you are willing to sacrafice, a good shop can =
build a box for you that will fit in your car.  They should be able to =
match carpet etc... so it will look nice.
An even more elegant way to go (which is a nice way of saying expensive) =
is to have a custom fiberglass enclosure made.  Audio Options in Torrance =
(310) 769-6008 does this kind of work.  it is labor intensive and you =
have to leave your car there while the fiberglass cures (up to 4 days) to =
ensure a proper fit.  It will be a very nice looking piece though. 
Hope I have been of some help.
Keith

Do you know any manufacturers of speaker boxes for the rear
"trunk" area, left and right sides of 944's?

TIA, Jim
