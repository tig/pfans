While I won't comment on your idea, I can tell you about my experience wi=
th
the exhaust.

I've removed the cross muffler in the rear, and replaced it with a S.S.
pipe that has the mounts to make it a "factory look" installation. I'm
quite happy with the results-lower temps in the engine compartment, 35lbs=
=2E
off the rear, and a great sound under acceleration. The best part is that=

while at idle, there's very little notice of an increase of exhaust noise=
=2E

The pipe is available through German Tech in Largo, Fl. Talk to Joe @
800-200-1231

Hope this helps
