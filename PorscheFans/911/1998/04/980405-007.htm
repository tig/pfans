Hi Rick,

Congratulations on your purchase of your '75 Targa.   One thought on
your anniversary plaque issue: make sure the car is a 911S, with the 5th
digit of the VIN begin a '2' (911S/US) or '3' (911S/ROW).  Can't imagine
someone taking this out, but it's possible.  You can check with Porsche
Cars North America (800.PORSCHE) to get the original specs on your car
as delivered from the factory (the Cardex), and to check about
availability of a replacement plaque.

I personally am partial to Bruce Anderson's 'Porsche 911 Performance
handbook' as a source on both the history and maintenance issues
regarding specific year models.  You will find he covers the issues of
the 2.7L engine for the '74-'77 cars in detail, especially issues
related to cylinder head studs and tensioners.  A '75 may also be more
susceptible to rust because it predated the use of zinc-coated body
panels.  You may want to compare the serial number on the engine to that
in the Porsche cardex if you get it to make sure the current engine is
indeed original.
The '75 911S anniversary model is mentioned specifically on page 16 of
Bruce's book (2nd edition).

The issue of thermal reactors is noted on page 72.  If I understand
correctly, these affected only cars meant for California, along with an
EGR system.  Other list members can help you with specifics of potential
replacement.  You may also want to add a more efficient oil cooler to
the passenger side front wheel well, such as a radiator type cooler of
'86-'87 Carrera/Turbo vintage.

Hope this helps, and enjoy your car!
