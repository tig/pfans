I am interested in adding a brake cooling kit to my '95 993, and
was wondering what people have put on their cars.  I have seen the 
kits sold that replace the OE fog lites with a split lite/ductwork.  This
setup doesn't appeal to me, since:
     a)  I have not had good luck with repaints; they always seem to
          flake/chip easier than a factory paint job
      b) Kit does not seem to duct air into eye of rotor
      c) I like power of stock fog lite; doubt if pint-size replacement
          matches it
      c) I'm frugal (cheap?); not quite interested in spending $1000+

I had an Alan Johnson unit on my '84 Carrera that had a scoop under the 
A-arms with a duct to the center of the rotor; this is the type of setup I
would like to go to.  I just haven't seen it offered on the 993, and it
doesn't 
appear as if the kits for other model 911s would fit, due to different 993
rotor
size.Has anybody seen such a kit, or adapted one from another model 
application?
