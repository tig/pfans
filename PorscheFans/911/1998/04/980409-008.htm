I just put one on my car. These are the steps I took:
1. Put some masking tape on the front edge of each fender where the two
studs will go through.  Carefully mark where the studs will go. Center
punch and drill the holes.  Take the tape off.  Put the studs through and
put the nuts on.
2. This next part is tricky to describe.  The holes in the spoiler are
slotted, so you want to mark at the end of the hole closer to the center of
the car so that if you need to stretch the spoiler to make it fit, you have
some lattitiude.  Mark, punch, and drill the next bolt holes on each side.
Bolt them up.  Using big washers here keeps the spoiler from slipping over
the nut as you stretch it.
3. continue this way, one hole on each side at a time, putting the nuts on
to hold the bracket/spoiler, but loose enough so you can stretch the
spoiler if needed.
4. Go back and prime/paint the holes and then repeat the process to bolt
everything up.

Sometimes I found the bolts didn't seem long enough to get a nut on, but if
I put a block of wood on edge under the bolt and then jacked it up a
LITTLE, it would compress the rubber enough to get the nut on.

Having somebody to stretch the spoiler while you mark and bolt it up is
helpful; it's hard to do all by yourself.
