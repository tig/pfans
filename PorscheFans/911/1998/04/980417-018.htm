I have experience with two brands, Stable Energies and Weltmeister. The
Stable Energies bar is very basic and functional. It goes straght across
the car from shoulder belt mount to mount, which in a 911 gives you around
6" of clearance behind the seat. My mechanic said that, for driver's ed
events, you could attach the shoulder harnesses directly to the bar. I
asked him, "How much slower will I hit a wall doing driver's ed than doing
club racing? Enough to not bend the bar?" So, we use dhte bar as designed,
as a guide only, and attached the harnesses to the rear seat belt mounts.

The Weltmeister bar looks much better, and is constucted of larger diamter
tubing sufficient to serve as a harness mount by itself. However, it does
not fit a Targa (bitter experience teaches). It is also better finished
than the S.E. bar, and sits further back in the car.

Hope this helps.....
