It finally got nice enough here in up state NY to pull my '79 SC out.
While it was up on the rack getting new D40's put on yesterday, I
noticed an oil leak where the #6 cylinder meets the head. It was on the
entire underside of the cylinder, but seemed to be concentrated around
the seal. When I got it home I did a compression test and it was fine.
What gives? How could oil be leaking from it, yet it still has a good
enough seal to have the 2nd highest compression? Any ideas?

PS NY was nice enough to start visual emission inspections this year.
Does anyone have an air pump with bracket for sale cheap, in any
condition(as long as the pulley turns). Oh well, at least they did it
BEFORE I plunked down the money for a SSI type exhaust sys.
