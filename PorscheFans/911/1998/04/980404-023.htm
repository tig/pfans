Here's my standard post on this topic......

Very common problem.  Some people have reported that the plastic
guage face warps inward and thus occassionally rubs against the
needle.  In this case, the needle stops moving, but the Odometer
still works.  If both speed and odo fail, then most likely it's
the speedo sending unit beginning to die.
 
The speedometer sending unit is an inductive pickup sensor
inserted in the driver's side of the transmission case just
above the rear wheel half shaft.  The wire from the sensor
runs up over the tranny and into the center tunnel by
the shift linkage where it plugs into the wiring harness
with a standard tongue type connector.  You can reach
this connector through an access panel to the tunnel located
under the carpet between the footwells of the rear passenger
jump seats.  This whole repair is relatively cheap and easy.
But, it is somewhat dirty as any under car engine area work
is (lots of road grime and caked oil).  Here is my recollection
of the tools/parts needed:
  - New speedo sensor/sending unit (~$35 ?)
  - 10mm socket to remove the sensor from tranny case
  - philips screwdriver to remove tunnel access panel
  - about 1 hour to do it
That's from my fading memory, so there's no guarantee of
accuracy.  But, I know it wasn't difficult.
 
Keep Porsching,

I got an 88 Venetian Blue 911 Coupe in October and love it but have never
posted anything before...My speedometer stopped today, as well as the
odometer for about 10 minutes, then turned back on.  Any ideas on what to
do?  BTW, I find this list incredibly informative, and have even met a few
neat, very helpful people who were very willing to give of their time and
information.  This is not what I expected when I first got my car.  I am
truly amazed!
