> 	David:
> 		Great info on the different options on getting more performance from
the
> mighty 993TT. Your concerns about augumenting engine cooling vis a vis
> increased thermal loads by increasing engine HP substantially can be
> addressed easily.
> 	I sell 993TT Turbo S oil coolers, Imported drectly from GERMANY, that
are
> a simple bolt-on unit that includes everything. Its simple and beautiful-
> Braided lines with every small nut and bolt with yellow cadmium plated
> banjo bolts for a  OEM look. This system keeps your A/C intack too. Adds
> 1.5- 2quarts of extra oil to the car. I added one to my normally
aspirated
> 1995 993 and watched the temp fall. Perfect for all 993s any and all
years
> and only $850. I installed the system on a Saturday afternoon.
> 
> 	You know the Turbo S was very competitive to the Autothority car in
> Motortrend. It was not right to have that car on RACE GAS and the factory
> car on regular gas. Pretty easy to dial up the boost on the Fuzzy logic
> boost controller from Greddy or HKS. I know and sell 993TT exhausts to
> several bigtime shops in the Northeast and Northwest that have used all
> these kits 1st hand and then others and have added my $650 993 TT
exhaust,
> lifetime warranty versus 2 years from competitors 100%t304 SS, and have
> made rockets out of these cars.
> 	You are very fortunate- there is nothing like a big Twin Turbo on the
> boost...
> 
> 	If I had a Speed Yellow Twin -I could  finally dispose and 'CAP' Rafael
at
> Club Races and DE simply, effectively, and reliably.
> 
> 	FYI:  Several of my customers in Germany informed me that Auto Motor Und
> Sport mentions the model year 2000 996 Twin Turbo will have some 528hp
with
> 19" tires for $105K... unbelievable!  We should see it stateside in late
> 1998 or early 1999 a manager at PCNA confirmed to me yesterday.
	putting my deposit in tomorrow...
