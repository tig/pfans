Fans,

I have a 1987 coupe.  It is at its factory ride height for the North
American Market.  I would like to lower it to Euro specs.  Can anyone that
has the experience with this facet of modification let me know what
measurements I would be looking at?  I assume it is measure from the fender
to the ground for both front and rear wheels?

Also, I heard the front is easy (less time consuming than the rear).  If
there is the collective wisdom out there to offer me some educational
background on this matter, I would really appreciate the education.

I know I require an alignment and was hoping to do it this season, however,
if I proceed to get the car lowered I will hold off until the major work is
done.

Thanks for your reply,

Joe
