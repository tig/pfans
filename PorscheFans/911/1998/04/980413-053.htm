Steve,

Is the top new? When a new top is installed this typically is what =
happens. The top will drop down to within 1/4" to 1" of the seat area =
and maybe off to one side or the other until such time as the top has =
adequately "stretched out" (this can take from several weeks to months =
depending on how much you keep the top down and how tight the top is). =
You can manually assist it into place while depressing the control =
button in the top up position without harming the power mechanism. The =
top can otherwise be adjusted quite simply and if the top was used =
without the cover (snap on boot used to cover the retracted top) =
misadjustment may be your problem. Driving with the top down and no =
cover allows the wind to shake the top into misadjustment and to =
prematurely wear the canvas out. Check for fraying at the pressure =
points where the canvas is stretched hard against the frame (e.g. along =
the side window seals). Fraying, discoloring or premature wear indicates =
that the boot cover was not used (much). I always drive (except around =
town) with the cover in place to preserve the life of the top.=20
