I'm back again -- this time in the midst of a tear down -- hope I can get it
all back together.  I have removed the air box, and sure enough, there was a
cracked portion.  I have the part and am ready to reinstall, but I have a
question.  The lower section of the new part has an insert with small tubes
running to the center of each intake connection.  The old one did not.  Should
I leave this insert in, or remove.  I will be disassembling the box to install
a pop-off valve.  I also found three vacuum type lines off in the back -- one
appeared to be completely disconnected (@1/2 inch round and 1 foot long -- two
other real small lines were there -- disconnected).  I am assuming that these
were disconnected for a purpose.  The car was running fine before I blew the
box.  I don't see any connections for these.  I am running headers.  Any help
would be appreciated.

Just out of curiousity, I had to remove the intake tubes on the right side.
Is that the proper procedure?  Thanks.
