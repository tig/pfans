I thought you'd enjoy this tale of a 911 that refused to
start, and how we managed to troubleshoot and fix the problem.

Symptom: One day the car simply died. I coasted to the
side of the road, and restarted. No other problems.
About 24 hours later, exactly the same thing occured.
The third day was worse. It died three times in about
as many hours. The fourth time it died, it refused
to restart. Had to tow it home.

Suspected cause: Well, I've known of other 3.2 Carreras
that acted precisely this way when the cylinder head
temperature sensor failed. I assumed that was the
problem. Then, after I realized I couldn't even see
the sensor to replace it, we decided to see if we could
bypass it. There's only 1 wire going to the sensor,
so the circuit is either normally open or normally
closed to ground.  Well, the car wouldn't start
in either state, so we began to think perhaps it might
be something else.

Process of elimination: we found out I was getting good
strong spark. And in all the test firing, no one could
smell gas. That made us think: fuel. Maybe the fuel
pump was bad. The Haynes manual says you can test the
fuel pump by running a jumper wire from another fuse
to the fuel pump fuse, and turning the ignition on.
We did that, the fuel pump started whirring. I started
the car, and.... it started!  We removed the jumper wire
and the car died immediately. Aha! But now what?

Narrowing the cause: Ever try to follow the wiring diagram in
a Haynes manual with aging (over 40) eyes? Ouch.  Anyhow, 
after following the circuit from the fuel pump, 
we decided that the most likely culprit was the DME relay,
located under the driver's seat, next to the DME computer.
We removed the relay, took it out of its case, and had a look.
Nothing looked abnormal. We reconnected the relay to the connector,
and watched its operation as the ignition was turned on and the
engine cranked. Both sides of the relay activated. Back to the
circuit diagram. No other obvious suspects that we could troubleshoot.

Eureka!: Relays are notorious for failure, so we decided to
troubleshoot the DME relay itself...checking voltage in and voltage
out. But both relay contacts were operating properly, so we really
didn't know what we were looking for, except for something odd.
Using a voltmeter, we were able to see that on one relay, after the
contact closed there was 12+ volts making it out to one of the connector
pins. On the other relay, after the contact closed, there was ZERO voltage
to the proper connector pin. 

The fix: We examined that relay closely, and the one among us with
the least impaired vision noticed that one of the solder joints
on the small relay circuit board had come loose. We soldered it up,
put it back in the car, and ...... it started!


The funny part is, the one among us who did most of the
thinking had never worked on a Porsche before!
