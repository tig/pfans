My guess is you won't have trouble re-importing it into the U.S.--most
pollution control inspectors look for the ID plates for U.S. specs.

You could have California problems though.  Since your car is probably a 49
states version, you will have to pay a significant fee so that politicians
will have more money with which to buy votes.

There's a new pollution inspection scheme here (exempt are cars over 25,
and under 4 years) repeated every two years.  I think you can count on
having to take at least one full day off to visit a fully ordained
inspection station.  You'll lose more time if you don't pass.  If your car
is identified as a "gross polluter" you may have to scrap it.  At least
"my" mechanic won't touch a gross polluter.

There are several PCA regions around here--including a Santa Barbara
region.  Check http://www.pca.org/pca/home.htm or http://www.sb.net/david/
