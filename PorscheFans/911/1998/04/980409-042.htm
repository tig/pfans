Hey people...guess what?  I drove into my garage last night, turned off =
the car, and got out only to here what sounded like a waterfall...  =
Looked under the car and saw "GAS" leaking all over the heat exchangers! =
 I quickly backed off from the car and watched for a bit.  The gas =
subsided and quit running.  Turned out, upon inspection after everything =
cooled off, that my fuel line ruptured right at the fuel filter, and =
leaked out what fuel was in it all over the place.  I simply cut an inch =
off the line, and reconnected it, and my problem is gone.

How close do you think I was to "blowing up"?  Gas all over the heat =
exchangers can not be too good an event to happen?
