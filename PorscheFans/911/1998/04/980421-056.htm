Thanks to all that responded to my question!

Snap-On apparently has a 6mm "triple-square" socket that will work.  
(I have to measure my bolt again carefully).  Another guy told me to just
use vice grips to twist them off.  If this doesn't work (I think I remember
trying this),  I'm going to pay the $17 (part FTSM6B?) to order that socket.
Someone else also mentioned a "Lisle" toolkit that may do the job that
may be available at Pep Boys,  I'm going to check again tonight, but I'm 
pretty sure I scoured the local Pep Boys for stuff.

The trim piece is kept in place with the same kind of plastic snaps that
the door trim is held by.  Just lever off with a thin flat screwdriver or,
if there is no clearance,  a putty knife.

Hope this helps!

-Don

     Don,
     
     Did you ever get an answer from the list on this question?  I hav  the 
     exact same issue on my '82, in addition to which I'm not sure how the 
     trim piece covering these two bolts on the driver's side is removed.
     
     Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
     
     Mark Sides
