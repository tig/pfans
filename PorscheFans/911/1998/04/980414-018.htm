Konstantin,
thank you for informing us about Oschersleben. I'm afraid that Porschefans
have an opposite attitude than Ferrari listers, caring very little about
Porsche racing results, at least on the list... My opinion was formulated on
the basis of the report on GT Racing Online Magazine and i'm very happy to
read from you that things authorize to be hopeful about the rest of the
Championship. Le Mans should be a huge event. I planned to go there but
rates charged by Porsche Club von Deutschland (official organizer for
European clubs) are so crazy (3900 DM per person) that I abandoned the idea,
since now is too late, and I'm too busy, for a DIY organization.

Vielen Dank

Aldo
