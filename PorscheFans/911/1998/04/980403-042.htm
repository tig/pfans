Saw your post on the list and although I have never heard of the device
you mentioned I would suspect that it may be something like the
Rec/drier cooler that was awash in controversy last season or so. These
things do not do what they claim and the main benefit that you recieve
is that your system is now fully recharged and works better than it did.

The most benefit you could get from any single item that can be added to
your car's a/c system is the Static Condenser that is mounted under the
car and adds substantially to the condenser area that you car has. This
and a set of Barrier Hose to stop the seepage of freon through the old
hose and your car can be as cool as a Toyota or any other car for that
matter. 

Call Dianna @ 714-634-9184, she can sell you the parts and recommend a
qualified shop in your area to do the installation and recharging. BTW
don't go for a substitute for the real thing, insist on Freon R12.
Nothing works as good!!

You can ck my web site for more info.
