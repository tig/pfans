>> 
I have recently purchased a 73 911E and it seems to be running rich. Is
this problem I should be concerned with?. And is there anything that can be
done outside of having the MFI adjusted? How will this affect the performace?
<<

Here is some VERY basic info that can get you on the right track.

The MFI can be adjusted by removing the small allen screw
on the pump and adjusting the rack with a small screwdriver.
The long MFI tools are easier to use than short tools.

However the failure mode of a pump is running rich
and then they can not be adjusted right.
When pump is failing and very rich they will run but 
your oil will get contaminated with gas and smell bad,
and your plugs will be black.

Hopefully your pump is OK and an adjustment will
get it right. When you adjust it too lean you will feel
surging/missing at low throttle acceleration, then you can give it
a few clicks richer and should be in the ballpark.
