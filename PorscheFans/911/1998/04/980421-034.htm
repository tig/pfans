Jad, I am giving my opinion of the C2 versus the C4. It may not be the
same as your's, but is not any less valid. I don't like how C4's feel. On
the street they are okay but I would still MUCH rather have a C2. If
someone wanted a Porsche for street driving AND some autocross or big
track driving, I would recommend STRONGLY against a C4. Again, the only
time I would want a C4 is if I lived in an area where inclement weather
was the rule. You consider this an extreme postion, but It does not seem
that way to me. 

I would very much like to see Porsche make a 2wd 993 Turbo or a 2wd 996
Turbo. Please note that the 993 AWD system is far better than the 964
system as far as I am concerned. It is less intrusive or less noticeable
in "normal" conditions.

Oh, I could get the tail out. It just took too much work and scrubbed off
way to much speed to be useful. This is not a problem with the C2. Jad,
trust me, I know how to autocross a 911 under control or aggressively. My
experience suggests that a C4 is about .5 to 1 second slower on a typical
60 second autocross course. That is an enternity!!

I am 90% sure the mechanical system in the 964 had a greater percentage of
front bias by default as compared to the viscous system in the 993. I'll
get the details and post them.

As I said, and it appears you agree, put compentant drivers in both cars
and the 993 will win every time. Don't bring 914's into this, They
regularly spank 993's.....

Jad, a C4 is better and safer? Please! I just don't understand this. The
days of tail-happy 911's ended in the '70s. The 964 and 993 C2's are fine
cars that will not bite a new driver. It's time this falicy be stopped!

I happen to disagree with your "helpful" information. I consider your
opinion to be as extreme as mine. But that's what makes the world go
'round!

Well, no, much of my information is not wrong. I may not have all the
details in front of me, but I will get them and post them.
