For your reference, the metal parts on mine looked great.  Still had the

waxy protectant so the brass-alloy still had green-yellow tinge and
all.  But, the rubber was dry and externally brittle.

My suggestion to you is... bend the rubber hosing around, folding
it back on itself in a couple places.  If you see any small cracking,
then replace it.  If it looks pliable and smooth, I guess you're OK.
All I can say is I'm personally aware of 4 other Carreras that have
had this failure.  So, be careful, it's a potentially disasterous one.

Keep Porsching,
