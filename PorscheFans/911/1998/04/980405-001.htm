I had a new 1975 Silver Anniversary Coupe.  They came with a small numbered
plaque with Porsche signature with sticky-tape backing for the owner to mount
on the dash.  There was no relationship between the serial number of the car
and the number on the plaque.  Porsche-Audi merely sent the dealers a bulk
mailing of the plaques in small envelopes for each car Silver Anniversary car
they received.  I still have mine somewhere in the original envelop never
"installed".  Except for the attractive cloth interior (and the availability
of opening rear quarter windows...a great idea unfortunately dropped but
greatly improving ventilation), there was nothing "special" (it's already a
Porsche!) about the car.  They were actually "cheaper" (in terms of MSRP) than
the prior year model.  Authoritative numbers on annniversary cars seem to vary
from about 600-1000 of the total of approximately 4200 US version 911's built
that year.
