Yes, you can change the cooler w/engine in car.  A better way, IMO, is to do a "partial 
drop"; eg. remove axles at trans flanges, loosen or remove parts in engine bay which 
restrict movement, then drop it 6-8 inches.  You will gain amazing perspective and some 
extra elbow room.

Don't know...maybe someone else can answer.

Heat exchangers rarely remain air-tight, what with vibration, corrosion, flying debris, 
etc.  Usully the first breaches are around the edges where the exchanger meets the 
pipes.  Wouldn't worry too much, unless problem continues after you've repaired cooler.
