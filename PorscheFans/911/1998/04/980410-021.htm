This is one of those stories where you make a minor adjustment (in fact an
adjustment that you don't really need to make) and BANG its broken.  This is
one of my more serious mistakes.  Hope someone might know the answer.  Without
going into the long details I broke both transmissions for the conv. top on an
88 Cab.  Inside the transmission there is the main ring gear.  A plate is held
onto the ring gear with some sort of rivet that looks like it was actually
part of the forging process.  The plate moves the arm for the top as the ring
gear moves.  I sheared off all of the rivets.  As the ring gear moves, the arm
does not and the top does not move.  The transmissions are over $400 each.  It
seem to me that I can just realign the plate and spot weld it to the ring
gear.

I know this is a strange one, but someone out there had to have broken this if
their top jammed going up or down.  Thanks for any help.
