I had similar problems on my '86. The problem was bad dog teeth on the
1st/2nd slider (and worn syncros). It was over $500 just in parts. I did the
r'n'r and a retired p-club member did the trans for  a nominal labor fee.
This is a $1500 job if you take the car to a shop.

Or it could just be a linkage problem, which would be an order of magnitude
less expensive to fix.

BTW, I am using a new mailer. I expect this email to go out to the Internet
as plain text. If it gets formatted as HTML, would someone please let me
know? Thanks!

Hey P-Fans!

I have problem shifting into 1st and 2nd gears on my '79 911 SC.
Sometimes it grinds...I reclutch and it goes in fine.  Other times it
just does not go in gear all the way.    What steps should I take to
resolve this problem?

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
