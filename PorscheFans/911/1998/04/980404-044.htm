Can't give much advice on seats, but be VERY CAREFUL with the 
Allen head bolts mounting the seats.  They're very easy to strip, as
I found out this weekend when I was installing a cross-bracket to
hold my submarine belt.  Use a top-quality 6mm Allen wrench 
or socket, and if it won't break loose with a moderate amount of 
force, back off.  I stripped the heads of two bolts; had to drill them 
out.

1995 993 (8-way power seats)
-----------------------------------------------
(reply to:)

I'm looking for suggestions on a competition seat to replace my stock
power driver's seat. My 993 is a daily driver, but I attend 12 -15
Driver Ed events per season. I'm looking for a seat that will work well
at the track, but also reasonable for daily use (i.e. getting in/out
numerous times daily). My built is average and the car already has 5
point harnesses installed. So far I've focused my search on Recaro,
Sparco, and OMT models. I thought the Sparco SRD might be a good choice.
Any comments on it, or any other suggestions? I have no heavy leanings
toward any one of these vendors, just looking for a good fitting seat.

How about comments on self-installation. Is the removal of a 993 power
seat a major challenge? Thanks.
