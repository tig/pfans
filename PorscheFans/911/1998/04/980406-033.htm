Hi, Jim,

More than glad to!

I got the car back on Friday. This may sound funny, but I'm not sure
if I should be happy or not ;^)

Actually, I'm both happy and a little concerned (stress 'little').

Happy because the car feels fantastic. I would HIGHLY recommend this to
any C2/C4 owner. The car is much flatter, both in roll and pitch (dive/squat),
turns in faster, feels more neutral, and is NOT too low for me to worry
excessively over speed bumps, etc.

The springs I used were the H&R Turbo/RS America lowering springs. The
car should be about 1.3 inches lower than stock. The springs were CHEAP
when I bought them (a month or so ago) - advertised for about $170US.

Some of this handling improvement comes from the tires - I also upgraded
to 17" 993 Cup wheels (9" and 7-1/2"), with Dunlop SP8000, 225/45 front
and 255/40 rear.

Now the slightly less happy part... I just measured at the fender lips, and
there's some moderate discrepancy... what I get are:

front right - 25"
rear right  - 24"
front left  - 24-3/4"
rear left   - 24-1/2"

The car was aligned & corner balanced after installing the springs. I know
that the fender lip measurements are only a rough indication, but the
difference in some of the measurements seems extreem. When I get a chance,
I will measure from the suspension pick-up points - these SHOULD be the same
on each side. The car has never been hit, so bodywork should be fairly
straight. Whether a 1/2 inch tolerence side-to-side is normal or not,
I don't know! I'll report back to the list...

Cheers!

Ross
