Nathan:

Changing the oil in your 915 trans is relatively simple.  The biggest
annoyance is going to be transferring the the oil out of the new container
into the trans.  The filler hole is capped by a 17mm Allen type socket, and is
located on the upper left side of the trans.  You should have a magnetic drain
plug, so be sure to clean it well. (carb or brake cleaner works fine)  The 915
trans have some ( I may draw criticism for saying so)  relatively weak points,
especially, the second gear synchros and  hubs.   

A good, simple way (not perfect) to tell the internal condition of your trans
is to drain the old gear lube into a clean container.  Then, take a strong
magnet and slowly swirl it about a 5-10 mm below the surface of the old gear
lube.  If you notice a metallic looking "milky way" following the magnet, your
trans noise/problem may be more intense than just fluid loss.  You can e-mail
me with what you find.

Note:  The oil fill plug (17mm) may be very difficult to break loose.  I don't
recommend heating the trans case to help free it.  The softer alloys of the
trans case will certainly crawl out with the steel plug if the case is heated
too hot.  If you feel the need to heat it, make sure it is not much, as the
"acetylene wrench" can become the "Acetylene Frankenstien" .   A breaker bar,
some Wheaties,  and a few "cuss words" usually gets the job done.

Good Luck!
