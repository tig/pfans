I've used both Redline and Swepco. Shifting was about the same - balky when
cold. The Redline was perhaps a little better when cold, but I live in
Southern California where what we call cold isn't to the northerners.

The Swepco is not a synthetic based oil but has lots of extreme pressure
additives. Under racing conditions, it requires changing more frequently as
the petro base breaks down. I doubt that street use comes remotely close to
these conditions.

There are several Red Line products - make sure you use the GL-5 rated 
one, as it is needed for the differential, which is running in the same oil.
