Brian,

I contemplated putting fiberglass RS front splitters on my lowered 993. =
I even took delivery of the parts from MA Shaw.

After one look I realized that these glass parts were going to last =
about two seconds on my car. And I was right!

But the story is not all bad.

I sent the parts back to MA Shaw before painting and installing them.=20
To the credit of MA Shaw they accepted the parts return and charged me =
no restocking fee.

I then purchased the Porsche poly RS splitters (at three times the cost =
of MA Shaw's glass).

I had the poly parts painted and I installed them.=20
About a week later I scraped the %@&$ out one of them and exerted enough =
pressure on it to break off one of the mount tabs inserts on the bumper =
(an insert into which the splitter mount tabs fit).

However, I only needed to repaint the splitter and remount it to get =
back to perfect.=20

If the splitter had been fiberglass the force would have cracked it, I =
would then have had to buy a new one.

The moral. Don't be penny-wise and pound foolish especially with a =
Porsche
