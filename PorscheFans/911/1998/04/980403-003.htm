I'd be interested in reponses you get to the chip/exhaust and tire
questions if they aren't posted.
My '87 is lowered and has 7x16 fronts, 911 offset with 225/50.  The outside
edge of the left tire has scrape marks from the fender, which had its inner
edge trimmed (rolling the lip is preferrable).  This left-side interference
is fairly common.  I can see rub marks on the left and right inner fender
from the inside edge of the tires.  (All of this seems to happen at full
lock, which isn't an issue on the track.)

The rear has 8x16, 911 offset with 245/45.  No problems here.

I definitely like the look, but I'm real tempted to go with the above set
up for the track and go back to stock on the street, or at least find a
better front set-up.

Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance book is a handy reference here.

Subject:  Need Chip / wheel recc





I just bought a super clean non-sunroof 87 Coupe which I wish to make
limited upgrades to.
 - No chip currently.  Who's is best? Only engine mod will be a cat
bypass (unless advised otherwise).
 - I want to keep Fuchs but wider.  How wide without rolling fender
lips.  Can high offset 7's (944?) fit in the front and 9's in back?
Should I  keep the 205/225 relationship or go to 225/245?
Car is for street only, no track. Autocross only when other needs work.
Just looking for better street handling and appearance.  Thanks for any
input.
