I had the same thing happen with my 1996 993 C2 coupe last year. While
driving I noticed some whisps of white smoke inside the car coming from
the upper area of the rear window. The defroster was not on. The smoke
disappeared in about 5 minutes and I thought I had a short in the upper
brake light or the window defogger. I parked the car at my office and
about an hour later an employee who was standing next to it ran in and
reported that the window exploded. 

The dealer said that they had seen one other like this and felt it was a
defect in the defroster circuit which caused a short and overheating of
the glass. It was replaced under warranty. They also inspected my front
winshield and found a corner that showed delamination (cloudy area) and
replaced that at the same time. Seems that they were told by the factory
that this was a problem with one of their glass suppliers. I would push
them on this and see if they won't pay for it.
