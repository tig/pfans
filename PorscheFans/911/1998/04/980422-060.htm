 "As far as I can figure out, the biggest advantage to hollow bars
    (and the reason that they're claimed to "react faster", whatever
    that means) is just this:  It's much easier to heat-treat a
    hollow bar than a solid one."

Not correct.  First of all, heat treating is a process.  Control of
temperature, quench rate, and tempering times are process control variables
that must be controlled for any item heat treated.  The difference between
the hollow section and the solid bar is less significant than proper
process control.  Both shapes can be properly heat treated, and neither one
is particularly difficult.


"This also explains why hollow bars are often STIFFER than solid
    bars of the same outer diameter... It's because they're
    heat-treated better."

Not correct.  Steel has an elastic modulus of 29 million psi regardless of
alloy or heat treatment.  Therefore, for the same DIAMETER, a solid bar is
stiffer.  For the same WEIGHT, the hollow bar is much stiffer because more
material is located away from the center, and therefore exerts greater
restroring force when the bar is deflected.

 "Saving two pounds on the torsion bar seems like a (2/50)=4% effect.

    Yes, but it's an IMPORTANT four percent... Removing four percent
    from the unsprung mass has the same or greater effect, in many
    of the ride-rate equations, as removing four percent from the
    SPRUNG mass.  In other words, two pounds saved from the wight of
    a wheel is equivalent or better than 120 pounds lost from the
    chassis (for the purposes of those equations)."

Huh?  Low weight is good, and low unsprung weight is even better.  But
saving 2 lbs of unsprung weight is as good as saving 120 lbs of sprung
weight?  What is the basis?  All weight affects power-to-weight ratio,
which affects acceleration.  Unsprung weight affects how well the tire can
track bumps without losing contact with the road.  No way does this
arguement make any sense to me.

I am glad to see a thread here.  I need to rework the rear suspension on my
1970 T, and I am putting in aluminum banana arms.  Who sell the hollow
torsion bars, and how much do they cost.  Does anyone make a hollow sway
bar?

Look forward to seeing some discussion.
