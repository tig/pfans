Hi All,

I have a 73 Targa with a 2.7 from a 77 I was on a long drive last night =
and noticed a developing hesitation at low rpm (3k) once I got into =
higher RPM the hesitation went away.  I'm thinking it might be the gas I =
bought because the hesitation developed 5 min after I filled up.  (at no =
name gas station).  The car sputters at around 3k rpm thru every gear.  =
Also this morning when I went out to start it up it took a few cranks =
before it started and once it did the car sputtered and hesitated  and =
then died.  I started it again and had to keep the pedal down till the =
car warmed up.  Once warm the car did stay running but still had that 3k =
rpm sputter.  Does this sound like bad gas or do I need something else.  =
I'm sure I'll have a few responses and I thank you in advance for your =
help

Regards
