Hello --

Friday morning I awoke to discover that my '70 911E Targa
had been hit while parked outside of my house  :-(

My guess is that a drunk driver used my car, and maybe some
others, to help steer themselves down the street via the
"pinball" method...

The drivers-side door is completely caved-in with moderate
paint damage and extensive sheet metal damage.  I do not 
yet know if the window mechanism or anything else is damaged.

I have $100 deductible comp coverage w/ State Farm and they've
paid my claims quickly and fairly in the past; however, this
time I am wondering if I'll have trouble convincing them
to pay to replace/reskin the door properly.  I do
not want any bondo on this car!!!

Plus, there's no chance anyone could match the 14 year
old faded metallic paint, so I believe the entire car
will need to be painted.  I was planning to do it anyway
when I scrounged up the $$$, but I can forsee a potential
battle w/ State Farm on this one!

Any advice or insurance success stories would be greatly
appreciated!  How does one convince insurance adjusters to
fix classic Porsches properly -- or is it even a problem?

Please cc: to my private email as it's tough to keep up with
the digest sometimes.

Thanks,
