IMHO,

I suggest using only the Porsche Motorsports Euro lowering springs. =
Other springs are too stiff and lower your car too far, for most =
practical purposes - particularly with 18" wheels. I did a lot of =
research before putting Euro lowering springs on my 993 C4. Note that =
there are different Euro springs for each model car. You must put the =
right springs for your car. My local dealer was going to sell me what =
they had on the shelf  and I don't think that they knew there was a =
difference. I found the best price and knowledge from Winward =
Performance. =20

I am not totally familiar with the running gear on the C2S but if you =
have the sport shocks great if not don't bother buying them. They are =
too expensive for what they are (Monroe shocks in disguise) and they are =
not the same shocks as come on the 993 TT. Wait for Koni to come out =
with approved shocks for the Euro springs (as we speak no one but =
Porsche Motorsports makes shocks for the Euro lowering springs - Koni =
did for a short while and quit when they couldn't get Porsche official =
approval for the product). There is some great discussion about turning =
down the shafts on the rear stock shocks to fit the shorter springs =
(turning down the diameter of the shaft allows the lowering of the =
spring seat to fit the shorter length of the spring). I did it as a =
precaution (about $100 for both shocks). Is it necessary?. If you have =
the factory sport shocks it is not necessary.

You should also stiffen your sway bars (22mm front 20mm rear) this makes =
a bunch of difference -  to me. I don't think your stock fronts are this =
stiff but your rears may already be 20mm (again my unfamiliarity with =
your running gear). I suggest the Porsche factory sway bars. You don't =
need adjustable aftermarket sway bars - ask your self how often are you =
going to get under there and adjust the bars. And can you tell the =
difference - not except at extreme settings -  I think. Buy the bars =
from your dealer (best price I found).=20

You will need to align the car after changing the springs. When you add =
the sway bars realignment is not necessary. I added the springs, drove a =
little, then added the sway bars. My local dealer is a rip off on =
alignment charging $450. The guy all the independent shops use around =
here (Marin County, CA) charges $120.  A special alignment gauge is =
needed to align these cars (993). Make sure the shop you use has this =
tool and experience in aligning these cars.=20

Note that if your running 18" wheels as I am you should roll your fender =
lips (front - particularly and rear highly recommended).

If you want prices I got on these products and services e-mail me =
privately and I'll look up the receipts.
