Todd,

Just went out to look at my '77 to see what might cause this problem
(sunroof panel is currently out).  On mine, the 'squareness' of the fit
of the sunroof panel is assured by two factors: 1) that the guides are
properly seated, and 2) that the cables, and thus the attachment plates
connected to them on either side of the sunroof cavity, are equidistant
from the rear of the cavity.

The guides themselves are set in a fixed location by a hole which fits
over a white post (about 1/2" diameter) that is part of the metal bottom
of the sunroof cavity; this post is not movable and thus the guide
should always stay in a fixed position.  Likewise, the removable portion
of the guide rail should be fixed by its location relative to the screw
holes into which it is attached.  Neither removal of the sunroof panel,
the removable guide rails, or movement of the longer internal guides
should alter these positions.

That leaves the cables themselves.  I tried moving these and they will
not budge (as one assumes they should not when the sunroof is not being
operated!).  Given that your sunroof worked before, I would try to
determine if anything you did moved these cables; seems unlikely but
possible, or maybe they were loose to start with.  You could try
measuring the distance on both sides between the rear of the cavity and
the mounting plate on the end of the cables.  If these distances vary,
that would seem to be the problem.  Adjustment of the cables is
possible, though it is not something I have done myself, nor is it
normally necessary when removing the sunroof (famous last words!).  The
adjustment process is described in the Haynes manual, Chapter 10,
Section 15.  If this is the problem, you might consider replacing both
cables while you're at it.

The only other, and least likely, possibility would seem to be that the
seals themselves are not of equal thickness across the front and/or rear
of the sunroof panel.

Hope this helps, and let us know what you find.  Good luck!
