I have been waiting five weeks for gun-drilled 22 mm front
torsion bars from Glen Sander Engineering.  I was told they
were "the best".  This must mean quality not service.  Every
week I have called they have told me the bars will be finished
"next week".

I would like to get them this week to have them in time for an
upcoming weekend event.  Could someone suggest an alternate
source for gun-drilled torsion bars that are of high quality?
Is the only other option the Sway-Away bars?  Are they ok?

Thanks
