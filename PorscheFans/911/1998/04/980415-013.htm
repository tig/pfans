Could well be #4 above as suggested on the List previously

A "natural" attrition, based upon some kind of culling stats?

Who knows?

All that aside, the List is outstanding with 50-60 or more to-and-froms
every day. It's very busy and it benefits all of us - I recently saved
more than $100 by using the advice I received from the List and I say
thanks for that.  And, more importantly, I gained the experience of
having done the job myself which is worth more than the dollars
involved.  There is the therapeutic value of having performed the
mechanical act of effecting the repair and along with that comes the
simple day-to-day value of the feeling of competence.  It is this
competence which emanates and generates a reciprocal action which then
yields, sometimes, advice to others which is given freely and without
prejudice.  We may well have an excellent international executive daily
workshop in progress without realizing it's true value.

Boys with their toys I suppose.  And girls too.  (Not too many boys mind
playing with girls and vice versa.)
