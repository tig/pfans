Dan Smith wrote about a stiff clutch in an 85 911.  Not sure if my recent
experience applies, but it was an uncanny experience worth passing on.  I
recently had a throw out bearing fork failure in my 84.  This started out as
difficulty shifting into 1st and notchiness in the higher gears.  Adjustment
yielded temporary relief, like 5 blocks worth.  Eventually the fork cracked,
resulting in throw out bearing squeal and loss of any clutch action.  Anyway
when I took the gear box to my local independent repair shop, Sam Shalala
the proprietor told he had seen about a dozen of these and in fact had a
Carrera in the shop with that very ailment.  Three weeks later I was in
Sam's shop and saw an other Carrera with the same failure.  All three of
these cars had 100 to 150 k miles on them.  Sam's theory, when the factory
wrench smacks the barrel pin into the fork to hold it in position on the
linkage shaft, they miss the mark and the result smack on the fork induces a
stress riser.
