I got mine from stoddards.  i suppose if you don't use them, water will enter
the control arms, and corrode the t-bars and control arms.  could make for a
very low-riding 911!

Subject: Front Torsion Bar Seals for '72

Hello All,
    I have a question for the group. I recently went trough the effort
to replace all the buschings, and ball joints and tie rod ends, etc.
Basically rebuilt the front end.
    I have a '72E, which originally had foam washers behind the end caps
on the rear of the arm. I have talked to a couple of vendors, and to a
couple of Porsche dealers here, with no luck finding them.
    I believe they are intended to keep grit and dust out of the A-arm
shaft. A mechanic a Zim's said he would not bother with them, but that
just does not seem right.
    Anyone out there have any ideas? Do you think these should be
replaced?

Regards,
Eric
