Tim,

Anyone that claims 30 lbs of torque improvement by switching to SSI's on a
3.0 liter motor is blowing smoke a place the sun don't shine! 

Call Galen Beiker at Werks II (818-845-2530). He has been down this road
about 200 times and will be able to get you what will work best. Just make
sure you explain to him that the autocrossing performance is more
important to you than overall top end power. His prices are good too. 

Tell him I sent you...

Yes, going to a larger diameter pipe will hurt low end torque.
