Tim, it's been about two years since I sold my '84 Carrera, and my memory
is terrible, but here's what I might suggest:

1) check all fuses.  Can't remember right now if the fuel pump and 
Motronic box are fused, but is worth a try.

2) check the multi-pin connectors at the Motornic box (under driver seat)
and at the air flow sensor (top of engine).

Good luck.

Well it looked like today was going to be a great day (Friday and all)
until I got in the car (84 911), which ran fine last night but wouldn't
start this morning. Being relatively new to 911s could someone please
provide a list of thing to check given this situation. It turns over nicely
but won't catch. I didn't smell any gas which is a bit surprising given all
the cranking I did (I just couldn't believe the @#$%^ thing wouldn't start)
and yes there is gas in the tank. I didn't have time to check for spark
which is the first thing on my list but I would like to know things to
check that are particular to 911s. BTW I want to shoot this problem
tomorrow (Sat)so please E-Mail me direct because I'm a digest subscriber.
Thanks.
