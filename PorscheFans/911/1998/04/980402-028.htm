Thanks to all those who replied for all the input.  What I have found after
about 15 miles of driving with the power tube is:

1.  The car is a lot louder around town and while excellerating. 

2.  The sound is a much deeper rumble.  Kinda rough, mean and racy,
unfortunately to my ear there is a touch of Camaro in the sound, but
definately a big improvement unless you are going for a very poor attempt
at Lexus noise levels.

3.  The car is faster and smoother, BUT I believe most of the increase came
from replacing the secondary plugs and adjusting the valves, which were
both done at the same time as the tube was installed.  Don't know if 1, 2
or all 3 increased the power.

4.  It is very easy to switch back to the other exhaust if I decide to be
quiet or take a long drive, so I think it is worth the $250 and would
recommend it.
