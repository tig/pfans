The early 911s had a sway bar which literally went through the body. 
They went in the void area at the top rear of the gas tank, and stuck out
into the wheel wells.  The bushings which supported them were in
carriers bolted to the inner fenderwell sheet metal.  Arms stuck forward
of the bars, and links dropped down and attached to the top of the A
arms.  

At some point ('74 with the advent of the 2.7?) Porsche changed to the
under car kind of bar you have on yours, and the Carerras have.  It can't
be adjusted, and I've never seen anyone advertise a larger one you can
just pop into its place.  The aftermarket bars mount like the early bars did,
which means you have to add some stuff to accomplish that on your car,
although if you had an earlier car you'd have less work to do.

Fortunately, Porsche doesn't retool every time they change something,
so your inner fenderwell has a vestigial stamped place for the bushing
holder, and it is pretty easy to figure out where it should go. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't also have the hole for the bar or nuts welded on
the inside to hold the bushing holder.  So one part of the job is getting
these bushing holders - the ones which hold the sway bar itself - 
affixed to the car.

 Weltmeister used to sell  a  kit, which literally had U bolts to
allow you to attach the bushing holder to the car without having to get at
the inside of the fenderwell, which is hard to get to because the gas tank
is in the way.  It was a piece of Pferdscheiss.  Bruce A's book has a
picture of how one failed, but the true mystery is why anyone thought it
would ever work.   While Automotion should be ashamed of ever
carrying that U bolt deal, they don't any more, and now they offer a good
looking part - they sell a backing plate with nuts welded to it which they
call their front bar improved adapter.  They also sell something they call
the U tab kit, but it is not the old bad thing, it is what deals with adaptation
#2 - attaching the drop link to the A arm.  Good pictures of this stuff in
their catalog.  

So here's the deal:  Position your bushing holders in their places and
mark and drill the 3 holes for the bolts to retain them, and the bigger hole
for the bar to go through (you'll want front wheels off for this).  Looks
like the "front bar improved adapter" would make an even better template
for this purpose.  I believe that if you can get someone with a very thin
arm to help you, or exercise great ingenuity, you will be able to get the
backing plate positioned on the inside of the sheet metal and can screw
the bolts through the bushing holder on the outside into the nuts on the
backing plate and you have mostly got that problem licked.  Otherwise,
remove the fuel tank so you have room to work, which is what I had to
do, lacking the nice improved backing plate.  If ever I have to get inside
there again on my '77 I'd tack weld these plates (I fabricated something
much like what they now sell to do this) in place (because I now have a
welder), but tain't necessary.  That takes care of mounting the bar.

You also need to cut off the A arm bar attachments and replace them
with what Weltmeister now calls its U-tab kit, which bolts into the place
the attachments used to be.  Lucky you  that you are comfortable taking
the A arms off and to a buddy with machine tools.  It can be done on the
car with nothing more than a hacksaw, file, and drill.  When I got a
welder I welded mine as well, just for good measure, but that isn't
necessary.  Now your car will be set up much like its earlier cousins
were, swaybar wise.

Didn't this stuff come with some instructions on all this? 

Alles klar?
