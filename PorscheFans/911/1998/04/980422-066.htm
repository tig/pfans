The short answer is yes, these things work.  Get a good one that
auto-senses full battery charge and shuts off. It seems to me that your
situation is basically the same as that posed by storage for the
winter.  A good discussion of this is provided on the NorthEast Region
PCA web site under Russell's Tech Tips
(http://www.porschenet.com/techtips.html).  Look for the Winter Storage
procedure (Dec 5, 1997; http://www.porschenet.com/winter.html).

While this could be a job for Charlie's new and improved search engine
(getting better and better, CK!), I'm of the Ross Parker school of
thought:  I'd rather see you ask the question and get an answer than
damage the car!

Hope this helps.  If you have any trouble getting to the site, I can
send you the info directly.
