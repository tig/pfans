<<Trying to remove side rubber strip under door on rocker panel - it has

slightly away along the top center portion of the strip and I'm trying to
check if it can be tightened. I see the three bolts underneath (although I
seem to be missing one) as well as missing the rear plastic return cover that
is held at each end by two screws. It appears to be a screw about midway under
the strip that needs to tightened. Another  simple trick I'm sure - but I'll
still take any solutions.>>

RWW696:
Before removing, it helps to place corresponding reference marks on the body
and rubber so the reinstalled rubber is the same length as the rocker strip
(rubber stretches).... so add a few marks with a white grease pencil. To
remove the rubber, remove the end caps, then just start on one end of the
rocker strip and pull it off. If the strip is just loose and one screw needs
tightening, remove the rubber just past the loose screw. The metal rocker
strip has two flat areas along its length that fit into corresponding slots in
the rubber trim. The strip itself is held on by 5-6 (?) sheet metal screws and
some support braces on the lower part of the strip. 

Install the rubber as follows: If completely removed, start at one end and
wrestle the rubber trim onto the rocker strip, then bend the rubber trim back
about 65-75 deg. and push the rubber into place. Continue doing this until the
entire rubber trim is in place. Bending the rubber backwards spreads the slots
apart which eases installation onto the metal. You can spray some silicone,
rubber lube (or equiv.) onto the rubber to help the process.  This procedure
is illustrated in the factory service manual. If you need a copy of the
page(s), contact me via private email and I'll forward a copy to you. I
wondered about this process too until I stumbled across it in the manual.
