Ok, this one may come across as a dumb question.

I've got H4s on my car ('90 C2)... and I want to aim them properly.

I'm not worried about the mechanicals - I know where the adjustment screws
are and what they do, etc, but what I'm wondering is what the appropriate
aiming points should be?

I've always aimed headlights so that the center of the high-beam pattern
is at the same height as the center of the headlight, and the beams go
straight horizontally.

The H4 high beams seem to give off a beam pattern that's not clearly
defined, so it's tough to find the center to aim the lights. The low
beams, on the other hand, are VERY sharply defined.

Should these lights be aimed using the low beams, and if so, what are the
parameters I should use? The low-beam pattern is something like this
(crude drawing!!!):


                /|           /|
               / |          / |
     ---------/  |---------/  |------------


Any assistance will be, as usual, greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Ross
