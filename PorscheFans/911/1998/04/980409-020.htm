Hi again,

First, thanks to everyone who sent in fender lip measurements! Sounds
like my car is a bit lower than most, going by the fender lips.

Anyway, also wanted to mention that I re-measured my car again last night.
To my surprise, this time the biggest side-to-side difference was 1/4",
and when I measured from the suspension pivots (A-arm pivot and trailing
arm pivot), left and right measurements are IDENTICAL.

I'm a happy camper! ;^)

A couple of people asked where I bought the springs - I just noticed
them advertised again in PFans this morning...

I bought them from Al Solarali (sp?) - you can contact him at
'driver@fastauto.com'. The springs were CHEAP, came within the time
they were supposed to, and Al is quite cheerful to deal with.

The only problem I had were some (minor) chips in the epoxy coating on the
springs, a little colour-coordinated Tremclad and I'm not worried about it...

FYI, there are two different lowering kits for the 964 - mine is the
stiffer (Turbo/RSA) kit... cost was $170US ($215CDN) for 4 springs
plus shipping.

Cheers!

Ross
