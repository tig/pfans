How odd, all of the 911s I have seen from the early eighties on have rear
seat belts. Or are you asking about shoulder belts? At any rate, the chassis
should have the mounting points in place (welded in nuts) for seat belts.
Lucas Valdes at PE Products supplies seatbelt kits for Porsches and is quite
knowledgeable about their application. He is located in Los Osos,
California. His Panorama ad lists two numbers: 1-800-593-8787 (not sure if
this will work from the UK), and for FAX 805-528-7887. I have no connection
with his business, just a satisfied customer.

Subject: Rear Seat Belts


I think this is a thread explored before, so forgive the repetition, I
am looking at purchasing an '84 3.2 911 and notice it doesn't have rear
seat belts. This is a must have for any purchase to pass the
"practicality" test of my wife! Could anyone advise if there are likely
to be mounting points in this RHD car? If so how expensive/difficult is
it to install the belts. Whilst I'm at it I may as well ask the question
about booster/child seats that will fit the rear of this era of 911?

Hope you can assist.

Phil.
