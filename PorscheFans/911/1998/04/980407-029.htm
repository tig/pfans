I have a 1980 911 SC engine with stock CIS injection. I got this from a damaged car, which unfortunately broke a hose on the system. This tube/hose is composed of a metal "Y" section and some rubber parts. It primarily goes behind the main unit (pump) and curves down on the right side. If I remember right, it is about 3/4" in diameter.


Obviously, I am not expert on CIS. I am trying to remember details, but it has been about three weeks since I have seen it and even then only looked at it for a few minutes. 


Anyhow, the part is broken and I need a source to get a used one. I had originally planned to swap over to Webers, but it seems as though this will not be an easy task. I will swap the engine in with CIS for now and change to Webers in the future. So, if anybody is willing to sell parts of a CIS system, please let me know.


Thanks
