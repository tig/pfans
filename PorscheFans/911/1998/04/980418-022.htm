Philip,

I just installed one rear seat belt in my 1984 Cabriolet. I only put in
one because I don't think there is enough room for anyone behind me. 

I bought generic a rear seat belt kit which contained all of the
mounting hardware, instruction, etc. for $14.95 a the local Auto Parts
store. There are mount points visable when you raise the rear seat.
There should be two bolts for each seat. Remove the bolts and follow the
instructions for assembly of the mount and bolt it into place.

If you don't see the mounts/bolts feel around for a hole. Unless they
didn't put them in RHD cars.

Don't know about the booster seats, it's pretty tight back there. My
nine year son fits, but not much else.
