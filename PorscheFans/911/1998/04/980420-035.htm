Hi, all!

I did my 2nd autocross with my 911 this weekend - the first with my
new tires, wheels and suspension.

The local Corvette club held an auto-x which drew about 20 Corvettes,
perhaps 15 Porsches, and a few other assorted cars.

The course was REALLY tight - I was in 1st gear for most of it, was only
able to catch 2nd gear on a single straight. The first gear stuff was
right at the top of the rev range.

I guess I did pretty well. The really fast cars were around 100 or 101 seconds,
my best run was 108, kind of in the "medium fast" group. I'm quite happy
with that running standard street rubber. Makes me really wonder what
the car would be like with R1's!

I didn't molest any cones. Wonder if that means I wasn't trying hard
enough? ;^) I *did* DNF in my first run, screwed up one very tight turn
and got a little flustered from that and missed a gate. Next two runs
were clean and a lot faster.

The whole package of springs, wheel, tires and lowering the car seems
to work really well. Still some understeer in really slow corners, but
that's to be expected. Lots of grip, though, and the car worked especially
well in the slalom and lane-change sections, with great turn-in and very
slight (easy to catch) oversteer.

Wes Shew (a PFans 944 member) was I believe the fastest Porsche in the
event, with his 944S2, despite munching the odd cone here and there!

Much fun was had by all, except two Corvette drivers, one who launched
his car over a curb and half-way down a VERY steep grass bank, and the
other who grenaded his engine, dumping oil and anti-freeze ALL OVER the
course and necessitating changing the course for subsequent runs (I'd
put my 3 runs in already, thankfully!)

Cheers!

Ross
