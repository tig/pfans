Hi all.  I had posted that I was going to give the Yoko A032R's a try. 
Many people were interested in these tires and I promised a "review".  Here
it is.

I took my SC to Lime Rock Park last weekend for a DE event.  My first event
with the A032's.  I previously used BFG R1's.

I was VERY happy with them.  They are NOT as "fast" a tire as the R1's. 
But this was good for me.  I'm not a great driver, so I was never able to
drive the R1's to the point that I could experience them at the limit.  So,
I was very apprehensive to drive faster to get them to slide a bit.  No
matter how bad I screwed up, I could always just turn the wheel to correct.

The A032's slide very nicely, and at a lower speed.  I was running 28psi
front and 30psi rear.  I noticed some wear at the top of the sidewalls. 
Also, they were squealing quite a bit, even at lower speeds.  So I upped
the pressure to 30psi front and 34psi rear.  (BTW, it was a very cold day. 
I would guess low 40's).  What a difference!  No more squealing and better
traction, especially in the rear.

I started the day running 1min 11.5 sec.  By the end of the day I was
running 1min 7.5 sec.  And, I was able to begin learning how to handle my
911 as it is starting to slide.  These tires really made me feel
comfortable while slowly increasing my speed.  They were very predictable.

These tires are supposed to be very good in the rain.  The tread pattern is
impressive looking (check out www.tirerack.com to see them).  They are
directional tires, but Abe Anderson (I met him at the track) informed me
that Yokohama told him that it is entirely safe to run them "backwards" on
dry pavement, but absolutely NOT IN THE RAIN.  So, they can be rotated for
longer life.  I have not tried this yet, but will next time (May).

I am very happy with these tires and would recommend them.  Especially to
more novice drivers.  BTW, I had no problem keeping up to other people in
my run group (same experience level) with R1's.  I would guess the R1's are
above their level as well.  I also think these tires allowed me to improve
my driving quite a bit.

Hope this helps some people make a more informed tire decision.  Let me
know if there are other questions regarding these tires.  I will try to
answer them.
