I'm having a hell of a time losing tranny fluid at rear main seal. I have an
early 915 (73T) box attached to a 78 3.0SC motor. Heres what is hapening......
Bolt tranny to motor, install and let idle for extended period of time. Go out
for ride - come back everything is ok. Go out again for a brisk (!) ride -
return and leaking tranny fluid like a sieve from bellhousing area.

I have relaced this seal twice - checked vent - no luck. Here are my latest
thoughts - tell me if I'm on to something or give me your thoughts on what I
should persue!

Guide tube is press fit in - oil seal rides in guide tube.... interference fit
is not all that tight.... As tranny heats up - remember brisk drive - alum.
case expands at quicker rate than steel guide tube resulting in less
interference with guide tube. As guide tube is in contact with clutch throwout
bearing when declutching guide tube is pulled out of tranny and oil seal is no
longer.

If this theory has merit, then what are my options????

a) Buy a new guide tube and check interference fit?

b) Buy guide tube and then install with Loctite bearing race slick stuff
(don't recall name) to really secure guide tube in tranny?

c) I have an inherent mis-match of tranny - clutch pressure/plate (doubtful
from what I have read)

Anyone else have any similar experieces????????
The ONLY bright spot to this whole story is..... I have become so adapt at
removing and installing 911 motors that if all hell breaks loose at my real
job I'm sure I could reside at Daytona and Sebring and make a living swapping
motors!!!!!! HA HA
