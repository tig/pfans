Pfans,,

     Saw a post from a guy named Holgor yesterday concerning MFI backfires.
Thought I might throw my experience into the hash and solicit helpful
comments:

     Had the same problem with my 1973 T MFI last Fall just before I put it
away for the Ohio winter.

     Happens when I lift off of the gas pedal, like on a long down hill or
in anticipation of an Interstate (autobahn) interchange.  One time a guy in
an Audi A-6 pulled up behind me to get a closer look at a 25 year old 911.
When the boom when off, followed by the black smoke, his face in my rear
view mirror had the look of a man who had just seen a air to air missile
touched off in  his general direction.

     Anyway, I think it is because the  MFI system is running a little
rich.  Over the winter I replaced the air hoses from the top of the left
heat exchanger to the MFI pump.  When the El Nino induced rains stop here
next Monday, I plan to get the car out of storage and sort things out.
Would appreciate any info you have.
