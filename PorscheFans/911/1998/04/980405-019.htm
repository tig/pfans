 Just takes some practice learning to push the accelerator after the tail
 comes out.  Actually the car was very forgiving (in my opinion).  I feel
 much better in a tail out attitude than with the front end pushing in most
 other cars.   >>

I agree. very controllable unless you really overcook a corner.
 
<< I'll buy another older 911 once the "yuppie" investors :-) decide they want
 to jack up the prices of some other cars.  I can't see spending more for a
 car now, than it originally cost then. >>

Don't bet on it, I see the older 911s going nowhere but up.
They are only about 1/6th the price of a new one.
 
>> I know a guy who purchased a Ferrari TR in the late 80's for about 300K. 
 Three years later the car was worth 150K (probably less now). <<

Way less! I've seen used TRs for about $50K.

>> I know
 plenty of people who paid 100+K for Ferrari 328s in the late 80's; now you
 can get the same cars for 20 to 40K.
 
 Time changes everything.  I'll run my RX-7 for now and wait for the 911
 prices to come down. <<
 
IMHO A rust free early 911 will never be cheaper. It just costs too much
to restore and/or rebuild the engine. There was about $40,000 in parts
and actual labor (much labor by the original owner/builder) put into
my "RS" copy and none of the $$ was extravagence.

You should be able to find a decent older E or S for about $15,000 now.
They were closer to $20,000 in the boom years and are creeping
back up again. Don't wait or you'll regret it!
