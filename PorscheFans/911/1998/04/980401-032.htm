Boy, what a response I've gotten regarding losses on a rear wheel dyno.  FYI
the opinions I've rec'd so far are anywhere from 8-15% loss.  There was also
a thread saying that a 271hp car came in at 266rwhp and a 247hp car came in
at 240rwhp.  It should be noted that the person who supplied me with these
figures qualified the statement by saying that in his opion, Porsche HP
figures are  conservative. Unfortunatly, the mods I made to my
car(Weltmeister chip, K&N air filter, and a cat. by-pass tube) were made
over a period of time and I didn't take before and after readings.
It should be noted that the operator of the Dyno-Jet told us that the losses
were about 20% which seems high.  I don't think that it would take 40+hp to
drive a trans and diff. Anyone else with an opion?
