Doug:

The Weber carbs are a "pain in the buttocks" (as Forest Gump would say) to
set-up.   The correct fuel pressure is ~ 2.0 - 2.5 psi, or a pinch higher for
racing applications.   When using a fuel pressure regulator, be sure to get a
good quality unit, and install a gauge.  I recently had a customer with a 74
911S, 2.7, with a "clamp the hose" style fuel pressure regulator that came in
an aftermarket Weber carb kit.  It worked great....if    you like to watch
fuel run out of the exhaust.   His pressure was extremely high, 15psi+,  and
it would pulsate up and down with the cycling of the fuel pump.   

I have not personally used the Holley fuel pumps, but let's face it, Holley is
the King of the carbs.   So, if you would use their products, It is relatively
certain that they should perform well.   I have had good luck with Carter
pumps, and (believe it or not) AC-Delco.   However, if the fuel pump that you
buy is "factory pre-regulated", regulate it anyway.  The factory regulated
pumps are (in my experience) very inconsistent.  

I think that one of the best things to do once you have your carbs set-up, is
to install a "killer, fire breathing, mean as hell" ignition system, and
install hotter plugs.  My experience with Webers is that the OEM ignition
system is a bit weak.  I used the Crane HI-6000 with a PS-91 coil as it is a
good, reliable, and relatively inexpensive unit. As a matter of fact, when I
installed mine (73 911S), I was a little freaked out about installing the
hotter plugs.  I had been told that the hotter plugs would, "Surely burn a
hole in the piston". However, after much trial & error, and a few bucks later,
I went from the stock heat range in a linear fashion of 3 (WR3DPO...very
expensive!) to the effective and fully functional heat range of 7
(WR7DP...inexpensive).  I settled at this heat range, because it was the
lowest heat range plug that the plugs would not foul out with carbon/fuel.   I
drove the hell out of that car (literally), and the pistons held up just fine.
By the way, if you do decide to upgrade your ignition, stay away from the
photo-optical triggerd units.  Trust me on this one, they will give you
nothing but trouble.  Also, there is a company called PMO, which is
considered by many to be the Porsche application Weber experts, perhaps they
may have the specifics for your area/elevation (i.e. jetting)   If I can be of
any further help or you have any other questions you think I can help you
with, please feel free to e-mail me!!   I would be glad to help.
