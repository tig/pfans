<< Hello All,
     I have a question for the group. I recently went trough the effort
 to replace all the buschings, and ball joints and tie rod ends, etc.
 Basically rebuilt the front end.
     I have a '72E, which originally had foam washers behind the end caps
 on the rear of the arm. I have talked to a couple of vendors, and to a
 couple of Porsche dealers here, with no luck finding them.
     I believe they are intended to keep grit and dust out of the A-arm
 shaft. A mechanic a Zim's said he would not bother with them, but that
 just does not seem right.
     Anyone out there have any ideas? Do you think these should be
 replaced?
 
 Regards,

Eric,
When I rebuilt the front end of my 911, I cut new washers from some foam I had
in the shop and placed them in front of the torsion caps.  No problems so far.
