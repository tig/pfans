I've had similar problems with my '85 Targa. If your situation is that the
clips initially grab but "pop" off the bar when you hit bumps, breath or cause
other disturbances, try one of those cheap expandable curtain rods. You know
them, they are rod shaped and have a rubber tip on each end, and compress
under pressure when pushed from both ends under tension-they have a spring
inside. I found one laying around the house that is about an inch
(uncompressed) longer than the distance from the front targa bar leather to
the rear bar. I spray painted mine flat black, found a piece of plastic about
an inch square-covered it with black electrical tape-and used it to shield the
leather from the curtain rod. Next, just put the rod in and I found that the
added stability of the rod was enough to keep the clips from "poping" out of
the front targa bar. And, believe it or not, you hardly notice the black
curtain rod above your head in the interior. This is not an original idea, got
it from somebody on the list and it works! Kudos to Porschefans. Total cost of
this project is about $2.50.
