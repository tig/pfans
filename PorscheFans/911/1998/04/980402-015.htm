     Subj:  Re2: What is a power tube???
     
     I would be interested to know what a power tube is. Is this one of the 
     muffler bypass pipes you see advertised in various publications. If it 
     is, is it the pipe that replaces the primary or secondary muffler and 
     what about these bypass pipes you can buy to replace the cat. I would 
     really like to hear from experienced owners about power gains, noise 
     gains and the quality of the bypass pipes on the market. Thanks again 
     for all of the valuable information.
     
     Thank You

     Subject: Re: power tube
     
     My power tube was on the car when I bought it. I like the sound, which
     is a little louder that the Lexus levels of the stock system, but way
     below my 914 with a stock exhaust. In other words, the neighborhood
     association won't be putting your house up for bids. 
     Inside the car, I don't notice much, no resonance or such, and I don't
     really hear the exhaust unless the windows are open.
     
     As for power, who knows? Is the weight difference really 60 lbs or 
     were
     you exaggerating? More like 10 or 20 would be my guess. Please tell me
     if I'm wrong.
