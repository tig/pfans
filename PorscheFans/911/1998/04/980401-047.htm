Ned,
  I agree with Eric Brown. 1st and 2nd take most of
the wear. Even when in good shape, downshifting into
my 1st is pretty difficult even though I match revs.
 I was looking at the dog teeth on my gearbox last
week and after only two summers 1st gear dog teeth 
are pretty "aerodynamic" (teeth are rounded instead 
of sharp) and 2nd is getting there.
   On a positive note, Gary Fairbanks sells parts for
your transmission at a big discount. If you could
limit yourself to just fixing 1st and 2nd by replacing
the dog teeth (~$100ea) and synchros ($20ea) and 
slider ($95) plus a gasket set you're looking at around
$250 in parts. I'm replacing both sliders, 4 dog teeth,
and all the synchros for $650 not counting trans fluid.
If you have to pay someone to R&R the engine you
may be ahead to do a lot more "while you're in there".

Hey P-Fans!

I have problem shifting into 1st and 2nd gears on my '79 911 SC.
Sometimes it grinds...I reclutch and it goes in fine.  Other times it
just does not go in gear all the way.    What steps should I take to
resolve this problem?

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
