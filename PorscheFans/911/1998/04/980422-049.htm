Hey folks,
 what a great opportunity to seek some experienced advice! I'm wondering
what any of you out there are getting for gas mileage? I find that I'm
getting a best of only about 15 with my '80 SC, and if I do much around
town driving, it can fall below this to the 13-14 region. With a 20
gallon tank, I'm lucky to get much over 300 mi. out of it. I don't
really horse the car that much, so I'm pretty convinced I've got some
sort of problem, and possibly one of you wiseacres out there can buy me
a clue. For a few more details; the car's got about 140K on the clock. I
just did a top end job about 3500 ago. The pistons were reringed, and
the heads done by a reputable local shop using all new valves. The
compressions are 175-190 all around. I've done the usual tuneup stuff of
course; replaced the plug wires (ouch), plugs, adjusted the valves, and
replaced the oxy sensor and fuel filters as well. I've checked the
auxiliary air regulator and the cold start valve for leaks, as well as
checked the cold and warm control pressures and fuel pressures, which
were in spec. I also replaced the injector seals, intake gaskets, and
rubber boots between the air box and intake runners, and while I was at
it, brought the injectors to a local shop to have the spray pattern
checked out. All were OK except one, which I replaced. The shop where I
did the work has an exhaust gas analyzer, so after I reassembled the
engine, I set the mixture about mid-range. I believe the allowable %CO
is .2-.8, and I set it at about .6. If I lean it out much more, the car
will stumble and hesitate upon tipin when cold and just not run well.
The car runs clean however, and has no trouble passing the CA smog check
with crying flullers. In desperation, I've also tried fuel injection
cleaners, again to no avail. I know this sounds like a lot of stuff, but
I've been getting the same crappy mileage since buying the thing, and
have tried alot to alleviate the condition. When I had it apart,
naturally I replaced whatever looked the least bit questionable (much to
my wallet's chagrin), but despite my high expectations, fuel economy
remained dismal after reassembly. I know Porsches aren't about gas
mileage, but it kind of chaps me that Corvette owners with small block
chevies should be getting better mileage than me, especially the way I
drive it. About the only theories I have left are that my cat is
partially plugged and causing a restriction, or could my electronic
ignition be making a weak spark from a coil/control unit problem? You'd
think that would show up in dirty emissions though... I've also heard it
mentioned that after a certain age, the mixture control units just don't
work well anymore due to wear in the piston. Anyway, if anyone has any
feedback or words of wisdom, it'd be muchos appreciados. Sorry about the
book, and thanks gents...
