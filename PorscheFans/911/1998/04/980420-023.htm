Does everything else in the car work properly, i.e. headlights, guages
etc... I had a problem in my SC which I isolated to the ignition switch.
It developed the ability to be turned a fraction too far clockwise. This
disabled everything that goes off when your car is in the start mode. Once
I learned of the source I learned to back the kay off in a counter
clockwise direction once the car started. 

Hope this helps,

Chris
