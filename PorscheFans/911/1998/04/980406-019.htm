Hi Pfans,

Cristopher Paul Jares  wrote about his woes with the brakes..


Basically Chris I have been there and done exactly that. Except I had 
the original (1988) locking wheel nuts which use a normal wheel 
brace after removing the shroud with the little key. The P/O or 
wrench had overtightened the things and they snapped off on 
both rears leaving a small non-hex part on the stud. I had to drill 
and cut them out of the wheel, it took forever!.

You should be ok but I would not recommend trying to remove them 
unless you have the correct key. If the small stub gets mangled 
(almost certain without using the key) then there is no way a new key 
will fit and you will have to do what I did. They must be very tight 
if the old key broke. Your best bet is to get another key and hope it 
doesnt break.

When I replaced my W/locks with the newer Porsche ones like yours, 
they came with a sticker with the key No. to affix to the service 
book if a replacement is req'd, Did you keep yours safe?

I doubt that you have a M/C problem. After I finally removed my 
wheels and changed the Pads I too had a soft brake pedal. I looked at 
the old pads and by putting a straight edge across them I could see 
that they had not worn flat. I can't remember if they were concave or 
convex but they had worn to fit the rotors which have approx 40,000 
Miles on them. It took a good 200-300 Miles before the new pads 
bedded, then the brakes worked as well as before and the pedal firmed 
up. I have been told that this is the normal wear pattern for rotors. 
I did not have a micrometer handy or I would have measured them but 
they don't look that worn to the eye.


BTW the normal symptoms of a defective M/C is that the brake pedal 
will slowly travel toward the floor when the brakes are applied for a 
minuite or so (with the car stationary of course). In your case you 
may need to pump them once to get a firm pedal but if you then hold 
it there the pedal should not get any softer. This is apart from the 
obvious of any leaks, but then these are often hard too see.


Good luck anyway,
