MILLERESS <MILLERESS@aol.com> asked :

>> I wonder if anyone could help me with a problem I'm having.  I have a 1973
911-T with CIS.  As the engine reaches full operating temp. (180 degrees +/-)
the oil pressure drops approx. 20 psi.  I am currently using Castrol GTX
10-30.  Could the oil be to light weight?  Could the by-pass valve be
sticking?  Oil pump going bad? <<

This is normal to an extent. Some older 911 engines will show
very little pressure at idle on a warm engine. 
When it is warm you should have roughly 10 PSI per 1,000 RPMS
(i.e. 40 PSI at 4000). A bit lower if you have many miles
is nothing to worry about.

That said, I do not recommend the brand or grade of oil that you
are using for warm weather. I liked 15/40 in my S but it is hard to find 
in a good brand (no longer made by Valvoline). I use 20/50 in 
my "RS". Kendall or Valvoline are good, or stick to a good
oil made from Pennsylvania crude and don't believe all the TV ads.
IMHO of course :
many people are happy with Castrol but they would probably 
be happy with anything if they change their oil properly :-).
