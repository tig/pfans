You're absolutley correct Paul!  It's good to hear of quality experiences 
out in Porsche and Performance car Vendor Land.  I recently went to 
GingerMan Raceway for an open event and truly enjoyed myself.  In 
preperation for the event I contacted John Ruther at Northstar Motorsports 
in Barrington IL to find out whether or not he carried a better than stock 
brake pad, which he did.  I asked him his recommendations for replacement 
and he suggested a set of Performance Friction Z rated Metallics, minimum 
squeal (my experience is zero squeal) and good heat resistance.  Couldn't 
have been happier with the service I received there...John was willing to 
answer all of my questions and he even took a moment to chat with me 
regarding his experiences at GingerMan and help allieviate some trepidation 
I had.

Eric

As a side note the staff at GingerMan were outstanding.

With the negative experiences with certain parts suppliers
happening lately, I just wanted to relate my good experience.
I ordered rotors, pads, oil return tubes and a turbo tie-rod
kit for my 911 from PAR (no affiliation). When I received the
parts, I noticed the spacers for the tie-rods and one of the
oil return tubes was missing. I called them up, they
apologized for the mix-up, and sent the missing parts that day.
Good service and good prices. PAR advertises in Pano and Excellence.
