Volney-
With the 3.2 in your car I am not sure, But on my 72S, that light is not
an oil pressure light. As far as I can tell, there is no oil pressure
light switch on the engine.  This might explain the overfill story.
When I first got the car, I kept wondering why the oil pressure light was
on when the gauge said that the pressure was fine. Which instrument so you
believe?  It finally dawned on me that the "oil pressure" light was on
only when the car was parked, doh!

The dual circuit brake system warning light is reset with a small
button between the wires on the switch on the side of the brake master
cylinder. It is not very easy to access.  I don't know why the light came
on when you locked up your brakes, but it would be good to find out, since
there must have been pressures unequal enough to disturb the warning
system.
