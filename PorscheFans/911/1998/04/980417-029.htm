Jeff and Peter,

Greetings from a 911 owner in NorthEast Baltimore County.  I have also
considered having my wheels refinished, but have not yet decided on
whether or not to replace the current 16" Fuchs with 17" 3-piece wheels.

Regarding refinishing, I do not have experience with the shop you
mention.  However, I have looked at Wheel Collision in Bath, PA
(800.292.RIMS, www.wheelcollision.com), Rennsport in Georgia
(770.992.9442, www.rennsport.com), and Wheel Enhancement in California
(310.836.8908, www.wheelenhancement.com).

Regarding the first two, both do straightening and refinishing, but I
have been concerned that they may not be able to match the original
anodized finish on the Fuchs wheels.  I suspect the same may be true of
the shop in Maryland.  IMHO, if you are looking for a refinishing that
meets original appearance and caliber, Wheel Enhancement is the place to
go.  They are clearly knowledgeable about Porsche wheels and are not
significantly more expensive than Rennsport or Wheel Enhancement; I was
quoted $580 to strip, polish, and reanodize a set of 4 Fuchs wheels in
the original black finish.

On the other hand, if you want a different finish, I have heard good
things about both Rennsport and Wheel Collision with respect to quality
of workmanship.  My suggestion would be to check out all of these
websites and e-mail them with your specific needs.

Hope this helps, and good luck.
