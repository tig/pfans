Hello Peter,

I have an 88 Carerra which has D40-M2's on the front. I have had them 
balanced twice now but I get a vibration which starts at 65 and goes 
through to about 80. I don't see how it can be the tires if they 
balance up ok on the machine like mine did, but then what do I know 
about tires. I was planning on replacing the shocks this summer and 
whilst about it checking the ball joints. I have already checked and 
repacked the w/bearings but to no effect. I will report on what 
happens after I have completed the work.

In the mean time if anybody else has a similar problem using D40 M2's 
please let us know.
