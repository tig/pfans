Tim,
    Talk to Ross (white Carrera #34) at one of the events if you haven't
already. He used to run a 3.0 liter. For the 3.2 I think he likes the B & B
because of the 1 1/2 inch primary tubes running into the 1 5/8 inch after the
collector. This keeps the exhaust gases moving faster or something for less
backpressure/better scavenging (I think). This may work for you on the 3.0
liter as well. I've heard they(B & B) had some weld quality problems, but
maybe they're better now....?? 
    Saw the other post. Galen Bieker has a good reputation. Dwayne
Dement(Vision), Greg Brown(BRD), and Mark Hergeshiemer do as well. You're
lucky to have such a quantity of good Porsche Performance Technicians out
there and a veritable plethora of events.

Good Luck,
Rob
1979 911SC w/3.2 and 1 5/8 headers and Supertrapps cause it was cheaper and
sounded cool
