I am ready to tackle steering wheel vibration on my 911 (front steering wheel
vibration at some speeds).  I think one of the original Bilsteins is a little
weak.

Car:   '78 911 SC   98 K miles

I am about to do the following:

1. Replace front shocks
2. Inspect and replace wheel bearings if need be (machine shop to replace
bearing races)
3. Replace front ball joints
4. Rebuild Front Calipers
5. Undecided on A-arm bushings and roll bar bushings

I plan to remove the A-arm (wishbone in the Porsche manual) so that I (or a
friendly neighborhood Porsche mechanic) can apply the 180 ft lbs to the ball
joints.  I don't think I can do it lying on my back with the A-arms in the
car.

I noticed Chris Bennet (I appreciate your tips Chris) made it sound like it
was difficult to remove the wishbones from the car.  Is there something
exceptionally difficult in removing the wishbones (AKA A-arms)?  From the
Haynes Manual and the Prosche factory manuals it appears straightforward to
remove them (need to install rear bolt to keep cross member from falling).  Is
there some "monster" lurking under the A-arm bridge that appears when the A-
arms are removed?  If there is,  anyone out there have "monster repellant"?
Maybe the Ball joints are fine and the extra effort to remove the A-arms to
replace the ball joints (that I've already purchased) is not worth it?

Any comments on the A-arm "monster" would be appreciated.
