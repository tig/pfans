Scott,
  My experience with Speedware was very unsatisfactory.
It took me several _months_ to get my stuff last year and the 
original salesman could never talk to me whenever I called to see
about my order.  I did finally received a 6 pts harness - though
I ordered a 5 pt. I have no idea what I paid for (5 or 6) as they
never sent me an invoice. (They were very prompt about charging
my credit card when I placed the order though.)
  While I was waiting for Speedware, I ordered another harness 
from OG Racing and they were extremely helpful. 
I have a unused 6pt anti-sub strap for TRW/Sabelt you can
have 4 free.  A 6pt has certain (supposed) safety concerns that 
made prefer the 5pt. (Presses on the 2 important veins in
your crotch.) Ask the guy at OG Racing - even if they don't
have your belts in stock.
