Dear Listmembers,

When starting off for work this morning my alternator light stayed lit for
about one-quarter mile, then went out.  Upon arriving to work (about 40
miles) things seemed normal, except the alternator light didn't "blink"
like it usually does when turning off the ignition.  I also noticed the
driver's side headlamp bulb (that I replaced about 3 months ago) was not
operating.  Eight hours later the car started right up, although the
alternator light did not come on at all when turning the key to start the
car.  I quickly noticed that my turn indicators and upshift light on the
tachometer were much dimmer than usual.  Upon arriving home I tried to
restart the car, and the starter motor would barely turn.

I figured I'd try a new battery (the current one shows a discharge
condition in its window), and hope that's the extent of my problem.  My
question is, does the above sound like just an old, worn out battery or
possibly an alternator/regulator problem.  The car has about 100K, and as
far as I know still the original alternator.  Any help appreciated!

Ron Bolsky
