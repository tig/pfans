Can't help you too much on the seat cover and brake questions, although
I'm interested in the responses you receive regarding the brakes. 

On the issue of car covers, I suggest you take a look at the Automotion
catalog, contact them at 800-777-8881 or refer to www.automotion.com.
Automotion tends to be a bit high on some items, but they offer 6
different types of car cover materials. Their catalog does a good job
detailing the different materials available and will give you a good
overview of which material works best for specific uses. The cover
prices range from $126.98 - $349.98. A wide range, but a small price to
protect the car. Automotion may be a good starting place to get the
possibilities. You may want to buy from them or go elsewhere for a lower
price. Other than pricey for some items, I've always had good
experiences dealing with them. Good luck.

'95 993


Hello P Fans,

    I'm hoping someone can help with a few questions I have. Can anyone
recommend a source for good quality but not expensive seat covers for my
993? I have seen a number of adds in Excellence for sheepskin covers in
the $100-120 price range per seat. Does anyone have any experience with
different brake pads that don't produce as much dust as the factory
ones? If so, can you tell me how much and where to get these pads? I
have seen some posts on Metal Master pads before. I have a Porsche car
cover that isn't very good and beginning to wear through, can someone
recommend a good cover that isn't too bulky or costly that can handle
the mid-Florida east coast weather (Clearwater/Tampa)? Has anyone tried
to repair stone chips and what technique did you use? Larry Reynolds of
Care Care Specialties has a procedure that sounds reasonable, has anyone
tried Larry's approach?

Thanks for all the help, someday maybe I'll be able to return the favor.
