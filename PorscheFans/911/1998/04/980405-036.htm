Tory, if you look inside your wheel well, should see an extruded, roughly 
triangular area where the through-the-body sway bar goes.  Use your 
new bushings/mounts as a pattern and mark holes for the 3 bolt holes and 
the sway bar hole.  Drill them out on either side.

I mounted the reinforcements through the (more) open area between the gas 
tank and the passenger side wheel well.  As I remember, was able to place
the passenger side by hand; the driver's side was harder.  I tied a length
of cord to this mount, ran the sway bar through the body almost to the 
passenger side, mounted the driver's side reinforcement on the sway bar, then
pulled the plate along the bar to the driver's side well (had to do some
playing/
wiggling of the sway bar to get the plate past the tighter areas - DON'T pull 
the bar through the passenger well until you have the driver's side mount in
place).

I am really surprised you didn't get any kind of instructions with this beast
- 
or are you just trying to get added help?  Admittedly the above wasn't in 
the instructions - I improvised them.

 Thanks Ray,
 
 I got most of it done, going to buy a press tomorrow as this is the second
time I've needed one.
 
 I got the U-tabs mounted. I also have the backing plate,. reinforcement that
you mentioned but I have no idea exactly where it mounts as I don't see much
room for the plate and stuff to go..
 
 If you have any suggestions on exactly where to place it so I don't go
drilling 5 million holes I would trully appreciate it.. I keep seeing people
mention body, I figure they mean inner fender well, like the wall to the
trunk. But there is not much room..
 
 Thanks again,

 Tory, I don't know where you bought the sway bar and U-tab kit, but
 as i remember when I did this change on first my '76 then my '84, I welded
 the U-tabs to the A-arms so that they were directly under the new sway
 bar ends.
 
 One warning - how are you mounting the sway bar to the body?  Just
 bolting it to the sheet metal is a no-no; you'll tear up the body in no
 time.  You need a reinforcing piece on the inside of the body.  I made
 up a 3/16" steel plate the same outside dimension as the triangular
 sway bar mount/bushing with a hole in the center for the bar to pass 
 through.  I then drilled 3 holes at the corners and welded 3 bolts to the 
 plate so they stick through the plate and through the 3 mounting holes
 on the bushing mounting.  I placed this on the inside of the body and
 bolted the new sway bar bushing/mount to the outside of this.  
 
 I wrote up the procedure forthe Porsche Club of America magazine, and
 they published it in Volume IX of their "Up-Fixin' der Porsche" technical
 summary.
 
 Good luck!

 Okay sorry for the second posting. I had forgotten that a
 co-worker has a 84 carerra. I went and looked at his suspension
 and it's exactly the same as mine. So my thoughts are how is the
 Welt meister bar suppose to be installed. Even the Automotion
 catalog has this same bar (That I have) listed for like 74-89...
 So I must be totally missing something..

 Obviously still learning and will do more research before I hit
 my Email mailer!
