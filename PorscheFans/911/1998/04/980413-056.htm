Hi Samer,

I see you got the '72; congratulations!  Regarding your questions, here
are some suggestions:

>I want to purchase some service manuals for a Euro 72 911S Targa.
Other
>than the factory manuals, I have seen listings for the Haynes manual
and
>nothing else.  Is this the best one available ? Is this the only one
>available ?
The Haynes manual is not always very useful, but worth having.  Another
Haynes manual I have found more helpful is Porter and Morgan's 'Porsche
911 Purchase and Restoration Guide' (available from Automotion,
800.777.8881).

>Not too long ago, I saw a recommendation on the digest for a Bosch MFI
>manual. Would someone list the exact title of that book along with the
Bosch
>part number ?
Didn't see a Bosch book for your year, but there are several general
Bosch FI books listed by Automotion and Performance Products
(800.423.3173).  Maybe someone can give you a more specific name and
number, or call these vendors to see if they can get what you need.

>And finally, would someone know where and how I can purchase the
"Porsche
>Specifications Book" for this car ?
Stoddard's (800.342.1414) lists the Technical Specifications Manual for
your car as WKD.422.020 (911 '72-'73).  There is also a book entitled
'Porsche Parts and Technical Reference Catalog' which is worth having;
mine is for '74-89 (PNA.000.147), but there is probably a similar
catalog for '72.  You might want to try MY Porsche for this one
(800.655.3280).

Good luck, and enjoy your car!

Robert Herbert
