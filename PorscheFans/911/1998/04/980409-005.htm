Hi Chuck

I'm all for the used tank... However, one used tank of mine did have a good
size chunk of a piston in it.  Obviously, a magnet wouldn't find this, but
my solvent "shaken, not stirred" cocktail sure did.  Good as new!

>I recently purchased a rust-free 1978 911 Targa with 87K from the original
>owner.  It needs at little work, but I should be on the road shortly.

>I took the car to a local import mechanic to fix the "little stuff."  It
needs
>a voltage regulator for the alternator, a regulator for the passenger
window
>and an oil tank,  which it is leaking.
>
>The mechanic recommended a new tank to the tune of around $800.  I called
>around to several used parts places and have found used tanks for
>significantly less.  I mentioned this to the mechanic, he said that I
should
>still go with the new tank because there may be metal pieces or foreign
>objects in the used tank.  My question is whether or not it's worth extra
>$500-600 to buy a new tank.  Couldn't I run some parts cleaner through the
>used tank to get any crud out and buy one of the those magnetized oil
plugs?
>Also, it seems like a decent used Porsche parts dealer wouldn't be selling
>rusty tanks with exploded engine parts in them...
>
>Thanks.
