Hey all,

I was just curious after paying $17.95 for a bolt if the
Porschefans have set up any discounts at dealers, or maybe PCA
discounts etc?

I know in my other club (CLUB DSM) we basically went out and had
dealers give us 20% discounts and had other places give other
deals. Also we went in on group purchases a lot that saved us
hundreds of dollars on misc performance products.

I know this is the Porsche list and those that don't wrench and
those that have a TT don't really care about discounts (although
it's a wise financial move even if you are bill gates, okay so
maybe not him)..

If anyone has setup anything like this can you let me know. Or is
this something that people on the list really don't have any
interest in?  Meaning getting dealer discounts (I will be shocked
if I find that PCA hasn't setup discounts)..

Well enough from me..

Thanks

Actually the front is all together and I think that I adjusted the
front weltmeister bars correctly. Will see,  The rear of the car
is now in pieces..
