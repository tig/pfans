There really is not too much real world difference in the cars in my
opinion.  The C2 is lighter and has more traditional handling
characteristics.  The C4 has much better traction on slippery roads and
while cornering.  The C4 is more complicated, but the system seems to be
very reliable as long as the front differential is not leaking.

I personnally prefer the C4 as it is a much more stable car for everyday
driving and is quicker off the line because of the better initial traction,
despite being slower once moving because of the added weight.  It is also
kinda fun telling people I have a 4x4 Porsche.  When looking for mine, I
was leaning to the C4 but would have bought either if I found the "right" car.

I love my C4 although a few misc maintenance items can be surprisingly
expensive or complicated so be ready.  They are wonderful cars to drive.
