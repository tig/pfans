Peter,
It has been my experience and info from several Pmechanics that B&G 44K is
THE stuff for cleaning injectors.  And although I've heard positive things
about Chevron's Techron injector cleaner, I have used 44K once annually
($19) with a full tank of premium and found it works as advertised...  You
only need use it once and it removes ALL gummy fuel deposits and leaves
them NEW looking.  

B&G also markets several other fuel and oil additives.  I also use their
MOA (2cans) with each oil change (I forget the price...about $6-8/can).
I've found it reduces that nasty burnt oil residue often found in oil
cooled engines.  The usual disclaimers apply; merely a very satisfied
customer.
