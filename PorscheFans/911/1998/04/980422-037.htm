Sean,

I just replaced mine two weekends ago.  It is easy, but refilling the
transmission is a real pain.  The switch is located at the very front of
the trans.  It will be on the passenger side where the shift rod enters
the tranny.  It could be that the pins have just disconnected. There
should be two pins covered by a bell shaped rubber boot.  The pins do
not sit in any kind of plastic connector and just insert into the switch
directly.  They look kinda like.. um .. a certain male body part.

If you have to replace the switch:
0. jack entire car up so you can get underneath, keeping it level helps.
0.5 spray plugs and switch with penetrating oil.
1. open trans FILL plug.  If you cant open it at least you will be able
to drive to the mechanics.
2.  open trans drain plug and hold nose while stinky trans fluid drains
out.
3.  Find a nice open wrench to fit switch and remove.  Try not to remove
the plunger.  I didn't with mine.
4.  insert new switch with anti-seize and torque to spec book (its at
home or I would tell you)
5.  insert wired pins into switch and cover with rubber boot.
6.  clean drain plug and reinstall with anti-seize to spec torque.
7.  Figure out a way to fill trans with 3 liters of your favorite gear
oil (I use Swepco 201).  Removing the rear drivers wheel is a good
start.  But I still spilled.
8.  Replace wheel.
9.  clean and reinstall fill plug with anti-seize to torque spec

It helps to have a small torque wrench because it is a little tight in
there.  Also, if you are good with a solder iron you might want to
resolder the little pins to the harness while you are there.  Filling
was a two person job (THANKS Chris Bennet!).  I recommend a long piece
of hose attached to some kind of on/off valve you can buy at auto parts
stores.  My swepco came in a gallon bottle so we had to measure out the
3 liters which kinda made this job unpleasant.  Overall it was a
reasonably easy job.  I would rate it a 2-3 out of 10.  It is about the
same as changing your oil, except you have to raise the car.

About your spedo:  I have the same issue so if you fix yours let me know
how };)

Enjoy!

-Michael
