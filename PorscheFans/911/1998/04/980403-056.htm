Alex,

A few thoughts on finding rear seats for your '81 SC.  First, make sure
and specify whether your seats are for a coupe or a targa; your post
suggested a targa and the rear seats differ between the body styles.  I
concur with Dennie Bourbeau's endorsement of PartsHeaven (800.767.7250),
with a few caveats.  I got a pair of black leather 6-way power front
seats to update my '77 Coupe from them.  They were kind enough to send
photos in advance and the seats were in excellent condition.  The major
advantages of buying from an outfit like this are: 1) likely to have
what you need readily available, 2) allow the convenience of credit
purchase, 3) availability of miscellaneous screws, washers, and spacers
if needed, and 4) will accept returns, though with a restocking charge.
Major disadvantage is a substantial cost premium.

The same can be said for Einmalig (714.895.6567), where I got a pair of
black leather rear seats and pads.  An unexpected glitch occurred with
these seats: the spacing of the seams did not match on the seat backs (a
subtle difference), indicating they came from different cars.  Einmalig
is presently sending a matched replacement set.

If your need is immediate, both these vendors are good sources.  On the
other hand, if you are willing to shop around and be patient, you are
smart to post here, and to look in the classified ads in Panorama and
Excellence magazines.  It is common to see seats advertised by
individuals in these places, generally for much less money than a
commercial outfit.  I suggest getting detailed photographs in either
case.  Rear seats are a bit less common than fronts, as the latter seem
to be more often removed by persons converting to a race setup.
Commercial vendors will often have items from wrecked cars, or will have
seats recovered.

Also be aware that you may have a bit of trouble matching the carpeting
on the seat backs to your existing carpet.  If your old pieces are
reusable you are guaranteed a match, otherwise you may have to live with
color/style variations.

Hope this helps, and good luck finding what you need.
