This may not be the answer to your problem, but the bushings on the
a-arm are removable.  I was able to remove mine with a Rube-Goldberg
gear puller arrangement.  Pulled 'em right off.  Then I just sanded the
things smooth and installed poly bushings.  I do get some squeaking, but
it's so quiet that the only time you can actually here it is when going over
speed bumps, etc., (moving really slowly).

If you spend some time "fitting" the poly bushings to your car, I think you'll
find that they aren't too noisy or harsh for street use.  Huge improvement
over the rubber bushings on my car...
