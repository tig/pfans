First time user for a question.  I want to replace and upgrade the 
clutch on my 87 Carrera.  I have access to a roll around floor jack and 
have the Hayes manual on how to remove the engine/transmission.  I don't 
have a hoist, so the question is how do I jack the car up high enough to 
remove the engine/transmission?  Do you use ramps,jack stands, both, or 
some other way.  The manual said it, "easy" once you get the back end up 
high enough.  

The second part of the question is I am told that in order to upgrade 
the clutch, I need a special tool.  A Porsche mechanic told me this.  
Does anyone know what this tool is, and where can it be located.  The 
upgrade apparently does away with the rubber ring clutch and puts in a 
different fork and actuator.  This question may have been asked before, 
so if it has, please forgive my not looking thorough the archives.  Jon 
B from Nordstern, I decided to waste bandwidth.
