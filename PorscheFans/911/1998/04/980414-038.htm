Hi all,
A couple people on the list noticed when I mentioned I was getting
Koni Sports installed on my '88 Targa, and asked for feedback.  Well,
here it is:
The shocks replaced original Boges with 103K on them, so as you can
imagine the ride was quite a bit harsher.  I also had the car corner
balanced and alignment set to stock specs, as this is a fun street car
with occasional autocrosses.  The car is lowered a bit (by PO), and
the Konis on the back raised the height about an inch too high.  The
torsion bars had to be reclocked to get the rear back down.  On the
advice of the list, I kept my stock torsion bars.  I also have stock
16x6,7 205/225 wheels and tires.  After the work, I have a 1 degree
slope (from back to front of car).  Can't remember exactly how high
the fenders are, but I can look again if anyone wants to know.
The ride is harsher, but very acceptable for a sunny-day driver.  The
rear Konis are set to medium, and they have to come out of the car to
be reset.  I have been playing with the fronts, as they are adjustable
with a knob.  I was curious to see how much oversteer the stiff rear
shocks created, so I set the fronts to full soft.  The tail does start
sliding a little easier than before, but you have to lift in a turn to
make it happen.  It does not feel out of control at all.  I think for
high speed use (time trials) I would want a firmer setting up front
and softer in back, but that's not how I use the car. I will probably
start firming up the fronts to see what effect they have.

Nill asked about Targa flex, and I'm sure the Koni's would probably
work even better on a coupe.  The targa top does squeek and rattle a
lot more now, but I have no other indicator of how flexible the
chassis is.  I have noticed that the car feels much more stable on the
freeway, and lane changes and emergency maneuvers feel much more
controllable.  The slightly floaty feeling is gone.  Sorry I have no
auto-x information yet, but will soon :)
