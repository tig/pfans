Console does have to come off, or at least up high enough to get old
boot off and new one on (assuming knob is still off).  Your car is
significantly newer than mine, so I'm not sure that this applies, but:

On my '77, the console is attached to the tunnel with 3 phillips-head
screws.  The console is covered at the back with a plastic housing that
attaches with 4 similar screws; the upper two screws also hold the
plastic insert that houses the A/C control knobs.  Take off the 4 screws
on the housing and move it aside.  The housing hides two small metal
plates, one on each side, through which two screws  hold the console at
the rear; the other is at the front edge, just under the handbrake.
If you can lift the console up a bit to get the old boot off, you will
probably have enough clearance to get the new one on.  Then, as you
note, it just tucks in, and the console holds it down.

Some boots are designed to go on over the old boot, but mine wouldn't
fit this way.  To minimize wear, I glued some felt on the inside of the
new leather boot where it makes contact with the shift tower.  You may
also need to trim a little off the bottom of the new boot so it doesn't
protrude from the edges of the console.

Hope this helps, and glad to see you're enjoying your new Targa - ah, to
be topless in Florida in the spring...
