My 86' with recently turned 100K miles still bummed, :^( 
developed a slight smoking yup, the dreaded light blue.
As best i can tell it's about a quart ~700-800 miles depending on my mood. 
Went so far as to have a buddy follow me around just to see when it happens.
It seems to be when idling or going really slow or deaccellerating using the
engine which sounds like rings. It some times puffs a little at start up then
is gone, normal. It does NOT do any of this when cold, which leads me to
believe in 
the Physics Expansion stuff of aluminum, rings again. 
Big decision time, I'm an extreme perfectionist and will resolve this shortly.
Could someone with far more experience than i map out some options ? 
I.E. have compression test run, get results rebuild or replace entire engine
with
a low mileage wrecked car. 
Rebuild lower half, or possibly the valve stems could be the culprit ?
Thanks for all your help in advance.
Also this car will be For Sale soon and i want to fix it right, NOT just fix it
to fail later on someone else. 
Lookin for a 993c2S.....Blk/Blk
