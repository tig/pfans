     Todd,
     
     I just pulled my sunroof, cables and motor/gear drive unit to clean 
     and grease everything (PM work, as the car is not on the road yet).  I 
     don't know where your 1/8" went, but if you have to adjust the cable 
     it's pretty easy.  Unzip the zipper in the back of the headliner to 
     expose the motor/gear drive unit.  Remove only the two screws that 
     hold the gear drive in place.  It will slip off of the motor via a 
     rubber coupling.  At that point the cables are free.  Adjust the 
     sunroof the 1/8" you need and reinstall the gear drive.  Looking at my 
     cable, an 1/8" should not interfere with the gear position but you may 
     have to adjust either way for the gear to re-engage with the cable.  
     Worked well for me when correcting my cable travel.  
     Hope this helps

     I just removed my sunroof and replaced the seals. Now however it 
     doesn't close
     properly. The one side doesn't slide ahead far enough so the rear 
     can't come
     up. In other words as it travels forward the one side lags behind the 
     other by
     about 1/8". It worked great before so it must be something I did upon
     installation. Please, any help.
     
     Thanks
