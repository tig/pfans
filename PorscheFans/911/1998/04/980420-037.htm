Hi, William,

Well, I would, but I'm not sure if the '159' number is really right...

Someone else (Dave Darling from the 914 list) postulated that perhaps
the list software has been changed such that we are only getting notified
of the number of message-at-a-time mode subscribers. It *seems* as if
the list volume is right up there as usual, and all of the usual suspects
are still posting and responding to messages.

Responses to the last "spam attack" I sent out (last week) indicated that
most people were still on the list, only a few said they thought they'd
been bumped.

So, I think this was just a change the listmaster threw in and didn't
bother telling anyone. Yet another reason to look for a change...

Cheers,

Ross
