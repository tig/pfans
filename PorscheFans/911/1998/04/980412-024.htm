Hi All

I'm trying to diagnose my headlight washer system on an 84 Euro 911 turbo.
I think it's the relay, but I'm not sure.

I have noticed that I seem to have a defective switch, which I will replace.
It offers intermittent infinite resistance when closed...

Also, I notice that when I offer +12 to one of the gray sets on the relay,
it fires, and operates the pump.

Now, my questions:

1. Do the grays function as a trigger, firing the relay when closed?

2. Are one of the gray sets of wires feeding the relay supposed to be wired
to +12?  The diagram seems to illustrate this, although no voltage is
present at the grays (relay marked "S")  When I do offer +12 to either gray,
the pump operates.

This seems to suggest a stuck/bad portion of the relay.  It does seem odd
that when I feed +12 to the grays, it operates continuously, regardless of
the switch position.  This suggests that the switch is not properly shutting
down the +12 to one set of the grays, and that perhaps the grays are "fused
together"

Anyone out there with EE skills and fixed H/L washers?

Thanks in Advance!
