The sun has returned to sunny Florida and it is causing "fix A/C" to 
bubble up to the top of my priority list. The problem is no doubt a 
freon leak (as the A/C worked when I bought the car in December) but 
before I take it in, I was hoping someone could explain the nature of 
a modification made by the PO's wrench. 

The PO had a gizmo called "The Liquid Modulator (tm)" installed
about three years ago in a desperate attempt to improve A/C output.
I have a card that lists the recommended freon charge (32oz) and
system pressures (low: 30psi, high 195psi), but that is all I know.
Can anyone fill me in on exactly what this device is and what info I
should give the service techs before they work on the system?

On a different note, has anyone had success having their A/C serviced 
at a non-Porsche shop? I'm not looking to have them replace any 
components, just charge the system and locate the leak. Is the system 
on an '88 Carrera conventional enought that an ordinary A/C shop can 
do that much, or will I be wasting my time? Any insights would be 
appreciated :-)
