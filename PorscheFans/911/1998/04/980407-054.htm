I agree.  This approach seems similar to Usenet.  Both the web and newgroups 
are not as accessible to me as email.  I can get email from a Telnet window on 
a friend's computer if I have to.  The web is also slower for me due to
the overhead of my browser.  

I agree that a software upgrade is needed.  But I was hoping that the
reliability is what changes, not the features or the way it is accessed.
