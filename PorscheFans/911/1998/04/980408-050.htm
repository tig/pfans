Eric,

My GUESS would be that the S-02's would offer better performance in 
the dry too.  The Tirerack rates the S-02 as max performance and the 
RE-71 as ultra (one step lower).  But like I say, I'm only guessing.  
You will probably get a good answer in you fire this question off to 
sales@tirerack.com.  

And be careful of some of the other responses that you get.  There is no
lack of supply of EXPERTS.  Several weeks ago at a TT at Thunder Hill
the GGR PCA had a pretty wet day on Saturday.  Of course, I was on my
Hooiser comp DOT tires in the rain.  An expert came up to me and said
that the Hooisers were probably still better in the conditions than
my S-02's would be.  I was doubtful, but when he offered that F1 cars
would still be on slicks in those conditions, I knew it was time for 
the boots.

Here are my data points for that weekend.  I'm comparing my times in
my '97 C4S with another C4S that I compete against alot.  We both have
euro-spec suspension.  In the wet on Saturday, my best time on Hooisers
was a 2:50, his on S-02's was 2:35.  And I wasn't limping around.  In
my last session, I pushed way too hard, ignored a couple of signs to
myself that I was over driving and looped it at 75+ mph.  Dumb, dumb, Dan
won't have a pretty car much longer if he keeps that up.  So, Saturday 
evening I decided to do a favor for everyone that stayed for Sunday and 
I switched to my "wet setup" S-02's.  Sunday was nice and sunny.  I got 
down to 2:19 on S-02's as opposed to a 2:25 best that the other C4S did 
on a dry Friday.  Using a simple minded formula, I get 2:25-2:19+2:50-2:35 
= 21s per lap difference.  There are plenty of other factors, but that is 
still a BIG number.

Cheers,

-dj
