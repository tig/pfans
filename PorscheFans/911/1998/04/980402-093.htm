Jeff - were you asking a question about the oil level gauge at the end of
your post?  

If so, what you see is entirely normal.  When the car sits overnight or
longer a lot of oil drains out of the tank into the engine sump.  So tank is
always low on startup.  Then you run the car.  This puts this oil back into
tank.  However, tank (and gauge) still tends to read low, because at
driving RPMs some oil is busy circulating and not sitting in the tank. 
Which is why the instructions for measuring oil call for a hot engine and
a few minutes of idle before measuring.  Which should also be the time
when the gauge reads highest.

Make sense?

If you weren't asking, sorry.

Walt Fricke (who read his oil level cold once on dip stick, filled tank,
promptly spilled some excess oil when car got hot zooming around a
race track, and learned something as a result)
