Jeff- Try Windward Performance at 800-642-1348. The gun drilled torsion
bars that they sell are Glenn Sanders bars. I bought mine thru them. As it
turns out the total cost for four was maybe $30 or so cheaper thru Windward
rather than Glenn Sanders. I called Glenn Sanders originally, but the bars
I wanted were out of stock at the moment. They suggested I call Windward.
Go figure.
