Going to 21/27 increases stiffness by 55.7% and 57% f/r which is a good
match. I have 21/27 and it works well for me but I also have adjustable
sway bars and had to stiffen the front sway bar a lot to dial out the
resulting oversteer (for a '74 with 23mm stock rear t-bars).   22/28
will also work well
but no personal experience here.

21/26 results in 56%/36% rate increase which would result in 
more UNDERsteer (all else being equal).  I don't think you want this
combo
w/o adjustable sway bars to fine tune it.

Check out http://home.ptd.net/~psprechr/tbars.htm for more info on
choosing and installing torsion bars.  I included the table below: 

 Year       Model       Front Rear
 1965-68    911/912           18    23
 1969-77    911/912/912E      18.8        23
 1978-85*   911         18.8  24.1
 1986-89    911         18.8  25
 1975-89    930         18.8  26

* some sources say '80-'85 had 24.1 bars 

 StockFront = 18.8      Stock Rear = 23   Stock Rear = 24.1
 21 mm : 55.7 %   26 mm : 63 %            26 mm : 35.5%
 22 mm : 87.5 %   27 mm : 90 %            27 mm : 57 %
 23 mm : 124 %          28 mm : 120 %           28 mm : 82 %
 N/A              29 mm : 153 %           N/A
