First, I think there may have been some misunderstanding of my question
with regard to "blue" headlight bulbs.  Based on my reading of several of
the responses, I think they thought I was asking about saturated or pure
blue lights.  I should have stated that the light is an extremely
unsaturated blue light, i.e., white light with a tint of blue.

The be specific my colleague (who really is a world-class vision scholar)  said

I am a human factors engineer who has worked in cockpit design and in
computer interfaces.  The comments about cockpit lighting are technically
true, but have several confounds.  Historically cockpit lights were red to
help pilots maximize their dark adaption  But it was found that the use of
red was unnecessary because the standard night light levels are well above
those theoretical levels one could achieve via the red light medium.
Besides the red lights masked red symbols on maps, checklists, etc...so the
trade-off was not that good.  The U.S. Air Force & Navy have settled on
white light with a very slight blue tint as current the cockpit standard.

Traditional monochromatic computer display hues (green & amber) were
selected on the basic of phosphors available and cost.  Believe me human
factors issues were the last thing on their mind - except when it was time
to market.

I think I am going to invest $12 on one bulb and do a little "empirical"
research.  I will replace one of bulbs with an identical wattage "blue'
bulb and do a little observation.  If the blue bulbs are not superior I may
even tell my dept chair that i was doing a little preliminary work on a
research proposal addressing landing lights and have him pay for the bulb.
;-)

I will pass on my results when completed.
