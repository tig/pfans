Hello everyone:

I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my cry for help.This list is
GREAT!!!. Thanks to the advise of several of you I was able to get the plug
out last night. The plug was broken off just below the hex part. The
ceramic part was also broken off such that I couldn't get a grasp on it to
get it out.I used a vacuum pump to vacuum out any pieces of ceramic that
might have broken off (I didn't see any, but just in case). I then rotated
the engine to build up pressure in the cylinder. The remaining ceramic
piece popped right out. Boy what a great sound that was (better than a
bottle of good champagne).I vacuumed the hole again then used an easy out
and the plug came right out. I was able to have a clear view of what was
going on with the use of a mirror and flashlight.

I hope I never have this experience again but if I do I will be prepared
(Thanks to this list).

Thanks again,

Ron (one relieved Porsche addict)
