To Robert Herbert re: Tube in 'smuggler's boot':

That tube is connected to the thermostst in the console and it is filled with freon
R12 so that it can expand and contract with the changes in temp of the evap. coil. If
it wasn't there the coil would simply freeze up each time you used the a/c.

Call Dianna @ 714-634-9184 to get replacement.
