Dear Pfans -- I have a 1971 911T with a hand throttle that is 
currently inoperative. In pulling up the boot and rug I can clearly 
see through a sight hole a small collar with set screw fastened to the throttle cable, but 
there seems to be no connection to the hand throttle handle. I did 
poke around the handbrake/heater/hand throttle assembly, take out the 
three bolts holding the assembly to the floor and moved things 
around a bit, but I simply could not understand how this all fits 
together and what should be done correctly and with minimal pain to get this to work again. It did 
work about a year ago, but after service it was disconnected by a 
local mechanic, and I was hoping for a fix at home without a return. Any 
help out there?
Best wishes
