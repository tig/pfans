This is my first post, so please bear with me:

1984 911 Targa  95,000mi, stock w/ factory "sport" suspension option -daily
driver, 3rd owner, new to me 4 months,  Los Angeles, CA.

3 questions:

1) Clutch pedal super hard to push in and 1st and 2nd gear hard to shift
into.  At stoplights its a hard push on the clutch, 4 count shift into 1st,
shudder and go.  I am guessing the following may be faulty:  Clutch helper
spring, synchros, clutch plate etc.  If I have the mechanic start, is there
anything that I should add on for preventative maintenance / improvement?
If the clutch needs to be redone, is there any specific advice anyone would
like to offer?

2) The two center clips one the Targa top pop off the frame when the car
flexes a lot.  I have replaced the clips with bigger ones (Performance
Parts) yesterday.  I don't know if they will do the trick, but I wanted to
solicit opinions on how I could economically improve the stiffness of the
car.  Please list in order of "Bang for the Buck".

3) I had most of the rubber (Targa, doors, etc) replaced and now there is a
howling wind noise coming from the front of the doors (just below the window
I think).  Anyone have similar experiences, solutions?

Thanks in advance,

-Sean
