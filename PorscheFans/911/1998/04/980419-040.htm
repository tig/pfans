Greetings.  I apologize to all those who've been sending me mail, I
do try to get these articles out more frequently but life keeps
getting in the way.

PORSCHING  by Chris Welty
Hudson-Valley Region, PCA

A Dream Come True


Granted, it is the dream of many people.  People who like to go
fast.  People who know what trail braking and late-apexing mean.
People who attend track events at Lime Rock sponsored by the
Hudson-Valley Region, per capita the most enthusiastic region of the
PCA when it comes to driver's ed.

I stand there, by my car, the heat from the pavement rising up in
palpable waves.  I remember my first time ever at the track, standing
in the very same posture, sweating the very same sweat.  That time,
however, I was nauseous and trembling with fear as I stood there
waiting for my instructor.  Not this time.  I may have been trembling,
just a little, but not with fear. This time it was anticipation and
maybe a little nervousness.  I'm not worthy...

A car pulls into the pits, depositing someone in full driving regalia.
He unfastens his helmet and removes it for a breath of fresh air. His
hair, matted, his face, covered with sweat, he saunters over to me,
taking a swig from a water bottle.

"You next?"

"Uhhh....yeah."  There goes thirty years of education right down the
drain.  It's probably one of the few things I'll ever say to this guy
and I manage something that profound?  Why couldn't I have said, "It
is a tale, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."

"OK, just give me a second and we can go.  You want me to drive it?"

"Sure, suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune if you
must."  Yes!  I got something in.

"You have heatstroke or something?"

"Errr....no.  You can drive, sure.  I'm Chris."

"Derek Bell, pleased to meet you."

When it broke into the drivers ed arena a few years ago, the
Hudson-Valley Region of the PCA (known fondly as HVR) immediately
distinguished itself with the "drive until your arms fall off" day, as
then organizer Jeff Harrison described it - three run groups and over
two and a half hours of track time each.

Over time, this event had become something of a legend, but to further
distinguish itself, HVR track chairman Henk Westerduin began something
unprecedented - HVR began something of a "make a wish" foundation.  It
is "something" of a make a wish foundation because it isn't for
children, it's for adults.  It also isn't for terminally ill or even
mildly ill adults, it's for healthy ones.  It also doesn't grant just
any wish, in fact it grants only one: healthy adults who are
experienced drivers can have a celebrity driver for an instructor.
For a modest additional fee, which simply covers the driver's expenses
to be there, anyone could make their dreams come true and get advice
from such drivers as David Murray, Hurley Haywood, Price Cobb, or
Derek Bell.

I try not to look like an idiot as I circle around to the passenger
seat and strap myself in.  Derek adjusts his mirrors, blips the
throttle, and within a heartbeat we are off.  We tear out of the pits
and immediately into Big Bend, a decreasing radius turn of which most
drivers agree, "there are a thousand ways to drive it and they're all
wrong."

"Hmmm.....tires a bit over-inflated." Derek murmurs.  

I pull out my note pad and scribble down the comment.  "I hope you
don't mind if I take a few notes.  I'd like to put this experience
into my column."

"Right...bit of understeer here..." We are coming out of Big Bend into
the short straight that is the entrance to the Esses.  I scribble.

"Come on...come on...there we go...point the car, eh?"  The car begins
to rotate.

"Point the car."  I mumble, jotting some more.  Through the left
hander and into the right hander.

"Important turn here," Derek's voice begins to rise.  He swoops thru
the turn, overtaking a turbo.  We dive underneath and he shifts into
fourth.  "Keep your speed and momentum up for the uphill turn.  Don't
back away from it."

"I usually brake about here," I comment, perhaps anxiously.

Derek says nothing, does nothing.  "Seems a slightly skittish." He
says carelessly as we fly into the uphill turn.

"It does that when it's sideways," I comment between clenched teeth.

We pass a few cars and head for West Bend.  "Coming up is the downhill
turn," he lectures, taking the racing line past one last car and
rotating the car into the apex.  "Most important turn on the track.
You've got to carry your momentum through that turn."  My car is four
wheel drifting to the track-out point.  "When the car hits the bottom
of the hill, it will get heavy.  You've got to apply the most
cornering force there.  Then the car will lighten up, as the
suspension recovers.  You must be ready to reduce the steering input
at that point.  And of course..."

"Don't lift," I finish.  We tear under the bridge, careening downhill
recklessly towards the final turn.  The holy grail of all racetracks -
the turn before the main straight.

I'm quite sure this experienced race driver would not wreck my car,
but my mind and my senses are not in agreement.  If Derek could see my
face, he would recognize a surpressed scream.  "We're not going to make
it," is the best I can muster, summoning images of the sinking
Titanic.

"You're right. Damn," he replies calmly, shaking his head.

"I'M RIGHT?  WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAA...."  Through the downhill and
onto the main straight, the full power of my recently, lovingly,
rebuilt engine going thru the rubber and onto the asphalt as we track
all the way out.

"I thought for sure we'd catch that Carrera," he finishes.

"Catch Carrera...." I return quickly to my mumbling/jotting behavior.  

One more time around with slightly fewer screams, and Derek returns to
the pits.  He turns to me.  "Ready to drive?"

"Sure. Yes.  Of course."  We switch positions and I adjust the seat
and belts.  "Of course I'm just...ahhhhh...recovering from a cold and
not up to full strength."

"No problem.  Just don't sneeze on me."

"Sneeze on you," I chortle.  "Good one, Derek."  That definitely
seemed forced.

We pull out onto the track, and I try my hardest to impress.

"You're trying too hard." Is his immediate reaction.  "Let the car do
some work.  Don't jerk the wheel around.  Be smooth."

"I'm sure I've said that a hundred times to students of my own.  Maybe
let me just do a lap to get the jitters out and then you can start
instructing."

"Fair enough," he agrees.

Next lap.  We're heading for the uphill turn.  "Don't be so hard on
the brakes here!" he comments.  "Hey!  What are you doing????"

"Just jotting that down," I reply.

"Steer into the bloody turn!" he shouts hysterically.  

"Jeez, a tad squeamish today, Derek?"  I reply, rolling my eyes and
returning my hands to the wheel.

"I think you should take notes after we are thru driving."

"By then I'll have forgotten any good jokes."  We creep up the uphill,
being passed by several cars.  "How about if you take notes?"

"Oh if you insist.  Just keep both hands on the wheel."

---- 

This guy is insane, I've never seen anyone with quite so little
understanding of the basic...whoa...  "Try to keep the car on the
driving line," I suggest.

"The driving line.  Right," he replies.  I think his name is Charles.

"This is West Bend, don't turn in so late."  I think perhaps he should
pay for a few more sessions.

"How am I doing here, Derek?" he asks as we exit West Bend and proceed
towards the downhill turn.

"Perhaps you should work up to what I did, don't try it all at once.
Try this one with just a bit less braking."  

I'm scared.  Perhaps this wasn't such a great idea.

"That was pretty good!" I lie. "I think the car has too much rake."  
Blame the car.  Too much orange tape, too.

"Rake, right.  Could you make a note of that, Derek?"  he requests.

NOTE:  TOO MUCH RAKE.  REMOVE ORANGE TAPE.

How much am I getting paid for this?

"You're writing an awful lot there, Derek," he observes.

NOTE: carry more speed thru Big Bend.
NOTE: point the car in the left hander.
NOTE: apply throttle earlier in the right hander.
NOTE: don't brake so hard in the uphill, and turn in earlier.
NOTE: don't turn in so late for west bend.  Carry more speed.
NOTE: get on the throttle earlier in all turns.
NOTE: be smoother, think about the transition from braking to
      throttle and carry momentum.

I've gotten writer's cramp already.

----

Back into the pits and Derek seems a bit exhausted.  I drop him off
and he points out the notes he took during my driving.  "Not bad for
your first time," he smiles, salutes, and saunters over to another car
waiting on pit row.

"It wasn't my first time, " I reply in confusion, but he didn't seem
to hear me.  I look at the notes.  Hmmm, at least I didn't do as bad
as this Charles guy...

I realize most people have difficulty separating fact from fiction in
my writings, though in my own defense anything I write is many times
more factual that most "based on a true story" movies.  Of this
experience I will only say this: the Hudson-Valley Region really does
have celebrity drivers on hand as instructors.  This year, HVR will
feature Derek Bell and Price Cobb at our September 24th Driver's
Education at Lime Rock Park.  Contact Henk Westerduin, HVR Track
Chair, at (914) 534-5022, for more information.  Sign up early, this
event fills up fast.
