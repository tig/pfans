Thanks for replying Denny.

I have an 84 turbo, and as you mentioned, the flat plastic thingie has no
"friend" on my car to connect to.  I'm going to post this to the list with
the prayers that someone out there has wired this and can give me a key.  My
next step was to call BW.  "Less than caring" was not a phrase I was hoping
to hear!

I'm not sure what car you have. If it's an 87 or newer you sholud only have
to use the plugs on your wiring harness as their the round 6 pin should be
the same as the replacement light.
To open the thing up there is a little hole in the bottom with a sliding
plastic groove that a flat screw driver will fit in. Move this about 3/4" of
an
inch
one way or the other and turn the mirror upside down while holding the glass
and it comes right off, the glass that is.
It's really ingenious once you see how it works.....
I have an 86 and have to create a plug that goes from my wiring harness up
to
the
flat plug soo let me know what you hear from others.....
Hope this helps, I'm glad i'm not the only one who thought the instructions
were BS, and BW is not real "caring" ......
