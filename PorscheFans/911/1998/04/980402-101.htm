Hey Doug, you'll be seeing mine at lots of events real soon.
Here's the story; I've been looking for a 911 for about 3-4 years on and off.
During that time my wife and I have gone thru a 944, 2 Nissan 300ZX twin
turbos, a Jaguar XJS (real piece of crap) wife wanted it!!!!!! A '92 Vette, a
Mazda Miata (wife wanted that piece of crap also!!!!!)
Wife decided she din't want to be a wife anymore last year, and took my 520HP
Stillen 300 Twin Turbo with her.  So the search for the 911 got real serious.
In Sept. I called about a '83 turbo look, it was gone.  The guy I spoke to
owned California Porsche Restoration in Fallbrook, Ca.. Called me back with
info on a '83 930 slant with 2400 miles on it (engine was stolen, and
recovered) .  Flew down to Ca. on Sept 28 with 20K, and bought it.  It had
some damage to the left front fender, so we worked out a deal to have them fix
that (I'm an Ex-custom paint/body man) 
It worked out cheaper that me doing it myself, since I also found a front clip
in Ca. and I would have had to pay to ship it back.
Deal was, I buy the clip for $2500, the hang the fender and keep the other
fender and hood!  Sounded like a good deal right?  Wrong!  Took the A-holes 6
months to hang a $^%*#@ fender!
It finally was delivered on Monday 3/32.
I had the car completelly stripped down, interior and trim, and the
engine/trans out by Saturday.  Hell, I did more work in 5 days than they did
in 6 months.
Anyone in CA. thinking about were to take there car for body/paint work, go
anywhere but CPR (also known as Main Street Auto) in Fallbrook!!!
Anyway, it's now ready for its final color (Ruby Red Pearl).
Hope to be able to spray it this weekend, put the engine in by next weekend,
and get on the road by the end on June......I think thats a conservative
estimate.
You'll know it when you see it.
