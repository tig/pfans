Hey all,

I'm sorry that I filled your boxes up with updates, questions,
then nevermind I found the answer!! I got a little too excited
about having a wrenching project again.

No, I did not get any nasty grams, every reply was very helpfull..
Thank you all!!..

I just feel that I went a bit overboard thus the apology. I'll try
to maintain my control when I hit the PC :)

Just a note, With all my haste a few of my questions were answered
by me just taking a closer look. Like the sway bar bushing cups. A
list member emailed me a pointer and I checked out Pelicans site
and found the answer, so when I went to the car with printed paper
in my hand I actually looked more closely and there is already a
template 1" hole and triangle from the factory (they just didn't
cut it out since it's a 74, first year of no through the body sway
bars!).. There was my answer all a long.

I also picked up a free standing 12 ton press as I needed it in
the past and again with the new bushings.. Harbor Freight $99.95,
not a bad price and a must have tool for the garage, as well as
some other air tools :)

Again thank you all so very much for your help, pointers,
suggestions, and just general chit chat, this is a great list and
I'll try not to clutter it in the future :)

74 911 w/stuff...

I have to chime in and agree with some others, a searchable
archive would be very beneficial and cut down on some of the most
common questions...
