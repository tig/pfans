<< 
 Maybe some one was taking all the oil and gas out in 1970 and replacing it
with hot air !!!
 
 By guessing and estimating high, this is the best I could do to reconcile the
difference.
 
 The 72 v 73 914's were about 100 lbs difference. There were no changes in the
trans or other major components except for door beams and maybe more
insulation. Do you know if the 72 911's have door beams? >>

No, just an extra piece of sheet metal inside the door skin. that
did make the 73 a bit heavier. Also the 73 had more oil capacity.

<< If I remember right, I looked in the trunk and motor compartment of a 70
911 and it did not have as much insulation sprayed on the earlier cars. I did
not look in the wheel wells.  I also seem to recall that at some point the
factory began experimenting on the earlier cars with some limited galvanizing
in the floor, even before the full treatment that began in 1976. >>

Yes my '72S has galvanized floors.
 
<< Mabie we could assume that the door beams and insulation did add 100 lbs,
like on the 914. >>

The 914 also had moveable passenger seat (before was not a "real" seat).
 
<< Some one replied that the 72 was the first for the inertia belts. Mabie 20
lbs more, max? >>

Could be!
 
<< Also, I don't know if the 1970's had a charcoal canister and venting. With
lines Maybe about an extra 25 lbs. >>

More like 15 I'd think.
  
<< As you say the rear body work dose not weigh much in steel, so maybe 10 lbs
for the alloy rear. >>

10 pounds MAX.
  
<< I am guessing, 35 lbs for the 915.
  
 I think the 70 S had a remote oil cooler. Some of the early S's only had
these as an option. Maybe a 40 lb weight with the extra oil. >>

the '72S had the oil cooler only if AC or if ordered that way.
 
>> This would get us close at about 230 lbs.
  
 I think the factory may have also misrepresented the horse power difference.
  
My limited knowledge is that a change in compression from 8.5 to 9.5 to 1
makes a 5% difference in HP. The 2.2S had 9.8 to 1 CR for about 6% more HP per
cc. The increase in displacement from 2195 to 2341 is about 6% which should
create a brake even for the loss in compression in 1972. The cams and ports
stayed the same.Thus the HP should have been about the same. >>

It's very hard to say compression gives 5%, probably less in this
particular engine. Bob White said that after 8.5 to 1 the increase
is very small.
 
<< I bet the factory did not want to say there bigger motor put out the same
HP and the car gained weight, so they had to look a little closer at there
dyno figures. >>

It certainly gained some torque and driveability.
  
<< If there was a real 250 lb weight difference, I would think the 70/71 S
would be faster on the track as the tires and motor would have about 10% less
to do. 
 
 I still think a 72 911 S is about the coolest Porsche ever made. (Some are
calling it "the poor man's RS".)
  >>

I agree! I miss the power surge of my '72S at 5500-7300 on my RS as the 2.7
RS a very flat torque curve. But the immediate torque at 4000 RPMs
more than makes up for it. My RS feels as fast in 5th at 100MPH
as in 4th but checking my trap speed at Lime Rock yesterday showed that
I should hold 4th gear until at least 7000 RPM (118 or so). In the
S there is no question about shifting at redline.
