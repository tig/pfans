Chris:

"One" doesn't; one's BODY SHOP does.  You need to find a body shop
that knows how to deal with insurance companies.

A hint:  If your insurance company gives you a list of shops that 
they've "pre-approved" to fix your car, the one you want won't be 
on that list.

Why?  Easy... The shops on that list are there because their
policies regarding "proper" repairs are exactly the same as your
insurance company's, and your insurance company doesn't care about
your car NEARLY as much as you do.

If you're a PCA member, call the body shops that advertise in your 
local region's newsletter and talk to their owners... Ask them the 
same question you posed to the Pfans list, and see what they say.
  
You can get an idea of their level of experience by asking which 
insurance companies are the easiest for them to work with.  If they 
say that all insurance companies are about the same, move on; 
some companies are MUCH more generous than others, so if the shop 
owner has no preference, it means that he has no ability or desire to 
negotiate with them.

P.S.  State Farm -- around here in Southern California, at least -- 
      is generally regarded as one of the WORST insurers for a body
      shop to deal with.  After your car's fixed, you might think
      about changing to an insurer that your body shop recommends.
