Hi mystery person with '87 Carrera,
  I've used the OEM Porsche pads and Pagids. The OEM pads were great
on the street and at roughly $25 mail order, very reasonably priced. 
On the track they seemed to deposit material on the rotor when they
got hot. Under braking they would sort of grind or growl once this
happened.
  I switched to Pagids Orange and Coolbrake ducts last year and love them. 
I got the equivalent of 14 days of DE events and used them on the street
without any squealing save the first stop in the morning backing out
of my garage. No more dust than the OEM I think (not bad). They seem
to be very easy on rotors too. 
 I have an '86 Carrera, the OEM pad price and Pagid noise opinions are 
based on this application. You guys with newer cars (4 piston calipers)
will pay more than $25 for OEM pads and the Pagids will probably make 
dogs howl.
