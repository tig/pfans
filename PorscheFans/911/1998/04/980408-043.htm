A guy emailed me some time ago that he had been very successful in
replacing various fans in his 911 with fans from junkyard VW's. You
basically have to take the fan to the yard and compare it up against VW
parts. The Bosch numbers, in all likelihood, will not be the same even
though the fans are. Bosch is very, very good about putting custom numbers
on similar or identical parts. Of course, the same fan for Porsche may
undergo more rigorous testing than one destined for a VW, but a fan is a
fan.
