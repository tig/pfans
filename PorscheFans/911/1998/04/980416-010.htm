Just had the beast smog checked in Florida and failed on the CO test at
idle.  State limit is 5.0% mine showed 6.55%. HC in PPM was ok at 298 with
a limit of 500 and CO2 of 10.8% . At the running test of 28MPH at about
3000 rpm the readings showed 1.47% and 65.

From the collective wisdom.  

1) How much will valves that need a bit of adjusting effect these readings.

2) I am really assuming that the engine is running a bit rich.  How in the
devil does one adjust to a leaner mixture.  I have seen in Hayes and in the
list of adjusting with the long hex tool at the fuel distributor but for
the life of me I cannot see where this opening to make the adjustment is
located.  

3) Any other places to check out that I may easily overlook? 

Any and all help or suggestions on how to get this idle reading down will
be greatly appreciated.  Would just as soon do this myself instead of
bringing it into the wrench where I can never escape for less than $500.00
( while you are in there why not.....)

TIA

leak coming from and why do they always have to drip directly on the heat
exchangers?)
