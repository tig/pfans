In response to my post:
<<For PorscheFan readers, would it help if there was a list of repairs with an
"ease-of-repair" numerical index like the above? Perhaps one of those famous
Clic and Clac IQ/green thumb/how many kids you got vs. time continuum/post tax
payment dollars and dealership owner boat payment matrices we doodle with in
our free time. I realize skill levels vary but it might offer some insight as
to the relative complexity of a procedure. Let's start with locating the gas
tank filler on a
'72 911. This would be a 1?>>

<<I know I would really appreciate a rule of thumb index myself>>

Eric,
Okay, I'll start. I'm not sure this is going to work, but I hope others on the
list can help complete this task. To give it some order, let's divide the car
into systems, the same way repair manuals do it:

-	Engine
-	Fuel 
-	Exhaust
-	Cooling
-	Brakes
-	Electrical
-	Front suspension
-	Rear suspension
-	Drivetrain
-	Emissions
-	Body
-	Accessories
-	HVAC (heating, ventilation, A/C)

I'm going to start off with the front of the car, front suspension. Caveat
emptor: My experience deals only with 911's (early ones at that); not 993's,
964's, 968's or 962's, and I haven't personally done everything there is to
do, but in this area of the 911 things haven't changed all that much. In
addition, the difficulty level numbers are relative. One person's 5 could be
another person's 3. Remember, this is to help initiate those who haven't done
these procedures yet. Time should not be as much of a factor compared to
difficulty.

Difficulty level: 1-10, with the following scale; 1 = changing oil/filter, 10
= rebuilding transmission.

Description					Difficulty level		Misc. notes

Adjust ride height				    1-2					914's have similar frt. susp.
Adjust frt. whl. bearings		    2-3
Add strut support bar			    2-3
Remove factory sway bar ('74 on)	3
Add sway bar ('74 on)				3
R&R front suspension/steer. rack	3
R&R shocks						3-4
R&R torsion bars					3-4
R&R frt. whl. bearings				3-4
Add sway bar (up to '74)			4					includes a-arm/body adapters
R&R tie rods						4
Install Turbo tie rods				5
Align 								6-7												
R&R control arm					?
R&R ball joints					?

Hey, do I have a life? Gotta get back to work. I'm hoping others can pick up
the slack, but I'll peek in once in a while.
