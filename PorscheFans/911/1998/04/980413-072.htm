For those keeping score ... I goofed yesterday on my post about the Keno
chip ... it is in fact a Keno (not Keho) chip, has KRT (Keno Racing Team)
printed on it.

Then, serendipity. ... Europroducts *just* put this chip on sale for $169,
so if you've ever toyed with chipping your 84-89 Carrera, I doubt you'd
find one cheaper (a local Porsche dealer has the same chip for twice the
price). And, if you don't like it, you get your money back after a 30-day
trial.

I bought one today ... but couldn't figure out how to unhook the cable from
the DME box under the seat in my 88 Carrera ... didn't want to give it a
real hard yank or anything ... any advice?

And in another stupid question ... how does one tuck the bottom of an
aftermarket shiftboot in to the shifter console (at least I managed to get
the knob off!)? Do I need to remove the console itself, and how is it
connected?

I'll post my opinions on the chip if anyone's interested.

Here's the posting Europroducts made to alt.autos.porsche yesterday, in
case you all don't troll the newsgroups as well:

Yes ... his name's really John Madden, and no, it's not the same guy ...

Europroducts number is 888-808-8821 ... I'm not connected with them in any
way, just happen to live near them.

1988 Targa (soon to have a chip, I hope)
