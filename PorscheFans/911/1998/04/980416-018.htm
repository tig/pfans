First off, I must thank the P-fans list.  I just sold my 72T through the list
(to a list member) which enabled me to buy a 84 carrera.  I have a few
questions about the car.  

1. I believe the shocks are original to the car.  I think they are green
Bilstiens or maybe Boge's can any one tell me what shocks are stock to the
car.  

2. The car has 114K.  What repairs should I expect at this kind of mileage.
Had an engine oil test done.  It passed with flying colors.  What if anything
does this test mean.

3. the trans. is hard to shift into 2nd and 3rd, down shifting is also hard.
I replaced the bushing under the shift lever which seemed to help a little.  I
have the bushing for the coupling that i'm going to replace. Is there any
other adjustments that I may be able to make that might help. Or is this a
sign of a trans going bad? P.S. the lever seems sloppy both when in gear and
in neutral.

4. the car has been lowered and has Welt. Adj. sway bars.  How can I tell how
or why I would want to adj. the bars.  I plan on doing some autox's and a few
drivers eds.


Thanks in advance to all.
