One that I will survey here, does anyone have any experience with
"paintless dent removal"?  My 911 has one small concave dent on the
roof, no
scratch - no seam, looks like a softball or something got it.  The car
is
otherwise perfect, and although I can probably live with it I would lke
to
have it smooth. Is only about 2" across at it's widest point and maybe
1/4"
deep at the most.  Difficult to even see unless the sun hits it right.

I have an 83SC.  Recently I had it serviced at Freddy Baker's place in
Bedford Ohio.  They offered the services of one of the dent wizard
types.  For about $165  I got a fifty cent piece size dent near my
driver's door done as well as some other minor dents and one major
crease in my engine compartment lid (put there by a Porsche CAN person
several years ago at a clinic!).
I am very pleased with the result except that at a certain angle I can
see the paint is slightly odd looking in the area of the larger dent.  I
think that this was due to the paint surface having been distorted so
long in the dent.  Otherwise it looks great...and only someone
determined to find something wrong probably could find this one blemish.
For the money and the result it is great.  I would do it again.  Beats
the snot out of pounding, filling, sanding, and painting.
WSC 83SC slate blue and perfectly smooth now thank you very much
.
