You've opened up quite a can of worms with this synthetic brake fluid thing (
it's even worse than the oil ;-). I'll give you my experience which comes from
having synthetic brake fluid in my car for over ten years, not just anecdotal
stories. First the negatives:

1/ To do it you MUST rebuild you entire system - all the calipers, master
cylinder, and flush out all the lines with brake cleaner. Do not let normal
fluid anywhere, even to lubricate the pistons when you reassemble you calipers.
Use the proper ATE piston lubricant (note : it's expensive so maybe a mechanic
will sell you a squirt).

2/ It's trickier to bleed than normal fluid so expect to go through a lot.
Whereas normal fluid loves water, silicone fluid loves air. Pour gently and do
not shake the bottle or do anything to get little air bubbles in it. Use a
pressure bleed system with low pressure (just enough to move the fluid -
usually under 10 lb..) We don't want to introduce any extra air or worse yet,
empty the reservoir. A few gravity bleeds will help as well. 

3/ The pedal feel will still not be quite as hard as with normal fluid but it
is very good (this assumes you paid close attention to #2).

4/ After time (as I said over 10 years) the rubber seals will swell slightly.
This caused some sticky piston problems in the calipers that required a
rebuild. The condition of the rubber will not deteriorate as the silicone fluid
preserves rubber.

Now the positives:

1/ Silicone fluid will not absorb moisture - the mortal enemy of brake systems.

2/ It won't harm paint if spilled on it.

3/ Because of #1 above you do not need to change you brake fluid yearly, or
even before track events (I can hear the gasps now). I ran track events with my
10 year old fluid and never once had an over heating or brake related failure.

4/ When I did redo my calipers they were mint inside. It's the first time I
ever took apart a caliper that looked as good as when I put it together.
Remember this fluid was never changed!

So in the end I can make these recommendations - if your car is stored a lot (I
live along the Atlantic coast - lots of moisture) I highly recommend it. It's
in my 356 as we speak (write?). If however optimum pedal hardness is your goal
for track use and/or your techies require you to bleed your fluid before events
anyway (my 911 has it for that reason now), then stick to the regular stuff -
its cheaper if you have to throw it out. Just remember one thing, it does work
and work very well, if you do it properly and it can't be beat in cars that see
limited usage (is that more than one thing?). Take a few short cuts however and
you'll one of the ones who swear it's junk. Good luck.
