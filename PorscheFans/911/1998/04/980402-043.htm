     Generally speaking, IRS (street) cars have rear spring rates that 
     softer than their Live Axle counterparts because of lower unsprung 
     weights.  Low unsprung weight is very desirable in getting a tire to 
     stay on the pavement over high speed bumps since it mass is low and 
     allows the suspension to respond quickly.  Drag Race style starts 
     'cause torque reactions in the suspension that make the tire "climb"
     up.  A live axle equipped car generally has a high unsprung weight in 
     the rear suspension since the differential, driveshaft, rear axle 
     itself, and the control arms, Panhard rods, etc are all "unsprung".  
     This high mass helps keep the tires on the ground and allow them to 
     "hook".  The IRS car only has the halfshaft and control arms, springs, 
     etc as unsprung weight so getting the car to "hook" would take some 
     brutally stiff springs and highly damped shock absorbers. 
     
      Its ironic that I'm trying to REDUCE unsprung weight on my Mustang GT 
     for better Roadracing/Autocrossing virtues.  There is a huge chasm 
     between its handling characteristics (and power) and my 914's.  But of 
     course, each car is especially good at certain things, and changing 
     either of the beasts natures is VERY challenging.
