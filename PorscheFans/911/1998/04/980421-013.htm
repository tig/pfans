Hello P-fans!

Hoping someone might be able to shed some light on this 'problem' that I'm
experiencing.

My '79 930 used to start up on the first try everytime.  The previous owner
had jerry-rigged a fuel cutoff switch and did a poor job of it.  My wrench
took out all of the useless wiring and accidently unhooked the fuel pump
wire so that the car wouldn't start (it just kept turning over)  He found
the disconnected wire and the car started.

However, the car will not start until the third try now.  It is almost as
if the fuel line is drained and it takes three tries before it is filled
up.  Does this make any sense?

Any insight as to where I can look to see what is causing this new ailment.
I can take it back to the wrench, but he won't be able to get to the car
for about a week or so and if it is an easy fix, I would prefer to do it
myself.  :-)


Thanks for any assistance.

Troy
