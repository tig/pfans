Jad,

As promised, here is the technical data on the 964 and 993 C4 AWD systems: 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
964 C4:

The 964 C4 uses a completely mechanical (planetary gear) system. This
systems weighs twice as much as the system used in the 993 C4 and has
almost twice the power loss. The normal torque split is 31 percent front,
69 percent rear (31/69). The torque split can be varied from 0/100 to
100/0. Normal implies no wheel spin. 

993 C4:

The 993 uses a viscous coupling to drive the front wheels. Under normal
conditions, between 5 and 15 percent of the power is applied to the front
wheels. The viscous coupling system requires the speed of the input and
output shafts to be different for ANY power to be transmitted to the front
wheels. The front wheels spin slightly slower than the rear wheels on a
normal surface. This causes the small amount of power to be applied to the
front wheels. The faster the rear wheels spin in relation to the front,
the more power that can applied to the front. Nearly 100 percent of the
power can be applied to the front wheels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what does this all mean? Well, first off, it means what I was saying is
correct. Under normal conditions, the 964 C4 applies at least twice and
sometimes as much as 6 times more power to the front wheels. The 964 C4
system causes a significant amount of understeer because of this. The only
time the 964 C4 would have no power being applied to the front wheels is
if they were on an oil-coated Teflon surface and the rear wheels were on a
nice sticky surface. 

The bottom line is that the 993 C4 handles and drives much more like its
C2 counterpart due to a superior AWD system when compared to the 964 C4
and its AWD system.

I don't think the 964 C4 is a horrible car. For what I want and need, it
is a horrible car. I don't live where it rains or snows most of the time
so I don't need AWD. The 993 C4 is much better but it still is not what I
want or need. If I had to buy one or the other, I would happily spend $20K
more a 993 C4.

Give me a C2 any day and twice on Sunday!!!!
