Hi Tom,
   I strongly reccomend that you go with the roll bar.  We make the 
Brey-Krause stuff and we decided not to make a harness bar for the 
early cars.  In order to mount a harness guide bar you must be sure 
of the strength and integrity of the mounting points.  The early 
shells vary quite a bit and were not designed to take the load even 
when new.  Newer shells are tested and certified to meet very strict 
standards.
   There is more to a harness bar than just drilling a couple of 
holes and bolting in a piece of pipe.  Remember, you have a span from 
window pillar to window pillar and the potential force of two bodies. 
The height and alignment are also critical.  Unless you really know 
what you are doing, you can do more harm than good.

Good Luck,
Dodge
