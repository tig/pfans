Pfans,

I have been looking to purchase a second Porsche as a daily driver and =
have been performing substantial research to that end. Lately some hot =
mail has been flying about C2 v C4 etc. so I though the timing good for =
this treatise. I welcome all insights and feedback as regards its =
subject.

Background:=20

My previous Porsche was a 1987 Carrera Cab my current Porsche is a 1996 =
C4 Cab. I loved my Carrera but compared to my 993 it was like a 'Super =
Cup' Go Kart. I'm seeking a daily driver Porsche as my 993 is not that =
and the Yukon is not much fun.

Carrera v 964:

As stated I loved my 911 but I have driven the 964 C2 and it is quite =
different (to me). I prefer the 964 and pricing can be surprisingly =
close between the 911 Carrera and the 964 depending on year, condition, =
region etc. (particularly by region prices for Porsches are all over the =
place making pricing guides not much of guide). In fact it appears that =
964's are less desirable in the market than 911's when you compare =
original list to current market prices and the percentage reduction, For =
example I sold my 87 911 50,000 mile Cab (with a new top) for $32,500. A =
1990-2 C2 Cab with similar miles can be had for little more than this =
(about $35,000 - $37,000) yet its original sticker was minimum $70,000, =
a drop of 50% in six to eight years. The original sticker on my 911 was =
$55,000 so at my selling price a drop of 40% in eleven years. IMHO, it =
appears that 964's have taken their "hit" and may represent very good =
buys now. I've also noticed that cars five years old or less still carry =
a premium. I think this may due to a 60 month financing factor. e.g. =
cars over five years old have been fully depreciated by financing =
companies and therefore are sold for less, falling in price until they =
reach some intrinsic base market value. As evidence I notice a big drop =
in price between 1993/4 964's and 1991/2 964's.=20

C2 v C4:

The C4 full time AWD system on the 964 caused the car to handle =
improperly (compared to the C2) inducing understeer (Anderson, Frere). =
The 993 C4 was designed to increase strength, reduce weight, to improve =
handling closer to the C2 and to eliminate the excessive understeer of =
the 964 C4 (Batchelor, Frere). The 964 experienced a loss of performance =
from the C2 due to power loss to the front transmission due to friction =
(Frere). The 964 C2 and C4 also had different gear ratios.

It appears to me that with the 993 they got it right hence the AWD Twin =
Turbo v the C2 based 3.6 turbo. Performance for the  993 C2 and C4 is =
identical. The C4 is friendlier (IMHO). Also the 911 GT2 was C2 based =
due to the weight differential between the C2 and C4 (Frere) and the =
Series 1 and Series 2 GT1 cars have carried on from this decision. Will =
the 996 based Turbo be AWD?



Tiptronic v Manual

Although the difference between the two performance wise is obvious =
(although they are rumored to be performance wise the same now given the =
new 996 5 speed Tiptronic) the Tiptronic makes for an easy commute =
(remember this for my daily driver) and from my observation Tiptronic's =
don't command any premium (maybe a discount) over the manuals as =
Tiptronic's are less desirable in the 964 aftermarket than manuals.

The Right Year?

1990 to mid 91 production models may leak at the heads and have the fly =
wheel problem. Obviously with Tiptronic the fly wheel issue is not. 1992 =
cars may present the best value, no problem cars and same as the 1993 =
and 1994 cars which carry higher prices (see five year factor above).

Conclusion:

As my daily driver the best value may be a 964 Tiptronic (only available =
as a C2). Otherwise I would select a 964 manual C2. For nostalgia =
reasons a 911 Carrera would be my third choice (unless I could get a =
really great price).
