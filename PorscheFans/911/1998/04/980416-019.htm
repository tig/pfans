Hi PFans:

This is in response to Ron's plight below. I read it and it brought painful
memories back. I did the same thing on my '87 3.2 L. I was on the last plug
and the top half came off and the threaded part of the plug stayed in. I was
in shock to say the least. I tried grabbing what little metal was left with
vise grips to see if I could turn it at all but to no avail. I had to have it
towed to my wrench and he first soaked the plug down with penetrating oil
twice and let it really soak in. After disconnecting the coil, he also turned
the engine over to get a small piece of ceramic out of the plug that was still
remaining . It shot out of the plug into the bay(lots of compression in
there). 
He then used a round metal rod that had raised edges running down the shaft. I
think it was an easy out made for that purpose. He carefully tapped the rod
into the middle of the plug(with the ceramic now out).Once the rod was safely
in the plug he took a nut and put it over the rod and carefully backed the
plug out. He said that you have to be very careful doing it because you could
mess up the inside of the plug then you'll really have a hard time getting it
out. He told me that if he wasn't able to get it out on the first try that I'd
probably be looking at pulling the motor to get better access to the plug.
Before he tapped the rod into the plug he took one of the older plugs that I
had successfully removed and machined off the top half and removed the ceramic
guts. He then did a fit check to make sure the easy out was the proper OD. 
Luck went my way and it cost me $70. 
The lesson learned for me was to soak/spray the  plugs in penetrating oil
first before trying to back them out especially if you're unsure about how
long they've been in the engine. 

Best of luck, Ernie

Well it looks like I have done it now. I was doing some routine maintenance
and everything was going well. I went to change the plug in cyl#3 and snap.
The top part of the plug broke off. This is the first time in a long time I
have had one of those sinking feelings in my stomach. I try to look at
these things positively. This is an opportunity for me to become more
mechanically involved with my car.

Does anyone have any helpful ideas?
