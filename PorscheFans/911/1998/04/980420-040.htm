Hi, Mike,

Certainly a valid point-of-view. I think lots of us are getting really
frustrated, though, having been members of many other free mailing lists
that do NOT have the problems that PorscheFans has.

It's a hard call. I too really appreciate the fact that this list is here,
and that it's provided as a free resource. I think we'd all prefer having
the list as a free resource AND a reliable resource at the same time. This
IS achievable, though I don't believe it's achievable with the current
people running the list.

Much as I value your point of view, I believe this comment is uncalled for.
You're a valued, knowledgeable contributor to the list, some of us are
not as fortunate in having your level of experience. I'd rather someone
come to the list to find out how to check their oil than damage their car.

Cheers,

Ross
