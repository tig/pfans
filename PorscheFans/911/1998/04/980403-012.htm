Good question. I currently use the Metal Master pads for the street,
and PF 80 for the track.

>1. how dirty are they? (bad for street, ok if track only)
>     The Metal Masters are acceptable (wheel slightly dirty after a few

From what I've seen, the factory pads are pretty dirty for street
or track. The MM pads are pretty clean on the street. The PF pads
are REAL dirty.

> 2. how hard are they on rotors (alway a negative in my book)
>      I don't have a valid reference for the Metal Masters.

I don't know how the stock pads are on the rotors. MM pads are VERY
easy on rotors. The PF pads are kind of tough on rotors. Not terrible
if you use them right, but still kind of tough on them.

> 3. how quickly do they come up to temp on the street?

> until I found out otherwise.)

The factory pads come up to temp quickest, followed by the MM pads.
Some people think the MM pads take too long to get warm. Personally,
I have no problem with them.

> 4. how resistant to fade are they on the track?
>      I didn't push it on the track because I didn't have the cool kit then
> and they felt like they were getting ready to fade.

Unless you're overbraking, none of those pads will fade at the track.
You might boil your brake fluid and get some fade, but I doubt you'll
get fade from the pads.

Now, if you want my opinion, I'll give it. I do not like the factory
textar or Jurid pads. Both cost too much money, and create too much dust.
I think the MM pad is a better all around pad than the factory. It
is MUCH cheaper (like $30 compared to $100 for my car), stops as well
or better, and creates much less dust. The problem with MM pads is that
they don't work well for serious track use. 

With my car, after I got sort of fast (as least I thought so), I could
wear out a set of MM pads in ONE day. The pads get too hot and basically
melt.  At that point I switched to PF 80 pads. They are just great on
the track. They work very well, and last a long time too. Unfortunately,
the PF 80 pads are NOT suitable for the street. They are a dedicated
track pad. The PF 80 needs to be HOT to stop. If you try to stop when
they are cold they are VERY abrasive to the rotor. They are also kind
of expensive, at $140 or so for the front of my car (compared to $30
for MM pads). 

So, I put the PF 80 pads in for track use, and MM pads for street use.
It takes me only about 30 minutes to change the pads (big jack, air
tools, and lots of practice).

If you're only going to do a few track events a year, I would just use
the MM pads. If you're going to do more than 10 track days a year, and
you start to get fast, you better use a different pad. I've heard that
Pagid pads work well in the street / track environment, but I've never
used them.
