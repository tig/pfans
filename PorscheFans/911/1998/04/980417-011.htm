Tory - about the rear spring plate bushings. I just did mine (79 911SC).
Getting the old ones off was a challenge but ulitmately not that bad.

Mine were more than glued on - vulcanized maybe (whatever that means).

I uses a small hand saw (made for wood) to cut as much as possible. Then a
sharp wood chisel to take it down more. Then I used a wire brush wheel on my
grinder to shine it down to bare metal. Probably could have used the wire
brush wheel for the whole thing but what a mess that would have made!

Other suggestions that I had from the list included a torch to burn it off.
I did not try this.

Worse than getting the old ones off was getting the new ones to fit. I used
Weltmiester poly bushings and they really had to be cut down to fit in the
bushing cups. Total pain in the butt!

Good luck.
