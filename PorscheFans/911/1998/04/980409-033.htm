Are your brake lines original? If so, I would replace them with new, OEM
lines. Older brake hoses can loose their strength so that when you press the
pedal the lines swell. This can give a spongy pedal feel. Stay away from
stainless brake lines unless you intend to replace them every year or two.
Stainless braided lines do wear out but you can't tell until they rupture.
Brake lines usually rupture at inopportune moments, so beware. At least with
all rubber brake lines you can tell when they are starting to wear out.

The '83 doesn't have pad thickness sensors (al least mine doesn't). The
brake warning light may be triggered by the pedal going to low, which would
certainly be the case if you pedal-bled the lines. I once read that there is
a reset switch on the MC, maybe others would know for sure.

BTW, I have had mixed experiences with Vertex. One has to remember that they
are the price low-baller and that customer service is low on their priority
list.

Subject: Locking lug nut resolution, brake warning light


I sent a message earlier this week about my mishap with the locking 
wheel lugs breaking the key, and thus rendering my attempt to fix the 
brakes useless.  Since I bought them about a month ago from Vertex, I 
called and asked the salesmen about returning them.  He told me to 
speak to a manager, who was quick to insist that I had used an impact 
wrench and that I WAS to blame for the key breaking.  I stated that I 
had used them as directed, and the key had broken, so it sounds like a 
defect to me.  He then engaged in a childish argument, trying to wear 
me down and get me to leave him alone.  I would suggest that he should 
take some responsibility for the locks breaking, and he would interrupt 
my sentence and insist "WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO????"  He had little 
regard for my input, but rather, anytime I would offer a suggestion or 
try to ask a question he would quickly reply "WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO 
(ABOUT IT)???" (Sometimes he varied it a bit.)  Anyway, my $0.02 is 
that their customer service is less than I expect, so I'll find a new 
vendor for my parts.  So, on to the resolution.  I called the dealer 
with the hopes of getting a replacement key.  He told me to call the 
manufacturer (McGard) to avoid mark-up (if you can believe it!), so I 
called and they told me to mail it in, with the code #, and they'd ship 
me a new one for free!

My question:  I recently replaced the all the brake pads, and the 
fluid.  I drove the car the yesterday to see if the brakes would grip, 
and they seemed to lock if I pushed them, which makes me doubt that the 
MC is bad, but the pedal is still pretty soft.  Also, the warning light 
is on.  What does this mean if the E-brake is off?  Low hydraulic 
pressure, sensors on the pads, poltergeist activity (to borrow from 
someone last month)???  I thought they didn't put the pad sensors on 
until 1987?  

Sorry this was so long, I just wanted to share my experience w/ Vertex 
for the benefit of others.  Thank you to those who have responded to my 
queries in the past, it's a great help.
