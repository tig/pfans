First, 

I don't know if there is a Porsche FAQ but if there is I think it
needs to have the following. When working on a Porsche 911 make
sure to have a wide array of 13mm sockets, wrenches etc.  You may
not be aware as all other cars you have previously wrenched  used
12 and 14 and 17 mm nuts. bolts. Well the Germans had to be a bit
different so the car is built with 13mm and big allen bolts. So a
must for any do it your selfer is to own a good set of 13mm
wrenches sockets etc and a nice supply of bigger then the norm
Allen wrenches..

Okay (I had those thanks:)) Now I'm pulling the front suspension
apart, everything looks nice. I have a 74 911 TARGA with a front
sway bar that does NOT go through the body. It's attached in to
places with sway bar mounts (IF the car had a frame I would say
they mount to the frame), they are held in my allen bolts. Then
they turn forward and go into a big bushing holder on the lower
A-ARM. (it's welded in place, the big reversed U bushing holder is
welded). Now the Sway bar kit that I have wants you to use a U-TAB
kit, well you can't just remove this welded bracket off the lower
A-ARM. My questions is, where is this A-ARM from? I don't see it
in any 911 specs, all either came with a U shaped bracket that has
a hole through the TABS (in order to mount the sway bar link) or
they had none thus the aftermarket U tab kits..

Anyone care to advise? The A-arm looks stock and the bracket is
welded with what looks like stock welds, very clean.  Please help.
If I haven't been clear as to my problem then feel free to email
me privately so I can try to explain better...

I'm trying to mount up my 22mm Weltmeister bar and have different
brackets on my A-Arms then what I'm suppose to have. I can bring
the arms to my friends machine shop, shave the top of the bracket
off so it's identical to the U tabs that are wanting to be used
then have them drill holes into it, matching the U tab kit. But I
don't want to have to do this if it's not necessary.


Thanks all
