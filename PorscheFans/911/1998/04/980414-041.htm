I would first check the oil cooler thermostat o-ring and the oil pressure
sender.  They are on top of the engine and can cause that exact leak.  I
thought I had an oil cooler leak, and bought new seals, but it turned out
to be the thermostat o-ring.

I never ended up touching the cooler, so I can't comment on how to
remove/fix it.
