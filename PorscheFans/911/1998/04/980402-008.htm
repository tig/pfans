First time user for a question.  I want to replace and upgrade the 
clutch on my 87 Carrera.  I have access to a roll around floor jack and 
have the Hayes manual on how to remove the engine/transmission.  I don't

have a hoist, so the question is how do I jack the car up high enough to

remove the engine/transmission?  Do you use ramps,jack stands, both, or 
some other way.  The manual said it, "easy" once you get the back end up

high enough.


Bill:
First jack up the car with your floor jack by jacking under the
engine...at about the point in front of the oil drain.  Then put your
jack stands under the torsion bar (?) tubes at the wheel wells.  Release
the engine/tranny from the car and lower it to the garage floor with
your jack.  Then put the jack under the car at the fire wall point in
front of the tranny.  You will see a seam there which is pretty strong.
Use a piece of 2x6 or 2x8 to spread the load.  Jack the car up farther
until the engine can be slid out from under the car.
What did I leave out?  You need another floor jack or an engine dolly to
use to wheel the engine tranny around.  You can build a simple engine
dolly out of 2x4's with casters on them.  Make it in a u shape that will
accommodate your jack.  Quite simple.  I did this and was able to move
everything around by myself.   Another hand does not hurt though.
If you want more detail on the dolly, let me know.
  Good luck
