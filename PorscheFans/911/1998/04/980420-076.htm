The FIRST day I bought my black '88 911 coupe my wife opened the passenger
door into the corner of the back bumper on her car.  There were absolutely
no other dents or dings elswhere on the car.  I called my local "Dent
Wizard" who came to my house and worked the ding out from behind.  He did a
great job, and you can't tell anything ever happened.
