The speedo is electrical, so it sounds like a bad connection. There is a
sending unit on the transmission that is subject to some pretty harsh
conditions. I suppose that checking it out on a lift (or jackstands) would
be one place to start.

Good Luck!

I got an 88 Venetian Blue 911 Coupe in October and love it but have never
posted anything before...My speedometer stopped today, as well as the
odometer for about 10 minutes, then turned back on.  Any ideas on what to
do?  BTW, I find this list incredibly informative, and have even met a few
neat, very helpful people who were very willing to give of their time and
information.  This is not what I expected when I first got my car.  I am
truly amazed!
