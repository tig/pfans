Hi all, based on the positive experience of another p-fans member I bought a
complete set of 70 watt light blue bulbs for my '97 993. I've used them
about three times now and strictly from my own practical perspective I don't
like them. Even though they are rated at 70w they seem much darker to me
than standard 55w white bulbs. Maybe it just takes time to adapt to this
color because we're all so conditioned to white headlights (at least in the
U.S.). I have to believe the real Porsche Litronic and similarly the MB
Xenon are superior to standard lighting, at least they should be given their
cost. 

I have four H1s and two H3s (fog lights). I paid about $90 for the six bulbs
and would happily sell the set for half price. I've decided to replace these
with a set of PIAA replacement bulbs, the ones that supposedly draw and burn
as cool as a 55w but illuminate at 100w. I've been very happy with the PIAA
replacement bulbs and crystal ion fog lamps on my truck.

Thanks - Mike Solomon
