Over this past weekend I finally discovered that a leaky oil pressure
switch was the cause of the oil dripping down the right rear (towards
front of car) of the motor.  To get this R&R'd, I removed everything
"north" of the throttle body.  With all this removed you can kinda stick
your head in there and see the sender which has a red cap and a single
green wire attached to it.  Note - it's not the sealing washer which
leaks, but the actually sender switch itself (the internals of mine
could move within the metal casing).  A 24mm *deep* socket is required
for removal - plenty of room to swing a breaker bar once you add in an
extension.

The switch (it's called a switch because it's just a yes/no device) is
all of $8 from the local dealer.  E-mail me at bjanesi@juno.com if you
need the part#.

Thanks to all who suggested this was the suspect - thankfully it wasn't
the main seal, oil cooler, etc...
