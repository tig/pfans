I have been reading and contributing to this list for quite a while now
and I am concerned with the recent incidents of name calling and
personal attacks which have recently appeared.  This list has been a
great source of information and, yes, friendship (in an ethereal way)
which I would not want to see degenerate into a forum for flaming and
other boorish behavior.  Worse yet, decent and helpful people like Steve
might just pack it in  and leave this place (metaphysically speaking)
with the rest of us a little poorer as a consequence.
So...if you are inclined to blast someone, go get another cup of
whatever, think about it, write it down but don't send it...and then
forget about it.

Lets stick to the cars and issues in which we are all interested.

By the way...on the valve clicking/clatter issue which I raised some
time ago, if the valves are adjusted properly they do not make any
clicking or tappet like noises.  Bruce is right (as usual).
