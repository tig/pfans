Here's a post I wrote about 2 years ago when I installed mine (removing
the
gas tank is easy and makes installation a lot easier).

'74 911/3.0

I just finished up installing adjustable 22mm Weltmeister sway-bars F/R
on my 
'74 911 and thought I'd share a few tips I learned along the way to make
this 
less painful for anyone else DIY in the future. 

1. The rears are a snap, just swapping in and out.  If you have an
earlier 
'74-'77 911, make sure you get the smaller plastic bushings.  I didn't
and 
spent another $25 at Automotion for 2 bushings and waited a week.  A 6mm
Allen
socket eases screwing in the long bolt mounted to the eccentric on the
spring plate.  I made
my own from a cut-off piece of 6mm Allen key and 6 mm socket from a
previous project.  

2. The front swaybar on '74+ cars is a bit more involved since you're 
replacing the old A-arm mounted bar with an earlier-style
through-the-body bar
and the old brackets must be removed and the new bar mounted behind the
gas 
tank.   2 triangular reinforcing plates are bolted to the inner fender
behind 
the strut and the sway bar goes through the center of the plates.  I
quickly 
came to the conclusion that I could not get my hands behind the gas tank
so I 
removed the tank!  This is a lot easier than it sounds in a 911.
(Siphon gas 
out, loosen 2 fuel hoses under tank, unplug fuel level sender on top of
tank, 
loosen vent hose and filler hose, remove 3 Allen brackets and lift out. 
It 
can be done in 15 minutes.)  There is an embossed raised template on the
inner
fender well where the factory conveniently marked the area for the
plates and 
the sway bar opening. The rear of the triangular plate should be
oriented 10 
degrees from vertical so it helps a lot if you scribe a vertical line on
the 
inner fender well before getting the front way up in the air.  3 holes
are drilled for 
the plate but 1 hole is right behind the strut so either tilt the strut
out or
do as I did and drill from inside since the tank was out.  Drill a large
1" 
hole for the bar itself.  I found a 1" drill bit at Sears for a 1/2"
drill.  
Holes need to be perfect the first time else this area will look like
swiss 
cheese.   Don't forget to paint the drilled area to prevent the rust
demon.

Next is cutting off the old brackets: this is a major PITA.  I used an
air 
cut-off wheel and a reciprocating saw to follow the weld bead and a cold

chisel when I got frustrated.  Be careful not to cut into the arm.
After 
grinding the weld down, a 7/16" hole needs to be drilled into the arm
for the 
new U-tab bracket.  The swaybar is then installed with the drop-links to
the 
the U-tab. Don't forget to lube the plastic bushing on the sway-bar.
The drop
links need to be adjusted to remove any pre-load after reassembly.  My 
starting position for the bars was half-way on the front and about 1"
less 
than half-way (stiff) on the rear.  After my first run at Sunday's autox
at 
Monclair, NJ, the car oversteered so I moved the rears out (loose) about
1".
