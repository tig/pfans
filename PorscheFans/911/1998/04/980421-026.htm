I'm resending this since I believe it did not make it to the list:

Ok,

It's been a while since I was humbled either by my car or by
the list so I suppose I was due:

Earlier I wrote:

It has been pointed out to me that this is only a brake system light,
not a brake/oil light.  Why did I think so?  Well, it's on the guage
which has oil temp and pressure on it and the light itself has "oil"
written under it.  OTOH, the discerning German symbol interpreter will
note that between "oil" and the light there is a symbol which
to some people might imply parking brake but to me looks like
a hairpin.  Or a thermometer with mercury rising.  Or something.

So upon reflection and RTFM it appears that "oil" is referring to the guage
and not the light.

Anyway, it looks like my master cylinder switch is out and either
needs to be fixed or reset.

Thanks,
