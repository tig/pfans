P-Fans:

I was once told (or maybe I read it) that Euro cars have lower sales
prices because Europeans drive them harder and take less care of them.
I really do not think it is true.  Maybe, when a lot of P-Cars were
imported to the U.S. in the eighties someone must have gotten a raw deal
and started this interesting bit of information.  Or perhaps it is
because they can go off on the autobahn and do 150 no worries and we
Americans are jealous?  Personally, I like the fact that I had to pay
less for more horses *grin*  Now if only I could pay less for parts.....

-Michael
