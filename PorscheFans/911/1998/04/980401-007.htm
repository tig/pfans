About a year ago I purchased a B&B/TriFlow muffler/headers type package
from Powerhaus in Phoenix.  Before I purchased them I had many long
debated with my conscious over if the setup would be too loud, not sound
right, wake up the neighbors when I go to work out in the morning, come
home late at night, or just plain not notice a big difference.  I wish I
could have HEARD this system before purchase.

After installing and running for one year I am positive I made the right
choice.  Lovely sound.  When you are at full throttle you can hear it
and it sounds great.   Late at night, on the residential streets just do
a little short shifting, (a responsible individual couldn't drive around
neighborhoods in even first gear at the red-line.)  The real fun if
pulling into a parking garage or a tunnel and bliping the throttle! I
digress...sorry.

If you would like to hear this lovely sound, I have made many recordings
with a portable DAT (Digital Audio Tape) machine.  I would be happy to
e-mail these sounds to you.

- 0-100 mph
- 35-95 mph
- Starting car in home garage
- Starting car in Big empty parking garage (This one may scare off
people concerned about noise.  Please remember the garage adds about 3
seconds of reverb and the walls reflecta lot of sound back to the mic.)
-I would also be happy to record and custom sounds (within reason) you
would like.  It gives me an excuse to play!

If you are interested e-mail me at J&PKRECEK@TCONL.COM
I will be happy to send.

Sounds can be sent in resolution from 8 bit mono to 16 bit stereo (cd
quality).

Usual disclaimers apply.  Just happy to play.
