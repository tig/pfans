I have an '89 911 (factory widebody) with the dunlop d40 m2's, and I drive
this car everywhere, over 20k miles a year - this is my third set of these
tires,
and what I've noticed is that after 12k miles, the tires *vibrate* - the
best 
way to describe it is a three second vibration, then five seconds of
smooth,
over and over at highway speeds (80-90mph).  finally it gets annoying
enough,
that I replace them - the rears are the worst - they get the *center worn
groove*
about this same time, so out they go, and the tire rack sells me two more
for
a little over $100 bucks each- I can't buy tires for my CJ-5 that cheap!!!

Yesterday, I ordered a full set of the bridgestone SO-2's (for lots more
money
than the d40's!) I thought I'd give them a try...

Perhaps my wheels are not true, but they look undamaged, and un-scratched
for that matter...

FWIW, I had a toyota MR-2 that had great looking front tires, which I
balanced
serveral times to no avail - finally I replaced them, and boom, vibration
and 
wandering gone!

(three years ago when I got it, had 45k miles; now has 104, and no, I
missed the
100@100kmiles trick (don't know the history of this anyway...))
