Garey,
It's the widely held opinion of Porsche nuts (mine included), that
additives such as Prolong are not necessary for your car, and can even
be damaging.  If anyone ever tries to sell you a "miracle" in a bottle
take heed that it is merely "snakeoil."  If you'll read your owners
maual I do believe that Porsche even specifically recommends not using
any oil additives in their cars.  And as far as 92 vs 93 octane, there
really isn't much of a difference, but if you have Shell, Amoco or
Phillips 66 gas stations in your area you should be able to find 93
octane fuel.  Always use the highest octane that you have available!
