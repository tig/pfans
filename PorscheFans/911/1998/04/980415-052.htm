Why twinn-plug?

Because you can run, say 11.3:1 on pump gas, whcih is not possible
otherwise without severly retarded timing.  My 3.4 makes a bunch of
power (over 180 hp I'm sure), runs about 11:1, spins to about 7800 and
only needs pump gas.  Without twinn plugging, the flame front would
have to travel considerabl y farther for complete combusition,
requiring more timing advance, increasing probability of detonation,
whcih is really an unhappy thing with pistons travelling at those rates
of speed.

That little "ping" you hear is the flame front advancing down the
combustion chamber (wel..over actually, in a 911) and smacking Mr.
Piston in the face while he's trying to get up to TDC.

Can lead to unwanted ventalation and is thought by many to cause the
rod bearing failure known to happen on 944turbos.

Octane is a rating of how much pressure/heat a combustable can stand
before it fires all by itself...like a deisel engine.  When you run more compression and advance the additional residual heat is enough to ignite the mixtiure prematurely and 
bad things (see above) happen.

Consider th efairly marginal HP gains the 3.6 got over the 3.2 ltr.  These
were a result of increased compression (11.3:1 vs 9.8:1 max) made possible by the 
twinn plug ignition, and by the 12% increase in displacement.

RE Twinn Plug...

Actually it's close zero HP and is only necessary with 
additional compression.  Lets you run less advance at same power with 
less chance of detonation at higher compression.....

I speak from experience - I did the compression bump and the
twinn plug.

Here are the costs:

Electromotive unit $850
Head Mod $450 -w- shipping
Plugs $12
Wires $100 (all 12 need to be replaced)
Tioming gear/plug $250

Plus assembly.
