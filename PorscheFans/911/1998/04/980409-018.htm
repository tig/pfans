	Dear Andrew:
		I have produced on a custom basis mufflers with dual inlet/dual outlet
with  4" rolled edge tips that hook up the B&B headers for C2/C4 1989-1994
3.6 cars. The system is 100% T 304SS- the muffler has a lifetime warranty
vs. 2 years for the competition.
	 I am currently engineering and fabricating the same type header muffler
Porsche system for all SSI equiped, European headers, and B&B triflo header
equiped: 3.0SC and 3.2 Carrera equiped vehicles from 1978-1989.
	I am approximately 30-60 days from offering the systems for sale. I am
doing this as I have been getting alot of pressure from independent Porsche
shops, race teams, and Porsche dealers to make and sell a higher flow
higher quality/ lifetime warranty 304SS muffler for the cars
aforementioned.
	 I am just waiting for a 3.2l Carrera owner with SSIs type headers but
with larger primaries to get over to us ASAP.  BUT I  also need a 3.2l
Carrera with Carrera owner with B&B headers to call me for great deal on a
nonresonating hiperformance header muffler for their car to round out this
product line.  
	The header muffler system fits great and is quieter than certain brands
but  flows better than other header muffler systems tested but is
nonresonating and sounds throaty and burbly. I am going to have a special
offer to P car owners to get the systems out in the Porsche world so that
everyone sees that there is a better alternative and build word of mouth-
thats how confident I am of my header back system. 
	Lastly, I will be offering a Dyno matched chip  with Ignition and Fuel
curves tailored to the better breathing of a header or no cat converter
equiped Porsche. Without the proper chip we have seen a 3.2 Carrera with
B&B header muffler system make 3 more HP than a stock 3.2 carrera with no
cat and stock chip. The B&B header equiped car responded well on the DYNO
with +10 hp after mapping the proper fuel curve thereby replacing the lean
"namebrand" aftermarket performance chip based and derived on and intended
for a stock 3.2 Carrera. Fabspeed has no plans to make headers- the other
companies make very nice products. We definitely can help you with a better
performing and sounding muffler and the only Dyno developed, tuned and
matched chip. Dual inlet dual 4" outlet $975 Chip $350
