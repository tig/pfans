I would ask Steve Weiner (porsche@rennsportsystems.com) to get you set up. 
The Racers Group offers a kit using the Earles cooler, which I installed
in my IROC clone, however later research showed that I might have gotten a 
bit better system elsewhere. Steve has been -very- helpfull with tech advice
and parts, and is a regular contributor here. Support those who support us!
