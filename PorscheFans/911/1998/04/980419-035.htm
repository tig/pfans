Pfans,
	This is my first attempt at posting to this forum.  I hope I don't
screw it up to badly.  I used the "red" Loctite 518 on my 3.2 engine cam
casings and everywhere else I needed a gasket dressing or seal.  I used
it because I waited too long to order the Orange stuff (574) and the
local Napa dealer had the red.  It was only 12 dollars for the tube that
costs over twice as much from Automotion.  I looked at the specs for
both sealants at http://www.loctite.com/tds   The Orange stuff looks
better for high temps and resistance to solvents (Gas and Oil).  I used
the Red stuff anyway and it has sealed fine.  There is a Acetone primer
that should be used with either sealant to ensure a good seal.
	I also had a bad experience with Vertex.  They sent me an off brand
rotor and tried to tell me it was a genuine Bosche part.  They did
replace it when I called them on it but I don't think it was an
accident.  
	I had my 3.2 out because it had developed leakage between the cylinders
and heads on 2 cylinders.  I have since hear of other 3.2s with this
problem.  I had known about 3.6 engine problems with these leaks but now
I know it can occationally happen on 3.2s.  If anyone has questions or
comments about 3.2 cylinder head leaks and my repair for it please
e-mail me directly.
	The project was my first for a Porsche and was much easier than I
expected thanks to Bruce Andersons book and even the dreaded Haynes
manual.
