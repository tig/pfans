My '90 C2 doesn't leak... and has not had the updated parts installed.

The story I've heard is that VERY few cars actually had the leak problem. It's
a bonus if you can find one that has had the fix, but I wouldn't turn down
a perfectly good car because the fix isn't there (assuming it's not leaking!)

There was no recall - leaking cars were fixed under warranty IF the leaks
were wet to the touch (i.e. if they showed signs of having leaked in the past
but were dry now, they were not fixed). The 2nd dealer (saying that ALL 911s
leak) is full of it. It's a tougher engine to seal than some, but NOT all
911s leak. I have testimony of that sitting in my garage ;^)

FYI, I started looking for an '87-'89 coupe as well, and after 8 months
of not finding what I wanted, my car came available... I drove it and
was hooked...

Try both before you decide, and don't let rumours of a widespread leaking
problem stop you...

There are a couple of other things that you need to watch out for on an
early C2, though - the flywheel (IF original, and that's unlikely!) did
fail before it's time on ALL of these cars. Unless you are looking at a
very low-mileage car, it's likely that it has been replaced with uprated
parts. Check service records to be sure - the new flywheel is called
the LUK flywheel (LUK is the company making the flywheel).

Also, there should be a distributor vent kit installed - this vents any
potential ozone buildup in the distributor, which was known to eat away
at the belt driving the 2nd distributor. The vent kit is very inexpensive
and is an easy do-it-yourself installation, but if the car is high mileage
without the kit, it might be prudent to have the distributor removed and
the existing belt replaced in case it has deteriorated. This is probably
a $200 to $300 operation in total. Sending a distributor in to have the
belt replaced will cost something like $150.

In the end, I'm glad I stepped up to a C2 - I love it!!!!!

Cheers,

Ross
