While a burned out alternator light bulb is certainly the cheapest and
easiest to test and fix cause of the bulb not lighting up as it should when
the ignition is turned on before starting the car, I think the next most likely
problem is a failed regulator.  This may be particularly true on the newer
(post 2.7) cars with the regulator mounted in the alternator, where it gets
hotter than in the older side-of-the-engine-bay external mount position,
but I have no statistics for this WAG.

So if the bulb is good (one wire coming to the bulb socket should have 12
volts or so on it when the ignition is turned on.  Grounding the other wire
should make the bulb turn on), I'd replace the regulator.  Or, since you
have to do almost if not all of the work needed to remove the whole fan
housing with the alternator in it in order to replace the regulator if it is
mounted on the alternator, take the whole kit and kaboodle out and take it
to an auto electric shop (prefereably one which says they can work on
Porsche alternators, although there is no special magic here - they just
need a stock of regulators and parts) and they can tell you if the
alternator is shot as well.  

When I had a regulator go out, it was announced by the lack of the
warning light (which I missed seeing) followed by dead battery when the
charge ran out (hard to miss that).  When I had an alternator start going
bad, it was announced by other symptoms (warning light wouldn't go
out, at least not regularly when it should).  That alternator had worn the
slip rings where the brushes contact almost entirely through.  So far I
have escaped the dreaded "blown diodes," so I don't know just how the
idiot light reacts when that happens.

The old mechanical regulators  sometimes will stop regulating very well
when contacts wear or corrode or springs weaken, so the alternator
puts out too much voltage, which results in boiling the water in the
battery (and instead of just venting nice distilled water out the battery,
you find white acidic encrustations on the outside of the vents, and
down on your metal bodywork busilly rusting it).

Let's hope it is just a bad bulb.  If it is, though, after replacing it I'd check
the voltage when the engine is running, just to see if you are putting out
too much and that caused the bulb to go bad.  Those bulbs don't get all
that much use and can last an awfully long time.  

Then again, there is a lot of random variance in some mass produced
parts, I suppose.  Like Ron whose spark plug broke in half.  How the hell
did that happen?
