| When starting off for work this morning my alternator light stayed lit for
| about one-quarter mile, then went out.  Upon arriving to work (about 40
| miles) things seemed normal, except the alternator light didn't "blink"
| like it usually does when turning off the ignition.  I also noticed the
| driver's side headlamp bulb (that I replaced about 3 months ago) was not
| operating.  Eight hours later the car started right up, although the
| alternator light did not come on at all when turning the key to start the
| car.  I quickly noticed that my turn indicators and upshift light on the
| tachometer were much dimmer than usual.  Upon arriving home I tried to
| restart the car, and the starter motor would barely turn.
| 
| I figured I'd try a new battery (the current one shows a discharge
| condition in its window), and hope that's the extent of my problem.  My
| question is, does the above sound like just an old, worn out battery or
| possibly an alternator/regulator problem.  The car has about 100K, and as
| far as I know still the original alternator.  Any help appreciated!

Funny you should ask about this.  I had an '87 car just checked out in a 
pre-purchase mechanical inspection and it had this problem.  My mechanic 
told the owner to get it fixed before they get stranded.  He said the 
alternator was gone and not charging the battery.  This was indicated
by the alternator light not going on as you turn the key.

PS. if anyone knows of a '87-89 coupe for sale in the San Jose, Bay Area.  I'm
interested in a car in great condition.  So far I've had 3 cars checked out
that haven't worked out.  Also we don't like Red or Black.  Thanks,
.
