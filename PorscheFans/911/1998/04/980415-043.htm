Hi all...

Dave Darling of the 914 list had an interesting theory regarding the
# of subscribers to the PFans lists...

It could be that what we're now seeing when we post is the number
of people subscribed in message-at-a-time mode - the list still seems
reasonably active despite receiving reports that there's only 160
people still subscribed, and most of the respondants to my "spam" message
say that they're still ok... Hmmm...

I'll further Dave's theory by suggesting that the PFans list software might
have been upgraded last week during the day of inactivity. If that's
the case, it sure would have been nice if we'd been informed that this
would be happening!!! I know we receive this as a free service and that's
great, but there's THOUSANDS of other mailing lists out there that are
also free services that run with no problems AND with decent administration.

I'm frustrated yet again with the management of the PFans lists. I'd like
to try to gauge the interest here for taking control and moving these lists
(and hopefully the web site as well) to a better-managed facility running
better list-management software. For those that haven't been on PFans for
long, we have been having the following recurring problems:

 - list subscription information mysteriously disappearing
 - "repeat" messages (used to be very very severe - to the point where many
   subscribers quit in disgust)
 - non-existant administration presence

for AT LEAST the last 1.5 years.

Can you please respond to me at: parker@bctm.com with a yes/no - yes if you
think we should try to move the lists and no if you feel they should stay
where they are? This is just an information-gathering exercise - I'll report
yes/no numbers back to the list in the next few days. The logistics of HOW
to move the lists would of course be the next hurdle, but let's worry about
that if/when we get there.

Thanks!

Ross
