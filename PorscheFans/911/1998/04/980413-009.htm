Here's a common mistake ( I think ) ... I washed my 1996 993 C2 and popped
both the trunk and engine lids to clean inside. I got distracted for a few
minites and came back to finish the job. I pulled it into the garage for a few
rainy days and when I went to start it up ... dead battery. I forgot to close
the engine lid completely. 
    Thats when I found that the engine and trunk lights come on as soon as you
pop the latch ... the latch is the switch !!
Next question .... what is the best way to recharge the battery ... i've heard
several versions . The manual says to remove the  battery connections and
recharge. (pain in the rear) . The dealer says to leave the connections on and
recharge using a 10 amp charger or less .... and remember to manually close
the latch with the hood open.

Another point .... if the battery is completely dead ... the immobilizer might
not respond to the keyless entry. Once you connect the charger .... keep
trying to arm/unarm the system so you won't have to manually do it (a royal
pain in the rear)
