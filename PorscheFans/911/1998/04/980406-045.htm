<<I would like to know if there is a good way to protect the exaust
componentes from rusting and corrosion. The rust and corrosion seems to
be at the point where the exchanger and exaust ports attach. The muffler
seems to be fine because it is SS, however the heat exchangers and cat  
are not. I am not to concerned with the cat because it can be easly
removed and replaced, but I don't think the exchangers would be all that
easy.  I live in a fairly wet climate and I am concerned about rust. Is
there a coating or treatment that can be done to the heat exchangers or
for that matter any off the exaust.  Any advice is appriciated!>>

Donald,
You may want to look into applying a ceramic coating to your heat exchangers.
After blasting to bare metal, they coat both the inside and outside of your
exhaust system. The companies claim corrosion protection and reduced heat
radiation. Here are some websites you can try.

JetHot Coatings (URL unknown, but easy enough to find)

I powder coated my heat exchangers some years ago and, although in storage
until recently, they seem to be holding up fine (at least for the 300 miles
the car's been running anyway).
