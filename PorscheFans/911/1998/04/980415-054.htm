For Tory Blue,
The Riverside Region, PCA, has a wholesale account with Walter's
Mercedes-Benz/
Porsche in Riverside.  This was initiated by their Service Manage, who
said that he was concerned that so few club members used the dealership
for service or parts.  A very nice gesture on his part, and a
substantial savings to members who want to take advantage.

I'd rather go to my favorite wrench (Don Kravig, Precision Motion,
Riverside, CA) and pay him full price for parts.  He is always very
helpful with free advice, tips on parts installation learned from many
years in the business, all-around nice guy, former Region President and
current club member.  The dealer parts guys are nice enough, but don't
know much about the cars.  My 2 pfennigs worth.
