The C4 DOES get more traction because it uses four wheels to accelerate
which allows you to put the power on much earlier in corners.  As far as
the understeer, the factory did dial in a lot of understeer on all 964's
which can easily be removed by adjusting tire pressure, bars and spring
rates.  My 964 has NO trouble pitching its tail out and is basically stock.

Mostly for the same reasons the 993 C2 is better than the 964 C2.  The 993
has a simpler AWD system that was considered too slow for the 964.  The
964's is actually the better system, but more expensive.  With the 964
Porsche was trying to prove that 911's can be configured not to oversteer,
by tuning for understeer.  With the 993 they set the suspension for neutral
handling and didn't need the benefits of the faster 964 AWD system.

Pretty strong statement, I would take a Yugo if someone would give it to
me.  Do you really believe that the 964 C4 is that bad a car considering
about 85% of the parts are the same as the 993's you think so highly of?

Check Road and Track.  The '89 C4 is rated to 60 at 4.9, the C2 at 5.2 I
believe and 993's are currently rated about 5.6?.  I don't care much for
0-60 times as they very GREATLY, but AWD always wins off the line, the
lower weight helps once the tires hook up.  RWD cars spin the tires and hop
whereas AWD cars are limited by the clutches and the willingness to destroy
the car.

But, as was said, the engine, transmission and suspension are all the same
on both cars, so unless you are near the limit, the cars are basically the
same.  A full tank of gas or a passenger will offset the weight difference
and the AWD only activates with wheels are slipping which is rare for a 911
on the street.

Of all the systems in the 964, the AWD is one of the more reliable but can
be expensive to repair.  But what isn't very expensive to repair on these
cars?

If $20,000 more is no big deal to you, then get the 993.  But $20k will pay
for a lot of AWD repairs, in my opinion.  I still say, the cars are
virtually identical in most non-track dry road driving situations, so find
a clean, well maintained, low mileage C2 or C4 at the right price and you
will end up with a wonderful car.  And I never drive my C4 in the snow, of
course I live in San Diego and have an Audi Quattro that uses the 993 AWD
system (actually Porsche uses Audi's system) as my ski car.

Also, to put this in performance perspective, my stock '83 944 beat sever
993's at the autocross yesterday.  Not to say I am a great driver, but a
little driving skill is a lot more important that any differences in 911
models.

Just my $.02
