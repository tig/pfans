An addition to Tim Wolfe suggestions:
I replaced recently all the bushings with poly bushings on my 82 930.
For the rear ones, I used a metal saw to cut as much as possible. Then,
I used a paint remover device (don't know the name in English, but it is
basically a high temperature "hair dryer" with a chisel blade attached
to it, that you find in any hardware store for about 30 $). Then you
just strip off the reminder. Time consuming but easy. Then finish with
fine sand paper.
For the front ones YOU DO NOT NEED to remove front A-Arm, disconnect
strut bottom attachment (real easy...)  or tie rods like it is often
suggested. Just remove front arm attachment, extract torsion bar, slide
out one end at a time of sway bar then slide A-arm out toward front and
let it rest on a block of wood. Then use a 3 claws extractor. To
reinsert sway bar jack up suspension a little bit (migh require 2 or 3
attempts).
A special addition to Automotion advertisement to any body who wants to
install:
1-Polygraphite bushings: Each one needs 30-45 mn of extra careful size
adjustment through extensive sanding (both inside and out) . Extra
precise clearance (1/10 mm) for the inside is required. For the outside
my preference goes to a slightly oversized sizing which requires a
rubber hammer to insert the bushing in the cup ( about 6-700 pounds
pressure which still allows to remove it with an extractor for eventual
future replacement). A total pain but it really makes a difference on
track.
2-Engine solid mounts (set of four): You get four engine mounts, which
means that you need to recut precisely the gearbox mounts. An electric
metal saw and a lot of grinding will get them down to size. Total
unadvertised pain. If you like to keep your car relatively silent and
still benefit from precise shifting, only install two on the gearbox
attachments and leave the engine mounts alone. It will not strain
engine-gearbox structure.
