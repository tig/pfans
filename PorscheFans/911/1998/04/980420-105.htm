<<I have a Targa which exhibits excessive wind noise from the front of the
Targa roof (even at low speeds). 

I have noticed the metallic clips have worn and I believe that the roof is
not 'clipping' into 
them properly. This is probably the cause of the noise - I think.

Question is, how can the problem be alleviated (replacing the roof is my
last choice)?>>

I had the same problem with my 77.  What I did (after much frustration and
thinking I'm either going to fix it or break it) was to set the targa top up
so the back edge was on the floor and then placed a plastic handle of a
screwdriver side ways  on top of one of the two  center hold down clips.
Using a medium size  hamer, I  struck the plastic handle with more than a
light tap.  After noticing that the clips moved, I proceeded to tap them down
untill they made a good contact woith the top lip,  

This was repeated on the other middle clip and wala I have a quiet top again.
This may work for your problem as well.  My clips were worn but also the top
sections with respect to the targa top frame were too far forward.  This
alowed them to slip off the frame lip.  

The back clips now are a little loose and rattle a bit but I no longer have
the air leaks in the front.  

Hope this helps.
