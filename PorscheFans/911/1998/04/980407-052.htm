Peter,

It would seem odd to me that a balance problem with your tires would
cause vibration SOMETIMES but no vibration other times. Similarly, if the
tires are out-of-round or have some other flaw, I would think the vibration
would always be there (speed-dependent, of course).

Have you checked all the other obvious items? Steering, wheel bearings,
etc etc?

Did the vibration start as soon as the D40s were mounted on the car, and
was there never vibration before?

Cheers,

Ross
