>1) He replaces the switch on the front oil cooler fan with one that
will
activate it at 210 degrees rather than the stock 250; 

I've done this on my ex- VW Corrado VR6. Worked as advertised !  ;-) 
I don't see why it wouldn't work for your porsche !

2) He recommends changing from conventional oil to synthetic as it will
cool things down and protect better

Protect better, yeah, cool things down ?  I don't see why synthetic
would cool things down, but it withstands higher temps better, so it
might be a good idea, but like the man said the switch might reveal a
leak here and there (we've been into this debate before, all I'll say is
2 of my previous cars started leaking when I switched. Synthetic does
not cause leaks, it reveals them !)

>3) The car has what was aptly described here in the past as the "Motel
6
bedspring" syndrome - [...] worth a try ?

Yes ! I did that myself 3 weeks ago on the recommendation of Terry, on
the list. Worked fine. The bushings on the A arm are not removable from
the arms, so yeah, either you replace the whole thing or you live with
the squeak. What I did was remove the center bushings, lube those, and
that gave the torsion bar enough play to squeeze in some grease in the A
arm bushings. They still squeaked when I was trying to lube them, but
once everything was bolted back on, the car was silent !  You may try
this yourself, it's not very difficult to do !  ;-)
