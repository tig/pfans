Mr. rww696,

Removal of this strip is via the "yank it completely off" method.  You may
be able
to fix the part that has come loose, but I doubt it.

To replace this, you have to start at one end and slide the entire piece of
rubber onto the rocker (after the rocker is screwed to the car) at one
time.  Some
sort of lubrication is an absolute (I used ArmorAll believe it or not - it's not
good for much of anything else, but it helps when replacing that rubber strip).

The "end caps" that attach at each end of the rockers are steel (aluminum?),
not plastic.  I've got some of these left over from my '76 if you'd like them.

Good luck,
