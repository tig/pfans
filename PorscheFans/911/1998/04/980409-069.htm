I had read an article on a H20 injection system for supercharged/turbo
cars.. the system actually fed a mist of water into the intake of the
engine.. the air was cooled more effeciently with it having a "humidity" to
it.. more cooled air gave the mixture a more dense pack and more power....
it seemed good in the concept... the dyno showed a hp jump of about 10hp...
not sure if the system would work as well on a normally aspirated car, or
if the intercooler had a big effect on the humid air.
