Without taking the valve covers off, the only way to tell is audibly. It
sounds like ticking that changes rate with RPMs. If you take the valve
covers off you can feel the valve stems move side-to-side in the guides. If
they move you've got wear.

Subject: Signs of '87 Carrera valve guide wear?


Dear Fellow Porsche Fans: 

How do I watch for valve guide wear on my '87 Carrera? 

I've been reading a lot recently about how '87-'89 Carreras apparently
develop
early valve guide wear problems -- some with only 30K or 50K miles!  Now I'm
worried that my 68,000 mile '87 coupe is destined for the same fate. 

Although my car feels like a champion (it cold starts immediately, idles
nicely, runs strong and has no oil leaks) there IS one tiny, little thing
that
worries me: when the engine is completely warm, and I blip the throttle (as
in
heel-and-toeing a downshift) I can hear from time-to-time, a small, muted
'pop' (kind of a backfire I guess). The engine never misses under load.
Although the timing seems to be spot-on and the plugs are clean and tan, I
will have the car fine-tuned soon, looking for any ignition-based tuning
problems.

I almost wish I hadn't learned about this problem -- it's taking some of the
joy out of driving my "baby." Am I unnecessarily worried? Is there anything
other than the obvious (Castrol oil, Chevron 91 octane, etc.) I can do to
prevent it? What signs do I look for? 

Thanks in advance!
