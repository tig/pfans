Hi Doug:
	Great idea- Fabspeed is in and will provide a single 4" outlet
 100%T304SS catback exhaust for the comparison. To make everything fair and
in the quest to have the most reliable bolt-on performance you should test
chips as well. Fabspeed will provide you with a Matching DME chip Dyno
developed and tuned for the car with or without the catalytic converter. 
To make it fair:
	1. Make sure all competitors send a single outlet muffler.
	2. 3rd gear accleration tests are the way to test performance improvement.
	  1st or 2nd gears means you be reaching for the shifter in split seconds.
Or 	   use a chassis dyno.Fabspeed tests and continually restests on the
dyno 	    simpler and safer. I  once got a huge ticket on the Penna.
Turnpike in a 		993TT.
	3.Radio Shack sells a nice $70 DB meter. Race tracks use them as well as 	
  Fabspeed. It however, does not measure resonance and droanning.
	4. Warranty periods- Fabspeed is lifetime- with a 16Guage muffler vs 22 	 
 	   guage paper thin stuff. Lifetime versus as little as 2 years.
	5. Weight savings while still having a mellow sportscar sound. Fabspeed 
saves 42lbs while being catback emissions legal. 2 bypasses like the 
Carrera Cup cars as you suggested would be too loud but even lighter.
	5. Video tape- tape your results. Fabspeed has just videotaped 993s with
bone stock and several catback exhaust systems and different chip combos.
This is great stuff! Its too much for internet bandwidth as download time
would be too long. The video makes for  great performance chronicles. With
Fabspeed exhaust changes only, no chips allowed in PCA Club stock classes,
you quickly realize why Fabspeed exhaust equiped 993s virtually won every
race entered in 1997 and were 1, 2 at Sebring in 1998.
