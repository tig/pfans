We have to distinguish between road and track driving. In road driving a
neutral behavior could be more acceptable than a oversteering car, but we
have to say that 911 (in particular post sixties cars, not to say 964 and
993) express their tendency to oversteer just in case of horrible and
unforgivable mistakes or in a very spiritate driving behavior.
The big size difference  between rear and front and the accurate 911
suspension tune up, make the legendary oversteering danger nothing more then
an urban legend in open road driving. Obviously a little skill is needed to
drive 300 and plus hp cars, oversteering or understeering.
In track driving oversteering becomes an useful feature; as in the most
advanced fighter planes, if you want an extremely handly car, as required in
competitions, you need a less then stable behavior, that let you able to
modify in a quicker way direction, cornering etc. When 911 was introduced in
rally competitions, her controlled oversteering became a formidable weapon
for fast cornering; the same for track competitions, were very skilled
drivers were able to decide the best cornering and passing lines. A 911 at
high speed and  racing tuned up is, in a way, very similar to an F16,
relying on the driver (flying-by-wire for F16) skill more then on built-in
stability.
