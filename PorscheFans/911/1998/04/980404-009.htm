"Important rule #1:
remove the filler plug first. If you first remove the drain plug and then
discover that the filler plug is stuck, well you have a problem."

Good advice for any mechanicall undetaking, but not such a severe problem with
the 911 transmission.  If in fact one drains the box and finds the filler plug
can't be pulled, merely reach up on top of the trans and remove the vent.  The
is a easy filler spot if three points are followed: 1) use a "drill pump" or
trans pump as Walt suggested (funnel will not work unless you are willing to
punch a hole through your  rear seat!); 2) watch carefully the number of
quarts (I believe that at least some 911/901 boxes take about 3 quarts of
fluid, so if you buy a gallon of Swepco, measure it as you put it in (that is
an advantage of the fill plug on the side, the level of fluid in the trans is
to be even with the bottom of the hole, which is hard to see if the plug is
stuck in place but not such a problem if you know how much fluid your trans
takes before filling it from the top); and 3) make sure that when replacing
the top ent plug you point the vent hole at the proper angle (I belive that it
is supposed to point 45` from the axis of the trans forward toward the
passnger side).
