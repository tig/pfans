YeeeeHAAAHH!!!

Well, you beat me to it!  I was amassing archives to begin.  Thanks for
stepping up!!!

I was dissecting the .pl file submission.

A job well done!!!

FYI, the search screen goes a bit buggy when you are choosing different
lists - it reverts to prior searches, etc.

But, I am SOOOO happy now.  How will you feed this server?  just have all
the new digests land on the drive?

Ladies and gentlemen:

We've all been whining about the lack of a searchable archive for the
PorscheFans mailing lists, right? Our listmaster doesn't appear to be too
interested in providing us with one, right? So what should we do about it?

Well I know what *I* did about it. I created a fully functional, rich, easy
to use full-text search engine for the archives for all of the PorscheFans
mailing lists. And I'm making it available to everyone. Why did I do this?
Because it was there and it was a challenge!

Please go to http://www.kindel.com/porsche/pfans and check it out for
yourself. If you like it, let me know. If you don't, let me know.

Please don't reply to this mail (this address is not monitored by a human).
If you want to provide me with feedback on what I've done, send mail to me
at ckindel@microsoft.com.

Enjoy!
