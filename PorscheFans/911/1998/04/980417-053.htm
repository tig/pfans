I have that exact setup in my 914. It's a '78 euro SC engine (with the
larger intake ports and valves), stock pistons, 2021 cam, 46IDA Webers (too
big), and Bursch headers. I can't honestly compare performance to anything
but my old '76 911 (much quicker), and my '86 930 (quicker but not nearly
as fast). I assure you that 205/60's are highly insufficient for this much
torque!

I was very concerned with valve clearance and was assured by WebCam that
the 2021 would work. I misinterpreted their timing instructions (different,
yet I think superior to factory method), but had no problems once I
understood. I too considered pistons (Shaasta 9.3's ?), but concluded
another $1,000 was just too much.

I enjoy my 914 much more than the 930. It's a hoot!
