Guys:

Let's be civil here.  I read Scott's original e-mail and have to agree with
him (with the exception of the twin-turbo which most of us would love to own)
on the technical points he made.  Unfortunately, I deleted his post, but, as I
remember he said the C2 was just as fast off the line (true except possibly in
the first foot or two), lighter (true-no arguments there), that the 964 system
was more expensive and complicated that the 993 one but that the 993 one
worked equally well or better in the real world (true), wasn't really worth
the extra money (about $10k for the 964) if you lived in areas where it didn't
snow and where off roading wasn't a big deal (true in my mind), understeered
rather significantly as it came from the factory (very true - he didn't say
this couldn't be cured), etc.  Where's the beef?

All in all, I thought Scott's response to the reader's question was on the
money!

I'd like to know how many of you would have paid the $10k premium for a 964
when they were new?  Seriously?
