I just replaced my Blaupunkt cass with a Blaupunkt CD on my 964.  I had =
the
Reno in the car and added the Denver CD.  My understanding is that the =
low
end Blaupunkts are actually made by Audiovox.  I have used them in other

cars and they seem to work fine, but the real Blau is better.  If the
removable face has push buttons on the back, it is the cheap Audiovox
version, if they are electrical it is a true Blau.  The display is the
annoying green, but I am working on convincing myself that it nicely
matches the green of the fog light switch =3D)
At least during the day it looks totally stock.  BTW the amp is under =
the
passenger seat and you will probably want to remove it, but use that
location for finding speaker wires.

Hi All,


Actually, the Cheaper Blau Units are made by Sony,  they are poor =
quality.  The best head unit on the market is by far the eclipse units.  =
They have surpassed Alpine, and Pioneer.  The Kenwoods are a close =
second.  The sound quality of the eclipse however cannot be matched.  =
Just my $0.02.  I used to own a high end car audio store and specialised =
in Competition car audio systems and installations.

Good luck whatever you decide
