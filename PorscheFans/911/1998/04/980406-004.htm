Dear P-Fans,

I am considering a return to the wonderful world of 911's and would
appreciate any thoughts from 911 owners on the relative merits/problems
of the models within my budget range.

I am looking at Targa's only (We do get the odd sunny day in England
when it's worth having!) and having studied second hand values for some
time it looks as if I would be able to afford pre-85ish models. Prices
seem to jump several thousand pounds for the post-85 models...... I
would be running the car as an occasional daily driver, but mainly as a
weekend vehicle for myself, wife and young (3 year old) daughter. I
would not have a huge repairs budget and besides I want to drive the
thing not wrench it! so I am particularly interested in peoples views as
to the longevity of the main components. I have heard gearboxes for the
early '80's 3:0 litre 911 are suspect at about 80k miles? Is this true?
I am also especially concerned about the dreaded rust worm, having owned
and had to sell a very rotten '72 2.2T about 18mths ago, when I swore
never to enter the world of bottomless repair bills again!

I must confess to also considering a late '80's 944 Turbo on grounds of
practicality so I really need your help and advice guys! Plus I'm trying
to secretly hang onto my '74 914 but the wife is very very wary of
having two "ongoing" projects, so this is serious stuff.....

Hope you can help.

Phil.
