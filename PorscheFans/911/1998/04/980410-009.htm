     Shane,
     
     I had the same problem with on my '77.  If I pulled the Aux. Reg. out 
     and checked it on the bench, it worked properly with the valve being 
     fully closed in about 2 minutes.  Then I checked for voltage at the 
     connector with the ignition key 'ON', had 12V.  So I put it back in 
     assuming it was not the problem and wrote it off.  I searched and 
     checked everything but the high idle still remained.  I then found 
     with the motor warm the valve was still wide open (found this after 
     many hours of searching for other culprits).  I re-checked the voltage 
     at the connector, had 12V.  I pulled the hoses and plugged them, 
     restarted the motor and the idle fell.  What I discovered was that the 
     contact strips inside the connector had slipped back and were not 
     making contact with the socket on the Aux. Reg. so the heating element 
     could not heat up.  I pushed the wires forward and made sure they did 
     not slip back when connected.  The motor idled like a champ.
     Hope this helps.

     ........ This caused the idle to drop from 1200rpm to 750 rpm. After
     inspecting the valve by shing a torch down the hose I could see the 
     vane
     that comes across has not shut off completely. This weekend I will 
     pull
     it apart and see if can be repaired. N.B. I purchased the Bosch CIS 
     Fuel
     Injection booklet which gave me a reasonable guide to how it worked, 
     but
     contains no fault finding tips.
