<< Remember, the higher the DOT rating, the higher the performance. >>

I do not believe this is exactly true.  The performance number that we, as
enthusiasts look for, is the dry boiling point and I believe that you can buy
the Ford Heavy Duty brake fluid or ATE blue or 200 or AP 550 (DOT 3/550 degree
F boiling point) or 600, all of which have higher dry boiling points than the
normal Pep Boys/KMart/Walmart/etc. brands, although they probably have the
same DOT numbers.  I'd bet AP 600, with a >572 degree F dry boiling point is
higher than most or all DOT 5.0 or 5.1 fluids.  (Castrol LMA :-( has a dry
boiling point of 446.)  The DOT numbers refer, I believe, to some specific
test procedure that the fluid passes, which includes some dry boiling point
minimum that the fluid must exceed to obtain that rating.  Lower DOT number
fluids may, and in many cases do, have higher DOT numbers.  The numbers have a
corollary with the SAE ratings on oils (where, as I've been told, the latest
rating SH or whatever, is a bit of a compromise, to the benefit of certain
American auto companies by allowing lower prices on factory fill oils, too).

Also, remember that all brake fluids are 'synthetic.'
