I own a 1991 964 which I autocross with the NNJR Porsche Club.  The only
thing that I have done is put R1 Tires on the car to improve handling.  In the
stock C6 class I have to run against RS America's which have the capability
of adjusting their suspensions to lower the car.

Is there anything that I can do to remain stock while lowering the car slightly.
I compared my car to one of the RS's and there seemed to be about a one
inch difference in clearance between the top of the tire and the fender.  The 
RS seemed to sit about an inch lower.

I purchased my car with 19K on it and I do not know if it has any options that
would effect the ride height.  I was told that some C2 cars had adjustable ride
heights.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Chuck
