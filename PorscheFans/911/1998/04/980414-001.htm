Dear Porschefans,
I'd like to read on this list something more than how to replace
clutches
and spark plugs! For instance how to judge last weekend Porsche defeat
at
Oschersleben?
After a pole in qualifying, the GT1/98 retreated under the pressure of
three
Mercedes CLK and the traditional superiority in GT2 was broken by Vipers
..
Do you think is that just a juvenile training period or, according to
you,
is it now very difficult (impossible) for an independent small company
as
Porsche to compete against Big boys or Little boys with Big brothers?
Can we
afford a looser Porsche?
Let me know your impressions.

Aldo

Hello to Porschefans and Aldo

First off all I must say: I was there and I saw that Mercedes have had
absolutelly no chance against Porsche. The Porsche Factory team was 2-5
sec!!!! per lap faster, and the semi factory team Zakspeed  exactlly as
fast as Mercedes. Porsche had Tires defect and a worn cv joint 30 laps
before the end of the race. So Mercedes was just lucky this time. The
GT1 has 50 hp less than the Mercedes but it is a better car and lighter.
Good for the slower tracks like Oscherslaben but bad for tracks like
Silverstone and Hockenheim. We will see. I think even with 50 hp less
the GT1 98 will be very competitive in the high speed tracks.

The GT2 is another story. The 8 liter Viper former a bad GT1 car with no
chance at the GT1 class, is very fast in the GT2 serie. The "old" 911
GT2 had no chance. The GT2 has now less hp than last year. It was 600 hp
at 1996, 550hp 1997 and now 520 hp. I don't know what kind of peoples
are made this rules but the Vipers seems to have + 100 hp more than the
Porsches. They accelerating much faster out of the corners and had tons
of torque. If nothing would change on the GT2 rules you can forgett
Porsche :-((

Konstantin
PS don't forgrtt that the Vipers are semi factory teams and the 911 GT2
is just a private team. (Roock etc)
