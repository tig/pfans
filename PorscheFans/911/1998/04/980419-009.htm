Help!
I have a 1981 911SC. I recently experienced a vacume leak and suspected
the manifold boots. I dropped the engine and discovered a cracked air
box. While waiting for the new airbox I decided to generally clean up
the engine and the fuel injection components. I cleaned and polished the
aluminum manifold tubes and started pulling the injectors from each
tube. The first came out fine. The second the whole insert came out with
the injector and the third appeared to crumble the insert.

The insert is a non-metallic composite material.  I am sure that if I
try to pull all of the injectors that all of the inserts are in the same
condition. The rubber 'O' ring around the injector is hard as a rock
there is a good chance that this is the first time they have been
pulled. Being so hard  and inflexible they are breaking the insert.

Anyone know anything about this?

I have a complete, or at least I thought complete, set of shop manuals.
The description of injector removal and the picture would make it look
like ther is a larger rubber boot that injector presses into. This is
not so on my car.

Can I get new inserts and press them into the manifold tubes ?
