Sure you can.  That's the way I did it. :>)  I borrowed the "special tool"
needed
to remove the nut on the bottom of the ball joint (thanks Jon Lowe) and used
an impact wrench to get it off.

The Haynes Manual is notorious for lulling you into a false sense of
security.  IMHO, removing the ball joints - either the nut on the bottom
or the pin through the strut - is the hardest part.  The a-arm itself will
come off pretty easily.  One of the ball joint pins came out relatively easily,
the other had to be drilled out after I pounded it into oblivion.

If you plan on replacing the a-arm bushings, I would remove the arm
completely, otherwise you could probably avoid disturbing that monster.

Good luck,
