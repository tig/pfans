Luis,

I also have an idling problem with my '90 964 C4. Mine usually occures
when I first start the car.

At start up it will either sputter and die or it will start and the rpm
will hunt from about 250-1500 rpm until settling down. Once I start
driving off everything settles down and works fine.

I've had the O2 sensor changed in the past but the problem is still
there.

I recently changed over the mass flow sensor and chip to one offered by
Autothority I still have the problem but once the car gets going it goes
a little faster now.

Let me know what you find with yours.

Nigel

Subject: 964 Idling problem



I know there has been some talk about this topic for the 87 Carrera =
Series.  It must be a flu going around.  My 964 (90 C4 Cab) started =
yesterday to nearly stall at idle until it finally stabilizes at about =
200 RPM.  It has stalled several times while driving and the problem =
doesn't seem to be going away by itself.

Has any of you 964 owners had any idling problems?

Appreciate any help.

Luis
