Hey all,

How in the heck are you suppose to get the old bushings off of the
spring plate? It's sitting on my bench laughing at me.. Why do
people make things that a press can't work on????...

Also am I looking at this correctly and to do the rear
banana/trailer arm bushings I have to remove the entire rear
suspension, brake, axle, shock, sway bar etc.etc? This one is not
going to be so fun.. More DAMN allen heads, how can you accurately
torque an allen bolt(ya I know an allen socket!) especially when
it's in a very important place, like holding your axle in place..
GRRRR.. Sometimes I think the designers spent too much time at the
Oktoberfests, under the tables!! (no flames, just having some
fun!) Plus I have been to some Oktoberfests. Just wish when I
lived in Singlefingen (15 minutes away from stuttgart) I would of
check out the Porsche facility, but was too young to think about
anything but gummi bears.

Later all,
