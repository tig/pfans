Getting ready for spring (yes it is still cold up here in the land of
icicle heads), and would like to spray the underside and wheel wells
with a antirust/wax material just to help keep the tin worm at bay.

In Europe they sell a product called Waxoyl which is basically a waxy
oil (name seems logical) which is transparent and does need renewing
from time to time. I don't really need an undercoating (sprayed the
underside after bead blasting with anti rust etch, primer, chip
guard/underseal, colour and clear).

Extreme paranoia causes me to want to put on one last coat in the hopes
of keeping things pristine.

Is anyone aware of an equivalent to waxoyl that may be available in
Canada? The closest I have found is a 3M product intended for doing door
cavities and such (also done), but I guess it washes off relatively
easily.

Thanks
