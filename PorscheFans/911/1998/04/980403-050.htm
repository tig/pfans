I used to have a 72 911 T also.  It was my very first Porsche (with the self-
destructive "gas" door on the right rear quarter).   I have spent an
incredible amount of time under that hood.  At times I would lay under that
car & smile from ear to ear, and at other times I could feel a  tear swelling
in my eye.  One of the biggest mechanical problems that I encountered with
that car,  was a substantial amount of RUST  in the fuel system.  I swapped
out the mechanical injection for 40IDA-3C Webers,  upgraded the ignition,
installed WR-7DP plugs, and last...but not least, a transparent glass fuel
filter.  It was the best $12 that I ever spent on that car.   On several
occasions, I would be driving along and the car would start to lose power and
die.   when I opened the hood and peered in,  "Whooaaa, what do ya know",  the
transparent fuel filter was PACKED with rust particles!!  I began carrying a
13mm wrench and latex gloves (Not required: I hate the smell of gas on my
hands) and when the filter would plug up, I would simply pull over and clean
it.  Whallaaa, the car would start and drive great.  

Although this solution worked on my car, your car may be different, and I may
be able to give you some more tips if I knew which fuel system you currently
have on your car.  If you have mechanical FI, be careful not to install a fuel
filter that will not sustain those higher fuel pressures.   I would be more
than happy to answer any questions that you may have or hear more symptoms...
just e-mail them to me.

Good Luck!!
