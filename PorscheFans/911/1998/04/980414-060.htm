Charlie, Rob, others:

You can find specifics on Leland-West insurance at www.lelandwest.com

I researched this for my new-to-me 1988 Targa, which looks like it might
become the third car since no one's buying my 96 Infiniti at the moment,
and the wife won't part with my 95 BMW 325i cabrio.

The basic deal is, you can't drive more than 5,000 miles a year, can't take
it to work, ever (unless your other car is in the shop - there's a
loophole, I suppose), have to have it in a locked garage (they want a photo
of where it lives) at home, and they won't cover it on the track. The
liability coverage rate can't be any higher than your insurance on your
other cars, I guess so they don't get involved if you wrap your SUV around
somebody else.

The annual premium, however, is less than half of my State Farm insurance
to have my 88 as a "regular" car. I do have an excellent driving record
though - I never get caught - thanks to my Valentine One! The Leland-West
premium for me is $525 a year. State Farm is about $1300 a year.

At this point, I'm not using them, because I am so infatuated with the car
that I'm driving it everywhere - already put 2,000 miles on it in 5 weeks
... ain't gonna make that 5,000 cut that way.

Biggest attraction for me was the lower cost and the fact that I could tell
them my car (23,000 miles) is worth $27,500, and that's exactly what they'd
pay if, God forbid, it was totaled or stolen. State Farm, on the other
hand, wants to "replace" the car through a wholesaler, or repair it with
non-Porsche parts. I suppose they'd give me about $15k wholesale for it if
it's lost.

My best advice would be, if you fit their profile now, go for it. If you'd
have to stop driving the car as much as you'd like, it's probably not for
you. Me, I like to pop the top and drive the 28 freeway miles to the office
with a smile :-) - to hell with the Infiniti unless it's raining. We do
have hurricanes here in Florida ...
