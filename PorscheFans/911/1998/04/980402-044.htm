Wow, Steve, I didn't realize you are an asshole.  Why didn't you tell
me?

Gee, here all along I thought you were a pretty decent guy, especially
since you are always able to answer my questions about various mods to
my 911, which has saved me many hours of time, and absolutely no benefit
to you.  I guess I  missed out on your pissing and whining too.  I must
have been sick that day, I guess...

If I had busted my butt for 8-10 years to get an engineering doctorate,
I think I'd be Dr. Bob.  If I need help or advice, and I have a choice
between someone who has practical experience and someone who has
education and practical experience, there's no question I'll go with the
guy who has the theoretical backround as well as the hands on.  But hey,
what do I know.

Remember what Einstein said about mediocre minds.

Bob Brewer
Davis, CA
