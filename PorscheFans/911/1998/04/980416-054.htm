John,

I agree with Eric Schulof regarding Lexol for vinyl; I have also found
Meguiar's (#40) Vinyl and Rubber Cleaner/Conditioner to be a good,
reasonably priced product.  For exterior rubber, I like Forever Black,
which is a two-step cleaner/conditioner product.  Be careful using the
conditioner, which is almost like a stain - especially avoid getting it
on the paint.  Does produce a nice result, however.  Also note that Car
Care Specialties (201.796.8300) has a special on a product called Black
Again (20% off from now until 5/15), which is used for exterior trim.  I
haven't tried this yet but plan on ordering some to check it out.
Avoiding the paint on a whaletail is a pain, so I'd like to see if this
makes the task easier.

Hope this helps.  I have heard that having a nicely detailed car adds at
least 25 horsepower (to the owner, not the car!).
