I know this subject has been around before but I haven't been able to 
find what I'm looking for.

What do these chips actually do?  I'm an engineer and it just seems like 
you don't get something for nothing.  What are the tradeoffs?  I assume 
that the DME can only control fuel flow to the injectors, and timing.

One person (with a BMW) told me chips improve performance slightly (~5%) 
but you absolutely have to use premium gas and the mileage goes down a 
little.  Wouldn't the knock sensors still keep it from pinging even with 
normal octane gas?  Others have told me that you get more power, more 
low-end torque, a higher rev. limit, and it does everything but wash 
your windshield.

Whats the truth?  Do you people who have installed them feel that you 
got your moneys worth, and would you recommend it?  Any draw-backs?

Thanks for your input,

Tom Westenburg
