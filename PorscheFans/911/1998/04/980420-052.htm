I've used Dent Wizard in Bellevue WA twice. Once at Barrier Motors when they
put a door ding in my car and once on my own when *I* caused the door ding.

The first time the ding did not have any paint marring or scratching. It was
obviously caused by a "kiss". Came out flawlessly.

The 2nd time the ding was caused by something falling on the door in the
garage. I almost cried when I saw it and noticed that the paint was marred.
It wasn't scratched, just marred. I took it to Dent Wizard, the guy looked
at it and said "no problem". He was right. The repair was flawless. If I
remember correctly it cost about $170. Well worth it in my opinion. I
supposed I could find someone who would do it for less, but since Barrier
Motors choose these guys I figured they  were a quality outfit. And they
are.

One that I will survey here, does anyone have any experience with
"paintless dent removal"?  My 911 has one small concave dent on the
roof, no
scratch - no seam, looks like a softball or something got it.  The car
is
otherwise perfect, and although I can probably live with it I would lke
to
have it smooth. Is only about 2" across at it's widest point and maybe
1/4"
deep at the most.  Difficult to even see unless the sun hits it right.

I have an 83SC.  Recently I had it serviced at Freddy Baker's place in
Bedford Ohio.  They offered the services of one of the dent wizard
types.  For about $165  I got a fifty cent piece size dent near my
driver's door done as well as some other minor dents and one major
crease in my engine compartment lid (put there by a Porsche CAN person
several years ago at a clinic!).
I am very pleased with the result except that at a certain angle I can
see the paint is slightly odd looking in the area of the larger dent.  I
think that this was due to the paint surface having been distorted so
long in the dent.  Otherwise it looks great...and only someone
determined to find something wrong probably could find this one blemish.
For the money and the result it is great.  I would do it again.  Beats
the snot out of pounding, filling, sanding, and painting.
WSC 83SC slate blue and perfectly smooth now thank you very much
