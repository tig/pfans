Get the evil Castrol out of your engine!!  That will probably help your oil
pressure.  I had used Castrol 20W50 for years in my other vehicles and
used it in the 911 when I first bought it.  At one of my first track events, my
instructor (also one of our region's resident tech experts) leaned over and
said, "You're using Castrol, aren't you?".  I asked how he knew.  He said
my oil pressure was low.  Sure enough, I began using Valvoline Racing
20W50 and my oil pressure actually increased noticably.  I have also
heard other bad things about Castrol in 911 engines, but don't have any
first hand experience other than the oil pressure.

I would definetely try another brand of oil.
