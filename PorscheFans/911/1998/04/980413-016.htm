I'm surprised that this question didn't produce a zillion replies. 
Joe, my view is as follows:

rear engine = better traction = better acceleration.
            = better braking since the car is less nose heavy under
              braking than a front engine car.

Lift throttle oversteer. Bimmers do it too <grin>. The 964 and 
especially the 993 with the SLA rear suspension have cured the 
oversteer problem almost completely. Lifting in the middle of a high 
speed corner is less risky than it once was. On the other hand, 
lifting off in an M3 is something which one also approaches very 
delicately. 

Both cars have extraordinary abilities.  Watching them race, I 
observe that the 911's are faster on some corners than the M3's and 
natch, the M3's are quicker on turns more suited to their layout. Same 
applies to 911's and 944 turbos. Different but fast. 

Front engine cars handle off camber turns better than 911's in 
general, the 911 gets floaty in the front end (scary actually), same 
with turns over the crest of a hill.  On the other hand, 911's can 
accelerate harder out of the corner, hence the 911 maxim, slow in, 
fast out.  At the end of the day, the driver's skill makes the 
difference.
