The car is a 90 C4 Cab.

Initially I thought the "hard to get to" plugs had not been replaced last
time because when I disconect the main wire that comes from the coil to the
primary distributor (the one that drives the hidden plugs) the car wouldn't
start.  Now I'm thinking the problem might be elsewere because if I switch
to the primary distributor the main wire that comes from the other coil ,
the car starts fine (using the same plugs and distributor that wouldn't
start before). There is spark on that wire so the coil is sending high
voltage.  I tested the resistance of both coils and seems identical at 0.6
Ohms.  I also tested the resistance of the coil wires (the ones that run to
the distributors) and those are pretty much a straight wire with non or
little resistance. I'm wondering what could be causing this problem.

Thanks a lot to all that reply explaining how to replace the hidden spark
plugs on my C4.  I will try that this weekend and post an update.

Hi again,

Seems we are going through very similar things with our C4's.  I just
changed the top six plugs with the Bosch tri-tip.  They are the recommended
plug from several sources.  Changing just the top six greatly improved the
feel.  Mine looked original with 55k on the car.  The gap had increased
from .34 to over .40.  Five of the top six were pretty easy.  Just remove
the heater duct for the drivers side, to gain access to those three.  The
passenger side has one tough one.  I took out the airbox and using the
Porsche tool from the kit and some patience was able to remove the front
most plug.  Thought things were going well, then I discovered (through this
list) that I would have to remove the exhaust.  It is VERY heavy.  About 60
lbs.  Since I needed a valve job, I took it in (today) to have the valves
done and the lower spark plugs replaced.  They suggested adding a 'power
tube' which replaces about 60 lbs of muffler, SLIGHTLY increases HP and in
their opinion improves the sound.

I will let you know how it goes.  I am figuring on $500 for everything.  By
the way, shop for the plugs.  Prices ranged from $12 to $3.50.  Buy 12,
that kind of money adds up.

Let me know if you have any questions.
