Fellas:
	Thanks a bunch to all of you who helped me with my brakes... you 
guys saved me alot of headaches.	
	Now, I'm on to the lighting problems I have on my '78 SC. 
	(hey, I'm on a roll here. I might as well keep on going, right?)

	1. Luggage compartment light - my manual mentions a switch for 
the luggage compartment light. Where is this switch located? Mine seems 
to have been removed. There is a brown wire dangling, but no switch. Any 
thoughts on this?
	2. Back-up lights - All of the other lights (turns, brakes and 
parking) work, but no back up lights. I checked the bulbs and they're 
OK. Anyone got any ideas as to where I might start on this one?   
	3. Hi-beam headlights - When I push the turn signal lever, the 
hi-beams do not come on. I recently replaced the sealed-beam headlights 
with H4's, but the hi-beams never worked even with the original sealed 
beams in either. I'd really like to get this one figured out... not 
having hi-beams really sucks when I'm out here in the sticks.
	4. Fog lights - The previous owner had mounted the fog 
light housings on the car, but never wired them in. I've purchased the 
fog light switch and wiring kit from Performance Products. Any general 
comments, or hints as to where to start with this project would be a 
great help.

	I realize I'm asking alot of questions here, so any help you 
guys could give on any or all of them would be a BIG help. I'm hoping I 
can get some good advice from the list that will help me jump-start 
these "new" projects.

	Thanks in advance,

	Andy Zimmerman
