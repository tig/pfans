David:

I highly recommend he take the car to Frank Eibell in Clearwater (not far
at all from Tarpon Springs). The shop is Eibell Performance, I believe the
number's 813-573-0911 but information would have it if I'm off.

I've known Frank for years, he is a man of absolute integrity, and his
mechanics know their stuff. In fact, Frank has a policy of doing free
pre-purchase inspections for his customers. He looked over two 911's for me
before I bought my new 88 last month.

I don't think the free inspection includes a leakdown/compression, but if
he's taking it to the dealer anyway, he could get it done there.  Or just
pay Frank to do it.

Other decent shops in the area are German Motorcars in Safety Harbor and
Dave White Autosports in Tampa. But IMO Eibell's the best, heavily involved
in the local club, etc. I can also recommend an excellent body shop if he
wants someone to see if it's been hit or painted.

Sorry to say I don't know the car or Bill, but if he wants someone to take
a peek at it before he takes to the air, I'd be happy to. I'm on my third
911 now, don't know a whole lot about waterpumpers, but I know a dog when I
see it ....

>A good friend of mine is looking at Bill Deland's (sp??) '90 944S2 Cab.  He
