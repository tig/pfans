What a blast driving this  baby.  I consider myself lucky.  Just installed a
new "aspen"
Blaupunkt radio and a CD changer.  Put the changer under the passenger
seat.  This is the beginning of a complete upgrade of the radio system.
Want to do the speakers next.  This leads me to my question.  What is a
really neat way to put some decent speakers in the rear.  Don't see much
room, but thought some of the experts out there has developed something
really good or has some good ideas.  Not going wild with the system, but
want the good sound I'm used to in my daily driver(Mark VIII)

*******James-
congrats on buying one helluva car ('86 930).  And now, on to your stereo
system:
It's not too difficult to get some really good sound into your Porsche.  (I
would personally find your Mark VIII more challenging-especially trying to
get bass from the trunk into the interior!).  There are some fellows up in
Oregon "Original Fit Interiors", who make a rear deck replacement piece
which houses 2 6x9 speakers.  I spoke with one of the fellows (541-679-4460)
and he sounded like a good guy, but I have not seen the fit or quality of
the product.  It's not completely airtight, but it ought to offer some
"punch" compared to just 4x6's in the stock rear deck.  Otherwise, some
really decent 5.25" 2-ways or "separates" work well in the doors-but don't
expect any real bass.  If you're looking for better quality bass and lower
midrange, (here we go), you'll probably want one or more subwoofers.  I
build one subwoofer enclosure for a pair of 8 inch subwoofers, (bear this in
mind as I offer my "advice"),  and there is another company called ZBox who
builds an enclosure that houses 2 10" subwoofers.  Both fit in the rear of
the car, but I was unable to get ahold of ZBox the last time I tried calling
them.  (ZBox was bought by SoundQuest, who was bought by Recoton, and now
Recoton just bought Aamp of America-but they're not aware of the ZBox
products.  I called the SoundQuest 800#, and it was forwarded to Aamp).
After a while, they'll probably become available again.  The upgraded radio
and CD changer are a great first step, you can check out some tips that I
have posted on my website for stereo systems in the 911,
www.caraudioinnovations.com .  I've also seen some people cut holes in the
rear side panels of coupes and Targas and mount speakers there, but keep in
mind that the speaker has to be mounted rigidly, and as close to "airtight"
as possible.  You probably don't want to really alter your 930 that much,
either, unless you pick up some spare panels.

Sorry if I went on too much, I can elaborate more if you email me directly,
but I'll be out of town for a week starting 4/16 in the
afternoon(vacation!).   More details can be found on the website.
