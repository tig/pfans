Welcome to the world of 911s and the 915 transmission (used in 911s from '72
through '86). I had an '86 with similar symptoms. I had the trans rebuilt.
It needed new 1st and 2nd gear syncros and 2nd gear slider and dog teeth.
These are very typical wear points for the 915. Such a rebuild is on the
order of $1K from a good p-car wrench. More if you don't pull the
engine/transmission yourself. I was quoted $1200 by one mechanic. I did the
R&R myself and saved about $200. This is also a real good time to do the
clutch.

How soon should you do this? Whenever your patience runs out. If you are
careful, you can drive it for quite some time in this condition. I would at
the very least change the fluid and put in Swepco 201. It may help somewhat.

The bottom line for 915 transmissions is shift slowly. You cannot power
shift them; they will self destruct if you do that. Just take your time and
finesse the shift. This is true even on 915s in like-new condition. It is
part of your car's character!

Another tip that a highly regarded local mechanic, Chris Powell, gave me was
always shift while the car is moving. When downshifting while coming to a
stop, pull it out of third or whatever before you stop moving. Now if your
first gear syncros are shot, you won't be able to put it into first, but at
least put it into neutral before stopping completely.

Good luck!

Hi PFans,

About a month ago I bought a 78 SC, my first, lots of miles (170K) but
recent engine rebuild.  I was planning on waiting a few more years &
getting something newer but the price was right so I jumped on in.  No
regrets :-)

The trans has the following symptoms, which predictably waited until
last week to show up...

1.  Kind of hard to shift into first when moving, but not a big problem.

2.  1->2 or 3->2 shifts can be (but aren't always) difficult, it never
grinds but sometimes you have to tug pretty hard.  (Occasionally I end
up holding the shift knob :-)  )  It seems to be worst when things
aren't yet warmed up.  This seems to be gradually getting worse, though
it could be that I'm just shifting at higher rpms now that i'm less
afraid :-)

3.  Occasionally on a shift out of 3rd the transmission pops out of
gear.  It never happens by itself.

4.  ... and a quiet (but I keep noticing it) high-pitched whine in 5th
which comes and goes.

As I have no real experience with auto repair (yet) I don't think I want
to start with a transmission rebuild (new heater cables first, maybe) so
I would be looking at having the work done.  My impression is that this
means I'll be spending $500-$1000 for a rebuild?  Or could (should) I
get away with just some new synchros?  

Having only driven cars whose transmissions have less "character"
(golfs, 944s), I also don't really know how worried I should be. 

I'm interested in a little advice before I go walking into a shop with
my wallet out.  Having once replaced my Golf transmission because i let
it go on acting weird for too long, I don't want to blow this off.  

Thanks in advance,
Scott
