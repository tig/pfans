Nigel,
My experience was actually a little worse. My car refused to idle.  My
"local" dealer used a Bosch "Hammer" to make the computer adapt.  I was
told this could usually be done by driving it, but the signals were so
different at idle, there was no alternative.  It now idled but required
2 tries to start and the idle fluctuated all the time.  I called
Autothority and found they had sent me the wrong chip.  Installed the
correct chip; and cold start problem improved (less idle fluctuation),
but still required two tries.  Even this went away and the car now
starts first time.  Went for a ride last night after sitting for a week
and the idle started at 1000 and stayed, no variation at all.  Seems to
be continuing to improve. My guess is your mechanic is right, this will
self correct. For me it took 10+ cold starts to correct.

I still like the Mass Flow Sensor's performance above 3500rpm versus
stock but would love to have more low end grunt without buying varioram
for around town driving.
