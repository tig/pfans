>Hi All
>
>I'm trying to diagnose my headlight washer system on an 84 Euro 911 turbo.
>I think it's the relay, but I'm not sure.
>
>I have noticed that I seem to have a defective switch, which I will
replace.
>It offers intermittent infinite resistance when closed...
>
>Also, I notice that when I offer +12 to one of the gray sets on the relay,
>it fires, and operates the pump.
>
>Now, my questions:
>
>1. Do the grays function as a trigger, firing the relay when closed?
>
>2. Are one of the gray sets of wires feeding the relay supposed to be wired
>to +12?  The diagram seems to illustrate this, although no voltage is
>present at the grays (relay marked "S")  When I do offer +12 to either
gray,
>the pump operates.
>
>This seems to suggest a stuck/bad portion of the relay.  It does seem odd
>that when I feed +12 to the grays, it operates continuously, regardless of
>the switch position.  This suggests that the switch is not properly
shutting
>down the +12 to one set of the grays, and that perhaps the grays are "fused
>together"
>
>Anyone out there with EE skills and fixed H/L washers?

>Thanks in Advance!
