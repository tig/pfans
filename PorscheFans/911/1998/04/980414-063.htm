Hey List,
I just need some reassurances from true performance addicts.
  The other day I was in a chat room and I was attacked for wanting to
recreate the '74 911 Carerra RS Lightweight. They all said I was ruining
a perfectly good 911 by "butchering" it.
  They said I wouldn't gain anything on my "ET" by reducing the weight
of my interior.
  Of course they all drive 5,000 pound muscle cars that a few pounds
here and there wouldn't gain them anything.
 I also couldn't get it across that not all car freaks drag race.
 So please tell me I am doing the right thing by trying to recreate a
classic Porsche, and not butchering a perfectly good 911.


Later, Shawn
