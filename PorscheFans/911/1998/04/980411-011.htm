Jim:

I have had 17-in MXX3s on my RS America for 3 months (M30 suspension
with H&R lowering springs) which is pretty stiff and found the tires
ride softer than the previous BFGs. (On the straight of my favorite
track my helmet was bouncing off the roof with the BFGs, I was surprised
to realize it wasn't happening with the MXX3s. They my be relatively
harsher than the SP8000s, but I wouldn't call them harsh. Even with this
stiff suspension I find the ride very comfortable with little intrusive
tire noise. They do tell you what kind of surface you are driving on,
but they don't shout. If they are harsher than the Dunlops (which I also
highly respect), it is a matter of degrees. I finally settled on the
MXX3s after being assured by several sources that they have a longer
tread life. Incidently, I find they really settle the rear end which was
rather twitchy with the BFGs.
