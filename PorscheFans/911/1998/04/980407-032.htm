Subject: Stereo System in a 911
Does anyone have good recommendations on stereo
systems in a 911.  I am getting real close to doing a
deal with a local outfit.  Eclipse head unit, Eclipse and
Dynaudio speakers and a 12" Rockford Fosgate Sub in
the front trunk area, 2 Eclipse AMPS.  Looking for input
from anyone out there as to what you have done and
how you have been able to get good bass in your car.
Thanks
Buddy

*****Hey Buddy, (sounds like a line...?)
I don't know how to effectively "vent" a subwoofer from the trunk area into
the cabin.  I've heard different accounts of people either disabling some of
the heater/ventilation ducts to allow the sound from the trunk to reach the
interior of the car, or "cutting holes" (OUCH!) to achieve this, but I don't
think I'd do either to my own car.  If you're handy and want to do some of
the work yourself, or if you just want to understand more so that you can
make some educated decisions, I have posted a whole bunch of rambling about
stereos in these cars on my website, www.caraudioinnovations.com .  I've got
to warn you, I build a subwoofer enclosure for these cars myself, so you can
interpret my advice knowing that. ;)

If you're dealing with someone to install your stuff, make sure that they're
reputable, that they work on Porsches "successfully", and that they truly
understand your needs and concerns.  Find out if they're willing to let you
know exactly what alterations they'll be doing to your car, so that you can
decide up front.  Sometimes, there's no "going back", and it can cost more
money to correct some of that work and then have it done right.  Some things
can't be reversed.  I don't want to sound too paranoid, but many of us are
very cautious about what we do with our cars, whether the Porsche designers
would have done it the same way.  I really like people who treat my car as I
would, when working on it.  Feel free to email me directly for any other
questions.  These cars really respond well to a good, basic sound system,
making the "Porsche experience" an even richer one.

Eclipse stuff has a good reputation, and Dynaudio is one of the best brands
I've encountered, but remember that the installation is going to make or
break a good sounding system, from mounting/wiring components right down to
checking the phase of each speaker.
