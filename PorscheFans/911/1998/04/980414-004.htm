You can plug the brake line whilst change the calliper, however another
trick is to also put a block of wood on the brake pedal to depress it
just enough to stop fluid leaking through.

To be honest you're going to bleed the brakes afterwards anyway and
you might as well bleed them all and flush all the fluid through. Just
use a new bottle of brake fluid rather than one that's been opened and
DOT4/5.1 - shop around on prices as the top end fluids can be had under
other names for much less (like Ford HD brake fluid and so on).

Now the non-hygroscopic fluids like DOT 5 whilst not taking up waterwill
give a slightly spongier pedal but any water that gets into the system
will pool. Water is most likely to get in at the callipers, where
pooling will occur which isn't too useful. For rarely driven cars it
is useful, otherwise I'd stick to DOT4/5.1. 5.1 is absolutely fine.

Your life depends on the brake fluid and getting a firm pedal, but it
is so easy to do it's easily done every year or pre-track events etc.
