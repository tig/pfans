Water injection kits are often used by some works rally teams. 
o www.aquamist.co.uk which do a basic WI for 250ukp/350$US rising to a
  complex 3D mappable ECU controlled system for high fuel/boost apps.

o The pump is an electromagnetic piston (sole moving part) pump which is
  a billet machined aluminium thing, 200psi and 0.3L/min metering. Flow
  is adjusted to this max by a tube dia of 4 or 6mm and about 10 nozzle
  sizes from 0.6-1.0mm in two tube sizes. It's a true atomising system.

o You can also fit in one of their solenoids for fail-safe no-drip, it
  can be WOT or vacuum/boost manifold pressure operated and so on.

  It is a 1 minute on, 1 minute off device re temperature ~15Amps. The
  ultra-fine spray is directional in a 30-degree stream I'd guess.

Works for decarboning, high-boost apps, but of course it would do fine
sprayed at an intercooler, oil cooler, AC condensor or knowing the AC in
a 911 perhaps at owners in standing 100oF+ heat :-) Add ice to water.

Personally on a 911 I'd use the "proper" solution for an app, such as
a bigger intercooler or lower oil-cooler-fan-stat. For spraying a fine
atomised mist through the N-blade cooling fine it might be useful. Might
make a neat stealth device in the middle of corners :-)
"Uh... steam... that's a 911 <in front of BMW M3>... water in a 911?!"
