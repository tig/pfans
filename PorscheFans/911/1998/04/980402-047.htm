Not an attack, just some polite (I hope) comments:

I really don't think it's fair to draw the conclusion that the
factory M3s are dominating the 911s in GT3 because of any inherent
liablities in the rear engine layout. There are a number of other
factors that must be considered. First and foremost is money.

There is an old saying that "speed is money, how fast do you want to
spend?". You are comparing the success of a well funded factory
racing effort to that of a number of private entries. Furthermore,
you are neglecting the fact that the most well funded 911 teams
compete in GT2 (where they win with a fair degree of regularity).
What remains in GT3 are some great Porsche drivers and cars operating
on some very modest budgets. If you compare the success of similar
private M3 entries with that of the 911s, the theory of rear-engine
inferiority crumbles. In the battles further down the leader board
the assets and liabilities of both front and rear engine layouts tend
to balance out. Skill, strategy, and luck become the factors that
determine success.
