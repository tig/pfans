I recently purchased a rust-free 1978 911 Targa with 87K from the original
owner.  It needs at little work, but I should be on the road shortly.  

I took the car to a local import mechanic to fix the "little stuff."  It needs
a voltage regulator for the alternator, a regulator for the passenger window
and an oil tank,  which it is leaking.  

The mechanic recommended a new tank to the tune of around $800.  I called
around to several used parts places and have found used tanks for
significantly less.  I mentioned this to the mechanic, he said that I should
still go with the new tank because there may be metal pieces or foreign
objects in the used tank.  My question is whether or not it's worth extra
$500-600 to buy a new tank.  Couldn't I run some parts cleaner through the
used tank to get any crud out and buy one of the those magnetized oil plugs?
Also, it seems like a decent used Porsche parts dealer wouldn't be selling
rusty tanks with exploded engine parts in them...

Thanks.
