I just read a message from some individual who was badmouthing Steve 
Timmins. I have had the opportunity to deal with Steve on a couple of 
ocassions. He was honest and helpful. If that makes one an asshole, 
then I would like to apply. As for the letters after his name, if 
he earned then, then he can certainly put them in his signatire if he 
likes. As for the individual doing the name calling, perhaps we 
could develop some letters for you to place after your name if it 
would make you feel better.
I really enjoy this list and find it to be a great  source of 
technical information and entertainment. If you want to badmouth 
someone, please do it offline. If I wanted to listen to people call 
others names, I would listen to Slick Willie and spouse.
Tom Oxner (I will not put letters after my name as it might provoke 
an attack)
