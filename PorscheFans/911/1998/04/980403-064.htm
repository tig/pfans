Sorry, I forgot to mention that I tested this in my car, a 90 C4 =
Cabriolet.

P heard,
=20
It is not my intention to get this topic going again but, I receive a =
K&N filter and I measured the performance change and I thought some of =
you might like to see the results.
=20
I used a G-Tech accelerometer to measure HP at the rear wheels.  I made =
5 measurements with the old dirty paper filter and 5 with the K&N filter =
and calculated the average.  I did this over a small period of time so =
the air temperature (weather) was the same for both filters (40 F).
=20
Well, there was absolutely no increase in HP with the K&N filter.  My =
car is completely stock.  May be a car that has been modified with =
upgraded exhaust and Chip would experience that 10% increase I heard =
people talk about in more than one occasion.

Well, thought you like to know.
