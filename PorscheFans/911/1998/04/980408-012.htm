Hi,

I agree entirely - for me, keeping the list as a mailing list (rather
than web-based, etc) is a must. The current list software is brain-dead,
and has been since PorscheFans' inception. A bunch of this have been
over-n-over-n-over the issue before. Unfortunately, there is little
impetus from an administrative point of view to change things.

There's lots of great mailing list software out there, all that's needed
is someone who can manage the lists. We don't really have that now - pfans
is being managed on an ad-hoc basis "as time permits", meaning that the
current admin probably only checks it's functioning once a week or so.

Cross-posting to a Usenet group will signal the death of Porschefans.
Take a look at the existing 'alt.autos.porsche'... the signal-to-noise
ratio there is so low that it's not worth reading. Porschefans, on the other
hand, has a very very high signal-to-noise ratio.

This is common with EVERY situation where I've seen a mailing list and
a news group purported to perform the same function.

One man's opinion...
