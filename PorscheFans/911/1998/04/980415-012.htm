> 	Hi BOB:
		Sorry for your predicament- your UPS charges and aggravation factor must
be quite high. I will offer a Fabspeed system that will have a lifetime
warranty on the muffler and etc. My muffler is T304SS 16 Guage versus the
paper thin 22 guage one you have. The muffler you have is constructed on a
sheetmetal brake like the ductwork was created in your  home or business'-
HVAC system. Fabspeed muffler cases are formed on a gigantic multi-ton
press like Porsche does on their systems
	The short term problem is that I need a Carrera 3.2 with B&B headers to
visit me- so that I can build a system on the car. I have tested many
mufflers and have chosen one that does work. If you and or someone can come
to the New Brunswick, New Jersey area I will build a system, 100%T304SS, on
the car while you wait. I will discount the Fabspeed header back muffler
50% ($975 retail). I will even repair, as well as possible and restuff with
SS wool, your B&B Triflo muffler which you can try to resell through
Panorama and/or Excellence magazines. The whole process should be
accomplished in 2-3 hours. Fabspeed is open Saturdays too. Fabspeed has had
customers tow vehicles in from as far as Miami, Florida. Fabspeed is 1hr
south of NY City.
	Also, Fabspeed has header mufflers for 1989-1994 C2/C4 Carreras that have
been tested and proven. As soon as Larry Herman, F stock,  gets his
European racing headers/SSI type header system on his 1987 Carrera 3.2l;  I
will have the 1978- 1989 911SC and Carrera 3.2l cars covered with those
types of popular headers. However, these header flanges are 2 bolt versus
B&B's 3 bolt so each installation is custom. 
	Some one just needs to call me and come down with a B&B header equiped 3.2
Carrera. For example, Tim Rosengrant, NNJR 1991 C2 B&B headers and
splitopen B&B muffler and melted bumper cover, went home extremely happy
with a Fabspeed  hiperformance nonresonating durable muffler system. You or
someone can do the same.
