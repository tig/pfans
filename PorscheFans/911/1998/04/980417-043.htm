Kind folks:

Seeking some opinions on my 1988 3.2 Carrera with 25,000 miles:

Two weeks ago while driving the car,  I noticed under hard acceleration
what sounded like a rapid "hammering" noise at engine speeds of over 4,000
RPM. Not super loud, but definitely audible. Didn't seem to affect the
performance at all.

The next morning, the car made no such noise,  valves were quiet, all
seemed well. The night before I did find a wing nut loose in the engine
compartment, so wondered (hoped) if it was perhaps rattling around back
there.

Last night, after driving the car in a spirited fashion, upon returning
heard a "ticking" noise at idle, which I assume is garden variety valve
noise. Upon taking it by my mechanic, he recommended a valve adjustment. He
also happened to have another 3.2 in the shop which had some seriously loud
valve noise. Made me feel better ... sort of. But driving it back home, I
noticed the "hammering" seemed to be present again above 4,000 RPM.

It's the sudden appearance of the ticking and the intermittent noises that
make me wonder if an adjustment is the cure. The car's 30,000 mile service
(and valve adjustment) was done at 22,000 miles - 3,000 miles ago (although
that was more than 16 months ago).

I'm wondering if I might have some carbon hanging around, particularly
since I just put a  new DME chip in the car (this was after the first
episode of noise so I don't think it's related), and the mechanic had
warned of some possible slight detonation from carbon at first due to the
timing changes.

At his recommendation, I added a can of SeaFoam cleaner to a full tank of
gas (it's a marine/auto formula he swears by after a lot of testing), and
will drive a day or two to see what transpires.

The car does not use oil excessively, nor smoke at startup or high RPM. It
was driven very seldomly (3000 miles) by the PO in the last 5 years, but
oil was changed twice a year anyway. Otherwise it runs strong and healthy.
Any thoughts appreciated.

Vic
