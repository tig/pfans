Check out http://www.kindel.com/porsche/options.asp. It's an online option
code decoder I put online last year. 

Enjoy,

Subject: option codes 


Can anyone help me with these 2 option codes from a 1978 911SC Targa?  
They are #482 & #A53.  PCNA gave me the codes as options on my car when 
it was built.  However, they couldn't tell me what were the options.  I 
seem to have read somewhere that in '78 16" wheels were an option, I'm 
wondering if this is one.  Also the code for the interior was 09.  
Again, they didn't know about the particulars.  In Mark Haabs' 
authenticity series book that code would indicate that the car interior 
was black leatherette with leather inlays, leather side panels & black 
carpeting.  Are there any experts that could tell me otherwise?  Thanks 
in advance.
