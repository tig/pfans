I have about three ways I generally jack the rear of the car.  If you only
need to remove one rear wheel, I jack the car at the relatively small
spot of bodywork just below the point where the torsion bars exit.  I'll
also add that my floor jack has the standard "cup" on the end and I've
put a piece of 2x4 in the cup to mitigate damage to whatever I'm jacking.

If you need to get the whole car up on jack stands (did this last night), then
I jack the car at the factory jack point (since my car doesn't have any rockers
on it I just jack directly on the tubular steel jack point).  I have also jacked
the car (when the rockers were still on) just inside of the factory jacking
point on the floor pan.  I know some people are gasping and/or spinning
in their graves, but *my* floor pan is sound and I've done this for years
with no ill affects at all.  Another good option is to invest in one of those
aftermarket jacking plates that sticks in the steel tube at the factory
jack point and fits in the cup of your floor jack.

Some people jack the car by the engine, but I'm kind of leery of that.

Good luck,
