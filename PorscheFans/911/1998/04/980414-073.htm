Hi, All.  Have been reading this porsche list for some time trying to
learn all I can about Porsches.  I have been looking for one for about
five years and about a month ago found my dream car.  Its a Guards Red
1986 930.  I really prefer the 74-89 look over the newer models.  All
black leather interior, 32K miles, perfect condition, no leaks, no oil
usage(at least in 800 miles), runs like a top.  What a blast driving
this baby.  I consider myself lucky.  Just installed a new "aspen"
blaupunkt radio and a CD changer.  Put the changer under the passenger
seat.  This is the beginning of a complete upgrade of the radio system. 
Want to do the speakers next.  This leads me to my question.  What is a
really neat way to put some decent speakers in the rear.  Don't see much
room, but thought some of the experts out there has developed something
really good or has some good ideas.  Not going wild with the system, but
want the good sound I'm used to in my daily driver(Mark VIII)
.
