Brian,

I haven't done that job in a while, but if I remember correctly, the bolts
are not hex bolts, but 12 point star type bolts.  A hex socket will fit,
but will only be putting force on half the points and will strip much
easier.

I may be wrong on this as I can't remember for sure.  If so, someone please
correct me.  But, just in case, double check so you don't strip anymore.  I
know I have seen this before and I thought it was with those bolts.
