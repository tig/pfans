Greg,
Excellent car, pretty low miles, was it stagnant for a long time?
Anyways, there are not too many bolt on improvements that would make a =
noticable difference without altering your smog emmissions.  I am =
guessing that you live in California.  since I also live in CA, and have =
the exact same car, I have put a bit of thought into this myself.

There are lots of improvements that can be made including the following:

SoK Supercharger:  About $7000, but gives you around 300hp, definately =
not smog legal.

Increase displacement to 3.2 up to 3.5 Liters, well, you don't want to =
take you engine apart, but this can be done smog legally and give you up =
to 300+hp, be careful about maintaining suspension and brakes though, I =
know of a 3.5 liter conversion from a 3.0 SC motor that has wrecked both =
cars it was put in. primarily due to lack of driver skill and not enough =
brake power.(Personally, I am planning to go to 3.2 liters when I need a =
rebuild)

K&N air filter, don't know how much if any HP improvement, but Performance=
 has a sale for about $50 for an SC filter.

Exhaust:  Can be up to 15 hp, but I don't know that this is noticable, =
cost can be up to $1500 for a B&B.  the pre-74 heat exchanger can be =
adapted for your car, but this will not pass emmissions in CA, do not =
know about elsewhere.

Weber Carbs:  Don't recall the exact HP gain, but throttle response is =
greatly enhanced, making a big difference, not smog legal in CA.  Price =
varies, as weber does not make these anymore, as can be expected, prices =
are increasing, and that is IF you can even find them.

Personally, I understand the need for pure HP and the constant desire for =
more of it, however, the car certainly has plenty of power for my needs =
currently.   I plan on learning how to handle the car to its potential =
and improve suspension before I tweeek the motor.

Some suspension improvements that you can do  include :
(I know this wasn't part of you original question but...)
turbo tie rods:  Crisper handling, a few hundred dollar, and smog legal!

Delrin bushings: stiffer than the rubber ones, but may squeek a little, =
well maybe a lot in some cases.

I would caution against stiffining the suspension on a Targa too much, as =
i have heard of one popping the rear window after putting in a really =
stiff suspension.

Good Luck
