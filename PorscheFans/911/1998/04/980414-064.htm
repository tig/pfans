 What a joyful moment - I just took off my car jacket.  I am all excited for
my
 first full season of Porsche driving!  This joy is being tanted by the fact
 that I can NOT get two of the same answers for this question - What spark
 plugs should I put in?
 
 Porsche dealer - Bosch W3DPO
 Tweeks           - Bosch W3DPO
 Perf. Products  -Bosch WR5DP
 Local Shop#1   - Bosch W5DPO
 Local Shop#2   - Bosch W5DPO
 
 The car seemed to run fine when I bought the car last fall - but hey what do
I
 know, it is my first Porsche!  I pulled out Bosch W6DP (from the previous P
 owner).  The plugs were black.  I have no idea how long they were in there.
 Is it possible that with the "RIGHT" plugs, that the car will run even
better!
 
 Please help as I am at a standstill on this one.  I need to hear from some
 '72-'73 911T owners who know from first hand experience.
 
 Thanks,

Race Tuning for street or track:

The secret to engine reliabilty, is a correct air and fuel mixture at very
high engine RPM's. The " PLUG CUT " method is a way to view how your engine is
operating.

Most racers do this at the track when "dialing in" a new engine or a major
componet has been changed. The thing to remember is " LEAN is Mean " & "RICH
is reliable".

First consider that spark plugs vary in heat range. The hotter the plug the
leaner the engine will run. Conversley up to a point the cooler the plug the
richer the engine will
operate. Lets say your using NGK spark plugs they range from "5" which is
there hottest to "9" there coldest:
        1. To do the " PLUG CUT " install NGK # 7 ( or any other plug in the
middle of   
            the heat range )
        2. Take your car on the track and make 4 Laps.
        3. Then on your last lap, turn the engine off when going down the
straight-away
            coast into the pits and remove spark plugs. Inspect them for a
overly rich   
            condition ( blackness) or a overly lean condition ( grey or white
), " TAN " is
            the desired color of correct burning. Also bear in mind leaded gas
gives good  
            color readings and unleaded burns cleaner and gives less coloring.
The  
            things that alter the burn rate are.
            a. Change in spark plug range ( this has the smallest effect )
            b. Timming: more advance in timming the leaner the engine will
operate ( 
                middle effect in burn rate )
            c. Carb jetting: large jet holes richer burn rate. Webers and
Zeniths carbs    
                idle jets effect high speed mixture too ( unlike other types
of carbs 
                "MAXIMUM BURN RATE"

To do the same thing on the street, just find a stretch of road simular to a
race track
where the engine can be run hard. Then plan a pull off area. As you can see
this is a easy and low cost way to monitor your engine.
