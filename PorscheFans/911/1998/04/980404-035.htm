My 90 C4 started by idling at very low RPMs a couple of days ago.  Now, =
it is very hard to start it.  Whenever I let it sit for a couple of =
hours, it would start but as soon as I depress the gas pedal it dies. =
That continues to happen for a few more tries until it finally starts to =
act normal (normal driving but still idle at very low RPM).  I think I =
tried just letting it warm up for a minute or so without depressing the =
gas pedal and I was able to drive away without it dying on me.

What could be wrong now?

Also, where can I purchase a O2 sensor?

Thanks in advance.
Luis
