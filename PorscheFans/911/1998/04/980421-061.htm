Pfans,

I use a regular company for my '82 SC.  It costs about $800 for 7500
mi/year with a reasonable deductible etc. etc. (I live in a city that
isn't exactly well know for its low theft rate)  With this coverage I
can drive when and where I  want too.  I have not done any track events
yet, but will most likely get additional coverage when I do if my
company will not cover drivers ed.  From the several semi-negative posts
about Lealand-West they just do not seem to be something special.  My
point is, why the special company just for your Porsche?  Just use a
regular company and beat them up until you get a good rate.  I am sure
that the Porsche is not your only car if you drive less than 7k mi/yr so
threaten to take your $$ elsewhere.  Not only that, but most companies
do have programs for special cars, but they would rather you pay the
regular price };)  If you have a good record for many years you are an
insurance company's dream so use that to your advantage.  Power to the
Porsche fans!

Here is a snip from the archives about race insurance:

	I decided not to take the risk and have the potential headaches.
I
	checked
	out ways to get on-track insurance and this is what I found.

	PCA Club Racers and Driver Ed students can get full coverage
on-track
	damage protection from CRM Motorsports. Advertised in Panorama.
One of
	the attorneys for the cases I mentioned checked them out for me.
The
	insurance covers any damage to your car, regardless of fault,
during a
	PCA 
	Club Racing or Driver Education event. The rate is based on your
	personal 
	experience, days of track experience, number of incidences. You
can
	expect to
	pay a minimum of ~$1200 for a season or ~15-20 days.

	You pick the level of coverage you want, replacement value and
	deductible.
	The company is bonded by Loyds of London. I know a number of
	Northeast racers which have this coverage and used it last year
with
	no problems.

	This insurance does not cover you for street driving.

	For more information call Mike Retter at CRM Motorsports, 
	812-424-5578 x223.
	Tell him Cal sent ya.

	Have fun on the track, be it racing or drivers education!
