Hello P Fans.

I posted a few weeks ago a message explaining how disappointed I was =
with the understeering feature of my 90 C4 Cab.

Well, most replies suggested to make the front suspension harder (which =
is not a good solution considering the bad streets of Chicago) and =
getting wider tires in the front which would involve getting a new set =
of 4 rims and tires (costly). Some of the replies suggested that =
slightly depressing the brake pedal while turning would reduce the =
problem.

I found out that this car has a G sensor that senses when the car is =
turning hard.  When the G sensor detects high enough Gs, the AWD =
computer locks the front differential which causes the front tires to =
turn at identical speed. When a car turns, the tires normally rotate at =
different speeds, if they were to rotate at identical speed, they would =
actually be force to slip which causes a lose the grip to the pavement =
therefore causing the car to understeer.

Now, if you depress the brakes, the computer is forced to keep the =
differential unlocked so that the anti lock brake system can perform its =
function.  I found that the same wire that sends +12 V to the brake =
light when the brake pedal is depress, also sends +12 V to the AWD =
computer.  I isolated the wire that goes to the computer using a Diode =
so that it continues to sense when the brake pedal is depress and yet =
allow me to send +12 V to the AWD computer without the brake lights =
turning on.

I then installed a switch that allows me to switch my car to 2 WD (sort =
of like a C2) and to AWD (C4)  The understeering problem is gone =
whenever it is switch to 2 WD and if it rains or snows I can always =
switch to AWD

Can there be any damage to any of the differential components by keeping =
it in 2 WD permanently?

I'll be interested in hearing any comments from the experts.

Luis
