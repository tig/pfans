I'm planing to buy another 911 and am concerned about problems with certain 
years.
My first choice is an '87-'89 coupe, but a nice original low mile car is
hard to find. My second choice is a '90-'92 C2, but I've heard horror stories
about oil leaks. One independent dealor said that there is a 
call back for heads leaking on the early C2, but my Porsche dealor said that 
there is no call back and that all 911's leak! (I know that 3.2L engines have
very little oil problems); it's the 3.6's I'm unsure about.

Advice? Anyone know of a nice sunroof coupe for sale? I'm in NC.

Thanks for any response; please respond to strcklnd@aur.alcatel.com
