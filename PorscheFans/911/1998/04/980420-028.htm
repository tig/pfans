Hi PFans,

I spent some time playing with the cool new websearch engine (and I must
not be the only one 'cuz the hit counter keeps getting higher & the
responses keep getting slower) but am still seeking advice.

About a month ago I bought a 78 SC, my first, lots of miles (170K) but
recent engine rebuild.  I was planning on waiting a few more years &
getting something newer but the price was right so I jumped on in.  No
regrets :-)

The trans has the following symptoms, which predictably waited until
last week to show up...

1.  Kind of hard to shift into first when moving, but not a big problem.

2.  1->2 or 3->2 shifts can be (but aren't always) difficult, it never
grinds but sometimes you have to tug pretty hard.  (Occasionally I end
up holding the shift knob :-)  )  It seems to be worst when things
aren't yet warmed up.  This seems to be gradually getting worse, though
it could be that I'm just shifting at higher rpms now that i'm less
afraid :-)

3.  Occasionally on a shift out of 3rd the transmission pops out of
gear.  It never happens by itself.

4.  ... and a quiet (but I keep noticing it) high-pitched whine in 5th
which comes and goes.

As I have no real experience with auto repair (yet) I don't think I want
to start with a transmission rebuild (new heater cables first, maybe) so
I would be looking at having the work done.  My impression is that this
means I'll be spending $500-$1000 for a rebuild?  Or could (should) I
get away with just some new synchros?  

Having only driven cars whose transmissions have less "character"
(golfs, 944s), I also don't really know how worried I should be. 

I'm interested in a little advice before I go walking into a shop with
my wallet out.  Having once replaced my Golf transmission because i let
it go on acting weird for too long, I don't want to blow this off.  

Thanks in advance,
Scott
