Hi Denny and Pfans

*I GOT IT WORKING*

ahem...

Finally figured it out.  I will post the "how to guide" once I finish the
docs.  The trick for me was that my wiring is the complete opposite of
anything BW documented.

It's interesting that you had trouble with BW.  I spoke to Brad, and despite
the fact that he had a sore throat, he talked endlessly, and also told me to
call back if I had any more questions.  He didn't really "solve" the riddle,
but gave me more information as to the output of the wires.

As far as solving this for you, I would recommend going to a local Radio
Shack and buying the 4.99 "bag 'o gators" assortment.  This enabled me to do
"what-if" analysis on the wires easily, without painful twisting or
crimping.

-I will post my wiring schematic over the next day or so - Gotta Run!

-David
