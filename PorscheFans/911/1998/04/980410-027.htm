Hi P-Fans-
Thanks for the input, I've solved several vexing problems.  I wanted to
share the solutions for your benefit.

Regarding my 1990 C4:
1) The Interlock Warning Lamp would light along with the Central Warning
Lamp "!" and Central =

Warning Buzzer (LOUD).  Sometimes the ABS Warning Light would also come o=
n.
 These indicators =

would come on only when I had driven the car for several hours at highway=

speed.  Sometimes they would =

come on only once.  Other times, they would come on every 10 miles.  The
solution was to replace the two =

ignition wires that run from the ignition coils to the distributors and t=
o
slide the ground strap that runs =

along the left engine deck lid hinge 180 degrees so that it couldn't rub =
on
the ignition wires, thus causing =

them to ground.

2) My car developed a rough cold start idle where it would hunt from 800 =
to
1300 RPM.  This was cured =

by replacing a spark plug wire (between distributor and spark plug).  My
wrench said that the pin hole in =

the wire was causing an electrical disturbance in the system.  Hard to
believe this was the problem, but it =

fixed it.  Wrench located bad wire by pulling on off at a time until
problem stopped.

Console Interlock Engaged Light Question for 964 C4 owners:
In front of the front seats there is a console with a switch that will
manually lock the interlock.  By the =

switch is a yellow indicator lamp to show when the interlock is locked.  =
My
lamp flickers when I hit large =

bumps or expansion joints.  I have checked the electrical connection on t=
he
back of the switch and it looks =

sound.  DO ANY OF YOU EXPERIENCE THIS ALSO?  The light stays lit for only=

0.5 seconds and I do =

not hear any mechanical noise from the interlock.  Sure would appreciate
your help.
