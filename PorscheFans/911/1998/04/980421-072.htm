 The '72 I recently bought was autoX'd by a PO.  This guy was pretty serious
 about it and apparently was 1st in his region in 1983.  He wrote up a
 little care and feeding note when he sold the car...with alignment specs,
etc.
 
 Front:  camber 1 degree 10 minutes, castor 6.5 degrees, toe-in 10 minutes
 each side. <<

Toe in is not a good idea for autox, I've found zero works best
although most people like toe-out.

>> Rear:  camber 1 degree 30 minutes, toe-in 15 minutes each side.
 
 This car already has Konis on it too.  Front are set 1 turn up from full
 soft, rear just a hair down from full hard.
 
 The sway bars he used have been removed.  The car has no front bar on it
 any more, but it does have a rear bar.  And it's been lowered pretty
 far...not sure how much, though.  There's little to no gap between the tire
 and the fender.
 
 I plan on taking it out for it's first AutoX this weekend. <<

That should be fun with no front bar (not). You might
want to disconnect the rear if it oversteers too much.

>> I'm not sure
 how close the alignment is to the spec above...but I'll let you know how it
 goes.  This'll be tough considering this is my first 911 and I've only had
 roughly 2 days behind the wheel since I bought it.  Time to look stupid!! <<

Good luck!
