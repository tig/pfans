Ahh, did this last night on my '76!  On my '76, both the fill and the drain
plugs are big 19mm nuts.  You've found the drain plug (at the low point
of the gearbox just below the ring gear).  The fill plug (remember, it
looks just like the drain plug) is on the driver's side of the case about
2/3s or so up from the bottom and 6 or 8 inches forward of where the
drain plug is located.

As for which oil to use, I've been using Mobil1 synthetic, but am going to
try Swepco this time and see what happens.  IMHO, though, any good,
name-brand gear oil that meets the GL-5 spec should be just fine.
