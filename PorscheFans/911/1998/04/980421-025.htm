Peter, 

After reading your message it was plain to see you have or had the same 
problem as i have had on my '80 SC.  The problem is simple, your 
alternator is not producing enough power under load.  Have it load tested 
you'll probably have to have it rebuilt or get a new one.
 
I had the same problems in the past, tach not reading, gauges out, and 
the car still starts ok in the morning and runs fine.  

After i had my alternator fixed the car ran better and started quicker in 
the morning.  Although at idle speed and under a full load the tach will 
still jump around like a bouncing ball but one blip of the gas and it 
smartens up.  This ofcourse is still not good.  Can anybody spread a 
little insight my way?  Do i still have problems with my alternator?  My 
mechanic says is charges perfect.....except at idle under a full load, 
then it steals from the battery instead of charging it.  Is this a 
typical problem?  Do i just live with low voltage at idle?  

kvp.
