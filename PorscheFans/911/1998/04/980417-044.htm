I have heard this space called the "package shelf." I am unsure of the
configuration on an early car. On the '86 and '83 I have had you need to
remove four screws on the vertical panel behind the folding seat backs. The
vertical panel and the shelf are really one piece. You then lift up on this
vertical part until a tang disengages (you have to lift it about an inch).
The assembly then pulls out. Check it out, your '68 may be similar.

Subject: The flat space below rear window


For a start what is the flat space below rear window called? My question
is how do I remove this? The leather covering on this space is slowly
slipping loose, like shrinking, I want to remove this thing and have the
leather refitted but I have no idea how. I tried removing the two little
brackets but this didn't work, anyway what are these things for? I would
appreciate some help.

Thanks
