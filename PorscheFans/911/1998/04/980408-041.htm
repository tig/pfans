Eric,

I have used RE71s on early 911s (66 and 72) for both street and track. 
Liked them very much - they gave up a bit in ultimate traction at the
track, but were a ton better in the rain than 008s.  Reasonable wear on
the street, too.  Good prices at Tire Rack; I used to get them from
Leitzinger Motorsports in College Station, PA, but don't know if that's
possible anymore.

My sizes were 205/50/15 on the 66 and 205/225/50/15 on the 72.
