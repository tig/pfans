Nathan - the tranny fill plug is on the left side about midway toward the
front from the axles, and about half way up.  Sort of above the
accellerator rod bell crank, which will get in your way a bit.  Should take
a 19mm socket.   Or an Allen plug, but my '77 had a bolt head (if that is a
suitable term) plug, not an Allen internal wrenching plug, and so have all
my other 915s (pre SC I think).   Usually screwed in pretty tight.  Fill with
fluid until it starts running back out, put plug back in, wipe up mess.  

Buy a transmission oil pump from an auto parts store - inexpensive little
plastic pump you stick into your oil bottle and pump into a tube which you
can stick in the fill hole.  You could put a funnel into a long tube, remove
left rear wheel, and slowly pour oil in that way.  Pump is better deal.

This is not an easy job like adding oil to the engine.  Doable, though.

You might consider draining the tranny first, and filling it with new oil. 
Maybe you don't know how long that oil has been in there, plus those
noises you hear aren't doing the oil generally any good.  It's a splash oil
system, and if you've been creating metal shavings it helps to get them
out of there.  The drain plug should have a magnet in it, so you can clean
that and get rid of the metal shavings that stick there.

Follow Eric Brown's Rule #1, though.  It sounds like the voice of
unwanted experience.
