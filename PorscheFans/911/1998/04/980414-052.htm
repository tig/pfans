Fans,

I was all set to go autocrossing this Sunday, woke up at 6:45 to get ready
and heard the rain just POUNDING down :^(. I elected to simply roll over
and go back to sleep. Was that the right choice? Dunno. I've got no problem
going to a track event in the rain, but I didn't think an autocross would be
as much fun.

There - that was the P-content... the real reason for the note is to see
if the # of list subscribers is still really low... if so, I may send out
another of my "spam" messages to past subscribers to let 'em know...

Cheers!

Ross
