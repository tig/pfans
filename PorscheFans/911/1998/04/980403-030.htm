The drain plug is maybe a third of the way up the side of the trans. It is
the same type of plug as the drain, meaning you need a giant allen wrench.
The VW parts places sell a socket that will work nicely with your 3/8" drive
tools (the hex recess is the same on p-cars and VWs). Important rule #1:
remove the filler plug first. If you first remove the drain plug and then
discover that the filler plug is stuck, well you have a problem.

I like Swepco 201 gear oil. Here in Seattle I can get it at the Porsche
dealer and at various parts houses.

Subject: Transmission oil filler location


Hi guys,

I have a '76 911 and I'm trying to do my own maintenance, etc.  Recently
the sound of the gears in the transmission have increased in such a way
that leads me to think that maybe it doesn't have enough oil.  It just
seems to sound like gears meshing and turning each other without
adequate lubrication.

First, where do I fill the transmission oil from?  I've got the Haynes
manual, but I can only find reference to the drain plug, they don't
mention where to fill!  Second, I've read discussions on the list lately
that lead me to beleive that "Lubro-Moly" transmission oil is the best
out right now?  Can anyone tell me where to get it, and what to ask for?

Any responses appreciated.

Thanks,
Nathan Fornwalt
