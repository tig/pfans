Paul's on to something here -

I think we all have a *favorite* supplier - that is, one that hasn't
pissed us off yet...  mine is Vertex, although I still order from
Automotion and others, I like the prices from Vertex, and being
in Florida, I get overnite service at UPS ground prices...:-)

I can understand how a single bad experience could turn us 
away from a vendor - my bad experience is Performance, 
and yes, now I've blacklisted them, perhaps unfairly, but-hey,
they had their chance, just as I'm sure Vertex has lost customers
thru bad customer relations...

We all have to remember that the popularity of the 911's mean that
we are lucky to have such an abundant supply of parts and stuff
available from lots of vendors - some fancy, some gut-bucket cheap...

Oh well, hope this helps... my mini-point is, not to just always
order from one vendor - give them all some business sometimes...?
