Tim,

I have an '87 which is mechanically very similar.  I've had 2
starting problems with mine.  First, I had a bad O2 and/or
Cold start sensor which was effectively saying "Feed Me".
It resulted in severe flooding and therefore if I missed the
first spark, the engine just drowned itself.  Since you say
you don't smell fuel, I would say this is not your case.

Second, and a likely candidate for you, my DME relay failed.
The effect was an open circuit and zero voltage to the fuel
pump.  Therefore, although I cranked just fine, no fuel means
no fire and no start.  My temporary fix to get home was to
open the fuse panel in the luggage compartment, and re-route
the power for the electric windows to the fuel pump fuse.

So, if you want to check this, turn on the ignition, and
check the voltage at the fuel pump fuse.  If the DME relay
is bad, it's located under the driver's seat by the DME
control unit.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne Michelsen

Well it looked like today was going to be a great day (Friday and all)
until I got in the car (84 911), which ran fine last night but wouldn't
start this morning. Being relatively new to 911s could someone please
provide a list of thing to check given this situation. It turns over nicely
but won't catch. I didn't smell any gas which is a bit surprising given all
the cranking I did (I just couldn't believe the @#$%^ thing wouldn't start)
and yes there is gas in the tank. I didn't have time to check for spark
which is the first thing on my list but I would like to know things to
check that are particular to 911s. BTW I want to shoot this problem
tomorrow (Sat)so please E-Mail me direct because I'm a digest subscriber.
Thanks.
