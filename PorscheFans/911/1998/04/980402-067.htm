Hi all,

I have a 1979 930 with 60K miles on the clock. I went to my local Mobil
shop today to buy some Mobil 1, I noticed that it was rated at 5W / 50.
Is that right ?? The cost of the Mobil 1 was $47 for 5 liters. I spoke
to my Porsche wrench and he told me that I could use Mobil SynthS which
is synthetic also but only costs $27 for 5 liters and is rated at
15W / 50. I am at a loss as to what type(brand) and what rating, engine
oil I should be using.

One more thing can someone educate me or point me in the 
right direction as to what all the ratings mean in
the oils. i.e. 5W/50 as opposed to 15W/50

Thanks
