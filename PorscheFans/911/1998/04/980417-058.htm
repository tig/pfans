Jad,
Thanks for the response but I dont think my lines are bad.  What I didnt say
in my post (sacrified too much clarity for bandwidth) was that I'm in the
process of replacing lines, MC and rebuidling rear calipers so I know the
lines are OK and I havent yet put fluid in the system.

This problem has me stumped so any ideas are welcome.  Actually, I've so
little experience with brakes that I dont know which caliper is bad....maybe
neither.  All I know for sure is that the left pistons stay in fine but the
rights dont.

Thanks,
Joe
