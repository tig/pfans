I just wanted to thank everyone for their suggestions on my high
idle problem.  The shop I took it to has looked at it and diagnosed what
they think the problem is.  Along with the high idle, I was also hearing
an unusual sound from behind the fan.  I thought this was either
valves out of adjustment or collapsed pressure-fed tensioners, but
I had never heard these problems in person.

As it turns out, the tensioners have collapsed.  I installed these myself
about 5000 miles ago.  Luckily, the chain has not skipped a tooth and
no other damage has been done.  One was completely collapsed and the other
was "softer than it should be" (mechanic's description).

So my next question: how did this happen ?  These things are supposed to
be bulletproof.  I bought the kit from a recommended (and nameless, for
now) mail order vendor.  They were supposed to be Porsche original parts.
Is it possible that I got knock-offs ?

Can I get this vendor to refund me for the bad parts ?  If so, can I also
get some kind of compensation for what I've had to pay my mechanic ?
Even though it has only been 5000 miles, it has been quite a few months
since I bought them.  

Hypothetical question: if these faulty tensioners had caused my engine
to rip itself apart, would the vendor have been liable for that ?

Thanks for any insite.
