I've only driven my '87 with Repco Metal Master pads.  Can anybody tell me
how these pads compare to OEM pads or Performance Friction 80 compound
pads.  The car is primarily street driven, with some drivers ed, and has
the cool-brake ducting kit.  Option 1 is use the same pads for street and
drivers ed.  Option two is one set of pads for street and one set for
drivers ed.   Areas of interest are:
1. how dirty are they? (bad for street, ok if track only)
     The Metal Masters are acceptable (wheel slightly dirty after a few
days, filthy after two weeks)
2. how hard are they on rotors (alway a negative in my book)
     I don't have a valid reference for the Metal Masters.
3. how quickly do they come up to temp on the street?
     The Metal Masters are o.k. (good enough that I thought they were OEM
until I found out otherwise.)
4. how resistant to fade are they on the track?
     I didn't push it on the track because I didn't have the cool kit then
and they felt like they were getting ready to fade.
