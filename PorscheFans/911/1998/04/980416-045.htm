Actual List-relevant content alert!

But first, this word from friendly neighborhood Unka Bart.

Funny how words lead into unrelated flash-backs...  Years ago, when yer
kindly ol' Unka Bart was a stoont at Col. Thayer's Finishing and Reform
School for Boys on the Hudson, I had a room mate who was studying Rooshin.
The Rooshin word for "Key" turns out to be "Klutch", and the word for "New"
in that tongue is "Novwi" (Taking Phonetic license here).

When asked by his instructor to use the new word for "key" in a sentence
(in Roosky), said roomie responded straightfacedly: "A man who loses the
<klutch> to his ladies appartment is apt not to get any <Novwi Klutch>.

The Instructor, a kindly ol' Russian gent, never did understand why the
roomful of uniformed hooligans in his care broke into laughter...

Maybe you had to be there, but I digress.  Carerras (maybe others, quien
sabe?) have a coiled flat spring (like a bar, turned edgewise and coiled
into a circle) that "helps" release the clutch.  This breaks.  Clutch
effort goes up by a factor of 3 or 4.  No biggie.  Replace the spring if
it's important to you, but the clutch works fine without it.

Me? Mine ('86 cab) went south miles ago, and frankly I don't care.

But on the other hand, that just might be the little green jobbies doin'
their collective thing...
