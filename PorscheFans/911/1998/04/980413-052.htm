I have a recollection of seeing several 911s and 914s setup with a misting system at a DE event about ten years ago.

I remember seeing puddles of water under the cars as they waited to go on the track.  Once up to speed I don't believe that any water accumulated on  the track.  I think they were using  windshield washer reservoirs and pumps.  There were no fancy nozzles to generate a fine mist.  It was an open tube right by the fan.  A switch in the car turned the pump on and off.  I think they emptied the tank in a 20 minute session.

As I recall, the reason given for its use was that the very dry air in Denver inhibited heat transfer from the cylinder to the air flowing across it.  By increasing the humidity of the air, the thermal resistance was lowered and the engine would run cooler.  Any mechanical engineers out there with additional insights?

This approach does overlook the fact that our cars are basically oil cooled.  Would it be more effective to put mist through the oil cooler?
