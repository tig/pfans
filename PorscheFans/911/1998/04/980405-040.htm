When I purchased my 80 911SC, the O2 sensor was also disconnected =
leading me to do some further investigation.  Here's a brief synopsis of =
what I found:
The O2 sensor itself is designed to measure the amount of unburned =
oxygen in the exhaust flow before it enters the catalytic converter.  =
This measurement can be used, in turn, to optimize the fuel air ratio.  =
The sensor itself will provide nominally between 200 and 700 mV when it =
has been heated to operating temperature (higher voltages indicate =
leaner conditions).  This voltage is then sent to the electronic control =
unit (ECU) which resides under the passenger seat.  The ECU is then =
responsible for providing a variable duty cycle signal to the frequency =
valve which ultimately increases or decreases the flow of fuel to the =
injectors.  If the ECU does not receive a signal from the O2 sensor, the =
system defaults to full rich.  Note that the whole system's ability to =
modulate the mixture is minimal and not enough to cause a dangerously =
lean condition (or so I'm told). =20
Why I recommend you should reconnect the sensor (provided it still =
functioning properly):=20
1) Better fuel economy (10-15%)
2) Less sooting of plugs etc. by overly rich mixtures
3) Longer catalytic converter life ($$)
4) Better for the environment
If your sensor is old and needs replacement, there are many aftermarket =
sensors available which cost far less than the OEM part if money is a =
big concern.

Hope this helps!
