Greetings Fans,
Please help. I just purchased a used twin ignition for my 930. It is allegedly
for a 91 model. This is one of the non-Motronic designs. It uses the 12 wire
$$ caps and rotors and is made by modifying an existing distributor.  It has
the following numbers on it:  #PGFUDG,  the original number appears to be #
0237.301.003, its been restamped # 0 237 302 004.  It has 2  Permatune CD
boxes with built in coils. It has  NO vacum pot on it..?  I have a fresh 3.4
ltr with all the good stuff that I would ever want on a 930 engine. We removed
the old dual plug setup for a variety of reasons -(inferior design and
durability). I have been quite happy with the stock Euro single plug setup but
wanted to return to twin plugs for high boost safety margin. I planned to
someday have Anidal build a similar system to this one. They are
(understandably) uninterested in helping people with information on their used
parts so I am hoping that some of you can tell me.... This car is set up for
being a comfortable street rocket with occasional track use.

Suggestions?  What - exactly is this system??  I don't understand what a
street system would be doing without a vaccum pot and believe that I should
install one. Can anyone recommend a specific pot? Single pot or dual pot (I
think that the dual pot might be superior but???).  What about timing? Initial
and total advance? Might anyone have a set of installation instructions for
one of these? Any other advice? My mechanic happens to be my brother. He is
always interested in helping me increase performance but has to make a living
and has little time to chase around for this information. 

(If this is fruitful I have a another question that I wish to ask -but that is
a very different subject and completely different can of worms-but I believe
that some of you will find it very interesting....) Any help appreciated.
Godspeed, John Rice
