The original mail must have truncated the last 7 codes:

9) I will always yield right of way for rutting moose.

10) If it could help stop the war in Baghdad, I will gladly donate my exotic
car to the government.  I'll pay for shipping, even.  Yah, right.

11) To impress young girls, I will do burn outs in front of their school
during
lunch hour on a warm spring day.  I will donate my cel phone number on
little pieces of paper.

12) I will sand all rust spots BEFORE I spray paint them.

13) When young kids walk up in awe and try to look inside or at the car,
I will tell them "don't come near it, it has an alarm".

14) I won't let my cousin/sister/brother/uncle/aunt/father/mother/girlfriend
drive
it, but I'll think nothing of letting some unknown highschool drop-out valet
park
it for me.

15) Every time I see another exotic car like mine, I will plaster a "this
car is
really a Fiero" sticker on it.


***NOTICE:  Please do not take the above too seriously.  It's a joke
dammit.***
