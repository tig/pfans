Eric Purdy wrote an informative reply to the question of O2 sensor 
function. I did spot one error, though, that would send a person on the 
wrong track if using O2 sensor output to diagnose a problem. Be aware 
that sensor output voltage increases with richness of the mixture - thus 
sensor output is inverse to O2 content in the exhaust gases. Yes, this 
seems counter-intuitive for something called an "oxygen sensor", but this 
is confirmed in Probst's book on Bosch fuel injection and in my Saab 900 
manual. Think of sensor output as proportional to mixture richness. 

You need a digital voltmeter to read sensor output and diagnose its 
function. Also, remember that the sensor has to be at about 600 degF to 
operate properly, so warm up the engine fully before trying to check 
sensor output. If you've got a three-wire hookup to the sensor, the black 
wire contains the output voltage. The other two (typically white) run 12V 
and ground to the heating coil that's integral to the sensor to provide 
fast warm-up.

For all the reasons Eric provided, you're well advised to get the system 
running. The O2 sensor gets tired or fails some time in the 20-40K mile 
range, so be prepared to replace it.
