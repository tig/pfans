For my curiosity, how did you deal with the CV issue?  What I am
particularly interested in is what fly there might be in the ointment I have
thought might work:  keep your old CV on the wheel side, and just use a
later CV on the tranny side.  What I don't know is whether there was a
change in splines (number of splines) between the early CV d 911s and
later ones, or between the 4 bolt and 6 bolt CV s.  I've got a late axle
whose splines I could count (recount, actually), but not an early axle,
and am not a full fledged axeologist.

Somehow swapping out the outter wheel flanges seems more than
ought to be needed.

Walt Fricke - idly curious

Oh, yes - you had a further problem.  My race car (a roller when I got it)
was set up for the 901 tranny (the axles had Spicer U joints - I had 6 bolt
plates welded to these to mate with the 915 before I got aluminum
bananas and junked the U joints for regular CV s).  I purchased a 915
shift tower (as you did).  Nice that it just bolted into place in the existing
bolt holes and captured nuts inside the shift tunnel.  I had not a lick of real
trouble with this, so I don't think there is any inherent incompatibility
issue.

When you have the shifter installed but NOT attached via the coupler to
the tranny back in the access hole, does the shifter move like it should? 
and the coupler rotates and moves back and forth?  If so, then you have
no special problem with the shifter, I'd guess.  If not, something pretty
basic (although I can't think what) is out of whack up front.  Inspection of
where the shift tube and its ball cup are in relation to their surroundings,
and how the shift tube guide bushing and bracket fit into the geometry of
all this ought to reveal where this is happening, and suggest a solution to
you.

Assuming shifter works fine until attached to tranny, what you describe
sounds more like a tranny which won't shift, rather than a shifter which
won't work.  What's the tranny's history?  You should be able to shift the
tranny with the coupler not attached. 

 Is the tranny in neutral (which is the best place to start, I think, for
adjusting the coupler)?  This is the only position in which the shift rod
from the tranny will move in rotation.  If it won't rotate (not much, maybe
1/8 to 1/16th of a turn if that is all it takes to select all 3 positions), it is not
in neutral.  

However, you should be able to push it out of 2/4/R into neutral by
pushing back on the end of the rod if it is in one of those gears.  If it is in
neutral, you should be able to push it back into 1/3/5.  And with a little
help from an ice pick or something stuck into the lock screw hole on the
shift rod, you can coax the rod forward to get it out of 1/3/5, or into
2/4/R.  You probably won't be able to do this shifting with just your
fingers, but a little leverage prying with something ought to do it.  Ditto
with trying to move the rod forward.  

Unless you can identify which set of gears you are in, don't pry too hard
- if you are already in a gear you don't want to push super hard in the
same direction lest you maybe bend something, like a shift fork.  Think of
what a good pop with the palm of your hand on the end of the rod with
the tranny out of the car would amount to.  That is about all it should take,
I think.  You won't be able to pull in the forward direction hard enough to
do damage.

If the shift rod isn't in neutral and won't move back or forth period, you've
at least identified where the problem is.  It is in the tranny.

without having to get to the hard parts - anything deeper than second
gear.)
