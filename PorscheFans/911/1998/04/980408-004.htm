Hi All,
I found a few things wrong on my 1987 911 Coupe
today and need some help/advice.

Issue 1:  Noticed the blower motor above my
forward A/C
condenser (in the trunk by the spare
tire) wasn't running.  I found that the motor was
disconnected.  When I reconnected the power and
turned on the system, the electric motor smoke
checked itself.  I took apart the housing to find
that the motor was frozen, and by the looks of it,
that is why the previous owner disconnected it.
When I started to check around for the motor I
found that the dealer will only sell the entire
unit (motor & housing).  I would like to go with a
new Bosch motor if I could find one.

Any Ideas of were to find:  Bosch part #
0130007081

Issue 2.  I also found a plastic hose that runs
along the driver side in the trunk (by the window
washing hose) that exits the car down by the
battery.  The top portion is connected to a vacuum
hose that looks like it broke off of a plastic
fitting.  I do not  have head light washers on my
car.  What is this mystery hose and what was it
connected to.

Issue 3.  I just replaced my cruise control brain
with a used one.  The one I bought the car with
would never hold speed.  Went for a test drive and
the car would hold speed very well, but it was not
smooth.  The throttle seemed to either be engaged
or coasting.  I check this on a flat surface.  It
was better around 75mph.  Is this normal or am I
being too critical.

Thanks,
Dennie G. Bourbeau
