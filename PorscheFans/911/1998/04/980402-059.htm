I studied this in one of my humah factors & biomechanics courses at RIT..
instruments in  aircraft cockpits and on military ships are all red, as red
light has the least impact on the dialation of the pupils..  if you are
flying a plane at night and your instermentation is rather bright your
pupils will contract, letting less light from other things in your field of
view ( the dark windshield in front of you)  into your eyes.. i use the
same idea in my car... i always use the instermentation lighting at a
minimal setting when driving in desolate night areas...
