I recently had a bad experience with Vertex as well.  I have ordered from
them before without any problems, but not this time.

When I was replacing my pedal bushings, I noticed a crack all the way
through one side of the clutch shaft, where the locking pin goes through. 
So I wanted to replace the shaft (obviously).

I called Vertex, they said they had used shafts with new bronze bushings
pressed in and that they were $60.  So I said ok, I'd like to order.  It
was so noisy in the office at their end the salesperson had to ask me to
repeat everything many times before he could hear me.  He asked the people
to be quiet several times with no change.

I told the salesperson that it was imperitive that I have this part by the
weekend (it was Monday) so I could install it and have time to test & make
adjustments for a DE event.  He said the part was in stock, would ship that
day, and assured me I would have it.

The next day, I called to confirm shipment.  The person said the part
hadn't shipped yet.  I asked when it would ship, he said "soon".  I waited
two more hours, then called back, same story.  I started to get worried. 
The salesman then said "let me see if we have that in stock".  WHAT?  I
thought it WAS in stock!  He also said they still had other peoples' orders
from the previous week that were higher priority than mine.  He told me he
would call me when it shipped.

In the mean time, I called Parts Heaven.  They had the entire pedal
assembly for only $50.  I told them I needed it by the weekend.  "No
problem".  I got 3 day shipping.  It actually only took 2 days.

I called Vertex to cancel my order.  They said "yea, whatever, bye".  Two
hours later, Vertex calls to tell me my order is shipping.  I told them I
had already cancelled.  What a joke.

BTW, Vertex wanted $25 shipping and handling (for UPS ground) for just the
shaft.  Parts Heaven 3 day aired the whole assembly for $12.  I guess
Vertex must do a lot of "handling" as opposed to "shipping" for the extra
$13.

Needless to say, I will not be ordering from Vertex anymore.  Just my
experience with them.  I'm sure they have many satisfied customers, but not
me.
