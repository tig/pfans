Of course my opinion is biased. I want a car that does not understeer
grossly. Since the 964 C4 does indeed do that, I am biased against it. I
am pretty sure I have made this bias clear all along. This bias does not
invalidate my position since the bias is based on what the car actually
does. I am not biased against it because it is a Porsche. The technical
data is on my side. So is the real world handling characteristics. This
whole thread was in response to some person that wanted to know the
differences of the C2 versus C4 and how that would affect driving which
might include some autocrossing. 

I did not say the 964 C4 AWD system was not advanced. I did not say it
did not work as designed. It is a very trick mechanical system that works
amazingly well.

If a person wants a Porsche that understeers more so than normal (because
they all understeer from the factory) then the C4 is for them. If you live
where an AWD is advantageous more often than not, then a C4 is for you. If
you want traditional 911 handling, the C2 is the way to go.

Sorry dude, but the 964 C4 is NEVER a neutral car unless you change the
suspension. Even if you do that, it will still understeer coming out of
slow corners.

The viscous coupling system in the 993 C4 uses about 50% less power
(Source: "Porsche 911 Story" by Paul Frere).

Have not read the information there. I got my information from the
aforementioned "Porsche 911 Story" and "Porsche 911" by Tobias Aichele.
Both books were put together with full access to factory personnel and
documentation.

Frere's books mentions quite plainly that the 964 C4 understeered severely
and one of the goals of the 993 C4 system was to fix that. That did that.
The 993 C4 understeers only slight more so than the 993 C2.
