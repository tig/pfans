Pfans,

My 89 Speedster is about to have long periods (sigh!) 1-3 month stretches without use,  I have been told by my dealer that a battery saver which trickle feeds (1amp) the battery will help keep the battery in good shape, has anyone out there had any experience with these devices?, any advice greatly appreciated on this or any other suggestions as to make sure my pride and joy is kept in tip top shape for my brief home stays. 

My apologias in advance to those more experienced posters who will find this type of newbie question irritating, please let me know if this type of posting is not appropriate in the group and I shall desist.

Regards
