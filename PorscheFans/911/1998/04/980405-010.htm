I noticed in several prior Porsches that the seat wouldn't move far enough
forward to allow a 'straight shot' with an allen wrench. And torquing from
an angle increases the likelihood of stripping the head.

I had Automotion find a set of high quality metric ball-head allan wrenches
that will allow you to reach allen head screws at up to a 10 degree angle,
safely.

Part # TL-905 is A 9-piece set that includes the 6mm wrench you will need
for seat removal. Price is $19.98.
(Automotion is my client)
