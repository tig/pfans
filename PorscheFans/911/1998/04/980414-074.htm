I had a similar problem with a heavy clutch. It turned out to be the
clutch cable. It had frayed and was binding inside of its sheath. I
found this out after having the clutch replaced without the problem
being solved. So I would check the clutch cable before going after the
clutch. The cable is cheap and easy to replace.

I also have problems with with  first and second gear. Things were
better after replacing the clutch and cable, but  not great. I'm going
to try the Swepco 201 gear oil to see if that helps. At some point I'll
have to replace the synchro's. I'm considering trying the job myself.
