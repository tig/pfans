Am looking for the link to Dave Buhain's website to review valve
adjustment procedure...used to be www.msroadrace.com, but that link
doesn't want to work now.

Or maybe there's a more current site/description for valve adjustment?

Chip, 
Here is some info I have archived. Hope it helps.

Subject: Valve Adjustment Methodology

Okay Folks,
My 'good deed' for the day is to divulge my personal experience in valve
adjustments for a 911.  I have a 1987 coupe and had undertaken the task this
past February with the help of all of the good folk on this list and the
Haynes manual, along with a little self produced inspiration to 'know the job
had been done right'.  I would  recommend that anyone with an interest and
mechanical inclination attempt to do this on their 911, it's not very
difficult and very redundant (once you've done one, you basically know how to
do the rest).  The cost savings are great, and the most rewarding is the self
satisfaction of accomplishing the job.

To adjust the valves, it would be ideal to have the car raised off the ground
or on blocks for easier access to the lower exhaust banks.  Drain the oil
completely (that is the tank and the crank, this is a good time to change the
oil anyway).
Parts to be removed:

A/C compressor, loosen the adjuster bolt/nut remove the belt and remove the 4
bolts holding down the A/C unit to the base.  Use a large blanket or comforter
and wrap the compressor in it and gently swing it over onto the right side
fender (try not to bend the lines to much).

Air Cleaner Box, this just unbolts from the throttle body unit on the inside
of the air box and gives you much more room to work.

Plastic air duct on left side (two bolts here, one visible with a clamp and
the other behind the blower motor on the top of the duct.

Cautions:  Some have said it's necessary to removed the plugs when adjusting
the valves to reduce compression when turning the crank-DO NOT DO THIS.
Information from Pfan members has suggested that carbon deposits from the
plugs could fall between the valve seat and head, and when turning the crank
could cause an inaccurate (way off) reading of the current valve spec.  The
compression will not inhibit turning the crank shaft when the plugs are in.

Process:
Once all of the items have been removed (description is based on a 3.2L coupe)
and the oil has been drained, the valve covers can now be removed.  Start from
the middle and work your way out to the sides in a diagonal fashion (this is
more important when re-installing the covers).  This will be done 4 times (two
intake banks and two exhaust).

Using a ring spanner (not sure if it's 17mm or 22mm) turn the crank shaft
pulley clockwise to obtain TDC (top dead center) on cylinder #1 (the firing
order is 1-6, 2-4, 3-5).  This means that when #1 is at TDC and the plug has
ignited the gases, the piston will force the crank to rotate downwards from
the expansion of gases in cylinder #1 while the #6 cylinder is rotating
upwards from a point some where in its compression stroke to be the next
cylinder in the TDC sequence.  The crank shaft has now turned 120 degrees to
get to the #6 cylinder in the next firing order sequence from the #1 TDC
position.  (120+120+120=360 degrees where the sum of each 120 degree marking
on the crank shaft pulley gives a 360 degree rotation or 1 full rotation of
the crank shaft since the firing order has 6 cylinders the complete adjustment
cycle would take the crank shaft through 2 full rotations (360+360 degrees),
where each valve at TDC occurs every 120 degrees in the cycle).

To check and make sure the #1 cylinder is on TDC, I had the valve covers
removed before hand (making note of where the #1 cylinder is) and rotated the
crank via the ring spanner wrench to the designated markings on the crank
shaft pulley (some pulleys may not be labeled properly, so just keep rotating
the crank to each marking, there are only three).  I would then 'wiggle' the
rocker of both the #1 intake and exhaust valves to see where the most play is
(it could also go the other way where the valves are in fact tightened and not
loosened) so as a check remove the distributor cap and see if the rotor is
facing the #1 plug wire.  With these three checks I was certain that I had the
right cylinder in the correct position (TDC) to begin the adjustment process.

Once at TDC (based on crank pulley turns to their markings, manual 'play'
check on respective rockers themselves for cylinder #1 and positioning check
of the rotor facing the #1 plug wire you are ready to begin the feeler gauge
process).
It is highly recommended that the Porsche feeler gauge be used (the ones that
are advertised in Automotion and Performance Prods).  Get extra blades in case
the original cracks, they do crack!  The clearance spec is designated at
0.004" (4 one thousandths of an inch) for BOTH exhaust and intake valves.  The
gauge itself must be placed between the top of the valve stem an the tappet on
the rocker arm.
I 'practiced' to get the feel of the adjustment procedure on #1 for a while,
just to build confidence.  The gauge might fit right in on the first attempt
at which the valve is then loose (greater clearance between stem and tappet).
If the gauge doesn't fit in, the valve may be 'tight' where the clearance is
smaller than the gauge.  Using a closed end wrench and slotted screw driver,
loosen the nut and then turn the screw until the gauge feeler slides between
the stem and tappet.  Tighten the screw until there is a mild resistance (best
way to describe the feel) between the stem and tappet.  LEAVE THE FEELER GAUGE
BETWEEN THE STEM AND TAPPET and tighten up the adjustment nut.  This will
prevent the assembly from tightening up on you and throwing off your
adjustment.  Pull out the adjuster gauge once the nut is tightened and recheck
the clearance.  Do the same WITH OUT turning the crank shaft to do BOTH
exhaust/intake valves of the single cylinder #1 on TDC.
Once cylinder #1 is adjusted (both exhaust and intake) you now turn the crank
shaft pulley 120 degrees clockwise to get to the next cylinder in the firing
order sequence (see above) in this case from the #1 it would the #6 that is
the next in order to fire at TDC.

Do the 'triple check' i.e.. pulley markings, free play on cylinder rocker
arms, and rotor position if in doubt.  I like to compare the free play of the
cylinder I'm adjusting on TDC to the other cylinders that are some where in
the combustion cycle, you will notice the difference between the play in the
cylinders which adds to the learning experience, but always remember, the
valves can tighten up as well as be loose, that is why the 'triple check' is
important and reassuring.
It never hurts to check, re-check and check again.  It's good practice and
provides the experience for the adjustment process.  Re-assembly is just the
reverse of disassembly-DO NOT FORGET TO PUT THE OIL BACK IN !!! as mentioned
previously, be good to your car and change it's oil and filter at this time.
It would also be a good opportunity to clean the valve covers and scrap any
gasket or grit off the face where the cover bolts onto the head.  These
instructions are based on my experience and I've provided a few tips on how to
ensure where TDC is.  Thinking this process over and the logistics of the
process will make it easy to understand where you are in the firing order
sequence.  I would however strongly recommend that this information be used
and checked for complete accuracy (not a certified mechanic by any means, just
a fellow who loves my car).
Enjoy the process and best of all learn! ... this kind of activity makes
Porsche driving even more rewarding!
Joe
