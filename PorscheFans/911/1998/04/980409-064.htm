Ongoing saga...

Well, I got "something" to work.  I cut off the long connector (mirror side)
and wired as directed.  Hmmm... first type (lists 84-89 having two blue
wires - mine is an 84 that has the same wiring as the 83, according to BW
docs).  Anyway, I wired up the browns through, all whites together, blk/yel
to black.  Now, I can determine which direction the reds and yellows are...
I marked them.

The sh*tty thing is that the "mirror selection" switch is not shutting down
the output as it should.  I would think it would interfere with the ground
(brown) and only allow gnd to the side selected.  No dice, though.  It
appears that when I move the toggle horiz L+R. the relay snaps.  I would
expect it to snap for all 4 directions of movement when selected to a
particular side, limiting current to the other mirror.  If I can figure this
out, I'm due for an honorable Electrical Engineering degree!  It also
doesn't help that the relays are covered in goop (thanks BW) to further help
in diagnosing this....

Anyone, please help me before I take a life (prob my own!)

I'm not sure what car you have. If it's an 87 or newer you sholud only have
to use the plugs on your wiring harness as their the round 6 pin should be
the same as the replacement light.
To open the thing up there is a little hole in the bottom with a sliding
plastic groove that a flat screw driver will fit in. Move this about 3/4" of
an
inch
one way or the other and turn the mirror upside down while holding the glass
and it comes right off, the glass that is.
It's really ingenious once you see how it works.....
I have an 86 and have to create a plug that goes from my wiring harness up
to
the
flat plug soo let me know what you hear from others.....
Hope this helps, I'm glad i'm not the only one who thought the instructions
were BS, and BW is not real "caring" ......
