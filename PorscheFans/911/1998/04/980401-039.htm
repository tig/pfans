I am in love, I drove a Boxster for the first time the other
day with the top down.  What an awesome car!  It was a
tiptronic and could definately use some more horsepower
but a great car none the less.  If the new 996 is like the 
boxster sign me up!

Turning from my street to head to work the other day this
300ZX passed in front of me.  I turned and followed and he
jumped on the gas, I was all over his tail.  We came up on
a corner and when we straightened out he nailed it again
I again was all over him.  He had some mods, different exhaust,
air inlets on the front, who knows what else.  Anyway we turn
onto a four lane road and again he jumps on it only this time I
take the left lane and blow by him like he is standing still.

Boy that was fun!!   Yeah, Yeah I know save the racing for the
track but sometimes you have to take the challenge.  Spare
me all the flame mail.  Talk to ya later.
