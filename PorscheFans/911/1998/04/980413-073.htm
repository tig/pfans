Pfans,
   I recently posted some questions related to my search for a late
80's early 90's 911.  Thanks to all those who responded!  A few people
asked about the pressure sensor problem on C4's.  I misplaced a couple
of the the names of those asking about this problem so I am resending
the original post to the list:

Subject: early C4 traction control regulator hints to bliss If you own
a C4 and it has the really expensive green anodized pressure sensor in
the traction control pump that tends to leak around the 0-ring...
(the part has been updated- its recomended that you change it before
it dies on you) if yours was replaced; and before it was replaced it
spewed
out the brake fluid all over your boot... you may want to check your
wiring harnesses around the ABS unit pump and the traction control
units right around the battery.. if you look about 5cm above the
battery and to the right ..into the channel where there are two
harnesses jammed in there..  you may find that some of the corrosive
brake fluid is eating away at the
harness tape and eating into the wires... (mine were getting crispy)
and a few were shorting.. I re-wired the harness and re-taped it. It
looks good now, but the problem with  the fluid coming out of the
0-ring is common.. so be aware of that spot.
