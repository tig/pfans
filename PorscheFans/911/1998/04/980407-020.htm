	Hi Jim:

	I manufacture and sell catback exhaust and performance products for all
Porsche late model cars. Fabspeed offers 3 products for the 993 Porsche
cars.
	1. Cat back Supercup 'dual use' ' and dual tone' sport muffler system.
This system is a virtual copy of the Porsche factory Supercup racing system
with a unique catch. Porsche used straight pipe after the catalytic
converter with no mufflers whatsoever. Fabspeed offers T304SS mandrel bent
tubing with a 3.5" outlet that hold a Stainless Steel removable muffler
baffle. The 993 picks up sports car sound that is missing and the most
power available of all the systems tested -on the Dyno and empiracly at the
"Ring".The customer has the only dual use ( street & track) and dual tone (
throughtier than Motorsound package and very aggressive sound over Motor
sound- your choice)
	 At drivers Education, Club races, track events, or  at owners preference,
one simply removes the mufflers by undoing 1 allen bolt set screw, with out
a lift, and thereby slipping out the muffler/baffles , a 5 minute
procedure. The customer now basically has the factory Supercup 3.8L exhaust
system with cooler  3.5" angle cut outlets (Supercup has 3" outlets). One
additional advantage of Fabspeed is that the system is serviceable and
tunable. All mufflers especially BORLA and B&B Triflo burn out even when
stuffed with 100% SS mesh and SS and Fiberglass.This is why all systems get
louder and louder until basically the owner has a big SS resonating garbage
can. With Fabspeed's 993 system one can add/readd 304SS wool and super
hitemp E glass and reinsert. Price $950
	2. Performance chips for all Porsche cars. Dyno developed and tuned for
street and track for modified cars. If you remove your catalytic
converters, goto big tube headers, change the displacement to 3.4; 3.8L, 
and/or add a Lite weight flywheel- what are you going to do run your stock
aftermarket performance based chip?  You can but get ready to give the
"signal" as we say in the States. Not.
	3. Cat Bypass pipes for 993 with O2 sensor; also avail or all cars but for
export only and for offroad use only!. Works great with Supercup exhaust.
This system won virtually every US club race entered and consistently
placed in almost all the top 5 finishing spots.   

	Pretty soon Fabspeed will have its WEB site up with plenty of Data and
Dyno  curves. I will have before and after Dyno runs on a multitude of 944
Turbos, 3.0 SCs, 3.2L Carerras, C2/C4 3.6 & 3.8L, 993 1995- 1998, Boxster,
1999 996 by 5/98, and a factory Supercup Car bone stock and then without
catalytic converter and new Fabspeed chip. Other projects: 993 header
muffler for stock heat exchangers. Mufflers for the 996 and a sport pipe
sold as 1 kit.
	Give us a call we be glad to add England to our list of Countries served.
Also free shipping to the UK as my wife flies to Heathrow twice a  month as
a flight attendant for United Airlines.
