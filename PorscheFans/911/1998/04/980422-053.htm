Hi All,
	Thanks to those that responded to my targa latch
question.  In my never ending quest to tweak my 911 to
perfection, I've been trying to adjust my '78 CIS mixture
by RPM.
	My 911 has always run best for the 10-20 minutes
after starting cold.  After that, the engine seems to develop
a burble in the exhaust, like one of the cylinders regularly
not firing properly, or some kind of texture in the exhaust note.
The engine does not stumble, miss, or backfire, and always
seems to have good power.  The last time I replaced the
plugs, the centers electrodes were all nice and tan with
a blackness around the rim. All the plugs look about
the same.  The engine does tend to get a little warm on load
(halfway up the temp meter on a hill climbing hot day).
	Thinking that maybe after warmup, the mixture is
too lean anyway,  I tweaked the mixture toward the rich
side at idle after warm up.   I've heard before that the CIS
mixture adjustment is very touchy, going from too rich
to too lean in 10 degrees of mixture nut movement, but
I must have cranked that wrench more than 90 degrees
toward the rich side before I noticed any change in the
RPM, and then the RPM went up noticeably.  I tuned
for maximum RPM at idle.
	The engine then had that deep tone of being a
little too rich.  The burble is still there, perhaps subdued
somewhat (or maybe its less noticeable over the deep
tone of the engine).  Since then I've cranked back 
about 40 degrees on the mixture to get out some of
that rich tone.
	My questions are:  Is there anything else I should
be looking at to get rid of that burble in the exhaust?  Fuel
injectors/delivery?  O-rings?  Just have a worn engine
(140k on the clock)?  Am I screwing anything up tweaking
the mixture without a CO meter?  Destroying the catalytic
converter with a rich mixture?  Am I wrong for trying to tune
the mixture based on RPM?

Best Regards,
