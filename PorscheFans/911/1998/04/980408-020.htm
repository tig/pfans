Well finally found the car I've been looking for.  1994 C-2 Coupe, Guards
Red/Tan 30,000 miles factory 6 disk CD changer, never tracked or wrecked,
full records.  It's at the dealership being checked out as we speak
(metaphysically speaking) hope to sign the papers on Friday.  Asking price
is $41,800 seems to be a great price, any comments on this would be
appreciated.  Originally wanted a 1995 993 but it was out of my budget.

On with my questions:  Car has 16" rims and factory exhaust/chip.  Am
looking to upgrade rims to factory 17" with an aftermarket exhaust/chip.
Any recommendations/experience with exhaust and chip upgrades would be
welcome.  What kind of HP increase can I expect with this combo?  What
brands do you like?  Anyone with some or all of this for sale?  P-Fans has
been a great tool making this search so successful thanks to all of you.
