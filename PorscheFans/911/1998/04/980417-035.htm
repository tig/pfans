I have decided to sell my '83 930 slant nose (triple black)and would
appreciate some input into what is a fair price to ask.  Short
description - all steel conversion (Porsche dealer says beautiful work),
K-27 turbo, variable boost, 935 boost guage, 42,000 miles actual, 3
piece BBS lightweight racing wheels, turbo mirrors, sunroof, etc.  Borla
exaust system (but muffler cored, so not unlike sitting at turn 1 at the
track).  My mechanic had maintained this car for 3 - 4 years prior to
the last two years I have owned the car, so I have always felt good
about the history. 

Obviously it is a Euro car, since 930s were not available again in US
except as euro conversions until 87.  Door stickers, etc, say the car
was originally brought in by Scottsdale Porsche Audi.  

Finally, it does look good.  Described by some as Darth Vader's personal
wheels.

Thanks, Mike Graham
