The other night at a pre-tech of cars before my local
PCA region's first DE event, I saw  an unusual cooling item. 
On a modified, beautiful green '72 911T , there was this brass 
water sprayer device about 6 inches from the engine fan mounted 
near the rear hatch.  The owner told me that by spraying a mist of
water into the fan's intake, it noticeably helped cooling
the engine during track events.  The car's owner did not
know much about where this device came from for it
was installed when he bought the car.  Where do I get
one? or better yet is this something that can be easily
fabricated by a DIYer?

Anybody on the list have one of these gizmos?  Pro and Cons, 
experiences, or is this just  a one off oddity?

Hey my engine is finally running after two years, and will
soon be  on the road again.
