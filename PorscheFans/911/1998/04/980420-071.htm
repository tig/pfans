These comments are in regards to the 964-based C4:

I guess this depends on your definition of "real world". The C4 has much
more understeer than the C2. The C4 does not feel as "sporty"  as the the
C2. It has a heavier feel to it. The C4 does not get more traction. The
last time I checked the C2 and C4 had the same suspensions and same size
tires. The C4 is better at utilizing its power in wet weather conditions
since it can distribute that power over all four tires.

The 993-based C4 is a much better car. It still has the same problems but
it certainly feels more like its C2 counter part than the 964-based C4
does.

The only way you could get me to take a 964-based C4 is if you gave it to
me. The only exception would be if I lived in a place that had bad enough
weather that made it more practical. Of course, I would not live in a
place that had weather that did....

The C4 is not quicker off the line than a C2. Any road test I have seen
has the C2 beating the C4 at every measured speed and distance.

The 964-based C4 all wheel drive systems is very expensive if anything
goes wrong. The 993-based C4 has a mechanically simpler system that is
much more reliable.

Unless you drive where you must have all wheel drive, I would stay away
from a 964-based C4. The 993-based C4 is much better but still not as nice
as the 993 C2.
