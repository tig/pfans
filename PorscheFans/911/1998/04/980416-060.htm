Hello P Fans,

    I'm hoping someone can help with a few questions I have. Can anyone
recommend a source for good quality but not expensive seat covers for my
993? I have seen a number of adds in Excellence for sheepskin covers in
the $100-120 price range per seat. Does anyone have any experience with
different brake pads that don't produce as much dust as the factory
ones? If so, can you tell me how much and where to get these pads? I
have seen some posts on Metal Master pads before. I have a Porsche car
cover that isn't very good and beginning to wear through, can someone
recommend a good cover that isn't too bulky or costly that can handle
the mid-Florida east coast weather (Clearwater/Tampa)? Has anyone tried
to repair stone chips and what technique did you use? Larry Reynolds of
Care Care Specialties has a procedure that sounds reasonable, has anyone
tried Larry's approach?

Thanks for all the help, someday maybe I'll be able to return the favor.
