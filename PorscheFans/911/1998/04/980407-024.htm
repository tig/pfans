Looking at buying an 1985 911 Cabrio to replace my 71 911T Targa.

78 000 KMs (approx 45K miles)
Original paint - white with navy top and interior
Drivers side elec seat only.
Has aftermarket wheels on it but owner has original white rims
Aftermarket stereio but he has original speakers and deck.
Aftermarket alarm (Alpine - impact sensor only)

He is asking $ 35000 Canadian.

My questions:

0) Headliner is torn from raising/lowering the top. Can just the =
headliner be replaced without replacing the entire top ? Costs ?

1) Small tear in the right rear of the top near the hinge area. Can the =
material be repaired ? Does the top have to be replaced ? Costs ?

2) What size tires are used on this car on the factory wheels. It will =
probably need tires and I want to price some out. I forgot to look at =
the tire size on the aftermarket wheels.

3) Any thing to look out for on this year of car or with Cabrio's in =
general. Ie. Motor issues, rust areas etc.

4) How is the price ?

I will have my machanic perform all the tests listed in the FAQ I just =
wanted to ask if anyone had anything to be wary of with this particular =
model/year.

Thanks in advance

Scott Burns

P.S. No word on the stuck injector problem on my 71 with the 73CIS yet. =
Keep you posted once my machanic has a chance to look at it.
