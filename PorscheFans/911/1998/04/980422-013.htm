Scott,
I think your opinion is completely biased.  I have done a lot of reading on
the 964 AWD system and it actually is one of the most advance AWD systems
available.  The 993 uses the viscous coupling that every other AWD car (not
4X4) uses and it is also very good.

The 964 has a computer that purposely locks the front differential under
high lateral Gs to cause understeering (and prevent oversteering).  This can
be electronically defeated which then makes the car very neutral.

They are both very efficient systems and there is no difference in power
loss.

There is a really good article covering the 964, 993 and many others at:
http://www.eskimo.com/~eliot/awd.html

The article is titled "Introduction to All Wheel Drive Systems", it
describes the different systems and how they work.

Check it out,
Luis
