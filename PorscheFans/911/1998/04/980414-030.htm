What would be a good way to go about checking the varioram induction system
on my 964?? I recall that I was able to hear quite different tones on
acceleration as the resonant induction system did its work.. now the tone
seem to stay the same... I was thinking that I would just teardown the
intake manifold and look around and see if the flap seems to work.. I had
also noted some oil coming out of the bottom of one of the rubber plenum
pipes on the lower stage of the two stage system below the trottle body...
could this be the source of a vaccuum leak????  is it bad to have oil in
that area as well??
