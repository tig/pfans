I've posted a couple of times about a high idle and metallic rubbing sound at 
certain revs in my 83SC.  I took it to my mechanic.  The pressure-fed
tensioners that I had installed had collapsed.  The right side was totally 
collapsed.  My mechainc said the left was softer than it should be as well.

So, with a couple of hundred bucks dropped at that point just to find out what it 
was, I had him finish the job.  Basically, I ended up spending pretty much the 
same as I would have if they had done the whole job in the first place.  While it 
bums me out that I bascially wasted time and money putting the kit in myself, I 
am very happy that no damage was done to my engine.

I also want to be sure that this whole problem was defective parts and not 
incompetence on my part.  I'm still new at dealing with these cars, so I want to 
learn from  this if I can.

1)  How is it that these 'bulletproof' tensioners were collapsed after about 5000 
miles ?  I guess no manufacturing process is perfect, but could I have done this 
somehow while installing them?  Or could they be knockoffs ?  Or is it just bad 
luck and I happened to get two of the rare number of defects from Stuttgart ?

2)  Even though it has only been 5K or so since I put them in, it has been 9 
months since I bought them via mail order.  Do I have legitmate claim to get my 
money back ?

3) If #2 is true, can I only get back what they charge for the two tensioners 
themselves ?  I bought it as a complete kit, but I'm not about to return the oil 
lines or the chain covers.  It'd be nice if I was covered for time or money of 
getting a pro to do it, but I guess that's a pipedream.

4) Hypothetical question:  IF a pair of defective tensioners bought via mail order 
and installed by a home mechanic had collapsed and caused the engine to 
need a complete rebuild, would the mail order company be liable ?

Thanks.
