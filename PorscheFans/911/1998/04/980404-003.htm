I don't know exactly what is going on with the Steve Timmins bashing, but I
for one can attest to his honesty and forthrightness.  I bought a 2.4 liter
engine and 915 tranny from him last year.  There were several delays on his
end, but all merchandise arrived in better condition than advertised.  In
addition, he refunded me $150 for my troubles.

I have seen several of the postings from Steve where he has attempted to
help others.  I am a big fan....I somebody has a problem with him, then
take it off line...
