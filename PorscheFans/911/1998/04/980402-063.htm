Hey list,
I am contemplating making my '75 911S coupe look like a '74 Carrera RS.
I don't want an exact copy, just the stripped race car  look.(I'm not
trying to pass it off as "the real deal") I was thinking about maybe a
stripped light weight interior. But I don't want the unfinished look. I
was wondering if anyone on the list has ever done this.How should I
finish out the rear without the seats and make it look good. Also would
you go with the harness bar or the roll cage?(car is stripped to the
bone for MAJOR frame up (pan?) restoration, so its not a big deal to do
either.)
  I would also like to know if anyone uses headers and megaphones with
resonators on a street car. Noise doesn't bother me.I've done this
before on a different car and if you shift REAL careful, you can avoid
ticking anyone off. Notice any substantial increases?(or decreases?)
 And lastly if anyone has any info on the RS please forward it to me.
TIA
