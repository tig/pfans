I bought these from Stoddard's.  I don't know how truly important they
are, but at a couple of $ each (if that much) I splurged.  :>)

As a small plug for Stoddard's, I have used them over the years for a
variety of parts (I don't have a Porsche dealer anywhere near me) and
they have consistently pleased me with their service and their prices.
