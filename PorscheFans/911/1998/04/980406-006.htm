I know this brake bleeding subject is getting to 
be the bane of the list, but I have a problem.  
I bled the brakes this weekend and also changed 
the pads.  Afterward, I got in the car to go 
break them in, and the pedal was soft.  It 
usually only goes halfway to the floor, no 
matter how hard I press them.  The pedal will 
now go almost all the way to the floor, but 
doesn't stop that great.  I used a one man 
bleeder system, that keeps the MC full and 
catches the old fluid in a bag.  I don't think I 
got any air in the system, but I'm not sure.

So, I go back to my friendly Pep Boys, and get 
some more fluid and ask the guy if I may have broken the MC by pushing 
the piston of the MC too far.  He said maybe, but try a gravity drain, 
by opening the MC reservior and opening the bleeder screws one at a 
time.  I tried to do that, but the @#$#$#$ Geuine Porsche locking wheel 
nuts I bought (the only one that won't throw your wheel out of balance 
BTW) broke!!  The side of the damn key cracked, so I can't get any of 
them off of my wheels now!  I assume that I can get a replacement, but 
I will try to return them as defective, since I just bought them a 
month ago.  Anyway, my question:  How do you know when the MC is out of 
order?  Symptoms, remedies, tests for failure?  While I'm at it, how do 
I get those locking lugs off the car without a key that works??

Any help appreciated,
