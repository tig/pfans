Listmembers,

My baby needs new shoes....I drive my 1984 Carrera every day to work, and
do not race or auto cross it.  Currently, I have Yokohama A-509's on it,
which came with it when I took possession two years ago.  While the tires
seemed to perform ok, they didn't last very long at all, a little more than
15k miles.

I'm looking at some Bridgestones, the RE940 model.  Tracktion and temp
ratings are A, speed is Z, and treadwear is 220 (versus the Yoko's 140).  

Can anyone give their impressions re:
driveability/durability/handling/weather characteristics?

Costco will mount thewhole set for $526.00 out the door  ($109.00 for the
fronts, $119.00 for the rear, tax, etc)

Good tire?  Good price?  Please cc: mail to mti@ccnet.com.

Regards,

John D.
