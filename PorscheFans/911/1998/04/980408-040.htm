Well thanks to Bruce Anderson, I discovered that my 75 s Targa does not have
the dreaded thermal reactors after all, originally  delivered in Virginia.
Beautiful  !!!!!!!!     That leaves me with the oil leaks I mentioned earlier
and a desire to make this car run as cool as possible this summer. (Memphis
does get warm sometimes)
  
As far as I can tell - other than that the car performs well.... I have all of
the service records I think and all of the major services(30,000 - 60,000 and
90,000) mile stops were apparently observed.

I will continue to go over them but so far I haven't found any head stud
problems or any other "major" opportunities in this silver anniversary's
history. With all of the horror stories I have heard regarding the 2.7 engine
- I must admit that I have been expecting the worst.

All things considered, I feel pretty good right now.

                             Thanks again Bruce................Rick
