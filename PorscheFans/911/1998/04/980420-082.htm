Not trying to start one either. But someone needs to be the "devil's
advocate" in regards to the 964 C4! ;-)

The C4 may get more traction during initial acceleration from a standstill
IF you drop the clutch and spin the wheels. But the C2 walks away from the
C4 rather quickly after that (R&T data notwithstanding). The overall
potential traction of the cars are the same in any other situation.

I have driven several 964-based C4 coupes and one 964-based C4 cab in
anger at autocrosses. It is damn near impossible to get them to rotate
effectively. They are terrible cars for autocross. I don't think the
993-based C4 is much better in this regard. Yes, you can dial out some of
the understeer by changing springs and sway bars. You are wasting you time
playing with tire pressures. The all-wheel drive systems cause more
understeer. There is no way to get rid of that without geting rid of the
front drive.

Too slow? What the heck does that mean? Please provide a quote from
Porsche that suggests that Porsche "was trying to prove that 911's can be
configured not to oversteer" when they designed the 964. The 964 has a
very adequate suspension setup.

And I mean it too! For what I want, the 964 C4 is horrible. It does not
drive like a Porsche should. It understeering badly and is heavy feeling
compared to the already too heavy 964 C2. If I want a car that feels like
a sporty coupe, that's what I will buy.

These tests were done on different days over a year apart. That data is
worthless. The 993 cars are faster, not slower.....

They may look the same and weigh almost the same. But they do not feel the
same.

Dude, the 964 C4 ALWAYS has some power going to the front wheels. The 993
C4 does not. This is one of the reasons it is a better car.

The 993 C$ is simpler and should be more reliable. That's all I said.

I did not say one should buy the 993 or the 993 C4. All I said was that I
would not buy a 964 C4. I would much rather have a 964 C2 than a 964 C4!

That does not happen here in Northern California. At least not with
competent drivers at the wheel. A stock '83 944 will not touch a 993 (C2
or C4) on any autocross course I have driven....
