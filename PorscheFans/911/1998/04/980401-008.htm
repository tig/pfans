The server replied with an error message so here it goes again:

Hello everyone,
=20
The hidden (or hard to get to) set of spark plugs in my 90 C4 Cab are so =
worn that the engine won't even start if I disconnect the second =
distributor (new caps and rotors) that drives the other 6 plugs.  I have =
obviously made plans to replace them this coming weekend but, I have =
three questions.
=20
1- What is the recommended spark plug for this car?  Because of how hard =
it is to change these, if performance is not affected I would like to =
use platinum so that they last longer.
=20
2- What is the best gap opening?
=20
3- Since I haven't got the manuals yet, I would appreciate if someone =
could briefly tell me what are the steps to follow and how hard it is to =
remove the exhaust system.  I have followed the previous posts in this =
listserv about this topic but they have been very brief.
=20
Thanks in advance.
Luis
