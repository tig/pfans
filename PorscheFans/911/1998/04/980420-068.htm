Just wanted to tell the world that I got the car out this weekend and had a ball at a RMR DE.  It is the first DE I've attended and was a lot of fun.  

The event was held at Second Creek Raceway in Denver CO where the Club Race will be just before the Parade.  I've raced vintage and this was just as much fun in a different way.  Without the racing to concentrate on and with a fairly clear track, I was able to concentrate on technique and make minor changes and observe the results.  I took an instructor out with me and found that was very helpful as well.  He drives a 3.2 liter and was surprised by what my 30 year old 2.0 liter could do (in a car stripped to bare metal).  (I became a believer in MSD ignitions this weekend)

There were a lot of beautiful cars out there and after the 8 inches of snow on Saturday morning, Sunday turned out to be nice and sunny.

Sadder news is that this year is the last Steamboat Springs Vintage street race. If you were ever planning on attending, either as a spectator or participant, this is the last chance.  There will be no race next year.  If it is resurected in 2000, it probably won't be a street race.  There is some talk of a track being built west of town.
