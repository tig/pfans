Shawn,

I have seen early "Lightweight" replicas which were so well done, you'd 
never know until you checked the VIN...and the minimalist interiors 
looked very appropriate on a 911.

My gut says that the pounds you save on a Porsche are more important, 
because the overall weight of the entire unit is much lower, so the 
weight you remove is higher, percentage-wise.  ANY weight you lose is 
important in cornering: the brakes work less hard, the throttle response 
improves, and the weight transfer (both side-to-side and fore-aft) is 
better...so you gain from turn-in to trackout.

One thing though -  think the early lightweights had the sound deadening, 
floor tar, and undercoating removed.  This stuff weighs a lot!  So if you 
want the job done completely, prepae for a full strip-down experiece.
