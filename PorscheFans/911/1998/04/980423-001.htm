Welcome to CA ... from a recent silicon valley transplant from Canada
(howz it going eh?)

The general rule is to import a vehicle from canada, you need a letter 
from the original manufacturer stating that it meets USEPA and safety 
standards. This assumes that the car does meet the standards in stock 
form (usually the case with canadian vehicles enetering the USA), and 
that no modifications have been done (if mods have been done there's a 
bunch of forms that have to be filled out etc). You would normally need 
this letter to import a canadian model vehicle into the USA, but since 
yours is a USA model you won't need it -- as long as it has the USEPA 
stickers on it. 

While living in Canada, I bought an Rx7 that was a USA model originally 
purchased in Nevada, the PO had imported it into Canada. About a year 
ago I moved to northern CA from Canada, and was asking the same kinds
of questions you are. I had the car shipped on a moving van with the
rest of my stuff, and the moving company kept insisting that I needed
the proper customs papers (letter from the manufacturer). That made no 
sense to me, since it is a USA model with stickers stating it meets
USEPA standards etc. But it's an AMERICAN car doncha know ...


>Since this was originally a US car, do I even have to do anything at all? 

The bottom line: I had NO problem getting the USA model car back 
across the border WITHOUT any special paperwork. As long as you have 
the proper stickers with USEPA and safety compliance, you should be 
okay getting it across. If you have original documentation, such as 
bill of sale from a US dealer, original certificate of title, and 
canadian import documents, make copies of those and keep them in the
car, also give them to shippers if you transport the car (but I bet
you'll drive yours instead ;-)

> What about emissions?

Okay, so that takes care or the federal customs dept, now you have
to deal with the california DMV. Since the car wasn't built for CA 
emissions, they charge a one-time "smog impact fee", which is around
$350. The DMV will also inspect the car and check the stickers and 
VIN. In CA, vehicles must be registered with the DMV each year, and
every 2 years they must pass a smog test. Be forewarned that you 
should get a PRETEST before doing the actual test, because it won't
send the results to the DMV computer (in case it fails, this gives 
you the chance to tune it). The real test automatically sends the 
results to the DMV, so you want to be sure you'll pass. There are 
two levels of failure of the test, and you don't want to reach the 
second level, which labels your vehicle as a "gross polluter". In the 
case of my Rx7, it failed miserably the first time around (pretest), 
and WOULD have been labelled a gross polluter if it was the real test
(if this happens, you must take your car to a state referee and go 
through mucho hassle and $$$). For the mazda, some simple tuning and 
replacement of a few ignition parts etc brought it in line.

> We have no testing here in Canada, in fact people use race pipes 
> blatantly around here.

Yeah, I took out the cat and air pump and put straight pipes on 
another Rx7, and it PASSED visual safety inspection in manitoba
(there are no smog tests). As long as the exhaust system doesn't 
leak, it's okay. But Canada is getting stricter too lately, and 
I bet straight pipes won't be allowed much longer.

The Rx7 has since become a large paperweight :( which prompted 
the purchase of an '87 911 Carrera :) No problem passing smog with 
the 3.2L, it was nowhere near the maximum allowable emissions. I 
doubt that there would be any problem with a 3.0L, as long as it 
has a cat. The DMV has different allowable emmisions for each year 
and model of car. The newer cars have much stricter standards, but 
you only have to meet the standard for the year of your car (actually 
the engine). There are different zones within CA that have different 
allowable smog rates. In southern CA the smog rates are stricter than 
where I am in northern CA. But I doubt that you'll have any problems 
as long as your car is tuned well.   

BTW if you're coming from Canada (or anywhere outside of the USA),
the DMV will make you take both a written and ROAD test to get 
your driver's license, parallel parking and all, just like the 
16-year-olds (much more fun in in a porsche than mom's car ;-)
The DMV also hassled me because I had no "certificate of title"
(there is no such thing in manitoba), this just caused some 
frustration and delay. Be sure to get a driver's abstract from
canada, you need that to get insurance (I insured my '87 911 for 
< $800/yr with TIG insurance of texas). While you're at it, you
might as well get copies of canadian credit bureau reports, 
because it's NOT easy to get credit down here (once again you
will be treated as a 16-year-old). One last suggestion, I would 
recommend selling your canadian model cars rather than importing
them, since they are devalued here, and you won't be able to 
sell them later.
   
Cheers,
Doug
