Help!  I was driving my 74 911 Targa along in 3rd gear, when a =
suspicious growling noise started to appear...first loud, than really =
loud...I down shifted to 2nd gear...no problems...noise there again =
though...came to a stop at stop sign, and had to grind gears in 1st =
(like it was spinning still), and then it popped in after the grinding =
slowed down and stopped....I was able to drive the remaining 1 and a =
half blocks in first gear with the grinding noise slightly there....

What happened?  My clutch went?  It has a new pressure plate in it as of =
last week.

Tech geek of the month award on the line here...!  :)

Thanks, Jeff Shirley    guardianangel@shaw.wave.ca
