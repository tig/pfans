Nigel,

My problem is slightly different.  It is a little hard to get the engine
going in the morning, once it gets going it hunts between 200 and 1200 but
if I step on the gas, either nothing happens or it dies.  I have to slightly
step on the gas and wait for it to start revving up. After a minute, it
responds to the gas pedal the way it should but even after warming it up, it
continues to idle at 200 and hunt up to 1000

Thanks for the info, I wont change the mass flow or O2 sensor since it looks
like it didn't fix the problem for you.

FYI.  I replaced the two distributor caps and rotors and although the car
gained 22 HP at the rear wheels, it didn't fix the starting or idling
problem.

Regards,
Luis
