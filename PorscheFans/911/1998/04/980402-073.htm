Subject: Mag Bra

Has anyone out there tried the Mag Bra for Driver Ed events?  I used the
thick clear adhesive film for the last event, but I hate the idea of
peeling it off each time (car is daily driver and the tape looks like crap
plus worried about fade with the sun on paint vs under the tape).  I only
want to use it for DE, and speeds are up to 130+ MPH on my 993 at Summit
Point.  Will the mag bra stay on?  Will it vibrate and scratch the paint?

I've heard people complain that the typical vinyl bras tend to lift at high
speed and flap around thus the possibility of paint scratches.  So, I'm
looking for alternatives.

Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks,
Kevin

If you are so worried about the potential for scratches caused by a regular
bra, WHY ARE YOU TAKING YOUR CAR TO THE TRACK?  
btw, I run a regular bra only at the track and if they are correctly installed
work great.
Also my .02 on passing of Prof. Porsche.  I'm sorry for the loss to his
family.  
I'll show my respect to him the way I always have.  By going 145 down the back
straight at the glen on sunday and taking my 5 year old to kindergarten on
monday in the same car.  What do you think he would like more:  That, or an
armband on my freaking antenna.  Please...
