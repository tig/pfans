Toumas,

1. Manual says it can be changed without removing the engine, is this 
   right. Any practical tips are also appreciated.

I've just had to do this on my car.  I have Weber carbs on my 73, so that
made access a little easier.  There are two nuts that need to come off on
the top, everything else is done from underneath.  You'll have to remove
the heat exchangers and some of the engine sheet metal on passenger side
to make room. Remove and plug the oil lines, and remove the two nuts on
the bottom.  You need to be careful you don't damage the seals when you
put it back in.
     
2. It is awfully expensive part. In case it it the cooler not the 
   seals is it possible to fix it?

I inquired about fixing mine, but ended up shopping around and buying a
used one.  Call several of the used parts dealers in Pano or Excellance.
You should be able to get one for 1/2 to 2/3 of a new one.  I think I got
mine from Oklahoma Foreign.  An oil cooler is too important to take any
chances.  Most of the major vendors will pressure test their used coolers,
ask to be sure.

Hope this helps
John
