    John:

    Your colleague's response is interesting... I'm no expert, but
    if you'd asked ME, I would've said:

        1.  The human eye is most sensitive to wavelengths in the
            middle of the visible spectrum (i.e., yellow-green).

        2.  As we age, our corneas yellow and our eyes lose their
            sensitivity to blue light... The sensitivity loss can be
            as great as 80%.

        3.  Even when we're young, we have problems resolving small
            details illuminated by blue light; blue light is
            refracted more than the longer wavelengths, so it focuses
            slightly IN FRONT OF the retina, rather than right ON the
            retina.  The result is that blue objects appear blurred.

        4.  Monochromatic computer displays are always amber/orange
            (for viewing in dark environments) or green (for viewing
            in bright environments).  They are NEVER blue.

        5.  If you look at the instruments in an aircraft cockpit or
            on a military ship, you won't see any that are
            illuminated by blue light.  Presumably, the FAA and our
            armed forces have chosen other colors for a reason.

        6.  If blue light provided better resolution, the spotlights
            on search-and-rescue and police helicopters would be
            blue.

        7.  If blue light provided better depth perception, aircraft 
            landing lights would be blue.

    If you have a moment, would you mind asking him to reconcile his
    comments with mine?

Later, David J. Kessler <dkessler@acm.org> replied:

    Dave:

    Actually, that's not exactly true... Short wavelengths (e.g.,
    blue) don't penetrate fog as well as longer wavelengths (red or
    yellow), but the MAIN reason that fog lights are yellow has to
    do with refraction, not penetration.

    When white light hits fog, it refracts, producing a dazzling
    rainbow effect.  Monochromatic light doesn't do that; red or
    green would work as well as yellow (red would actually penetrate
    FURTHER), but we use yellow because red and green lights have
    meaning in our society (red means "danger" or "stop", green
    means "ok" or "go").

    Also, rain's a little different from fog.  In water, blue-green
    light actually penetrates further than other colors... Which is
    why the Navy put so much money into the development of powerful
    room-temperature blue-green lasers.
