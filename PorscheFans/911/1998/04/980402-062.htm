<<1.  If the gear shifter is in neutral position and I let out the clutch the
car moves backward.

2.  I can move the  gear shift to only four positions.  In any of the four
positions when I let out the clutch the the car acts like the emergency
brake is engaged and the engine will stall.>>

Yup, been there on my '86. I backed it onto a flatbed and took it to my
mechanic. As I recall, he said he had to drain the trans, remove the
inspection cover on the bottom and realign the shiftrods, as one of them had
gone too far.. I worried about it for a while, but it never reoccurred for the
year  afterwards I had the car.  I always shifted into reverse gingerly after
that.

One mechanic told me that the detent ball or plunger that would prevent this
got displaced when the tranny was built and isn't able to do its job.
