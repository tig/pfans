<<I just purchased the Porsche factory "shortened shift kit" from the the
local dealer (part #91142493100).

Is this the correct part number for the 915 transmission (82 911SC)?  The
dealer was unable to verify so I went ahead and ordered it.  I was told I
could return it if it was not the correct one.

The kit is a box full of parts with no instructions.  Anyone installed this
kit?  Is it obvious how this stuff goes together once I get things apart?
Anyone receive written instructions with theirs?

Any and all help appreciated,>>

Jeff,
The part number you have appears correct. There are no instructions in the
kits I have seen. It helps to get an exploded drawing of the shifter assembly
from Haynes, factory SM, etc. to get a better idea of the parts relationship.
The parts in the kit look almost the same as the existing parts in your shift
housing. A bench vise will come in handy to D&A the unit as there are a couple
of strong coil springs (as you know) to remove and install. I had to do some
minor grinding and filing to achieve the desired amount of play (drag) of the
shift lever. You may or may not have to. Use some good grease to lube the
parts before you button it up, then check the shift tube bushings and coupler
for excessive wear and play. The 2-3, 4-5 shift has me reaching a bit too far
for comfort so I'm going to heat and bend the shift lever to get it a little
closer to me. On a scale of 1 (easy = change oil) to 10 (rebuild
transmission), I'd say this job is a 3-4. 

For PorscheFan readers, would it help if there was a list of repairs with
an"ease-of-repair" numerical index like the above? Perhaps one of those famous
Clic and Clac IQ/green thumb/how many kids you got vs. time continuum/post tax
payment dollars and dealership owner boat payment matrices we doodle with in
our free time.

I realize skill levels vary but it might offer some insight as to the relative
complexity of a procedure. Let's start with locating the gas tank filler on a
'72 911. This would be a 1?
