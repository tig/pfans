<<The other night at a pre-tech of cars before my localPCA region's first DE
event, I saw an unusual cooling item. On a modified, beautiful green '72 911T,
there was this brass water sprayer device about 6 inches from the engine fan
mounted near the rear hatch. The owner told me that by spraying a mist of
water into the fan's intake, it noticeably helped cooling the engine during
track events. The car's owner did not know much about where this device came
from for it was installed when he bought the car. Where do I get one? or
better yet is this something that can be easily fabricated by a DIYer?

Anybody on the list have one of these gizmos?  Pro and Cons, 
experiences, or is this just  a one off oddity? >>


Bill,
This is an idea that's been sitting in the back of my brain for awhile. There
are decided benefits for such a system to lower the air temperature going into
the engine, especially for short racing periods such as in time trialing or
for brief periods of stop and go driving with the A/C ON with high ambient air
temperatures. I had in mind using a system sold as cooling misters for
lowering the outdoor air temperature. These are sold at county fairs and at
your local hardware store. You can get a starter kit that contains a couple of
nozzles and fancier kits that can cool off a fairly large area. The kits I've
seen are mounted on 1/2" PVC pipe, the type used for irrigation systems. The
larger kits use line water pressure to create the fogging effect from the
system. Some kits include a 110V transformer to actuate an electric pump for a
few nozzles. I'm not sure what the minimum line pressure should be for just 1
or 2 nozzles, but perhaps a windshield washer pump controlled by an in-dash
ON-OFF switch could do it. Small diameter vinyl hose could connect the pump
and water supply (e.g. windshield washer reservoir or flexible water bag) to
the mister pipe/manifold. Such a system would add perhaps 5-10 lbs. to the
vehicle weight. As to the nozzle's mounting location(s); in front of the
cooling fan or external oil cooler come to mine as logical places. 

Another response to your question confused using water to cool the blower air
vs. cooling the air going into the intake manifold. This is water injection
and it was developed during WWII for turbocharged fighter plane engines
(Mustang?) to reduce the pressurized intake air temperature. This temperature
reduction, in turn, allowed higher boost pressures and suppressed detonation
for dramatic increases in horsepower even at high altitude. Existing
enrichment devices included with Turbo upgrades use the same principle of
injecting a cooling medium (gasoline) to suppress detonation.

A basic water injection system includes a source of water, a pump and a sized
orifice for metering the water. To provide water injection only during boost
conditions, you would need a pressure sensing switch to activate the pump.
When done correctly, water injection will provide more power and reduce engine
damaging detonation. For short track racing in a turbocharged engine, it will
definitely  help, less so for continuous passenger car use as you would a need
a large (and heavy) water supply. For a long time, J.C. Whitney, the mail
order guys, had various water injection systems available (still might). 

In the late 60's (look out, I'm dating myself), some acquaintainces of mine
had a turbocharged Corvair they took to Bonneville and broke a land speed
record of around 160 mph (pardon my fuzzy memory) for their class. The engine
was 164 cu. in. (2.7 l) and it had a water injection system for the 15-20 psi
boost pressure it produced. Quarter mile times were very fast as well. After
all is said and done, water injection may be illegal for certain types of
racing, so you'd better check your local listings. Misting to cool the cooling
air, however, should be okay, though you'd better check here too. Your race
organizer (and fellow racers) may not want an accidental discharge of your
misting water under their tires, although non air-cooled racers (ROW = rest of
the world) usually don't have a problem with potential moistness. Has anyone
else seen a working system on a P-car?
