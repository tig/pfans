My '87 has developed an intermittant electrical problem over the last few
days.  While driving, the tach will suddenly read high and the oil pressure
and temp guages will fluctuate wildly.  Everything else electrical works
fine and the engine runs fine.  It happens both at constant speed and when
up/down shifting. It does not appear at idle.  The battery may be a little
weak, but it's plenty strong for starting the car.  The problem was
particularly bad yesterday (high electrical load; headlights, wipers,
radio, heater blower, a/c running and continued even when decreasing load)
with the CASIS light blinking on in 5th gear, tach displaying 5200 rpm when
3000 was actual, oil pressure indicated steady 2 bar when 3.75 was actual)
but did not appear this morning (headlights and radio).  I'm guessing its
the DME, battery, or a bad engine or instrument ground but that's the limit
of my abilities without some help.  Any suggestions?
