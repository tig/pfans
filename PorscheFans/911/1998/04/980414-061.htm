I have reached  the 75,000 mile mark on my 90 C4 and as soon as it stops raining I will take it to my local 
shop for the required maintenance.  It seems however that most of the people I talk to have different ideas as 
to what I need to have done. Some say replace the plugs and fuel filter others say don't worry about it since 
they were replaced at 60k. 

To me it seems that if you need to get to the valves you might as well change the plugs as well. 

I would like to ask the List for any input as to what this maintenance should include.

Also I have a hi-beam (drivers side) that is burned out. Is this a bulb replacement or do I have to buy the 
entire light assembly?

Thanks

Jim
