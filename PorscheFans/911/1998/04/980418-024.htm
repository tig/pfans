JP:
If a '68 is like a '66, the rear deck has a bar across the top.  That
bar is held on by several screws.  The rear deck is also held down by
the luggage strap brackets you mention.  Luggage straps are a rarely
seen option and a holdover from the 356.  Once the bar is removed, you
find metal tabs welded to the chassis.  The rear deck panel, one piece
from the window to the rear seats, is slotted for the tabs to fit
through.  You may have to remove the side upholstery panels also.  Once
removed, the rear deck panel can be reupholstered.
