Aldo,
I think that I have to agree with you about my wife's ulterior motives.  
:-)   I think that the thing that turned me off on the 996 was the 
headlamps.  While they look good on the Boxster, they make the 996's 
front end look too "Made in Japan."  I think that if they can add some 
flairs to break up the slab-sided look, and perhaps a fixed tail of some 
sort, they may be headed in the right direction.  (All of the 
aerodynamicists are probably groaning at this point!!)  (Also, dump the 
current headlights for the 993's lamps and they will be onto something.)

Just my $0.02,
Alex Gilmour

1981 SC Euro

Alex, your wife's (non-car person) opinion seems to me a little biased in
saving the money you would spending trading your SC for a mint new 996...
Just a joke. By the way, I would rather have in my garage a SWB, a 2.7 RS,
my old Carrera 3.2, my 964 Turbo, a 993 RSR, a 993 GT2 and, why not, a 996,
sorted chronologically and not for desirability! I absolutely prefere a 993
or a 964, but I don't think the 996 doesn't look Porsche, for both look and
drive...

Aldo
