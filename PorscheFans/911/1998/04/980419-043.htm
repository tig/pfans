Hiya, folks, got a few things cluttering the garage:

1) Summer's on the way, why not improve your pre-87 911 AC with a
Performance Aire underdash bulkhead AC vent kit? This will increase the
airflow into the cabin by a large amount by replacing the plastic diverter
under the dash which serves only to cool the footwells. They sell 'em new
for $55; I have a new, never installed, one in the box that I'll sell for
$35 (plus shipping - it's a small box). Requires drilling one hole in the
bulkhead with a holesaw to install. Bought it for my 83 911SC, but never
put it in - lost my nerve when I plugged in the drill!  I now own a 1988
Carrera and it can't be used in there without a bigger installation hassle
due to rerouting of the AC ducts. This is the bulkhead kit Bruce Anderson
mentions in his fine book.

2) If your Carrera's steering wheel (4-spoker) is looking ratty, I'll sell
the one off my 88 Carrera for $225 plus shipping ... black leather, nice
shape. You can buy a recovering kit for your wheel from Alan Gunn, but it
is a real bitch to install ... I got my girlfriend to do it on my first
1980 911SC. Came out great. She's my wife now, and just flat out refused on
the 83 SC ... make of that what you will. Currently coveting smaller 930S
wheel.

3) Have the original Blaupunkt Reno cassette and Blaupunkt speakers from
the 88 Carrera, removed when the car was new by the PO, unused, I'll take
$100 (plus shipping) for the radio and four speakers ... does the radio
still work and speakers sound good after 10 years in a box? I dunno. That's
why it's $100. But the 10-year-old speakers in the car now sound just fine.

4) Set of four wheel centers, grand prix white with color crest, bought
from Robert Wood Inc. a few years back, three perfect, one with a slight
chip, $100 plus shipping.
