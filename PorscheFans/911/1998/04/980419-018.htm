Thanks Eric!

I ended up taking a 7/16" drill bit (leaves just enough material in the
wall) and grinding a piolot (guide i.d.) on the end (cutting surface
parallel to the top edge of the guide).  I then used it in the manner you
described - I drilled down, leaving a quarter inch at the bottom, and
drove 'em out. The only difference between the process you described and
my experience was the fact that an ordinary ball-pean hammer was enough to
drive the guide out (with 'medium' blows).

It was a simple process.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
