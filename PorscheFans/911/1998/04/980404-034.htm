Sean,
Yes, Aeroquip, as well as Earl's and other hose guys carry metric thread AN
fittings, but from what I've seen, they're limited to sizes for fuel and brake
systems (-3 to -6 AN). If you need adapters to get into the Porsche
lubrication system (large diameter), you might have to look elsewhere. I
adapted the factory steel oil cooler lines (the ones running toward the front)
to a front-mounted Earl's oil cooler with adapters from AJ-USA, San Diego, CA
(32mm?? -> AN-12/-16)... around $35 a piece. The other adapter I needed was to
adapt an oil tank fitting to a late model oil hose 25 -> 32mm??). I got this
one from Otto's in Venice, CA. There may be other sources closer to you. Hope
this helps.
