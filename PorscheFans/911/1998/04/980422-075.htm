Introduction and Official Delurk

Hello, fellow Pfans:

I have been a member of this list for about a year now although this is my
first post to the list as I just became a full-fledged member with the
purchase of my first Porsche - a 1982 SC Targa Black/Black.  While this was
not my first choice as to year or color (I'd been hunting for that illusive
"bargain" on an '87 Carrera in the Sacramento area), at 1/3 the price of
the Carrera, the SC I found was doable now rather than a "maybe someday"
dream, so begins the odyssey.

My love for these cars began at the age of eleven when I laid eyes on my
first Porsche - my sister's brand new '70 911T. I spent several days in the
back seat of that thing (!) in a round trip road trip from the SF bay area
to Disneyland and back.  My brother-in-law thought it odd that I was so
quiet most of the trip and finally asked why - I said I was busy "watching
the gauges".  I was hooked right then and there.  Insofar as it's taken 28
years to realize my dream, please pardon the foregoing blather.

Now on to the car!  It is a high mileage car (255k mi. on original engine!)
that was repainted (badly) six years ago. Car is perfectly straight - no
dents or dings, never wrecked.  Dash is a little warped, Targa seals a
little leaky (duh! Top and seals are original), and oh yeah, engine leaks a
little oil!!  In the pre-purchase inspection, a highly regarded local
P-mechanic (Frank of Frank's Automotive) said I should just "drive it as
is" for now and that I might get another 100k from the engine before
rebuild time.

My hope would be to drive it for a year, rebuild the engine and redo
cosmetically (paint and all seals) the year after that), allowing for any
"unexpected" mechanical work in the meantime (ya think?!!).  Hopefully, the
house cat will have expired prior to the paint job - creative solutions
welcomed.

soon!!!
