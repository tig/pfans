Here's a new question - not!

Anyone have experience with the "Keho" chip (Bruce calls it the "Keno" chip
in his excellent book) for a 3.2 Carrera? This is the chip available from
Europroducts for $198.

I was recently (and pleasantly) surprised to learn that my own mechanic
here in Clearwater, FL, Frank Eibell of Eibell Performance, helped design
the maps for the chip. He says it will make a small but noticeable
difference in the everyday drivability of the car (a 1988 Targa with 24,000
miles). I don't use the car on the track, just take it to work when it's
nice out and drive it on the weekends.

Frank showed me a fax from Bruce where (a few years ago) the Keho chip was
compared with everything else out there, and the Keho chip came out "first"
- with the caveat that Bruce found an exhaust change was the best "chip." I
don't want to do that at this point. And, of course, other chips have been
revised since then.

Frank is also an Autothority dealer, although that's a more expensive chip,
which he also  recommends because it can be reprogrammed if I were to make
changes to the motor. But for just a little "pick-me-up" he likes the Keho
chip. I would too, if I designed it. Plus, he'll put it in for free!

Anyone got any experiences with the Keho?
