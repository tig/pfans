It's easy to tell. If your oil temperature is over 200 you should have hot
oil flowing through the trombone.

It' s a standard part... very expensive to replace new, but available in
the used market.

That's a big understatment. Actually it will, but not very easily. The
threads are notorious for stripping. It was the first major job I did on my
old '76. Although we did it as carefully as possible, it took lots of heat
and even more muscle power. The proper tool is a big crowsfoot wrench that
can grab around the large fittings (36 mm?). 

If you do ruin the threads, I've seen a repair "kit" in Automotion or
Performance Products. there is a lot of thread depth on the valve. As for
repair, I'm not sure. The unit is a combination temperature operated valve
"supervised" by pressure, hence the two pistons and cylinders. One would
think there might be a repair kit for the internals, but I havn't seen one
I can remember. You can get at the pistons but if they're frozen I don't
know if repair would be possible.
