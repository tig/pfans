While you can't easily check the regulator itself, you don't have to. The
proof is in the pudding. It seems a classic case of a regulator failure. In
the '88 (just like my '86) the regulator is physically mounted on the rear
of the alternator. To test its function just hook up a voltmeter to thr
battery terminals (be careful, or better yet put a fuse inline with the
leads if you want to observe the meter inside the car). My regulator failed
by going through a cycle of "no-charge" to "max-charge." Interestingly, the
alternator light never went off while the regulator was not providing the
alternator field, but the brake warning light glowed very brightly when the
regulator went to "max-charge." (Remember, the idiot light and the brake
warning light are all connected.)

If your battery is overcharging you will observe a sustained voltage of
well over 14 volts at the battery, maybe as high as 16 volts (that's bad).
typically, a functioning regulator will maintain around 13.6-13.8 volts
when charging. Right after starting the charging voltage will exceed 14
volts until the battery voltage begins to recover.

Actually you can replace just the voltage regulator on the Marchal units.
As I said, its just an external module mounted at the rear of the unit. To
change the whole unit you have to loosen the fibreglass air shroud, remove
the fan shroud ring casting by loosening the steel ring. It's a tight fit
but you can get it out fairly easily if you maintain your patience.

Good luck
