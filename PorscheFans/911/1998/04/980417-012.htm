I think this would be a _terrible_ idea.

PorscheFans is an *international* list, and no one country's Porsche Club 
should take it over. There is far too much danger of a conflict of 
interests (especially as Porsche AG are currently making *very* strong 
moves to have every Porsche club in the world coming (to some extent) under 
the aegis of their marketing department.)

PorscheFans needs to retain its independence; this gives everyone on the 
list the ability to be totally honest and frank in their criticism (when 
appropriate) of anything from factory engineering decisions to aftermarket 
parts suppliers to Porsche Clubs to how other people drive their cars.

Indeed, if PCA did take over the list, would they have legal liability if 
someone posted an incorrect (or even unsafe) piece of advice [I have seen 
at least one *very* dangerous posting in the past regarding braking 
systems]? Would PCA have liability if someone said something libellous (and 
untrue) about a particular vendor? How about if that vendor was a big 
advertiser in Panorama?

I also can't imagine that most PCA members would be happy that their
membership subscription was being used to pay for a resource used primarily
by people who are not members of PCA. And please don't suggest that every
PFan outside the USA should have to join PCA as well as their own Porsche
club...

(For the record, although I live in the UK, I am a PCA (Germany region)
member as well as a PCGB one.)
