Re Rick Woodmansee's questions about the '75 model:

As for the thermal reactors, these spell certain death.  Bypass headers
used to be readily available; they were a bolt-on operation and easily
reversible (just in case you have a smog mechanic who actually knows
what a thermal reactor is).  You may still be able to get these
somewhere; otherwise, an aftermarket exhaust will bypass the problem. 
If tuned up, the car will run clean without thermal reactors, which were
a by-product of a certain point in time where Porsche and BMW were
trying to avoid having to use unleaded gas.  Both manufacturers used
them in '75--in retrospect a bad and shortsighted decision, but
hindsight is always 20-20.

If you've had good luck with a '77, the '75 is basically the same. 
Except that you should update your engine fan.  '75 came with an
11-blade fan.  In '76 the factory had the brilliant idea of cutting the
number of blades to five and having it spin twice as fast.  The solution
is to use the faster pulley ratio on the 11-blade fan.  Performance Aire
in Anaheim (714) 634-9184 sells updated fans on a trade-in basis, with a
new pulley riveted on and the whole thing refinished.

The only other caveat is that '75 models didn't have galvanized steel,
whereas '76 and later did.  If your car has never seen snow nor salt,
that's not a problem.  My guiding principle is that condition of the
body is everything; engine and suspension can always be upgraded.
