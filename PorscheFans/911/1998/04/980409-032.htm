My 944 had 12 point recess CV bolts but my '86 911 had hex (allen) recess
bolts, so it could be either.

Make sure that the bolt head recess isn't gummed up with oil/grease/dirt. If
it is, that could prevent the hex driver from seating to the bottom of the
recess. If any of the recesses are dirty, get a sharp tool like an awl and
scrape out the hole.

I use an impact wrench to break the bolts free. A hammer type impact wrench
would work well in this case. Like someone else mentioned, big vise grips
are the tool of choice if a bolt head is stripped.

Good Luck!

Brian,

I haven't done that job in a while, but if I remember correctly, the bolts
are not hex bolts, but 12 point star type bolts.  A hex socket will fit,
but will only be putting force on half the points and will strip much
easier.

I may be wrong on this as I can't remember for sure.  If so, someone please
correct me.  But, just in case, double check so you don't strip anymore.  I
know I have seen this before and I thought it was with those bolts.
