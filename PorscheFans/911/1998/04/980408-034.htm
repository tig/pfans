You are putting a '68 901 tranny in  your 1971T because its (911?)
tranny packed up and you got a deal on the '68.  You have concluded
that the CV s are different so you can't just bolt yours to the '68 output
flanges, and also that you can't put your 71 flanges into the '68.  So you
want to know if a 68 CV will just slide onto your 71 axle.

Alas, I am just a humble car owner, like you.  Not a guru like Bruce A
(and some of the other really knowledgeable folks who are kind enough
to enlighten us from time to time) who has had his hands on all of this
stuff over 30 and more years as a shop owner and mechanic, collected
samples, and made a profession of studying it.  While I am surprised to
hear that the various 901 stub axles won't interchange, I guess I
shouldn't be.  In fact, isn't your old tranny the "911?"  The one with the
pull clutch (which is why you had to deal with those issues)?  So at
least it makes some sort of sense that the splines changed in the
differential unit and the output shafts/flanges won't just pop in and out.  I
assume you confirmed that by pulling the stub axles from each box and
looking at them?

I tend to look at catalogs, Automotion's being the most convenient for me,
for some help in these parts compatibility matters.  These folks have to
know what parts fit what cars.  Their catalog would have one believe
that Cvs went from 65-68 (if converted from Nadella), from 69-71,  from
72-75, and from 75-84.  This is complicated by fact that maybe these
changes did not all coincide with model year changes (75, for instance). 
So you are certainly right in wondering.  

Like all else in life though, some cross checking is valuable.  Automotion
(in their 97 catalog anyway, and Tweeks also) has a typo on the bolt
sizes for CV s.  If they were to be believed, all CV s forever use 10mm
bolts, but they don't - the late 75-84s, anyway, with which I am only too
familiar, use 8mm bolts.  They know better (the bolt they show in a
picture is an 8mm bolt), but typos are the bane of everyone's existence.

They don't sell axles as such, but do sell CV and axle units.  There is a
footnote there which says the same "units" can be used from 69-74.  So
all CV s in those years should bolt up to the various flanges anyway
without any bolt size or pattern incompatibility.  I think this was the era of
4 10mm allen bolts and two fixed pins.  

But something changed in the 68/69 watershed.  Maybe List members
with older cars could go measure their spare CV s to see if we can build
up a collective data base.  There are shops out there with guys who
know all this stuff, of course.  But we do it yourselfers can't really ask
them to part with all of their knowledge.

You can help by contributing what your existing CV/axles measure out
to, at least the easy parts to get to to measure.

I have a couple of unusual ideas.  If the incompatibility is only in the
splines of the axle/CV, you could try to mix and match CV parts.  They
aren't separately purchasable, far as I know.  But if the ball sizes are the
same, should work.  Precision parts and all that.  Use your old inner race
with a new outer race.  However, I think some of these are thicker than
others, and that would call for careful observation to see if it would
work.  But I don't know if this would actually work. 

Secondly, it might be that you could take the differential out of your old
box and put it into the new box.  That way you could use your old
flanges (I think - at least the splines would mate up).  There is some semi
tricky adjusting involved of the side to side spacing, but it doesn't change
the pinion depth, and you would still be using the same ring gear from
your "new" tranny, which just bolts onto the differential assembly. 
However, I know even less of the minutia of the innards of 901/911
boxes, and there may be basic incompatibilities there.

It is doubtless because of the unknowns with these wild eyed ideas that
it seems folks simply change out the outter (wheel side) flanges and stub
axles to be compatible with the inner flanges, and get the axle to go with
all this.  Maybe you will reach this conclusion.

Here is my contribution to the collective axle spline/CV data base:
 the late 75-84 axles have 25 splines, with 27mm/25mm being the major
and minor diameters of the splined parts.
The CV s are similarly splined, of course, and are 100mm in diameter
with an 88mm bolt circle for 6 8mm bolts.  They are 32mm thick, and the
balls are 19mm.

Let's see what others can contribute.

How does this stack up against yours?
