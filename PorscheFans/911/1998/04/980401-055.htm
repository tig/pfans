My power tube was on the car when I bought it. I like the sound, which
is a little louder that the Lexus levels of the stock system, but way
below my 914 with a stock exhaust. In other words, the neighborhood
association won't be putting your house up for bids. 
Inside the car, I don't notice much, no resonance or such, and I don't
really hear the exhaust unless the windows are open.

As for power, who knows? Is the weight difference really 60 lbs or were
you exaggerating? More like 10 or 20 would be my guess. Please tell me
if I'm wrong.
