Vic Elford wrote a book in approximately 1992 on 911 high performance 
driving.  He won rallies and road races in a lot of different cars, many 
of which were not 911's.  It was his opinion that 911's were the best 
handling cars because of the rear weight bias, especially in poor-grip 
situations.

For those of us who are less talented than Vic Elford, that might not 
apply.  However, very few 911 owners drive their cars in dry conditions 
in ways where the "understeer to snap oversteer" is a problem.  Those 
who do should only be doing that on an autocross course or a racetrack.

In poor grip conditions such as rain or gravel, the rear weight bias 
does bite quite a few 911 owners.  That is why the Porsche Club has so 
many venues to learn to drive your 911 at its limits in safe 
environments.  Once you have taken a PCA driver's ed or two, or driving 
course, this will no longer be much of a risk for you.

Think of it this way.  You probably didn't appreciate a fine wine the 
first time you tried one.  Ripple tasted more like soda, and seemed 
better at first.  A BMW is more like what most people have driven 
before.  Please understand that a BMW M3 is a heckuva car, and can be a 
winner against 911's if enough money from sponsors is involved.  I'm not 
comparing BMW's to cheap wine, but making the point that it has 
more familiar handling characteristics, and is not as demanding to learn 
to drive it soon.

If you have not joined PCA, you should and you should get involved in 
the autocross, driver's education and driving courses in your region.  
You can sign up by phone at 703-922-9300.

I'm a satisfied member of PCA, with no financial ties to them.

Good luck in your bench racing!
