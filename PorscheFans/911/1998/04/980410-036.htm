I believe it's the '72s and '73s that were set up for regular leaded fuel
in the US, not the '74s.  I've owned both '72 and '73, and they're pretty
identical as far as fuel requirements go.  Since leaded fuel went away,
I've used unleaded mid-grade (the 89 octane gas they sell in many locations
that's between regular and premium) in both my previous '72 and my current
'73 911T.  I've had no problems.  I'm not sure that I couldn't use the
regular unleaded, but I've opted for the mid-grade.  The old argument you
used to hear was that once you'd run the car with leaded gas for a while,
the valves accumulated some sort of coating that was adequate for future
use.  I don't know if that's accurate or not, but I've not heard of anyone
having a problem with unleaded fuel.  I suspect newer valves have been
developed with unleaded fuel in mind.  I think the additives are not
necessary.

It probably depends on the condition of the car.  I've been lucky enough to
have good people work on my cars, and they have been no problem.  A lot
apparently depends on the condition of the mechanical fuel injection that
was on many of these cars.  If the MFI is bad, it's hard to keep them tuned
properly.  If it's good, they can be trouble-free, as mine have been.  If
you get the Bosch CIS fuel injection that they introduced halfway through
the '73 model year, it's apparently easier to deal with than the MFI.
