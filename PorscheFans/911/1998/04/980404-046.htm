Tory, I don't know where you bought the sway bar and U-tab kit, but
as i remember when I did this change on first my '76 then my '84, I welded
the U-tabs to the A-arms so that they were directly under the new sway
bar ends.

One warning - how are you mounting the sway bar to the body?  Just
bolting it to the sheet metal is a no-no; you'll tear up the body in no
time.  You need a reinforcing piece on the inside of the body.  I made
up a 3/16" steel plate the same outside dimension as the triangular
sway bar mount/bushing with a hole in the center for the bar to pass 
through.  I then drilled 3 holes at the corners and welded 3 bolts to the 
plate so they stick through the plate and through the 3 mounting holes
on the bushing mounting.  I placed this on the inside of the body and
bolted the new sway bar bushing/mount to the outside of this.  

I wrote up the procedure forthe Porsche Club of America magazine, and
they published it in Volume IX of their "Up-Fixin' der Porsche" technical
summary.

Good luck!

Okay sorry for the second posting. I had forgotten that a
co-worker has a 84 carerra. I went and looked at his suspension
and it's exactly the same as mine. So my thoughts are how is the
Welt meister bar suppose to be installed. Even the Automotion
catalog has this same bar (That I have) listed for like 74-89...
So I must be totally missing something..

Obviously still learning and will do more research before I hit
my Email mailer!
