<< Remember, the higher the DOT rating, the higher the performance. >>

<<<I do not believe this is exactly true.  The performance number that we, as
enthusiasts look for, is the dry boiling point and I believe that you can buy
the Ford Heavy Duty brake fluid or ATE blue or 200 or AP 550 (DOT 3/550 degree
F boiling point) or 600, all of which have higher dry boiling points than the
normal Pep Boys/KMart/Walmart/etc. brands, although they probably have the
same DOT numbers. >>>

You're right. I forgot about special cases such as the old Motul Racing fluid
that was classified at DOT3 because of its blue color, even tho the dry
boiling point was ~572. Unfortunately, it's wet boiling point was pretty low,
requiring frequent flushing. Their new Racing 600 in rated DOT4 , with a dry
BP of 585. I'm sure that there are others with similiar situations.
