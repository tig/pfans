911. Should anything be put on the Aeroquip fittings when tightening them 
up? Oil? Locktite? Any suggestions appreciated.>>

Yes, you can use nothing on the fittings and then check to make sure they
don't leak. If you're of this mind, add a bit of anti-sieze to the threads,
especially if you're connecting fittings of dissimilar metals (e.g. Al and
steel) to reduce electrolysis and corrosion, especially if you want to take
them apart later on. Don't use Teflon tape on the threads. Bits of tape can
dislodge and travel through the lube system and block or reduce a critical
lubrication passage. 

Engineer and race prep guru, Carroll Smith, in his "Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners and
Plumbing Handbook" recommends Loctite PST pipe sealant (not threadlocker).
JM2C (just my .02) toward the subject.
