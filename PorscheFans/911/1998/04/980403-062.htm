Hey all,

Well as always once I start something I usually don't quit till I
get it, or beat it, or until it's really late that if I don't stop
I'll break something..

Anyways, After a couple of hours of struggling I got both A-arms
off and am in the process of removing the stuck A-arm mounts and
installing the U-Tabs. Also while I have the car apart I'm
installing race bushings and cleaning the undercarriage of the
car.

Something else to note, although it's a 74 someone has applied
some undercoating to this car, probably when it was painted the
guards red that it is now..

Now the fun begins trying to get the bushings out!! ICk that looks
like it's going to be a 6 pack of pepsi project for sure. Anyways
enjoy your weekend, and well if your in The bay Area guess we get
to suffer through another bleak weekend.
