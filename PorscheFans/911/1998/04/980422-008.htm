Getting just a bit mystified as to why anybody would want to insult the 
intelligence of anybody driving (or worse, having bought) a C4, I would 
like to mention that I do (did) both and am very pleased with what I got.
Does this mean it can be improved ?  Sure - in fact I have replaced the 
whole suspension with the Ruf/ Bilstein setup and it now lets me hang the 
tail out just as I could with a 2.7 Carrera I used to drive (a long time 
ago) except that the "slow in, fast out" rule does not have to be adhered 
to as stringently as with the 2WD 2.7.
The fact is, thank God, we don't all think alike.  I suggest we quit this 
before it gets out of hand and go back to enjoying our (even if slightly 
different) cars !
Cheers
Kees

PS  Porsche dropped the viscous (used in the 993) approach when designing 
the 964 because it did not seem strong enough at the time.  It is simpler 
and cheaper than the 959 style electronic/ hydraulic setup, for sure - 
let's see how long they last ...
