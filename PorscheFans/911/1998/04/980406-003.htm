After all the wonderful news on how great my 88 Carrera is, I'd like to
ask the list for some insight in the following problem (if it is one) :

On start-up (cold), the car has a "jumping idle". Actually, there are
two to three bursts (needle jumps up and down between 500 and 1750 rpm)
and then idles at 1100 rpm. When warm, idle is at 900 rpm. Is this
normal ? 

I'm also getting used to checking the oil very regularly. Currently, it
is in the middle of the 1.75 liter, which means I could put 800 cc's in
there to top it off. What do I do, leave it or top it off ?

As I will be going to the track in two days, I'm also interested in
finding out what a good alignment would be for occasional (once a month
in season) track use. I will not be racing the car, but I'd like it to
handle decently and why not, slightly better than stock. I'm used to
running an aggressive alignment on the Miata, but that makes the car
very dicey in day-to-day use. Also, Porsche rubber is quite a bit more
expensive than the standard Miata sizes ... . All input welcomed.

On the same note, the car sits on Bridgestone Expedia S-01 all round
(205/55-16 front and 225/50-16 rear). How good are these for the same
occasional track use ? Any comparable (street) tire out there that is
better (I will be looking for replacements of the tires pretty soon) ?

Thanks,

Peter
