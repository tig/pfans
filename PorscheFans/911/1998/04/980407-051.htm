Could be any number of things but as I rule, I stay away from Dunlops. I
had a VW Jetta with D60 A2 tires on it...they were the noisiest, roughest,
shortest wearing tires I have ever owned. Put different tires on the car
and everything smoothed right out.

Have you checked the wheel bearings and their tightness, how about ball
joints? Does it seem to vibrate more at the rear or the front, under
accel or deceleration? Some tire shops will balance your wheels on the car
which also balances the brake rotors and everything else in line. I knew a
guy with a 930 who could never find the source of a vibration until he did
that. Turns out, something in the hub behind the rotor was out of balance.
Had the part balanced at a machine shop and the vibration went away.

Hope this helps...
