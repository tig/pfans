Rapidly changing family circumstances necessitate sale of my 1978 911SC
with approximately 150K miles.  Car is a black non-sunroof coupe with
black Recaro SRD driver and passenger seats.  During the 5.5 years I've
owned it, the car's had:
* Turbatrol front oil cooler replacing stock trombone (included)
* H1 headlights (stock included)
* Top-end rebuild only 5,000 miles ago to stock specification
* New Boge shocks
* Honest to goodness 1974 ducktail spoiler

This is not a concours car, but it is a very nice example.  I've updated
and pampered the car, but no longer have the opportunity to drive it
sufficiently.  Price is negotiable at this point, but I want the car to
go to a good home, where some fanatic will care for it as much as I
have.  If interested, please respond directly to driver8@ibm.net or call
(616) 383-1363.  Car is located in southwest Michigan.

Thanks,
Tim Krone
