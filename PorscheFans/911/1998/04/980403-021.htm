Thanks to the NUMEROUS members who responded to my problem.  Many different
solutions offered.  I appreciate the help.  I did locate the source of the
problem -- one of the nuts that holds the alternator in the shroud was missing
(the bottom one), so evidently the alternator was not exactly sitting in there
straight.  Months of centrifugal force must have finally caused the thing to
work its way loose.  I replaced the nut, and the thing spins free.

By the way, after spending THREE hours of my Sunday removing my alternator for
the third time in four years (first time the unit was bad, second time the
regulator was bad), let me say that either I am too stupid to see how to do
this job, or else Porsche REALLY made some stupid design mistakes on this
thing.  Two design flaws stand out:  1)  Why didn't they use quick connectors
or something on the wires, so that you can just unplug them, rather than
having to lean over into the cowling and work the fiberglass cover off the
back one nut, one quarter turn at a time in order to access the wire
connections?  In fact, why even make the cover bolt on?  Why not have it just
snap into place, rather than using the same six bolts that old the whole
alternator in the shroud?  2)  Why are the bolts that hold the alt and shroud
together allowed to turn freely?  If the nuts get stuck even a little bit, the
whole bolt turns, and then you can't get the nut tight.  Am I the only one
frustrated by these silly engineering failures that have cost countless
manhours over the years?  

Sorry.  Had to vent after this experience.  And this is one of the relatively
EASY jobs.  ---Dal
