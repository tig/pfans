Thanks for the search capabilities - I didn't find much on this ...

Amazing as this may sound ... my 88 Carrera Cab electric top Broke an
inch or two below the top (rear) edge of the window (driver side).  I am
talking about the main, metal structure (beam) which surrounds the top
and rear of the window.

It occured while I was taking the top down; almost straight up position;
after hearing amomentary lag in motor speed, followed by an awful
CRUNCH!  I was able to close and latch it ok, carefully guiding it shut.

As it sits now ... the top opens and closes normal but the drivers side
(rear) mechanism is not collapsing back while the passenger side
retracts normally.  I guess the drivers side jammed and the passenger
side continued causing adequate force to break the aluminum beam in
half!!! Does this actually happen?  The local dealer told me "it isn't
possible"??  

Anything on this one would be greatly appreciated.  What do I do?  Buy a
new beam?  Re and Re the top and aluminum weld it?  If so, will this
work and hold? I don't want to hear new frame as the dealer told me
something crazy, like $4,000.  The Top (material) is new.  I am in the
SFO - Bay Area (Burlingame).
