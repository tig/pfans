Hello all;
Returning today from a quick vacation to the coast....  car started to
run very rough...and then stopped cold. Wouldn't start.... waited  30
minutes viola, idle smooth ran like a top...to the first or only service
station on calif. highway 152, for the next 30 miles., MORE info, when
she quit running  opening the hood,  a little  smoke (electrical
smelling) was coming from the very tail end of the car, ie. between the
fly wheel and the rear end.  Any how filled up with gas, oil and  some
Techtron (sp?). Started back up  and up over Pacheo pass...for 9 miles,
same thing  rough running and then stopped cold.  $350.00 later she sits
in my driveway, 100  miles from the stoppage.   I have my own ideas what
the problem is but don't want to taint the response.... 

....but how hard is it to put an alternator in? ...and  oh my , $600 from
Tweeks or Performance products

thoughts ??
