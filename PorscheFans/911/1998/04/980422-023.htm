Here is an excerp that explains how some AWD systems work and WHY.  

http://www.eskimo.com/~eliot/awd.html

....Next came the torsen (stands for TORque SENsing) differential, which was
embraced by Audi in its second generation
     quattro system. Audi was approached by FF development (owners of the
VC patent) during development of the original
     quattro back in the late 1970's but the VC was rejected for reasons
that will become clear shortly. The torsen diff was
     invented by an American company (Gleason corp.) and had all the
advantages of the VC and none of its disadvantages.
     It is a fully mechanical device of worm gears and a worm wheel whose
workings are quite difficult to describe with
     words and probably beyond the scope of this article. However, the
torsen's characteristics is the issue that is of interest
     here. The torsen differential will split torque 50:50 in a no-slip
condition. However, when one axle slips, the torsen diff
     will send more torque to the axle with more grip, in other words, it
works in an exactly opposite way to a conventional
     diff. Torque splits of up to 80:20 are available, depending on the
pitch of the worm gears. And since it is a completely
     mechanical device, the locking action is instantaneous and progressive
as opposed to the VC, which has a very slight lag
     for the viscous fluid to "catch up". The torsen diff is thus more
sensitive to slip than the VC. Its locking action is also
     more progressive. (Porsche also rejected the VC in the 964 Carrera 4
because they felt that the VC was too difficult to
     control and that it had exponential rather than linear locking
characteristics.) 

     More importantly, the torsen does not lock or inhibit speed
differences under braking, thus allowing all 4 wheels to rotate
     independently at their own speeds when no power is applied. The torsen
diff only locks in a power application situation
     while the VC locks both during acceleration and braking. The torsen
has a torque sensing characteristic while the VC
     has a rotational sensing characteristic. 

     The VC's rotational sensing characteristic initially caused lots of
problems for the engineers. Anti lock braking systems
     rely almost entirely on speed differences between the 4 wheels to
detect a locking wheel. Thus, when the transmission
     tries to force 4 wheels to rotate at the same speed, it creates
serious difficulties for the ABS system. 

     The engineers had to use a variety of hacks to get around this
problem. Mitsubishi delayed ABS for a while for its first
     generation GSX, then finally decided to make ABS and rear VC limited
slip mutually exclusive options. The VW syncro
     system simply disconnected four wheel drive the moment the brake pedal
was stepped on via a secondary clutch. Most
     other vehicles using this implementation of VC have a very similar
disengage feature. The very successful World Rally
     Championship Lancia Delta Integrale even went as far as to apply a
little bit of power (via the engine computer) to
     reduce the drag of the VC when the brakes were applied! Some very
crude systems used a overrun device that is
     conceptually similar to the bicycle crank. This meant that while four
wheel drive was disengaged during braking it was
     also inoperative when reverse was engaged!

     The easiest hack was to reduce the effective viscosity of the fluid in
the coupling, so that the drag was reduced. This also
     meant that the VC's locking effectiveness was reduced, which is
probably quite acceptable for a vehicle intended
     primarily for paved roads. The VC's attraction is its simplicity and
cheapness, not its sophistication. 

     In the late 1980s Porsche and Mercedes were treading slowly and came
out with all wheel drive vehicles of unparalleled
     complexity. Mercedes' 4Matic system used the ABS sensors to determine
wheelspin. In the dry, the Benz was a rear
     wheel drive car. When the wheel sensors determined that the rear
wheels were spinning, a signal was sent to the
     computer to start engaging a hydraulically actuated multi plate clutch
to send power to the front wheels. Clutch
     engagement was progressively altered by the computer. When the
computer determined that even more traction was
     needed, a second clutch would start locking the rear diff. When the
brake pedal was pushed, both clutches disengaged
     instantly to allow ABS to work without interference. 

     The Mercedes 4Matic was a part time, automatically engaging four wheel
drive system. The reason given by Mercedes
     why they went to great pains to design a part-time four wheel drive
was that they did not want to upset their loyal
     clientele with a full-time four wheel drive, which because of the
driven front wheels, would "change the traditional feel of
     a Mercedes". One could also speculate that they were too proud to use
anything less complicated than Audi, which in
     the marketplace is considered "lower". In practice, the 4Matic system
worked no better and no worse than the other
     crop of full-time four wheel drives, but its cost and complexity made
it look bad. This original 4Matic system has been
     ditched and the latest 4WD Mercedes is now a full time system,
including the system to be used in the "M" class SUV.
     The Nissan Skyline GTR uses a system that is conceptually similar to
the original 4Matic. 

     Porsche used a similar system of locking clutches (though they are
implemented quite differently) as the Mercedes in the
     limited production, state of the art 959, but the center diff (which
is actually just a hydraulic clutch) was engaged at all
     times except when parking so that the steering would be easier to
turn. Torque split in the 959 varied with load and
     conditions. (via the progressive locking of the clutch). Unlike all
other implementations of all wheel drive, the 959's
     torque split varied under no slip conditions. i.e. In every other all
wheel drive system, the split is fixed until slip occurred,
     after which the various limited slip devices would begin to alter the
split. In the 959, the all wheel drive computer is fed
     information from many sources, including the throttle position,
steering angle, g force accelerometers and even the turbo
     boost gauge. In a straight line, under maximum acceleration, the
system will send up to 80% of the power (from a normal
     40 front/60 rear split) to the rear wheels, even if all 4 wheels are
turning at exactly the same speed. This was by far the
     most complex and sophisticated all wheel drive system ever built. 

     The 959 was followed by the 964 which was first introduced in 1989 as
the 911 Carerra 4. Porsche claimed that this
     was an evolution of the system used in the 959 and is even more
advanced. However, this was a fixed split system like
     all the others, with computer controlled clutches acting as limited
slip devices. The 964's trump card, however was that
     the speed sensors and accelerometers were used with the computer
controlled locking rear differential to cure the 911's
     natural tendency to oversteer if the throttle was suddenly lifted off
in a turn. The rear diff would start locking when the
     computer detected that oversteer was imminent. A locked rear diff
would induce understeer, which in turn countered the
     oversteer. Through the use of all wheel drive and smart differentials,
Porsche was able to tame a formerly unruly beast
     into a much more docile animal. This, according to their chief
engineer was their main reason for implementing all wheel
     drive in the 911, as the 911 with its rear biased weight distribution
is not in a real need of extra traction. 

     In 1993 Porsche updated the 911 with a brand new rear suspension. Even
the rear wheel drive version was tamed and
     thus the justification of using a highly complex computer controlled
all wheel drive system disappeared. The four wheel
     drive version of this 911 (alias the 993), has a much simpler, lighter
and cheaper part time automatically engaging VC
     system such as those found in the Golf syncro and most minivans.
However, the smart rear differential that fought the
     deadly oversteer was retained to quell any remaining tendency to
oversteer.
