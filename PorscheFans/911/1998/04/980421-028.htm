Thomas,

You can dial out some of the understeer characteristics with spring and
sway bar changes. The problem that is always present in a C2 is that when
accelerating through and then out of a corner, the front tires are asked
to do three things:

   1. Change the direction the car's momentum (steering).
   2. Provide traction through the turn.
   3. Accelerate the car.

A C2's front tires only have to do items 1 and 2. Adding item 3 adds just
enough work to cause an otherwise properly setup C4 to understeer,
especially in tight turns. Also, throttle steering is not quite as
effective with the C4 because you do not get as much weight transfer when
you lift off the throttle.

If you change the springs and sways bar enough to get rid of the
understeer problems in tight corners, the car ends up being to unstable in
high speed sweepers, even at autocross (~50 to 60 mph) speeds.

I assure you that I was able to drive around the problems of the 964 C4.
The issue here is that you don't have to with a C2...
