     "Hi Pfans:
     
     I watched with sadness that once again our beloved 911's got whipped 
     by BMWs in the GT3 class at Sebring. What's up with that? They have 
     been kicking our butts in that class for some time. Has anyone seen 
     any articles about the 996's chances against the M3's? Opinions 
     welcome. Ernie"
     
     Hi Ernie and P-Fans,
     
        Opinions.... I hate to say it, and probably will receive 
     innumerable attacks on this list (I'm a 914 owner) but after watching 
     the Technology wars for the last 5 years at Sebring and Daytona I 
     believe it still boils down to the undeniable....the 911's got the 
     engine in the wrong place....the car is fighting itself.  Spin after 
     spin after spin, those GT-3's are CONSTANTLY hitting the grass and 
     tires tail first.....Porsche basically admits this by designing the 
     GT-1 with mid-engine.  Years ago, the 911 was extremely competitive in 
     all venues because they were Porsche's.. absolutely optimized while 
     the competition was still learning how to race.  Well BMW has learned 
     how to make a front-engined car balance, Panoz has pushed that design 
     to the absolute extreme (really no room for people in the car). It 
     seems it is much easier to place weight in the rear of a front engined 
     car (and keep that engine/transmission well behind the front axle) 
     than it is to try to balance out a 911.
     
     If you are tempted to flame, please realize Ernie asked for Opinions.
     
     thanks
