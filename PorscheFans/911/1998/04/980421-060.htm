Would anyone offer feedback on their experiences with stiffer torsion
bars on a 74 or later 911. I have an 80 sc cpe that I am upgrading the
shocks and struts to Bilstein sport valving.  Also included in the work
is a turbo tie rod upgrade along with replacement of the sway bar rubber
bushings with new rubber.  I don not plan to go with harder bushing
compounds at this time(main concern is the hassle of cutting the old
bushings along with the possiblity of a harsh ride.

I am a new to this list and I am sure this has been discussed before.
Forgive this question if you have heard it a million times.

My car is a hard driven street car not a race car.  It is a play toy,
not a commute car.  I would like to improve the cornering capablity and
I am willing to give up SOME ride confort. (classic trade-off) 

This car came stock with a 19/24 mm nomial frt and rear sway bar (actual
sizes are 18.9mm and 24.1).  I am thinking of using a 21/27 combo which
would increases the spring stiffness by 49% in the front and 60% in the
rear.  Other possible combo would be a 22/28 setup which is a 80%
increase in spring stiffness for the front and a 85% increase in the
rear. This one is recommended by Bruce Anderson for "hi perormance"
applications.  I am not sure is he means "race car on race track" by
this.  

Has anyone done either of these combos?  How is the handling vs ride
trade-off.  I am planning on keeping the stock sway bars so I think that
I want to pick a combo that balances the incease in the front and rear.

I have heard from someone running a 21/26 combo which is a 49% increase
in the front and a 37% increase in the rear. Seems to me that this combo
should produce more oversteer all else being equal(tire type and
pressure, sway bar size, etc).

Any good or bad experiences with vendors or product quality would also
be helpful.  I am looking at Glen Sander bars right now but there are
many options.

Dare I even ask about hollow vs solid bars.  Some say that the hollow
ones "react faster".  I am not sure what that means since the bar is a
spring. It provides a linear amount of resistant to twist as a function
of the angle it is twisted through.

It is part of the sprung mass.  This includes the A- arm, tire and wheel
brake caliper and rotor,shock, tie rod, etc.  All this must weigh 50
lbs. (guessing).  Saving two pounds on the torsion bar seems like
a (2/50)=4% effect.  This is my crude thinking and maybe it wrong.

Can somebody set me straight.

Thanks,
Matt
