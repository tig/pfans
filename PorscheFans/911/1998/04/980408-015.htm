Hi Craig;

Actually, the Porsche BBS software you refer to in your note is up and
running very well at the Pelican Parts Web site.  We host their site for
them (nope, we are not an ISP, but they were having some difficulties with
their previous ISP and I have purchased bunches of parts from them) and the
BBS software you mention is outstanding.

Feel free to check it out the BBS at (http://www.pelicanparts.com/) and
follow the link to the BBS.  You will already find a 911, 914, 924/944, 356
areas that have been on line for sometime now.

BTW:  My company does computer market research and we are not affiliated
with either PelicanParts or Ultimate (the BBS software) in any way.  We are
just very pleased hostmasters/customers.
