It feels like it is dropping off at 7000 (the factory power curve says so
too).

Can anyone else with experience with the 2.4S and 2.7RS
comment on the relative performance of the engines? I was hoping the RS
would have a bit more upper RPM power, like a large version
of the 2.4S but it feels more like a larger E to me! I'm not sure if my
recently built RS is normal. Is Jeff Jensen(?)
still online, I think he had both models?

The RS is definately quicker but not sure how much of that
is due to the lighter weight. When my RS engine was in a heavier
car it was still able to pass my S at Lime rock but took most
of the straight (starting out at the same speed).

Yes

The 2.4S is not a great club racer against 3.2 and 3.6 cars in F
and the 968 which with M030 is REALLY fast. I could barely
pass a standard 968 at Lime Rock in my RS and we came onto the
straight at about the same speed.
The S is a lot lighter than other F cars so on a tight course 
it could make up some of the time that it loses on the straights.
