I replied to a message yesterday and the listserv auto-reply to me said
there were over 2500 list members. Today I sent two messages to the
list and
it replies that there are all of 157 members. So, if you didn't get this
message you need to resubscribe <grin>.

(part of the reason I am sending this is to see how many members the list
is
claiming to have at this point.)

Wow!  I can't tell you how encouraged I was to receive this message. 
I've been "bumped" from the list at least 6 times - basically every time
there has been a "burp" as you put it.  It's nice to know that for the first
time, the list farted, and I didn't get cast out with the waste gas!
