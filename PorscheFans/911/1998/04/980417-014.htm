Subject: Brake Warning Light

I've posted this before but considering the the odd problem with the
list I'd thought I'd try again. Whilst fiddling with the rear brakes I
seem to have set off the brake warning light it my 1980 930. It now
remains on whenever the car is started. The brakes are working fine and
it is definetly not the handbrake warning causing the light to remain
on. Is anyone aware of how this lamp can be reset.

Thanks

Shane"


Hi Shane

This is an oldie AND a goodie.  Disconnect your battery for about 10-20
seconds and then re-connect it and the light should go out (and stay
out).  If not then you DO have a brake problem or an electrical wiring
problem.

Also, do the sensible things like check the brake fluid; do
start-stop-start-stop driving (safely) until you think the brakes are
100% OK to the touch and make sure the car does not veer at all on each
start-stop - use "no hands" as well to check this; you could have them
checked properly by a P-Mechanic; research how long ago the brakes were
replaced and assess whether that's acceptable; any other safety check
you can think of (go through the Owner's Manual for hints on this part)
- after all, why waste a perfectly good Warning Light?

Give those brakes a good hard test.

Happy Touring
Paul
