Hello Dirk:

I am glad that you had such good luck with the XR-700.   If you noticed in my
posting,  I indicated that it did not work with my older 911.   I am sure that
they have to work well with some applications, as Crane sells a bunch of them.
Also, it is likely that your Bavaria has the XR-700 located under a nice,
clean, dry hood.   The Porsche's  911 engine deck lids are wide open to the
elements, and the air cooled engines run significantly hotter than the liquid
cooled engines.  Also, I remember reading somewhere, that when the (air
cooled) 911 engines are hot, they can expand by as much as 5-10mm.  (That
figure is to the best of my recollection)  If the 911 case studs have
difficulty enduring the high temperatures and thermal expansion rates of the
engine, then it is relatively certain that the delicate electronic diodes
(mounted on the engine/distributor) will be subject to malfuntion also.

I appreciate your positive feedback, and  I will pass on your successful
experience with the XR-700 installed on your BMW.


Thanks!
