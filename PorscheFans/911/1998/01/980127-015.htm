Kevin,

I had to replace my flywheel a few months ago and asked my wrench about
putting in a lightened one.  He said that for 2.7's and smaller it was
not a bad idea, but for my 3.0 all I would be doing is slipping my
clutch at green lights.  If I were racing a lot I might want to consider
it again, but that because my car is a daily driver I would wear my
clutch out a lot faster.  Seemed like a good argument at the time and
still kinda makes sense to me.  By the time I get to convert my SC to a
track car it will be ready for a new clutch anyway };)
