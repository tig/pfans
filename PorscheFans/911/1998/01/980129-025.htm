jim:

here's my general procedure for stuck fasteners (one that doesn't break 
loose on the second or third try):

1) put on some liquid wrench, whang on it with a metal hammer, or the 
nearest cheap wrench/screwdriver/whatever.  beating on the fastener will 
help break rust, scale, and other whatnot loose.

2) try a wrench on it.  sharp bursts of pressure are better than steady 
pressure, ie. don't lean on the thing with all your weight, but put some 
tension on it, then give it several quick, hard shoves.  slow steady 
pressure is a great way to round a bolt...

3) put tension on the wrench, hit it with a rubber mallet in the
direction you want it to turn (note that this is probably not the best
thing for the wrench, but i've had no problems so far...).

if that doesn't work...

repeat #1, then go do something else for ten or fifteen minutes, 
then repeat #2.

no luck?  repeat #1, wait an hour, whanging on it a couple times during 
the hour, then try #2 and even #3.

still no glory?  there are several paths to take:

for the desperate and impatient:  
4) grab the ugly old (but very tough) crescent wrench reserved for these
situations, snug it down on the fastener, put some tension on it, and
smack repeatedly with a deadblow hammer.  this runs the risk of doing
all sorts of damage, but is often quite effective.  you don't need to
hit the thing brutally hard--do it as if you're driving a smallish nail
into wood, not as if you're pounding railroad spikes.

for the patient and sensible:
5) repeat #1 every six or eight hours for the next day or so.  time heals 
all wounds...

for the foolhardy:
6) flame!  heat the fastener with a torch.  until it's red hot.  
really...  i've heard that this is quite effective for stuck exhuast 
nuts.  you've gotta be seriously desperate to start waving a torch around 
a car, given all that flammable grease and gasoline, and and and...

some other things to consider:

make sure you're using quality tools when you're putting a lot of force 
into things.  i feel a lot better about bearing down on a snap-on wrench 
than a tiawanese jc penney tool.  if the wrench is a little too big, or 
the allen key a little too small, you're going to round/strip the 
fastener, and then the game is a whole lot harder.

patience is better than force.  if you don't absolutely have to get the 
car on the road tomorrow, use tactics #5 and #2 only.  you stand a lot 
less chance of breaking something.

if you know the fastener is going to be a bitch (anything in the exhuast 
system), start the penetrating oil routine the day _before_ you actually 
start working.

if you do round a bolt, or you descend into total animal mode, find the 
biggest pipe wrench that will fit the space, snug it down good and tight, 
put a cheater bar on it, and go to town.  i've achieved some marvelous 
results with a 14" pipe wrench, and i know a guy whose got a 24" 
wrench...

and that's my dissertation on stuck fasteners.  Andy Warren will 
likely step forward to correct my errors, expand upon the good parts, and 
offer three excellent points i will wish i'd known while learning all 
this the hard way.
