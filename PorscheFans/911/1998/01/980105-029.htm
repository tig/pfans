Hi,

This morning I wrote about a water leak problem with my 85 coupe. I found
that the guys who replaced my windshield didn't seal it properly and as a
result when it rained a lot my dash flooded... that in turn caused my
instruments to fog up and water to run down the doors...

I need a new dash, non leather version...

The dealer is quoting me $400. I thought a couple of people got it for
less. Can someone point me in the right direction?

thanks,

Spiros

I hope you are not too offended by this amusing story (especially the Porsche
300SL).  (It's been shortened to remove lots of Compac propaganda/email me for
the entire story):

The Wall Street Journal via Dow Jones

  HOUSTON -- When Eckhard Pfeiffer's new all-wheel-drive turbo Porsche
suffered
a small scratch on its underside while in the dealer's care, the Compaq
Computer
Corp. chief demanded a new car. The Porsche dealer told him the waiting list
was
two years long.

  Mr. Pfeiffer wasn't bowed. Three days later, Porsche headquarters in
Stuttgart, Germany, called the dealer to say a new car was on its way.  Mr.
Pfeiffer had called the chief executive officer of Porsche himself.

  Despite his competitive intensity, Mr. Pfeiffer, 56 years old, is
considerably more private and publicity-shy than many of his high-tech
counterparts. He doesn't socialize with colleagues, though he is active in
Houston's charity society with his companion, socialite Carolyn Farb. An avid
sports fan and tennis player, Mr. Pfeiffer is most animated talking about his
beloved Porsches, including a newly acquired 1962 roadster version of the
gullwing classic 300SL.

  And like those cars, he expects his company to take fast curves at high
speeds. When delay after delay kept the company from building its core desktop
computers based on customer orders rather than on forecasts, Mr. Pfeiffer
exploded last May. "It's clear the organization doesn't have the right sense
of urgency," he declared to the assembled managers. Mr. Pfeiffer began
devoting two hours of his weekly top staff meeting to the project.
