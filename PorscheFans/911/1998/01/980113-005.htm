Two issues: tech question & items for
sale:

1) I've got a 73 911 (87 3.2 motor)
fitted with Wildwood brakes in the front

(cool carbons).  PROBLEM: when I'm
coming down hard on the brakes, even at
slow speeds, the left front wheel is
making a loud and distinct clunk, clunk,

clunk noise which then stops when I
release the brakes.  In addition, after
being at speed for some time (say 1-3
min @ roughly 90-100mph), smoke started
coming out of that same wheel.  I
proceeded to take the wheel off but
could not find anything that looked
obviously wrong.  Does anyone have any
ideas as to what may be the problem?  My

guess is bearings, but I just re-packed
them this August at a Bridgehampton DE
event.

2) Items for sale out of a 1973 911T in
VERY good condition:

a. Original 2.4 litre 911 engine - it's
pretty strong although it does have some

minor drips (really minor) on the cam
tower, the odometer read 69K when we
took it out.

b. Original seats (Recaro's I think) -
they're really nice w/ no rips or
cracks, anyone doing a restoration
should call me.

c. Fuchs 6x15 wheels w/ black centers
(and caps) and a set of new tires (I
forgot the tire type although they are
205 mm wide.  -- Sorry, but I keep the
car 60 miles from where I live so I
can't check.  They are very nice though.

Anyone interested should e-mail me or
give me a call @ (212) 929-0046.

E.J. Liotta

'73 (3.2) 911T
