Dan,

I enjoyed your explanation. I don't understand why Porsche would use
spacers on the TT though ?

I would guess that your larger tire diameter will give you lower RPM
because its the tire size and not the wheel size that counts when
calculating revs. I heard that Porsche engineers selected the front and
rear tire diameter on the 4WD models so-as to enhance stability as speed
increases, and that the 4WD system is sensitive to varying tire diameters.
Using the diameters for your stock S02 tires would indicate that the rears
turn more revs per mile or faster. I would guess that the opposite would
cause better stability (more revs/mile in front). I noticed that your new
wheel/tire setup reverses the size ratio. Have you heard anything about this ?
