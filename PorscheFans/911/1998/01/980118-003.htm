After having spent most of my waking moments thinking of the best way to
make my '76 911 quicker (most of these thoughts centering around
the engine compartment), I have come to the conclusion that changing
my ring and pinion ratio might be the best thing to do for the money.
The engine (2.7) is basically stock, with the exception of headers, and the
car weighs about 2350 lbs.  I am also running 275/40-17 tires in the
rear, so my tire diameter is quite a bit larger than the 225/50-15s I
ran in the pre-SC flare days.  My thinking is that rebuilding my 21 year
old 915 gearbox (which has never been open) and changing the R&P
would be cheaper and more "satisfying" than whatever I could do
to my engine (for the same amount of money).

One thing that I think would be nice to preserve in the event of a
switch to a 7:31 R&P is a tall 5th gear.  Is there something taller
than a 28:23 that would keep RPMs in a reasonable range for
extended interstate driving?  Does it even make sense to do
this?

Any comments appreciated,
