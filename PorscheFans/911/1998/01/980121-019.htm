Passive radar jammers do not work.  Do not waste your money on these units.
 Why they offer to pay your tickets is probably their gamble that they'll see
very few claims.

The only radar jammer presently available that works is an active unit:
 Phantom Technologies RCD.  Yes, it's $595.  But it does work.  I know a person
who has done road tests with a variety of units, and this is the only jammer
worth considering.

Regarding how law enforcement may react, I wouldn't flaunt it if I had one.
 Blasting by a trooper at an excessive rate will get you pulled over
regardless.  A radar gun is not necessary to get you a ticket for unsafe
driving.  IMO, don't mess with the cops.  If you run a jammer, be stealthy.

Hey y'all,
	I've seen these devices advertised in magazines that claim to
"confuse" radar and laser guns, so that no speed registers as you whir by
a cop.  Anybody know if these things work, or if they're worth the
$200-300 price?  The ad says the company will pay for any speeding tickets
you get for the first year while using the device.  I'd be interested to
hear what any state troopers on the list think.
Thanks,

Adnan
