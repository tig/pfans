>I am looking to add the 16"x8" Fuchs to the rear of my 1981 SC.  What is 
>the offset or part number for the 16x8 Fuchs as came originally on the 
>1988 and 1989 Carrera?  Also, was the 16x7 that came stock on the rear 
>of mine the same offset as the fronts on the 88 and 89 Carrera?

The offset on the "911" 8's is 10.6mm, the "944" 8's are 23.3mm.  The 944
wheels are more commonly sought after for racers of early 944's and for the
fronts of SC's and Carreras.  These were optional only on 944's through
'86,  in '87 all 944's went to the bigger offset (same as C2's and C4's)

I had not heard of the 944 offset being used on '89 911's but I suppose
it's possible.  Not sure why one would want the wheel sitting deeper into
the wheel well.

Your 7's will work fine on the front of your car.

I'm also looking for  a pair of  these wheels (10.6mm 8x16's) in "track"
condition, please let me know if you run across any at a reasonable price.
