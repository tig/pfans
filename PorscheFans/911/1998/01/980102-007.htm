Came across this item on Team.net autox list.  Reminds me of the 
gentleman, years ago, who had proposed legislation to require seat
belts on motorcycles.  Hard to believe that these people have any
control over my destiny.  Can you imagine it!!

LEGISLATIVE NOTICE

BILL TO PROHIBIT ALTERED SUSPENSIONS
APPROVED BY COLORADO REVIEW COMMITTEE

The Colorado Legislature's Transportation Legislation Review Committee
has
given preliminary approval to a draft bill that would prohibit any
person
from operating a motor vehicle on a public highway if the configuration
of
the vehicle has been altered from the original manufacturer's
specifications. This measure is specifically designed to ban vehicles
with
altered suspensions, but also pertains to tire or wheel size, body
height,
chassis configuration and steering system. Violators could face fines of
up
to $1,000.
SEMA supports reasonable and relevant safety laws regulations at both
the
state and federal level and supports the model raised vehicle regulation
recommended by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.
Like some other states, however, Colorado appears poised to impose
unnecessarily restrictive and burdensome vehicle suspension requirements
without substantiating its claim that the legislation will improve
highway
safety or provide other tangible benefits. In addition, it effectively
defers to the vehicle manufacturers to set the standards.
While this bill has not been formally introduced and Review Committee
approval does not ensure passage, we are extremely concerned that action
on
the legislation may become an immediate priority when the legislature
reconvenes in January, 1998. We will be forwarding additional
information on
this important bill in the near future. In the meantime, please feel
free to
make copies of this notice for distribution to all interested parties.
For more information please contact stevem@sema.org.

Don't know where you're located, but there's a guy in Bordentown, NJ that is
really good with Targa tops. He rebuilds and recovers them and, it's been my
experience that he is very helpful with tops even if it's not a full rebuild
or recover project. He has used components and is reasonable. He is Dan
Petchel and can be reached at609-298-7040

Retired 'n drivin' my 911

PS-a tip on the list I found very helpful was to get an expandable round
curtain rod; mount it between the front (leather covered) bar and the rear. A
clip was poping out from the front bar when I hit bumps-the rod is just enough
tension to eliminate that. I used a apeice of plastic to protect the leather
on the front where the curtain rod is in contact with the leather. I covered
the plastic with black electrical tape and painted dthe curtain rod with flat
black paint-looks like it belongs.

I am thinking about "big red" calipers for my 944TS. Will they take me
out of my stock class? If I "run a chip", this will def'n change my
class, but would adding the calipers at that point make any difference?

From what I have observed, the rules in PCA racing only serve to waste good
trees.  I was recently at Road Atlanta following a black 944T with Black
Forest Logos.  I could catch up in the turns leading to turn 7 only to be
blown away on the back straight.  The irony, the 944T had a big yellow 'E' on
it.  I was driving a not so stock RSA.  There is no way that a legal 'E' 944T
could put that much distance on me.

Paint them black, run whatever class your conscience allows and have fun.  You
won't be alone!
