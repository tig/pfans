I tired to mark spring plate location and eccentric bolts as described below 
but had no luck.  Couldn't bring my self to trust either due to play I found 
in these parts.
What I have been doing (and I've done it many times to experiment with ride 
height and alignment settings):
-Jack up, remove wheel and shock.
-Measure camber against disk using camber guage.
-Measure toe buy measuring tape from t bar to center of axle bolt - I'd be 
interested in hearing comments on this cause my reasoning is that toe is 
directly related to this distance - axle is 'radius' which is located by the 
eccentric bolt.
-Disconnect bannana arm from spring plate (remove ecc bolts and other 2 
bolts). Spring plate will drop cause tension removed.
-Measure ride height by measuring distance from floor to end of spring plate 
(if spring plate is against the stop bolt, remove it first then measure)
-Remove t bar cover.
-Remove t bar and relocate to new setting.  Ride height will change 3/4 of the 
amount the end of the spring plate is raised or lowered because it constitues 
3/4 of the distance from t bar to axle.  I'm using stock t bars so changing to 
bigger bars will require some guessing here.
-After banana arm re-connected, reset toe and camber using the original 
measurements.

Make sense?

Joe

Colin,

Changing shocks and t-bars for a late-model Carrera is basically the same=
=20
procedure as all previous years.  The only procedure which might require=20
realignment is replacing the rear t-bars, which requires disassembly of=20
virtually the entire rear suspension.

If you carefully mark the locations of the spring plates (use a=20
contrasting crayon, etc. and draw along the upper edge of the plate=20
before removing) AND note the locations of the camber/toe eccentric=20
bolts, you may be able to avoid realignment.

Front end: no problem.  The t-bars are removed out the back end of the=20
A-Arms...again, note the location of the threaded adjuster bolt before=20
removing, as well as the location of the upper strut mount in the body=20
openings.

Plan to spend a full weekend (12+ hours) to do bars and shocks, "IF"=20
nothing else is broken or breaks in the process.
