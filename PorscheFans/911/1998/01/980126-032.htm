Goodmorning from California,

A non interneted friend is looking at a '77 911S. I have a couple of
questions to ask on his behalf. He wants the car for street use.

1. What's the best wheel/tyre combo he can go with? I know there's a
European set up, smaller rim diameter, thicker tyre profile. Any
experience with that? Can he fit 8", or even 9" in the back. The car has
no flares...

2. He found a 3.2 with 70K miles on it. They're asking $6500 in California
(San Diego), I think it's high, what do you guys think?

3. We took the car for a test drive yesterday. When I drove it the
steering felt loose to me, meaning there was a small dead spot in the
middle. Turned left, turned right, the car went straight. Is something
worn, can this be fixed, or is it just how they built them then?

thank you in advance for any input,

Spiros
