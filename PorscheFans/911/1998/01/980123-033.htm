I welcome thoughts from anyone who has successfully solved a persistent =
oil leak like the one I have with my 3.3L 911 race engine.  I have a =
small, but continuous oil leak at the interface between the crankshaft =
and the main oil seal (flywheel end).  The oil does not appear for the =
first 10 minutes of engine running, but will then appear when the engine =
is stopped or runs longer.   The leak will drop a tablespoon of oil from =
the transmission/engine seam after 10 minutes of running.
I have replaced the seal four times (two brands of seal) placing them at =
various depths into the case.  I even installed a "speedi-sleeve" on the =
crank the last time all to no avail.   The leak is not at the seal/case =
interface, but rather is at the crank/seal interface.=20
I tore the engine down completely to recheck internals; the crank has no =
measurable runout, the journals are within spec although on the small =
size of the spec, main bearing bores are within spec, and two sets of =
new std bearings have been used.  The crank was polished and a 3.2 =
carrera oil pump was installed at the first rebuild, due to a rod =
failure.  The case is a '78 3.0 L with 100mm P+Cs.     =20
The engine runs very strong, but leaked from the beginning so after 10 =
hours I tore it down and started over with the same result.
   =20
I'm getting a little tired of pullng the engine so ideas are welcome?
Thanks,  Tom
