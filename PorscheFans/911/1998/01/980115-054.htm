You guys talking about heater blowers (nonfunctioning kind on engine)
and defroster blowers might want to take a look at:

http://macmyler.engr.ucf.edu/Poor_Mans_Porsche.html

Harley has a place on this FAQ about the heating/vent system.  Knowing
which levers do what (not as easy as one would think, though) is the
starting place for all heater knowledge and lore.  Someone also posted a
wonderful explanation of how Porsche color coded those levers (red =
heat, blue = fresh air) and the hints the triangle symbols give (like up and
down).  Maybe he'll repost (actually, rerepost). 

Are you perhaps calling the fresh air blower (turned on and speed
controlled by a blue lever on the top of the stack on the dash, and
located in the front trunk just in front of the dash) the defroster blower? 
This isn't designed to defrost (although it can do a decent job of
defogging mist), and doesn't drag heat up from the engine.

For defrost (and general cabin heat), fix the blower on the engine (take
to a decent auto electric shop, maybe use as core trade on a rebuilt one)
after making sure it is broken (i.e., you can measure 12 volts at one of
the prongs of the 2 prong connector attaching this motor to the rest of
the car close to it on top of the engine, and the other one goes to
ground).  As a temporary fix, jury rig a bypass.  The engine fan air blown
into the blower will heat the passenger compartment, just not as well as
when boosted along by the blower motor.  In fact, you should get some
hot air this way just by pulling the heater levers up, functioning blower
motor or not.
