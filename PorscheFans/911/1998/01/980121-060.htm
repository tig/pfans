Hi, can you help?

I mistakingly bought a sporto from a dodgy car salesman, I have however
fallen in love with this car and don't want to part with it. So now I'm
going to convert it to a manual. 5 speed preferably. With the help of a
mechanically minded friend of mine we are going to do this ourselfs. 

I intend to replace the parts and then give it to a porsche dealer to fine
tune - please advise?

What I need is a step by step manual or comprehensive guide to do this. -can
anyone help?

Also I would love to hear your stories if you have tried this before.

When I have finished I will compile a work book history (with photos) of
problems etc and submit it PCA for publishing on their site.

Thanks for your help..........I  await your replies.

Dom
