Sometime ago there was discussion about this on 914 list and I dug =

up from my own archives what I wrote then.

Noted some discussion regarding different thread repair / strenghtening
used in Al-parts. We have repaired spark plug threads in our drag race =

engine, solid billet heads (WAR), with both HeliCoil and Wurth "sleeves".=
 =

I don't know what is the correct name for these. These Wurth things are =

easy to do as the tap has first a regular spark plug thread that guides =

the tap straight. Then the hols is re-threaded to a new, bigger diameter.=
 =

A sleeve is mounted with a special tap that "knurles" or expand this =

sleeve to the new threads. I feel these are better than helicoil as it ha=
s =

the guide in tap and there is a small shoulder witch come flush to spark =

plug sealing surface. Conical seal is something else.

Now the reason for this posting, we run our DR engine with methanol and =

this don't color the plug, also the run is short abt. 6 sec, so no time f=
or
that. =

We check the cyl. temperature by reading how the coating of plug is burne=
d =

off, yes we have a lot of plugs used only for one run, start + 6sec. run.=


When a sparkplug thread is repaired with any method, except welding, the =

heat transfer is disturbed and the heat is not tranferred off the plug as=

from =

an "original" thread =3D plug don't cool, your plug run hotter and the
reading =

of plug is not accurate.

I would think this is somewhat important in an aircooled engine and perha=
ps

there is a risk of detonation when "regular heat range" plug is used in a=
 =

non-welded repaired spark plug threa.

To sum this long story, try to repair original thread, use a spark plug
thread
repair tap, or You can make one by making a cut with saw in a regular plu=
g.
File the cut smooth, and run this in threads. The cut in plug will clean
threads,
and junk can collect in the groove. Clean often while doing this.

Regarding valve adjustment, somebody on this list made a valid comment of=

NOT remowing spark plugs before valve adjustment. This is so possible dir=
t
can not fall down from plug end between exh. seat & valve and give a fals=
e =

reading of valve clearance.

Porsche to my knowledge do not recommend using antisize in plug threads,
my experience say, use O2 sensor safe stuff. =


Sorry for long posting
