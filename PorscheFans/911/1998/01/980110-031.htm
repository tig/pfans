Hi All, 

After reading the threads on the BFG R1's I thought great, I will buy
these since I want a good sticky tire for the street and I dont plan on
rain driving. Reason being my race buddy just spent $1100.00 for very
good street tires (cant remember brand) and I know I want the same after
driving his car, I think they where BFG's for the street ??
So I went to him and ask, why spend a grand when for what half that he
could have very sticky tires (R1's) "He said" that R1's arent good for
the street because they are too soft and they tend to throw up sticky
rubber and every rock off the street that you run over and will ruin
your paint. I know every one has an option, but his his a good one ??
There is no way I really want to risk that, I know rock chips happen, by
why speed the process up ???
Just wondering out loud..............

Don

Anyone know about a problem 993s may have with steering bushing deterioration
at about 15k miles?

and what do they mean by "safely" (to car or worker)?
=================================================

Dan

993s have two jack points near each rear wheel, (that makes 6 total, I guess)
one for lifts and one for jacks, I think.  The owner's manual shows which
point is for which.  Previous 911s had a square hole in the side of each
rocker panel, covered by a black plastic plug you may have noticed about 1
foot in front of each rear wheel.  We used to stick the tongue of a special
OEM screw jack into that hole to jack it, or use swing arm points for lifting
by floor jacks, or the bottom of the engine.  993 engine mounts have liquid in
them so the car can't be jacked from the engine (or is not supposed to be).
The Weissach LSA axle cannot be used as a jack point, either.

Too many mechanics do not know about the engine mount and axle limitations and
can cause severe damage trying to do it their way (all the while swearing to
you that they know what they're doing).  I usually have the appropriate page
of my owner's manual handy and stand there with it while they maneuver the
lift arms beneath the car.  It is therefore unsafe to the worker because if
they bend a suspension arm after being so audacious, the 993 owner may hurt
them :-)

Dave, might suggest calling Dave's Auto at 412/351-0725 (Pittsburgh area)
 He has a good selection of stuff from different Porsches, and I have found
his prices to be reasonable.

One of the few things missing from the '88 Carrera that I recently
purchased is the car's toolkit. If any of you have one that you
would be willing to sell (or if you can reccomend a good source),
drop me an email. Used is great as long as it's complete. TIA.

Two ideas:

1) What do you mean by "actual speed"?  If you're using the speedo 
reading, this is your problem.  Porsche speedos in my experience are off 
by approx. 10%  (true for my old '76 and '84; present 993 is dead right).

Drive on an interstate highway at 60 MPH, measure your time between
mile markeers with a stopwatch; should take exactly 60 seconds.  Every 
second you're off (up to approx. 5 seconds) equals just about 1 MPH.

2) What size tires are you using?  Are they the fractory recommended
size?

I have a question about my 87 930.  The actual speed vs rpm does not
match the speed vs rpm chart in my owners manual.  RPM is higher than
perdicted by the chart for any given speed.  My 944 turbo did the same
thing.  I know there is some slip involved but the difference is over
10%.  Do all 911 and 944 behave this way??
thanks for the help,     vichang4@bellsouth.net

I personally think it's going overboard, especially at the price they want,
as I remember.  I have jacked my 993 up about 20 times since getting
it in early '96 (changing pads, rotors, shocks/struts, wheels, etc.) with
no trouble.  I use a floor jack with a large pad face (NOT one of these el-
cheapo jacks with a approx. 2" diam. pad face).  For support I put a 
$2 hockey puck in the pad face; have not had a problem (yet) and car 
is stable and have not damaged anything.

Hello P-fans,

The AJ-USA Christmas supplement lists a 993 Jack Pad.  In the
description they describe "Due to unique jack points the
993 is difficult to safely lift the vehicle with a floor jack
or shop lift. Our tool is an answer to the problem ...".

Can anyone elaborate on this description?  My 993 is my first
911, so I have no prior experience.  What do they mean by "unique"
and what do they mean by "safely" (to car or worker)?
