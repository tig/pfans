I've recently moved from Boca Raton, FL to Boston, MA (Yes, I'm nuts)
and now I need to sell my wheels to buy a house. In FL the priorities
were car, wife, house, job, etc..., but up here in Boston everything
is different. The new priorities, as I understand them, are house,
wife, job, car, etc... These new priorities, as dictated by some
unknown authority, combined with the fact that houses cost double
what they did in FL (unfortunately, my salary didn't double) have
forced me to this:

for sale $33900
'90 C2 Cab White with navy blue leather and top
Brand new ($3500) clutch and flywheel
New tires
Power Seats
No accidents,dents or dings
Always garaged and covered
Have all records

People (who don't know Porsches) are always asking me if it is new.

A very nice car!

It's currently in FL, but I may have it shipped to Boston soon.
Can E-mail photos and will gladly set up an appointment to
meet in FL (I'm freezin' up here).
