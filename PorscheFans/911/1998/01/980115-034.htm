   James:
   
   Yes, you can DIY but it depends on your level of mechanical ability.
   If you're comfortable doing things like struts and brakes, it's only
   nuts
   and bolts.   I did it myself for the first time last winter and wrote
   up a
   detailed procedure since the factory manuals and Haynes were lacking.
   See my Torsion Bar FAQ at PCA/Central PA Region website:
   http://home.ptd.net/~psprechr/  under Tech Info.   
    
   The spacers are added to space the steering rack to its original
   position
   and prevent bump steer.  You will need to get the car aligned.
   
   I use Black Again and Meguiar's #42 on my targa and other rubber
   parts.
   
   All the usual disclaimers...
