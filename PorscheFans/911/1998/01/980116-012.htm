Hi Fans,

I have a 20% off coupon (good for one week) for Porsche parts from Tweeks
and was scanning my latest catalog for some items.  I noticed that at the
bottom of every page was a disclamer that the parts are not approved by
Porsche and may void any warrantees.

Now, my car is an '80 SC and obviously not under any warrantee, but I am
wondering  if these parts are up to standards.  Everything I looked at said
"OE Style" whereas my Perf. Products catalog said "OEM".

I have ordered previously from Tweeks and have been happy with what I got,
but I was not buying hard parts, just stuff like fog light lenses, etc.

Anybody have any comments or experience on this?  I would like to use the
coupon, but it is not worth it to me if the parts are substandard.

Also, they advertise a page with stainless steel heat exchangers, but they
don't specifically say SSI.  Are they really SSI or are they just stainless
exchangers?  The Perf. Products catalog specifically says SSI.

Maybe I should just wait for my Perf. Products 20% off sale?
