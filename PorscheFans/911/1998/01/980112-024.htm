Does anyone know if the H4's come in right or left ?
By looking at the lenses's it would appear that there
could be a left and a right do to the fact that the side of the lense
is angled up and if both lights were the same you would have something
like /-----/ instead of something like \-----/ know what i mean.....
Some one with the Hella h4's please come to my rescue so that the entire
list dosen't think bad thoughts and stop responding to my pittly needs......
Also anyone installed a relay in the wiring and have any tips, which relay to
get 
where to put it etc.
I'm running the 80/100's and can't keep dimmer switches from smoking.....
