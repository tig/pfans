<<I am in the process of finding my first Porsche.  Ive found a 911
turbo
(930?) 1976 with 3.0 engine (standard) needs tires and alternator but
runs.
The car is being auctioned and I probably will not be able to drive.  It
has
about 96,000 miles. >>

Ben,
Unless you are able to purchase this car in the low teens I would RUN
away from it.  The mileage on the car is vey high, and 76 is not the
best year for 930's.  You would do much better with a 79 or later car
(not to insult 76 & 77 owners).  Unless you get the car inspected
thoroughly and are sure that the alternator and tires are all that's
needed I would be leary of the car as well.  If price is any concern at
all I may recommend maybe a non-turbo 911.  They can be very expensive
to maintain (not b/c the yare unreliable, but b/c parts are expensive). 
If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to call me.  I
may also be able to help you find a nice 930 via my locating services. 
I'll send you the info in a seperate E-mail if you'll write me back with
your address.
