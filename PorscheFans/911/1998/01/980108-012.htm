Wil is right here. Red Lines GL5 lubricants are the 75W90, 75W90NS and
80W140 as well as probably some of their shockproof gear oils. If you don't
have a clutch type limited slip (i.e. factory) you'd want to run 75W90NS as
it doesn't have the friction modifiers (friction modifiers make the oil more
slippery) that the 75W90 does. 

(A bit of a note here, transaxles make it kind of tough on a gear oil.
Synchro's like something not too slippery for easy engagement. Differentials
like something real slippery. Not a problem on cars that have seperate units
but transaxles share the same oil.)

If you do have a clutch type limited slip you would want to run the 75W90.
The friction modifier in this oil will prevent you limited slip from
"chattering". This chattering is caused by the clutches grabbing and the
friction modifier makes them slip a bit on engagement. Your probably
thinking "hey, I don't want my limited slip clutches slipping, this can't be
good for  good lockup". Right you would be and that's the reason many racers
will put up with the chatter to get good lockup. You can use this same
reasoning on a limited slip car that is beginning to show wear on the
clutches and inadequate lockup. Use of the 75W90NS in these cars would allow
the worn our limited slip to work better. If you have a limited slip car and
you REALLY want to get the most out of your unit without chatter you could
use the 75W90NS and add Red Lines seperate friction modifier. You would
basically add ONLY enough to eliminate the chatter. Red Line obviously has
to take an educated guess on how much modifier to add in the 75W90. You
could add only enough for your application and custom tune your gear oil!
