I am considering buying a 1987 911 Carrera Targa. It has the G50 trans
and hydraulic clutch. It's at a reputable dealer and had one previous
owner, all service records are available. The dealer says that every-
thing is stock on the car, including champagne color paint. He also 
saus that all fenders are original, never been wrecked. It is a 
california car, so rust shouldn't be a problem. I have never bought a 
porsche, so I'm wondering if anyone can give me some advice. Here's a 
couple of things I'm wondering about:

  - The car has 87k miles. what would be the expected lifetime of
    a 3.2L motronic? I like the car a lot, but don't want to do a 
    rebuild in the near future. Any idea what the range of miles
    for rebuilds on these things (ie as early as, or at late as).
    I am willing to rebuild later, but don't want to for a few
    years (it will be a daily driver). 

  - The price tag is just under $25k. Does that sound reasonable?
    I'm probably paying a premium buying it at a dealer, but I'm
    more comfortable buying from a reputable dealer than privately.
    I also think I can get financed easier when arranged through 
    a dealer. 

  - I'm wondering how I can verify that everything is stock and
    the fenders are original. Should I get it checked out by 
    another mechanic even though it's being bought by a porsche
    specialist? 

  - Anything special I need to know about this year/model 911?
    Were there problems with chain guards in 1987?

  - I'm new to the USA and not very familiar with the DOT or 
    DMV rules and regs. Is it possible to get info on the car
    from these sources via VIN? I'm in california. Any way 
    to find out accident records and such?

  - How hard is it to check the numbers on this car? Are the 
    engine and chassis numbers easily accessible? Any idea where
    I can find them?

  - Any recommendation on dealers or mechanics in the northen
    california area? (peferably SF/San Jose area)?

TIA,
Doug [Falling in love with an 87 targa ...]
