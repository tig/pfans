Larry,
I only have 2 nites driving home on mine (but have a yr & half on std.
lights to compare to) and I personally think they're great. Like
anything else it's a personal thing whether it's worth it to you. My car
is a daily driver w/a fair amount of night driving (here in Wisconsin
'deer country') so it was a fairly easy decision for me.
Side to side they illuminate much more. Color of everything they
illuminate seems to be much brighter. I think they fix any deficensies
the std. low beams have.
Cost -- I've seen them as low as 1400 through some mail order but
availability has been a problem. I paid the 1600 through the dlr and had
them put them in (allow 2-3 hrs install time on top of 1600).  Mine took
a bit longer since wiring is a bit crouded up their for me -- Strosek
driving lights & radar jammer in close proximity. 
Hope this helps, good luck.              Gregg  84 944
