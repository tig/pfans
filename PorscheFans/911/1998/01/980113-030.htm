I wasn't at the show but I drove a 996 a few months ago in Europe. Great
car, very refined, not a 911 though... the primitive feel is long gone,
I'd say since '89...

With the whole car market going "back to the roots" I'm sure we'll see a
911 that resembles the glory that was, maybe not for a couple of years,
but I'm sure we'll see it... I hope... I think you'll also see the price
of used ones going up, SC's, and 84's through 89's. You'll be surprised
how many people I've met that are nostalgic about the older 911 feel that
Porsche moved away from...

my 2c worth,

Spiros
