Brian,

No trick that I can recall.  Just long and narrow arms.

Seriously, I agree it's not easy, but I don't remember using special
tools, nor remove any additional equipment.  In general, I move the
AC compressor out of the way, then simply use a standard spark plug
socket and a 3" extension.

Ah, maybe that's it.  If you try anything longer than a 3" extension,
you
may run out ot room... anything less will be too short to reach the
plug.
So, you need a 3 inch extension, and the length of the extension shall
be 3.  The extension length shall not be 2, lest ye add an additional
extension of 1.  A 5 inch extension is dead out.  (Sorry, I was just
watching Monty Python's Holy Grail)

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
