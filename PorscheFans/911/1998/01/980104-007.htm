Dear Auto Club Members:

We noticed your site on the internet and decided to drop you a few lines. Our company manufactures a practical, unique lift which enables the operator to tilt the whole car (engine, trans and all) on 90 degree angle for easy access to its underside. You can imagine what benefits our jig offers to car restorers especially. Check out our web site at:

http://www.kars.com/showcase/mps/

The cost of the whole unit is only $650.00. It does not require any power source and is maintenance free. If you have an access to engine hoist, chain fall, or any other lift device, the tilting is practically a one man operation. US and Canadian community colleges use our Auto Cradle in their automechanics departments. If seventeen year old students can do it, so can you..

Being myself a restoration nut myself, I have use the auto cradle many times when welding in new floors in the old Mercedes cars. This most dreaded procedure becomes actually an enjoyable task thanks to the fact that the car is positioned on 90 degree angle. Because everything is exposed now, there is not a tendency to cut corners any more!

I like to use it when a MIG welding is required on floors covered with old rust proofing material.. 

The cleaning of the surfaces before welding is easy when the car is positioned sideways. Forming new fuel & brake lines is no longer knuckle bruising job.. See the brand new mercedes diesel in attached photo positioned on our lift..

Contact us if interested.

HAPPY MILES IN 1998 !!
