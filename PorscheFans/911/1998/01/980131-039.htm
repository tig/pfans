Subject:  RE:  Chain tensioners

Chet,
I don't know if you got my response to your question on Porschefans. It was a
little garbled from my word processor (or something). Here's an update.

I took off the left side chain box and discovered the tensioner was "soft",
meaning it was not pressurized with engine oil and I could easily push the
tensioner plunger inward.  I was curious to see if I could repair it since it
only has a few (40 miles) on it and I can't return it because I purchased the
kit a few years ago. You know how projects progress don't you? In addition, I
didn't want to spend any more tensioner dollars if I didn't really have to
after spending $300+ already. Anyway, I pulled the old tensioner off and took
it apart. 

According to Bruce Anderson's technical column in Feb. '98, Excellence
Magazine, there is an inlet check valve in the tensioner that's supposed to
open at 2.9 psi. After disassembling the tensioner and inspecting the parts
(everything was like new. Duh, I knew that), I shot some compressed air in the
inlet port and heard the check valve open and then close when air pressure was
off. However, I couldn't think of any way to accurately meter 2-3 psi air
pressure to test if the check valve was opening at the correct pressure.
There was always a slight chance the tensioner was okay but the inlet oil
pressure (for whatever reason) was not up to at least 3 psi. due to line
blockage or whatever.

What I did was reinstall the reassembled tensioner with its oil line (loose)
and WITHOUT the cam box cover. Then I grounded the secondary wire of the
ignition coil and bled air out of the lines by cranking the engine over until
oil spurted out of the oil line. After tightening the fitting I continued to
crank and see if oil pressure was having any effect on the plunger.... it
should normally be difficult to push the plunger inward. Well, it now worked.
Tensioner plunger is now as hard as a presidential welcoming party for
interns. Perhaps the compressed air exercised the check valve enough so it now
works okay. Maybe it's only temporary and waiting to expire once it gets out
of service range of my Auto Club card.

BTW, before you get this far and you suspect the timing chains are very worn,
check the following dimension on your tensioner. It appears the maximum
automatic adjustment range is approximately 17 mm from the tip of the plunger
to the top of the tensioner housing. At this point, the plunger will not
extend any more to take up chain slack (A C-clip keeps the plunger from
further extension). So if your 100,000+ mile engine displays chain noise but
the tensioner appears okay, check this dimension to verify it's your timing
chains (or other contributing machine work) that's causing this situation.

Tomorrow I'll finish reinstalling the other pieces and start it up. If this
works I'm home free. If not, I'll be ordering a new tensioner. For your
information: Time to remove tensioner: 1 hr. Time to fiddle w/tensioner: 1 hr.
Time to reinstall and test tensioner: 10 min. Time to reassemble: 1 hr.
(est.). Hope this helps.
