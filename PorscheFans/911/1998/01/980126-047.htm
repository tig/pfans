	I recently bought a '98 911 C4S and I know this is tremendously
premature considering the grand total of 600 some miles I have on the car
now, but I'm curious about doing the oil changes myself.  I don't really
know where the drain plug is or where the filters are.  I also don't know
what size wrench I need.  I'm curious about how I'm going to get the car
high enough for me to get under it.  I was considering buy a jack of my
own but I don't know where to buy a jack or what kind of jack I need.  Is
there a real risk of body damage when the car gets lifted?  I noticed a
store that sold, I think they were called, "jack plates" that claim to
standardize the 911s strange jack points to avoid body damage.  I haven't
found a lot of places selling this which leads me to believe that there is
no real risk of damage but I'd love to hear other opinions.  Any
information would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!
