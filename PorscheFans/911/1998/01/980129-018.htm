I am running H&Rs on my 993, and have had no problems with suspension fully
extended.

It's pretty simple. There's a rubber plug to the microswitches, and when
the movable tail assembly is removed, it leaves a female 4-connector plug
in place. You will see a 'stepped' configuration, with two pairs of female
pin connectors. I fabricated pins to fit and short loops of wire to short
the two raised connectors together and another pin/loop to short the two
recessed connectors. Bingo. That's it. The computer checks once at startup
to confirm the spoiler is down, and again at about 52, to confirm it's up.
These connections tell the computer what it wants to hear, and that's all
there is to it. I wish everything about the 993 was as simple and
straightforward...
