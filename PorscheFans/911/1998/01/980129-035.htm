Well I thought I would add in the details for New Zealand.
All prices are in $USD ($1NZ = 0.58 USD)

List Price for a 996 = $121,220

We pay 12.5% GST (sales Tax),  and 22.5% import duty.  
Shipping cost would be around $3500 including insurance.  
Putting the car on the road costs about $200 including the first years
license fee and safety certificate (WOF).
If the car requires a safety compliance inspection add another $150 plus
cost of any work.

So an imported German $50,000 USD car would cost as follows;

car		50,000
shipping	  3,500
total for duty	53,500
duty at 22.5%	12,037
total for GST	65,537
GST at 12.5%	 8,192

Total cost	73,729  That's nearly a 50% increase which is not too
bad compared to what others are reporting.

I thought I would add in some other operating costs that might be
interesting;

Annual registration is about $100 which includes 3rd person injury
insurance.  That is, you can't sue for personal injury in this country.
The state covers most medical costs although this is changing.

Add about $15 every 6 months for a safety inspection.  

Now get this.  I pay $180 per year for full insurance on a $20,000 car.
It used to cost me over $2000 for the same car when I had it in the SFO
Bay Area where it was insured for $14,000.

When selling and transferring ownership there is no tax to pay for
private individuals.

Gas costs about $2.08 gallon compared to $1.45 to $1.65 in the Bay Area.

So you win some and lose some.
