I believe I have the exact same car.  It's color is actually, Nugent Brown 
(or something like that).  I picked mine up new on February 14, 1987 (my 
wife wanted to know what she was getting for Valentine's Day).  I drove it 
daily for the first four years but now unfortunately I only get to drive it 
on weekends as I commute from Kansas to Washington DC weekly.  It has 98K 
miles.  Other than the 15,000 service (which I have religiously done), I 
have spent less than $1,000 on repairs (other than tires).  Being in Kansas,
 it does get cold.  While my garage is heated, the car always has started 
even when left out and it is below zero.  It is a little tricky in the 
snow......good tires do make a difference.  I worry most about the other 
drivers.  Stay away from any form of ice.  

While I imagine I will eventually get a new one, I plan on keeping the 
Targa.  It is a great, fun car.

Considering you are buying it from a good dealer, I think you might be 
alright.  You can always ask for the previous owner's name and give him/her 
a call.  For the past few years, I have tracked what '87 Targas are selling 
for (the Washington Post usually has one or two every week or so).  Most 
seem to be in the $23,000 to $25,000 range.  Given yours is at the high end,
 You might try to get them down to $23,000 or so depending on the condition 
of the car.

If you get it, enjoy it.  Porches are to be driven...........
