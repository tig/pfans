Aldo,

I'm sorry I cannot help you with your annoying problem on your car, but
could not resist giving an impartial opinion on the beautiful island of
Sardinia.  I had a chance to spend a little time there last spring during
the European dealer launch of the new Audi A6.  Oh how I wished that I had
my Carrera under my bottom for those memorable drives.  Not to say that a
new A6 2.8 quattro 5-speed did not give me some pleasure, but it seemed the
roads were made for smaller (read 911 sized) modes of transport.  The
sights, smells and the exquisite food/drink will make return some day, but I
will have to make the drive from Finland to get my choice of transportation.
That will also give me yet another go at the Grossglockner
Hochalpenstrasse...

Jouko Haapanen
