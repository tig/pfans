Hello 911ers. I have a 1985 928S that I must sell. It is Weissgold metallic
5-spd with a brown interior and 86,119 miles. It has a dent in the front
passenger-side corner caused by a parking lot fender bender. The car idles
rough when cold, the A/C does not work, and some minor cosmetic work inside
is needed. Other than that it is in
good shape. I will sell the car as is for $6000 firm. 

I don't have any pictures to send, electronically or otherwise, but
if this interests you, please keep reading as I have included more 
details at the end of this e-mail.

MECHANICAL

The biggest flaw is the A/C. The compressor works fine, but there
is a hole in the aluminum pipe that allows the freon to escape.

The car also does not idle well when cold. It was tuned up 10,500
miles ago. At that time I had a vacuum leak that was fixed by
replacing the right cam cover ventilation hose. That fixed the
idle problem then. The idle problem has started back recently
so I'm not sure if the left cam cover hose needs replacing now.

The rear brakes were replaced about 19,000 miles ago. The front
brakes were replaced approx. 11,000 miles ago. The water pump, 
timing belt, and accessory drive belts were replaced 18,000 miles
ago.

BODY

The front right corner has a nice dent caused by a parking lot mis-
hap. Also, the front right corner of the plastic nose cap has some cracked
paint that was there before the collision. The front chin spoiler is
broken. It is still attached to the car but it definitely needs replacing.
Other than the normal tiny nicks from rocks, etc., the body is in good shape.

INTERIOR

There is a long vertical crack in the middle of the dash and a
tiny one starting to creep from the corner of the glove box. The
shifter boot is loose. The passenger window seems to be "off
track" or something. It will raise/lower but you have to guide
it up with your hand. The adhesive that holds the third brake
light to the window dried or something so I had to remove the
dangling light. It does work though. The fabric at the top of
the passenger door has pulled loose. When the instrument pod is
lowered it rubs against the dash and squeaks. The center piece of 
the steering wheel (whatever it is called) is loose. It normally is 
held on by 3 plastic studs. Two of those were broken when I
bought it so it is only held on by one.

Also, it has a Sony CD player with detachable face and the stock 
speakers.

TIRES

Three of the tires have plenty of tread. One is rather slick.
This is due to the fact that I did not replace all four at the
same time. An alignment/balancing would be good.
