I've been an amatuer welder for a while now - here's my advice:

1) MIG welders are the easiest to use but offer the least flexibility
and control over the welding process.  They are also fast.

2) TIG welders can just about do it all as far as positions and metals. 
For aluminum its hard to beat the TIG.  For really fine, low power
welding it's also hard to beat the TIG.  The main drawback is the cost
of the machine and the practice it takes to use it.  Most TIG welders
will also serve well as AC/DC stick (Arc) welders, which is real handy

3) Don't try an stick welder for sheet metal work - you'll only burn
holes and get frustrated.

4) Don't buy a cheapo machine.  Get a Lincoln, Miller or some other name
brand with a good industrial rep, even if you only use it occasionally.

Personally, I love the TIG machine.  I have a Miller "Econotig" which
runs off a 50A 220V circuit.  It's a perfect machine for auto/bike work.
