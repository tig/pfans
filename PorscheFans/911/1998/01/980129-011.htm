I have three sets of lowering springs. The Eibach Prokit, H and R 993 
and the Porsche Euro M030 springs.

I installed the Eibach's on my 95 993. Car is used mostly for 
Driver's ed and time trials and pleasure.  Ride is affected, it 
is softer on little bumps and much harder on big ones. Makes 
sense given the progressive rate.  If I did it again I'd use the 
1" drop version. At 1.5 inches, speedbumps need to be crossed on 
the diagonal and driveways are a serious hazard. Except to scrath 
the bottom of your car and ding the front air dam.  On the plus side, 
the car is nicer to drive on the track and it looks very nice sitting 
low to the ground.

I tried the H and R 993 springs on my 96 C4S which has the M030 sport 
chassis option. I ran into the same problem as Larry, they looked too 
short. Car was lowered about 1.25 inches and I had no problem with 
the springs moving around when I jack the car to change wheels for 
DEW. Ride was worse than the OEM M030 springs though. On the track 
they were a disaster. Our local track has a frost heave beloved of 
all 911 drivers and when I hit it the car bottomed out and rebounded 
into the air. Very scary since it is at the entry point of a 100 MPH 
corner!  A friend of mine has the H and R springs on his 993 with the 
regular suspension and they perform well. I suspect that the spring 
rates of the 993 H and R's are incompatible with the stiffer M030 
shocks. Perhaps the Turbo springs would have worked better.

I replaced the H and R springs with the M030 euro springs from 
Windward. When I installed them I freaked out, seeing the gap that 
concerns Larry. I called Windward and they said "don't worry about 
it". Well, they were right. They don't move, don't fall off and the 
performance is much better than the US height springs. Ride is 
unaffected and on track they are better. The car is lowered 1 inch 
and looks the Porsche intended it.   

Since I installed them, the car has done 5 driver's ed weekends, two 
time trials and a couple of autocrosses. I have swapped wheels (*R 
compounds for the track) each time and the springs are perfectly in 
place, no squeaks, rattles or other problems. 

In sum, I suggest you leave 'em on, enjoy the looks and the ride and 
forget about the gap. 

Bob
