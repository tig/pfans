Hello all,
I purchased a RSA this past summer and have been looking into
upgrades for it. This summer the plan is to put in new springs
( to lower it ), a strut tower brace, and a new muffler.

Has anyone noticed a big difference in handling with a strut tower
brace? Any suggestions on which brace to use - I have been eyeing
the one made by performance...

Also any suggestions on mufflers? The two big boys seem to 
be TriFlo and Borlla. What is the major difference between the
two? Also, if I plan to upgrade the headers at another time should I 
select one muffler over the other? Or should I do the muffler the
same time I do the headers. Is there a place that does 
comparissons between products, mufflers, brakes, and other 
aftermarket parts for the Porsche.

My final question is this: I purchased the car through a dealer
who I purchased a 3 year warranty from. But now I second guess the
warranty, the car  appears rock solid. Should I drop the warranty and
put the money into upgrades? Any suggestions would be welcomed.

Thank you!
.
