I certainly must concur with Mr. Cline's praise of B&B Fabrication,
makers of Tri Flo mufflers, etc...  After installing their touring
mufflers on my 1997 993 Coupe I ordered a cat-back exhaust system for
my wife's BMW.  In a colossal blunder on my part, I forgot to mention
that her car has an automatic transmission.  Since most normal in-city
driving finds her tach in the 2000-2500 RPM area, the rumble out the
back was decidedly unruly - driving by parking lots set off more car
alarms than an earthquake!  I promptly called Rob in customer service
(Dave is also most capable) who offered to fix the system and ship
it back gratis.  Understanding that the repair more than likely negated
any supposed horsepower gains, I was very pleased with their devotion
to customer support and satisfaction.  This past weekend I installed
a set of their bypass pipes on the newly acquired 1996 993 Twin Turbo
and was once again pleased with the quality of workmanship - and now
the turbo has a bit of a growl to match the acceleration!

Finally, all three exhaust systems were purchased through Jim at Winward
Performance.  I read some email not too long ago from a gentleman who
was not happy with his experiences there.  I must honestly say that
I've never been anything but 100% satisfied with their pricing, shipping,
and knowledge.  Felt it important that I share my views on this subject.

I'm a numbers guy for MCI (WorldCom?) Telecommunications and have no
ties whatsoever to either company, other than placing orders and having
fun with these toys!
