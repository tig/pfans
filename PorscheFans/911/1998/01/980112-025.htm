pfans,

Wow. 1.5 - 2.0 quarts / 600 miles for a normally functioning engine?

Sounds like a large margin to me.  I wish my own work performance
could be measured so forgivingly :)

I keep reading this to make sure I'm not getting it wrong.  Thank heavens
Pat scanned the actual tech tip and sent it to the list even though
it was hard to glean the gist of the data in digest mode while scrolling
through about 10 feet of:

(Sorry Pat, you're not the only one who has done this, but jeeze).

I suppose if your 911 engine is leaking properly (per Chris Welty's tech tips)
you would use that much.  OTOH, my 66 MGB always leaked properly and never
used anywhere near that much.

This metric is so wide that it is essentially useless as any kind of
indicator on it's own.  Why even bother?

Perhaps this is Porsche's way of saying:

"Oil is cheap.  Top-end jobs are not".
