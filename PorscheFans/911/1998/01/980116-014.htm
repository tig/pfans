Although I had not paid much attention to this thread before, this morning 
I was at the shop and after a quick check of all systems was asked if my 
brake warning light stayed on in the morning.
It does (very briefly) and apparently it is indicating a problem with the 
brake accumulator.  In fact, the owner of this shop mentioned that he could 
hear the electric accumulator pump running too often (his hearing is MUCH 
better than mine) and recommended that eventually I should have it fixed (I 
guess replaced).
Hope this helps.

It looks like I may have to pull the enginge on my 88 Cab. to do some head
work.  I have pulled a 356 but not a 911.  Will the Haynes instructions
basically work for pulling the engine and the head on an 88 or is there too
much difference.  By any chance has anyone posted a detailed procedure for
removal of this engine or one close to it anywhere on the net.  Possibly one
of the Porsche clubs.  Any help would be appreciated.
