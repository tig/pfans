I just received a Weltmeister short shift kit (with the 20% off from
Tweeks). The kit contains the shift lever, spacer plate, and 5 bolts, no
bushings included. The instructions seem pretty straightforward, but the
very last sentence is "For best performance, you may find adjustment of
the shift linkage is necessary".

Hi,
Has anyone had any experience mounting a CD changer in an 88 Cab ( or
similar).  I am trying to find the best place to mount it.  I brought it to a
local discount stero installer and his response was "Maybe we could put it
here, no that doesn't work how about here...etc.  Does anyone have any
suggestions?  Thanks.
