Hi PFans,

I finally got the engine apart and couple of things bother me.
Engine has over 120.000m and top has been open before.

A. Chain wheel wear is odd. Idler wheels wear on outside and
    cam wheels on inside. This looking from pulley end of engine.
    Chain wheel mis-alignement?
B. How to determine if chains worn, these has been changed as
    they are split type.
    Should I change them anyhow?
C. Chain ramps very brittle, like glass. I change them.
    Overheated?
D. On two cylinders the bottom copper gasket was pulling out.
    All head studs are OK.
    How can this be avoided?
E. Porsche have updated the head nuts, new style yellow, old
    was uncoated. Mine is old style.
    Should I replace all?
    Should I replace washers also?
F. Piston pin lock rings.
    Should these be replaced or can they be re-used?
G. Piston ring end gaps 1st 0,55, 2nd 050, 3rd 0,60.
    Side clearance OK.
    Engine leakdown around 5%, except leaking #6.
    Should rings anyhow be changed?
H. Cyl. #6 show some wear on exhaust seat due to loose
    valve guide. Measuring with old valve from bearing surface
    of valve spring shims to valve stem is 45,8. Tech spec book
    specify this as 46,0 +0,3 so this is out from spec. =

    I do not know if valves has been grinded before.
    What is the thickness of new valve head, so I could figure
    out if a new valve could correct this?   =

I. Valve guides has to be replaced, but valve stems do not
   show any major wear, I have to measure them, this is visual.
   Should valves be replaced anyhow?
   Should valve locks be replaced also?
   Should retainers be replaced also? =

   (In our race car we always replace locks & retainers together,
   but spring pressures & rpm is much higher.)
J. I had no plan to split the case.
   Should I open one CR to check the bearing?

All dimensions in mm.

I wan't to do a proper repair, but see no reason for changing parts
just for nothing and looking for advice. =

Onno, I made the engine holding bracket, You want some
details? No drawing with dimensions, just some tips.
