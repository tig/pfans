Hi Mark and Rosalind.  I'm not sure about the mark for the brake reservoir but
I wanted to mention that you can find armrests and cupholders.  Automotion
(http://www.automotion.com) sells a couple..  I think there are some other
companies that also sell them but I don't know of any off hand.

Oh and you're right there is no way to search the archives.
