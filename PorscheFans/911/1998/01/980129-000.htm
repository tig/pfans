Yeah, the 930 is capable of generating many smiles.  Last Friday night I
headed down 101 to Los Angeles to visit friends and the like.  The trip
down 101 was busy until South of Monterey.  With no cars on the road
near Atascadero I opened it up.   I have a completly new rebuilt motor
that has been running great for the last 3k miles since the rebuild.  So
with a complete inspection and the usual new set of rubber I grabbed 3rd
and made the pedal intimate with the floor boards.  This thing sure
likes to run.  Solid traction and feel through the sweepers.  Finding
fourth and winding up around 6-6.5 on the tack the car is sweet.  see
some tail lights a couple miles up so I test the brakes.  Everything
works fine.  So now I get pulled over at one point in the evening. Radar
said 82 mph.  I beg the guy to not write me the ticket and suggest he
just pistol whip me or pull a Rodney King instead.  I can't afford to
get another one.  The truly fine upstanding officer mentions the speeds
are not marked all that well and let's me go.  People can be so nice
sometimes.  So now the bummer is having the power and not the headroom.
Tracks are ok but there is no substitute for the enjoyment of cross
country FLYING on open roads.  Long live the Montanabahn.  88' 930
Targa.  Factory original, fresh motor, 62k miles.  In need of openroad.
