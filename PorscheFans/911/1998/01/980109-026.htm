Victor:

When you say "actual speed", do you mean "speed as indicated by the 
speedometer", or "speed as calculated over a measured mile with a 
stopwatch"?

It makes a difference, since there are three possibilities for error:

1.  If the tach and speedo match each other, but not the real world,
    the problem is simple:  You're probably running tires that are
    smaller in diameter than stock.  To fix this, you can either put
    taller tires on the car or have your speedometer recalibrated
    for the shorter tires. Recalibrating the speedo will make
    everything accurate again, but -- of course -- the relationship
    between speedo and tach will still be different from what's shown
    in the owner's manual.

2.  If the tach matches the measured road speed, but the speedometer
    matches neither, your tires are the right size and the speedo's
    just out of calibration.

3.  If the speedometer is accurate (i.e., at an indicated 60 MPH, it
    takes exactly 60 seconds to travel one measured mile) but the
    tach doesn't match it, you need to recalibrate the tach.
