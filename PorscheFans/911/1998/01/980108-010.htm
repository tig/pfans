911 Gurus:

I have recently purchased a 93 C2 Coupe 5sp and I love it. However, I
find the noise generated by the oil cooler fan under the right front
wing to be very tedious. It makes the car sound like it's electric or
something! Especially since the engine is so quiet in this year 911.

Question: can this fan be disconnected without any adverse over-heating
effects? Also, I wonder how many idiot lights would come on if I
disconnected it?

The engine runs very cool as is, I can't believe this little
computer-sized fan really makes the difference.

Any thoughts??


Best regards,

Hi P-Fans!:
I'm re-posting this for a net impaired acquaintance, since the server crashed
a few times since I first posted this.  I have no personal stake in this sale,
although I was asked to inspect the car for a prospective purchaser- that deal
fell through. Car is triple black 86 Targa, factory spoilers , 22500 miles.
Car seems in excellent shape with the exception of small dent on right front
fender and left rear wheel arch. Should be an easy fix being non- metallic.
Fuchs alloys. Battery box and floorboards look factory new. Car is located in
western New York state, near Buffalo. Not sure of seller's asking price. Think
24k/nego, more or less. If interested, post response directly to me. Thanks!
