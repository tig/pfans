What a wonderful way to start off the new year, but here is my problem:

Last night I was driving in a spirited fashion (not loaded with spirits,
mind you) when I shifted from 2nd to 3rd in my 93 911RS America.  She
refused to take the shift, and I ended up going back to 2nd gear for the
upcoming turn.

When I later drove it home from my friend's house, I couldn't get it to
take 3rd again, during normal throttle and driving conditions.  I tried
blipping the throttle as I shifted, but the gear ground each time.  I did
manage to force it into 3rd gear, but it felt like I was pushing a knife
through cold butter.  Then I couldn't get it out of 3rd without yanking
on the stick.  I can get it into 4th without too much trouble, but it
feels like the slots are slightly off.  

When I got home I tried sliding through the gears with the engine off and
the clutch fully depressed, but couldn't get it into third without
significant effort.

BTW, I have no problem with REVERSE, 1st, 2nd, or 5th.  And of course the
extended warranty ran out a few months ago :(  And I also report in to my
new duty station in a couple of days...  

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)
