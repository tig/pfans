While driving headlights started to switch from low beam to high beam by
themselves. Highly appreciated by cars coming across. And so on in an
erratic manner. For a while, it was still possible to correct by
switching the lever back & forth. Then twice, no lights at all. Pretty
scary at 180 km an hour on a deserted french country road. Current
situation is being stuck in low beam. All fuses are good. Switching
relays located in the fuse box of the trunk in order to detect if one
was blown did not give any result. Does anybody knows if there is high
beam-low beam relay nested somewhere else. Would appreciate an answer on
this before removing steering wheel which nut looks like requiring a six
feet long wrench extension to unscrew. Car is an original 82 930 Ruf BTR
in like-new condition (60K km) and apparently there has never been any
mickey-mouse electrician fooling around with the electrical system.
Thank you in advance.

Patrick:

There is a cure, but it involves the removal of the steering wheel and
turn signal/hi-low beam switch.   It seems that LUCAS gremlins have
invaded the Bosch electrics and caused excessive wear inside the switch
that controls the hi/low beam.  After removing the switch from the
housing around the steering wheel and looking inside, you can see the
two contacts that are too close together. Operate the hi/low switch to
see which ones make and break.  Very careful adjustment of the contacts
can cure the hi beam blues.   Be sure to disconnect the battery before
beginning.    There was another response some time ago that added
material to a spot on the switch.  You might check through the archives
from around six(?) months ago.   If all else fails, Tweeks, Automotion,
Stoddard etc. have the switch for about $100 US.
