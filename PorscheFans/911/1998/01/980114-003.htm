This happened to me and I am not sure if the same solution will work as
my car is older '68 911T. It had been raining on and off the whole day
and the car was outside. Drove home in the rain later when I went out to
eat it had stopped raining anyway afterwards it refused to start, no
amount of pushing, pleading, cursing would help. So I phoned the  AA the
guy came and checked the distributor cap, there was too much moisture
which caused it to short. He dried it out and sprayed a light oil into
it (Q20) gave it another wipe and put the thing back on, it worked. He
said the moisture from the rain and the heat of the engine plus sitting
and cooling caused water to condense on the inside of the cap and short
out the spark to the plugs.
Hopefully this helps.
