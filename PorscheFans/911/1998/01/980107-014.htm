If you can get OEM window channel from Stoddards, etc. then that probably would be the best way to go.  Mark, you might want to just give them another try. since they probably will send you what you need eventually, if you don't mind paying the shipping.  For a concourse restoration, I'm sure that you'd have to use the CORRECT stuff.

I posted the note about BD Company because I think that they are a great resource when you are in a bind, and need something for an older car that will work when OEM just isn't available.  I've walked in with a few inches  of the channel I needed and they have their samples all on a chain.  You can go outside and check them out on your car for fit, and then order it by the foot.  I didn't see the PANO article, but it sounds like someone else in your situation had some good luck working with them.

Also, a tip posted by another P-fan worked for my sticky window: just a small amount of silicone spray on the edge of the glass made a huge difference in the amount of effort needed to roll it up!
