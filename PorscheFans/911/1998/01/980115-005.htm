Hello again.  It looks like I will be moving to Camden County, NJ soon and
was wondering if anyone has any recommendations or warnings about any
P-Mechanics in that general area (which includes Philadelphia).  Any
insight is welcomed.

I have a '79 930 and am trying to isolate a high-idle problem that is
starting to get on my nerves.  When I first start the car it idles great,
no problem.  However, after I drive it around for a while and turn off the
engine, upon restart the idle jumps to 2,500-3,000 rpm and stays there
until I drive it around for about 2 minutes then it idles okay.  I have
been trying to diagnose this problem for several months and I replaced the
throttle-body as the old one had a small hole in it that I found.  That
helped a bit, but I can't seem to figure out why upon restart that the
engine idles so high.  If I let the car sit for several hours before I
restart, it idles great.  Only after the engine is warm and then restarted
does the idle go wacky.  Any ideas?

Thanks for any assistance with either of these two inquiries,

Troy
