Guys,

Australia has an import duty, or a tariff as the governement like to 
call it on cars imported into Australia. This is quite high for 
luxury vehicles though I can't quite remeber what it is. Supposedly 
it protects the earning capacity of our local car industry. 

We also have approx 20% sales tax though no VAT or GST. As well, 
luxury cars, those retailing over $55000 are also subject to a luxury 
car tax ontop of standard sales tax. Not to mention registration and 
stamp duty when you pick up your beautiful new car!
