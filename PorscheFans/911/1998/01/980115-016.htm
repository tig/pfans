Subject: 	Re: Driving Race Tires on the Street

Differing manufacturers of DOT-approved racing tires have differing views on
driving their products daily on the street.  Some things to consider:

Yokohama A-008RS, A-008RSII, and A-032R tires are designed to be street
durable.  That is you can drive them daily.  Other manufacturers' tires are
not.  In fact, many of them advise you do not drive them daily.  Some tires,
such as the BFG R1, may suffer cracking in the sidewall due to the stress of
daily driving (Source: Team T/A Newsletter).

However, be warned!!  These tires have shallow tread depths. (Most are molded
in 6/32"; street tires usually have at least 10/32")  This means reduced water
evacuation and reduced wet performance.  The best tire in this area is the
A032R with its unique "Aqua Tusk" Grooves.  

Also, these tires have unique compounds.  Driving them daily reduces their
track life by putting them through unnecessary "heat cycles."  That is the
warming and cooling of these tires when you drive then park them.  This heat
cycle consumes binders such as sulfur which reduce the elasticity of the
compound.  Eventually the compound will harden and will last longer, but will
not achieve the optimum grip as the tire with fewer heat cycles.

The most cost-efficient method is to have two separate sets of tires.  One for
street use and one for track use.
