Hi Scott,

With my '91 C4 the owners manual suggests a valve adjustment every 15,000 
miles and my experience, based on valve noise, is that it's about right. I 
do spend the money to get them adjusted at that interval. I personally 
dislike "package" service deals, such as "15k service", preferring to use 
my own checklist from the manual and other lists and request only what I 
think I need.

It comes down to how much responsibility you'll accept for awareness of the 
condition of all those parts that are out of sight under decks and hoods, 
also how much time you would spend under the car with a (well chocked!) 
jack or a lift. Since I use the car for drivers ed events I am always 
looking at brake pads, and flushing brake fluid. I change oil every 3k, 
valves every 15k, and I check belts for tension and wear, suspension 
components and rubber boots around suspension components for weatherseal 
and leaks. More money to the shop ultimately translates to buying more of 
their time, in exchange for your time.

So, as to $600 ... it's in the higher end of the ballpark for a complete 
15k service. The labor charged by my shop for a 15k (on a 964) has ranged 
from $300 to $420. Parts can easily add another $100 for valve cover 
gaskets, oil and filters. If you asked for a quote to "only do the valves" 
it would be interesting to see if it shrank the cost by half, but you 
should ask your shop specifically what steps/checks you'll be missing out 
on. If most of them include "check this, check that" then you can decide if 
those are ones you would do yourself.

Cheers,
-Ez Goldman
