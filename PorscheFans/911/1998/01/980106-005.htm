I did the same thing (broke a clip).  I ended up FIXING the
broken clip (I didn't know then that Porsche would only sell
me the entire assembly - now I'm really glad I fixed it).  

I first tried to glue it with epoxy and a steel stiffener on 
top, but the epoxy didn't bond with the clip's plastic (shoulda'
known, but I was blissfully optimistic that there was an easy
solution to my carelessness).  I ended up melting two small 
finishing nails into the top of the clip - it's worked fine 
since then.

I carefully clamped the two pieces of the clip in a vise, laid 
the nails on the top (back?) of the clip, and then gently pressed
them into the clip with a hot soldering iron.  The fumes from
the melting plastic were nasty, but the repaired clip worked 
fine.
