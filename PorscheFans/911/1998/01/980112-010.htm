Denny Lindsay asked about the dimmer switch in his Carrera.

I just did this a couple of weeks ago.  After you get the horn
cover off the wheel, you just need a big socket and an extender
(I think it was 27mm) to un-do the steering wheel nut.  The wheel
should pull off with a minimum of persuasion.

Once you get the wheel off, it's just a matter of taking the
steering column cover off (look for those small machine screws
on each side of the cover).  Once things are apart, it's just
a matter of running the switch cables (and connectors) through
the small (!) space next to the steering column.  It's a bit
of a pain, but things do fit.  The switch itself is just held
with two machine screws.

If you're running the stock bulbs (I think they're 55/60 watts),
you shouldn't need to add the relay.  The switch in my '84 was
original and the car's had H-4s for at least half its life
(It's at about 144K miles now, so it's had a few clicks of the
switch in the past 13 years, too).  Most folks I know that added
a relay were running 100+ Watt bulbs.
