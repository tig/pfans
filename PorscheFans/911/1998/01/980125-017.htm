This sounds like it might work,  but forget it.
Our local Police and Automobile Association did a test and discovered it
actually enhanced the pictures.
They even documented it in their magazine and the importer is in court
for misleading advertising.  Still I bet some suckers bought some.

"
We would like to introduce you to an exciting new automotive product: 
The PF-72000, Flash Photo Deflector Fluid. This amazing new fluid will 
prevent flash photographs of a vehicle license plate. The PF-72000 is 
simply sprayed on the license plate of any vehicle. When a treated plate

is hit by a camera flash, the light is enhanced and reflected back, 
leaving a whited out image in the developed picture (see figure 1 and
2).

Hi Chris -

You asked about valve covers and headlights on your 911SC.  I have an '87
Carrera, and I believe my headlights are H5.  The down side is that these are
very expensive to replace.  They seem plenty bright.

Re the valve cover gaskets, there are a couple of types you can get.  The
upper gaskets (intake side) are pretty much oil-free, so not a leak issue.
The lower set do need to make an oil seal.  I've had good luck with the green
ones that have a narrow bead of grey rubbery stuff going around the edge.
I've gotten these at Automotion and also at a local foreign auto shop.  After
8 months of service, the grey bead sticks pretty well, and is damaged when the
covers are removed.  But after only a few days of service I have been able to
remove a set with the bead intact, and reuse them successfully.  I install
them dry, and clean off the mating
surfaces before installation using a rag with a little carb cleaner.

One important issue with valve covers is to avoid over tightening the nuts.
The torque spec for mine is 8 Nm, which is INCREDIBLY LOOSE!!!  Get a torque
wrench for at least the first time, and you'll be suprised.  If you over
tighten, you can easily bend the valve covers, making them leak prone.

Hope this helps,

- Brad

Don -

You asked about tickets and seating at Laguna Seca.  I've been there for a few
Porsche Club races, and to a few CART events.  For the CART races, I've always
purchased the "Super" ticket, which includes general admission and a paddock
pass.  Never paid the extra money for grandstands.  But the paddock pass is
really great, since you can get right up to the cars.  Very impressive.

The great thing about Laguna Seca is that you can walk around and view
virtually the entire track from trackside.  You wouldn't want to spend the
entire day in the grandstands.  You've got to climb the hill and spend some
time watching cars run through the corkscrew, which can't be seen from the
grandstand.  Plus, there are two big hills that people spread out on where you
can see about half the track without moving.  Beware it can get hot, and there
is not much shade.

You can't help but have fun at Laguna Seca.

Cheers,

- Brad
