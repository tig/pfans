Hi all

I possibly have a problem with my 74' 911S. the car won't idle without 
the hand throttle pulled up. I know I'm supposed to use it at first, but 
my car takes about five minutes before it even tries to idle with the 
throttle down. Additionally, if I shut the car off and then restart it, 
it does the same thing, even if warm. Any ideas, I love my car. Except 
for this little problem the car is everything I thought it would be.

My '95 993 has the small-size stone guard in front of the rear fenders.  I
would like to replace them with the larger style that came on the later cars.

Has anyone replaced these clear plastic guards on their 944/964/993?  Is
there anything to be careful of?  What about installing the new ones?  An
article in the June '96 issue of "Panorama" covered it in cursory detail:

Removal:  "Remove guard; warm panel responds best.  Clean with Wurth 
Citrus Solvent Degreaser #890924, then polish surface."

Installation: "Apply with warm water and small rubber squeegee"

Any words of wisdom?  I have the 993 shop manual, but it doesn't cover
this topic.
