I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has set up a C2 for
Driver Ed and Auto-X. What springs/shocks do you use, did you change
the sway bar, what width wheels work good for the C2, I only use
Yokohama 032's if it makes a difference?

Abe:

I have a '90 C2 Cab.  I no longer compete (and certainly never did with
this car), but I now put on driver instructional events, and have set up my
car pretty much as I would if I were time trialling it.

When I got it, it handled like a pig, as do most stock 911's.  Lots of
understeer at low speed and lots of body roll in turns.  I immediately put
on H & R springs all around, which, although they have similar
compression rates, lowered the car about an inch and a half in front and
three quarters of an inch in back - big difference cosmetically, and
probably helpful on the track.  At the same time, I took off the stock
anti-sway bars and put on bigger Weltmeister adjustable bars front and
rear.  Big difference here, in terms of being able to dial in
understeer/oversteer, and in diminishing body roll.  Finally, I put on 17
inch 993 wheels with BFG R1's (R type racing tires, but legal and
extremely effective on the street as well).  As now equipped, the car
pretty much handles as well (although differently) as my former Mazda
RX-7 R1, which was one of the best handling street cars in the world in
stock form.  Lap times at Willow Springs are virtually identical, even
though the RX-7 had the acceleration edge.



I have heard a lot of talk of 993's losing control in the rear end, this
discussion was that it let go with no warning and that this is a 993 trait,
have heard of many accidents/spins blamed on this - anyone with 993
knowledge have an opinion.
_________________________________
I obviously don't own a 993, but I've driven students' cars on the track
when I've been instructing, and know a fair amount about them.  The
truth is that the 993 is by far the best 911 ever made in terms of
eliminating what would be colloquially called "tail-happiness," and what
more formally would be called "trailing throttle oversteer" (let off of the
gas, and the back end comes around).  As with most cars, it's best to
have your foot on the throttle to some degreee before entering a turn, but
it's less critical with a 993 than with any previous 911.  In short, the
people who are blaming the 993's handling characteristics for their spins
just didn't know how to drive their cars at the limit, which,
notwithstanding many opinions to the contrary, is the case with 99.99%
of the population, including Porsche owners.  And I don't say this
perjoratively - that's just the way it is.  That's why driver instructional
events like the ones I put on are so useful and popular - perhaps even
more so if you own a 911, which is harder to learn to drive at the limit
than, say,  an NSX or an RX-7.

Have fun, and drive safely!
