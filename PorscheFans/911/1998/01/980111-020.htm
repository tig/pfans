Don't worry too much about brake fluid.  British cars used to require
Castrol LMA (DOT 4) fluid because anything else would destroy the natural
rubber Girling brake seals.  Cars from other nations (with real, as opposed
to British seals) have seldom been so particular.

That said, there's nothing wrong with Castrol LMA, and there are now many
more choices in DOT 4 fluid.  I don't know if the other DOT 4 fluids are
safe for Girling, but they are generally superior to DOT 3.  Unless you ask
for incredible things from your brakes, any quality DOT 4 fluid should be
just fine.

Watch out for DOT 5 fluids.  Those are silicone based, and while they have
great heat resistance and don't damage paint, there are some questions
about their ability to lubricate a brake system--or mix with the remnants
of your previous fluid.  Don't use one that's not Porsche approved.
