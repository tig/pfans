Hi All,
    I am back agin with another question about my rebuild on my '72 E
engine rebuild. Just to bring you up to speed, I had all the machine
work completed, and have rebuilt some of the smaller items, and now am
just starting to put everything back together.
    I rebuilt the countershaft a few weeks ago, and noticed something I
thought strange at that time. When I removed the aluminum gear from the
intermediate shaft there were six washers under it. That is between the
formed plate of the shaft and the gear. This seemed odd as it would not
seem to serve any purpose except to act as a shim for alignment or the
gear, which was not too likely due the intricate shape of both parts, I
would expect them to be of correct dimensions already.
    Anyway, I replaced the washers when I put the new gear on. Today I
was testing all the components laying them in there individually,
looking for any possible problems, and found that the intermediate shaft
was rubbing up agianst one side of the case. I remembered the washers
and tried it with them removed, and what do you know, no more rubbing.

    My question: Are the washers supposed to be there, and I got the
wrong part, or is it possible that this was to fix an error some else
made, ie one of the previous owners? I have checked both the Haynes
manual, and the factory manual, and neither show a break out of the
parts. In fact they both say the same thing as the porsche shop down
here, which is that the shaft is replaced as an assembly.
    If anyone can help me out with this I would really like to hear from
you. If I don't hear back I will continue, and assume that I now have it
correct without the washers.
