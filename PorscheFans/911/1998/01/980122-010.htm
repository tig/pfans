With the latest discussions regarding R1's driven to and from the track,
will competition tires like R1's hold up on long trips to the track, say
5 to 20 hours away?

Most of the tracks that I attend are from 3, 5, 8 or 20 hours away.  I
would like the performance of the R1's but at the same time I do not
want to carry an extra set of tires with me to the track.  Any
suggestions?

Any comments from those who have run on their cars, at the track, both
R1's and maximum performance street tires like the PZero Asymmetric,
Potenza SO2, or other brands, would be helpful.  Thanks

A few comments:

DOT legal competition tires (stickies) will easily handle the 4 hour
highway trips to the track. Believe it or not, but compared to 100
track miles (a typical DE day), those highway trips won't put any
significant wear on the tire.

Now, if you encounter a lot of rain on the trip to / from the track,
and your track tires are at or close to the end of life, you'll be
going REAL slow. 

Driving 4+ hours on R1's might be enough to send you over the edge.
Those tires are NOT comfortable. I know I know, many people drive on
them all the time. However, a fact is a fact, compared to ANY street
tire, the ride on a R1 SUCKS. The track performance does make up for
it. Other sticky tires, like Yokohama for example, have a much better
ride than R1's. I can't comment on Hoosiers, but Toyo Proxes and
Goodyear GS CS also ride better than R1's.

There is a SIGNIFICANT difference in performance between competition
tires and 'ultra performance street tires'. It depends on the track
of course, but at Bridgehampton, a 2.85 mile track, the difference
is about 5 seconds. That was between Dunlop SP 8000 (best lap time
was a 2:02) and a BFG R1 (I can easily lap in 1:56-1:58 range). 

Personally, I have one set of wheels. I put the sticky tires on 
in the spring, drive to events (3 hours to Lime Rock, 3 hours to
Pocono, etc.), drive on the track, then drive home. In the winter
I put street tires back on.
