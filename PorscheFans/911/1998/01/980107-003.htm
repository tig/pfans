Walt:

Just a quick note to second the suggestion made by Andy Warren about
using PIAA bulbs. He is absolutely right on target.

We have used their ceramic-based H4 bulbs for over 5 yrs. Never a
problem.
As long as you use relays to ensure that the voltage is correct at the
bulb terminal, you will be amazed. PIAA's attention to overall quality
puts these in a class by themselves due to correct filament position,
filament support, quartz envelope material and heat tolerance. Just
super stuff.

My daily driver, an 85 GTI has has their 100/150 H-4's for 4 years: same
bulbs. These things really put out the light and since they are aimed
quite carefully, I never get "flashed" by oncoming traffic.

(guess you can tell that I really like their stuff  :^))   )

You can always reheat your dinner using high beams, too!
