It should be 20mm.  I think they went ot 22mm in '86.

Yep, this is understeer.

Increasing the front sway bar diameter will increase the roll stiffness at that
end of the car - this is not the way to decrease understeer, generally.

I think most, if not all, 911s understeer initially - especially under
power.  If
you really want to combat this problem by modifying your suspension, I
would suggest taking more of a "system" approach and look at changing
things that will increase the handling capabilities of the car in general.
This approach would probably include torsion bars and shocks in
addition to the sway bars.

Having said that, one relatively simple and inexpensive upgrade for
your car would be to add '86 and later front and rear sway bars.  These
mount to your car in the same manner as your existing bars, but are
22mm front and 21mm rear.  These can be had used pretty cheaply.
They are not adjustable, but should still work pretty well.

My '76 understeered horribly when I first began doing track events.  After
making quite a few suspension mods, I found that wider tires up front
made the biggest impact on understeer.  I started off with stock 185/70s
(can you believe it :>) ??) and then progressed through 195/65s, 225/50s
and now run 245/45 R1s in the front (and drive them on the street...).
No more understeer, needless say.

Good luck,
