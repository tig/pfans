Maybe I am being dense, but I thought the SC only had one blower for hot =
air - in the engine compartment.  I thought the slider for hot air =
(floor/windscreen) just controlled the direction, and the levers between =
the seats turns on the blower and opens the heater boxes.  If so it may =
be that the cable doesn't work on the hot air flow controller, or that =
the ductwork in front of the dash is a bit messed up.

I say this because I too have the "dead weight" blower motor (PLUS the =
optional "ventilated" heat exchangers) in my '81 SC, and I don't get =
much hot air from windscreen mode, but do get some from floor mode - =
this translates into fixing the stupid blower and poking around the =
plumbing in the front of the dash (and of course a good excuse for =
replacing the exhaust system - with a performance model).  A good idea =
since it is getting cold (consequently, I think this is the real reason =
some of us never drive P-cars in the winter :).

The oil smell is coming from the engine compartment - because the air =
enters the heating system through the engine cooling fan.  You can =
verify this by noticing how much hot air you get when the engine is at =
5000 revs vs. how little you get at 2500 revs (at least I can so you can =
guess how I stay warm).

'81 SC - means Super Cold right now...
