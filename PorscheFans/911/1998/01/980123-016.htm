I've got a 72T(2.4 MFI) engine for sale, it has about 15K on it since rebuilt.
The former owner rebuilt the engine\car. . The engine was rebuilt with S
pistons and cylds.  It has the higher compression of the S engine but I  dont
believe it has the S cams. The engine runs nice and is very snappy.  Its MFI
injected. I just had the pump worked on and its functioning fine.  Overall a
very nice engine.  Tensioners are in good shape, no horrible sounds.  I dont
believe they were ever upgraded but I believe they were replaced with original
tens. when rebuilt.  Please email if intrested and need more info.
