I am the new owner of a '96 993 and I suspect that the handling isn't
right...or maybe that's just the way these cars are.

The car has 11,000 miles and a set of almost new Dunlop SP8000 tires (at 36
psi.).  A couple of weeks ago, I took it out on some back roads that I know
well and got up to 120 mph.  I was disappointed with the straight line
tracking.  These roads have good surface, but are pitchy, rolling  a bit
from side to side.  I felt that the front end of the car was unpredictable,
darting from side to side every second or two.  I noticed this even at
lower speeds, say 80 -- 100 mph.  I've even noticed slight front end
darting on smooth, flat interstates at 70 -- 80 mph.

A sort of comparison, esp. on the back roads, is my turbo Volvo, which will
run at 110 mph. plus with completely predictable, comforting handling.

Are 993s like this?  Is this unavoidable with light front-end cars? Do I
have an alignment problem?  Some other problem?

If this isn't the result of something broken or out of adjustment, would
different tires help?  How about setting the front alignment at other than
the factory recommended settings?  How about different tire pressure?

Thanks a lot for any insights or suggestions!
