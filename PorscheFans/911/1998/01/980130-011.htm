Hi Al,
 I swapped out the rear speakers on my '89 Carrera 2 weekends ago, so here goes:
1. I got some JBL 4x6's from Automobile Atlanta  770-427-2844, part # GTO 462.  
They are direct fit speakers, so you don't have to cut into the rear deck, which 
would decrease the value if a purist was going to buy your car sometime down the 
road.  For only ~USD$51.50 a pair, they have great sound.
2. Pry off the factory speaker grille covers with a thick bladed flathead 
screwdriver.  Put some cloth between blade and rear deck vinyl to keep from 
poking through the vinyl.
3. The current speakers come out by removing the 8 phillips head screws that are 
visible once the grilles are removed.  Since the 911 rear window is pretty close 
to the screws, you will need a very stubby screwdriver to get the screws out.  
Another alternative is to use the phillips bit from a magnetic hex head socket 
screwdriver attached to a pair of pliers or vice grips to loosen the screws 
without hitting the rear window.
4. Install the new speakers. Unfortunately the JBL's I recommended don't come 
with new grilles, and the factory grilles don't snap onto the JBL's frame. What 
I did was use my old speakers as a template for drilling through the factory 
grilles (i.e. the screw holes of the factory speakers are in the same location 
as the JBL's, so the factory frames can be used as templates for doing the 
drilling).  The screws I  took out in step 3 are long enough to go through the 
grille, through the speaker frame, and into the body of the car. I also put some 
1/4" aluminum spacers between the grilles and the speaker frame (screws go 
through the spacers, obviously) so that the grilles would not become dented when 
I tightened the screws, and so that the speaker frames would not wobble around 
in the new setup.

DISCLAIMER:
 I know that there probably are better speakers out there and to get better 
sound you probably need to put larger speakers in the rear deck.  Having the 8 
screw heads exposed (i.e. above the surface of the grilles) does not bother me, 
and looks fine if you are careful with the drilling. I used a drill press 
running at a very slow speed.  Someone on the list may even know of a 4x6" 
direct replacement that comes with new grilles.

				hope this helps,
