I have a 1984 911 Carrera 3.2
Occasionally (not all of the time) after starting the vehicle the engine 
'hunts' for approx 20 seconds and then settles down to a steady idle 
speed. i.e. The engine idle speed goes up and down between approx 
800-2000rpm for a small period of time. It sometimes results in the 
engine stalling whilst pulling away.
It isn't a great problem just a little thing that annoys me!
Has anybody any experience of a similar problem and can therefore tell 
me how to overcome it?

Dear Rob,

       Having owned several C-2's, I can assure you that if that fan is
running, and your temp guage is in the normal range, something perhaps is not
functioning correctly.   Either your guage is not accurate, or the thermostate
switch on the oil cooler is malfunctioning.    I am working off memory here,
but I believe that the thermo switch (unless it has been replaced by someone
with a lower temp unit)  is set to go off at around 240 degrees F.    Well
Rob, that's kinda hot.  Hope you are using a oil like Mobil 1 . . .  otherwise
you could be setting yourself up for trouble.
And, that little fan does do it's job.   If it wasn't necessary, believe me,
Porsche wouldn't have put it there.     My suggestion to you is to have a
knowledgable Porsche tech look at your problem before it becomes serious.

     Hope I have  been some help.
