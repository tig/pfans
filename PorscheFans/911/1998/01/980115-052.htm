Thanks for the response.  The speedo is right on.  I checked it at a
number of different speeds and the time/distances check out.  Also the
tire size on both my 951 and the 930 are extremely close to the stock
tire diameters.
        For the 930:    chart tire,  225/50 VR 16   dia = 24.86"
                        stock tire,  245/45 VR 16   dia = 24.68"
                        current tire,255/40 VR 17   dia = 25.03"

If any case the current tire is actually larger (less than 1%).

Here's the numbers on RPM and MPH:

                       ---- R P M ----
        4th gear;      actual    chart     % dif
           100 mph      4200      3600      14.3
            60 mph      2480      2150      13.3
            40 mph      1700      1450      14.7

        3rd gear;
            60 mph      3850      3050      20.8
            40 mph      2500      2000      20.0


I even called the original owners of both cars and asked if the ring and
pinon gears were changed.  The answer in both cases was no.  The 930 is
an 1987 with only 35,000 miles and 100% stock.

930 OWNERS; If you have a 4 speed - go out and give me an RPM reading
at     100 mph, 60 mph, and 40 mph.!!!!
