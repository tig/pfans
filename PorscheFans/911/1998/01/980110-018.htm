I hate to say this, but it has been my experience that compliance with
emission regulations is based not on the year of the car, but on the
year of the engine.  If you never had to submit to any form of state
testing, then it would probably not be a problem.  If however, you did,
you might or might not be caught by a check of the engine serial number.
The risk is seriously high fines and possible impounding depending on
your state.  Here in Maryland, and Virginia as well I believe, you not
only have to pass the sniffer, you also have to pass the visual
inspection and your engine number is supposed to be checked.
