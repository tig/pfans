This happened to me a couple months ago.  It scared the hell out of me
when I saw that pool of gasoline on top of my running engine, and I
too payed over $400 for that part.  My mechanic's (Ken at SportTech in
Campbell, CA) explanation about the oxygenated fuel was exactly the
same, and he actually advised me to save the old part for a few years
in case there ever was a class action suit (against the oxygenated-gas
people, I'm assuming, not Porsche).

To answer part of Wayne's question, the engine was NOT dropped.  Ken
took the injection assembly off the top of the engine to get the new
line in.  3 hours labor.
