Hey guys,
i just returned from my mechanics and i had a problem of the warning lights
and buzzer going on while driving.
After a lot of research we found out that one of the two
ignition coils was not working,meaning that only 6 of the 12 sparks were
actually working.
At first we didn't knew the two problems were related
but after changing the coil ,the warning lights problem
was gone.
He told me that the timing wasn't good and the computer
gave errors.
Anyway it might help some people having this problem!
And my advice to all that have twin spark ,twin distributor is to change the
belt wich is very weak joining the two!
I didn't know about it until it was broken and a big explosion
happened putting all the plastic parts apart...
