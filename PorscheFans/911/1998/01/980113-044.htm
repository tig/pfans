have
great heat resistance and don't damage paint, there are some questions
about their ability to lubricate a brake system--or mix with the
remnants
of your previous fluid.  Don't use one that's not Porsche approved.

One comment I can add, however, when this came up on the MG list I
didn't pay all that much attention so check before you do this.

The 'problem' with Dot 5 fluids is that your brake system has to be
flushed out first before you can use Dot 5, because the old an new do
not mingle. The old dot 3 or 4 should be flushed out by alcohol before
Dot 5 is used. So its usually best to do this if you are replacing seals
and fluids etc., or if you are a masochist and want to go 'high tech'
with brake fluid. I can't remember if its good for track or not.
