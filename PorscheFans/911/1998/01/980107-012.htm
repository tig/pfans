I posted the following problem a few days ago, and have been contacted

by three others with the same problem. Can anyone help us?



<snip>

I have an idle problem with my '77 911 Carrera 3.0 (to all intents and

purposes, the same as a '78-'83 SC). It starts fine, both hot and cold,

and idles OK when it's settled down. The trouble occurs when I let my

foot off the loud pedal and let the engine revs drop from about

3000/4000 RPM. When I do this, the RPM stumbles to about 100 or 200,

which the engine sometimes catches and the RPM blips to about 1500,

drops again to 300 or 400, rises again to 1200, and finally drops again

to a steady idle of about 900/1000. Sometimes the engine just dies. If I

let the revs drop slowly, the engine settles nicely into an idle. Is

there something in the K-Jetronic system which controls this

deceleration, and has probably gone south?

Peter:

The *typical* culprit for this symptom is the deceleration valve.  Having
never looked at the '77 3.0 Carrera, I'm not sure which configuration the
deceleration valve takes on your engine.  The configuration of this valve
changed on the CIS Porsches between the '77 and '78 model years on the
"standard" 911, or during the transition from the 2.7 to the 3.0 liter
engines.   On the earlier engines, the deceleration valve is mounted on the
throttle valve.  There will be three vacuum hoses attached to the
deceleration valve.  The other end of one large hose is attatched to the
throttle body above the throttle plate, one large hose below the throttle
plate, and a small hose to the intake manifold.  Beginning with the 3.0 liter
engines, this valve is different in mecanical appearance but in function is
the same as the earlier one.  The purpose of the deceleration valve is to
provide extra air into the intake manifold when the throttle is abruptly
closed.   This is required for exactly the same reason as the symptom you
describe.  Before abruptly closing the throttle, the engine is being provided
with a combustible mixture.  When the throttle closes suddenly,  the mixture
goes way too rich (air starved).  This in turn causes the engine to stumble,
and also provides a polluting mixture out the exhaust.  The purpose of the
deceleration valve is to provide extra combustion air to the manifold to
prevent the rich mixture.  The hunting by the engine for the right idle speed
is caused by the sudden too rich mixture.  The mass of the air sensor plate
not being able to respond instantaneously to air flow is partially the cause
for the hunting.  It eventually reaches equilibrium, and every thing settles
out.

If the deceleration valve is what is at fault here, (90% of the time this is
the case) you have either a faulty valve or the vacuum hose to the manifold
is either disconnected or plugged up.  Either condition will cause the valve
not to function.

The later model deceleration valve looks like the auxuliary air regulator
(two large vacuum hoses), but with a third hose, smaller, leading to manifold
vacuum.  Both the auxiliary air regulator and the deceleration valve will be
found on the right side of the engine, near the front (cockpit) end of the
engine.

Hope this helps,
