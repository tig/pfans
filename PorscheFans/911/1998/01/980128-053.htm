Porsche Fans... Here's some info on oils, etc. I ran across on the 
internet.

	   OIL CHANGES FOR LONGER ENGINE LIFE
	                and
	 THE TRUTH ABOUT MIRACLE OIL ADDITIVES
                 By: Corey Rudl


Beware of low-priced oil change bargains. You will notice that the price will drastically go up with the addition of useless additives and extra services not included in the package. Simple things like a $5.00 hidden oil disposal charge, or an extra $3.00 for the 23 point chassis lubrication, etc.

Also, most shops have a tendency to include the chassis lubrication that they advertised but forget to check all fluid levels. Make sure to remind the shop manager or mechanic.

As a few side notes on making your car last longer, most manufacturers recommend the engine oil be changed approximately every 5,000 - 7,000 miles (7,000 - 10,000 kilometres).

	CHANGING THE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES (5,000 KILOMETRES)
			      	OR
	       EVERY THREE MONTHS HAS A DIRECT EFFECT 
	               ON YOUR ENGINE'S LIFE!

Even the AAA agrees with this. Also, ask any taxi cab driver; they put hundreds of thousands of miles on their cars and they swear by this.

It is now more important than ever. Today's engines are much smaller, work much harder, and have less oil capacity.

Synthetic oil is also a very good idea for engine longevity. It is much more expensive and harder to find but doesn't break down like regular mineral oils; therefore it offers much better protection and you don't have to change it as often (usually double the length of regular oil changes). Users have reported as much as 50,000 miles between oil changes (not recommended) and there was little evidence of wear on engines that have logged 250,000 miles.

Synthetic oil has been used in the aircraft industry for over 20 years -- they were the only oils that could take the heat and high rpm of the jet engines without breaking down. I have raced professionally for four years and have seen how synthetic oils have gotten me through a race where mineral-based oils have broken down under severe loads and caused engine or clutch failures. This is not to say that mineral oils are not good for everyday use; they are great. It is just that synthetic oils are so much better. Your engine will be better protected against wear, especially if you are hard on it (performance driving, towing a trailer, etc.) For example, any new Corvette or Porsche comes right from the factory with Mobil 1 synthetic oil.

People are becoming more aware and synthetic oils are becoming popular. Today, most places stock them. I personally use Mobil 1 or Castrol Syntec, but any fully synthetic oil is acceptable as long as it is the class and weight for your engine (stated in your owner's manual).

Whether you choose to use synthetic oil or not is your choice, but whatever you do...

	             DON'T USE LOW QUALITY OIL!

Your car is probably the second biggest purchase you will make in your life. Some of the cheap oils still state "meets or exceeds all new car standards." Sure it meets all new car standards when you pour it in, but for how long? These oils do not have the additives the higher quality brands do and break down very quickly. That is why your oil gets so black only a short while after your oil change. You have a lot of money tied up in your car, don't put this "crap" in it.

Also, as another pointer, only use pre-oiled air filters for your car. This reduces the dirt that gets into your engine which destroys cylinder walls (and eventually your engine).

Make sure you determine the brand, weight, and quality of oil you are using. Not all oils are alike. Some can increase fuel economy, some are of better quality, and some are designed for hotter or colder weather conditions.

Do not let anyone overfill your engine oil. It is common practice for mechanics wanting to sell you another quart. Extensive damage to your engine can result. The crankshaft can strike the oil and whip it into a foam (air bubbles) and that deprives parts of adequate lubrication.

As a side not, used oil from a single oil change dumped on the ground can ruin one million  gallons of fresh water -- a years supply for 50 people. Americans that change their own oil throw away 180 million gallons of oil every year. This would provide 113 million gallons of renewable oil if it was recycled!

What about miracle oil additives advertised on T.V.?

Most of these product have solid lubricant called PTFE (short for polytetrafluoroethylene). Consumers know this better as Teflon, Dupont's brand name for it. PTFE particles evidently adhere to the metal inside the engine and provide a super-slippery coating to prevent wear. There is some controversy as to if the PTFE particles can adhere to metal with the extremely high temperatures most engines are running.

PTFE provides better "slipperiness"; but lower fiction and superior anti-wear properties of a motor oil can be different. Let me illustrate in an everyday sense. Just because one vitamin pill a day is good for you, it doesn't mean that five vitamin pills per day is five times better.

There are so many different engine and oil treatments advertised nowadays. Many of them do not live up to their claims. However, there are a couple of good ones out their like Slick 50 and Duralube. But most companies make their products look amazing through a bunch of circus tricks. Many do not even have evidence from an independent lab that proves their treatment makes the engine last longer (or whatever it is suppose to do). But the people that make and sell them sure do their best at implying that. (I might point out that Dupont does not endorse the use of Teflon in motor oils.)

Here are some of the tricks.

One of these company's implied proofs is that as a result these additives, your car produces better fuel mileage. That circus trick is as easy as changing your regular engine oil to a EC or EC II rating (EC stands for energy conserving) and you too will get up to 2.7% better fuel economy without any miracle additives.

Another implied proof is how the computer in the car has to adjust to the new "engine environment". This is absolutely true. But what they don't tell you is that adjustment may be due to the contamination of the car's oxygen sensor from the new additive. That's right, what was presented to your as a wonderful benefit actually may be doing harm to your emissions control system and...

	        MAY EVEN VOID YOUR EMISSIONS WARRANTY!

But you say, "Corey, what about those infomercials showing this miracle lubricant allowing an engine to run an amazing 30 minutes without any oil." It does not require a miracle to make an engine run 30 minutes without oil. Actually, if the engine is prepared properly before starting and is run in a `no-load' situation, it is easy. This is even easier if the engine has been fitted with oil-impregnated bearings. Again, no miracle here.

Just keep one thing in mind. Some of these treatments are $20-$40 and usually have to be added to every oil change. If you are changing your oil every three months, that is $100-$160 per year added to your car expense. Is this expense worth the benefits you are getting from the product?

There are so many products out there that it is difficult to class them all as ineffective without trying all of them. It is a jungle out there. There are so many gimmicks to make the test look misleading, it is very, very difficult to tell the good from the bad.

I recommend you stay with a proven product like Slick 50 or Duralube. Although they can make the product sound like an absolute miracle, it is not. However, they do live up to most of their claims and you will be very happy with the results if you use them. They have been tested and proven by independent labs and some of the big oil companies. 

One question that probably comes to your mind is "If there is an oil additive that gives you longer engine life, better fuel economy, reduces emissions, and your car will run smoother; why wouldn't every major oil company start producing a similar product and sell it worldwide? Also, why wouldn't the car manufacturers start adding this additive to the oil in every new car to increase its engine life? They could offer a longer warranty at very little cost to them.

The scary answer is: If the oil companies introduced a product that would allow you to increase your intervals between oil changes and make your car last longer,...

	OIL SALES WORLDWIDE WOULD PROBABLY DROP 15%
	-- A COMPLETE DEVASTATION TO THE INDUSTRY!

By introduction a better oil product, the oil companies would actually be cutting their own throats. As far as the car manufacturers, why would they want your car to last longer? They need your car to break down so they can supply parts and servicing... that's where they make their money!

Let me give you a perfect example. Gas tanks were known as an item that probably wouldn't have had to be replaced in the entire lifetime of the car. They were a real reliable part.

A few years back the manufacturers started producing the gas tanks on newer cars with the connecting seams facing inward instead of outward, like they use too (where the two halves of the tank join together). Since the seam was turned inward, there was now a crevasse for dirt, water and salt to collect and help rust-out the tank. These newly designed tanks then had to sometimes be replaced every few years on newer cars. This caused a rise in gas tank sales in the millions and millions of dollars. These tanks are still designed the same today and gas tank sales continue to rise. The manufacturers love the increase in sales -- a pretty good sham if you asked me.


                                          Sincerely,
