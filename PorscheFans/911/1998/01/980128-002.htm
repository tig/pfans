This is a general breakdown of what is involved in the calcualtion for a
Porsche car or any car which is imported to Australia. This does not
include freight costs, insurance, customs costs etc....getting the car
here.

If the car is valued at up to $AUD23,300 there is an import duty of 58%
Any car over the $AUD23,300 thresshold attracts a 92% duty for the part
of the value which is over $AUD23,300.......yes 92%
These duties are re-calculated every January and generally what they do
is move one of the range percentages up and move the other one down. So
basically what happens is that it ends up with an overall duty which is
the same as before the made the change. These duties were applicable at
the start of 1997. Apart from these the final cost of these cars will
have to incorporate a cost to have the cars meet Australian Design
Rules. Who knows what these costs equate to.

All of the above is calculated in Australian dollars. So when the car
comes from overseas the country which sells the car has its value
converted to $AUD and then the duties are applied. This is an example of
how it works.

Lets say the value of the car is $US50,000. The current exchange rate
for US $'s is .65cents. One Australian dollar is worth .65 UScents.
This can be equally applied to pounds at the moment the Australian $ is
buying .39 of a pound.

$US50,000 equals........................ $AUD  76,923.
Duty up to $AUD23,300 is................ $AUD  13,514
Duty on amount over $AUD23,300 is....... $AUD  49,333
                     Sub  Total          $AUD 139,770
Annual registration cost................ $AUD     431 BARGAIN !!
Stamp Duty(payable on sale of the car).  $AUD   5,590 4% of value of car 
                                         ============		
                          Grand Total... $AUD 145,791
                                         ============ 

Yes unbelievable !! This amount does not include freight, custom agent
costs, insurance for car in transit etc. etc.

After this when you go to the showroom and order your car they will have
added a further 20% for the luxury car tax. Not to mention what else
will have been added for the car to meet Australian design rules.

This is why we are considered as one of, if not the highest, taxed
countries in the world.

Tomorrow morning I am going into the Australian Porsche dealership here
in Melbourne so I will ask them what a manual 996 costs on the road.

Hope this helped......

Now you know why you see so many Aussies overseas buying cars and
importing them back.
