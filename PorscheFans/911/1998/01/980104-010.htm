The purpose for the hydraulic tensioner is to accomodate thermal expansion
of the engine.  The mechanical tensioners are correct at only one
temperature, and are either too tight or too loose at all other
temperatures.  Too tight is really bad - you will wear down the sprockets,
and possibly damage something very expensive.  Too loose, and you will hear
the chain until the engine is hot.  The only way I can think of to get it
right is to do the adjustment with the engine as hot as it will ever get. 
Then you will burn your fingers very badly.  I too found an engine with
mechanical tensioners in my car.  Get rid of them!.  Put in the 930
tensioners ,which will last a long as the engine.  And be sure to replace
the chain ramps.  Broken ramps are the root cause of every "failed
tensioner" disaster I have seen or hear about.  A failed tensioners will be
announced well in advance by chain noise.  A broken ramp is announce by one
loud noise, followed by silence.  BTY the older style rubber and
rubber-coated aluminum ramps are prone to break.  The newer style is ABS
plastic, which is very tough.  Good luck.
