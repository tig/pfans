I can give you a VERY crude estimate - having tried a few 0-100kmh (62mph)
runs in my '90 C2, with a POOR launch technique, I have seen times on
my stopwatch of just under 6 seconds.

I believe 0-60 mph could be met in 5.5 seconds with no problem.

Don't take this as the gospel, of course - as I said, it was a crude
measurement! Good enough for me, though...
