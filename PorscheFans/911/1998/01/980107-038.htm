Rick- I recently faced the same decision on my '85 911. It had 6&7 x 15
standard Fuchs alloys (polished). I replaced them with 7.5 & 9 x 17 Mille
Miglia 993 cup replica alloys, Dunlop 205/50-17 and 255/40-17 SP8000 tires.
I haven't driven the car in the rain yet to comment on their wet performance.

Will this hurt resale? Depends on the buyer....if they are looking for
everything original, then of course it will. If they are looking for a
"newer" look, then you're ok. Gee, what insight I have. Of course you need
to factor in your improved satisfaction with the car while you still have it!

I would guess that your alloys are worth $800-1000 for the 4. Mine are a
bit smaller and I'm trying to sell them locally for $795, which includes
some D40M2 tires with 30% tread. If you sell them now and a later buyer
wants original Fuchs, they are readily available on the used market.

Prices? I paid $2125 total for the wheels/tires/center caps/silver lug
nuts/mount & balance/shipping. Got them from Robert Wood at Wheel
Enhancement. Super nice guy...knows his stuff. Good prices. Answered all
the questions I had and was genuinely interested in making sure I got the
right stuff. *Maybe* I could have saved a few dollars at one of the
discount houses and maybe not. In any event I'll use Wheel Enhancement again.

On my  "87  I removed the knob as follows. You have to pry off the top of the
knob. This is the piece with the embossed shift pattern on it. Inside the knob
you will find an Allen head bolt that threads into the shifter and hold the
knob on.
Hope this helps

Subject: Shift Knob Removal

Hi there,

I am trying to replace the shift knob and boot on my '87 Targa and I can't
seem
to
get the original knob off! I have read that the shift knob is pressed on for
this car,
(it certainly doesn't seem to be threaded on), but mine just won't come off by
simply
pulling upwards on it. Is there something else I need to know? (before I break
something!?)

Thanks in advance.
