Subject: BFG T/A R1 Tires


>With all the recent discussion on race tires vs. street tires lately, and
>specifically the BFG T/A R1 tire, I thought a bit of a heads up might
>benefit fellow P'Fans. The most recent Team T/A newsletter announced that a
>new R1 will be out soon, called the "g-Force T/A R1." A photo of the tire
>was published and it looks substantially different from the current
>generation R1. Although the article didn't provide a lot of specifics, it
>did say that the g-Force R1 tread will be molded at facing depth,  3/32 of
>an inch, thereby eliminating the need for tread shaving. It also stated
that
>the tire will initially be available in sixteen different 14-, 15- and
>17-inch sizes. The article states that both the g-Force and current R1 will
>be produced for a time during the transition period to the new tire. If
>history is a guide, you'll probably be able to buy the current R1 a lot
>cheaper once g-Force production ramps up to full capacity and the current
R1
>is discontinued.
>
>I've been running R1s for years on my '65 Shelby--and recently on my '87
>Carrera--and have allways been a big R1 fan.  R1s  are entirely streetable
>and exhibits good wear characteristics, considering their race-oriented
>design. It looks as though the g-Force tire will be less streetable,
>particularly in the wet,  because of its shallower tread depth. In any
case,
>I can't wait try them out.
