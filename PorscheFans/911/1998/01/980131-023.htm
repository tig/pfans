I am thinking pretty seriously about getting a '96 or '97 twin turbo.  I
drove one for the first time yesterday and tried to recognize any downsides
to the car as a daily driver, compared to a 993.  The only one I found was
that its ride is harsher than the 993's.  I suppose this is due to the 18"
wheels, maybe the P-Zero tires (are they harsh?), and a firmer suspension.

Does anyone have an idea of the source of the harshness over the 993?  If
it's the 18" wheels, can 17" wheels from a 993 (or other easily obtained
wheel) be fitted (offset, caliper clearance, etc.)?  If it's the
suspension, would backing off a bit on the firmness to 993 levels, maybe by
fitting 993 shocks, springs, etc., seriously hurt the handling, esp. at
speeds under 150 mph.?

Any other downsides to the twin turbos, compared to the 993s, for daily
driving (traffic citations not included)?  Do their air conditioners work
as well as the 993's?

Thanx for your insights!
