Sadly Carl, the factory manuals have left me more baffled then the
haynes manual (I have both)  At least for the few items I have looked
into.  Then again, the Porsche manuals are the only ones I have ever
seen so the only comparison I have to make is to manuals I have received
as an engineer.  The factory manuals are not the best I have seen, but
they are by far not the worst either };) Unfortunately, for automotivly
impared people like me the manuals assume that you kinda know some thing
about cars in general and also the layout of a p-car.  Which makes sense
as the people they are intended for are supposed to be professional
mechanics, but sucks for me.  But hey, if it were easy everyone would be
doing it!

Your best bet is to get both manuals and then post on this list for all
the hidden details and hope someone who has done it responds.

Enjoy!

-Michael, the automotivly impaired mechanical engineer....yes you read
it right, MECHanical...*sigh*
