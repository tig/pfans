Removing old window tint is a relatively simple, although unpleasant
process.
First, on flat side glass, peel off as much of the polyester film as
possible. Sometimes this will come off as one sheet, but often will tear
into small shreds. If you are careful not to scratch the glass, a single
edge razor blade in the appropriate holder will make this go a little
faster. We use an inspection sticker removal tool to reach tight
corners. Be sure to use fresh blades because as the blades get dull,
increased pressure on the blade will cause scratching of the glass.
(also the blades tend to get nicks in them which will also cause
scratching) be sure to lubricate the glass with a sprayed on mixture of
soapy water and ammonia. After the polyester is removed, there will be a
coating of adhesive left behind. Any solvent strong enough to disolve
this stuff is much too strong to be using around delicate plastics and
leather not to mention the smell in a closed in area. The same soapy
water and ammonia solution used earlier will reduce the stickyness of
the adhesive and allow it to be removed relatively easily. Do not allow
adhesive that drops  to stand on anything that will be damaged. It will
regain its tack as it dries.  All this applies to flat glass. Curved
glass with defroster grids poses a different problem. razor blades can
not be used as they will damage the defroster. In addition on older
glass, the simple peeling off process can take the grid with it. (this
can be especially problematic when antennae
are built into glass-defrosters aren`t used constantly, radios are.)
The technique here is to use a black trash bag cut to the shape of the
glass. A strong mixture of ammonia with a litle dishsoap is sprayed onto
the film. Before this dries, the trash bag is smoothed over the inside
of the glass. This traps the ammonia and keeps it from evaporating.
Apply heat to the entire glass (sunlight/heat lamps/defroster) and let
stand. Occasionally pull down the trash bag, reapply the ammonia
solution, reinstall the bag and cook some more. This may take several
hours, but eventually the adhesive will lose it`s grip, and the film can
be puled off without damaging the grid. Instead of razor blades, use the
type of scrunge pad used for cleaning teflon pots and pans with more of
the solution to remove the remnants of the adhesive.
Again this is not a difficult job, but it is time consuming and messy.
This is why profession tint shops charge so much to do this work. We can
tint two cars in the time it takes to strip one!  Be sure to buy a top
quality film if you plan on re-tinting the car, because many film
manufacturers will offer a lifetime warranty to protect you from having
to do this again!                                   Joe Padula
