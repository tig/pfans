Your local Home Depot/Lowes/Builder's Square should have a variety
of de-humidifying products (though if you ask for silica gel they may
not know what you are talking about). The products should come with
usage instructions to let you know how much you need. Be careful. I
used some of this stuff when storing a freezer once. When I opened
it after three months and (without thinking) stuck my head in, the
dessicant vapors that had accumulated gave me quite a scare!

I thought that redline IS reasonable. My '88 routinely reaches 
redline in daily driving and autox. Am I crazy or is this how the car 
is supposed to be driven (or both :-)?

That round piece of pot metal you found is the anchor pin for the spiral
spring that assists the window mechanism. It's broken. The factory, in all
it's wisdom, made this out of soft pot metal. So eventually, all windows
should experience what you have. Without the spring helping the process,
there's more strain on the window motor to move the window up.

Various Porsche parts suppliers can sell you a replacement pin. They're
available in two lengths and the slot (to anchor the spring) comes in two
configurations (parallel and perpendicular) relative to the flats machined on
the pin. At about $25 a pop, it's cheaper than a new regulator assembly. You
can see a picture of it on page 65 of Automotion's catalog.

<<aloha,,,,the other day while lowering my power window , I heard a loud
snap..
I removed the door panel and found a small round cylinder about 3/8" in
diameter
looks like it's made of pewter like material...this part that apparently broke
off from somewhere is about 1/2" long with a (now bent) slot on the end...my
window goes up and down fine but now rattles in the full up or down
positions...just can't seem to locate where this thing broke off from????
anyone take apart their door/ power window stuff and know what this part is???

aloha,,,merlin   87'  930....>>
