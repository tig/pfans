  I don't know if the list received my message so ill try again. please
disregard if it's a repeat.


hello,

    I've got a strange question. After dismantling my first engine a 72
911 2.4 T I noticed strange makings on the pistons as well a some other
oddities which didn't make any sense.  After finding numerous other
things that were either backwards or put together wrong  I started to
suspect that who ever did any previous work didn't know what they were
doing and may have used parts from what ever they could get. The markings
on the pistons read as followed.
#1    1  114  E  092        #4   0
#2    1  114  E  092        #5   1   114  E   082 
#3    1  113  E  082        #6    1  113  E   082


  One more thing I noticed is that on pistons #'s  1,2 &  4,5 all have
small hole around the perimeter of the oil control ring  slot which
appears to start from the inside of the piston and extend out word  just
gazing the bottom surface off the slot.  Pistons #'s  3,4 don't have
these holes that extend across the bottom of the oil control ring slot.
Instead  these holes are located about half way up the middle of the slot
.. 


   My questions are what do the numbers on the pistons represent? Are
they some sort of weight measurements?   and why do other pistons have
oil hole's in different places on the oil control ring slot?    I hope I
made this clear enough for someone to decipherer.   Please e-mail me if
anyone has any comments.
                                                                         
    
				Thanks for any help
