Walt:

I have... There isn't much difference among all the low-priced bulbs, 
but when you start paying REAL money for them, they get real good.

I have a pair of high-wattage H4 bulbs (90W low-beam, 135W high-beam)
from PIAA that are about five years old.  They cost me $75, but you
can tell just by looking at them that they're better than most... The
bases are ceramic, the filaments are held by a solid one-piece
support, the glass tube is mounted real securely, and even the glass
itself looks stronger than what you see on most H4s.

I've used PIAA bulbs for years, on a bunch of cars and trucks, and
I've had exactly one failure... On an off-road truck that was going
over big bumps at the instant the lights were switched on.

If there's no PIAA distributor in your area, you can call them direct 
at 800 321-1191... The part number for the 90/135 H4s is 14213.
