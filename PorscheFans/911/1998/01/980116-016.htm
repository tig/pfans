     Mike - good idea, but I see several potential problems: 
     
     1. Cellular phones - as much as we like to believe - do not offer 
     ubiquitous coverage. Most underground parking garages are not covered, 
     unless the cellular operator has a definite reason to provide a 
     dedicated system to provide coverage there; and coverage within 
     buildings can be sketchy as well. 
     
     2. GPS units - my company makes a test unit that is installed in 
     vehicles to measure the quality of cellular systems. In this device, 
     location information is collected along with signal level 
     measurements, etc. This location information is provided by one of 
     several sources. The early models used Loran - which proved to be not 
     accurate enough, especially in the midwest! The second generation used 
     GPS - which often loses synch/location in urban areas, and anywhere 
     where a 120 degree horizon visibility is not maintained (buildings, 
     tunnels, etc.) The third generation uses a Bosch TravelPilot with a 
     digitized map database. This has proven to be the only solution with 
     the accuracy we (and you) would be looking for. You can use the GPS to 
     snap-correct a dead-reckoning system, or a Travel Pilott, but as an 
     independent vehicular location system, we found it unsatisfactory in 
     urban areas.
