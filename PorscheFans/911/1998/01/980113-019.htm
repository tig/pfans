     Dear Folks,
         
     I have watched with interest the thread of the headlights.  I always 
     try to note which one is felt to be better than the other etc.  I 
     have come to realize that it is the most advertized light at the time
     or the most expensive one which is always preferred.
     
     Over the years I have used ones of every wattage mentioned in the 
     thread.  I have even included using them in the tail lights.  I believe
     in them.  When I was stationed in Germany I got hooked on using them.
     
     I went down to the basement to take a little inventory of halogen 
     headlights that I have used.  The following brands were found:
          Bosch, Carello, Hella, Cibie Z beams and normal, 
          Autoroche (French) and Raydot.

         The following brands of bulbs were found:
          Hella, Phoebus, PIAA, Phillips, Fischer-Autolicht, Mazda and
          Thorn (UK) (All of them burned out)
         
     Some of these headlight replacements utilize (2) H-1 bulbs and some 
     use H-4's. The  Carello's use two H-1's.  I do own a set of the Bosch
     Headlight replacement assemblies made only for the 911 that utilize
     the H-1's.  These utilize a moveable reflector assembly.  This comment 
     however refers to the headlight replacements sold  by auto supply
     aftermarker folks ie. Pepboys etc.  For this discussion, none
     of these replacements are of the sealed lens-reflector types either.
     
     I think that the Z-Beams had the most pronounced difference between 
     the high and low beam pattern.  Please remember however that it was
     not that significant a reason to pay extra for them.  They  were highly 
     advertized as being the ultimate replacement.
     
     There was a question about using the halogen headlight replacements 
     sold by J C  Whitney.  The Raydots and Autoroche were sent when I
     ordered the ones they advertized.  They came with a little paper 
     sticker on them saying to utilize them for off road racing only.
     I would say that they are of the same quality as the Carellos or 
     Cibie's.  Overall manufacturing quality difference of all the
     headlight replacements could be covered with a dollar.  
     
     I have used these head light assemblies in cars and trucks of all sorts.
     I liked each and every use that I came up with.
         
     Of the bulbs, all I can really say is that I liked using the H-1's
     because they were cheaper to replace.  When one filament of an H-4 
     burns out you have to replace the whole bulb.
         
     I haven't noticed the performance difference in bulbs that Andy 
     Warren did.  This is  because I probably  am less discriminating.
     Physically there are two types of H-1's in the pile.  Ones with a
     reinforcing wire extending to the end of the bulb and ones  without.
     The longer ones may be more subject to vibration damage.
         
     There are some recommendations I can make.
         
     Store unused headlamp assemblies without the bulbs installed.
     This keeps condensation from  collecting in the lamps leading to 
     damage to the reflector.  Store in a dry place.  Using some of 
      moisture adsorption material in the storage box would help.  I didn't
     follow my own advice..  The lamps that were stored without the bulbs 
     were in perfect  shape.  I went out to look at the car stored in the
     garage and sure enough there was  damage to the reflectors of the
     headlights.
         
     All of the 911's that I have owned have all utilized a relay in the
     headlight circuit. With a little ingenuity a separate relay could be 
     hooked up so that all filaments can be lit up at once.  I  have used
     100 watts in both high and low beams simultaneously.  I did this for
     an autocross event that we held at night.  It was very effective. 
     
     When   properly aimed, none of the replacemant headlamps  have given me
     problems from oncoming drivers at night.

The other day I wrote in to see if anyone knew where I might be able to get
Venetian Blue for my 88 Cab.  Porsche has discontinued it.  I could always
have it made, but I only want a small amount for touch-up.  Per Porsche, the
color code is P36.  Color-Rite has the touch-up paint, but said their code was
L36P.  Does anyone know if this is the same paint.  Thanks.
