If you get Autoweek, you see these raffles all the time.  The latest
edition had at least 3 of them, 2 Boxsters and a Vette.  They sell a
thousand or two tickets (chances) at $50 to $100 apiece.  The ads always
mention some charity or worthy cause as the beneficiary.  Given the number
of them, I would guess that some are legit.  They usually accept credit
cards and have a real address (vs. POBox).  BUT, it also seems like a great
front for a scam.  So, as always, buyer beware.

Here is the name and phone numbers of the gentleman in Germany who has a
rental company for tourists, etc. My friends was supposed to have a 993 Twin
Turbo for three weeks in Europe. They had planned a trip to the Nurburgring
and several other fun things. Unfortunately the Turbo was in the shop with a
sneaky electrical problem. This gentleman gave my friends two cars, a 993 C4
Cab and a BMW M3 to use for the trip and then provided a Twin Turbo back in
the states for my friend to tryout. 

I was fortunate enough to be invited to spend the weekend test in the Phoenix
area. Anyone ever get the chance there's about a four mile hill climb called
Harrison Grade on the way to Prescott. Not for the weak of heart. 

Anyway, enough stories. The guys name is:
