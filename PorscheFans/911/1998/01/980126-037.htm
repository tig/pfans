Hi folks,

I wanted to post this out so that I could get some feedback with regards
to what you would consider a good way to find a home for my 92 C2.

Well, I have just gottten a overseas posting and will be gone for the
length of my contract, (it runs in years)  So I want to find a means to
sell my car to the right owner... I don't want to sell to the dealers
cause I know they'll most probably try to sell it off to someone who
really wants the car... at a way higher price.  I think you all can
identify with this.

So, I am open to any suggestions you all may have...

Thanks..

Best wishes to all.
