Today, my driver side headlight went off.
I know its not a bulb problem because the hi beams work and the bulb is new.
So, I figure it was a fuse problem. I replaced it and still no luck. I
switched the fuse for my passenger-side just to see if it was the fuse.
No luck.

So, I am wondering if its a relay or wiring problem. I have a 1977 911s
Targa.  Its been raining heavy in the SF Bay Area and the trunk is
practically moist (possible leak).  I tried cleaning off the connections
and still no luck.

I have managed to foul all the spark plugs on my 72 S (weber 40 IDAs) with a
dryish black coating.  They do not look oil fouled. The engine idles fine but
has absolutely no power and seems to just barely chug along.  Before this
episode the car had been running wonderful, i.e. yesterday.  Could this be a
timing problem?  When I did check the timing, it looked to be set at 5 deg
BTDC instead of 5 deg ATDC, however, to adjust it back to the proper setting I
run up against the end of the adjustment slot.  How do I go about solving this
predicament?  (As you can tell I am just starting to do some of my own maint.
and am losing confidence rapidly.)  Thanks for the help
Chris
