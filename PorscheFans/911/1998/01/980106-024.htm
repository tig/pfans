I finally got the engine apart and couple of things bother me.
Engine has over 120.000m and top has been open before.

A. Chain wheel wear is odd. Idler wheels wear on outside and
    cam wheels on inside. This looking from pulley end of engine.
    Chain wheel mis-alignement?

Aligning these always drives me nuts.  Measuring for alignment unless
you have made some sort of special jig (which I haven't) is such a pain
with hard to repeat results (worse on the old aluminum cases, though,
than yours) and shims which are never quite the size you want to get it
spot on.  Looks like your chain wheels may both be a bit too far forward
(toward cam) as you suspect.  Maybe you can look down into the case
(with a dentist's mirror) to see if intermediate shaft wheels are worn on
outside.  One more thing to think of replacing if you split the case.  I think
that it is the thickness of the gasket between cam carrier and the 3 bolt
round aluminum cam holder which can change this alignment on a
rebuild.  The wear on these gear teeth always looks bad, but I wonder
how necessary it is to replace these just because of some wear on the
flanks.

B. How to determine if chains worn, these has been changed as
    they are split type.
    Should I change them anyhow?

I don't know.  I'll be interested to see what others tell you.  While wear
shows up pretty visibly on the chain wheels and so on, I can't say as
naked eye inspection of my chains has ever shown anything which
looks worn to me.  I suppose the chains are much harder than the gears.
 You hear of chains stretching (which changes valve timing, which can
be simply adjusted), but not breaking, which makes me wonder why one
would want to replace them routinely.   Chains, however, are at the low
end of the expense scale, which is the good news and maybe one
reason why it isn't so painful to replace them "just in case.".  If you split
the case, replacing with non-split chains becomes more desireable.  I'm
wrestling with this replace the chain or not issue myself at the moment.

C. Chain ramps very brittle, like glass. I change them.
    Overheated?

Like you, I'd suspect this - these plastic chain ramps are pretty tough, I've
never seen any worrisome wear on one, and they can be reused unless
broken (the tab which holds onto one of the bolts is the most likely place
to break when you take them off).  The heat which did this might be at
heart of other problems too.

D. On two cylinders the bottom copper gasket was pulling out.
    All head studs are OK.
    How can this be avoided?

New one on me, maybe someone else has ideas other than faulty
installation.  Obviously you want to replace the two bad ones.  Perhaps
the head nuts were not fully torqued, allowing a little bit of pounding?  I
think you should retorque head nuts say 1000 miles after a rebuild just to
be sure nothing has changed.

E. Porsche have updated the head nuts, new style yellow, old
    was uncoated. Mine is old style.
    Should I replace all?
    Should I replace washers also?

Why?  Use your old nuts and washers.

F. Piston pin lock rings.
    Should these be replaced or can they be re-used?

Absent some deformity, these can be reused.

G. Piston ring end gaps 1st 0,55, 2nd 050, 3rd 0,60.
    Side clearance OK.
    Engine leakdown around 5%, except leaking #6.
    Should rings anyhow be changed?

Why not?  I like Total Seal for their unique second ring, but there are
other good rings.  If engine was hot, ring tension may have relaxed.

H. Cyl. #6 show some wear on exhaust seat due to loose
    valve guide. Measuring with old valve from bearing surface
    of valve spring shims to valve stem is 45,8. Tech spec book
    specify this as 46,0 +0,3 so this is out from spec. =

This is a mystery - how could your valves get shorter, or your seats
taller?  In any event, you want to check spring height after you have
reground valves and seats.  That might bring it into spec.  Or you can
remove shims to bring into spec if needed.  Why not measure them all. 
Maybe all the springs were all set up tight.

    I do not know if valves has been grinded before.
    What is the thickness of new valve head, so I could figure
    out if a new valve could correct this?   =

I can't help you there, but if your machinist/valve grinder is experienced
with Porsches, he should know if your valves can be reground, or even
if they need to be.  This usually doesn't involve taking much off.  I
wouldn't suspect your valves are the cause of too little installed spring
height (too much spring seat pressure). 

I. Valve guides has to be replaced, but valve stems do not
   show any major wear, I have to measure them, this is visual.
   Should valves be replaced anyhow?
   Should valve locks be replaced also?
   Should retainers be replaced also? =

Valves go bad by bending, burning, or being reground too often.  They
might taper wear.  Otherwise, they are usually reused as long as stems
are within wear limits and the edge of the head doesn't get too thin from
regrinding.  Retainers and locks, like springs, are usually reused absent a
reason to fear something has happened to damage them mechanically.

  J. I had no plan to split the case.
   Should I open one CR to check the bearing?

I would think so - try 2 or 5, which are farthest from the oil supply to the
crank.  Rods usually go before mains, and you are concerned that
engine was abused.  If they look generally OK but hardly fresh, you
might contemplate replacing all of them, as you don't  have to split case to
do it.  Bruce Anderson suggests replacing rod bearings at this point in
his book.  3.2s have the "weak"  smaller diameter rod bolts, and you
suspect engine has seen abuse, which is certainly all the more reason to
look at at least one of them.  If it is fine and you decide not to replace the
bearings, all it costs you is two rod bolts and two rod nuts.

However, my 3.0, which I have apart at the moment, had been run by me
way too hot for too long on tracks, leading I think to 4 broken
compression rings I found.  However, rod and main bearings looked fine
(not quite so fine that I was going to reuse them once I got that far, but
good enough that had I been able to see through metal I would have left
them alone).  The bottom end on these engines seems pretty solid
(although you have the smaller rod bolt issue on your 3.2).
  
Consider the fact that splitting case isn't that big a deal once you have
the pistons off.  But that's the way of the world - just a little bit more time
and money and you can do more, and it never ends.
