Don't see what the big deal is.  Ran into the same problem when I was 
doing my '95.  Was just careful about compressing the spring/shock
after I put it in, and carefull checked the seating of the top & bottom
of the spring in the seats.  Car now has approx, 10K miles on setup,
has been jacked up & down to swap on/off track tires and pads, have
not had a problem.  Springs haven't moved in seats (I have checked).\
Euro springs brought car down nearly exactly to Euro height, have been
quite satisfied with results.

I don't remember a 2" gap on my installation; with nut tightened down on
the shock rod, the gap was closer to 1/2".  Might be difference between
my '95 ('94 production) and your '96.

I went to an M030 shock/sway bar as part of this installation; still have
OE shocks, if you are interested in them (German-made BOGE).

---------------------------------------------
FWIW 993 owners.  In the process of having installed Porsche factory euro 993
lowering springs on my 96 C2.  Fronts, no problem (1.1" lower).  Rears:
problem.  Seems that U.S. 993s have shocks made by Monroe in Belgium!  Rear
factory Euro springs leave approx 2" gap between lowest coil set and shock
spring perch.  When car set down, need to "manually guide"shock to correctly
sit on perches (upper and lower)!  A pain, at a minimum and IMHO not the way
Porsche engineers envision.  Solution?  Live with this (per Michael at
ByDesign) since no reported problems with > 300 sets sold.  Talked via
conference call with Howard at PCNA who confirms "problem" with a solution of
installing Euro shocks (unavailable us) or "tie wrapping upper and lower coil
to perches to prevent floppiness and assist guide downing when  dropping onto
suspension."  This is unacceptable "fix" IMHO.  Eibach "proline" series has
progressive rate springs and rear spring is 1/2" shorter than factory U.S.
spring, to avoid "gap" problem, yet still lowers 1".   Now have expended 7+
labor hours twice all with the original desire to maintain  "factory" and
"genuine Porsche" standards.  Hope this helps others to avoid "shooting
themselves in the foot."   Any comments/thoughts?  I've ordered the Eibachs.
