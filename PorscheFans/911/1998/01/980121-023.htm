Hi Pholks,

I would like to add a comment to Walt Fricke's excellent
short history of brakes.

While wrenching for tools, (apprenticing) at a friend's foreign
car repair shop I was given the task of changing the brake pads
on a large MB.  I was given a box of semi-metallic pads marked
"Daimler".  I opened it and to my surprise inside was a set of "S" pads.

I remarked that these were exactly the same pad.  He told me yes but
packaging with porsche applications listed cost more.  He therefore used
these on the Porsche applications and made a couple of more bucks.

Since ATE also makes brakes for MB and others, one could take a little 
time and probably find other interchangeable applications. 

I do know that this is also the case for CV joints.  Some drive line repair
shops stock the same CV joints as we use in our cars.  The last one I 
visited had CV joints laid out by size.  Sure enough there was 
one for a 914, a 911 and one for a 930.  I would check there first if I 
had to replace one.
