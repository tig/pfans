William,
 I had this problem. A purchased an "O2 sensor socket" which
promptly broke - just using a regular ratchet - no cheater pipe, etc.
I brought that back and got a deep 6 sided impact socket. 
That worked though I had to cut the wires and some of the the 
sensor off to fit the socket over the sensor.
