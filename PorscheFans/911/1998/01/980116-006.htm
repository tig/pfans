Pfans,

I have been browsing this thread and really have very little to say on
it as I have no kids... yet };)

The only thing I would hope the instructors at this event would stress
the most is now that the kids have had:

> the opportunity to learn to drive fast in a safe environment 
> 
that they do not take it as an 'OK' sign to drive faster on the streets.
As a lot of us know, one drivers ed event does not make a racer.  The
attitude of "Hey I went to high speed driving school so I can drive at
high speeds now." needs to be heavily discouraged.

My personal feelings on this issue stem from my beliefs that getting
behind the wheel in this country (US) is just way too easy.  Giving a 16
year old the chance to make quick life and death choices with a 2000 LB
car when apparently they are not considered smart enough to make a
single long thought out choice on who this country's leader should be
(i.e.: the vote) just doesn't make sense.  However, I do realize that
the intention of this event is to make sure that those quick choices are
the right ones.  Please do not get me wrong, I would like to see every
young driver get this kind of education and then a whole lot more, I
just don't think they should be driving in the first place };)

Good luck with the event!

-Michael
