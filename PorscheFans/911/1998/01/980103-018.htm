Let me start with a dumb question.  Where is the alternator located on a '89 C4? 
 I have a similar problem that Pete Semersheim has posted.  The battery goes 
dead after sitting for a couple of days.  I have not yet figured out if there is 
a drain, bad battery or what (the battery is new).  I would like to check the 
alternator voltage, but I don't know where it is.  I plan to let the car sit for 
a week after charging the battery.  If it is dead, then it is either the battery 
or or a current drain.  If not, it is the alternator. I will post my findings.

With regards to C4 hydraulic warning lights, I posted a similar question about a 
year ago and was told by a number of C4 owners that it is very common.  I 
recently discovered that if I blip the throttle to about 3K revs after 10 
seconds idle, the lights go out.  Not a cure, but I welcome comments.
