An outfit that I helped me in the past is Monterey Peninsula Reverations at
1-888-655-3424.  Several years ago I didn't have a camp site or room the
week before the Indycar weekend at Laguna Seca.  They got me into the Cypress
Inn where I now have an automatic reservation every year.

As far as the Historics, I'm locked into campsite #99 every year.  See you
there.

Forrest:

Dusting off my physics book (Resnick & Halliday p 96) "For any two given types
of surface that are dry and not lubricated, it is found experimentally that
the maximum force of static friction between them is approximately independent
of the area of contact over wide limits but is proportional to the normal
force which holds the two surfaces together."

Here is my cut at it.

We are not talking about static friction in the case of tires and, more
importantly, we are talking of lubrication (loosely speaking) between the
surfaces.  At high cornering forces the interface between tire and road
reaches (or approaches) a fluid state.  In the fluid state the tire provides
much more effective grip and the resistive force of a fluid is a function of
contact area.

Hope this provides some light.
