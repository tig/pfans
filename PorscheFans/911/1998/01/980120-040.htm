  Today I attempted to change the plugs on my new ('83 SC) 
911.  Thanks to the information gathered here, the job went 
smoothly until cylinder #6.  I bought the 3" locking 
extension, but the Craftsman universal joint 13/16" deep 
socket didn't have the hole drilled to enable the locking 
mechanism.  I used the rubber insert for pulling the old 
plugs, then gently slid the socket (sans rubber insert) with 
the new plug down into the chamber.  On #6, the plug veered 
right and landed sideways.  I thought that the hole for the 
socket was round, but I guess not!

Next I pulled the upper valve cover to see where it went, 
because I couldn't feel it.  That said, the plug was way over 
to the right on the "finned thing" (oil cooler?)  You can 
tell I use the "quality" Haynes manual, as I cannot name any 
part of the engine!  I tried to fish it out with a long 
screwdriver and really lost it.  I went and bought a 
telescoping mirror and grabber. (the long thing you push the 
button on the end and the claws come out the other end)  With 
my snake light and mirror and everything I could poke around, 
but still couldn't see or feel it.  

I called my wrench and asked him what to do.  He said to pull 
the bottom valve cover to see if I could see it there.  Nope. 

My question is:  Because I don't know where the plug is, is 
it going to enter the engine, etc. or is it in an 
innocuous place and will eventually rattle out?  I don't want 
to have to tow it in and pay big $$$ to pull it out if at all 
possible.  

Any one else have this trouble, or am I the only one with bad 
luck and a negative IQ?

Thank You in Advance

Chris Jares

PS:  I need to have this car running soon.  My other way to 
work is my feet!
