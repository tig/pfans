Could you forward any responses to me?  I will be changing my own plugs 
soon for the first time on my 81 SC.

Let me get this straight.  The "hole" that the plug goes in in the 
valve cover is not solid?  So the plug, in essence fell sideways in the 
well that the plug goes into?  Man that is scary, especially 
considering the cramped nature of #6.

I hope that I misunderstood your post, but could you clarify?

Thanks,
Alex



Alex:

The #6 (and I guess #3 too) plug chambers are not what they seem!  
Rather than being a normal deep round hole to slide the plug into, they 
open out onto the rear oil cooler.  This is where I miscalculated, 
and the plug went down and landed sideways.  After trying to fish it 
out with my fingers, I couldn't feel it any more.  I pulled the upper 
valve cover and saw it resting on the oil cooler.  This is where I 
should have gone and bought the grabber to snag it and retrieve. Oops! 
Unfortunately I didn't find the plug but my mechanic and Walter 
confirmed my feeling that there are no moving parts up there, so I will 
just have a plug lodged up in the upper mechanics above the engine 
until it rattles out or is removed.  

I bought another plug and installed it using the mechanic's advise of 
using a piece of rubber hose (about 8") to fit over the ceramic part of 
the plug (find it at an auto parts place... they sell it by the foot).  
With this rig you can easily lower the plug into the chamber and get it 
started in the threads without the worry of losing your plug.  When 
it's hand tight, just pull the rubber off and finish up with the 
ratchet.  I wish I'd known this before!!

The car runs fine and I am going to have the engine pulled out tomorrow 
anyway because I am taking it in for transmission work.

Thanks to all who helped...
