I recal reading somewhere that it is best to adjust the valves 
without removing the plugs since pulling the plugs can loosen bits of 
carbon that might stick to the valves/valve seats and prevent them 
from closing all the way. If this happens, your adjustment will be 
off once the engine is started and the carbon blows out. I have no 
first hand experience with this and I was just wondering if I'm being 
over cautious or if this is a legitimate concern.

I did the valves on my '88 Carrera this weekend and found that by 
putting the car in 5th and jacking one wheel off the ground, I could 
easily turn the engine by rotating the wheel - even with the plugs 
still in (don't try this if you have a limited slip diff :-).
