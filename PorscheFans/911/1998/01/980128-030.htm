	Hi Andrew,

	I spoke with my supplier of the Euro M030 springs and they
	say they have had no complaints with ~70 installs of these
	springs!

	AMEN!!! although I would'nt like to make a habit of hitting
	the bum stops to often!

	I guess I'm not familiar with "suspension droop travel"
	but surely (he stated in ignorant bliss of the reality) if
	one fitted the Euro-spec shocks with the Euro springs this
	would result in a factory spec combination that would be
	within the appropriate parameters for droop travel, unless
	of course the U.S suspension differed more from the Euro
	than we know?

	I used to be a frustrated BMW M3 owner seeking the Euro-spec
	engine and transmission for my U.S car, and now I am a 
	frustrated 993 owner seeking an appropriate Euro suspension
	there is nothing for it I'll have to move to Europe get
	get a car that isnt significantly altered for the U.S 
	market ... sounds like a constitutional amendment is needed
	here ... I can own a gun, but I cant drive a Porsche 1"
	lower!

	8^)

	Thanks Again

	- Larry.
