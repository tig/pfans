Colin,

Changing shocks and t-bars for a late-model Carrera is basically the same=
=20
procedure as all previous years.  The only procedure which might require=20
realignment is replacing the rear t-bars, which requires disassembly of=20
virtually the entire rear suspension.

If you carefully mark the locations of the spring plates (use a=20
contrasting crayon, etc. and draw along the upper edge of the plate=20
before removing) AND note the locations of the camber/toe eccentric=20
bolts, you may be able to avoid realignment.

Front end: no problem.  The t-bars are removed out the back end of the=20
A-Arms...again, note the location of the threaded adjuster bolt before=20
removing, as well as the location of the upper strut mount in the body=20
openings.

Plan to spend a full weekend (12+ hours) to do bars and shocks, "IF"=20
nothing else is broken or breaks in the process.
