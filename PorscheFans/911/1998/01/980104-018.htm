Hey all,

        I have been informed by my mechanic that I need new CV joint(s).  I
hear a noise that only seems to come from the right side of the car.  But he
says that it is possible all four are worn out. With CV joints @ 90$ each,
plus labor, this could end up being a seriously expensive bill.  From reading
the past posts, it seems that you can take a worn out CV joint from the right
side of the car, and swap it with one on the the left side of the car.  About
how much mileage do you get out of the swap versus just replacing? 
        If BOTH sides of the car need new CV's, then it would be econmically
smarter to do the swap, than buy new ones, cause you would have  had to pay
the labor to take apart various parts of the drive train's on BOTH sides.
But, if only ONE side of the car has CV joints that need to be replaced, would
it be more expensive in labor to do the swap?  Cause there would be all that
extra labor to take out the CV joint, on the other side, that did not need to
be replaced.  So basically what I am saying is, about how long does it take a
good mechanic to take out (one or both) CV's on a given side?  Is it only
beneficial to do the swap if BOTH sides need replacing?

PS: please don't respond saying I should do the work myself myself, cause I
won't!
