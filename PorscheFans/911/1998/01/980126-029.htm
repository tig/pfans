   I used Wheel Collision Center about 2 years ago to fix a 3-piece
   17" Gotti.  They charged me $125 to take out 3 small dents.  The
   work was very good since you could not really tell where the dents
   had been.  They're near me in Bath, PA and I dropped off and picked
   up the rim.  Turnaround was around 2 days.  They said they use
   a patented process developed with Lehigh Univ. to heat the area to
   a critical temp (heat treating?) first.  I also saw wheels which they
   had stripped and refinished and they looked new.
