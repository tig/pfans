I got a car seat for children 20-40 pounds directly from one
of the local Porsche dealerships.  It has the Porsche logo all
over it, which is the only reason I can think of that it would
cost $300.  It does work, and it does fit in the back seat of
my 90 C4 Cab.  My daughter (11 months old) loves it!  Check 
with your local new Porsche dealership if you are interested.  
If you can't get any response, I bought mine from Park Place
Porsche in downtown Dallas, TX.

Good luck !
