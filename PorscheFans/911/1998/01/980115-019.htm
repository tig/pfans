I'm ready to replace the shocks on my '88 Targa.  I recently
discovered that they are the original shocks at 100K miles, and can't
imagine them being good anymore.  What are your thoughts about also
replacing the torsion bars on a street-only car with this mileage?  Do
the torsion bars wear perceptibly by this point, or would it be a
waste of money?  Is there a definitive test that doesn't involve
taking them out for inspection? The car "seems" to handle fine, but
then this is my first 911.=20

--Can anyone point me to or send me a procedure for changing shocks
and/or torsion bars  on an '88 Targa?  The Haynes manual is useless
for the Carreras in this area. I'd like to understand the procedure
even if I don't do it myself.

--How difficult are the shocks and torsion bars to change?  It looks
like the cartriges can change without affecting alignment but the
torsion bars would require realigning (no big deal, but want to know
for sure)?? If I do change the torsion bars, I am planning to follow
Bruce Anderson's size recommendations from his book.

If you can answer ANY of these questions, I'd like to hear about it.
Thank you!
