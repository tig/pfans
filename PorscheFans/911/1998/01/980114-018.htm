Hi all,

Some of you may recall that I posted a concern regarding a ticking sound
coming from the 1-2-3 bank on my car.  I just wanted to thank all who
replied and thought the collective may be interested in what I have
found so far.

Double checking the valve clearances, on the 1-2-3 bank, I found all to
be okay, ie. .004".  While checking the valve clearances, I also checked
for valve guide wear by using a screw drive to see if I could move the
valve from side to side.  The only valve with any perceptible movement
was the #1 exhaust valve.  According to the Haynes Manual, the upper
limit on exhaust guide wear is .0075", almost two times the valve
clearance of .004".  The amount that I could move the valve did not feel
or look like two times the valve clearance and I could detect no sign of
carbon tracking up the valve stem, so I think that the guide may still
be okay.

I then proceeded to remove the timing chain covers and found a broken
chain rail with the broken piece wedged between the timing chain and the
case.  I think I am the world's luckiest 911 owner!  That explains the
little piece of plastic I found in the sump screen when I drained the
oil to begin this exploration.

Well, now I'm just waiting on chain tensioners and chain rails to
arrive.  Hopefully I have found the source of my ticking.
