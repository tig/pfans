I redid all the rubber on my '68 911 last year during its restoration. I ordered all the seals, doors, windows, hood, engine deck lid, and all the other stuff that goes between the
fenders, headlights, etc., from Tweeks. Everything worked just fine, and the prices were competetive. During the restoration I also ordered a lot of stuff from Performance Products, and
from Automotion, all of which worked well. All three companies were easy to deal with, and accepted returns, wrong orders, etc. gracefully.

The shop that did my restoration advised against buying one of the complete rubber kits that they all advertise, saying that I would end up with a lot of parts I wouldn't use. My total
cost for seals ran about $300-$350, and the kits cost around $600. I still have a front windshield seal I didn't need; if you can use it, I'd sell it for $15 plus UPS shipping, about
half price. It is still in its sealed plastic shipping, with the Tweeks and Porsche part #s.
