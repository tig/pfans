Todd S. seems to like these tires for the street.  If you're going to run
race tires on the street I guess they're as good a choice as
any....but...there are a number of good reasons why you may not want
to run
them on the street....

1.  They are'nt as puncture resistant as your average street tire
____________________________________
Agreed, but in the 10 years I've been running them, I've only lost 3 tires
on the street, which probably isn't much worse an average than with
street tires.  Moreover, I had insurance on them from America's Tire, and
2 of the three times, I got new tires for free (the tires shredded
themselves, suggesting some type of defect).


2.  You ain't gonna get 'em hot enough on the street to be able to use
anywhere near their capability. You asked why more rock chips with an
R1.....go to the track and stand in pit lane when cars come off with hot
tires and drive by slowly.....if you listen to the tire passing over
asphalt, it sounds like tearing two pieces of velcro apart....that's the
sticky part that picks up rocks and throws them off when spinning with
increased speed.  You won't get 'em hot enough on the street to do this
so
probably won't notice more rock chips....but you never get to use the tire
anywhere near capacity.
__________________________________
I can't agree with this completely.  Granted, you won't get them as hot as
after a lap or two around Willow Springs, with 95, 130 and 100 mile per
hour turns in Turns 2, 8 and 9 respectively, but it's not that hard to get
them warm enough to reap the vast majority of their benfits.  For sure, if
you take them on a twisty road like Mulholland or the Angeles Crest
Highway, within 4 hard turns or so, they're rarin' to go.  I even notice that
they get hot and start to stick quite well in the middle of a long on ramp.  I
note also that R1's heat up considerably faster than the Yokoham 008
RS's I used to run.



3.  They're slippery when cold.
___________________________
If you're speaking relatively, compared to when they're hot, then this is
true.  But objectively speaking, I wouldn't say it's any concern, as long as
one realizes that they need to warm a bit up before fully utilizing them.


4.  They turn with much more difficulty when going slow (parking, etc.)
___________________________
I've never noticed any problem.


5.  They don't wear very well, even though you're not using them to their
capacity.
____________________________
I've already noted this.  However, since R1's cost half as much as S02's,
and probably last longer than half as long, they may be more cost
effective.



6.  One sidewall is very stiff so the ride sucks.....
_____________________________
The ride may not be quite as "cushy" as with a street tire, but any
increased harshness (which is not too bad a all) is more than
compensated by the performance gain.


7.  If you do get caught it the rain, I hope you've driven on ice....
______________________________
I must disagree with this statement.  I drive mine year round, including in
the rain, and I drive them until they're slick.  I just instructed at an event at
Willow Springs that wound up being run in the rain.  I took several
students out in my car, and my R1's, which are pretty low on tread in the
front, did surprisingly well.  True, they're not as effective in the rain as a
full tread street tire, but as long as one realizes this, they're fine. 


I could probably come up with more reasons if I thought more about it. 
I've
driven on the street with them on the way to an event....I wouldn't have if
I didn't have to.......
________________________________
I guess the Pfans folks have heard differing views, and they'll decide. 
But I'd appreciate anyone posting his/her impressions if he/she gets the
R1's and runs them on the street.  Eveyone I've talked to who does it
says they can't believe they drove on street tires as long as they did.
