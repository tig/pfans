PFans,

You may remember I posted last week about my fuel gauge which was 
stuck at the half way point no matter how much feul was in the tank. 
Judging from the amount of mail I received this is a really common 
problem.

Today I removed the unit, disassembled it and gave it a clean, 
as well as cleaned the electrical connections and it now works 
perfectly. These were the steps I took.

Removing the sender unit.

1. Remove carpet from trunk. This is needed as the fuel can leak from 
the sender during removal. Place fire extinguisher within easy reach. 
Also, be sure to carry this procedure out in  well ventilated area.

2. Place  towels inside trunk around sending unit to soak up any 
leaked fuel.

3. unplug electrical system plug.

4. remove filler cap to let pressure out of the system. (I 
don't know ifd this us required byut i felt better about 
relieving the pressure at the filler cap rather than when 
undoing the bolts holding the sender in)

5. remove the five 8mm nuts securing the sending unit.

6. gently lift sending unit up from its position. I made sure to lift 
very slowly to alolw the fuel to drain from the unit back into the 
tank rather than into the trunk.

7. stuff a rag in the now empty spot where the unit was to stop the 
fuel vapours escaping and to insure against any dirt or pesky type 
rodents entering the fuel cell.

8. check sending unit gasket to see if it's in good enough 
condition to use again. Mine was.

Disassembly

The sender is a long cylinder, about 300mm in length and 40mm in 
diameter with electrical connectors at the top and pin holes to allow 
the fuel to enter the unit at the bottom. It's secured by a 4mm nut 
and locking washer at the bottom.

9. with needle nose pliers, bend the small locking washer flat so you 
can access the nut to remove it.

10. slide the float assembly from the housing.

Cleaning the Unit

It has one thin wire which runs the length of the unit and then back 
up the other side, as well as a copper earth wire. In fact, the long 
thin wire looks like two different wires but it crosses from one 
side of  the assembly to the other. This wire supports a cork like 
float with two electrical contacts that touch each side of the wire. 
The unit measures the resistance of the electrical circuit depending 
on the location of the float. There is also a contact at the bottom 
of the unit that the sender closes to activate the low fuel warning 
light.

11. check the integrity of the active wire. The float should move 
freely up and down the wire. Also check the solders at each end where 
the wire connects for both the active wire and the earth. My earth 
was very dirty with what looked like some type of corrosion. If the 
float or the wires are damaged, you could try to fix them or maybe 
the easier path would be to order a new sender unit
(p/n 901.741.801.00) as it's quite delicate in there. 

12. lightly sand the active wire and all the contacts with some emery 
cloth or fine glass paper, being careful not to rub too hard.

13. I then lightly sprayed the wires and contacts, as well as the 
outer electrical contacts where the lug connects with some WD-40 
(don't know if you have that in the US) then left it to dry.

Reassembly

14. as per disassembly. The float assembly is keyed to the housing by 
a notch at the top so you can't assemble it incorrectly, though i 
can't see what difference it would make. I guess it's there for a 
stronger join. remember the locking washer before fastening the nut.

15. reinsert into fuel tank and tighten the five 8mm nuts.

16. clean the connection points on the plug. I used a cotton tip (I 
think they're called q-tips in the us) dipped in WD40 and pushed it 
into the three connector holes. It came out filthy dirty so i think 
this was quite worthwhile.

17. attach plug to connector on sender unit.

18. reinstall trunk carpet

19. turn on ignition and see the fuel gauge jump to the 
correct reading!

This process is not going to be the panacea for every fuel gauge 
problem, but it's probably something you should do to at least get a 
better idea of what might be causing your problem
