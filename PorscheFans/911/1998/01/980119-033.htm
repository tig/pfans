Now that I have read all I can read, surfed the net and even seen a
disassembled engine, I am confident that I can perform the chain
tensioner update myself.  All I have to do now is purchase the parts and
wait until the warm spring breezes begin to melt the snow in order to
get the car out of storage or April 15th whichever comes first. 

 On to the questions for the group:

1.	Where should I buy the parts from?  According to the net and
catalogs the pricing ranges from about $325.00 to $560.00.  Some say
they are genuine and some don't.  Some may need additional parts and
some don't.  Some need special tools and some don't.  Any advice?
(lurking parts houses feel free to email me COMPLETE quotes including
the kit, gaskets, and ramps, I am ready to buy)
2.	What is the real deal with the chain ramps 6 black or 5 black
and 1 brown? 
3.	Is it worth it to adjust the cam timing according to my desired
power curve?
4.	At what point in the process should you change the chain ramps,
before or after the tensioners, chains loose or tight?
5.	Do I need the updated wheel supports also?  I think mine was
built in March of 1980.

Thank you in advance,

does anyone have any knowledge on the security system standard on 97 or 98 911
Carrera S; is it sufficient or is it necessary to purchase additional system
(i.e. Clifford Intelliguard); also, planning on adding Lojack; someone
mentioned that Lojack drains the battery; is this true; thanx
