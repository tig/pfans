Dear P-fans,

I would like to thank everyone who sent me their thoughts and advice
regarding my CA smoging and tuning difficulties of my 66 912.  I must
have received at least a dozen responses. 
I just wanted to let you all know what finally happened.  I took the
advice of many who responded and went straight to the DMV.  I handed
them my paperwork, with proof of insurance, and they gave me the 1998
registration card with plate sticker.  I just said thank you.  I can't
believe it was so easy, since my car failed a smog test and was declared
a "gross polluter" in 1997. 
I am so pleased to be driving my car again without fear of being stopped
for expired registration.  I have a gut feeling, however, that the fact
that my car was declared a "gross polluter will haunt me again someday. 
.....just a feeling.

Regards,

Michel Lauzon
