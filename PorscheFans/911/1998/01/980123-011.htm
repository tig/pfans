Mike, I did this myself, and it's no picnic.

If you can find a bare 993 decklid, grab it and keep the stock rear parts
intact.

If you decide to disassemble the rear grille, you will need to prop the lid
partway open, cover the entire engine compartment with a drop cloth, or
remove the whole thing entirely, remove the tail  motor, then disassemble
the tail raising mechanism piece by piece until you are able to tilt and
twist it out. It's a tight fit and tedious, and you will end up with a fair
number of little pieces (which you would be well advised to reattach while
you recall their proper homes). be sepecially careful of the microswitches
for sensing the tail position. They can easily catch on things and get
mangled.

It wasn't the most fun I've had with my car.

One other thing: the mechanism has an electrical connection with 4 prongs.
When you remove the mechanism, you'll have a connector with four female
plugs-- grouped in twos (raised and recessed) You will need to make up
short patch cords to short the two raised connectors together, and another
to short the two recessed plugs together. That way, your 993 computer will
'see' the tail down when you start up, and also see it up when you hit 52
MPH.

Good luck.
