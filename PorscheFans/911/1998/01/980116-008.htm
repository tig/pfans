I believe my 964 is rare - I have only had this car for three months.  =
Porsche GB were the first owners and it was featured in a US magazine =
(Connoisseur cars ???).  It is a 964 SuperSport Cab with a Turbo body =
and I believe Turbo suspension and brakes, definitely wide-bodied =
anyway.  Apparently (according to last owner) it did the motor show.  it =
also has a colour scheme which is unusual (Wimbledon green)=20

Any help withe more info would be appreciated - I have been told six of =
this model are in the UK.  Only c100 ever produced. mine is only colour =
style in RHD

regards
