Walt,
I will let you know what I did to get around my gearshift sticking. You say
you have discovered that the signal from the gearshift lever to the relay is
ok, but listen to this.

I was having intermitent gearshifting problems on my '74 - 911 Sporto. These
seem to be happening when the car warmed up. The clutch would not engage and
I had no power. It also got stuck in gears and I couldn't shift up or down.
After finding out that the gearshift switch was heating up and expanding
thus causing no contact and no clutch. I devised a new method using a
pressure switch (bought from a motorbike shop - a horn) mounting it to the
gear lever it works better and faster than the original switches and in some
respects is more comforable due to being able to hold the stick before
shifting. I was careful however, to leave the existing mechanism in place.

Also check the soleniod that drives the vacum...

Best Wishes
