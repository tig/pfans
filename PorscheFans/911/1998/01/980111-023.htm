I have a 1990 C4 Cab and the top doesn't seem to leak at all.  I have
been through torrential downpours, and not a drop came from the top.
There is some water that comes in somewhere under the dash, but I 
don't think it is related to the top at all.

I have only had the car for 4 months.  I don't know if the PO had
replaced anything.  Everything looks pretty original, though well
kept for 8 years old.

I don't know...
