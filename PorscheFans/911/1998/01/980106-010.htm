Hi,

'Fraid I can't help you with a broker's #, but I recently (August) purchased
a '90 C2 coupe, after looking for 8 months for an '89 Carrera coupe!

Two main factors went into my decision on the 964 versus the '89 coupe...
first, there were very few '89 coupes available in good shape up here (B.C.
Canada). Second, I was concerned about getting "2-foot-itis" - a sailor's
term for wanting that boat that's 2 feet longer than what you've got. With
the 964, I'm not concerned that I'll want something just that much better
in the near future.

The 964 comes with a newer engine & suspension, different shift linkage
(having driven a few '89 911s and the 964, there's no comparison in the
shifting feel). More power, marginally better handling (open to
interpretation!), far better HVAC. Whether you like the look of the 964
better is of course your personal preference.

On the downside, the 964 is more expensive, and there are fewer aftermarket
parts available. It's also heavier. Some people have an opinion that the 964
will not hold it's value as well as other 911 varients as it's an "in between"
car and was only produced for a few years (I personally don't care - I didn't
buy my car to flip...)

Things to watch out for in a 964:

- early rubber-centered flywheel prone to failure - should have been replaced
  with an LUK flywheel
- some cars had a tendency to leak oil at cylinder/head junction - car may
  have been updated with new cylinders/heads (mine was not updated and does
  not leak)
- early (pre '92) 964s had a problem with the internal distributor drive
  belt breaking (one side of the distributor drives the other side via
  a toothed belt) - later cars had a vent installed which removed ozone
  from the distributor housing. This is a cheap and easy upgrade.

Hope this helps... I'm tickled pink with mine!!!

Cheers,

Ross
'90 C2 coupe
