Yikes! Well, this may not be as bad as it seems. First, are you absolutely
sure the battery is recharged? It is unlikely that the starter saw 30 volts
if you did not turn the ignition on while the pwr supply was connected. The
radio, clock and alarm may be gone and the alarm may be what is keeping the
car from starting. I suggest verifying whether or not the alarm has
ignition cut-off and bypass it. Also, defuse the clock and radio and test
separately. These may be the only casualties--test carefully.
