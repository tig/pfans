Juha,

Two cents:

>I finally got the engine apart and couple of things bother me.
>Engine has over 120.000m and top has been open before.

>A. Chain wheel wear is odd. Idler wheels wear on outside and
    cam wheels on inside. This looking from pulley end of engine.
    Chain wheel mis-alignement?

The chain sprockets may have been flipped over when the last person did 
them.  they should go only one way because they have their own offset.  
Of course, a shim might not have been replaced.  In any case, the 
sprocket offset to the engine needs re-measurement/resetting.

>B. How to determine if chains worn, these has been changed as
    they are split type.
    Should I change them anyhow?
Don't know, but those sprockets were chewing on them a bit.

>C. Chain ramps very brittle, like glass. I change them.
    Overheated?
When I got a few new ones, they felt about the same hardness (replaced 
only broken or cracked).

>D. On two cylinders the bottom copper gasket was pulling out.
    All head studs are OK.
    How can this be avoided?
Maybe keeping an eye down there when the heads are getting pre-torqued.

>F. Piston pin lock rings.
    Should these be replaced or can they be re-used?
They aren't in a bad wear spot.  The oil stains on the wrist pins 
should tell you if they don't move much.

>G. Piston ring end gaps 1st 0,55, 2nd 050, 3rd 0,60.
    Side clearance OK.
    Engine leakdown around 5%, except leaking #6.
    Should rings anyhow be changed?
Identify the piston type Kolbenschmidt, or Mahle.  Porsche used a lot 
of KS on latter 3.2's.  Rings are different for each type and KS are 
regarded as inferior for not having the nikasil liners.  The re-ring 
debate centers on whether you risk new rings that don't seat, or cure 
ring leakage, but, in my very limited experience, the majority re-ring 
(not too much oil!).  I thought the <.004" ring land to ring clearance 
was more critical than end gap.

>H. Cyl. #6 show some wear on exhaust seat due to loose
    valve guide. Measuring with old valve from bearing surface
    of valve spring shims to valve stem is 45,8. Tech spec book
    specify this as 46,0 +0,3 so this is out from spec. =

    I do not know if valves has been grinded before.
    What is the thickness of new valve head, so I could figure
    out if a new valve could correct this?   =
Not sure, machine shop did head work.

>I. Valve guides has to be replaced, but valve stems do not
   show any major wear, I have to measure them, this is visual.
   Should valves be replaced anyhow?
   Should valve locks be replaced also?
   Should retainers be replaced also? =
Visually worn/shaped valve stems would be pretty grotesque, especially 
considering that the guides wear first.  Measure using the tech spec 
book then decide.

>J. I had no plan to split the case.
   Should I open one CR to check the bearing?
Some think the bottom is good for 250K, feel lucky?  The valves/guides 
take the punishment on the 3.2 motor. 

>I wan't to do a proper repair, but see no reason for changing parts
>just for nothing and looking for advice. 
I wouldn't argue with this philosophy for a split second.  You, 
obviously, know a thing or two and can get back in there on the OFF 
chance something goes wrong. 

Good luck,
Chris Woodward
