Hello everyone,
 I swapped out the DME relay and the car starts just fine.  The symptoms before 
replacing the relay were:

Car will turn over but will not start.  The interesting thing is after turning 
the ignition to off, there is this loud clicking sound that emanates from behind 
the dashboard of the car, almost exactly like the sound you get when the turn 
signal lever is depressed.  It goes away after a few minutes.  When you try to 
start again, the same thing happens. 

Please, please, PLEASE learn from my problem and stock your glovebox with a 
spare DME relay (~US$50).  MAKE SURE YOU DISCONNECT THE GROUND FROM YOUR CAR 
BATTERY FIRST, as I am pretty sure the relay is "hot." It is a black module that 
is located underneath the driver's seat, held in place by a 10mm nut.  To unplug 
it after you have loosened the nut, slide the driver's seat all the way forward 
and unplug it by reaching in from behind the driver's seat.  
 
Special thanks goes to Kevin Gross, who in mid-1995 warned the now-defunct 
Porschephiles group about keeping a spare DME relay in the glovebox.  It saved 
me an embarrassing emergency ride home from my wife, who works across town.

				Jason Savage
