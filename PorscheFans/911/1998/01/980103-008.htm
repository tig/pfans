Hello All,

Ive just installed a factory short shift kit on my 80SC Targa and am 
wondering if anyone has experience with this. There seems to be an awful 
lot of pressure between the ball and the shift rod head. I had to apply alot 
force to get the shifter installed.  I know the idea of the whole thing is to 
provide tighter, more accurate shifting but something tells me its just not 
right. Maybe Im just paranoid having just bought the car. 

The shifter seems to be forced to either side of the box. ie: lined up with 1st 
& 2nd or
5th and rev. It takes alot of effort to guide it to the center to shift into 3rd & 
4th. This is because the ball end is at its tip(highest point) in the socket 
when its in the center and on its side when lined up with 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 
rev. 

Also, when I removed the original, I thought I remembered the ball being 
inside the ball socket (plastic piece) but I cant say for sure. With the new kit, 
the ball rests on top of the socket and shift rod head.

Any help greatly appreciated!
