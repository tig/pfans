This legislation really isn't intended for the "sports car" crowd.  I bet it
is aimed more at the 4WD folks (of which I am more or less a part).
Many people have been known to dangerously alter their suspensions
in the pursuit of clearance for bigger tires (again - the 4WD stuff).  These
backyard mods sometimes result in broken steering linkages, exploding
u-joints and even complete failure of the suspension itself.

FWIW, I believe some states already have this legislation in effect
(I think one of the states is Wisconsin), and it's really nothing new.  This
has been going on for years...
