I have a 72 911 that I autocross and an 85 911 that is my daily 
driver. The 72 gets limited street use. I run R1's on the 72 and I 
have driven it to and from events frequently. I found the R1's to be 
great tires in the wet and dry and they cost considerably less than 
"regular" street tires. I ran some Kumho R type tires on the 72 for a 
while. I went back to the R1's and put the Kumhos on the 85. They are 
very good in the rain and in the dry. They are cheaper than the R1's. 
My experience has been very good with the "race" tires on the street. 
Just a data point. BTW I live in Arkansas where it rains quite 
frequently.
