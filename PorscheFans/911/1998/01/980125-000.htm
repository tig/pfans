It certainly is possible to defeat a camera with flash by spraying on
something which will reflect light.  However, the radar guns which take
the photos are too far away from the car for the flash to do any good. 
Flash will only illuminate a subject up to about 50 feet max (you
professional photographers can give a more exact distance).  When you
see flash bulbs go off at a football or baseball game, they are doing
nothing to enhance the photograph of the field because they don't carry
far enough.  Most often, people will be disapointed because their
pictures are too dark.  Same principle for the radar.  Smokey would need
a spotlight to illuminate the license plate in the dark.  Now in the
daytime, it is different.  You do not need a flash and so a coating
which reflects back the flash in the day will do you no good.  In
essence, I am saying that this stuff is probably not worth it.  Just my
02 cents worth.
