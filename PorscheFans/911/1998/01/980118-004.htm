I've taken several different vehicles to Monterey from a converted van to a
35 ft motorhome (and have seen larger ones there). There is a permanent
campsite at the track with hookups but that is full long before the weekend
begins, although if you were going for the 356 Holiday the weekend before,
you might be able to get a spot. That is the best bet.

SCRAMP who manages the track has a habit of changing things from year to
year so you can't count on last year's experience being applicable this
year. There have been designated areas for camping/RVs, most recently for
me opposite the pits outside the track at the bottom of the hill. As I
recall, SCRAMP offers reserved sites which people take so they can be along
the fence, and the remaining spots are available on a drive up basis.
SCRAMP camping fees also make the normal RV park operators look like
pikers, but compared to $159 .......

Absolutely give them a call. If you don't have a brochure (I can't find
mine) get their number from the Monterey Tourist Bureau and you can get the
details.

Bottom line is that taking a motorhome is a good idea, as long as you can
last without the hookups (there are facilities for campers) or get into the
campground.

Thanks to everyone who offered there opinions on the painting options of my 72
Targa 6 months ago.  (Glass in or out quandry)  The shop did a great job and
with all new trim the car looked great.  Past tense because Daryl and his
brother Daryl shipping company did a number on the car between CA and FL.  I
have a couple of experience questions for those of you running with the Crane
HI-6 CD ignition set-up.  I am considering this upgrade for my 72 with Webers.
Also, is PMO still in existance, I haven't seen any adds lately and would like
to get a carb rebuild kit.  Next, has anyone added an external oil cooler to
their cars, which unit, how hard was installation, cost???  Lastly, I have
seen previous posts about fogged instruments, several of mine need some help,
but for the life of me I can't see how to get the things apart.  How expensive
is it to have this done by one of the repair shops, and how long does it take?
Thanks.
