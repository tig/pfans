I run 21mm front, 27mm rear torsion bars and 22mm front/rear adjustable
antiroll bars.  My car is not flared so I'm running 225/50R15 on 7x15
all around this season (I rotate f/r for longer life).   This suspension
setup works great for track/autox.  Since my car is also street driven,
I 'only' run 1.5 deg negative camber and still get more tire wear on the
outside, not the inside as you might think, I guess due to all the hard
cornering.

Hope this helps,
