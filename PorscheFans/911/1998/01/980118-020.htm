From personal experience, in a cabriolet, a remote mounted radar might
be a good choice.  Remote radars have a weatherproof antenna/receiver
mounted behind  the bumper or grille. The inside portion is just lights
and buzzers and can be mounted below the dash or hidden. The  advantage
is that theft becomes a lesser issue,  Dash mounted detectors are high
theft items and must be removed when the car is parked (especially in a
cabriolet where access is just a  $2000. top slash away).  Brand names
to check out include Bel (615stir) and K40. The Bel unit works well and
is widely available, only draw back is that the laser receiver is not
waterproof and has to mount behind rear view mirror.  The K40 is more
expensive but offers a unique speeding ticket warranty. They also offer
different versions with multiple f/r receivers, and custom installed
models where all the lights and speakers are integrated into the car.
K40 units are usually available at higher end car audio shops.
