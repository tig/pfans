Hi Mike,

we already thought of this application and have solved most of the
technical problems.  The major problem of GPS loss of satellite coverage
is overcome using a dead reckoning system to track the vehicle until GPS
coverage is re-acquired.  

Here is a link to some information on the product concept you are
working on.  Check out the GPS/Cellular messenger and Placer 450
products. http://www.trimble.com/products/pd_tc01.htm

I was trailing one of these systems recently on my wife's car. It has
four controllable outputs and four inputs that can be monitored from the
tracking system office.  Not only could I observe things like oil
temperature and other information, but I could lock the doors as the car
approached her favorite shops.  I never got around to activating the
brakes as she went past the beer shop though.

As a relatively new Porsche owner (6 months) and list neophyte, I turn to the
sages on the list for advice. I have a 1990 C2 whose oil pressure gauge, which
has a scale of 0-5, recently began to indicate maximum pressure at all times-
ie. it remains pegged at just over 5 regardless of the engine RPM. The problem
is electrical in nature. By turning the ignition on, and without starting the
car, the gauge will immediately jump to this maximum position. Obviously
without the car running it should indicate no pressure. The gauge has had
momentary relapses where it will again work fine, but unfortunately at this
time it appears intent on remaining inoperable. Is the oil pressure sending
unit going bad? Loose wire? Where is the thing located at? Perhaps the gauge
itself is going bad? How do I check these items? I assume it must be a fairly
simple circuit and relatively easy to check, however I have no wiring
diagrams. Any advice whatsoever is greatly appreciated!
