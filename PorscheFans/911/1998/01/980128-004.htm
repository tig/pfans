Guys,

I really, really, really don't understand what you are moaning about.
Here in the Netherlands the tax on a new car (or motorcycle) is 45.2%.
A new 996 costs over 230000 dutch guilders (=$115000), so as far
as I am concerned in all other countries it's a bargain. There is one
exception which is Denmark. Apparently Denmark has a 100% tax
on new cars.

Paul
(This also explains why I drive a 944 and not a 911 although I also 
have to admit that the 996 is the first 911 I really like, watercooled 
at last!).
