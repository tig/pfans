I had this conversation last weekend with Lee, from Motormeister, the
Porsche engine rebuilders (562) 401-3673.

If you are keeping the MFI, you need to keep in mind that 'space cams' in
the injection pump are different for each cam profile. The Solex cam
profile is probably the best compromise for retaining punch in the midrange
and a horsepower peak you can use around town, but the cost of updating
your injection pump is an unknown. If you go to'E' cams (like I am) it's
probably going to be $600 or so. I was lucky enough to find an 'E'
injection pump and save myself a bunch of bucks. The throttle bodies and
most other parts are the same for your 'T' as for the 'E'.

Another reason not to go with the 'Solex' profile is that it will have to
be ground on a set of MFI cams that have not been re-profiled already.

If you are going to Webers, disregard all the above.
