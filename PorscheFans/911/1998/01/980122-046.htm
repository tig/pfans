Subject: Restoring faded lenses

In answer to Chris's question re his '72, a long time back, I remember a
hint from one of the experts in Pano (could have been Paterek, but I'm
not sure) about restoring color in faded turn signal and/or taillight
lenses.

The hint was to get translucent paint from an art supply
store--evidently it exists in orange and red--and coat the insides of
the lenses.  I've never seen the product, but supposedly this restores
color to like-new condition.

Has anyone out there done this?  I've never had the need, but I
distinctly remember reading the item.

Re John Watson's assessment of his '74 interior, I remember seeing stock
interiors with this scheme:  tan lower panels with black on top.  The
treatment carried over to the rear shelf and the top of the panel behind
the rear seats.  The change to all tan came with '75, the year of my
car.

John:  I'm also doing an interior change.  I'm changing from tan to 
black.  The dash, door trim, & rear window trim are still tan.  Alot of 
people have commented that they like the look.  If you want to keep the 
2-tone interior, I think you'll be ok.  My car is a 78 SC targa Guards 
Red.  I am going to change to all black.  I am going to replace the door 
trim items and will probably dye the dash. If you are interested in 
possibly trading your dash let me know.  Mine is vinyl and in excellent 
condition.  Also if you have black rear seats I would be interested.  
Again, possibly a trade.  Send me a message or feel free to call 317 839

shatter the now brittle deadening material.
    I'm not sure where Mike heard this, but it sounded reasonable to me and

Alex,

I rebuilt my 82 SC mirrors a few months ago because of the same problem.
It is fairly easy.  There should be a socket cap screw holding the base
to the door.  Unscrew it and remove the whole mirror assy. from the
door.  There is a nifty hollow bolt and spring combination that provides
the break away affect for the mirror that has gotten loose.  The hollow
bolt goes through the base and screws into the mirror shell (if I
remember correctly). You have to use a large Allen wrench to tighten
this hollow bolt.  

The problem arises when you realize that all the wiring for the power
mirror goes right through the middle of the bolt, which is where you are
supposed to insert the Allen wrench as well.  It does not take long to
understand that the wrench and wires can not occupy the same space at
once.  So, snip snip go the wires and you must pull them up into the
mirror assy.  

At this point I chose to take the entire thing apart by starting with
the mirror glass.  It will pry off if you are gentle with it but be
careful to also remove the heating element wires from the back of the
glass.  Then there should be 3 hex bolts/screws you can unscrew to
remove the mirror drive.  This is a sealed part with the thick rubber
edge attached to it as well.  All you are left with should be a metal
shell of the mirror and the hollow bolt/spring in the base.

Unscrew the bolt completely and clean all the parts.  Be careful not to
loose the plastic washers.  After cleaning apply a little multi-purpose
grease to the threaded end of the hollow bolt and screw it through the
base and into the mirror shell with all the plastic parts and spring in
their correct places.  Make sure it is tight and provides a good amount
of resistance to being rotated.  The object here is not to prevent
rotation but just make it hard so if some idiot smashes into your mirror
it will rotate instead of rip off your door.

Put the wires back through the threaded tube.  DON'T forget to put the
little rubber seal on the base now because if you solder the wires back
together then you will have to cut the seal to get it back on (when my
car was painted by the PO they did this BAD BAD).

Now, you have two options here.  You can permanently reattach the wires
or you can put in a connector in case this problem arises again.  I
personally put in a connector because I will be repainting the car again
(previous job REALLY sucked) and will have to take the mirrors off
again.  You can take a short run to Radio Snak and find some nice 6
pin(I think) connectors.  Don't forget to buy the pin removal tool as
well as the connector will not fit through the hollow bolt if you have
to rebuild your mirror again.

So, reconnect your wires and then bolt the base back to the door while
making sure that the seal is even all the way around.

DONE.

If you now have a vibration in your mirror and can not see anything in
it at speed then you might have front wheels that are out of balance or
have flat spot in them.  My mechanic told me this.


Have fun!

Subject: Black "crackle" paint for seat hinge restoration


     Am having the leather seats on my 73 T recovered and thought it might
be a good idea to repaint/restore the black hinge plates that connect the
seat bottom to the seat back on both sides of the seat.

     Does any body know how to accurately duplicate the textured black
coating on the stamped metal.  Is it a special paint?  Is there a textured
undercoat applied first.  Does it have to be done professionally or can I
do it myself so that it looks factory original?  In the event that I can do
this myself, do things come apart easily or are there a lot of rivets and
stamped connections?

     An unrelated social note:  Seeing Jon Lowe's comments on sportomatics
in yesterday's digest reminded me of times in the long past spent together
at OVR events and at Mid-Ohio.  Good to see you're still around Jon.  Still
have the yellow 911?

Subject: Re: Loose side mirrors
To: 911@PorscheFans.com

Alexander,

 I had loose mirror problems on my '89 Carrera similar to yours, where the
base 
is tight but the upper mirror assembly is loose.  The way I fixed it was:

1. Gently pull the mirror off its base. It may seem tight at first if the
mirror 
has not been removed for the life of your car.
2. There are 3 or 4 phillips head screws that hold the guts of the electric

mirror assembly to the outer shell of the side mirror.
3. The electric mirror assembly will now be hanging by the wires that
control
the motors of the mirror.
4. You should now see a couple more phillips head screws that were
previously 
covered up by the guts of the electric mirror assembly.  They may seem
tight 
already, but I found that backing them out a couple turns then retightening
them 
solved my loose mirror problem.  NOTE: there is another kind of loose
mirror 
problem that is caused when the nut that holds the hollow tube the wires
feed 
through comes loose. Automotion makes a kit to fix it for ~US50.  Luckily
this 
was not the cause of my problem.
5. Installation is reverse of above.

Subject: Support For B&B/Tri Flo

I certainly must concur with Mr. Cline's praise of B&B Fabrication,
makers of Tri Flo mufflers, etc...  After installing their touring
mufflers on my 1997 993 Coupe I ordered a cat-back exhaust system for
my wife's BMW.  In a colossal blunder on my part, I forgot to mention
that her car has an automatic transmission.  Since most normal in-city
driving finds her tach in the 2000-2500 RPM area, the rumble out the
back was decidedly unruly - driving by parking lots set off more car
alarms than an earthquake!  I promptly called Rob in customer service
(Dave is also most capable) who offered to fix the system and ship
it back gratis.  Understanding that the repair more than likely negated
any supposed horsepower gains, I was very pleased with their devotion
to customer support and satisfaction.  This past weekend I installed
a set of their bypass pipes on the newly acquired 1996 993 Twin Turbo
and was once again pleased with the quality of workmanship - and now
the turbo has a bit of a growl to match the acceleration!

Finally, all three exhaust systems were purchased through Jim at Winward
Performance.  I read some email not too long ago from a gentleman who
was not happy with his experiences there.  I must honestly say that
I've never been anything but 100% satisfied with their pricing, shipping,
and knowledge.  Felt it important that I share my views on this subject.

I'm a numbers guy for MCI (WorldCom?) Telecommunications and have no
ties whatsoever to either company, other than placing orders and having
fun with these toys!

Subject: tan interior, black trim

john hegelsen asks about a car with black dash and tan interior (i'd 
email him, but i'm on digest, and don't have his address).

one of the cars i considered buying had this interior.  i didn't actually 
see the car, but i did get several photos, one of which showed the 
interior, predominantly tan,with black dash and other trim pieces.  i 
thought it looked quite nice, and i might even consider doing it if i was 
refinishing a car.

john, if you send me your snail-mail address, i can mail you the picture.

Subject: retro-fitting Litronic lights to a 993?


	Has anyone any experience of the Turbo's Litronic lights?

	Are they significantly better illuminators than the stock
	993's lighting or is their installation just a "me too"
	affair?

	Also, how much does it cost (in labor) to install?

Subject: Windshield questions
To: 911@porschefans.com

I have some questions about removal and re-installation of my windshield.
I'm doing this because I need to replace my dash.  I have an 83 911SC.
I'm going to state everything the Haynes manual says on the procedure with
questions.

1: Fold the wipers forward, "then cut away the rubber seal from outside
the bezel."

Is the bezel the metal trim ?  Should I just dig a knife into rubber
around the outside of the metal trim ?  That's enough to get the
windshield out ?

2: "Carefully prize away the bezel then cut through the rubber seal
parallel to the windscreen ?"

I thought the metal trim should be removed after the entire assembly was
removed.  This sounds like it's saying to remove the metal trim first.

3: Remove windshield.

4: Scrape away remaining seal or sealant.  Fix any rust spots.

5: Get new moulding and smear a little soap and water solution into the
bezel groove.

Install the bezel so that there is approx. 0.4 in (1mm) gap at the top and
bottom in the middle.

??  Shouldn't I put the rubber on the window before inserting the metal
trim ?

6:  Place the moulding on the windscreen, and draw a piece of strong cord
into the moulding at the top so that the cord overlaps by about 12in
(30cm) in the top moulding.

??  I think I see what this does.  It is used to pull the inside of the
rubber seal around the sealing lip.  Mitchell Fieg posted a while back
that width of the string is important.  Why ?  Where should the ends of
the string end up before I start pulling ?

7:  Put glycerine on sealing lip and insert windshield at bottom.

8:  Slowly pull out cord so rubber lip is drawn over sealing lip of body.

9:  Slide center clips over metal trim.

10: Carefully prise the seal away from the metal, then from the glass,
then inject a mastic-type sealing compound.  Ensure that the bezel is kept
at an even distance from the windscreen aperture.

?? What is this all about ?  I don't get this at all.

Thanks for any advice.

Chris Cope

Subject: 911 engine/tranny for sale


I have a 2.2 911 engine and 901 transmission from a 1970 911 T for sale.
The engine is complete from the air cleaner and dual solex carbs with
linkage all the way down to the muffler.  Includes oil tank, cd,
distributor, etc. - everything from the engine.  The motor was running
when the car was parked 8 years ago, but is now 'froze up' from sitting
so long (right side of air cleaner was off, allowing moisture to get
inside).  The heat exchangers are a little holed, but the muffler looks
great.

Price:  $1500 for engine, transmission, engine gasket kit and 2 carb
rebuild kits.
Or would sell w/o transmission for $1200.
Will deliver anywhere in Texas, but otherwise shipping is extra.

If anyone thinks this price is way outta line, please let me know - I'm
just trying to get what I paid for this a year ago.

One data point from someone also in the SF/San Jose area (me) -- I settled
on
an '87 coupe a little over a year ago.  The used 911 prices here are higher
than most other other areas in the US.  From your description of the car, I
would place the price of an outstanding condition '87 Targa with 87k miles
at
around $24-$25k direct from the previous owner (wholesale), with dealer's
starting price (retail) 10-15% higher.  This would be near perfect
condition,
full service records, and obviously cared for extremely well throughout its
life.

If a dealer, or someone equivalent who bought the car from a seller and now
has
to make some profit, is offering the car for under $25k, I would say it is
either a pretty good deal or there is something possibly wrong with it.  I
wouldn't worry but no matter what, have it *thoroughly* checked by a
Porsche
specialist independent of the dealer and the car's previous history, and
picked
by yourself.  For service I would personally recommend either CT Automotive
in
Campbell or Heyer Performance in Mountain View, if you live in the Silicon
Valley area.  I personally place a high importance on meeting the previous
owner to assess their knowledge and care for the car, and full service
records.

Good luck!

Hey y'all,
	I've seen these devices advertised in magazines that claim to
"confuse" radar and laser guns, so that no speed registers as you whir by
a cop.  Anybody know if these things work, or if they're worth the
$200-300 price?  The ad says the company will pay for any speeding tickets
you get for the first year while using the device.  I'd be interested to

Hi all,
Please pardon the second post here, but apparently the first post was
jumbled for some readers, perhaps because I included my email address,
which
looks like a "link", and not standard text-only.
I'll keep this one very brief:  I build an enclosure for the 1974-1989 911
&
930, and I've been doing this part-time for the past few years, with about
250 sold to date.  This is a very economical and satisfying solution to the
lack of space for any attractive subwoofer options in these cars.  I build
each one personally by hand, and I personalize it with your name, my
signature, and the date.  Please email me for details and I'll also email a
picture of the installed enclosure.  The ad is also in Excellence Magazine.
Thanks, and again, please pardon my post if you're reading it a second
time...  <:o)

Hi Adnan.  They are junk...I saw a program on TV about them (it was one of
those late night news shows, either 20/20, Dateline, or 60 Minutes).  They
showed how great they worked when the radar gun was without about 10 feet,
but
anything over that and they didn't do a thing.  I don't remember the name
of
the company that was selling them.  I think they were based in Colorado. 
The
company also had the "we'll pay any tickets you get up to 15 mpg over the
speedlimit" guarentee, which the company refused to comment on how many
they
had paid.

I'd recommend getting a good radar detector like the Valentine One
(http://www.valentine1.com).

1975 911S For sale

Rust free, straight and unwrecked California car with an almost-dead
motor, 155K miles on the chassis. A great candidate for restoration or a
racecar conversion. This car is not suitable for use as is--it's
driveable, but isn't likely to stay that way for long. The drivetrain is
tired, and it's probably going to quit running in another couple hundred
miles. If you're looking for a driver, look elsewhere, if you want a 
project, this is the car...

Full details available on the web at:

Asking $3000. 

Contact Dirk Bergstrom, krid@unix.sri.com, 650.473.6853 (no later than

I have a 1971 911T and had a strange experience I hope someone can help me 
figure out.

I drove it to work the other day, even drove it for some shopping during 
lunch.
When it was time to go home I started it up.  It ran a little rough like
one 
cylinder was not firing.
Hoping it would smooth out as I drove I started home.  Looking in the 
rear-view mirror I was surprised to see a smokescreen a mile long.
We're talking James Bond style here.  I turned around and drove back to my 
parking space.  Most embarrasing.
After idling for about a minute it suddenly smoothed out and the smoke was 
gone.

Shrugging my shoulders, I drove it home without a hitch.  It was fine over
the 
weekend.

Any ideas to what happened?

I own a 1987 911 Targa.  I have owed many stick shift cars before but
none which beg to be driven like this one.  I have a few questions which
I would appreciate someone answering.  They will probably seem simple
but I don't know the answer.
1.  On a 3.2 Carerra engine, what is the maximum safe RPM you can go to
before dropping the clutch.
2.  When I say "drop" the clutch, I assume that you rev the engine to a
safe level and just yank your foot off of the clutch.  Am I right to
assume that?
3.  When you "drop" the clutch, should you start to give it even more
gas than the RPMs you use to get started or should I let the clutch
engage before giving it more gas?
	I do not want to tear up my engine or my clutch but would like to get
the most fun out of car.  Thanks for any help you can give me.  If there
is a place on the net which explains what I am asking for, please
advise.  Also, has anyone tried the mass flow sensor advertised by
Performance Products?

Subject: voltage regulator swap

looks like the alternator on the new car is toast (sigh).  my mechanic 
suggests i swap alternators with the old car, given my lack of funds 
after the car purchase.  i've got the alternator out of the new car, so 
the alternator part shouldn't be too tough.  the voltage regulator 
though...

i know that "alternator and voltage regulator must be from the same 
manufacturer", but i've never bothered to look for the regulator.  i'll 
be checking that bastion of knowledge, Haynes (hisssss), when i get home, 
but i'd love to get any tips from the gurus before i go to work.

* if i've got a marchal alt. in both cars, but different models, do i 
still need to swap regulators?

* where is the pesky thing?

* what sort of horror is involved in switching voltage regulators?

thanks for yer help.

Subject: Dropping Clutch

Jim Cunninghame asks about the proper procedure for dropping the
clutch on his 87.  Vol Spaulding cringes.  So do I.

The received standard wisdom is that dropping (or dumping or that even
more graphic description, sidestepping) the clutch on a 911 leads
promptly to dropping large sums of money on expensive repairs.  

I think it goes like this:  in big US V-8s the rear end is pretty light, so
if you
sidestep the clutch you spin the rear tires, which is enormously
satisfying to the driver and impressive to onlookers, what with all the
noise and smoke from the tires.  Because of the weight distribution, the
tires spin pretty easily.  Because they are spinning, they are not working
very hard at propelling the car forward, and as a result the drive train is
not under all that much strain, and the available torque is being
harmlessly (discounting the tires) wasted until eventually the tires do
hook up at the end of the desired black streaks of your tires' rubber on
the pavement, at which time the car is going fast enough that the system
can handle the torque.

Our cars have all that weight over the rear tires (60% of it, more or
less).
 Absent water or sand on the pavement, the tires don't spin under
acceleration, because we don't have NASCAR power levels allowing us
to light them up almost at will.  In short, they hook up pretty well.  If
you
rev the engine up to what - 3, 4, 5,000 rpm, and sidestep the clutch, you
put a huge load on everything because all that torque (4-5,000 would be
at torque peak for many of our cars) is being almost instantly applied.  So
you stand a good chance of breaking something in your transmission, or
maybe even in your engine.  Turbos have larger CV joints because they
are needed to handle their extra power.  I suppose axles could break, or
bad things (other than wear) could happen to clutch components (look at
what transmitts the torque from the outer housing attached to the
flywheel to the pressure plate some time). 

I think this lore may have started with the 901 style transmission in use
from 64-71, where the first gear hung out there on a shaft with a bearing
only on one side, and breaking the shaft there by overexuberant drag
race starts was not unknown.  Expensive part to break, both for parts
and labor.  Makes replacing a clutch look like peanuts.

Whether this remained true with the 915 and your G-50 transmission,
where first wasn't cantilevered I don't know from personal experience.

Nor do I intend to find out.

I have a suggestion for you, however.  Others on this list have driven
more 911s than I (the lucky dogs) and longer (I've been at it since 1984),
but my experience is long enough, I think.  The clutch disk I put in in
about
1986 or 7 I just measured, and it is close enough to the wear limit that I
am going to replace it, though I could get more out of it.  So my methods,
while perhaps not the best, can't be too bad for a daily driven car which
also sees autocross, driver's ed, and Club Race use.  

Start your 911 like you would any car with a clutch - rev it up a bit, ease
the clutch out and match things with a bit more gas as needed until it is
rolling and fully engaged, then do whatever you want.  Clutch will live,
drivetrain will live, tires will live, etc.  You won't be slow off the line
at
the stop lights either.

Where there is a viable reason to increase your initial launch speed, as
at the start of most autocrosses, nothing particularly bad seems to
happen if you start as you usually would on the street, just with a bit
higher initial rpm and a bit quicker easing out of the clutch.  In essence,
you are slipping the clutch more to get the rpm at full engagement up
higher in the torque range.  This isn't doing the clutch (and flywheel and
pressure plate) surface any particular good, but given the relatively few
times you do this, it doesn't look like it dramatically reduces the life of
these components.

What rpm, you ask?  Well, I think most do it by sound.  Maybe one of the
more thorough autocrossers has paid more attention and can enlighten
us.  But I don't think anyone "dumps" their clutch.

Subject: HELP!  Spark plug lost in the bowels of my 911!!!

  Today I attempted to change the plugs on my new ('83 SC) 
911.  Thanks to the information gathered here, the job went 
smoothly until cylinder #6.  I bought the 3" locking 
extension, but the Craftsman universal joint 13/16" deep 
socket didn't have the hole drilled to enable the locking 
mechanism.  I used the rubber insert for pulling the old 
plugs, then gently slid the socket (sans rubber insert) with 
the new plug down into the chamber.  On #6, the plug veered 
right and landed sideways.  I thought that the hole for the 
socket was round, but I guess not!

Next I pulled the upper valve cover to see where it went, 
because I couldn't feel it.  That said, the plug was way over 
to the right on the "finned thing" (oil cooler?)  You can 
tell I use the "quality" Haynes manual, as I cannot name any 
part of the engine!  I tried to fish it out with a long 
screwdriver and really lost it.  I went and bought a 
telescoping mirror and grabber. (the long thing you push the 
button on the end and the claws come out the other end)  With 
my snake light and mirror and everything I could poke around, 
but still couldn't see or feel it.  

I called my wrench and asked him what to do.  He said to pull 
the bottom valve cover to see if I could see it there.  Nope. 

My question is:  Because I don't know where the plug is, is 
it going to enter the engine, etc. or is it in an 
innocuous place and will eventually rattle out?  I don't want 
to have to tow it in and pay big $$$ to pull it out if at all 
possible.  

Any one else have this trouble, or am I the only one with bad 
luck and a negative IQ?

Thank You in Advance

Subject: A short history of brakes

Terry

A short history of 911 brakes up to the monster caliper era of the C2 and
newer (turbos excepted):

The brakes on our cars from 74 through 89 (end of Carrera 3.2) were
almost identical, front and rear, with one exception: For the Carreras
(84-89) the rotors were made 4mm thicker - from 20mm to 24mm,
because the cars had grown heavier and a greater rotor thermal mass
(they are heavier) was desired.  As a result, the calipers were also
made thicker by adding a spacer between the halves.  So you can use
the same pads for all these years.  However, you can't use Carrera
rotors on your SC (new brake pads wouldn't fit, rotor too thick for
caliper) unless you change over to Carrera calipers also.  Which would
be easy to do, but why?

Actually, the pad sizes go farther back:  the rear pad size (sometimes
called the M caliper size - your SC has M calipers in the rear) goes back
to the first 911 in the rear, and for some years (especially in the less
expensive T models) this size was also used in the front (and appeared
there on the 356Cs, and on some 914s).  The fabled aluminum S caliper
in the front took the same pad as the later cast iron A caliper you have
on your SC, although since the S caliper was a bit wider, proper S pads
are thicker when new than A pads, so they won't quite fit in an A caliper
(with a new, full thickness rotor).  This small extra thickness is also why
they cost a lot more.  Worn S pads fit fine in the A caliper, and new A
pads fit fine in the S caliper, they just approximate a slightly worn pad
in
that application.

I think all these calipers were made by ATE, a German brake firm.  I don't
think there are any Porsche part numbers on these calipers, but maybe
there are.  You don't need these numbers, however.  Nor do you need
the Porsche part numbers for the pads.

You can figure out a lot of this by looking at the catalogs.  Automotion
has a dandy table on rotor thickness over the years, but you can see a
lot of this interchangeability by looking for comparable brake pad part
numbers.  Oddities might include the Carrera pads, which have a wear
sensor connection (and so cost more and are given different numbers
by manufacturers who incorporate this feature, which not all the
aftermarket makers do).
