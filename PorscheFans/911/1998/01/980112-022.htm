This has vexed me too on my '87 but I don't have a solution (yet; not an ultra
high priority).  My mechanic tried one thing which was setting the idle fuel
mixture, which didn't help, but hasn't really delved in further.  I've heard
here and there about possibly a broken auxiliary air valve causing this, but am
unable to find this valve pointed out anywhere in the Haynes manual or in a Web
search specific to 911's.  There are some general references to such a valve. 
One is:

	http://www.forparts.com/fi.ht

which is a description of Bosch FI systems (Aux Air Valve paragraph quoted
below).

> AUXILIARY AIR VALVE
> 
> A) The auxiliary air valve opens a cross-sectional air bypass around
> the closed throttle blades to maintain an acceptable idle during cold
> engine operation. B) A precisely calibrated bi-metallic strip governs
> the cross-sectional area of an internal gate which meters the amount
> of extra air admitted to the engine during the warm-up period. The
> bi-metallic strip has its regulating time governed by the use of a
> ceramic heating element. AKA) Auxiliary Air Device, Auxiliary Air
> Regulator 

Another reference with some more debug info is

Search on this page for (misspelled) "AUXILARY AIR VALVE".
