.... but they should be CHEAP (at least, I'd think so!) - I'd personally
replace them... I don't know what type Porsche uses, but if they are
stamped pieces, the same rule applies as for chain master link clips - find
out which edges are sharp and have them facing out."

I agree with Ross as far as stamped retainers go, and this advice is
applicable to VWs using stamped retainers, and for any pistons which
have such (I had a set of Arias pistons for a 911 which used circlip style
retainers which I reused, and one of the damned ears broke off despite
fact there is no way any special force could impinge upon it, causing
disaster because piston design did not allow it just to drop into the sump,
etc, etc).  However, the stock stuff is just a spring clip forming about
7/8ths of a circle.  Because they are always pretty hard to get out and
back into their nice deep grooves, I deduce that they stay stiff and can
be reused.  I've had no trouble doing this, nor heard of any.
