The alternator provides the shaft for the engine fan and is tough to get to.
Measure alternator output by running the engine and measuring voltage
across the battery terminals.   Expect 14.1 volts.   If you get as little as
13.5 volts, the battery will be chronically undercharged and will not 
tolerate much idleness.
