Subject: 993 RS wing source

Hello,

    I'm considering a rear wing kit for my 97 993 Coupe. I like the
looks of one on Einmalig's (eminalig.com) web page under E-Ticket Ride,
also in the issue #45 pg. 54 on 911 & Porsche World. This wing is the
3.6 RS style if I'm not mistaken. Has anyone had any experience with any
of the "after market" wings of this type? Can you recommend a quality
source (BW Motorsports, AIR, Better Bodies, M. A. Shaw)? I would like a
quality 3.6 RS wing kit that does not require much work to achieve a
quality fit that can use the existing holes in the engine cover where
the moveable wing fits. I realize I'll need to prep and prime the wing
before painting. Do I have to worry about the wing rubbing against the
engine cover and leaving "marks" should I want to return to the original
factory moveable wing? Also, does anyone have any experience with chrome
993 17" Cup wheels, where can I get this done and how much will it cost
to have my wheels coated? Do they look good, or is this too much for the
car. What about Platinum colored anodizing?

    Thanks for the help,

    Mike Wyatt
