Greetings Pfans,

With all the talk lately concerning wheels and tires (and I figure you
guys, being the experts that you are, will know the answer to this one), I
have finally summoned the courage to ask a very stupid question that I have
yet seen to be addressed.  Basically, I (still) have the cookie-cutter
alloys that were on my Euro 1980 911SC when it was brought over in 1985.
For at least the last 10 years and two sets of tires I have been unable to
keep air in the front tires.  Depending on the weather, the rear always
hold pressure, yet the front will both leak down in a matter of a week of
two (or faster).  When the last tires were put on (Yokohoma something or
others) the tech got a wire brush and cleaned off the front rims after I
mentioned that they always leaked.  As I recall, there was some rubber
stubble on the rims where the tires make contact.  However, even with the
new tires (now approx. 5 yrs old) they still leak down such that a normal
part of my drive routine consists of checking tire pressure and refilling
before I drive anywhere.

On Car Talk several years back a caller had a similar question and was told
that since these wheels are alloys and are on the front and, therefore,
take the brunt of potholes, road objects (including for me a small deer
[previously hit] one night in the backwoods of Virginia - a real mess),
etc., the wheels get "out of round".  Is this true?  What can I do besides,
obviously, taking out a loan and buy new wheels?  Is there anything that
can be done to the tires/rims?  Any suggestions?

Thanks for the help!

Rob
