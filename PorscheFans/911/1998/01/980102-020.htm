Does anyone have experience with the Europroducts Stage I chips,
either in general or specifically for an '88 Targa?  They are selling
for $150 and claim 12HP.  Too good to be true?  I thought late
Carreras ('87-'89) already had better chips and that is why they have
a little more rated power than the earlier Carreras.  Please comment
on whether this upgrade is worth it for street driving.
Thanks,
Colin O'Keefe

Profile on DejaNews of this guy for a good chuckle).

I work with a company that makes their own chips. To read about the
performance characteristics, I invite you to check out
http://www.porsche-911.com/html/performance.html. The price in the ad
is $198.00 and not $369.00 like our competitors because we make our
own chips. Don't get ripped off! If you respond to me directly at
spoonbender@earthlink.net I'll sell for $150.00 flat. These are
brand-new chips! This deal goes for anybody else who might read this
message too! We have 'em for 944's too. I think the chips are the
fastest, easiest, and safest way to realize performance gains. Give it
a try, our customers are all satisfied. Thanks for listening!
