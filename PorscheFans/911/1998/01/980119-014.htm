Chris,

> Does anyone have an opinion on the Sportomatic Transmission ('70 911)?

I drive a '73 911E Targa woth the sportomatic. For "regular driving" its
fine, especially if you drive a lot in town. For real sporty driving off
course it can no way beat a manual.

Basically the sportomatic combines a regular gearbox (but with different
gearing) with a torque converter you find in an automatic. The clutch is
operated by a servo system which is operated through two switches at the
bottem of your shift stick. So when you change gears, the switches are
triggered and the clutch engages and disengages. The torque-converter
"eases" the whole process and also allows you to "stay in gear" when you'=
re
at a stand still.
The gearing is such that you normally only engage second, third and fourt=
h.
first gear is either for very slow driving are blasting off.
Because of the torque converter and the changed gearing you loose
performance.

I think the gearing of the 70-sportomatic is different from that of the 7=
3.
A list member from South Africa reported about this a while ago and was
looking for 72-73 gearing which supposedly is better.

I don't know about reliability/spare parts. I've been driving mine now fo=
r
about three years and have had no problems at all (with the sporto that
is). =

One possible advantage in this respect (just my own opinion/whisfull
thinking) could be less wear on clutch, cv-joints etc. because of the
"no-slip" clutch engagement and smoother power build-up in the drive trai=
n.

My next 911 however will not be a "sporto". You really lose some of the
excitement of the "911-experience" and I am thinking of changing the car =
to
manual (any experience here are welcome). However it is not a bad system
though and the price should be lower than a manual (although if you want =
to
sell it later .......)

Good luck,

Anyone have any photo of a 911 with a tan interior, but black trim and dash
parts.  I've been taking out my interior for it's upcomming paint job and am
trying to decide what to put back in.  I don't want an all black interior and
was thinking of just going with the complete tan interior, but I'm finding it
difficult to find good replacements.  Any suggestions or photo's out there.

I've already got a black replacement dash, but was going to dye it to the
propper color.

Thanks

I'd like to install a four point harness in my 993 for use primarily at
driver's ed events.  I do use a four point harness in my other car for street
driving (and driver's ed events) as I find that I slip around on the leather
seat.  In that car, I was able to easily install a Schroth harness using the
mounting points for the rear seat seatbelts.  My 993 has sport seats.  I'd
appreciate input from those of you who have installed harnesses.  Which
harness and how do you do it?   I'd prefer to do it without drilling, if
possible.

Thank you.
