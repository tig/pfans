Many thanks for your message.
Over the weekend I put in new Bosch platinum plugs.  The thread which I
feared was messed up may have only been dry or corrupted with some junk.
I carefully threaded the new plug, with copper anti seize, in and out a
few times by hand and it seemed ok.  The proof I think was in torquing
the plug.  It torqued just fine.  I am assuming that all is well now.
I remove the plugs to do the valves.  Just put a shop rag, clean, in the
well wear the plugs go and be careful.  With the plugs out the engine
turns with the spanner from the tool kit very easily.
Again, thanks.
WSC

	Sometime ago there was discussion about this on 914 list and I
dug 
	up from my own archives what I wrote then.

	Noted some discussion regarding different thread repair /
strenghtening
	used in Al-parts. We have repaired spark plug threads in our
drag race 
	engine, solid billet heads (WAR), with both HeliCoil and Wurth
"sleeves". 
	I don't know what is the correct name for these. These Wurth
things are 
	easy to do as the tap has first a regular spark plug thread that
guides 
	the tap straight. Then the hols is re-threaded to a new, bigger
diameter. 
	A sleeve is mounted with a special tap that "knurles" or expand
this 
	sleeve to the new threads. I feel these are better than helicoil
as it has 
	the guide in tap and there is a small shoulder witch come flush
to spark 
	plug sealing surface. Conical seal is something else.

	Now the reason for this posting, we run our DR engine with
methanol and 
	this don't color the plug, also the run is short abt. 6 sec, so
no time for
	that. 
	We check the cyl. temperature by reading how the coating of plug
is burned 
	off, yes we have a lot of plugs used only for one run, start +
6sec. run.

	When a sparkplug thread is repaired with any method, except
welding, the 
	heat transfer is disturbed and the heat is not tranferred off
the plug as
	from 
	an "original" thread = plug don't cool, your plug run hotter and
the
	reading 
	of plug is not accurate.

	I would think this is somewhat important in an aircooled engine
and perhaps

	there is a risk of detonation when "regular heat range" plug is
used in a 
	non-welded repaired spark plug threa.

	To sum this long story, try to repair original thread, use a
spark plug
	thread
	repair tap, or You can make one by making a cut with saw in a
regular plug.
	File the cut smooth, and run this in threads. The cut in plug
will clean
	threads,
	and junk can collect in the groove. Clean often while doing
this.

	Regarding valve adjustment, somebody on this list made a valid
comment of
	NOT remowing spark plugs before valve adjustment. This is so
possible dirt
	can not fall down from plug end between exh. seat & valve and
give a false 
	reading of valve clearance.

	Porsche to my knowledge do not recommend using antisize in plug
threads,
	my experience say, use O2 sensor safe stuff. 

	Sorry for long posting
