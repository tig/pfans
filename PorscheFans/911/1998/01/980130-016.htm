This is my first message to the list.  I would appreciate any advice
regarding the following:

I own a 1981 911SC with 65K miles which is in very good shape with one
"slight" problem.  My mechanic informs me that I have a broken engine head
stud which necessitates the replacement of all of the studs.  I am also
aware that certain other work should be performed at the time of the
replacement.  I have read that this repair can cost from anywhere from
$2,000-$6,000 -- which is fairly significant given the cost of the car.  I
would appreciate advice from anyone who has had this repair performed as to
what to watch out for.  I would also appreciate any advice regarding
mechanics in the Boston area, as I want to make sure I have the best person
perform what sounds like a complex repair.

Thanks in advance.

- Jeff C.
