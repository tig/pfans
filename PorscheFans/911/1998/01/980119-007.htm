Hi Brian;

>I realize this may be an easy one, but I need some help.  I was testing
the
>compression on a recently purchased 88 Cab.  I was able to get to plugs
1-5,
>but the position of #6 (far right) is really awkward.  Is there some tri=
ck
to
>getting to this last plug?

Use the original spark plug tool that came with the car. It look rough, a=

socket
made from pipe, a swivel joint with a spring and a knurled top. You need
also
a 10mm allen wrench for this. =

Take the air filter cover off, this might help.

Actually I am puzzled about this limited access thing, my hands are quite=

big (#11), but there is no problem to access the plugs in my -85.

>Do you have to remove the oil line to the rear hood.  It looks like that=

may

is
re-

Whoa, Brian. THIS IS NOT AN OIL LINE! DO NOT OPEN IT.

The line You describe is a part of the A/C system. The thing that look li=
ke
an oil cooler in rear hood (engine lid) is actually a condenser for the A=
/C
system. There is refrigerant under pressure, propably R12, and releasing =

that in the atmosphere will put You immidiately on the "Green People" =

black list. (Ozone depletion). R12 is also quite expensive today.

Do not open those lines, even if Your A/C do not work, it is best to keep=
 =

all lines closed so dirt can not go in, Someday You might want to fix it.=

Refrigerant lines are sealed with O-rings, and they have to be replaced
and lubricated every time a joint is opened.
