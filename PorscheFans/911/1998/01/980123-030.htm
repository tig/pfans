I have a 77 911s. I am not getting any spark from from the ignition
coil. I have since replaced the coil, distriutor cap, rotor cap, all
spark plug wires, spark plugs, and the CD unit.
I am getting power to the CD unit from the battery (middle pin on the 3
pin connector). 
I suspect there is a short between the CD unit and the coil.
4 weeks ago I was driving and the car back fired and stalled. The car
would not start. I have been having fuel line problems at the time (they
have since been fixed). I let the car sit over nite and it started the
next day.
In addition, my RPM gauge needle has been swinging wildly while I drive.
I suspect that the RPM sensor is faulty.
My questions are:
1.  Am I missing anything along the circuit (from the battery to the
coil)?
2.   Are there any other components I'm missing?
3.  Does the RPM sensor have anything  to do with this problem?
4.  HOW CAN I GET MY CAR STARTED !?

We cut off the old crimp and hose and reband new hose with a high pressure,
