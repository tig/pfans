Speaking from motorcycling terms (where loading is obviously different),
you NEVER replace a sprocket without replacing the chain, and vice-versa.

Chain "stretch" is really wear of the pins underneath the rollers in the
chain. A "stretched" chain will VERY quickly wear a new sprocket.

Chains usually have "stretch" limits - the manufacturer may be able to
provide details. If it's over the limit, replace it. If you're not sure,
replace it!

Non-split chains are by far the best. Chains with a "peen-on" master link
are 2nd best, clip-on master link a distant third. If you have to use a clip-on
master link, there are 4 ways to install the clip, only one of them correct!

Obviously you want the closed part of the clip to face the direction of
chain travel. You also want to check the clip to see which way it was
stamped out - the edges on one side will be slightly rounded, and they will
be sharp on the other side. You want the sharp edges facing out.

.... but they should be CHEAP (at least, I'd think so!) - I'd personally
replace them... I don't know what type Porsche uses, but if they are
stamped pieces, the same rule applies as for chain master link clips - find
out which edges are sharp and have them facing out.

Cheers!
