Sure, Chris... Although it'd be a LOT easier if I could draw you a 
picture.

    Visualize your left-front wheel, as viewed head-on from the
    FRONT of the car.... NOT a side-view.

    Now visualize the upper and lower ball-joints... The upper
    ball-joint is further inboard than the lower ball-joint, so a
    line drawn through them would slant from lower-left to
    upper-right.

    Ok so far?  Draw that line, and extend it downward until it
    intersects the ground.  Call that intersection point "B".

    Now draw a vertical line through the center of your tire, all
    the way down to the ground.  Call THAT intersection point "T".

    The "scrub radius" is the distance between T and B.  If B is
    outboard of T, you have negative scrub radius; if B is inboard
    of T, you have positive.

    Zero scrub radius (also known as "centerpoint steering") happens
    when B and T are at the same point.

If you think about the forces that act on the front tires, you'll see 
that:

    1.  You generally want a little bit of negative scrub radius for 
        stability... If one wheel loses traction, the steering tends
        to self-correct.

    2.  Street-driven front-wheel-drive cars want more negative scrub
        radius, so that the steering self-corrects if one wheel
        loses traction under acceleration.

    3.  Front-wheel-drive RACE cars want less negative scrub radius, 
        so they'll be easier to steer when you apply power while in a 
        turn.

    4.  As the scrub radius gets larger, you get more kickback in 
        the steering wheel.

    5.  As the scrub radius gets smaller, it takes more effort to 
        turn the wheel while the car's moving slowly (like when
        you're parking)... The required effort is highest with zero 
        scrub radius.
