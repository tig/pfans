> Basically, we take one frozen lake (10"+ of ice), arrange 
> a closed course (with optional snow banks), add some 
> timing equipment, provide a warm place to sit and observe 
> (the condo overlooking the lake), line-up the participants, 
> and then run some hot laps! It is unbeliveable fun!
> 
> Note to all scuba fans: we do not need your
> services - if there is any chance of seeing
> water, we do not run!
