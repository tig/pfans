Hi All! Just joined this list today. A great resource. 

I own a 1975 911S which has a 1974 2.7, CIS engine in it. This has been
my daily driver now for the past 11 years. Very reliable car.

Last week heard a realy NASTY ($$$$$) clicking sound come from the
engine on my way home. Performance did not seem to be affected.
Continued home keeping my fingers crossed. It sounded much like
excessive valve to rocker arm clearance on other cars. When I got home I
listened to the noise with the engine running. Seemed to be comming from
the left side closest to the rear. Shure sounded like bad valve
clearance or sticky valve. Pulled off the valve covers checked all the
clearances and watched while rotating the engine by hand....NADA,
everything checked out good. Closed it up and put some of the stuff to
unstick the valves in the crank case. Let it run for 5 minutes...still
no change in the sound.

 Pretty desperate now. Drained the oil and pulled the left timing chain
cover. Couldnt see anything wrong, nothing physically broken. Never felt
a bad tensioner, so didnt know if what I was feeling was good or bad.
Could, with one hand, easily depress the tensioner and it came right
back up. Disconnected the ignition and let my son crank it while I
watched. LO AND BEHOLD...there it was! The tensioner, apparently with no
oil but just the spring, was slamming up and down as it fought the
tensioner on the other side. THANKFULLY a previous owner had the
foresight to put guards on both of the tensioners. 

I am now waiting to get the 84 tensioner update kit that I ordered from
Vertex. BTW they seem to have the BEST prices around. The kit from them
costs $324 VS $449 from Performance Products and $529 from Tweeks. (Not
associated with Vertex in any way, just a VERY satisfied customer)

While installing this update kit I am contemplating replacing my leaky
oil return tubes with the colapsible type. Has anyone done this? Are
they difficult to install?

Regards, Rudolf Salomon

Hello All,

     I wanted to jot down a few lines quickly to express an opinion.  I have
noticed recently all the conversation about Windward Performance.  Everything
which I have read has been negitive and I am wondering if perhaps someone has
an ax to grind.

     My experience with Windward has always been professional, courteous and
helpful.   Items which I have pursched have been correct, priced properly and
delivered in a timely fashion.  I have spent a moderate sum with Windward for
my 89 930, (headers, turbo and Intercooler).  Everything has been as
represented, and the experience has been pleasant . . . contrary to my
experience with some mail order Porsche establishments.   Obviously there was
a problem with communication, but I have never had that problem.

     Additionally, one of the loudest protestors I believe is Alan Coleman.
Well, Alan, I am not sure I would put merit into anything you discuss . . .
and here is the reason why . . . I also own a 93 RS.   I read your article
concerning adjusting the potentiometer switch on the DME box's.   Boy do you
have a wrong number!   Yes, that switch is adjustable, if you know which way
to turn it, and which number box you have....every series and year box is
different.  I.E., a 93 doesn not adjust as an 91 does, and so on.    To listen
to you, they are all the same.       hmmm.          .wrong move.  I am
wondering how many individuals have damaged their engines with this
misinformation.   Seems Alan, if you care to become the town crier and smack
someone down, he without sin should cast the first stone, and perhaps not live
in a glass house.   Just my thoughts, wanted to share them.

Glad you had good luck with Windward Dave.  Too bad you didn't notice the part
where I said "I'm sure there are lots of people with good experiences with
Windward"  My post was to see if others were haveing problems.  Turns out
there are!  One of those was a Master Porsche Mechanic.  Let's assume he knows
how to order a part.  It took a Windward rep three trys to get it right.
Another turbo owner received  3.2 parts for his turbo.  Had to argue to get
the right parts and not pay restock/extra fees.

I'm not sure what advice on a DME setting has to do with someone running up an
unauthorized charge on my credit card has to do with all of this.  But I'll
respond to the DME post.

Yep a 91 box is different than a 93.  In July 91 the Bosch No. changed to
0261-200-473.  I have and use a late 91 box in my 93RS.  The Porsche part
number is different but the Bosch number is the same.

As to changing a setting and destroying an engine if you don't know what you
are doing don't do it.  I tested mine with a chassis dyno.  By the way, no one
wrote to tell me of a damaged/blown engine.

PS.  Dave, if you want to make your RS go slower I have nice $400 chip for
you.  Dyno sheet comparison to stock done on the same day to go with it.
Wouldn't want to break a window or anything.

Alan C,
