Porsche Fans,
    I drove up from San Diego to Los Angeles this past weekend to check =
out the new  996 and have mixed feelings at what I saw. Seeing all of =
the factory race cars was a real treat. I hate to say it but that was =
more exciting than seeing the next generation of the 911. Don't get me =
wrong, the car looks nice, but that was about it. To me it did not have =
the same "drooling at the mouth" feeling I got when I first got a chance =
to see the 993 twin turbo a few years ago. The Boxters looked great and =
the rest of the Porsche display was done really well. =20
    As a side note, if the crowd size at the new Volkswagen Beetle =
display indicates the amount of "bugs" they are going to sell, they will =
sell millions of them.:)
Overall I thought the show was great and look forward to getting a =
closer look at the 996 when it arrives in the dealerships in a few =
months.
