Gary, I produce the Automotion catalog. This week, we'r printing a brand
new one that has had the same language added. PCNA's lawyers forced us to
do so. As well as the disclaimer about 'images and descriptions of Porsches
being used for illustrative purposes only'. If Porsche had its way, there
would be nobody selling parts for Porsche but Porsche.

Tweeks, Performance and Automotion sell lots of parts they buy directly
from suppliers to Porsche, so the quality is identical. The modified
aftermarket stuff, of course, varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. Be
sure you buy from a reputable retailer who will take back parts that don't
meet your approval. And if you're in doubt about who makes a particular
product--like the stainless heat exchangers you mentioned--ask the
retailer. They should be willing to tell you. Finally, ask the list for
specific experience with the part. That's how I learned to avoid two of the
more popular muffler brands on the market...
