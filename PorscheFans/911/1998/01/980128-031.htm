This is a repost for those who didn't see it the first time.

I'm am trying to document for a customer of mine how early (mileage) the
dual-mass flywheels have failed.  

If anyone has experienced a failure, please e-mail me with the year and
mileage that it occured.  Also, how amny people have converted their
system to an alternative style.

I have a '90 C2 Cab.  I bought it in March, 1996, when it had 8800 (not a
typo!) miles on it.  When I had it checked out, I was told that it had a
defective flywheel, although the symptoms were very slight at that time. 
We adjusted the price and off I went.  I immediately got lucky and found a
993 clutch/flywheel assembly that had only a few thousand miles on it
for $600 (the owner was turning the car into a full race car, and was
putting in a leightweight racing setup).  I put it in my garage, where it sat
for a year, until finally, with about 15,000 miles on the car, the original
flywheel failed completely.  At that time I had the 993 assembly put in,
and it's been fine ever since (the car now has a whopping 33,000 miles
on it).

Hope this info helps.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
