Hello all,

I wanted to share this experience hoping it can help with trouble shooting
running problems.  This was in intermitent problem that drove me nuts for
way too long.  Here is what I wrote to the Robert Bosch Co. 

In March 95 I purchased a Bosch 0 450 903 fuel filter for my 74 911S
Porsche.  I installed it June of 96 and soon after began having minor
running problems.  As I was traveling most of the time, my use of the car
at that time was minimal.  However, every time I would use it the symptoms
got worse.  It was an intermitent problem until the end of August 97 when
it would not develop that extra power above 3800 rpm.  I took the car to a
shop in Denver and it was found that the filter screens in the fuel
injectors had become clogged.  A hole was punched in the screens and the
car came to life.  The fuel filter was cut open on a lathe and it was
noticed that it had lost it's bond in the canister and was not filtering
anymore.  

The source of this is surface rust in the tank but the filter should have
protected me.  
So now it's time to clean out the tank, flush all the lines, clean out the
fuel distributor, replace the injectors and filter.

I keep seeing reference to Excellence Magazine, yet I have not been able to
find it in any magazine store or on the web.  Does anyone know where they are
located or if they have a web site.  Thanks.
