Thanks for the info...

On the steering wheel, I just soak the leather in water for a few =
minutes, which makes it stretchy, and then stitch away.  Once the =
leather dries, it shrinks a tiny bit, making a tight fit.  I've not used =
any glue.

Wurth products are carried by Car Care Specialties 1-201-796-8300.  They =
list Wurth Rubber
Glue.

Also, someone wrote about re-covering their steering wheel a while ago =
and didn't mention
using any glue.  I got the kit and plan to do this, but don't have the =
directions in front of me.=20
Seems like you wouldn't have time to get the leather stitched up before =
the glue dried.  Any
comments from someone who has done this?

I usually do these types of things myself, but I have really been jammed up
for time.  Does anyone know what a reasonable charge for a valve adjustment
should be at an independent Porsche shop.  Thanks for your help.
