Pfans,

I have just discovered that the two ball joints and ties rod ends on my
1972 911's front suspension need replacing.  Is there any easy way for a
amateur home mechanic with minimal tools (such as myself) to get the old
ones off and replace with new the parts?  Does anyone on the list have a
list of steps to follow to do this?  Any special tools needed?

Also, unrelated, does anyone know where the mounting points are on a 72
911's rear parcel shelf for the fitting of rear lap-sash seat belts.  I
have looked both on the top side (covered in bituminous sound deadener)
and in the engine bay under the foam-coated sound deadener but can't see
any
factory fitted mounting points.  (I was told that there already is a
mounting point with hole etc there).  The reason for this is
that I have to fit rear belts here by law (unfortunately)...

Can anyone suggest a good brand torque wrench and what torque range 
needed for general P-car work?

Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
