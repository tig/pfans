The only thing you'll gain out of better brake fluid is a reduction in
the amount of brake fade you'll experience.  Autocrossing doesn't tend to
accumulate heat in the brakes, since you're only on track for at most a
couple minutes at a time at relatively modest speeds, so I'd be very
suprised if brake fade were to become an issue for you.  I'd suggest
trying the stock fluid for now, and if you find that you're having fade
problems, switch to Ate Super Blue or the Ford heavy duty truck fluid.

Additionally, several people have told me that DOT5 fluids aren't
appropriate for my 911, for a number of reasons that I can't remember
now.  I seem to recall that you need to be certain you get absolutely
every little bit of old DOT3 fluid out of the system.  It may be that
this advice was based on my car being primarily a time trial/race car and
thus not appropriate to your situation, but since I can't remember
exactly, it may be relevant to your case as well.
