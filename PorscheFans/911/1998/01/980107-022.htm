Hey all,
Would anyone happen to have a trim piece for my 930?  It's the small
plastic "cap" that fits over the interior temp sensor, screwing into the
roof directly behind the windshield & in between the sun visors.

Now that somebody else has admitted to buying from Whitney, here's my $.02 on
what I bought. 
If you need sound insulation for your restoration project, check out their
"DynaMat" look insulation sheets (#12FX5514A). It's $24.99 for a sheet
(32x54"); enough to cover 1/2 a 911 floor or parts of 2 doors. Compare $$ with
what Automotion wants (albeit precut for doors). I also bought the Crane
pointless conversion kit for much less than what other suppliers are asking.
Here's one caveat:  I have not tested Whitney's customer service policies.
They will not refund money but will issue credit, and they seem to take their
time on deliveries.

Subject: '73 Carrera RS specs?

Hi,

There were a few Carrera RS owners who I corresponded with
on the old list, or other people may be able to answer these
questions.

I just got a '73 911 converted to RS specs
(2.7 RS MFI, fiberglass bumpers, roll cage, etc).
I want to run it in PCA E (touring) or D (Lightweight) 
club racing class. Right now the car's weight is
approximately half way between touring and lightweight.

1. Did the '73 RS come with only 6" and 7" by 15"
wheels or were 7" and 8" widths also available?
Any difference in wheel size lightweight vs touring?
1" wider than stock are legal and 9s are on the rear now.

2. What differences are there in a lightweight
other than door panels, glove box cover, carpeting,
rear seats, and thinner sheet metal?

3. Does anyone know how much lighter a plastic
type rear window is on a coupe? How about rear
quarter windows (I think these can be changed legally
in stock?).

4. Any other legal ways to lighten the rear of a '73 911
coupe?
