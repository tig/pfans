Hi Jim:

   Your 85 Carrera as well as the Euro version should have a 20mm front
bar and a 18mm rear one. You can update your car to the later Carrera
(86-on) swaybars which are 22mm front and 21mm rear.

This is a very inexpensive improvement since you can likely find a used
set of them. These sizes will help the understeer since the larger rear
bar will lessen the push at the front. This is a very balanced set-up
for a street car and is quite cost effective!

  Regarding the handling of your 911, most well-balanced cars will
understeer or push the front end in slow corners when the throttle is
opened :^)
To what degree this happens, depends upon many things including:

Throttle position
Tire pressures
Wheel & tire sizes
Use of a LSD
Road surfaces
Gear selection

To eliminate this "push" and make the car more neutral at lower speeds,
can create a very sensitive, twitchy 911 at speed that can spin with
little warning.
The factory has made some very good compromises here in the interest of
safety. Installing and using matched pairs of swaybars is good advice
for a  car driven mainly on the street.

These are tradeoffs that everyone makes when deciding how to upgrade
ther handling of their Porsche. You must decide what you are willing to
live with and how you intend to use your car, keeping in mind your
experience level.


Hope this helps..............
