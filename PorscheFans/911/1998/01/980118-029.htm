Sorry guys--just a humorous response based on distress, no, make that
panic, seen in many, many, many postings by CA drivers over smog testing.

I admit it, I purchased my 911 before doing as much research as I should have.
I bought a 76 targa with a bone stock (rebuilt at least) 2.7L motor. No chain
tensioner upgrade, has a 5 blade fan...etc...did have a pop off valve
though....

Here is my question or comment, depending on how you look at it:
I would like to know how many people out there actually have had a stud
problem with their 2.7L. What I am interested in are real stories. Not the
well I heard of a guy who had one and....   Well you know what I mean. The
stud problems that have occurred, are they failing while auto crossing or
racing, or are they failing when taking a pleasant, but fast, jaunt down the
favorite road?  What did the RSR have that the stock 2.7L everyday man motor
did not?  

If I am so transparent to say....are the 2.7L legends just that? Legends? Are
the stories largely inflated old tales?  Tell me, O' wise Porschefiles.
