I recently drove my car, shod with R1s, on a round trip of about 900
miles.  The R1s "held up fine".  This is really what they're intended
for (to be driven to/from the track).

My "local" track is about 2.5 hours away (mostly interstate @ 80+ mph).
I've done this a number of times on R1s.  No problem.

No experience on the S02s or PZeros, but R1s were a religious
experience compared to the Yoko AVS Intermediates and A008s I
used to run....

 The bushings are press fit, and then reamed to 8mm (I think, mic the
 hinge).  The top bushings are a bitch, unless you cut your ream down to
 avoid hitting the door sheet metal.

I do plan on taking the door off the car, hopfully that will help.
