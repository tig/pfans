Hi Pfans,
 To the person with the broken rear stabilizer bar bracket:
 I had the rear sway bar bracket break on my '89 Carrera.  Locating the part was 
very easy in the U.S. (don't believe any stories about paying someone to 
fabricate it for you) - call Stoddard's (800-342-1414). In Porsche's "Parts and 
Technical Reference Catalog" the part is called a "Stabilizer Bracket" and is 
part number 911.501.983.00, for model years 1974 thru 1989.  The clamp for the 
stabilizer bracket is part number 113.411.333 and is thoughtfully called a 
"Clamp" in their catalog. The stabilizer bushing part number varies depending on 
the model year, due to different stabilizer bar diameters used by Porsche.  If 
you want, e-mail me directly with your model year and stabilizer bar size (18mm, 
20mm, or 21mm) and I can look up the part number for you.  FWIW, the Porsche 
Parts and Technical Reference Catalog is invaluable for locating these bits and 
pieces and only costs US$9.95 for model years 1974-89.  Finally, I don't work 
for Stoddard's, but I am a very satisfied customer and have found them to be the 
one of the best stocked companies for Porsche parts.
			best regards,
			Jason Savage (jsavage@crystal.cirrus.com)
