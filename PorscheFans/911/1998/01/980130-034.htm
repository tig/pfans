The original message was:
I was wondering if anyone has replace the rear deck speakers on their
Carrera?  I have an 86 coupe and am wanting to replace the rear deck
speakers.  How do I get to them?  From inside the car or through the
engine compartment (do I just peel back the sound deadening material)?
*****From inside the car-the panel that forms the "rear deck" is also the
panel behind the rear seats.  Just fold down the rear seatbacks, and remove
a few Phillips screws, including the "straps" that hold the rear seatbacks
upright.  This entire panel just comes out very easily.

What are your thoughts on cutting the rear deck to make room for 6-1/2"
speakers?  Will this decrease resale value?
*****The space is very very limited underneath that panel, with just two
indentions in the metal below the speakers, and on the other side of the
metal-engine compartment.  (In other words-don't cut the metal!)  ;)There
are two ways that I know of to do this.  I recommend either simply "cutting
them loose" (disconnecting them), so that you only hear better quality front
speakers, either 5.25" 2 ways, or separate midrange/tweeter, like the
factory setup-with the tweeter mounted a bit higher in the door than the
midrange.  (If you don't already have such a factory setup in your car, you
can look at some other cars to see where to locate the tweeter.)  That 4 x
6" speaker location on the rear deck is pretty shallow.  On your car, it's a
little deeper than the SC's, but 2" really isn't much to "bottom mount" a
speaker.  A very thin 4x6" speaker will fit, but hardly an improvement over
factory, just a bit "cleaner", not a source for midrange or any upper bass.
"Top mounting" a plate speaker, or mounting any speaker on top of the panel
with or without a "spacer" to increase depth is going to require cutting of
that panel, usually leather.  I've done it, it's a bit scary at first,
realizing that it'll never be the same, but if you're committed to keeping
the upgraded speakers in the car and don't mind "altering" the interior in
this fashion, you shouldn't have a difficult time living with it.  It's
really hard to tell if a prospective buyer might have "problems" with such a
modification, I think it's unlikely unless you've got a "special" interior,
or the car has some "rare" status.  This "modification" certainly isn't
uncommon, with such a "challenging" original stereo layout.

Please feel free to write me for more details or our free catalog, which has
some tips for stereo systems in these cars.  Sorry if I rambled on too much,
I love talking about this stuff...
