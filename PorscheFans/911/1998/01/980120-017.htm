One data point from someone also in the SF/San Jose area (me) -- I settled on
an '87 coupe a little over a year ago.  The used 911 prices here are higher
than most other other areas in the US.  From your description of the car, I
would place the price of an outstanding condition '87 Targa with 87k miles at
around $24-$25k direct from the previous owner (wholesale), with dealer's
starting price (retail) 10-15% higher.  This would be near perfect condition,
full service records, and obviously cared for extremely well throughout its
life.

If a dealer, or someone equivalent who bought the car from a seller and now has
to make some profit, is offering the car for under $25k, I would say it is
either a pretty good deal or there is something possibly wrong with it.  I
wouldn't worry but no matter what, have it *thoroughly* checked by a Porsche
specialist independent of the dealer and the car's previous history, and picked
by yourself.  For service I would personally recommend either CT Automotive in
Campbell or Heyer Performance in Mountain View, if you live in the Silicon
Valley area.  I personally place a high importance on meeting the previous
owner to assess their knowledge and care for the car, and full service records.

Good luck!
