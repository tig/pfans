Keith, I don't know about 911's but I did try this while attempting to
speed shift with my Dad's new 1960 Chevrolet Impala convertable with the
348 cu. inch engine.

It can be done (at least up to 35 mph) and yes, the tire smoke is quite
impressive. What is less impressive is seeing the high school girls (OK,
it was my junior year in high school) doubled over in hysterical
laughter.
-----------------------------------
On a more serious note, has anybody had problems with a Bursch sport
muffler breaking the mounting point breaking? The result was that the
muffler was supported by the Catalytic Converter, further resulting in
the Converter tubing (exterior) breaking. It has been on the 911 for 2
1/2 years. 

Luckily, Express Muffler in San Diego was able to reweld the mounting
points (at a very reasonable price, I might add). I'd like to know if
this is an isolated instance or a (mounting) design flaw.
