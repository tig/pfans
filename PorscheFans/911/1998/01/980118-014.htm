Hello All,
    I have another question. I have had the oil bypass mod done to my
case, and purchased the upgrade kit.
    In my old kit both springs were of the same length, which made it
easy. In the new kit, the springs are different. One is 3.45", and the
other is 2.75". There is also a brass guide which comes with the kit
which I will assume goes on the longer spring.
    I measured the depth of both the side and bottom port and found that
there is a slight depth difference. The side port measured 2.15",. and
the bottom was 2.45". I am assuming that the longer spring and guide
would therefore go into the bottom port.

    Can anyone confirm this? Why is it always the little things that
cause the most grief?

Thanks for the help.
Eric
