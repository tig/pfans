With all the recent discussion on race tires vs. street tires lately, and
specifically the BFG T/A R1 tire, I thought a bit of a heads up might
benefit fellow P'Fans. The most recent Team T/A newsletter announced that a
new R1 will be out soon, called the "g-Force T/A R1." A photo of the tire
was published and it looks substantially different from the current
generation R1. Although the article didn't provide a lot of specifics, it
did say that the g-Force R1 tread will be molded at facing depth,  3/32 of
an inch, thereby eliminating the need for tread shaving. It also stated that
the tire will initially be available in sixteen different 14-, 15- and
17-inch sizes. The article states that both the g-Force and current R1 will
be produced for a time during the transition period to the new tire. If
history is a guide, you'll probably be able to buy the current R1 a lot
cheaper once g-Force production ramps up to full capacity and the current R1
is discontinued.

I've been running R1s for years on my '65 Shelby--and recently on my '87
Carrera--and have allways been a big R1 fan.  R1s  are entirely streetable
and exhibits good wear characteristics, considering their race-oriented
design. It looks as though the g-Force tire will be less streetable,
particularly in the wet,  because of its shallower tread depth. In any case,
I can't wait try them out.
