Thanks to those who replied to my request for suggestions on which tail 
to consider.  I still haven't heard from anyone about using the lid and 
tail from a C2.  If Steve Norsworthy reads this, maybe you can help.  I 
see you have what I might need.  Will probably call you this weekend.  
I've checked with my mechanic and he seems sure it will work but has 
never installed one.  There were a couple comments about the 78 SC being 
a narrow body.  I've never thought of the car as a narrow body.  The 
only cars that I've seen wider are the turbos.  Can someone shed some 
light on this comment.  Anyways, if the C2 doesn't work, everyone 
(myself included) who likes the Carrera tail will be happy to know that 
your votes won out.  Thanks again.
