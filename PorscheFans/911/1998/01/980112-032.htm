Unless you have an extremely rare and hitherto unknown factory light
weight racing emergency brake handle, the one thing you can't do is
anodize it.  I have never heard anodizing mentioned except in connection
with aluminum, and have seen descriptions (details forgotten) on how it
is done on aluminum - how it can harden the surface, how color can be
added, etc.  So I'd scratch that one off the list.

I had engine sheet metal powder coated once, and it stuck as well as or
better than factory baked paint.  Of course, it is pretty easy to get these
parts to the powder coater.  I knew some sort of electrostatic process
was used to get the paint to want to go sit on and bond to the metal, but
didn't realize heat was involved also until I got back my windshield wiper
arms with melted plastic end caps.  So be sure you don't have anything
other than metal in what you have powder coated.  So you can't use it
on your banana arms (unless you take out the grease filled bearings,
etc) or A arms (unless you remove the rubber bushings).  With that
caveat, it would be my first choice for painting functional parts some sort
of semi gloss black.

Otherwise, you might try Zynolite spray can epoxy paint from the
hardware store.  The estimable Carroll Smith said good things about it in
one of his "how to" car books (and he doesn't say good things about
much) so I tried it.   I don't know how you can make a one part spray
catalyze, but it does seem to make a pretty tough paint.  I used this on my
race car's A arms and crossmember and spring plates, and it has held
up pretty well, considering the blasting some of this gets.  Better,
anyway, than lacquer spray paints. 

Weren't the spring plates cadmium plated originally?  The sort of
yellow-gold color?  This is getting into concours terrain, not my forte.  It
looks to me like cadmium plating exposed to the weather is gone (or at
least fading) after ten years or so, so doubtless your 25 year old car
shows no signs of it (if it was used).  But my concours buddies are
always talking to taking parts to the plater, so you can get stuff replated
with cadmium.
