Bob,
 If the normal heater blower on (top of the engine)
is the only blower "on" for normal heat, the heater
system would be slightly pressurized. 
 If the defroster blower is up front somewhere, it
would umm "suck" on the heater system, i.e. create
a slight vacuum if the heater blower couldn't keep up.
 Sooo, maybe the defroster blower is sucking oily fumes
in through a leak in the heater system. Perhaps one of the
old heater duct hoses has crack in it.
