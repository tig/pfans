I tired them a year or two ago.  The "kit" consisted of two triangular
plastic pieces and no instructions.  The plastic was extremely thin and
brittle.  Without instructions, I broke one of them trying to figure out
how to install them.  Maybe it was me, but I finally gave up on the
second one.  That's my $0.02, and its also what I thought those plastic
parts were worth.
