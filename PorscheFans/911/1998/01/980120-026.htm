I have a 1971 911T and had a strange experience I hope someone can help me 
figure out.

I drove it to work the other day, even drove it for some shopping during 
lunch.
When it was time to go home I started it up.  It ran a little rough like one 
cylinder was not firing.
Hoping it would smooth out as I drove I started home.  Looking in the 
rear-view mirror I was surprised to see a smokescreen a mile long.
We're talking James Bond style here.  I turned around and drove back to my 
parking space.  Most embarrasing.
After idling for about a minute it suddenly smoothed out and the smoke was 
gone.

Shrugging my shoulders, I drove it home without a hitch.  It was fine over the 
weekend.

Any ideas to what happened?
