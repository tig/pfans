Brad,
The sender unit is on top of the engine, well forward of just about
everything and should have two wires going to it: Green/red which is for
the gauge and green/white which goes to central informer(idiot light). 
I'm not sure, but it looks like power comes through the gauge to the
sender which varies resistence to ground. This would suggest the reading
to ground from the sender would be infinite for your car's failure mode.
Make sure you disconnect the wiring first. ;^) Better yet, if your not
familiar with electronics, take it to someone who is.  Shorting
something else to ground on our cars could be VERY expensive! Good Luck.

Does anyone know if there is a way to re-paint the front lenses the factory
amber coating color?  I have lenses that are in great shape, just faded from
the years.  Thanks for the help.
