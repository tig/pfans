I own a 1987 911 Targa.  I have owed many stick shift cars before but
none which beg to be driven like this one.  I have a few questions which
I would appreciate someone answering.  They will probably seem simple
but I don't know the answer.
1.  On a 3.2 Carerra engine, what is the maximum safe RPM you can go to
before dropping the clutch.
2.  When I say "drop" the clutch, I assume that you rev the engine to a
safe level and just yank your foot off of the clutch.  Am I right to
assume that?
3.  When you "drop" the clutch, should you start to give it even more
gas than the RPMs you use to get started or should I let the clutch
engage before giving it more gas?
	I do not want to tear up my engine or my clutch but would like to get
the most fun out of car.  Thanks for any help you can give me.  If there
is a place on the net which explains what I am asking for, please
advise.  Also, has anyone tried the mass flow sensor advertised by
Performance Products?
