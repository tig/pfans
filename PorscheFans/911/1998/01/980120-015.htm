I have some questions about removal and re-installation of my windshield.
I'm doing this because I need to replace my dash.  I have an 83 911SC.
I'm going to state everything the Haynes manual says on the procedure with
questions.

1: Fold the wipers forward, "then cut away the rubber seal from outside
the bezel."

Is the bezel the metal trim ?  Should I just dig a knife into rubber
around the outside of the metal trim ?  That's enough to get the
windshield out ?

2: "Carefully prize away the bezel then cut through the rubber seal
parallel to the windscreen ?"

I thought the metal trim should be removed after the entire assembly was
removed.  This sounds like it's saying to remove the metal trim first.

3: Remove windshield.

4: Scrape away remaining seal or sealant.  Fix any rust spots.

5: Get new moulding and smear a little soap and water solution into the
bezel groove.

Install the bezel so that there is approx. 0.4 in (1mm) gap at the top and
bottom in the middle.

??  Shouldn't I put the rubber on the window before inserting the metal
trim ?

6:  Place the moulding on the windscreen, and draw a piece of strong cord
into the moulding at the top so that the cord overlaps by about 12in
(30cm) in the top moulding.

??  I think I see what this does.  It is used to pull the inside of the
rubber seal around the sealing lip.  Mitchell Fieg posted a while back
that width of the string is important.  Why ?  Where should the ends of
the string end up before I start pulling ?

7:  Put glycerine on sealing lip and insert windshield at bottom.

8:  Slowly pull out cord so rubber lip is drawn over sealing lip of body.

9:  Slide center clips over metal trim.

10: Carefully prise the seal away from the metal, then from the glass,
then inject a mastic-type sealing compound.  Ensure that the bezel is kept
at an even distance from the windscreen aperture.

?? What is this all about ?  I don't get this at all.

Thanks for any advice.

Chris Cope
