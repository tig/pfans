Hi:

    This is our first time post to the 911 list (though we've been
lurking for a while).  About six months ago we purchased a beautiful
1985 911 Carrera, and it remains a constant joy to drive (it's in fact a
daily driver).  We have a question about the fill line of the brake
fluid reservoir--the manual says to fill it to the "mark", but try as we
might we can't find one.  The only delineation we see is the join where
the top portion of the reservoir meets the body, which seems to be right
at the top of the reservoir (the fill cap is recessed into the top
portion).  In the absence of any other mark, is this the point to which
the reservoir should be filled, i.e., almost but not quite to the full
fluid capacity?

    Also (and if this has been asked a million times before don't kill
us, but there doesn't appear to be a means of searching the Archives),
has anyone discovered a good way to mount a (blush) cup-holder?  We've
tried about everything except the type that screws into the door and
flips down, but nothing seems to work reliably--hot tea is NOT what we
want in our laps when taking a hard corner!  Any advice would be
appreciated.

Thanks, Mark Mills/Rosalind Westlake
