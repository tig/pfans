Bruce,
    Thanks for the confirmation.  I did not think I saw any washers when Jerry
dissassembled Rich's '72 for the class, but never hurts to make sure.
    Copied the list so this might benefit others.

At trackside products we sell a lot more Yokohama AO32's for the street and
street/track combination than the BFG R1's. Even though the R1's do well in
the rain and are legal, the AO32 just looks more like a street tire. 

Having spent a good 30 minutes early one Saturday morning explaining over AND
OVER again to some rookie cop that my R1's WEREN"T slicks or bald, I can
understand some peoples reluctance to running them on the street.

I finally gave this cop my business card, told him I owned a shop and sold
these tires every day AND invited him to come down and read the literature I
had on hand..... AND after he'd tried to figure out any other way he could to
give me a ticket...... and finally he sent me off with the verbal backstep
that "we're not here to give citizens a hard time. We're just interested in
safety...."
