>>I need some advice on torsion bars size for my 930 Ruf BTR 82. Current

Patrick,
Let me say first that I am very surprised that Ruf would put such a small
set of torsion bars (18/26) on one of their BTR's with the kind of HP you
are generating. Must have been a "comfort group" option.
That said, and having read many many times if people on this thread and
other places who want to upgrade their torsion bars for performance, but
don't want to "stiffen" up the car to much, these are mutually exclusive.
The edict is, bigger torsion bars produce a stiffer ride.
We have experimented with many bars on 930 and late 911's (cars weighing
3,000 lbs or so) and come to the conclusion that the difference in stiffness
(and ride)between the 22/28 combination and the 23/30 combination is almost
unnoticeable. The difference in handling between these two setups is fairly
significant with the when set up with proper shocks (we use Bilstien sport)
and adjustable sway bars. The 23/30 combination produces a much better
handling car on the track and off  Another advantage with the larger rear
bars in a high HP, relatively heavy turbo is that it helps to prevent rear
end squat when the turbo kicks in. In fact on the higher HP turbos, we are
now using 31 on the rear.
Good luck with your project.

Terry
