After a recent massive downpour, during which my '86 Cab
sat outside without protection, it refused to start.

There was no real eveidence of moisture in the engine
compartment, around the distributor etc. But, the
car gave little evidence of any spark and/or fuel
whatsoever.

Attempts to start continued for an hour or so. At one
point, it did run poorly for 10 seconds. Then died,
and acted as before.

Totally frustrated, a left it alone for about 90 minutes. 
Then, it fired right up and ran as a good little 911 should.

I'm puzzled as to why it didn't start in the first place.
Any ideas? This only happens if the car has been stading still
in the rain. It'll drive all day in this weather without a
problem.

Thanks,

Jim Bauman
