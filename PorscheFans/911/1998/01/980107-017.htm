Pfans,
Can someone explain if there is a possibility of an intermittent failure on
the part of the Carrera tensioners?  I have an '84 Carrera with 145k
miles.  Runs perfectly...no odd noises until one night last week.  After the
car set for a couple of hours, on start up a loud noise coming from right
rear side of the engine.  It was not the AC compressor, fan or alternator. 
Sounded like what I imagine a rotating slack chain would sound like. 
Noise varied greatly with RPM, fading out (or masked) above 2k.  After 5
minutes of very gentle driving it disappeared completely and has not
reappeared.  Oil pressure was normal during entire episode.  Could this
be a failing tensioner?  Should I open and inspect immediately, and if so,
what specifically should I check for?  Appreciate any assistance as I'm
pretty nervous with my daily driver potentially having heart disease.  TIA.
