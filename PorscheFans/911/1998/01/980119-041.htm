Hi Pfans,

I was wondering how I would go about strengthening my 73 Targa Chassis.  The
car has apparently had the floors replaced by one of the P.O. that owned the
car before I did.  ( I was ripped off when I bought it but liked it too much
to get rid of it).  The car seems pretty solid but I was told by my mechanic
that I shouldn't take the car to the track until I look after the chassis.

Anyone out there know the weak points or areas of concern in this car?  I'm
itching to get the car ready for some fun at the track this spring/summer
and would appreciate any help.

I was also wondering if anyone from the Toronto area would be able to
reccomend a good body shop to do a strip down and repaint on the vehicle.

Thanks again
