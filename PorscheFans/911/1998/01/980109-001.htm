Re Nathan Fornwalt's question about painting spoked Fuchs wheels, the
suggestion of dipping would be the most authentic--if you look at the
back of the wheel it looks like this is exactly what the factory did.  

However, if you want to spray the wheels while they're on the car, 3m
makes a fine line tape which you can use to create the edge, then fill
out the rim and spokes with ordinary masking tape and paper; then spray
satin black. 

A paint store that sells automotive finishes ought to have this tape.  I
did the job a few years ago and the edges came out fine.  However, these
wheels have spent a good deal of the time off the car, so I can't vouch
for durability.  But whether you dip or spray it's still paint--prone to
chipping, which anodizing is not.
