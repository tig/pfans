Tom Manson asks:
What does a crankfire ignition consist of?
Is there a crank position sensor either at the flywheel or the pulley?
Is there a cam position sensor?
Can you alter the advance curve?
Who makes such a system?
How much do they cost?
Are they also capable of controlling the fuel injection?

kind of all of the above.  Starting with the Motronics in '84 Porsche uses
a sensor on the flywheel to figure out crank position.  I think this is used
to fire the ignition, although a distributor still distributes the spark, as well
as control the fuel injectors.  Maybe the distributor gives a signal to tell
where generally in the 720 degree crank cycle the crank is?

Electromotive is the aftermarket crankfire system I am familiar with, and it
is about 10 years old.  three "coils" mounted on a plate with brains
inclosed fire two plugs each, and a sensor on the crank pulley tells crank
angle.  For a twin plug setup you buy two of these, which is what I have
in my race car with carbs.  If one of the spark modules ever goes bad
(mine never have) you can get replacements at any good parts store, as
they are used on some sort of US car.  

Electromotive also makes a version with a complete brain inclosed for
fuel injection, and I suspect the market for used spark only versions is a
buyer's market now, as racers upgrade to electronic fuel injection (my
goal too, but always been too expensive and the carbs do work).

I think the Electromotive crankfires are great.  Mine have been basically
flawless (which I think are maybe 10 years old now, and I got 5 years
ago used).  Zero maintenance, and no bouncing, jittering, fluttering of
spark timing.  Set it and forget it.  Timing adjustment is pretty crude (initial
set with the sensor position and also a pot, 1000-3000 pot, 3000-8000
pot, and a rev limiter pot) and linear in the non brain version.  Plus a
connection to add a fixed extra retard (maybe when on boost in a
turbo?), and another to add a fixed advance for some other purpose (I've
never used either).   However, 911s don't seem to be all that sensitive in
racing applications to fine advance control.  Street use might be different
for max fuel economy and minimum emissions.  I don't know if the brain
version (programmable) has more "points" for advance (though it
probably does, as this is not a big deal with programming). 

On 911s the cam position is locked to the crank position, and with the
waste spark system (the plug you need to fire fires, and also its opposite
which is at TDC on its exhaust stroke fires when there is nothing to
burn) it doesn't matter whether the crank is at #1 firing position TDC or
180 cam degrees later (somehow the fuel injection versions figure this
out, though, as they must, maybe using a sawed off distributor
attachment).  

The new 996 water cooled engine is advertised as having the
vario cam system the 968s have, but who'se going to be hotrodding one
of those any time soon?  At close to 300 HP out of a 3.4 with 11:1 CR or
whatever it won't be easy to get more HP in your back yard under a
shade tree.

Electromotive advertises.  They may also be on the internet.  They are in
NJ, 703-378-2444.  Also, some of the TWR injection distributors (see ad
in Pano) use Electromotive to go with their mechanicals.  Racer
Wholesale advertises Electromotive units at $390 for a 6 cylinder spark
only unit (single plug), which is about half what it cost 10 years ago.  If
the various competition rules for stock or almost stock cars allowed it
(none do as far as I can see), I'd put one on my SC street/track car, at
least I would if ever the Bosch CD gave out or the distributor wore out.

I think that Haltech and Motec and the high end racing electronic engine
management programmable systems also provide spark management.

For constructing your own digital distributorless ignition system, see: 
http://spbted.gtri.gatech.edu/hpe/ddis.html.  This is not for the
electronically faint of heart.  A circuit daigram and other information for
one of the other FI/spark systems can be found on a web site - can't
remember if Motec or the one which starts with Z.
