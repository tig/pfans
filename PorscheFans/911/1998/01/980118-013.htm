William,

The fuel line I'm talking about is the line from the top of the fuel
filter, going under the air intake manifolds, rear towards the
alternator, then branching to each side to feed the fuel injector
rails.  The part consists of a 12" rubber line from the fuel filter into
an L-shaped brass tube running under the air intake and above the engine
case.  Just forward of the alternator, the brass is branched into a
T-section.  Each side then has about an 8" section of rubber line which
connect into each cylinder bank fuel rails.  The rubber sections dry out
and crack.

The Porsche Part Number:  930.110.595.05

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
'87 911 Targa  (w/VERY degraded fuel line)

can someone tell me which line is being discuss here?  And does anyone
have the new part number?

TIA

I realize this may be an easy one, but I need some help.  I was testing the
compression on a recently purchased 88 Cab.  I was able to get to plugs 1-5,
but the position of #6 (far right) is really awkward.  Is there some trick to
getting to this last plug?

Do you have to remove the oil line to the rear hood.  It looks like that may
ease access.  If you do remove the line, do you apply a sealant when it is re-
attached.  Thanks.

Hi,

>> I'm in the process of converting my '72 2.4 T into a hot rod street car.
Modifications include lager pistons, higher compression, webers, racing
headers and slightly modified heads. I'm a bit foggy as to which cam
profile to run. The car will basically be a street car with occasional
drivers ed's . Basically will I have more fun with a well balanced 911 E 
or solex cam or do I want to run a moderate race cam and sacrifice some
low end grunt? I was praying that somebody could share there experiences
and point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance for any help you
may have to offer. <<

I agree with Steve and Andy that S cams are the way to go,
with other S mods too (heads, stacks, etc). Even with a 2.4
the S cams feel so good when you hit the power band!
There are aftermarket S type cams available that may
be even better (GE made some).
