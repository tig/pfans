Hi Porschephiles,

        I have a 1988 Carrera Targa with the stock 15" Fuchs not the
optional 16" Fuchs, but the wheels are wider than standard; Fronts 15x7 with
195/65VR and Rears 15x8 with 215/60VR B.F. Goodrich Comp T/A's.  It's time
to change the fronts as I believe they are out of round as the ride is a
little shakey above 50mph.  I've balanced and aligned all 4 wheels and the
shakeness still persists.  I've even repacked the front wheel bearings.
Does any one know what was the original brand of tire in that year?  Some
porschephiles say that they were Dunlop DM's and other say they were Yoko
A008P's.  As these tire sizes are diminishing in availability, I would like
to purchase a set of four and maintain the stock feature of the car.  Since
Yoko A008P are available in the Z rating in those sizes, I wouldn't mind
picking up those as the sidewalls are stiffer enabling less "roll under"
during hard corning, but I've heard the technology is old and maybe the Yoko
AVS Intermediate or AVS S4 are better.  I am looking for a tire that is
great in the rain since it rains 6 months out of the year in the Pacific
Northwest.  Has anyone experience either the Dunlop DM4's or Yoko A008P on
there Carreras, which one is better overall in dry and wet road conditions?

Thanx Rick
