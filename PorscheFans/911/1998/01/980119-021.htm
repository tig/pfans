Skip wants to know:

>We're stripping weight off our 911T/RS spec racer. Does anyone have
suggestions on easy ways to remove the sound deadening material on the pan?
***************************
There's no easy way, but one that works is to use a heat gun and a putty
knife/scraper. The heat softens the stuff enough that the scraper can get
it off. Once the bulk of it is off, you can use a drill or grinder-mounted
wire wheel to clean up the surface.

BTW, you'll find that there's nothing under the undercoating. On the early
911s, the factory shot the undercoat over bare metal.  Hit it with a wash
of solvent/degreaser to clean up the final undercoat residue, then a rust
deactivator, anti-rust primer and a finish coat of paint to keep the water
out.

Were I in your shoes, I would resist the temptation to try a chemical
stripper. Most have to be scraped off anyway, and you add toxic fumes to
your list of other problems. Chemical strippers also have a tendency to get
inside joints, like rocker panel boxes, chassis seams, etc., and not get
out. The active stripper then seeeeeeppppppppssssss slowly out and eats
whatever paint you've put over it. For a race car, this may not be all that
awful, since you'll be repainting dents and dings over time.

Enjoy your project......
