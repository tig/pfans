Hi Peter,
 I had the same problem on my '89 Carrera about 8 months ago, so here is what I 
remember:

1. Disconnect battery ground.
2. Remove horn pad by pulling it straight back.  I think there is also a brown 
ground wire that also needs to be disconnected when the horn pad is off.
3. Remove the steering wheel nut using a 27mm socket (available from Sears). You 
will also need an extension on your ratchet in order to get to the nut.
4. Pull the wheel off after marking its relative position on the column.
5. You will now see a few set screws on the inside of the column, that hold the 
plastic clam shell into place.  That is why the clam shell does not come off 
when you take out the set screws that are on the outside of the steering wheel 
column.
6. With the plastic calm shell off, you can see the reeds. They are on the same 
side of the steering wheel as the lever that actuates the high beams.  By 
playing with the high beam lever, you will quickly see which 2 reeds are shorted 
together. Use a needle nose pliers to bend the errant reed at its base until it 
is no longer permanently shorted into high beam mode.  You can reconnect the 
battery while the steering wheel is still off to see if you got everything 
right.  
7. Disconnect the battery after your experiments, and installation is the 
reverse of above.

			good luck,
			Jason Savage
