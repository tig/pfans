At the factory last August I asked about cupholders, got the condescending
"it's not very smart to drink a beverage behind the wheel."  Couldn't help
but notice, however, that Porsches still come equipped with an ashtray and a
cigarette lighter.  By this I surmise that lighting up behind the wheel is
considered a more enlightened activity, at least by those 'in the know'...
<g>

Anyway, the same day I found and bought some nifty Porsche cupholders in the
factory 'boutique' that clip snugly onto the wall of the door storage
compartment.  They require no permanent mounting, and they work pretty well,
except that you have to lift your coffee out before closing the door (or it
will splatter all over the cockpit).  I noticed that my local dealer has
started carrying them, although he seems to be perpetually out of stock.
