Pfans,

To all,
Thanks for responding to my CC problem....although it's more of an
annoyance than a real problem.  Every few minutes a quick bump up on
the stalk brings the speed back up, but the surging is starting to bother
me.  I have gotten several responses that point to:
(1)  The control unit.  Several responses have said "similar problems,
replaced unit, problem fixed."
(2) Vacuum leaks.  I've checked pretty carefully and don't believe I have
any, but you know how that goes...
(3)  One response mentioned a sticking throttle linkage....mine seem
perfectly smooth.  
So the net result of my efforts seem to point at simply (but $$) replacing
the unit.  Several sources were provided for rebuilt units at approx $150,
email me directly for these.  Thanks again to the list!
