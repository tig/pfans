You might try Dulles International Motorsports out by Dulles airport.  I =
had them do some suspension work for me last year, (lowered with Eibach =
springs, cross balance, align) and I was very happy with the work.  They =
did the alignment as part of the other work, so it is hard to say what =
the price would have been for that alone.  Other quotes I got were =
around $200 for cross balancing and alignment.  Dave Herman is the =
service manager there 703-471-4111.

I get my tires at Radial Tire in Bethesda.  They carry about everything, =
and their pricing is competitive with Tire Rack's mail order prices.  =
They do a lot of work on expensive cars and are very careful.  The owner =
is a member of PCA as well.

I have no personal interest in either of these companies, just like to =
recommend good shops when I find them.
