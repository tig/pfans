Any and all advice/opinions are appreciated on the subject of welding for auto 
and home:

I'm toying with the idea of getting a MIG Welder for auto and general home use 
Seems like a real good idea to be able to do this kind of task my self.  
Especially for those small jobs.  Does anyone have any experience with same?  
I'd like to be able to work with sheet metal and aluminum around the house and 
garage (110v preferred but 220V would also be OK but I'd have to run a 220 
line to the garage....hey then I could finally convert my air compressor).

Auto sheet metal is generally 1/8-3/16" thick right?

What's the learning curve?

What features should I get?  Amperage, duty cycle, spot/stitch timer?

Is MIG the way to go, or Arc welding.  I've seen MIG welders for $400-600 the 
the Sears Auto Shop catalog.  They also have a "Mity Mite" arc welder with for 
$120 that has 10% duty cycle at 70amps.  I know wht duty cycle means but dont 
know how long it takes to weld, for example,  a 1 foot bead.

Thanks for reading this message.  I look forward to your suggestions....
Joe Thompson
