well...  not trying to be a downer or anything, but i've yet to see fiber
stick well to steel.
i've stuck fiber flares to my 914 twice now (with premium epoxy).   things
look fine until you have to deal with temperature extremes, then they crack
at the steel/fiber border. if you don't mind re doing it every two years,
cool, otherwise you may be disappointed.

i did not use a flange, but feathered the junction.  i used self tapping
sheet metal screws to hold things together until the epoxy set, then pulled
the screws, feathered the edge, overlapped everything with fiberglass soaked
in epoxy, and feathered again when set, then a quick skim coat of wurth
filler (it's super magic stuff), sanded, prepped and painted.

if anyone has other ideas on a better way, i'd love to hear it, but since i
have a mig now (as well as *lots* of practice) i expect my next project will
involve steel.

speaking of my next project, i'm interested as well in what experiences
people have had with supercharged 911 engines.  i'm 6'4" and have trouble
fitting in my 914 with a roof/rollcage/helmet, so i'm thinking 72/73 911
with a 3.0 or 3.2 with a blower.  somehow 2400 pounds with 300 - 400 hp
seems so entertaining.
