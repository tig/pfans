I would like some comments or suggestions on adding a tail to my car.  I 
know that the Carrera tail would be more inline with an SC as opposed to 
the turbo tail.  I also expect that whatever I add will be OEM.  The car 
has chin a spoiler.  I was told knowing what's upfront is important when 
trying to obtain proper balance. I have also been kicking around the 
idea of a C-2 tail.  I like the style of the 911 with its sloping lines 
and having a tail that is only visible at speed appeals to me.  Does 
anyone know if this type of tail can be added and made functional on a 
SC?  Are the deck lids interchangable?  It should also be noted that the 
car is air-conditioned, although I'm thinking about eliminating that 
option.  The only time I use the air is to make sure the system is 
charged and the seals are lubricated.  Looking forward to all your 
suggestions.
