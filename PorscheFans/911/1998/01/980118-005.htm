Moe:


Just a note to let you know that I did get the Pertronix unit from GPR installed, and it's working great!  In my 911 the fuel pump had been moved up to the front of the car, so connecting the + lead of the Pertronix unit to the power for the fuel pump (as recommended by GPR) wan't that practical.  I ended up using a positive lead at the CD box instead.  Black wire is connected to the wire that the points were previously connected to inside the distributor.  

I also broke down and put in a new distribitor, since mine was pretty beat. The motor is now very "smooth running" with the "rock solid tach" mentioned by Neil!  Makes the car seem 10 years newer.  

Good luck with yours!
