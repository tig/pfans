Hi Porsche Fans,

    Could someone tell me the correct method to remove the movable rear
wing on a 97 993 C2. I'm going to install an aftermarket 3.8 GT type
wing and split front spoilers, plus have the car lowered. My local
Porsche mechanic, Frank Eibell (very knowledgeable and highly
recommended) will be doing the lowering, but I'm going to try and
install the 3.8 wing and the front spoilers myself. I guess I could ask
him, but if I already know how maybe he'll think I know something! The
3.8 wing fits in the area left by the movable wing using the original
rear lid. Also, if someone could let me know how to change the front
split spoilers on the 993 I would greatly appreciate it.

    These cars are really fun and true masterpieces of engineering. It's
a shame the air-cooled boxer engine must die and give way to the new
liquid cooled boxer, but I do understand the reasoning--don't
necessarily agree but understand. I plan on holding onto my air-cooled
for a very long time.

Thanks for your help and consideration,

Mike Wyatt
