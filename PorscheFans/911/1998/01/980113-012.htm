Yesterday, I posted a request for suggestions about putting on a PCA
driving school for teenagers. Every reponse has come back saying
insurance won't permit it. I realize that insurance may kill the
program, but I would like to try. 

Before I go for insurance, I would like to have a well thought out
program. As I wrote yesterday, 
>My initial thoughts are to have it a one day event. I would include a
>skid pad; accident avoidance (3 choice at end of a strait, swerve left,
>right or hard braking with a flagman who indicates which way the student
>must go); braking exercise; perhaps a increasing/decreasing radius
>curves on a small oval, etc. We should be able to get the California
>Highway Patrol to come out and give an hour talk on Drunk Driving and
>their views of traffic safety (i.e., the Fear of God talk).

Please give me your thoughts on what the class should include (types of
maneuvers, topics for lectures before driving starts, types of
instructors, etc). 

I will post the summary of all suggestions when I am finished. Again I
realize that the class MAY die because of impossibility of insurance,
but unless I ask--with a well thought out, safe program--it won't occur
at all.
