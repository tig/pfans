Hello All, 
A couple of questions for you today.  

I just got my car back from my wrench (he did some minor interior work)
and he mentioned that I should get a tune-up every 15k miles.  I've had
my car for about 16k miles now and was just getting ready to change the
oil.  Is this recommendation accurate?  He mentioned the oil (and other
fluids would be changed), valve adj, and basically a general going over
- price $600.  Can anyone confirm/deny this info.  I feel pretty
comfortable with my wrench up to this point, but I figured it wouldn't
hurt to ask you.

Apparently I need to replace my front tires.  They were purchased by the
previous owner and now have about 25k on them - they are Yoko AVS S-4z.
When I replaced the rear tires a few months back, apparently the factory
was sold out of the AVS S-4, so I went with a Yoko S306(not a very well
known tire, I know, but the "tire guy" said they were the most similar
Yoko).  In any case, I don't want to go with Yoko's again, and I don't
want to spend a fortune on tires.  My car is an every day driver, but I
do plan on participating in more autocrosses this season (only got in
two last year), so I guess I'm really looking for a middle-of-the-road
tire.  Any suggestions?

Last topic(for now) is my clock seems to be running slow(just started
w/in the past day or two).  Any troubleshooting suggestions, or do I
need to replace it.  How hard is it to replace it?  Also, it seems that
my fuel & druck gauges are getting condensation on the insides of them,
is there a way to open them up, or do I need to replace them too?

Your help is greatly appreciated.
