Rick:

My 87 had the Dunlops.  They were shitty tires and always 'thumped' when cold.
I don't believe the Yok 008P's came on the scene until later, maybe 1991 or so
and, as I remember, Yok was an approved tire/OEM tire on Porsche only for a
few years in the 90's, mainly in the 911 turbos.  Porsche typically had 2 or 3
tire suppliers and my current '88 (original owner) 944ts came with German
Goodyears.

I have a set of 008Ps on a BMW and they are very fine tires, but again, early
90's technology.
