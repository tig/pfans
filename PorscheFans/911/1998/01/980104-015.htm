The cabin of this fine car is not a lunchroom; nor is it a cafeteria. 
Consider stopping at a coffee shop.

Mark & Rosalind:

There are a number of cupholders available through the aftermarket...
The only ones that seem to work need to be permanently mounted with
screws.

Instead of buying a cupholder, you might be able to get by with a
better cup.  Your local Starbucks Coffee shop and buy one of their
travel mugs... They come in a number of styles and sizes, and all
have a "spill-proof" lid.

The lid isn't REALLY spill-proof -- if you turn the cup upside down,
it WILL leak -- but hot tea certainly won't slosh out of the cup
during hard cornering, so you may feel comfortable holding the cup
in your lap or wedging it next to the seat.

If you want a really low-cost cupholder that'll stay put and hold
nearly any size cup, you can do what my wife does in the NSX (which
has the world's WORST cupholders):  Wedge the toe of a high-top
aerobics shoe under the front edge of the passenger seat, then put
your drink in the shoe.
