Following is a rather long list of 911 parts accumulated over the last
several years (20-year PCA member).   Parts are personally owned.  I have
read in previous postings on this list that For Sale lists of this type were
wanted (as opposed to not wanted).  However, if in general, the readership
doesn't want to see an occasional list of this length, please reply to the
list so that I and others will know.

Note that there are some rare early engine/clutch parts which may be of
interest to vintage racing enthusiasts.
