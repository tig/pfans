    Dunno, Larry... I'm a 914 guy, and I know very little about the
    various options for late-model 911s.

    Metal-to-metal contact is usually avoided through the use of
    "rubber" bump-stops on the shocks.  You still feel a shock when
    the car bottoms out on the bump-stops, but it's not as bad as if
    they wren't installed.

    You could, but -- as I've been discussing in private email with
    another list-member -- you probably don't want to do that if you
    can avoid it, since you'll be limiting suspension droop travel.
