Parts suppliers often advertise "aluminum pressure plates" and "cast iron
pressure plates" for 911s which used the 915 transmission (1972
through 1986).  Some list members, including me, have wondered what
is involved here, and have been confused.  I did a little checking at
Carquip, a used Porsche parts place conveniently located, and
discovered there are actually three types of pressure plate, all of which
fit any of the flywheels used on the 72-86 engines.

For discussion, let us say the pressure plate assembly consists of three
parts (it actually has more, of course):  

a spring (a steel plate cut into fingers which converge in a hole in the
middle where the throwout bearing resides, and which when pulled
releases the pressure on the clutch disk and thus disconnects the
engine from the transmission, and when left alone causes the disk to be
pressed into the flywheel, thus connecting engine and transmission). 
The spring is pretty much the same on all flavors of this assembly.

a  plate (a thick metal donut which is flat on the side which presses on
the clutch disk, and on its other side gets pressed by the spring).

an outer housing (a larger metal donut which bolts to the flywheel -
these bolts also hold the starter ring gear on - and holds the outside of
the spring and serves to locate the plate which is concentrically located
inside the housing).

What had me confused was the fact that it seems this entire assembly,
along with its bits and pieces,  is called the pressure plate.  And the
custom is to refer to a pressure plate with a cast iron outer housing as a
cast iron pressure plate, and one with an aluminum outer housing as an
aluminum pressure plate, despite the fact that both of these have a cast
iron plate in the middle.  

The 72-77 cars came with the aluminum/cast iron assembly called the
aluminum pressure plate.  It weighs approximately 8.5 lbs. 

The later cars came with the cast iron/cast iron assembly, called the cast
iron pressure plate.  It is the least expensive, and weighs approximately
12.5 lbs.  I think the factory decided that the 3.0 needed more inertia to
keep the idle smooth and make starting from a stop easier.

Discerning minds may wonder about an aluminum/aluminum pressure
plate, where both the plate and the outer housing are aluminum.  One is
available, with some sort of iron or other metal wear surface spray
coated onto the aluminum plate.  This is called the RSR pressure plate,
and is NOT advertised in our favorite catalogs and discount lists.  It looks
like it is configured to give more clamping pressure, although the spring
plate itself looks the same.  Andial listed it for $760 or so several years
ago.  It weighs 4.5 lbs.  Big time (professional) race teams would use
this for one race, after which it would end up on the used parts circuit. 
Mine seems to hold up fine for driver's ed/club racing in my 2.7 and 2.3
race engines over 2 years.  Fingers are crossed.  Don't know longevity
for street use.  Maybe someone has used this on the street and will post
experience.

I have both an RSR style steel flywheel and a stock cast flywheel at the
balancers at the moment, and will weigh them when they get back. 
However, from previous weighings of a borrowed real factory RSR
flywheel, I recall that the difference in weight was a whole lot less
dramatic than these pressure plate differences - maybe as little as one
pound.  On my 3.0 a new steel flywheel did not wear as well as the
used cast iron plate which pressed on the other side of the clutch disk,
and needed resurfacing after about 7 years of street and track use.

So now you know.
