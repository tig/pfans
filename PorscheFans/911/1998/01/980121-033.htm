Hi P-Fans,

I used the Griot's stuff before I moved into my new house.  It takes almost
twice as much as they say it will and it is best applied with a squegee onto
a damp  _not_wet_  floor.  If you want to give it some texture, use the type
of material that you scatter, not the kind that you mix in.  I used the
mix-in and got VERY uneven results.  On a scale of 1-10, my job is a 5
because of that.  

My garage is 20x22 (and a 10x10 storage room) and I did it in one weekend.
If I had used the squegee from the start, I could have done it in one day
and probably used less than 4 gallons of the stuff!  For $1/ft, I might be
interested in doing your floors!  I have considered sanding the finish down
and doing it again without the texture, but otherwise the finish works as
advertised.

Good Luck,

-Bill
