Greetings P-nuts,

I originally posted this ad a couple days before christmas...thought I'd
try it again.

BTW the answer's no, I am not a dealer...I'm just trying to help these two
guys move their cars...

I have here two Targas ('84 and a '74) that need new homes if you know
anyone who may be interested.  I've made a short video of each one.Both of
the (internet challenged) owners are anxious to sell (the '74 more so than
the '84 Carrera)  so, give me a call

Cheers
Thom Kuby


Targa # 1

-'84 3.2ltr Carrera Targa
- 130k miles
- Champagne Gold over Brown partial Leather (sheepskin seat covers in front)
- All original condition (except tires & targa top)
- original owner
- Properly maintained
- All engine receipts,
- excellent daily driver, California Desert car--located Ridgecrest, CA
$15.5K OBO

Targa #2

This one is a '74 with the dreaded 2.7 ltr engine, with 91k orig miles on
it.  I would not reccomend this car car to a "newbie" or "first timer"
simply due to this engine's reputation...having said that, I think this
thing would a make a nice daily driver/project-track or project-resto car
for some one who truely understands the 2.7 model 911.  BTW, the engine
does NOT have upgraded tensioners on it.

some particulars:
- Older re-paint: from bright yellow to dark brown.  the original paint job
was very good, but is showing it's age
- Targa top needs re-building
- fresh shocks on front, so-so shocks on rear
- Good brakes, new master cylinder
- Good runner, good compression, no burning oil
- Does have the "standard" oil leaks
- very straight, no accidents
- very nice fuch alloys on it
- Medium tan interior color
- factory air setup (I think I'd be inclined to tear all that out -- needs
charging at any rate)
- Driver's seat pretty beat, either replace it or re-do it
- passenger seat ok - couple of little tears
- cheap seatcovers on both seats anyway
- original interior carpet is in amazingly good condition - I was pretty
impressed with that
- Glass is in great shape; front, rear and sides
- Car is located Ridgecrest, CA (3.5 hours northeast of Los Angeles)
- I made a short video (VHS) of this car
- $7500 OBO --  The Anxious Owner would like to move it ASAP

I'm sure I've overlooked some details, so, if interested give me a
call...and thanks for all this bandwidth

Cheers

Hi,
I need a little help (again).  I just pulled up the drivers mat in my 88 Cab.
There was an unconnected 2 prong white plug w/blue wires coming from under the
center console.  Before I pull the console to see where it is coming from I
thought that someone might know.  I can not see any connector that it should
be going to.  Any ideas.

2nd question.  Everytime it rains or I wash the car the inner fuzzy strip seal
gets wet so that when I open the window and close it again the window is
soaked.  I just replace the fuzzy strip, the vent seal and the outter window
rubber seal with no change.  It appears that the entire fuzzy strip is wet so
the entire rubber seal must be allowing water in.  Fortunately the water stops
at the fuzzy strip and does not to down into the door.  This is a pain since
you have to clean the window every time you put it up otherwise it drys all
spotted and is difficult to see out of.  Any suggestions.

Thanks

Brian

King,

>> Anybody know if a muffler for a 74 911 will fit a 72 911?  Are the headers 
diffeent diameters?  different mounting ? different outlets on bumper? <<

The outlet pipe has a different angle so it won't work well on
a pre-74 car. I think that's the only difference.
