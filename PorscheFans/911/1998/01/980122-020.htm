Hi Chris,

Answers to your questions.

>1: Fold the wipers forward, "then cut away the rubber seal from outside

>windshield out ?

It appears they mean the  metal trim.  The idea is to cut through the rubber.
Don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.  Just cut.  If the rubber
hasn't hardened--it probably has--you can also do it by carefully, from
inside the car, pushing the rubber lip back under the sealing lip.  Cutting
the old seal is easier though.

Right.  Remove the metal trim--carefully, so as not to bend it, **after**
you have the assembly out of the car.

**YES**.

The diameter isn't critical.  About 1/8" is just about right.  You insert
the string into the groove of the seal before mounting the assembly on the
car.  One trick is to go around the seal twice with the string, so that if
when you
pull it out it there is a spot or two where it missed pulling the seal over
the lip, you get another chance without having to take off the entire
windshield assembly and start over again.  When you lay the string in, the
ends should overlap by about a foot.  Some guys like to start pulling from
the top, some from the bottom.  I don't think it makes any difference.

>7:  Put glycerine on sealing lip and insert windshield at bottom.

Soapy water works fine.

They're telling you to lift the edge of the seal a tiny bit, just enough to
to get the nozzle of a sealing compound under it, and to squeeze the sealer
in, evenly, as you go arounf the windshield.

Some folks use sealing compound, some don't.  I use it if the rubber seal
doesn't look like it's making a tight fit, which ususally occurs along the
top and in the upper corners.

>Thanks for any advice.

You're welcome.  Have fun!
