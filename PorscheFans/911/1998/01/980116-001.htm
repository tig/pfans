Thought I would pass this along, by Paul Lighthill,Riverside Region.

An intermittent miss of occasional complete stoppage of a 911 3.2 engine 
equipped with the DME engine management system may be traced to a poor engine 
electrical ground or a defective cylinder head temperature sensor. Here's the 
fix.

Disconnect all of the ground (brown) wires that are connected to the rear of 
the left side engine intake manifold; clean each of the wire connectors and 
the attach point; reinstall the wires and tighten the fastener. If this does 
not correct the problem, you may have a defective cylinder head temperature 
sensor (located under the engine in cylinder no. 3.

With the car elevated and the engine running, shake the wire leading to the 
sensor. If the engine dies of runs rough the sensor is defective. Using a 
voltmeter you may check the voltage between the sensor and an engine ground 
while running; it will vary from approximately 3 volts cold to less than 2 
volts hot (operating temperature). A spike in the voltage at the same time 
the engine stumbles would indicate a defective head sensor, if there is no 
change in the voltage when the engine misfires the problem is elsewhere. 
Recommends using sensor for 3.6 Carrera 2 engine because the reliability is 
higher, "dedicated ground". (P/N 930.606.013.02) and replacing every 60,000.

Further information is available and includes making a tool for r&r of same. 
Hope this may help some of those 911 problems in recent letters.
