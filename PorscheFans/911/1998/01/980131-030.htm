    No, Brian, it's not... The symptoms you describe are usually
    caused by driving with the handbrake on.

    When you "looked at the brakes" and discovered that "they are not
    dragging", did you actually lift the rear end of the car and try
    to turn the wheels, or did you just check the pads visually? 
    Your 911, I believe, has a separate drum-brake assembly for the
    handbrake, so if the handbrake WERE on, you wouldn't be able to
    tell by looking at the calipers.
