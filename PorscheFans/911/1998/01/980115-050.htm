Dear Stan,

I have an 89 C4.  Most of the C4 folks I've heard from have tranny and brake 
light warnings that stay on for a long time at start up, enough to sound the the 
alarm, but go away shortly after the alarm or after starting off.  Seems to get 
worse in cold weather.  I only had one instance when the alarm went off when 
driving.  This was when I first bought the car and it had been sitting idle at 
the dealer for some time. It went away after re-starting.  Don't remember 
whether the washer light came on.  I have other weird warnings about the tranny 
which seem to be related to an undercharged battery.  Don't know if this helps 
but good luck.

Tad Bacon
