hello,

I've got a strange question. After dismantling my first engine a 72 911
2.4 T I noticed strange makings on the pistons as well a some other
oddities which didn't make any sense.  After finding numerous other
things that were either backwards or put together wrong  I started to
suspect that who ever did any previous work didn"t know what they were
doing and may have used parts from what ever they could get. The markings
on the pistons read as followed.
#1    1  114  E  092        #4   0
#2    1  114  E  092        #5   1   114  E   082 
#3    1  113  E  082        #6    1  113  E   082


  One more thing I noticed is that on pistons #'s  1,2 &  4,5 all have
small hole around the perimeter of the oil control ring  slot which
appears to start from the inside of the piston and extend out word  just
gazing the bottom surface off the slot.  Pistons #'s  3,4 don't have
these holes that extend across the bottom of the oil control ring slot.
Instead  these holes are located about half way up the middle of the slot
.. 


my questions are what do the numbers on the pistons represent? are they
some sort of weight measurements?   and why do other pistons have oil
hole's in different places on the oil control ring slot?    I hope I made
this clear enough for someone to decipherer. 
                                                                         
    
				Thanks for any help

Considering I did the same battery-draining goof on my '95, can offer
two suggestions:

1) Read the radio manual and make sure you're following directions.  
I think if you foul up the "coding" more than a number of times, it
permanently
locks up.

2) Bring it to the dealer and tell him the code doesn't work, let him struggle
with the sucker.

I had the OE code card for my unit, didn't have any trouble.

A friend with a '95 993 with the stock (Becker?) radio has a problem:

After the car sat for several weeks the battery completely died - no
problem, a new battery was purchased and installed - car started and has
been fine ever since   ...with one exception:

The radio keeps asking for a security code.  Got the code from the
dealer, but this doesn't seem to be working.

Any insight on this?  (Please reply directly to banesi@magicrx.com)
