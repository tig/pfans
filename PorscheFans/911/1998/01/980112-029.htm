Hello Pfans,

Yesterday I finally replaced the broken windscreen washer pump, which I
hoped would get me some water spraying on the windscreen again… Not. Pump
was working OK, so I figured the reservoir had to be empty… tried to
refill, but it flooded right away (water was running out underneath the car
from the left front fender). Tried again, no luck… Took the hoses off the
pump and tried sucking it, no water from the reservoir, but it did vacuum,
even with the filler cap off… Can't find any loose hoses (which figures
after all it did create a vacuum). So I looked where the hoses went… like I
said, the left front wheelwell (same place as the oilcooler on the other
fender). It puzzeled me a bit, cause there are two reservoirs there, a big
one upright, with a screw-on-cap from which leads one of the hoses. It also
seems that the hose from the filler (next to the gas-cap) leads to this
reservoir. On to of this reservoir there is a smaller second one (which
appeared empty). Either the bottom reservoir spilled water from the top or
the top reservoir spilled water from the bottom (I couldn't detect it
properly) when it flooded during refill. Anyone got any idea which resevoir
is for what and what might solve my problem (no water from the windscreen
washers). 
Any help is greatly apreciated…
TIA
