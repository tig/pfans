Hi Pfans,

I want to answer some of Garys questions about a '79SC.

I'm driving '76SC Carrera 3.0 having a 5-gear numbered 915/61
and I'm facing the same problem. I read a lot of books about
this issue and found out, that this is a problem of the 915
gearbox itself. Even Porsche changed the sychros many times to
fight this 915 inconvinience. And your '79SC have a 915 gearbox
too.

My solution to this problem is very simple. I use my car only
during summer time. So I changed 3 litres of gear oil to a
mixture of 2 litres of SAE140 G5 gear oil (cut it in pices and
put it into gearbox whole ;-) ) and 1 litres of quite normal
SAE90 G5 as normal lubicant recommended by Porsche itself. I
used this for about 100'km and it works fine. Believe me no
damage! I won't do this in winter times!

Another workaround is to push the clutch pedal down twice or
by pushing the clutch pedal down and shift into second gear
and then into the first one and release the clutch.

>83k orig. miles (believed to be correct); factory sunroof; NO carrera tensioner

>neck snapping acceleration.

Forget to re-build the A/C. Seals are gone and the type of
cooling fuel is not available anymore. 
I'm afraid of the "bubbles" you mentioned. Seems to be that you
will get a small whole there in the near future...
A good idea will be to update the chain tensioners to the newer
ones connected to the oil lines.

Bye
