Ready OK, First off the reason why..... Installed Hella H4's with 80/100 watt
bulbs.
This was great for about 3 months when one night the high/low beam switch got
stuck on high. 
Oh yeah and a bunch of smoke came out of the steering column. :^()
So i ordered the part from Performance just got the 20 % off coupon 2 days
before and wondered what i 
would use it for.... never ever do this... 
The first thing to do is DISCONNECT THE BATTERY then look at the switch and
make sure you have the right one,
I did miraculously and it even had the exact number of wires my old switch has,
no guessing!. 
Remove the horn pad by grabbing both sides and rocking it back and forth with
moderate to gorilla force. You will
notice, after your eyes quit watering from the thing hitting you in the nose
that there is a little brown wire not
connected to anything, worry not look at the back of the horn pad, go pick it
up out of the yard you'll need it later.
Now mark the steering wheel location lest you look like a Winston Cup driver
going down the road.... With a 27mm socket
and extension brace the steering wheel in one hand lock the steering and torque
that puppy off, if you pull to your 
thighs instead of push to the roof you will not need to replace the windshield
when the ratchet slips off....
Now grab the wheel with both hands and rock it back and forth it will come
right off negating a 35.00 puller.
Remove the 2 side screws from the cover and the 4 internal ones as well. The
cover will now come off easily. 
Remove the 2 screws holding on the switch and pry the switch out the back. 
See the little light switch over to the left of the key ? Pry out the center
portion pull on the lights and you will notice
a small hole in the shaft. Insert an Allen wrench hold pressure, now with
needle nose pliers grab the center hub and un-screw.
I used a set of O-ring pliers to unscrew the round holding device now left in
the dash, and switch is easily removed to the floor. 
Cut the wires off the old switch where they come to the contact DO NOT start
disconnecting wires as the switch comes with NO
instructions not even a prayer as to where things go. Cut the wires off the
other 2 connectors up from the main group of 4 as well
and disconnect the plug. 
Now "fish" the wiring out from under the dash it's tight i used the right side
of the shaft area and hold for final inspection.
"Fish" the new wiring through the same route and ONE AT A TIME reconnect the
four main R/w G/Blk Red Wht/Blk etc. connect the plug
and connect the 2 "stragglers" light/blue and gray/stripe and reassemble. The
entire process took me One Hour & Twenty minutes with 15 minutes
looking for misplaced tools.
RELAY Installation: Hella offers a "plug-in" relay for their "high wattage"
bulbs that protects the wussy switch from all the current
generated by the big bulbs. It's supposed to keep you from splicing into the
wiring harness a big plus in my opnion.
I will have it by this weekend and will install and report the status. 
BTW, i replaced my headlights with the stock bulbs until the new relay arrives,
don't need the practice and don't think this would add to
my resume'
