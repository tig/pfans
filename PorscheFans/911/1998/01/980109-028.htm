Dear Bruce (and any other guru on the list),
I know that is becoming a very boring thread, but I do need your final
advice. My 964 turbo (3.3) is running in the best of possible ways, but, as
you know, erratically a noise coming from the dashboard (how can I define
it? a ticking, a crackling, a rattling...) spoiling my Porsche owner's 
full smile. No miss of power, no misbehavior, just that noise appearing
three, four times for ten, twenty minutes and, then, silent for months.
Bruce, other people on the list and common sense suggested the front fuel
pump was ready to leave me, explaining that the position of it is on the
bottom of the car, in spite of the apparent origin of the noise, so I
decided to visit the local official Porsche workshop (operating at very
good standards) for the scheduled oil and filter change and for a new fuel
pump. Obviously the well known "workshop syndrome" suddenly operated: the
noise totally disappeared, the car operated in the most silent way ever, it
was impossible to reproduce in any way the horrid noise. The mechanic, a
very honest person, refuses to change the pump without hearing by himself
the noise, in particular after I referred that the noise, once started,
lasts after ten minutes after I shut off the engine.  On the other side, he
knows very well the unpleasant consequences of a fuel pump spreading metal
particles in the fuel or ending its life in some country roads of my
beautiful, and wild, Island of Sardinia.
But it would be also disappointing  to hear again that rattling after
financing with five hundred bucks the local P-dealer (he actually doesn't
need them for survival...).
To make short a long question, are there other possible sources for a
rattling noise coming from the dashboard (the noise can be heard just 
inside  the car), and with that erratical behavior? How can I induce a fuel
pump noise?
Sorry for being so boring but I do need your advice to take a reasonable
decision.
Thank you in advance

Aldo
