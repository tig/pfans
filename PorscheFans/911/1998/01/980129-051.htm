Hi,

I REALLY hope the dimensions you gave above were typos...

If not, there's over 3.5 inches difference in diameter between your
front and rear tires.

Standard sizes with the *16* inch wheels are 225/50 rear and 205/55 front.
These give front & rear diameters that are almost identical, and this is
what the car was designed to work with.

Roughly "stock" diameters with 17 inch wheels would be:

- 225/45 or 245/40 rear
- 205/50 or 225/45 front

(just a couple of examples)

If you really have 255/50 17 inchers in back, your speedometer will be way
off, and the car will be in a nose-down attitude. I'd also be concerned
about rubbing!

You don't have ABS, so at least you won't put that out of kilter (differing
diameters between front and rear will really confuse an ABS system!)

Cheers,

Ross
