Thanks.  Since I posted this someone else might have an idea as well.
I would like to take it off and paint it so that when the whole shebang
goes back in and I look at it there will be significant evidence of the
effort.
Another thing.  When I pulled the plugs out, prior to adjusting the
valves which is now done, one plug was rather dry feeling on the way out
and appears to possible have been cross threaded (yow!).  the threads
are slightly flattened and I am fearful that when I reinstall a new one
that it will not seat properly.  Any suggestions?  How difficult is a
helicoil and is it right for this application?
WSC
