Does anybody know of a source in the San Diego area for a windshield for a 72
911?  Has anybody had any luck mail ordering glass?  Also any tips on
installing this would be appreciated.  I understand the installation
procedure, but I am unsure about using a sealer under the rubber.  All
writings I have seen about glass installations seem to skip over this, but the
old rubber in my car had a great deal of black silicone-like stuff under it
and every windshield I have had professionally installed in my other vehicles
has gotten the goo.  Also, does the rear targa glass need an additional
sealer?

Primarily the DOT stamp on the tire is the proof that they're street legal.
That's the US Department of Transportation stamp that's required to be on
street legal tires in the US.

I would expect 12,000 miles to be close to what the tires would get. Most
people here are combining street driving with autocrossing and the tires don't
last nearly that long. I'd be more concerned with the cracks. These tire must
be fairly old. How long have they been on the car. Most people suggest
replacing tires more than 3-5 years old. There was a recent article on how to
tell the age of a tire, when you buy it. Some tires lay around awhile i guess.
I'll try to find it for you.

I'm very surprised to hear your problem driving in water. Most people here
like them. It's making me think that your tires must be very old and hard.
Except for the noise they make at speed, many people here are enjoying the
Yokohama A032 for both street and track use.

The best tire I've ever driven on, however, is the Bridgestone S02. Stock tire
on many new Boxsters, twin turbos and 993's. Best street tire!!!!!

How many miles a year do you drive and how long have you had your car.
