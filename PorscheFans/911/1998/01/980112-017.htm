My local PCA region (San Diego) does (IMHO) a superb job of driver=92s
education. I=A0have been suggesting that we do a one day event for our
region=92s teenage drivers (age 16 - 20).

The main purpose of this course would be to teach high school age
drivers how to be safe on the highway. Obviously, this would not be a
typical PCA drivers training that culminates in an autocross or a high
speed driving event. I would also have the teenagers use the car THEY
will be driving, not Dad (or Mom's) 993 twin turbo (in my son=92s case,
Mom=92s 1983 Chev Cavalier station wagon).

My initial thoughts are to have it a one day event. I would include a
skid pad; accident avoidance (3 choice at end of a strait, swerve left,
right or hard braking with a flagman who indicates which way the student
must go); braking exercise; perhaps a increasing/decreasing radius
curves on a small oval, etc. We should be able to get the California
Highway Patrol to come out and give an hour talk on Drunk Driving and
their views of traffic safety (i.e., the Fear of God talk).=20

If we can keep one student from getting killed or seriously injured
before he/she turns 21, then the course will (IMO) have been successful.
This is the initial stage of my putting together a proposal to give to
our PCA=A0region. I=92d very much appreciate getting the list=92s
opinions/suggestions. Because of the 16 - 18 age bracket, I suspect a
major problem will be getting insurance. Again any suggestions would be
helpful.
