Hello All,

I'm here in sunny rainy San Francisco, CA and I own a '80 911 SC Targa,
and as with most Targas, I am somewhat DAMP inside.  I have seen various
posts in the past regarding stopping leaks and at this point I have
pretty much figured out where most of my water is coming from.  However,
the floor (especially in the back seat) is REALLY WET, and I can't seem
to figure out where THAT leak might be.  I have removed the SOAKING WET
floor mats and with all the rain we have been getting (damn el nino),
there is a serious amount of moisture in my car (I have seen the posts
regarding moisture removers and am planning on buying something this
weekend before the whole car starts to smell funky).  Does anyone have
an idea where to look for the floor leak...could it be coming down the
window through the door jam?  

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Also, I am still looking for replacement front tires if any one has any
other suggestions.

TIA,
SCOTT (swimming in my Targa!!)
.
