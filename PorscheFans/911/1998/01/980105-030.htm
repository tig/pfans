Greetings Porsche fans,
       Thanks to those who responded to my question regarding mechanical
chain tensioners. One who I consider to be a 
definitive authority ( I won't take the liberty of quoting by him by name
but I will say that his book on the 911 is excellent) 
said " I don't think there is a correct way to adjust them, thats why you
don't see many around anymore."  
       I would like to include a little background on the car for the
benefit of those who may have these tensioners in your
street cars ( I suspect that there are more than a few out there). I know
the PO of the car and he installed the mechs.
14 years / 70,000 miles ago during an engine rebuild and adjusted them at
about 12,000 miles after the rebuild and says 
they haven't been touched  since. The engine runs great and has no chain or
other valve train noise that I can detect.
       Anyway, the car is currently up on jack stands for some suspension
work and while its up there I'll install new tensioners,
late chain wheel supports and ramps. If I run into anything that looks like
abnormal wear or damage caused by these 
tensioners I'll post it.
