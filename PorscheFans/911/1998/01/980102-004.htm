Vrba,

Welcome to Colorado.  You'll have a ball working at Winter Park.

There are several very good shops in the Denver area.  Since WP is about 70 miles from Denver, convienience will probably come into play.  On the southwest side of town, there is Motorsports which is owned by Pat Moyle.  He works on my vintage car and helps me a lot when I am doing the work.  The phone is 922-3560 and the street address is 1921 Yale.

There are several other shops.  Carquip in Boulder generally gets good marks from people I know that us is and I've used Storz in east central Denver which is good.

Motorsport and Carquip are the two easiest to get to from Winter Park although neither is close to where I-70 comes out of the mountains.
