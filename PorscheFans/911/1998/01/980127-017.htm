If they still have it, I'd recommend the factory tour instead of the museum
if you have to pick one.  I found it more interesting than a bunch of cars
that were mostly old track cars.  It was cool, but I thought seeing engines
assembled, etc was much better.

Also in the parking lot on the factory grounds you may see lots of nice
new turbos, etc.  I got some good pictures there.

my 2 cents,
