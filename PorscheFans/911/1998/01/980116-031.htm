Ted,

    Good questions! The GPS receivers today are much better than just a
few years ago in tracking with limited signal availability, but if the
car is fully covered, as deeply buried in a garage, then GPS will be
lost. However the new cell phones seem to work well in most covered
areas and penetrate better into buildings than GPS. As long as you can
access the digital cell phone you know where the car was up to the point
where GPS was lost and the exact time, and that's usually good enough to
locate the car unless it's being moved around underground (highly
unlikely). Even if you can't access the digital cell phone you still can
locate the last GPS position and its exact time as soon as you achieve
communication with the digital cell phone, this will also give you a
good chance in recovering the car. I understand that Discovery will have
something on the criminal tracking Friday Jan 16 at 9 PM EST, you might
want to check this out. I'm looking for some funding to help with the
development of this project, the criminal tracking people aren't
interested because the volume is nowhere near the criminal tracking and
they can't charge the car owners $15-$20 per day for monitoring. And
besides, they can't satisfy the criminal market now, and I don't see
them having any free engineering time to devote to anything in the near
future--good news for them but bad news for other projects.

    Best regards,

    Mike Wyatt
