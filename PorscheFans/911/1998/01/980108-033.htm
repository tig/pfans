Nathan Fornwalt has a bad cylinder in his 76 and wonders what
performance mods he should make along the way, etc, and best
suspension mods, listing some he has in mind.

Pure unadulterated opinion from me (who started with a 77):  Rebuild the
2.7 with timecerts and the Racewear studs and whatever else you find
needs fixing when you tear down your motor.  Leave the rest of the car
alone unless the shocks are bad.  If you can't resist, lower it a bit.  Install
the '74 heat exchangers or an SSI exhaust system and a muffler you like
(it is donwright unAmerican not to do something with the exhaust on a
car).  Drive it and enjoy it.  It is hard (maybe impossible) to beat the
factory's compromises between ride and handling for a street car.  Use
the money you saved for something else, or to purchase an SC.  At least
wait until you feel you are actually outdriving (on the street) your car.

You didn't say if you have autocrossing, driver's education/time trial, or
racing ambitions, beyond just having a fine car to drive.  However, my
advice is basically the same:  put your money into getting a lot of seat
time in these activities (not racing, don't start there unless you've done it
before), and into instruction at PCA events with instruction or at one of
the professional driving schools.  You can spend a lot of money doing
this, and have a heck of a good time doing it  (or spend not a lot of money
if you only go the PCA route).   When your driving skills exceed the car
(or, to be more realistic, start approaching the limits of the car in stock
form), start adding the upgrades.

By then you will know a lot, or at least have been exposed to a whole lot
of opinions, by reading this list and schmoozing with fellow Pfanatics at
tracks or big autocross parking lots.  In addition, you may conclude that
instead of messing with a car you drive a lot on the street and highways
and byways and love and maybe have made cosmetically perfect, you
should buy an older or at least less perfect car at a modest price and
make a dedicated track car out of it, where you won't be compromising
ride with handling, etc.

And because you can't resist doing something (beyond just getting your
22 year old car back to 100%, which for mine which was a mere seven
years old when I got it took some doing), how about turbo tie rods?  You
won't notice any difference now, which is good, because it won't mess
up the ride, even if it is down low on the list of useful go-fasts.

Just one man's suggestion.  

Walt Fricke (wondering where he would be if he had followed this
advice more closely)

PS:  I bet the Motormeister prices for rebuilds are with a like core motor in
good rebuildable condition.  Usually a 2.7 doesn't count as a core for a
3.0.  Also, putting a 3.0 into a 2.7 is really pretty easy, as they use the
same CIS system so the whole fuel system is compatible down to the
last little fitting.  Adding the mini-brain, if you get a 3.0 with that, isn't hard.
 I did this when I put a 3.0 in my 2.7 after the motor blew up and I had
already put on the SC flares when I had car repainted.   A 3.2 gets more
complicated, as I think the plumbing and maybe fuel pump are different,
along with adding the DME parts.
