Subject: GPS Tracking

Hi,

    I'm just posting this to get some feedback on an idea I'm working
on, responses are welcome both pro and con. I've been involved (as a
consultant, I'm an EE) in the development of a tracking system for
criminals out on parole or on house arrest. This system utilizes GPS and
Cellular telephone technologies to keep track of these individuals 24hrs
a day. I have been working on an approach to include this technology
within automobiles to implement a tracking system with the ability to
record the whereabouts of the car and where it has been over the past
24hrs. The idea is to install this system covertly into the engine
compartment. If the car is missing, then the owner simply calls up the
cars phone number with a standard MODEM & PC and the whereabouts of the
car is displayed on a computers screen, the entire running 24hrs history
of the cars whereabouts can also be displayed. If the car has been
stolen the owner simply calls the police and tells them where the car is
and has been, or could even FAX them the map! The only recurring charge
for this would be the cell phone monthly fee. This system could be
implemented in a very cost effective manner with a target price of less
than $1000 in quantify production and could even break $500 with some of
the new low cost GPS receivers and cell phones coming out.

    Please let me know what you think of this idea. I would like to have
this on my 933 Porsche, just for some piece of mind and to make sure my
kids aren't taking it for a ride without dad's permission. Heck, I could
even make sure they are going where they say they are if  I want to be a
snoop, but I wouldn't have wanted my dad to have this so maybe the snoop
idea isn't such a good idea. Anyway, your comments are appreciated.

    Thanks,

    Mike Wyatt
