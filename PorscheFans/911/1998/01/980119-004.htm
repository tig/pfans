Hi PFans,

has anybody tried the Automotion "Quiet" kit for reducing wind noise 
around the door frames? It consists some plugs and seals to apply to 
the door and apparently reduces the wind noise.

Anybody used these and have an opinion on whether they are worth the 
$12?

thanks

terry

 Also, we're looking for a Lexan windshield. If anyone has one for sale I'd
 like to know. We're also looking for a good manufacturer of lexan glass to
 distribute through our company, Trackside Products. If anyone can suggest a
 source...... >>
Pro Glass Corp., 847-952-0135, makes Lexan windshields for most Porsches.
They are also the source for NASCAR and severla other racing bodies. They are
located near Chicago, and also sell direct.  They don't stock many
windshields, so it normally takes a couple of weeks to get it.

 Does anyone have an opinion on the Sportomatic Transmission ('70 911)?
 I am thinking of purchasing a 911 that has this transmission...  Is
 there anything that I should check out on the transmission?  How does
 this type of transmission operate/feel when driving?
 
 Is it semi-automatic?  What does the mean? >>

We had a '71 911T with a Sporto.  Really different to drive.  You can start up
in 1st or 2nd as it has a torque convertor.  It has microswitches in the
gearshift lever that disengage a clutch to shift gears.  However, any time you
touch the lever it disengages the clutch!  But in town in traffic, you can
just leave it in 2nd and putt around.  Ours lasted about a year before I
converted it to a 5speed.  Everthing is there to do it, you just need the
trasnmission, clutch, flywheel, cable, pedal cluster etc.  In my opinion, the
only reason to buy a Sporto is to get a rustfree chassis, to put a 5 speed in!
If you don't have that, I'd stay away.  The Sporto set up is fairly complex,
with a fair number of adjustments.

If you are seeing rust arond the front suspension, it is probably because one
of the batteries leaked (it has two).  Look aroung the battery boxes for other
signs of corrosion.  If that is the only rust on the car, it can be fixed for
a few hundred dollars.  Aftermarket welded in  pans for that area are
available.  It should be done by someone familiar with 911 rust repair.  If
the rest of the chassis is rusted, stay away.
