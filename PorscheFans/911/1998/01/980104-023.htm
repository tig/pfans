Hi Moe,

I bought the 55/60 watts, not from J.C. Whitney, but from Performance 
about two years ago.  I think I paid $15.00ea for them on closeout.  
I can get the brand name for you if you want.  The ones that I got 
are substantialy better than the original sealed beams.  Plenty 
bright for the unlighted canyon roads that I drive. {:-))  You can 
always change the bulbs at a later date if you want.  They are 
available from Performance.  I don't know if all H-4's have standard 
plugs.  Will you be able to plug the lights in using your existing 
connecter?

I'd be careful about increasing wattage.  I seem to recall from other 
posts, that the early Porsches wire the headlights through the light 
switch on the dash, not a relay.  I don't know how high you can 
safely go. 

Take Care,
Ken
