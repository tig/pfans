Yousef,

Well, you seem to be in luck, or not, depending on how you look at it as
your problem sounds a lot like one that was just fixed on my car.  Could
it be that your throw out bearing is beginning to seize or the shaft it
is riding on has become untrue?  The smallest discrepancy seems to
really screw things up.  The fix was to replace the entire rod the
bearing rides on and the bearing itself (along with the clutch, but I
needed a new one of those anyway).  In order to do this, the tranny
needs to be taken apart.  In my case it needed it anyway so I was not to
dismayed to find this out.  While it is apart you might consider doing
an entire rebuild(synchros,dog rings, what have you), since you will be
paying for/doing all the labor to get it out of the car anyway.  If you
have to do this you could also adjust the valves as it is a lot easier
with the engine out };)

Everything on my car from the pedal through the tranny to the flywheel
is new/rebuilt because of this 'small' problem.  I guess the car is now
ready to start the next 70k miles of its life with me at the wheel };).

Or, maybe you just need to adjust the clutch cable and rubber stopper
that prevents the clutch peddle from going through the floor.  Obviously
try this one first as it is most cost effective.  You might want to
check the cable for wear when it enters the tunnel as I heard somewhere
that that was a common place.  If it is worn it could be that it has
stretched and thus not disengaging the clutch as much as before.  Just
replace the cable and adjust it as it says in the Haynes or factory
manuals.

Good Luck!

-Michael
