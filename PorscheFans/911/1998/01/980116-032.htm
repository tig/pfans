Having read through George's message below before observing his
email address, my thought was "this guy must work for Yokohama." 
Upon subsequently noticing the email address, I discovered that my
supposition was indeed correct!

On the merits, I'll just say, as I've said before, that I've been running R1's
(and 008RS's) on the street for 10 years, and have nothing but pleased
with both.  I've only had sidewall cracking problems with the R1's once,
and the tire was replaced free of charge under my warranty from
America's Tire.

Finally, even if everyone could afford to run two sets of tires and
wheels, the purpose of running the R1's on the street is to have the kind
of performance the tire offers at one's disposal at all times.  It sure
works for me!

Subject: 	Re: Driving Race Tires on the Street

Differing manufacturers of DOT-approved racing tires have differing
views on
driving their products daily on the street.  Some things to consider:

Yokohama A-008RS, A-008RSII, and A-032R tires are designed to be
street
durable.  That is you can drive them daily.  Other manufacturers' tires are
not.  In fact, many of them advise you do not drive them daily.  Some
tires,
such as the BFG R1, may suffer cracking in the sidewall due to the
stress of
daily driving (Source: Team T/A Newsletter).

However, be warned!!  These tires have shallow tread depths. (Most are
molded
in 6/32"; street tires usually have at least 10/32")  This means reduced
water
evacuation and reduced wet performance.  The best tire in this area is
the
A032R with its unique "Aqua Tusk" Grooves.  

Also, these tires have unique compounds.  Driving them daily reduces
their
track life by putting them through unnecessary "heat cycles."  That is the
warming and cooling of these tires when you drive then park them.  This
heat
cycle consumes binders such as sulfur which reduce the elasticity of
the
compound.  Eventually the compound will harden and will last longer, but
will
not achieve the optimum grip as the tire with fewer heat cycles.

The most cost-efficient method is to have two separate sets of tires. 
One for
street use and one for track use.
