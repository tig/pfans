I purchased a `77 911 at auction some 
time back as a restoration project. This 
car was in the process of being restored when the government seized it
from it`s unfortunate owner. The body had been converted to turbo look
with fiberglass
slant nose, boxed  rockers and a `78 style turbo tail. In other words,
not exactly an unmolested original. I have been working on updating the
bodywork  (C2 ultra wide w/3.8 rs tail) and my attention is now starting
to wander towards the mechanical side of things. The car has what I at
first thought was a stock 930 turbo motor, but now I`m not so sure. The
engine type # is 930/04 with a serial # of 6281532. Bruce Andersons 911
handbook lists this as a 3.0 l normally aspirated motor from a 78/79 SC,
yet it has all the oem turbo stuff (intercooler, dual fuel pumps, turbo
boost guage in the tach, oem turbo etc.  My understanding is that when
they went to the intercooler, the displacement  was 3.3l so I`m not sure
if I have a stock 78/79 turbo motor (with an error Bruces` chart)
or a bastard  SC motor with added on turbo parts. If the latter is the
case, what
problems might I be in for in turboing a motor that was not designed for
it (compression ratios,  bearing strength, head studs and all that good
stuff)  Are there any external cues to what I`m dealing with, or am I in
for a tear down to
see what`s up?
