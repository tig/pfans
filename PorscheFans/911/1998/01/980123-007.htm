Hey man, thats beautiful...
I have wondered about that for a while. I love the sporto but in australia
they knock $8K AUS off, for the privilege. If I change it I might regret it
in the long run because for me it is a city car with incredable style. 

If you want a sporto they are scatered all over this land - no prob's...

so what do I do? will I won't I?

I think for me I may still have to, but it will cost $1,800US for a car
worth $7,000US.......HELP!

    There aren't many Sportomatics left in service.  You will make more
    money in the long run with a Sportomatic (original) than a 5-speed. The
    last factory Sportos were made in May '79.
    
    Also, if you're on the mobile phone a lot you can leave it in 2nd and
    travel between 0 and 100 miles per hour (and use it like an automatic)
    easily
    
    The Tiptronic trans are now trying to do a similar thing that the
    Sportos did
    
    If you actually do the operation can I buy the servo?  It's the grey
    cylindrical device with the chromed strip around the waistline and with
    the metal arm/prong coming out of the hole in the middle of the three
    threaded studs.  It's also got that thin pipe coming off the bottom -
    that's where the vacuum pump attaches.
