Carl:

    Your mechanic is probably describing what most of us would call
    "glazing"... Turning your rotors may correct it (at the expense
    of making them more prone to overheating in the future), but you
    might also want to find out what kinds of pads are on the car;
    some high-performance pads (notably those of the carbon-Kevlar
    variety) just squeal a lot more than the stock pads do.

Chip:

    Carl may want to replace his pads with a different compound, but
    the "failure" of his mechanic to recommend new pads because the
    old ones had only 20% remaining is NO REASON for him to seek out
    a new mechanic.

    "Twenty percent remaining" doesn't mean that the pads are only 20%
    as effective as they were when new... The pads will still
    (assuming no damage anywhere else) work just as well as they
    always did.
