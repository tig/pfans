Hi Fans,

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah! Just got finished bringing my wife's new 78
SC home (dark grey metallic, black leather); an hour trip during which
my five senses were in overload the whole time.  Now I know how race
drivers feel on the last lap of a race they're leading...

The car drives and handles superbly; everything I expected.  The clutch
seems a little tight, but would say that's probably normal and its just
been awhile since I experienced that sensation.  

Checked the oil upon arrival (idling, level ground, fully warm) and
found it is at the lower mark, which corresponds to the gauge - just
above the red...so will be adding a "safety" quart, since we are
definitely NOT overfilled.

Everything works!  There is a leak somewhere through one of the windows,
though the windshield rubbers appear in good condition and firmly
set...so we'll be checking this out next week.

Right now, we're off to San Diego for a long weekend of driving our new
baby.
