<<1.  First, as the Dino was built for leaded gas, is their any
availability of this type of gas in the Southeast? Is it prudent to use
it if available? I presently put one of the leading manufacture lead
substitutes in it, just as a precaution. Is this advisable or a waste of
money?>>

Steve,
Using leaded fuel or a lead additive is a waste of money in the opinion
of both me and my Porsche tech.  Your engine will perform the same and
will not wear any quicker than normal.  Just use the highest octane fuel
possible.

<<2. As both the Dino and my 993 are not driven much (about 80 miles a
month on lube runs, and an occasional outing during the summer months) I
have been adding STABIL to the gas. Is this a good practice, or are
there better alternatives?>>

80 miles a month is pretty darn near a tank of gas if you are driving
the cars hard.  I don't think that adding STABIL is necessary with your
kind of driving schedule.  If you were letting the cars sit for months
at a time tehn the additive might be a good idea.  Just some friendly
advice ... with such nice cars you should drive them more!  Take them to
work every once in a while.  Go out for a weekend cruise.  Enjoy them!!
