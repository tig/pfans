Hi Terry -

You asked about repairing the fuel level sender in your SC, saying that your
gage sticks at about half-mast.  I have a similar problem in my '87 Carrera,
and tried once to fix it.  Not too successful.

The sender is housed in an aluminum cylinder about 40mm in diameter, maybe
300 mm long.  It can be removed easily from inside the front trunk.  There is
a rubber gasket which you might want to replace - I reused mine and it seems
OK.

Fuel enters the aluminum cylinder through a couple of pinholes in the side.
Withdraw it slowly to let fuel drain into tank, or quickly catching fuel in
large towel.  Removing the cylindrical housing, you'll see the sender unit has
a slider/float assembly that runs along two long thin wires.  Apparently the
electrical circuit measures a resistance which changes as the slider moves
along the wires.  There are also two contacts at the bottom of the sender that
close when it reaches the bottom of the housing (empty tank).  These activate
the warning lamp.  The entire unit seems very delicate.

I cleaned the wires very carefully with a mild enamel reducer (paint thinner)
and a toothbrush.  Was a bit more agressive with the contacts on the bottom,
using #600 sandpaper very gently.  After re-assembly, the warning lamp now
seems to function properly, but the gage still sticks at about 3/8 tank.

I'm tempted to go back in and use the sandpaper on the thin wires, and their
contacts on the slider assembly.  Theory is that some sort of varnish has
built up on them.  But others have posted saying this is a frustrating
problem.  So please post your results for all of us to benefit.  Sure is
embarassing filling your Porsche with a little red gas can on the side of the
road ;-)

Cheers,

- Brad
