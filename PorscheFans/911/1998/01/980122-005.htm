Classical physics goes out the window in the interaction between
tires and the road.  The shape and oreintation of the contact patch
becomes important.  Once a tire starts to "slip" relative to the road,
small chunks or rubber are torn away from the tire's surface.  I think
this is why the contact patch's shape, area and orientation are
important.  If you notice, in racing, the "long" direction of the contact
patch is oriented with the axis that will be experiencing the highest
loads.
