Bob,
Having converted the SC brakes on my car to Porsche 930 turbo brakes, I can
lead you through the process and advise you on who to talk to about
machining and parts. Realize that this conversion requires the use of 16
inch wheels to clear the calipers. I do not know if the width is critical
and I run 7" or 8" fronts and 10" rears.
First you will need to purchase a set of front and rear 930 calipers. They
can come from any year 930 after 1977 up to but not including 1992 (3.6
turbo?). The 1976 and 1977 930's used the 911 carerra brakes and I assume
that you are not interested in them (although that would be a much easier
upgrade for you and a direct bolt on I believe)
FRONTS.
The front calipers are a direct bolt on with the proper turbo caliper
spacers that set up the caliper so that it is centered on the rotor. The
spacers (front and rear) and the caliper mounting bolts (change them and put
them on with some anti-seize) can be ordered from VCI (800.845.5948) in NJ.
VCI specializes in porsche brakes and breaking components and do excellent
work. Have them send you a catalog and they have some very useful pictures
of what I am referring to here on the front hats you will need. The trick to
the front brake assembly is using the proper hat/disk assemble. The hat/disk
MUST come from an early 930 brake system that dates 1978 - 1980.
Anotherwords it is the hat assembly that postdates the earliest Carerra
brakes on 930's (1976-1977) but not the brake hat disk that they put on the
later models (1981 and later) These do not need to be full floating rotors,
that is up to you. For street use, I would not recommend full floaters as
they can be noisy. I purchased the hats, rotors (grooved not drilled) from
The Racers Group in CA and have been very pleased with them. I also had
purchased the 930 front and read calipers used from them as well. You could
also get the hats and rotors from VCI as well as a variety of other places.
I do not care for the factory cross drilled rotors as the tend to develop
hair line cracks in them. You will need to change the backing plates for the
brake coolers as the ones that you are using are to small for the 930 front
rotors. you can buy the backing plates for Alan Johnson Racing (AJR) of
modify yours.
REARS
The rears require that you have the rear calipers machined so that they will
fit on your non- 930 SC swingarm. This can be done by VCI at a cost of about
$300 or so. You ship them your rear 930 calipers, they machine them and send
them back to you. The rear rotors you will need are from any year 930, 1978
and on. I use factory ones as the quality seems better than aftermarket.
With this setup your emergency brake will be functional.
You will also need to change your master cylinder to a 930 master cylinder
as I don't believe that your stock one will have enough volume to handle
these larger brakes. The master cylinder is a bolt on (all be it a pain to
do). You will not need a proportioning valve with this setup as the rear
brakes are not large enough when compared to the fronts. You may also want
to consider changing your break lines to SS ones that attach to the
calipers.
Add your favorite brake fluid (ATE Super Blue works well), and some 930 pads
(I've tried them all and for track events Pagid seem to stop best, last
longest and be the most rotor friendly, but they do squeal if that bothers
you on the street), and you will have one eye popper of a  stopper, compared
to what you have now.
Good luck with your project.
Terry

Hey all,

        I have been informed by my mechanic that I need new CV joint(s).  I
hear a noise that only seems to come from the right side of the car.  But he
says that it is possible all four are worn out. With CV joints @ 90$ each,
plus labor, this could end up being a seriously expensive bill.  From reading
the past posts, it seems that you can take a worn out CV joint from the right
side of the car, and swap it with one on the the left side of the car.  About
how much mileage do you get out of the swap versus just replacing? 
        If BOTH sides of the car need new CV's, then it would be econmically
smarter to do the swap, than buy new ones, cause you would have  had to pay
the labor to take apart various parts of the drive train's on BOTH sides.
But, if only ONE side of the car has CV joints that need to be replaced, would
it be more expensive in labor to do the swap?  Cause there would be all that
extra labor to take out the CV joint, on the other side, that did not need to
be replaced.  So basically what I am saying is, about how long does it take a
good mechanic to take out (one or both) CV's on a given side?  Is it only
beneficial to do the swap if BOTH sides need replacing?

PS: please don't respond saying I should do the work myself myself, cause I
won't!
