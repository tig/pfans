Invitation to Porsche-Travel Mille Miglia Travel 98


Dear Porsche-Friends,

Mille Miglia Travel 98 together with Travel Agency Rampinini, Como have
worked out a package for a Porsche-Friends
group to travel to the Mille Miglia in May 1998 (the Mille Miglia runs
from May 14th to 17th 1998, the Start/Finish is in
Brescia Italy).

It is one of worlds most historic road races, running through
breathtaking Northern Italy and is unique in fact that you
can drive (not race) on the same roads as the competitors, while the
event takes place.

It is the intention of a group of PorscheFansEurope from various
European countries to travel to this event. The
various National groups will assemble in their own countries and travel
to Italy in convoy. We will arrange interesting
stops along the way and arrange to meet up with European Club members
(whether they are or are not travelling to
the Mille Miglia ) along the way.

THE ACTUAL MILLE MIGLIA ITINARY IS AS FOLLOWS:

The Porsche-Friends will meet together on the afternoon of May 13th for
the first time in Como (Italy), at the Hotel
Como. We will sort our Porsches into driving groups of up to 5 cars
each, out of our MAXIMUM of 15 cars. Each group
being led by an experienced Porsche-Friend. Each group can make their
own routes/timetable for the trip period or
use the route suggested. After this there is time to get to know one
another, talk about Porsches etc, have dinner and
overnight there.

On morning of May 14th we all drive to Brescia, there we can look the
race cars and experience the atmosphere of the
event as they prepare to run the Mille Miglia. Early on evening we drive
to a restaurant nearby the route. There we have
dinner and await for the first participants, when they have passed us,
we drive within the field to Ferrara, then to
Minerbio where our hotel is (30km away from Ferrara).

On May 15th, we follow the field on the official route in two or three
groups (max. 5 cars each) via Ravenna-Rimini-San
Marino-Gubbio-Spolento (on the way we pass the two most impressive
sections of the Mille Miglia the Monti Sibilini and
Monte Terminillo) to the area of Rieti, there we take a short cut from
the original race route to Soirano nel Cimino. It is
nearby Viterbo where our hotel is located. We could then enjoy the pool
and a dine on a meal typical of the region.

On May 16th, we meet the Oldtimer at Viterbo after short drive. We drive
within the race field north through the
Toskana via Montefiasione, Siena to Florenz. We pass Florenz before the
Oldtimer competitors to arrive earlier at the
most impressive points of the 3rd day (the Futa and the Raticosa Pass).
On the late afternoon we arrive at our hotel in
Bologna and after our farewell Dinner we will have drinks at the hotel
bar.

On May 17th there is set no program. Everybody can do whatever they
want. Some may wish to set off and go directly
home but some of us will make a little Detour on the way back to the
Ferrari exhibition in Modena.

Bill,

>> Does anyone know the specific differences between the 2.2 E Mechanical
injection pump and the 2.4 E pump? <<

I have the book but don't remember exactly. I 
think maybe an overrun valve or something insignificant.

> Is the space cam the same by any chance?

Not sure but I'd guess that the 2.2E pump would 
work OK on a 2.4E especially for racing.

> Seeking 2.4 E long block or heads/cams.  All leads appreciated.

I am planning on buying a '73 E Coupe for parts
for my RS. It has a running 2.4E MFI engine with SSI
exhaust. I could sell the engine for $3000, less
without the MFI. I will also have a good non-sunroof
shell available for sale, and many other parts. I'm in CT.
