Hiya.  I have a 1969 911T with a fairly modified 2.7 in it right now.  I
recently blew an oil line and the engine seized :(...  I do not plan on
paying to have a 2.7 rebuilt because of all the bad things I have heard
about there reliability.  I would like to upgrade to a 3.2 or a 3.6,
otherwise I would not feel like I am gaining anything from blowing up my
engine :)  My question is, what is the cheapest way to get a good engine. I
can live with just a used engine but would prefer a rebuilt.  I am in
Arizona, but have heard that 911 parts are more plentiful in CA, and I
would not mind that trip.  Would should I expect to pay for a 3.2 or 3.6? 
Does anyone have on in the AZ area they might want to sell?

I also have some Fuchs style 15x8 Rims, with nice tires, recently polished,
make me an offer if ya want em.

Thanks, 
Mason :)
