Hi Juha,

I have a hunch that You are a Finn? so I have to reply.

There is two brakelight switches and they are connected
electrically in paralell. A first tought is that one has failed
and the other one is on the way. I suggest You use a =

multimeter and check the function on both. They a normally
open and when brake applied, they close.
The switches are located in master cylinder, on left side
looking from front of car. In -84 to -86 there was two types of
switch used, p/n 113 945 515 G for 3-pole and =

113 945 515 H for a 2-pole switch, so check what You have. =


Access is somewhat limited, othervise easy to change and
this give You a good reason to change brake fluid also.
Remember that brake fluid will damage paint.

If You need more info, do not hesitate to contact me.
