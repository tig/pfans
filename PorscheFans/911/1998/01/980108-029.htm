I've heard of a technique which I will call 'dipping':
Get a pan with a diameter larger than spokes but smaller than rim.  Place 
wheel face up on pan. Painted portion of wheel should be lower than top of 
pan.  Level the wheel.  Pour paint into pan thru holes between spokes until it 
covers the portion of the wheel you want painted.  Drain paint from pan 
(forgot to mention......drill hole in pan and plug it before you start this 
procedure).

I've never used this technique....but it sounds like it would produce nice 
straight edge.

I bought a 1976 Porsche 911S Targa in June of 1996.

I have been interested in restoring and improving the car and have made
several repairs and restorations to this point. I would be interested in
any comments or information you may be able to provide regarding the
following. I am entertaining the idea of rebuilding the engine in the
near future. The present 2.7 engine had been updated with oil-fed chain
tensioners, and I have installed an eleven-blade fan, K&N air filter,
etc. Now, though, the number five cylinder has developed a compression
leak. One option is to just rebuild the present engine with raceware
studs, etc. The other option is to replace it with a rebuilt 3.0 SC or
3.2 engine. Can you give advice as to the feasibility of this upgrade
and comment on any modifications to any other systems (wiring, fuel,
emissions, etc.) that would be affected (what specifically may need to
be done)? I have already considered upgrading the exhaust to Borla. If
an engine upgrade is done, would you suggest different cam profiles,
valves, valve springs, rockers, higher compression pistons etc. for
higher top end and more performance? Would an enlarged throttle body be
a good upgrade for the money? What specifically would you recommend? I
have also been interested in upgrading the suspension with gas Koni's or
Blistein's, 22mm Weltmeister front and rear adjustable sway bars, and
front camber brace. For these various upgrades, what specifically would
you recommend, and what suppliers would offer good quality at a
reasonable cost? An add in excellence magazine for Motor Meister in
California caught my eye for their price on a rebuilt 3.0 or 3.2
($3595/$3995).  Has anyone had any experience with them or recommend
anyone else? 
Also, has anyone repainted their original Fuchs?  Do you have
suggestions as to how to tape off the center "star" so that a
consistent, smooth line is acheived? Is there a pattern I can buy and
what kind of paint is best?

What it all comes down to is this: What suspension and engine upgrades
show the most fundamental and worthwhile performance increases for the
money. Anything you could contribute would be very greatly appreciated.
I am interested in doing as much of the work as possible myself as a
hobby. 
Please excuse the message length, I am new at this and have many
questions.
Thank you in advance for your help and advice.

I assume you're using the 255/40Z17 on the rear of your 96 Carrera.
Bridgestone SO2's are 270.00, Dunlop SP8000's are 209.00, Continentals are
183.00.

Heat cycling adds $12.50 per tire plus shipping

Among these three tires I'd choose the Bridgestone, hands down. Having driven
them for a good, hard weekend in a Porsche Twin Turbo, and several other
Carreras, they're a wonderful tire to use.

Unable to send email to the above address. Hope this reaches you.


We sell virtually every brand of tire and we try to make our prices
unbeatable. Unfortunately, most of the owners of later Carrera that I know
have had similar experiences to yours. One of our club members got 8000 on his
Dunlops and is now trying a set of Bridgestone SO2's that have been heat
cycled. He's had them on for about six month, which includes a couple of
autocrosses and so far he's happy with the wear he's seeing. It's too early to
REALLY say how much improvement in mileage the heat cycling is producing, but
initial indications are good.

I've installed many sets of the SO2's on Carrera. Everyone has loved the
ride/feel of the tire. One couple, the wife picked up the car right after the
tires were installed. she called me two blocks away amazed at the comfort
compared to her original tires. A few days later the husband called to rave
about how the tire stuck to the road...

I will get some prices together for you and email them later today or this
eventing

thanks
