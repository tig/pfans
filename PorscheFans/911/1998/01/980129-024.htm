This is a repost for those who didn't see it the first time..

I'm am trying to document for a customer of mine how early (mileage) the
dual-mass flywheels have failed.  

If anyone has experienced a failure, please e-mail me with the year and
mileage that it occured.  Also, how amny people have converted their
system to an alternative style..

Don:

I have a '90 C2 also.  I bought it two years ago with 17,000 miles and now
have 57,800 miles.  I have always been concerned about the flywheel issue,
but was informed that this problem usually only appears on C2/C4s that are
raced.  I do drivers ed events and have had no clutch (or any other)
problems.  My clutch is as solid as the day I bought it.  I do however have
a "binding or galling" sensation when I depress the clutch at a stop, and
was told that my throwout bearing is in need of lubrication.  This can only
be accomplished by opening the clutch housing (transmission/engine
connection) which wouldn't be prudent until it's time to replace the clutch.
I hope this helps.  ChrisK.
