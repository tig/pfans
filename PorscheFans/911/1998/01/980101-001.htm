Presuming that some of our PorscheFans also have other sport/racing
cars, I would like to get any response to an age old gasoline problem of
mine related to a non catalytic converter, weber aspirated Dino Spyder,
as well as my current 993.  

1.  First, as the Dino was built for leaded gas, is their any
availability of this type of gas in the Southeast? Is it prudent to use
it if available? I presently put one of the leading manufacture lead
substitutes in it, just as a precaution. Is this advisable or a waste of
money?

2. As both the Dino and my 993 are not driven much (about 80 miles a
month on lube runs, and an occasional outing during the summer months) I
have been adding STABIL to the gas. Is this a good practice, or are
there better alternatives?

Thanks for all responses.  Steve Hubbard, Charleston SC

 I have a 69 911S and have use 205/60s on the original 15x6 Fuchs (pn
901xxxxxx) for more than 5 years.  The cars ride height has gone form concern
about ground hogs to 4.5 inch clearance.  I have not ever had problem with
tire rub.  However, I have been using moderate proformance tires (H or V
rated) not the latest model.

  I would not be concerned about tire rub.
