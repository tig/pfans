Robert,

I had the same sort of thing with my 72S a few years back.  At an 
autocross (300 miles from home - yikes!) the pulley came loose, broke 
itself and shredded the fanbelt.

After relying on the kindness of strangers and getting safely home, the 
same thing happened in the driveway a few days later, although the end 
result wasn't as disastrous.

What I found was that the mounting flange had an abrasion/nick that 
prevented the pulley half from accurately seating when torqued down.  
Essentially (although not easily visible to the naked eye, the pulley was 
"cocked" ever so slightly, leading to imbalance and ultimately, 
vibration.

You can do te job yourself.  Yes, use Loctite blue (to allow future 
disassembly).  Also clean off the mounting flange with some fine emory 
cloth.  When you torque down the bolt, turn the crankshaft several times 
in the torquing process, to ensure the outer pulley half is mating flat 
and true against the end of the crankshaft.

I have never heard of the problem your wrench is describing, although 
anything is possible, I guess.

If it were me, would definitely NOT pay $500 for this job.
