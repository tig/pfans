Someone once told me that the only year that color was availabe was in '87.
 (He was also the guy who was trying to sell me a '87 911 Coupe - Cassis Red.)
 But, there's a Porsche ad ("There are no old Porsches.  Only new owners.")
that has appeared in a few magazines, that has a picture of an '88 Targa that
I'm pretty sure is Cassis Red (hard to tell, b/c of the lighting in the
picture).

So, my guess is it was available in at least '87 and '88.  Sorry - that wasn't
much of an answer, but maybe it helps...
