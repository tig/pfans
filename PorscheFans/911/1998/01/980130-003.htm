>Has anyone tried the "Club Sport" motor mounts, as sold by Vasek Polak?
Bob,
I have the "club sport" motor mounts in my car. These mount are made of a
harder rubber that the factory mounts and are supposed to reduce some of the
laterial rotational movement you get from high G turns. This should help a
bit in cornering.
I noticed very little additional enging noice or vibration when I orginally
installed these replacing my factory mounts. These were originally put in
during an engine change to replace the worn out original ones that were in
the car.
When I PCA raced this car, I replaced the trans and motor mounts with solid
mounts which need less to say, stopped any movement of the engine. I also
lowered the enging a bit to get the CG a bit lower. These solid mounts are
the way to go in a racing application, but on the street, add to much engine
and trans vibration and noises to the cockpit.
I am not sure that you will get that much out of the "club sport" motor
mounts, unless yours are old and the rubber is worn out.
Terry
