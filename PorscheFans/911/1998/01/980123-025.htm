Various list members have been puzzled by the question of why a wider
tire, which spreads the car's weight over a larger area, produces more
grip.  Others have tried to explain this.  Empirically we, as race fans
when we can't do it ourselves, know that no race car designer is going
to put wider tires which 1) have more rolling resistance, so go slower, 2)
have more wind resistance, so go slower, 3) cost more, and 4) other
considerations you know and I haven't thought of, unless there is
something to be gained in the no BS world after the green flag drops. 
The conclusion is that for high powered cars, more traction is achieved
and the rear wheels don't break loose.  Maybe cornering power is
increased also.  I am not the one to explain why this is so, but there is a
good place to look.

Go to the Central Pennsylvania Region's web site  (via PCA.ORG), click
on the technical section, and go to the Physics of Racing.  This is written
by  physicist/racer Brian Beckman for racers and for the technically
inclined as well, and is fun to read, even for a non-physicist.  I can't
speak for the physicist/engineer types, but I think they will find it
especially helpful, as it has formulae and references to Newton and
other luminaries.  Part II, "Keeping your Tires Stuck to the Ground," is a
good place to start.  

Nordstern has a link to this article at some site Beckman once appended
it, but the link doesn't work anymore, at least not for me.  Central Pa has
the text right on their site. 

Beckman answers lots of questions.  For instance, if grip increases with
weight, why do we care about weight transfer?  Answer:  the
grip/weight relationship isn't linear, so you lose more grip from the lighter
tire than you gain from the heavier tire.
