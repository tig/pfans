Porsche Fans,
    I drove up from San Diego to Los Angeles this past weekend to check
out the new  996 and have mixed feelings at what I saw.
______________________________
I was there as well, and I agree.

 Seeing all of the factory race cars was a real treat. I hate to say it but
that was more exciting than seeing the next generation of the 911. Don't
get me wrong, the car looks nice, but that was about it. To me it did not
have the same "drooling at the mouth" feeling I got when I first got a
chance to see the 993 twin turbo a few years ago.
______________________________
My wife said the same thing.  She knows I'm contemplating getting a 996
Cabriolet when it comes out (unclear when that will be, unless someone
has some info I don't), and she was underwhelmed by the 996, aside
from the ridiculous example they had at the show with a green leather
and wood interior.  They have removed a lot of the aggressive look of
the car that had evolved so nicely, culminating with the wonderful 993
C2 and C4 S.  My wife thought it was boring, and didn't look like a sports
car any more.  I wouldn't agree with that, but agree that it will take some
getting used to.  However, I am conscious of all of the past quotes from
every time a new 911 model is introduced.  Within a few years,
everyone universally agrees that the current 911 iteration is the best
ever.  I'm just going to bide my time and wait for the Cabrio to come out,
to get a look in person.


 The Boxters looked great and the rest of the Porsche display was done
really well.  
    As a side note, if the crowd size at the new Volkswagen Beetle
display indicates the amount of "bugs" they are going to sell, they will sell
millions of them.:)
______________________________
Unbelievable!  The Show was well attended, but even at the Porsche
exhibit, there was little problem moving around and getting to see what
you wanted.  The Beetle exhibit was mobbed - hard to even pass
through the throngs of people. 


Overall I thought the show was great and look forward to getting a
closer look at the 996 when it arrives in the dealerships in a few months.
_______________________________
I enjoyed the show also, and I think the car I enjoyed the most was the
Chrysler Phaeton Concept Car - what a nifty piece of work!
