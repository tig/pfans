I have 205/55-15 BFG T/A's on 6X15 wheels for street use, and there is
very little rubbing inside the wheel wells.  It doesn't seem to rub as
long as I don't use full lock in parking lots.

For track use I have 225/50-15 BFG R1's on 6X15's in the front and on
7X15's (R offset) in the rear.  Again, as long as I avoid full lock
there does not seem to be any rubbing.

I have a short shift kit in my 1971 911S and it worked fine.  No
noticeable change in effort required and it shortened the throw
significantly.  I don't think it significantly shortened the time it
takes to properly complete the shift, but it is much more comfortable
now.

Subject: tire size and short shift

Just a couple of questions:
	1) what is the widest tire anyone has used successfully with the
factory
6x15 fuchs on pre-72 cars, and
	2) has anyone used a short shift kit on a 901 trans? i know it works
great
on the 915 and G-50 units but haven't seen or heard anything about the
901.

thanks in advance for any input in these areas.
