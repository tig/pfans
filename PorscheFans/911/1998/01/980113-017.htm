michael:

i believe you're talking about the booklet by ray scruggs.  i've known 
ray for a few years, and he's a genuinely nice guy, not in any way out to 
fleece people.  the booklet is quite good, the instructions are very 
detailed, and i'm quite sure you could achieve a very satisfactory 
alignment going through the procedure.

however, the procedure looks to be outrageously tedious.  you can do an 
alignment two ways: have a shop with several thousand dollars of 
specialized alignment gear, and whip thru the procedure; or use home 
tools (plumb lines, string, levels, measuring devices, calculation, and 
lots of repetition), and spend all bloody day.  the process requires a 
lot of care and exacting work, which i'm not very good at.  i looked it 
over, and decided i'd be happier paying someone else to do it right.

otoh, i have a much better knowledge of alignment, and the booklet was a 
great help when i lowered the car and put in new rear bushings.  if you 
have any intention of working on your own suspension, you should own 
ray's booklet.  it will save you a lot of ugly guesswork.
