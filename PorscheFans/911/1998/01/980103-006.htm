Subject: Engine ID 



   Sorry if this is a repeat, have had some problems with list. I`ve got

a `77 911 that I picked up from a GSA auction. The car has  a non-stock

turbo motor that appears to me to be of `78-79 vintage.  The engine has

the serial #  6281532 and 930/04 type. My only reference source (Bruce

Anderson`s Performance Handbook) shows this as a `78-`79 3.0L normally

aspirated SC motor. If this is correct, why the "930" part #?  If this

is indeed a non-turbo motor, what problems might I be in for?  I assume

some parts were upgraded in the turbo motors. I would imagine the

pistons at very least would have needed to have been changed to lower

the compression ratio.  I checked the compression while I was trying to

get it running (bad fuel pumps from sitting way to long in impound) and

found all cylinders to be around 110 to 120 pounds. Is this normal for a

turbo?  The turbo setup appears to be OEM (intercooler, turbo, exhaust,

boost gauge in tach etc.)  

so I wonder if this was pirated from yet another  3.3L car.  Are there

any external clues to tell displacement?  Am I going to be better off

tearing it down to see what I have?

Joe:
The 3.0 liter engines as well as the 3.3 liter engines all carry a "930/xx"
type designation. The serial number indicates your engine (case) is a '78.
  Hopefully, the builder of the engine in question modified it internally
before installing all the turbo goodies.  However, the mods (or not) are all
internal to the engine which would allow you to determine compression ratio.
 You could probably get an estimate of the stroke of the crank by going
through the spark plug hole, but with the engine in the car you would end up
with a pretty crude measurement.  I think the difference in stroke is about 4
mm from the 3.0 liter to the 3.3 liter.  From having dissassembled quite a
few 911 engines, I can relate many surprises I have found inside, obviously
not the way they were assembled at the factory:  case mods, larger
pistons/cylinders, etc., so don't assume the case number designation will
determine what's inside.  

 A bore scope might allow you to see the flatness of the piston; looking
through the sparkplug hole, you could see the difference in the stock 3.0 CIS
piston dome and the 3.3 turbo piston dome.  Mods as to cylinder diameter or
to the head's combustion chamber would be almost impossible to determine
without a teardown.  The cylinder cooling fins are quite different on the
turbo; if you remove the cooling fan you could peer inside the cooling shroud
with a flashlight.  The absence of fins on the top of the cylinder would
indicate the turbo P/C.

Hope some of this helps,
