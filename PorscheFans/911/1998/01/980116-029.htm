Hi Wayne,

I re-cap Your '87 911 story;

>- You got a leak in the T- fuel line on top of engine
>- New one is 478,-USD
>- No luck with hydraulic hose repair shops

Wayne's complete message was on 911 list Jan 15th. -98.

- I had same problem on my -85, mine was not leaking, but I checked =

  the hoses while changing intake manifold gaskets and decide to
  do something. =

- No need to drop engine, easy if intake manifold is off. =

  This is not a bad thing, after this You can be sure that those gaskets =
do
  not leak. =

- Not difficult, most time consuming is (was for me, as the gasket was =

  baked really good) to get all old gasket off cyl. heads.
- The hoses can be disconnected at left (driver) side corner of engine,
  there where the hose from fuel filter go.
- A hydraulic hose repair shop fixed all my fuel hoses, obiously I was
lucky,
  the guy asked what I want, went back, cut the old hoses off. Got some =

  new hose with sleeves and came and asked  how I want the end turned.
  He then clamped the sleeves, BUT mentioned that as the stuff is metric,=

  but his hose and sleeves are in inches, he had to clamp them by "feel".=

  I understood that the machine will make a similar "joint", every time
same
  size & type of hose is clamped. This was in Ft.Lauderdale, Florida.
- No concours stuff, look OK and do not leak. Less than 400,-. =

- Try shops that deal with diesel trucks or a boat engine repair shop.

Check ALL the hoses, also oil hoses that feed camshaft & tensioners.
Personally, if the metal part can be turned relatively easy in the hose,
I do something. =
