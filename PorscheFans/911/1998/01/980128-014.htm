Scott,
I experience the same things with my '87 911 CC.
1.  I suspect the CC control unit is the cause of the surging.  I
    don't think it's a failure.  It simply acts like a poorly
    designed control algorithm.
2.  I had the same drifting problem with my '87 911 CC twice now.
    It is a component failure in the CC control unit, although I
    don't know which one.  However, replacing the unit fixed it.
I had posted this problem and experience to the old Philes list
a couple years ago.  Below are some exerpts from me and a few
of those old PorschePhiles.

Let me know what you find out.  At this point, my CC is failing
totally and I again suspect the CC control unit.  If you open it
up, the electronics are vintage and ugly.  So, I'll be looking
for a repair this time.  Someday, I still want to get a schematic.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
'87 911 Targa
............................................................................

The cruise control in my '87 911 used to bleed off speed by about 0.5
mph/mile.
Unable to trace the problem to any obvious source, I eventually replaced
the CC
brain.  Works great now.
 
I've heard about this same thing from a few other Carrera owners.  The
CC
system may be the same in the 928.  In fact, the CC box has a 928.xxx.
prefix
for the porsche part number stamped on it.
 
The CC brain is VDO manufactured electronics package.  A new one lists
for
$600.  I called around bone yards and found a salvage from Parts Heaven
for
$125.  I wanted to repair the one I have, (I suspect a bad transistor or
something) but I cannot get an electrical schematic.  I also cannot find
anyone who will repair VDO electronics.

..........................................................................
I culled these addresses from various pubs. Being new to P'philes, I
hope I
haven't committed a "been there, done that" faux pas. Each of the
following
advertise rebuilt VDO Cruise control amplifiers @ about $130:
AMR
1284 Waspanee CT
Charleston, SC 29407
803-766-0852
 
Beckman Technologies
5714 Nob Hill Rd.
Durham, NC 27704
800-742-1021
 
OEM Parts Dist.
800-260-7278

...........................................................................
This evening I spoke with George Murphy, a contributor to The Star
magazine 
(MBCA) who has a sideline remanufacturing a variety of VDO products, and
he 
*believes* that the cruise control amplifiers used by M-B, Porsche, BMW
and 
a number of other auto manufacturers are the same.  You will want to
talk to 
him -- preferably with the VDO part number off of your unit in hand -- 
before sending it in.  His address(es) and phone number are:
 
     George Murphy
     Performance Analysis Co.
     1345 Oak Ridge Turnpike
     Suite 258
     Oak Ridge, TN  37830
 
     615/482-7260   ** 5 - 9 p.m. eastern **
On the phone he said that a system that will accellerate but not hold 
definitely has a failed amplifier.  His prices for remanufactured units
vary 
by type but are probably between $99 and $150 with core.
