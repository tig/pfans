Morning friends,

I really need help this time.... Last night I drove the 911 back from
the movies to home, at a fairly brisk pace, all was cool, and parked it
in my garage next to the Ghia... Then, as an afterthought, I then
decided to swap the car's positions in the garage for convenience,
climbed right back into the porsche, turned the key, and...nothing !
Okay, oil pressure light etc do work, but nothing happens when the
ignition in theory actually cranks the engine, not even a whisper,
nothing... With a smile on my face, I thought, "no big deal, it's the
classic 911-won't-start-warm routine"... Nope. This morning, same
punishment, no ignition whatsoever... All the battery stuff is
operating, just no cranking...My problem is twofold : One, the car is
home and in that position, it's impossible to push start it without the
help of 12 friends and a mule...  Two, I was supposed to have my
emergency car (the ghia) in the shop this week for much needed brakes
overhaul. So I need the porsche fast ! 

Please, oh wise ones, do suggest diagnostics (if necessary) and
solutions as quickly as possible, so that I can go buy the necessary
parts at lunch and hopefully be back on the road tomorrow !  Any
suggestion, explanation for dummy, idea is welcome !  Thanks in advance
!  

Greg. 83 SC (she'll ruin me if I let her !)  

PS: there's an old clifford keypad alarm that supposedly doesn't work,
so I doubt it would have sprung back to life and killed my
ignition...but I wanted you wizards to  have all the facts just in
case...
