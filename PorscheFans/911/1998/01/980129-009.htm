Hi Gary
No, I'm not still promoting my car ;)  but having some experience with this
model I thought I'd give my $0.02.

Sort of.  You might say "the owner's perception of value" which can
be ridiculous, as you seem to have discovered.  Of course there is
some variation in price in different parts of the country, but the
market for SCs is pretty strong and you should see similar value
across the board for similar cars.

This stuff is worrisome.  Mileage is good, but if the tensioners haven't
been replaced (even with the old-style) they're overdue.  The old
tensioners are good for 60-80k.  Off-brand tires bother me because it
points to an owner who maybe can't afford to maintain the car properly.
The same can be said for having the original shocks.  I mean, c'mon!
Vinyl is, well, vinyl.  Rust bubbles -- *very bad*.  You SHOULD NOT
see rust on an SC.  They were fully galvanized at the factory.  If
this one has rusted, RUN AWAY!  It has been in an accident and was
repaired with non-factory panels.  The poor paint also points in this
direction.  Seems to be some misc electrical problems too, and an
iffy interior.

Here's a tip to see if a car has been in an accident.  Run your fingers
under the fender lip.  You should feel a "pebbly" surface.  That's the
factory stoneguard which you only find on factory panels.  Replacement
panels won't have it and will be smooth to the touch.

A note on engine performance.  This particular model came with a quoted
180hp, while weighing around 2800lbs.  Actual hp varies a bit.  This
will never deliver "neck-snapping" acceleration (by my definition :)
but should be strong, and just wait til you get to the twisties!  It
really handles well.  The Carreras (post-84) came with 217hp and perform
a little better.  Incidentally, It's fairly easy to add 20-25hp to an
SC with an exhaust change -- believe it or not!

Bottom line:  I wouldn't give more than about $7500 for this car.  It has
some potential problems and looks like it's been abused.  Well, maybe
abused is too harsh -- just not well cared for.  Actually, I wouldn't
buy this car at all.  Keep looking and you'll find a good one for the
right price.  I know I did.

Good Luck
Mark
