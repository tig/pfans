   Hi,

    I was looking at the silver 993 on Einmalig's web page under
E-Ticket
Ride, this is exactly what I was looking for, not too much alteration of

the original 993 look (see #45 issue of 911 & Porsche World, pg 54, this
looks like the same car with different wheels). I have a 97 993 (Red)
with the 17" Cup wheels as does your silver 993 mentioned above.  This
looks like they added the 3.6 RS Wing and had the car lowered. Could
anyone recommend (BW Motorsports, AIR, Better Bodies, M.A. Shaw) a
source for the wing, I understand that there is some difference in
quality and finish on these glass wings and don't want to install an
inferior quality wing or have to do a lot of rework to get the fit
correctly. I realize I'll need to get the wing prepped, primed and
painted, and have made arrangements for such. Also has anyone had any
experience with Chrome Cup wheels, who does this and how much does it
cost. Do they look good or is it just too much for the car.

    Thanks for your help,

    Mike Wyatt
