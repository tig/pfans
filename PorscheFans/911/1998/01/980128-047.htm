>Hello all. Does anyone have any direct experience with any of the major

Mike,
    I've been to the Skip Barber school at Road Atlanta.  I took the 3
day competition course and really had a blast.

high points:
	school is run in a very professional manner.
	you drive Skip's cars, not your own.
	there are no charges for any damages to the car
	almost all aspects of racing are discussed
	Road Atlanta is a tremendous track
	Skip Barber offers a way to continue racing after you have completed
the school.

low points:
	the average experence level for the students is very low. This makes
the instructors teach to the lowest level.

DO IT!!
