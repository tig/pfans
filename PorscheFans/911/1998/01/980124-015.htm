I'd like to thank everyone for the help I've received off of 
this list so far.  However, I have a few questions I'd like 
to ask...Sorry if these are being rehashed for the 80th time.

1)  I will be replacing the valve cover gaskets (all four) 
and nuts/washers.  I've never installed a gasket and would 
like to know if there is any special treatment I should give 
them, or just keep 'em clean and stick them on.  I guess I'm 
curious if I should put a light coat of oil on them first or 
add a sealant, or is okay to just stick them on there plain?

2)  Anyone have any luck with that Weltmeister short shift 
kit?  With the Automotion sale flyer I got yesterday, the 
price seems right.  BTW, what's the difference between the 
factory and Weltmeister short shift kits besides $40? I'd 
heard that the new shifter kit comes with new shifter 
bushings.  Is that true?  If so is it just the front 
bushing(s) or the rear also.  If I add this kit, will I goof 
up the linkage adjustments?  I'm getting all those kinks 
worked out now, while I have the car in for transmission 
work, and don't want to screw it up as soon as I get it back.

3)  I like the look of the 87-89(years?) headlights (bigger)  
Are these H-4s?  What should I expect to do to change to that 
style?  What parts (incl. costs) are involved in the 
switchover?  I know H-4s have been discussed, but I'm still a 
little foggy on what is involved in a switchover.

4)  I've seen references to Alpine White and Grand Prix White 
for Porsche colors.  Is that just nomenclature, or is there 
such a thing as two different colors of white?

Thank You,
Chris Jares
