Pat:

What could POSSIBLY have possessed you to scan the tech-tip and send 
it to the list?

That scanned image is 100,000 bytes long -- enough space for about 50
uncompressed typewritten pages, or many HUNDREDS of compressed pages
of text -- yet it's a picture of just three or four sentences which
duplicate what you already SAID in the text of your message.

Please don't ever do that again.

Heart O' Dixie Region of Porsche Club of America Announces 6th Annual Dixie-
Tech!

This year we've expanded Dixie-Tech from a one day event to a day-and-a-half,
and have 4 members of the PCA Technical Committee as speakers!!  We've also
been lucky enough to get Davy Jones, winner at LeMans in 1996, to come speak
to us!

For those who have not attended Dixie-Tech in the past, the event is held in a
club members huge shop, so speakers and attendees can get "hands on".

Huntsville is in northern Alabama, about 90 minutes from Nashville and the
same from Birmingham.  It is a high tech area, with NASA (including NASA's
Space and Rocket Center), and the Army's Aviation and Missile Command at
Restone Arsenal.  For those famialy members who will be coming, but not
attending, Huntsville offers several malls, a historical district, the Space
and Rocket Center (a must see!), and other areas of interest.

Information and a registration form are below.  Y'all come on down!
