Keith,

I had the same problem with my 924 with CIS, it turned out to be the fuel
check value.  I'm including some messages from the 924 list for more info.

Robb...

Have a hot/cold fuel pressure check done. My 79 924 did the same thing. =
On mine it turned out to be a leaking fuel line check valve. This valve =
is integral to the fuel pump, and maintains pressure in the fuel lines =
long enough for a hot engine to cool off, thus preventing vapor-lock. =
New fuel pumps are expensive, I repaired mine by adding an all metal =
metric threaded check valve, available from an industrial plumbing =
supply house. Look for ratings that are compatible with the fuel =
pressures listed in the Haynes manual. I believe that Haynes describes =
the test for hot/cold start fuel pressure, as well as how to test the =
check valve/fuel pump. You might look in a junkyard for an Audi of =
similar year for a fuel pump. On a 79 924, they're the same, not sure =
about an 82. Also Auto Atlanta specializes in 924 parts, new/used. While =
I had good experiences with them several years ago, they seem to have =
bigger and busier and my last encounter with them was less than =
flattering.


  About a month ago, I had been polling "the collective" to try and figure 
out why my 87' 944NA was being a real pill with hot starts. I would like to 
thank EVERYONE for their input. The cause would still be a mystery today 
without the collective knowledge this environment provides!! 
  Well, the DME relay was the problem!! I pulled it apart, and found a 
hairline solder joint fracture on the printed circuit board inside the
relay.
 After reflowing this connection, and the others for good measure, the car 
starts perfectly hot or cold. It has been a month since the fix, and no 
signs of the problem returning!! THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE & HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!


A internal combustion engine needs two things - air & fuel.  Next time you
engine will not start, bring and extra spark plug, attach it to one of the
plug wires and ground the sides/threads of  the plug.  You could also buy
a test plug with one of those aligator clips attatched to the thread area
a test plug I think they are called?  See while cranking if there is
spark. If
so move on to check the fuel side. You will need a fuel pressure gauge,
attatch it on the end (oil filter end/side) of the fuel rail there is a
fitting that the gauge can be hooked up to. The regulator is near the fire
wall on the other end of the fuel rail.  I suspect that the fuel pressure
regulator is sticking - cuasing an overly rich condition. If you have a
freind with the same car you could swap fuel pressure regulators. Also
check
the 10 mm  bolts that hold down the inductive pick up sensors above the
flywheel - sometimes they loosen up causing strange things to happen. 



Original problem:

I am having a problem with my 1973 911T with CIS injection. 

The car starts fine when it is cold or when I just shut it down.  The
difficulty comes when the car has sat for about 1/2 to 2 hours and I try to
restart it.  I did not use to have this problem, but it has steadly gotten
worse over the last six months.  Now when I start my car when it is warm it
is not uncommon for it to take 6-10 trys.  When I try to start the car it
sounds like it is trying, the engine may turn over 5 times itself before it
dies. I have tried every combination of the gas pedal and hand trottle that
I can think of.  When I finally do get it started, it acts like I have
flooded it and sputters for a while until the extra gas is cleaned out,
then it runs fine.

To start the engine when it is cold, I merely pull up on the hand trottle
(no pedal) and turn it over, it usually starts on the first try and always
by the second.

I would appreciate any suggestions which you all may be able to give me,
thank you.

Keith
