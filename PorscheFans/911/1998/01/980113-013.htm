Mike,
  I believe that you are correct that they are the same tensioners.  I
bought these many years ago I believe from Mr. Hoeptner himself when he was
advertising in Pano.  I have not received any replys and was wondering why
no one has commented on this product.
Regards,
Mark

Tom asked :

>> 1)  Before starting this cleaning job the idle on my car was high, about
1500
RPM. Adjusting the airscrews had no effect. ( the car is a 2.4 MFI). I
proceded to dismantle the air stacks and throttle bodies.( under the air
stacks) and noticed alot of carbon build up.  One thing to note was that the
vacume advance lines in the throttle bodies were pluged with carbon. I cleaned
every thing and reassembled it all.  THe problem is that now the idle is even
higher.  I have the air screws in all the way and it idles at 1500 when warm.
Correct me if I'm wrong but,  I would think that with the air screws all the
way in the engine would not run. would the vacume advance being pluged have
any thing to do with it?  <<

Check the timing at idle to see if the vaccuum retard is working.
It's not vaccuum advance on a 911. IF working, when you pull
off the hose the timing should advance something like 10 degrees
immediately and the revs go up. If this is not working check
if you have some vaccuum out of the line at the distributor.
It is not much but noticeable. Also check operation of the
distributor, you can do it with the engine off by sucking
on a hose attached to the distributor and watch the
plate turn.

But actually your problem could be vaccuum leaks in the
throttle bodies. You can test for them by letting the
engine idle and spraying some carb cleaner (or something
else that I've forgotten that kills the engine) around
the base of each stack. When the RPMs change you have
found the leak.

Those air screws don't do a whole lot on my engine
but I have old throttle bodies. But you should clean those
passages with carb cleaner and pipe cleaners until
clean. Some will probably be clogged.

Good luck!

Hi,

If you have a pair or four 245/50/15 BFG R1s in decent
shape that you don't need let me know. Want some rear tires
for early season testing and setup (I have 4 225/50/15s
for the front from my S).
