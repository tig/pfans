Good reasons to buy an '87.

This sounds very good.

This is where my car is now. I really need to have some work done on it
(new plug wires, valve adjust, etc.) but it runs, daily, like a champ. I
really feel that the 87-88-89 were the last of the "bullet-proof" Carreras
and the end of the "classic" 911 era.

Ouch and yay! I bought mine 1.5 years ago with 66K miles for $19.5K. The
dealer is getting his due, will he give you some sort of warranty for that
price? Also, yours sounds cherry from the description and mine was a bit
rough.

You should ask for a mechanics inspection, including leakdowns, and the
results in writing.

No problem with the chain guards. The G50 has some potential problems. The
first ones out the door had a problem with the clutch actuator that
required  machining on the housing to fix--might examine the records to see
if this was done. Also, the "rubber centered clutch" issue.

Your biggest problem will be smog inspections--not just because it is a
911, but because you live in CA ;-)

Call the PCNA, they can provide some data on the car's history.

I understand completely.
