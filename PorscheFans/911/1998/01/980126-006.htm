First thanks for the help on removing the glass in the side mirrors.  I
have successfully completed the task of swapping the two mirrors.  I plan
to put convex glass on the passenger side mirror.  I was wondering if
anyone has tried the aspherical mirrors that were described in a letter in
the last issue of Excellent &that are advertised in several of the Porsche
catelogs??

As I mentioned last week, my 911 goes to the body shop for a complete paint
job on Tuesday.  It is a '77 911S with a 3.2 engine.  I was just looking
for anything I should tell the bodyman to be looking for - or any minor
upgrades that could/should be done while the car is in a stripped down
state.

The shop I am using does a lot of Porsches - but it never hurts to plan ahead.

Thansk in advance!

John
