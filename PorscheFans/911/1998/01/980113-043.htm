Hello,

I recently purchased a  1980 911 SC.  I get plenty of warm air when I
engage the front windshield defrosters (by pulling up the levers near
the handbrake), however, when I do this I can smell what I think is
burning oil.  It is barely noticeable mind you.  Prior to purchasing the
car I had a buyer's inspection done by a good mechanic.  He did not
indicate that there was anything wrong with the heater boxes or exhaust
system.  The only problem is that there is no power at the engine heater
fan unit.
One of the oil return tubes does leak slightly but not enough to leave
any oil on the garage floor.  This may be where the burning oil smell
comes from.  But why would I smell the oil inside the car only when I
engage the defrost?  Could this be a sign of damaged heater boxes
(potentially hazardous to my health) or does the warm air typically have
an "engine-compartment-like-odor" to it?  I only notice this problem
when I use the defroster.  I don't notice anything when I turn on the
interior heater, although no warm air comes out from the heater vents
since the heater fan is not working.

Thanks for the help,
