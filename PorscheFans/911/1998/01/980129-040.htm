    Your only error, Dirk, was in assuming that I'd FIND any errors.

    Similarly, I don't think the "good parts" need any expansion;
    you described the procedure more completely than I would have.

    And as for the "excellent points I'll wish I'd known"... I can
    only think of the following, both of which I'm sure you ALREADY
    know:

    1.  After going through the entire procedure and eventually
        removing the stuck bolt, you can avoid the necessity for a
        repeat performance NEXT year by liberally coating the bolt
        (or its new replacement) with anti-seize before re-installing
        it.  Coat the threads AND the underside of the bolt-head. 

    2.  If the bolt's stuck not because it's galled or rusty or
        whatever, but because it's been glued in place with one of
        the high-strength Loctites, you can usually free it VERY
        quickly with this method:

            a.  Heat the bolt-head red-hot with a torch (use the
                smallest tip you have).

            b.  LET THE BOLT COOL.

            c.  Tap it with a hammer.
