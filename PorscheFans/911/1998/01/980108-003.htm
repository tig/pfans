I've been reading  the thread on unleaded fuel with some interest.    For 
six years I had a '68 911 starting in 1974 when you could still get good 
leaded fuel.   However my mechanic (Franz Blam) told me to use Amoco premium 
back then when it was it was the only premium unleaded gasoline.   Car 
always ran great and plugs were always in good shape.    Only reason I got 
rid of the car was rust.

I think the lead problem is overstated for whatever that is worth.
