We've seen a couple here in the Seattle area where the tie rod connection to
the end of the steering rack fails causing strange handling problems. The
connection doesn't come completely apart, but allows a lot of play. I even
replaced both sides of a car with no apparent problem at 25,000 miles before
is was shipped to Europe for driving on 8 tracks. Our group had at least one
spare along just in case. These pieces are easy to replace by not changing
the whole tie rod, just the cylindrical piece on the inner end. If you pay
attention to the original position of the tie rod adjustment you can get the
toe back fairly closely to the original position, but you should get the toe
checked just in case. Also, make sure you take any twisting out of the
rubber boot that covers the joint (a little patience is needed to get it
back on) to prevent it from snagging and tearing.
