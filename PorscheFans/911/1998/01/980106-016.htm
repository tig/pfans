Herve - the regulator on your 82 SC is part of the alternator itself,
although it can be removed and replaced separately.  It has the brushes
attached to it, so they get replaced at same time.  These are solid state
devices, and generally either work fine, or fail completely.  I believe
failure mode is to generate no current at all (which is much safer than
putting out high voltages and frying things).  In any event, they don't
gradually change the way the old coil and contact regulators could as
contacts pitted and springs weakened.  And they can't be adjusted,
tweaked, repaired, refurbished, etc.  When they quit working properly,
they get tossed.

I don't think these are separately tested often.  If your alternator isn't
working, you will get one of the following indications:  a) the idiot light
won't go out after you start engine and rev it to 1000 or so RPM.  b) the
idiot light doesn't come on when you turn on the key before starting the
engine, and never comes on.  b) is a pretty good sign of a packed up
regulator, and has happened to me.  a) could be the regulator or
something in the alternator.

Another test is to measure voltages at the battery.  With ignition off,
battery voltage should be 12.0-12.6 volts.  With engine on at about 2000
rpm voltage should be 13-14 volts.  If engine on voltage is same as
ignitiion off voltage, your charging system isn't working.  Regulator is a
reasonable place to start looking, although last problem I had was from
the collector brush rings being worn down to the insulation which is
under them.
