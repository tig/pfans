I repost this message hoping someone who might have had similar problem
or fix might not have seen when it was last posted. I've had a battery
draw down problem which I have traced to the in dash
heater AC unit. The small fan located at the back of the unit sometimes
remains on. If the number 1 fuse is pulled, the fan of course stops.
When the fuse is reinserted, depending upon the air temperature, the fan
willb restart or not restart.  (If it is cold the fan stays on. If it is
warm weather the fan will stay off.  Also should the air temperature
turn cold the fan will turn itself  back on) I have had the unit out of
the dash and disconnected the blue and wires which power the small fan.
However I continue to get an electrical draw of  .35 amps as there seems
to be a relay staying closed.  Is there a temperature sensor somewhere
which is staying hot when of course  it should not be powered with the
ignition turned off.  I hope this is not a bad unit as I'm told the
unit, even used, is expensive. I also don't want to buy a unit and find
it's not the unit but instead something in line between the fuse and the
unit itself.
Any ideas?
