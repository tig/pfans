hey,
First of all I appreciate the replys about rotors and fenders. My
decision was made based on everyones advice.
  Now for my next question. Does any one in Florida offer special rates
for investment or collectible autos? I have a 1975 911S that I am
restoring. Right now it is up on blocks and my insurance company wants
almost double my house insurance annually! Even if I never drive it. In
Indiana it was covered under homeowners insurance. So this is quite an
unexpected exspense. somebody help me. Thanks in advance.(I hope.) 

later,
 Shawn

Steve and others:

When people ask about Brand XXX Oil, I ask them to check with their oil
salesman about XXX Oil Company's R&D budget or R&D staff or engine or fleet
tests and then ask them to compare it to those of Mobil, Valvoline, Pennzoil,
Castrol, etc.  I know lots of people swear by it but you know what P.T. Barnum
said about suckers?  Also, make sure they aren't the pyramid salemen or just
reading sales literature.

PS  Some store label brands are actually made/bottled by the big oil companies
and may be ok but often corners are even cut here to stay cost competitive.
Also, as I understand the additive sellers are doing lots of the oil research
these days and helping the oil companies who buy their product.  They cannot
always be trusted, though.
