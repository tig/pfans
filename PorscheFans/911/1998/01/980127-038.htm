Hi Saqib,

1) Currently my SC is missing a rear Sway bar, I plan to have one
installed soon, but want to know how much of a difference this makes in
doing a Driver's Ed.
	I suspect you'll quickly miss that swaybar out on a track.

2) My tires are OK. They have good tread on them, but they are not new,
is it worth it to buy new tires before the event?
	Probably not for your first year's worth of events. It's fine to use what 
you have and learn how your car behaves on street tires. Over time you may 
choose to invest in newer tires or even in special tires and replacement 
wheels (such as the R1 tires) just for the events. But for now, don't sweat 
it. You'll know you need new tires when you wear out the ones you have or 
when their performance begins to impact on your having fun.
	
3) I have standard seat belts, do I need any add-ons. If so, from where?
	Yes! In Chicago you can run at first as a novice with stock belts, but I 
strongly recommend getting a real set of harnesses, 5 or 6 point for both 
you and a passenger/instructor. These can be installed without drilling. I 
got my set from Dave Turner Motorsports, San Diego 800.854.6640. Tell him 
exactly what model/year you have as well as the kind of seat, power, 
leather, sport, etc. You will also need a harness bar to act as a guide for 
the shoulder straps as they pass over your shoulders and attach to the rear 
seat belt anchors. My bar is made by Brey-Krause, 
http://www.enter.net/~breykrause/ who have many distributors around the 
region. Both together can run as much as $500, or about $250 for each.

4) Where do I get a good Helmet for the Driver's Ed?
	There're are many vendors, Bell, Shoei and Simpson among them, and range 
of products and materials. You'll need to set a budget and then actually 
try on some models. You want a proper, tight, fit with comfortable 
visibility. I value my head highly and invested in a Kevlar lightweight 
Bell helmet from Northstar Motorsports. http://www.northstarmotorsports.com 
or (800) 356-2080  in Barrington, IL.  PCA rules will require a recent 
Snell Foundation sticker and I recommend an auto rated helmet, and not a M 
rated motorcycle helmet, since it will serve you as well if you become more 
serious about your racing in the future.
 5) I plan to have my brakes checked and bled before the event.
	Great! Make sure they put in high temperature brake fluid such as ATE 
Super Blue.

6) I have high idle on my SC. Would that make a difference?
	High idle alone shouldn't be problem since you spend little time idling, 
unless it's a sign of some other poor tune that might be exacerbated on the 
track. Which leads to the question of a "tech inspection". See next.

Any other consideration I need to take before I sign up for an event?
	(1) There's a technical inspection sheet that is reviewed by a designated 
club member at the event. You are responsible for preparing your car so 
that all items on the list are in acceptable shape. Get a copy ahead of 
time and go through it yourself or with your shop. If you need a copy just 
email me your FAX number and I'll get one to you. (2) You might try getting 
a book or two on racing technique and reading ahead of time about concepts 
like corner apex, weight transfer and turn radii. Otherwise, come out and 
have fun. The Chicago Region PCA is a great place to learn with lots of 
helpful instructors and a real focus on having a safe good time for all.
