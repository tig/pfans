Hi Walt, 

It's a shame you can't use your Sportomatic.  You have my
commiserations.  

Please send me your email address - I've got a May '79 Sporto 911 SC and
mine is excellent. I just put a new servo unit in it - one of the (new)
superceded ones from the P factory in Germany.  I've got a spare servo
too because they're becoming rare and very expensive parts.  They used
to be $AUD280 then they went up to $AUD420 and now they're $AUD1,250 and
you have to send your old part in and they send you a re-built one and
that all takes 5 weeks.  (What a nightmare!)  

I've got access to some Sporto doco which I can scan and email - it
comes from Porsche Cars in Melbourne who is the Aussie distributor and
the local Porsche dealer here in Darwin has started building a (small)
library of Sporto information because they reckon I'm a good customer. 
ha ha  You should try your local distributor (Porsche Cars North
America?) and ask for some assistance.  It sounds like nobody knows for
sure what's going on and that can happen when a complex problem
manifests itself in a car like a Porsche.  I found Porsche in Melbourne
to be excellent and very willing to help when I phoned about hot air
leaks into the cabin, Sporto problems, backfiring problems and a few
other things.  Unfortunately I haven't found a www.porsche.helpdesk site
yet - be great if there was one.  I guess this forum is the best thing
for 911 information.
