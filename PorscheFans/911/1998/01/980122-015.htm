High School physics taught us that the maximum friction was 
proportional to the force pressing the car down on the surface and 
that by extension, the maximum cornering force was equal to One G. 

Laws of physics tend to stay true. Race cars achieve cornering forces 
well above 1 G due to aerodynamic aids, .. downforce in other words. 
A Formula 1 car in the old days(4 years ago) with a negative 
underbody and no silly pieces of wood, plus big wings, could corner at 
4 G's. Ever notice that F1 drivers have big neck muscles?

The High School physics problem we all studied assumed a co-efficient 
fo friction of 1.0 between the tire and the surface. That's nice in 
theory but it ain't quite so in the real world. We get high cornering 
forces because of cunning underboady designs, spoilers and wings 
which replace lift with negative lift  (i.e. downforce). 

The tires have an important role to play. I think tire engineers
define a skid as the point where a tires slip angle is exceeded.
Unlike the theoretical physics model in High School, a tire has a
certain amount of twist and "give". The internal structure (belts, 
sidewalls and such) do "give" under cornering loads. The twist and 
give create the slip angle. 

Ever notice how your car tracks out of a sweeper
without changing the wheel angle? As you accelerate after the apex
the loads increase somewhat and the tire's slip angle takes you
nicely out to the verge. It isn't a skid, just your rubber twisting.

Consider a car with skinny tires (average rent-a-car) any spirited
cornering and the tires howl like a banshee. That's the tire warning
you that the maximum slip angle is being approached and back off or
you'll skid. Take the same car and equip it with wider wheels and
tires and presto no squeal.

The greater the load on a tire the greater the tendency to twist and 
give. Wider tires ON WIDER RIMS have a lower loading than narrow ones. 
Under most circumstances, wider tires run cooler because of lower 
loadings and permit the car to develop more cornering force without 
exceeding the max slip angle. Like all things in nature, there are 
limits, a tire that is too wide won't do anything but slow the car 
down. Finding the right width is a complex art and most of us do it 
by the seat of our pants. 

Do note that wider tires increase unsprung weight (bad) and drag. On 
a 993 I observed that 235 fronts cost me about 6 MPH top speed on the 
back straight.  Like everything else in life, it's a compromise.  Do 
note that wider rubber on the same size rim usually won't produce 
better results. If the sidewall is bulging out from the rim, the 
contact patch of the wider tire will be pretty much the same as a 
narrower tire. For example, a 205 50 17 on a 7.5 inch 993 rim and a 
235 40 17 on the same rim have almost the same contact patch.

ON MORE TIME... most of the hotels in Monterey and surrounding areas are SOLD
OUT!!!!..  This has been the case since last August, A lot of the Orange Coast
Region PCA members are staying at the Motel 6 in Marina California..It is sold
out too. I Faxed the MBR (monterey bay region) order form to Dave Buhain
already, as usual we are having a caravan going up the coast on Friday the
14th of August,,,all are welcome to join us...we will be leaving from Orange
county around 8am...
for lodging call......Room Finders @ 800-847-8066 or 800-757-5646
Buy your tickets to the races at the gate..
