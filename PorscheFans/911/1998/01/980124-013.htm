Hi gang, has anyone try this product?  Automobile (2/98) mag mentioned
the product briefly.  The below paragraph was taken from the seller web 
site: http://www.americaninnovators.com

"
We would like to introduce you to an exciting new automotive product: 
The PF-72000, Flash Photo Deflector Fluid. This amazing new fluid will 
prevent flash photographs of a vehicle license plate. The PF-72000 is 
simply sprayed on the license plate of any vehicle. When a treated plate 
is hit by a camera flash, the light is enhanced and reflected back, 
leaving a whited out image in the developed picture (see figure 1 and 2). 
"


It costs $40 for an 8oz bottle.  The plate need to be sprayed every 1.5
weeks assume no heavy rain or car wash.

If anyone has tried this before, please let us know if the product
works as claimed.  If I haven't heard from anyone, I guess I'll be the
first sucker and report back ;-).

- Nguyen Nguyen
