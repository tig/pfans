Hi Juha,

Some answers (opinions?)


A. Chain wheel wear is odd. Idler wheels wear on outside and

    cam wheels on inside. This looking from pulley end of engine.

    Chain wheel mis-alignement?

Yes, I'd say so.


B. How to determine if chains worn, these has been changed as

    they are split type.

    Should I change them anyhow?

Considering the wear on the idler and cam wheels, I'd change them.


F. Piston pin lock rings.

    Should these be replaced or can they be re-used?

I reuse them, but I bet the purists replace them.  For what it's worth,
they do not come as a standard part in a full engine gasket kit, which
would imply that they need not be replaced.


G. Piston ring end gaps 1st 0,55, 2nd 050, 3rd 0,60.

    Side clearance OK.

    Engine leakdown around 5%, except leaking #6.

    Should rings anyhow be changed?

I am in the process of rebuilding a 2.4T engine, and found the same sort
of thing.  Excellent leakdown, not obvious problem with the end-gap.  I
wasn't going the replace the rings until I measured the width of the old
rings vs, the width of new ones.  They **were** worn.  I'm replacing mine.


I. Valve guides has to be replaced, but valve stems do not

   show any major wear, I have to measure them, this is visual.

   Should valves be replaced anyhow?

   Should valve locks be replaced also?

   Should retainers be replaced also?

You really need to measure the valve stems to detect any wear.  A visual
inspection won't do.  I'm not sure what you mean by 'locks' and
'retainers.'  I think there is only one locking device, the two collet
halves.  I've never replaced them.



   (In our race car we always replace locks & retainers together,

   but spring pressures & rpm is much higher.)

J. I had no plan to split the case.

   Should I open one CR to check the bearing?

How can you open one CR (crank rod?) without splitting the case?  I never
thought about it, but is it possible to do it through the cylinder spigots?
I'll have to look tonight.  In any event, I don't think just looking at one
will help.  On the last engine I did, all the rod bearings looked great
except for one, which had spun.

Hope this helps.

Where are you in Finland?
