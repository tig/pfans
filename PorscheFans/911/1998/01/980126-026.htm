Hi All,

I'm in the progress of buying a 911SC. I've looked many places over the
last 2 years and finally there is one which lives up to my expectations.
It's a '83 coupe guards red with sport seats, black leather int.,
sunroof, air, factory alarm, 16" fuchs, and fog lights. The condition is
very nice (the finest I've seen in two years search) and it's had the
proper updates like: pop-off valve, carrera tensioners etc. The mileage
is 145.000 km (yes I live in Canada) and the engine idles fairly ok. By
fairly I mean it starts at 1000rpms and when it gets warm it idles a
little erratic 800-1100 rpms. Blipping the throttle brings it back to
900-1000rpms. The engine has never been rebuild and I'm going to get a
leak down check when we check it out at the wrench. What numbers am I
supposed to expect ?? I assume figures around 5-8% ?? How is a leak down
test done ?? I'm asking since some people say the engine must be stone
cold (as when you adjust valves) and some says warm.
Last but not least how do I decode the VIN number?? the number is
WPOAA0919DS122346, I forgot to write down all the option codes but know
how to decode those.

It also needs some small fixes like: replacing a rubber mold on both
driver door windows (it's the part which leans up against the width of
the window on the outside just above the door frame, it looks like it
shrunk in width.). Redying the driver seat because of wear, the foam is
still firm and not flat. There is though a very small hole in the
leather which I will fix at the same time. Re-charge the air con system.
New tires of course, something you always expect when buying a used car.
Rubber moldings around the mirrors needs to be changed since the car had
a repaint done where the rubber moldings where cut. The re-paint was
done by previously owner. The owner (third owner) has it on the 5'th
year and put approx. 55.000 km on it. It's kept in extreme nice shape,
still looks like it just came out of the paint-shop. Very particular
with valve adjustment. Selling because he wants a C2. Suggested price is
25.000 Can$ but we haven't settled on a price yet, want to hear what the
wrench says first.
Please let me know if there is anything I should remember to check for.
BTW: I'm currently using the FAQ check list.

Thanks for all response. Looking forward for the BIG smile.
Michael
