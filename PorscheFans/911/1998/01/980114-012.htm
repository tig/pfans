Hi Porsche Friends...

Due to a recent brake upgrade to my Carrera, I'm offering the complete
braking system for sale. Would be a great bolt on upgrade to earlier cars
70s to SCs. Donor car has 40K miles and has had fluid changed on a regular
basis.

It includes front and rear rotors, front and rear calipers and master
cylinder.  All in excellent condition. $675 + shipping.

Now for my question...

I'm trying to determine if my clutch is nearing its useful life and
I have a few questions. I have an 84 Carrera with 40K miles that sees track
action a number of times a year...

Should the clutch grab close to the floor or near the end of its travel, and
is this an indication of adjustment or wear? 

Is it possible to visually inspect for wear without taking eng/trans out?

I see that there is an aluminum clutch assembly available for the 915 trans.
What are the advantages of going to Al istead of steel?

Thanks!

Lou
