P-fans:

1:  I was looking at the index of Excellence issues and saw something
about putting 930rear susp. parts in an SC.  Anyone done this?

2:  I can find very little info on the SCRS.  As I have an SC I was
thinking about making an SCRS replicar.  Can someone point me in the
right direction to research this possible project?

3:  My steering wheel is a little off rotational center.  Can I just
unscrew it and adjust or do I have to fiddle with the alignment?

4:  Speaking of alignment, in the back of pano or excellence there is a
gent who advertises all you need to know for home alignment with simple
hand tools for $12.  Anyone have/tried this document?  $12 is really
peanuts but I just hate feeling like a sucker....

5:  The PO put a headliner with out the sunroof access and did a crappy
job too boot.  How hard is it to do a headliner and any advice on the
proper techniques?

TIA

-Michael
