Hello all, I got my first 911 last summer, in need of tires.  After
considering my driving style and reality, I settled on Michelin Pilot
XGTVR-4's, using P205/R60x15 front, and P215's on the back.  Last night
I went to Elk Grove, CA from my home in the Sierras in the worst weather
I've been driving in for several years.  At first the dark, fog, heavy
rain and lack of visibility were daunting, however as my confidence in
the "stickyness" of the tires increased, fun was had. (Isn't it great
that Porsche driving is fun ALL the time?) Anyway, the tires worked
GREAT. Only sliding under EXTREME provocation, tracking well through
some hydroplaning (sp?) situations and just generally fun.  I was going
to give information  on how I used the Michelin web site "Tire Sizer",
but when doing so I discovered that the tires sizes for the early 911's
are no longer listed. They may be being discontinued because of the
reduction of demand for 15" tires. If you drive a lot of miles in all
weather conditions, I would highly reccomend this tire, get them while
there are some 15's still out there.  They are quiet and stick well in
the dry, track well in the snow (tried it last weekend) and are
generally great. Had a great time in bad weather last night !
