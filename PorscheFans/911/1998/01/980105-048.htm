Hi all,

I have some data that I can offer you guys, but no definitive answers.

My '97 993 C4S came with 18" Turbo Look Design (TLD) wheels.  These are the 
wheels that look like the Technology wheels, but have solid spokes.  The 
offset of mine are 52mm front and 40mm rear.  The Carrera 4S has the same 
rear "widebody" of the Turbo.  

It was a while after I purschased the car that found that these are different
wheels.  They sure look the same.  See the TLD wheels on the Arena Red
Carrera 4S and the Technology wheels on the Silver TT at:

I think it is now adding up to why the TLD's have a backspacing of 40mm and 
the Technology wheels have a greater backspacing of 60mm.  The smaller the
number, the wider the stance.  Porsche offers the Technology option (#408)
to the "skinnybody" Cab in '98 and the "skinnybody" Coupe in '97 at a 
cool $3229.  These wheels wouldn't fit with a offset of 40mm, so Porsche
has a 60mm offset and for the Turbo, uses a 25mm rear spacer.  No, facts
just guessing.  If anyone can confirm, I would appreciate that.

If my guess is correct, I am quite curious why Porsche would compromise
their flagship Turbo models' unsprung weight by using spacers.  Looking
at the '96 factory manuals, they say that the rear offset is 40mm on the
Turbo.  Maybe things have changed since '96.

If I had to guess, I would say that these are new wheels with new offsets.
The 7.5's are new wheels, so Porsche should do the proper job and build
the correct rear wheel.  Are you sure that they are the "hollow" Technology
wheels and not the less expensive TLD's?  I haven't read enough articles.

I went the other direction.  Like I say, my Carrera came with 18" wheels.
Just today, I installed 17" Forgeline track wheels with Hoosiers
mounted.  After work tonight I attempted to heat cycle the rubber.  I'm
a rookie at this business, so if anyone can offer me advice, I would love
to hear from you.  My approach was to drive it up and down HW280 for about
100 miles.  Now I'll let her rest for a couple of days.

It's not fair to compare the Hooiser's to the road tires that I had on, the
Bridgestone S-02's.  They are intended for different purposes.  A number
of people have told me that going to 17" wheels would increase acceleration
due to a higher wheel RPM, but another one my of guess' is that's not
correct either.  The diameter on the S-02's is 25.2(F)/24.9(R) vs's the
Hoosier's 17" 24.4(F)/25.2(R) and the BFG 17" 25.6(F)/25.6(R).  Another
guess is the increased acceleration is related to rotational mass.  Those
TLD's weigh a ton!  

>Any comments would be appreciated.

That's my 2 cents!
