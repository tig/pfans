In Australia,

996 manual     $183,900
996 Tiptronic	$191,900

First 100 cars available are already sold out, though a bunch are 
being used as dealer demonstrators. Deliveries started on 9th 
January and I've already seen my first one on the street.

I have had what seems like the same problem with my 77 Targa Sportomatic.  
It turned out to be the distrubutor points gap.  When the Distibutor cam gets
hot and expands, the gap closes.  The spark never gets to the engine.   

I hope it is something this simple.  

Good luck, Walt

I also fell for the sportomatic  in a very nice  "looking"  1997 911S.  I got
it in late October 97; had it about three weeks and then sent it to my
favorite Porsche wrench to fix the shifting.  Today is 1-23-1998 and it till
isn't ready to pick up. 

My first mistake was not waiting for the PO  to have it smog checked.  Big
mistake as I had to fork over $1,000 for the missing thermal reactors and rear
view mirror.  Also the tires changed down one size from the time I test drove
the car to pickup.  The trunk carpet also changed from new to old acid eaten.
Moral of the story - never  pick up a car at night.  

The next thing that happened is checking with the dealer that bworked on the
transmission only to find that there was no warranty as the PO had supplied
used parts.  

The "Oh. my! the dealer must have over filled and that is why it is leaking
oil turned into the expected -- there are three places the oil is leaking.   

Then I discovered that the windshile washer does not work.  The rear window
defogger does not work.  The spare tire hold dpown was missing and there is a
square head non-metric bolt holding down (sort of)  the battery.  

The good news is the battery is new, the transmission has over $5,000 in it to
correct the shifting problem that isn't fixed but I have a rebuilt trani.    

The other good news is the high idle @2,500 in neutral has been traced to a
sticking distributor and has been fixed.  The broken oil line that caught fire
during the over two month stay at the dealer won't catch fire on the road.
The car has a new Alpine radio with CD player.  The seats have been recovered.
It has a new  power antena.  The carpet is like new.  The dash is like new and
the car has a realtively and very nice new paint job. The top is new except
some work needs to be done on the wind noise.   

The latest news: yesterday I called to see if they got the distributor fixed
and could I pick the car up.  Good news/bad news.  The distributor works.  Th
engine is normal.  But the Sporto doesn't shift right again.  

 After about 5 weeks of trouble shooting (they only have the shop foreman who
can work on these older cars) they thought it was the Vacumn control valve.
Then two weeks to get a from Bosch the new part didn't fix the problem.  Next
they found a vacumn leak in #5 (I think) which lead to a replaced  seal.  Next
#5 or #6 was flooding.  This involved a new fuel distributor module.  Every
thing rady to go for pick up last wednesday.  We drove the 1.5 hour trip and
found the car all washed and ready to go.  Good news /bad news.  The trani
shifted but the distrubutor was sticking in advance ( not coming back) causing
the engine to idle at 2,500.  As this had happened  to the previous owner (
rad big bucks to fix but not fixed) I was delighted they had found the
problem.  This meant another trip back on Friday of this week -- no problem,
I'm getting my car back.  Right?  Wrong!  "Don't come, the service advisor
said, I tried to run the car today.  The idle problem is fixed, the engine
runs fine and stong but it doen't shift right again."  

So the saga goes on.  

Any ideas out there?  

Symptoms of sportomatic problems
1. The car will shift reliably at about 1,000 rpm ( the sporto idles about
800)   
2. If you shut the ignition off, you can easily shift into the gear of choice
1,2,3,R --  then restart and go.  Very inconvienient at a stop sign though you
can start out in 2nd.  (read here -no aceleration power).  
3. The brakes seem to be somewhat defficient (though it has been a few years
since I had a Porshe, but this one is supose to have vacumn assisted brakes). 
4. If you decelerate and stop very slowly, the problem is less severe.  

Note, I verified the switches on the shift lever are working.  Though I have
not proven that the signal from the relay actually gets to Vacumn Control
valve (read here there may be an intermittend wire at the VCV.  Maybe this
explaians why it works at 1,00 rpm if the engine is torqued and moving the
wires.   

At any rate, I need help
