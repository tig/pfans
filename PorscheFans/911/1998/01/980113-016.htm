Todd S. seems to like these tires for the street.  If you're going to run
race tires on the street I guess they're as good a choice as
any....but...there are a number of good reasons why you may not want to run
them on the street....

1.  They are'nt as puncture resistant as your average street tire
2.  You ain't gonna get 'em hot enough on the street to be able to use
anywhere near their capability. You asked why more rock chips with an
R1.....go to the track and stand in pit lane when cars come off with hot
tires and drive by slowly.....if you listen to the tire passing over
asphalt, it sounds like tearing two pieces of velcro apart....that's the
sticky part that picks up rocks and throws them off when spinning with
increased speed.  You won't get 'em hot enough on the street to do this so
probably won't notice more rock chips....but you never get to use the tire
anywhere near capacity.
3.  They're slippery when cold.
4.  They turn with much more difficulty when going slow (parking, etc.)
5.  They don't wear very well, even though you're not using them to their
capacity.
6.  One sidewall is very stiff so the ride sucks.....
7.  If you do get caught it the rain, I hope you've driven on ice....

I could probably come up with more reasons if I thought more about it.  I've
driven on the street with them on the way to an event....I wouldn't have if
I didn't have to.......
