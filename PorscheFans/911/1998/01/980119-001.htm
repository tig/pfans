Hi Mike:

   Gearing,...a subject very dear to my heart! As you've undoubtedly
figured out, there aren't many "cheap" things to do with your car at
this stage.

Regarding your dilemma about whether to change the Ring & Pinion, if you
are already running the stock transmission, you have the 7:31( 4.43:1)
R&P. That is a performance-oriented final drive ratio especially
considering what Porsche started using in the later cars, 8:31(3.88:1)
R&P. This is already pretty low!

If there was a performance problem, it started when you upgraded to the
larger 17" tires. Your tires, 275/40 x 17 are approximately 25.7" tall
and roll down the road at 812 revs/mile. The previous tire combination,
225/50 x 15 was 23.9" tall and rolled at 881 revs/mile. Since you
already have the 7:31 R&P, the only thing you can do to restore the
original, shorter overall gearing is to change the internals in the
gearbox. :^(

The best advice here would be to install a custom gear stack using the
stock first gear in the interest of economy. There is a 7:33 R&P that is
rare, expensive, and may be hard to find.

For big overall, through-the-range performance increase, changing the
top 4 gears is the most bang for the buck, expecially with the
availability of 915 gears. Since you are considering open-heart surgery
on the transmission anyway, this would be the time to do this!
This is still less expensive than building an RS-spec motor. Plus, if
and when you decide to do so, you will be simply amazed at how fast your
car will become :^))

As usual, our opinions only,

Best Regards,
