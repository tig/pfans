R.W. Bailey, a 914 interloper on our list, asks:

Hey all,

        I have been informed by my mechanic that I need new CV joint(s).  I
hear a noise that only seems to come from the right side of the car.  But
he says that it is possible all four are worn out. With CV joints @ 90$
each, plus labor, this could end up being a seriously expensive bill.  From
reading the past posts, it seems that you can take a worn out CV joint
from the right side of the car, and swap it with one on the the left side of
the car.  About how much mileage do you get out of the swap versus
just replacing? 
        If BOTH sides of the car need new CV's, then it would be
economically smarter to do the swap, than buy new ones, cause you
would have  had to pay the labor to take apart various parts of the drive
train's on BOTH sides.  But, if only ONE side of the car has CV joints that
need to be replaced, would it be more expensive in labor to do the
swap?  Cause there would be all that extra labor to take out the CV joint,
on the other side, that did not need to be replaced.  So basically what I
am saying is, about how long does it take a good mechanic to take out
(one or both) CV's on a given side?  Is it only beneficial to do the swap if
BOTH sides need replacing?

PS: please don't respond saying I should do the work myself myself,
cause I won't!

Dennis - here's the deal.  If a CV is worn out, it is worn out - junk,
useless except (if cleaned) as a paperweight, or a deep sea fishing
sinker.  How do you (your mechanic, in this case) know if it is really
worn out?  You take it off and take it apart, and start cleaning the grease
off of the important parts.  As soon as you find excessive wear you
know it is junk and you need clean no farther. 

What about swapping?  Here's the deal.  There is wear and there is
wear.  The CVs wear more on one "side" of things internally than the
other.  Inside the rascals they wear more on the "drive"  side than on the
coasting side.  If they are only a little worn, meaning you could have left
them alone, you can increase their remaining life by turning them around
so when they are reinstalled they are now wearing on the other side of
things.  This evens the wear out.  But if your mechanic says it sounds
like at least one is gone, I'll bet he finds not a little wear, but a lot on that
one.  A little wear doesn't lead to noise.  Swapping doesn't make a bad
part good again.   Sorry.

Another "swap" involves the theory that the CVs out at the wheels wear
out faster than the ones in at the tranny.  I figured if that was so, and I
only had two CVs which were so bad they had to be replaced, maybe I
should put the new ones out by the wheels, and the OK used ones in by
the tranny (reversed, of course).  However, on reflection I don't see
why on our cars the angular change on each CV shouldn't be
approximately the same (there isn't all THAT much camber change with
suspension travel) on both joints.  Maybe in track applications the outers
get more heat from the brakes.  And maybe this theory is bunk.  But no
matter - this "swap" won't make a badly worn part useable either.

Your wrench says he guesses if one CV is bad, maybe they all are, they
just haven't all started making quite so much racket as one of them has. 
If these are all high mileage CVs, sounds like a pretty good assumption
they are all bad or close enough unless your problem was a broken boot
or something else which would cause one to wear a lot more than the
others.

So you have to ask him what he will charge you, parts and labor, to
replace one joint, versus both on one side, versus all four, and see what
savings there is to getting them all done at once rather than replacing one
and a month later finding the noise is back from another joint, and dealing
with it, etc.  Plus you have to add in your own subjective hassle factor,
taking the car in more often, being without it and suffering withdrawls,
worrying about noises all the time etc.  And ask him what he will charge
to inspect the joints as he removes them, and also to clean and repack
them if they are good.  If he won't charge anything just to inspect, or at
least not much, maybe it is a good gamble to have him do that before
deciding if they all have to be replaced.  I don't know what the flat rate is
on any of this, but once the CV is unbolted and off the axle (which he is
going to do in any case), I'd say it ought to take maybe 5 minutes to find
out if it is junk or not (maybe less - you run your finger through the
grooves, grease and all, and if you can feel a ridge it is history, but you
have to keep going even if this feels OK in case the cage is bad, or
somehow a ball is pitted, etc), and maybe 10 or 15 minutes to really clean
it and repack it.  Always takes me longer, of course, but I'm not an
efficient mechanic working on other people's cars.
  
Your mechanic has figured this all out, heard it before.  And don't be
surprised if he is pretty conservative about what is worn out - He
doesn't want to see you coming in for a couple of years at least for CV
problems, because if he sees you for that he'll figure you'll bitch about
him putting the slightly worn joint back in when with perfect hindsight you
could have saved on his labor now by putting a new one in.  Life's too
short, and a mechanic's reputation, especially one who works on
Porsches, is too valuable for him to feel very good about you maybe
saying bad things about his work even if you swore on a stack of bibles
you wouldn't blame him if things didn't work out.

Now those who have read my occasional posts have picked up on the
fact I am a cheapskate, willing to reuse parts if it is possible, cut corners,
etc.  I have driven various cars for quite a few miles with rumbly CVs,
and no harm has come of it.  They were junk by the time I heard them,
and simply a bit junkier when I got around to replacing them.  However, I
have heard of other people's CVs getting so bad they simply didn't
transmit driving force any more, leaving you stuck wherever you were. 
And some of my racing mechanic buddies like to torture me with tales of
CVs they have seen fail on race cars so dramatically that the axle got
loose, which means you have this heavy rod flailing around at 100 or
150 mph.  Even at 60 would be bad enough.  Doesn't seem to happen
often, but something to think about when pinching the pennies.
