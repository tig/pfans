Greetings fellow Porsche fans,

        I'd like to begin my post by extending a sincere thanks to all who
share knowledge of  
these wonderful little cars. It has been an invaluable resoruce during the
ongoing restoration
of my 67 911.
        After owning the car for about a year now I decided to drop out the
engine/trans and
plug the oil leaks ( there were many , but for the most part I was
successful ) and take a look
at the chain tensioners which turned out to be of the mechanical variety.
Rather crude looking 
devices, but I'll have to live with them for while and there actually not
that difficult to get to and 
adjust ( these early cars are sooo easy to work on , my hats off to you
late model guys who do
your own wrench work).
        My question is can anyone tell me the correct way adjust these
tensioners so the chains 
are not to tight once the engine is up to temp and thermally expanded ? 

TIA
Dan Bittner
