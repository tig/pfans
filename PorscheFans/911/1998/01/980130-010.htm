Low compression on one or more cylinders on a 911SC can indeed be caused
by a ring problem, but it is usually much more than that. 

EVERY SC engine we have pulled apart for low compression has had not
only broken rings but broken or cracked piston ring lands as well. 
Normally, the nikasil cylinders are so tough that they show no wear,
even with broken rings.

Symptoms may be a rough idle, soking at idle or driving, or just a
general roughness in the engine.  Upon disassembly and pulling the
cylinders off, rings pieces will just fall off onto the floor.  They
normally stay in the ring lands unless the piston starts coming apart,
until they are disassembled.  Close inspection will reveal cracks in the
ring lands as well.

We normally see this problem on cars that have a faulty vacuum regulator
on the distributor and the ingnition timing has been set incorrectly.

Beware if you are buying someones used P/C's, for if one piston is
cracked in a set, the others may not yet be cracked but may be stressed.
