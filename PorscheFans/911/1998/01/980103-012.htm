Hi all, and Happy New Year,
   Well, I bet I've done the stupidest thing of any in this
group so far in 98!  Maybe you kind souls can help me, before
I have to kill myself for the good of natural selection.
   I tried to recharge the 6 month old battery in my 86 Carrera.
It was dead because the car is sitting out the winter and the
radio, clock and alarm drew it down.  I don't have an official
battery charger, but rather a variable voltage DC power supply.
So I connected this to the car battery without disconnecting
the negative post.  So what you say?  Well, the power supply
was dialed up to 30 volts, and the trunk light flashed fairwell
to alert me of the situation.  Now the car doesn't start.  The
battery is recharged now, and the instruments come to life when
I turn the key, but the starter doesn't crank.  The radio is
apparently fried, too.  So I'm wondering if there is a voltage
sensitive part in the starting circuit I need to check/purchase?
Any help out there for this knuckle head?   TIA
Yours in bone-headedness, Ray
