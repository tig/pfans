so i've got this new car in my garage (yeah, i know i promised a full
description, gimme a little time...).  it's a '73 coupe, and it's still
got both little batteries, and they're dead (ask me about push starting
in on the way home, and how i arranged for a bathroom break with the
engine on...).  i'll be using the car for street, autox and track.

can someone send me a procedure for converting a '73 to single battery?
looks straightforward, but i'd hate to miss something.

i figure this is a good time to invest in an optima battery.  any one
wanna give me a reason not to?

i'm considering putting the battery in the "smuggler's boot" (the
compartment in the floor of the trunk, just aft of the gastank).  the car
is pretty modified, and it will be in a class that allows battery
relocation, so that's ok.  i've checked the dimensions, and it should fit.
looks like i can route the long battery cable into the boot with ease, and
there's a place on the main body (as opposed to the firewall) to mount a
ground connection securely.  i don't think i'll have trouble securing the
battery in place.

the upside is that this will move a fair amount of weight towards the
center of the car, and put it down low.  i understand this to be a good
thing.  the downsides are thus: it will make it a bit of a pain to do
things like jump-starting; it's weird, and people might whine; and it
moves weight out from the corners, a place that porsche once took great
pains to install weight (the cast-iron bumper weights).

if i don't put it in the smuggler's boot, it looks like it'll have to go
in the driver's side battery box (because of a conflict with the spare
tire on the other side).

so what's the collective wisdom here?  send me email, since i'm on
digest...
