This Saturday I picked up my stainless B&B muffler from the UPS folks after
its second trip to Arizona.
I bought this muffler through Performance Products two plus years ago.  At
first it had an unpleasant resonance which Dave at B&B gladly fixed for
nothing.  All I did was ship it to them from here in Ohio.  No questions,
no grief.
I had also asked to have it straightened, since it hung lower on the
passenger side.  This did not get cured, but I was told to send it back
when I had the car off the road again.
So, this winter as I am doing a clutch job I called Dave up and he said the
hanging problem was rather a part of the nature of this muffler, for a 3,0
SC, but to send it to him and he would see what he could do.  Again, no
charge...just my cost of shipping it out there.
Well, it is back, looks good, and no charge.  When I hang it I will let you
all know if the hang problem is cured, but the point is these guys stuck by
the product and never gave me any problem about a warranty job for a sale
more than two years ago.
That is class.  I recommend the product and the people.

Can anyone refer me to a repair shop that repairs automatic radio antenaes for
my 82 SC?  The motor is fine but the cable needs replacing.  Has anyone had
success with a repair job or is it better to go ahead and bite the bullet and
get a new one.  If so, is there an aftermarket unit that is a good one?
