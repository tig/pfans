David,

I agree with Joshua's response to you rquestion.  I've used Yoko A008R's for two years on a 1967 911 with what I consider great results.  From my experience, the tires will be so much better than the rest of the suspension (unless you've upgraded your car) that they will not be the weak link.

One caution for however.  Today's tires are so much better than the tires that were available when our cars were new that they present a very real problem.  The new tires can generate so much more corning force (g's) that the oil system has problems.  I burned out the bearings on a motor after 6 events.  Several other people in RMVR also burned out engines in this manner.

The problem has to do with the design of the oil tank.  I'm not sure exactly what the problem is but the engine can end up being starved for oil on long fast sweepers to the point that the idiot light comes on.  I'm sure that the same happens more quickly and briefly on tighter corners.

In any event, there is someone that will rebuild you oil tank to prevent this problem.  I don't know the name of the person, but Pat Moyle, my P-wrench, knows and if he is monitoring this list (like I know he does) maybe he can post the name & number of the individual that does this mod.  You can also update to a later oil tank, but would have to change that oil cooler as well.
