David,
I own a 1979 930, and would probably suggest one over a Carrera. 
There's just nothing that compares to how fast this car is!  And I tend
to like the more aggressive look and the wider bodywork.  Maintenance
costs probably will be slightly higher than a non-turbo car, but not
because parts break more often, but because the parts are just more
expensive (spark plug wires, etc.)  For the most part, the 930's are
stronger and more reliable than non-turbo cars, as just about every part
of the 930 was made to handle extra hp.  The transmissions are
bulletproof as well.  I haven't had too much experience with 930's prior
to the one I own now, but after talking to my Porsche tech I get the
impression that the turbos DO NOT go out on these cars (provided you
treat them right, ie. let them cool down before shutting off the
engine).  Overall I love my turbo.  I've had a couple of *minor*
problems, but hey, the car is 19 yrs old.  What else could you buy
that's this much fun though?  If comfort and *civility* are what you
expect from a car, get a Carrera.  Otherwise, try out a turbo.  Lots of
fun!
