Brian:

In general, the 2-wheel-drive 911s aren't real great quarter-mile
cars, especially in their stock form.  When you buy a 911, a lot 
of the money you spend goes toward things that don't directly 
contribute to straight-line acceleration.

Since it sounds as though your only requirement is for street-race
type acceleration, it'd probably be a lot more cost-effective to buy
a GNX or a supercharged Mustang... Or any American V8 with nitrous.
At the upper end of your price range, you could even afford a Viper
roadster, if you can get past the looks of that car.
