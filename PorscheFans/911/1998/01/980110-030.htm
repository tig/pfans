Subject: 993 Wings

Hi,

    I was looking at the silver 993 on Einmalig's web page under
E-Ticket Ride, this is exactly what I was looking for, not too much
alteration of
the original 993 look (see #45 issue of 911 & Porsche World, pg 54, this

looks like the same car with different wheels). I have a 97 993 (Red)
with the 17" Cup wheels as does your silver 993 mentioned above.  This
looks like they added the 3.6 RS Wing and had the car lowered. Could
anyone recommend (BW Motorsports, AIR, Better Bodies, M.A. Shaw) a
source for the wing, I understand that there is some difference in
quality and finish on these glass wings and don't want to install an
inferior quality wing or have to do a lot of rework to get the fit
correctly. I realize I'll need to get the wing prepped, primed and
painted, and have made arrangements for such. Also has anyone had any
experience with Chrome Cup wheels, who does this and how much does it
cost. Do they look good or is it just too much for the car.

    Thanks for your help,

    Mike Wyatt

Subject: Interior lights:

I wasn't sure I understood the gist of your question, but if you want to know
how the  interior light wiring is routed in the headliner/roof, sorry I can't
help. I had the headliner out a few years ago but I didn't notice or I forgot.

If you're wondering how the interior lights get power; they get power from the
glove box light switch assembly. If only one light goes ON, it might be just a
bad bulb (try switching bulbs). If neither interior light goes ON, first check
the fuse box. Also check the glove box light switch and make sure the wires
are connected. They must be connected correctly so the interior light circuit
receives power. If you have a factory manual, you can follow the wires in the
electrical schematic. This is really an important reason to have the factory
manual as other publications reproduce the schematic in B&W (Zoowee, try
following the circuits and seeing what wire is which!).

<HI   ( 911T 1969 coupe )
Im having a problem finding where the
 wires for my interior lights comes down from behind my head liner. 
I ve taken reading on most of my wires but no luck.
Has any body had their head liner out and noticed where the wires came
down?
Any information will be helpful.
Thank You

RE: 911 Brake Fluid Leak

Sounds like the rear seal in the master cylinder is leaking. If you let this
go too long, the pedal cluster bushings (plastic) will start to disintegrate,
then you'll have to replace them.

You can try rebuilding the master cylinder. A kit should run you about $20. A
new master cylinder is about $100.

<I've been doing winter dismantling and just noticed wetness (brake fluid) on 
the underside just aft of the shield that protects the master cylinder and tie
rods (72 911).  When I remove the shield every thing is dry with no leakage 
evident around the master cylinder.  However, there is brake fluid around the 
pedal assembly and in the master cylinder support tray (inside the car).  Does
this mean my master cylinder is bad?  I remember reading somewhere that the 
pedal must be properly aligned with the master cylinder.  Could this be the 
problem?  If so, can someone help with proper alignment?

TIA

Hi:  This is my first attempt at posting a response so here we go. 

In response to Scott Galaba's question about what heat codes to use for plugs
on his '87 carrera(I have one too)-Everyone I speak to recommends to get the
colder plug unless you're plugs look dirty from oil. I recently changed my
plugs with Bosch platinum plugs and got the colder set. IMPORTANT TIP! Before
you change them make sure the car is cold and spray some penetrating oil like
Liquid Wrench around the plugs and let the oil penetrate for at least 30
minutes. I didn't do that and sheared plug no 6(right rear most plug) and left
the threaded part of the plug in the engine which then had to be CAREFULLY
extracted. 
Regarding performance wires-I replaced by old cracked wires with Beru wires so
I don't have personal experience but I know some people who use them in their
Formula Vee race cars and they've reported noticable gains. 

In response to J.Uhalaine's question about brake lights not working.
I changed both brake switches on my car which has redundant switches located
on the master cylinder under the hood. I think your model is the same. You'll
have to move some hoses(easy job) to get to them and the whole job is pretty
simple. While you're backing out the old switch you might want to have someone
press the brake pedal to maintain positive pressure on the fluid and hopefully
avoid having to bleed the brakes. It worked great for me. The entire job to
replace both switches took less than one hour. Fortunately, the brake switches
were pretty cheap(around $15 each).

I'm considering purchasing an '85 911 coupe and would like to know where I
would find the option code numbers on the vehicle. Appreciate any help.
