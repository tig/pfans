Porschefans,

I own a 67 911 that I have been putting a 82 3.0 litter in and ran into one
problem with the 915 trans going into the early car with the early Lobros. The
early Lobros won't bolt up to the 915 axel flange. The only way around this I
could find was swapping parts from hear and there and pretty much putting the
later rear suspension under the car to make the thing work, which is virtual
cost prohibitive for a pre 68 car due to the short wheel base.

So, instead I have made an adapter that bolts to the 915 trans and then adapts
the earlyLobros to it. And whalah!!!! 3.0 with 915 trans and no night mare of
parts swaping. 

To make a long story short. I have these adapters for sale. Machined out of
steel and ready to handle torque in the range of 400 foot pounds (If you need
more torque capability for racing let me know. We could us a stronger steel.)
If you would like to see a picture of these I will e-mail them to you. For the
pair I am asking 300. Or 150 each.

Please e-mail me directly for the pictures and I will e-mail them back to you.
