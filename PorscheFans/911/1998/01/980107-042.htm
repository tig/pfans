I bought a 1976 Porsche 911S Targa in June of 1996.

I have been interested in restoring and improving the car and have made
several repairs and restorations to this point. I would be interested in
any comments or information you may be able to provide regarding the
following. I am entertaining the idea of rebuilding the engine in the
near future. The present 2.7 engine had been updated with oil-fed chain
tensioners, and I have installed an eleven-blade fan, K&N air filter,
etc. Now, though, the number five cylinder has developed a compression
leak. One option is to just rebuild the present engine with raceware
studs, etc. The other option is to replace it with a rebuilt 3.0 SC or
3.2 engine. Can you give advice as to the feasibility of this upgrade
and comment on any modifications to any other systems (wiring, fuel,
emissions, etc.) that would be affected (what specifically may need to
be done)? I have already considered upgrading the exhaust to Borla. If
an engine upgrade is done, would you suggest different cam profiles,
valves, valve springs, rockers, higher compression pistons etc. for
higher top end and more performance? Would an enlarged throttle body be
a good upgrade for the money? What specifically would you recommend? I
have also been interested in upgrading the suspension with gas Koni's or
Blistein's, 22mm Weltmeister front and rear adjustable sway bars, and
front camber brace. For these various upgrades, what specifically would
you recommend, and what suppliers would offer good quality at a
reasonable cost? An add in excellence magazine for Motor Meister in
California caught my eye for their price on a rebuilt 3.0 or 3.2
($3595/$3995).  Has anyone had any experience with them or recommend
anyone else? 
Also, has anyone repainted their original Fuchs?  Do you have
suggestions as to how to tape off the center "star" so that a
consistent, smooth line is acheived? Is there a pattern I can buy and
what kind of paint is best?

What it all comes down to is this: What suspension and engine upgrades
show the most fundamental and worthwhile performance increases for the
money. Anything you could contribute would be very greatly appreciated.
I am interested in doing as much of the work as possible myself as a
hobby. 
Please excuse the message length, I am new at this and have many
questions.
Thank you in advance for your help and advice.

Is it possible to fit a 930 air box and exhaust system to a 3.2 Carrera ?
What is the extent of modifications ? minor, major, hours, not possible,
etc...
Does it make much sense to do so for increased performance ?
Idea is to increase air flow with 930 air box to a normally aspirated 3.2
motor and hopefully increase performance HP, etc...  Possible ? Or, waste of
time ? Estimated increase in performance ?

Will 930 exhaust system help ?  Estimated increase in performance ?

Please advise.
