Alex,

I rebuilt my 82 SC mirrors a few months ago because of the same problem.
It is fairly easy.  There should be a socket cap screw holding the base
to the door.  Unscrew it and remove the whole mirror assy. from the
door.  There is a nifty hollow bolt and spring combination that provides
the break away affect for the mirror that has gotten loose.  The hollow
bolt goes through the base and screws into the mirror shell (if I
remember correctly). You have to use a large Allen wrench to tighten
this hollow bolt.  

The problem arises when you realize that all the wiring for the power
mirror goes right through the middle of the bolt, which is where you are
supposed to insert the Allen wrench as well.  It does not take long to
understand that the wrench and wires can not occupy the same space at
once.  So, snip snip go the wires and you must pull them up into the
mirror assy.  

At this point I chose to take the entire thing apart by starting with
the mirror glass.  It will pry off if you are gentle with it but be
careful to also remove the heating element wires from the back of the
glass.  Then there should be 3 hex bolts/screws you can unscrew to
remove the mirror drive.  This is a sealed part with the thick rubber
edge attached to it as well.  All you are left with should be a metal
shell of the mirror and the hollow bolt/spring in the base.

Unscrew the bolt completely and clean all the parts.  Be careful not to
loose the plastic washers.  After cleaning apply a little multi-purpose
grease to the threaded end of the hollow bolt and screw it through the
base and into the mirror shell with all the plastic parts and spring in
their correct places.  Make sure it is tight and provides a good amount
of resistance to being rotated.  The object here is not to prevent
rotation but just make it hard so if some idiot smashes into your mirror
it will rotate instead of rip off your door.

Put the wires back through the threaded tube.  DON'T forget to put the
little rubber seal on the base now because if you solder the wires back
together then you will have to cut the seal to get it back on (when my
car was painted by the PO they did this BAD BAD).

Now, you have two options here.  You can permanently reattach the wires
or you can put in a connector in case this problem arises again.  I
personally put in a connector because I will be repainting the car again
(previous job REALLY sucked) and will have to take the mirrors off
again.  You can take a short run to Radio Snak and find some nice 6
pin(I think) connectors.  Don't forget to buy the pin removal tool as
well as the connector will not fit through the hollow bolt if you have
to rebuild your mirror again.

So, reconnect your wires and then bolt the base back to the door while
making sure that the seal is even all the way around.

DONE.

If you now have a vibration in your mirror and can not see anything in
it at speed then you might have front wheels that are out of balance or
have flat spot in them.  My mechanic told me this.


Have fun!

-Michael, who is finally driving again @weeee
