Tom Manson asks about powdercoating chrome trim black, wondering
about the fit afterwards.  I had this done (anodizing seemed expensive,
and  the factory anodized cars I looked at then (SCs) had faded
anyway) to all the chrome trim on my car except the door handles
(which I had replaced with black ones earlier).  Had no effect that I could
see on fit.  Certainly did not affect putting the front and rear windshield
trim in the rubber.

I did this in 88 or 89 when I had car repainted.  Other than the odd nick or
scratch, the only powdercoating which has not held up all that well is
that on the door pieces - the flat horizontals just below the glass.  I don't
drive with my arm resting there (and same is happening to passenger
side, which seldom has an occupant), so I theorize that because it faces
up it must weather faster.  In any case, one of these days I will take
these off (Murphy's law failed here, as they are perhaps the easiest of
all the trim pieces to remove) and have it recoated.
