Hi John,

The mirror glass has three 'plugs' that are springy.  As they are
pressed into their holes they grip so the glass stays on the mirror
motor assy.  This assy. has a tin backing plate that the glass will sit
on after it is placed back into the mirror.  I used a wide flat head
screw driver and went around the edge of the mirror working the glass
out a little at a time.  When you are done with it all you can just push
the glass back on very easily.

My mirror is an SC (78-83) mirror.  I am not sure that your '77 one will
be the same.  But, it should not be that hard to figure it all out as
there really cant be that many parts.

I hope I answered your questions!
