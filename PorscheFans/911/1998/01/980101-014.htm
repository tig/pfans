Happy, safe, and prosperous 1998 to this knowledgeable body.

I have a few questions concerning my 1988 Targa.  As a relatively new
Porsche owner (but life long enthusiast), I don't plan on doing any of
the work myself but wanted to get the list's opinion on a few things
before taking it into the mechanic.

1) My dash board seat belt light remains on all the time with the
ignition on.  I would expect it to go out when driver or driver &
passenger belts are clipped.  Is this normal?  Can any one else out
there with an 88 or similar vintage confirm if yours does the same or if
mine is behaving abnormally?  The light is, of course,  hardly visible
during daytime but fairly bright at night.

2) When I roll to a complete stop, clutch pressed down but car still in
gear, the car feels like the gear is still somewhat engaged (hard to
describe exactly but somewhat of a very faint pulsation).  As soon as I
put the car into neutral, it goes away.  When I re-engage first gear,
the pulsation is not there.  As I mentioned, this is extremely faint and
is only noticeable when the car is completely stopped.  The wondercar
has 96K easy miles on the original engine, clutch, and transmission
(going to its first track event this February...)  Could this be a
symptom of impending clutch failure or just a simple adjustment?

Thanks in advance for your feedback to these.  May 1998 provide lots of
Porsche drive time.
