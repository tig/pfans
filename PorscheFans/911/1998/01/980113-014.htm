Dirk,

Buy one and smile.  No corrosion or rust worries.  Costs
less than two batteries.  Mine has lasted four years and counting.

This is exactly what I did for all the reasons you mention.  Come look at
mine if you want.  My car had a channel into the passenger footwell from
the smugglers boot which I decided to have welded shut on principle

Some people do whine when you mess with originality, but your car is
far from that anyway.  As far as jump starting goes, it's actually easier
than trying to get jumper cables on the older, smaller batteries that are
wedged into tight little corners with all that fuse box and fuel canister
stuff in the way.

Other benefit (for me) was that I was able to remove
the battery boxes which were rusted.  Now there is a direct air
channel from the right front horn grill to the oil cooler resulting
in ram air of sorts since the battery box is gone.  Mucho better oil
cooling and way cleaner looking all the way around.
