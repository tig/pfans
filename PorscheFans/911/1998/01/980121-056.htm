Hi Scott.  My 86 Targa has 3 leaks.  Both windows leak above the fixed side
windows.  Those are minor and a towel on each seat soaks up anything that gets
through.  The other place where it leaks is on the passenger side, on the
front edge of the Targa bar.  If you look at the window in the passenger door,
near the rear edge, up near the top, above the felt strip there is a little
"gap" where water running down the front seal of the targa bar would run out
and down the side of the car.  Mine leaks in there, runs down inside until it
hits the carpet just behind the passenger seat.  Fortunately it only leaks
when it's sitting in the rain, and not when it is covered (I keep it covered
all the time).  While driving it doesn't leak.  I've tried many things to seal
it there but nothing has worked yet.  The seals are in good shape so I am
reluctant to replace them (high cost).  I'm guess your's might be leaking
there too.  I use on of those "Dry-Z-Air" things and it works pretty good, the
car never feels moist inside.  You can find them cheaper at Orchard Supply or
Camping World than you can order them for ($7 at Camping World last I
checked).

Good luck...let me know if you stop it from leaking.
