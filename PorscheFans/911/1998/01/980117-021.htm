Hi Jeff:

  Great idea to this upgrade!. Assuming that you are talking about using
the 2.7 RS piston and cylinders, this will make a fine combination.

Camshaft choice depends upon usage; for a 911 that will be used
primarily on the street, the Solex cams are a good compromise between
torque and peak power. The "S" cams are excellent choices for street
driven 911's that have some gearing changes and a compression increase.
These latter items really make a bigger difference than what its
appears. A well-designed short gear stack adds "50 HP" to the overall
performance of a 911.
This difference must be experienced to be believed! Ask someone for a
ride in their 911 equipped with shorter gears.
To take advantage of the "S" cams potential, you should open the ports
up to the same approximate size that those engines were equipped with.

We are very partial to the RS-spec engines with "S" cams, "S"-sized
ports, and Mechanical Fuel Injection or Webers. These engines work quite
well with SSI heat exhangers or headers (1 5/8"). There is also a wide
host of options that can create a 250+ HP 2.7 RS engine. Very exciting!

Hope this helps a little,

Best Regards,
