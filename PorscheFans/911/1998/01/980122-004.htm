Hey Pfans:

I received a rebuilt starter from Zims yesterday.  There is a noticeable
difference from my original starter  (83SC).
I have push on type fittings for the wiring on my old starter.  The
rebuild model has screws (and one is missing).  I am assuming that Radio
Shack or some such place has clips which I can use to convert the new
one to push on type fittings.  Anyone know a source or have a suggested
method?

More importantly, one of the fittings has a different number designation
than my old one.  There is of course the large fitting for the wire from
the battery, but instead of a 15a post, as on my old one and as is
designated on my wiring diagram, the new one has a 16 post.  This is the
wire that goes to the start up valve.  I have surmised that the solenoid
on the new starter came from an earlier SC which had the 16 post noted
on the wiring diagram for that year.
Is this a big deal?  Can I just make the fittings compatible and not
worry about the difference in numerical designation for this post?
(both have the 50 post)

TIA
