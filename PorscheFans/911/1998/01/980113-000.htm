Hi Tom:

The term, "Crankfire" usually refers to a crankshaft-triggered ignition
system that can trigger a conventional distributor or a Distributorless,
multi-coil ignition. These utilize a sensor timed to crankshaft position
rather than cam position.
The sensor can be placed at either end of the crank/flywheel, however
its sometimes easier to place the sensor at the pulley on cars not
equipped with a special triggering flywheel such as used on Motronic
cars.

These are made by Electromotive, MoTec, EFI, and some others.

The advance curves can be controlled with several potentiometers, or
with a laptop in the case of an Engine Management System.

An Engine Management System, such as the Electromotive TEC II or MoTec
M-series controls both fuel and ignition events, as well as a host of
other things.

Prices range from $ 850 for a single ignition add-on systems to $ 10K or
more for a high-end EMS that controls all of the engine's events and
provides data acquisition and telemetry.

You can get systems for every price in-between, too!
