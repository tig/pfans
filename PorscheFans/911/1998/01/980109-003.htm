Just some info

I have had warm-up problems with my car for a while now

I have now replaced the Warm-Up Regulator (lots of dollars in Australia)
as well as having the car off the road to enable the mechanic to check
this and that (what a pain)

The car was backfiring on startup until the motor warmed up but the
backfiring disappeared after the following:
1) 2 cans of Wynn's Decoke thru the motor; 2) take the car for a mega
drive

Mine is a 3-speed sportomatic (new servo just fitted too) and I took it
out of Darwin "down the track" where there is no speed limit. I spent
most of my time in 2nd running it on the redline for 1-2 minutes at a
time and sitting on around 150-160 kms/hr
I also ran it at 190, 200 and 210 kms/hr for intervals of 30 seconds to
4 minutes
(Someone was behind me trying to catch up but couldn't!!)

The point of this is that if your car hasn't had a big run lately, fill
it up with gas and oil, check the tyres, and set out for a mega drive

My idle speed is now constant rather then "hunting" up and down and the
acceleration is even more wicked than before
