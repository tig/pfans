like to carry ski's on it (it snows in Germany doesn't it).  If no one
makes one I guess I'll have to get out the drafting board and the arc
welder......

Performance Products (1-800-423-3173) shows one for $198.50 ( 2 bikes) plus
$95 for the ski attachment (2 pr).  Says it "doesn't touch your Porsche".
Attaches to a special license plate bracket and then by a single strap to
the top of the bonnet...  Enough clearance for Turbo and Carrera tails...
Some cars with polyurethane bumpers may require drilling [for the license
plate bracket].  Instructions and hardware included."

I'd sure like to hear from someone who's actually used one of these.  From
the pix it looks well made enough, but it doesn't look like it'd be very
stable laterally and appears that it'd be putting a lot of torque on the
licence plate mounting holes.  I wonder how strong they are.

I can't access 1998 archive materials on the Porschefans listery, only 96 and
97.  AOL is my server.  Any tricks or instructions available for 1998 access?
Thanks.
