On repairing oem antenna,  if the cable you refer to is the white nylon
piece attached to the antenna mast, it is replaced with the telescoping
mast as one unit. We stock them at my car audio shop and I`m sure many
others do as well. You could also try your local Porsche dealer as this
is a common part to go bad. Im not at work now, but I believe around $39
retail.     A couple of things to watch for-  look for a number (02
etc.) on top of the finial (I bet you didn`t know the little ball thingy
on the tip of an antenna had a name did you)  make sure it matches. the
wrong one will fit but it might stall the motor and burn it out or kill
your battery.  Also compare the new mast`s nylon cord to the old one.
If it appears longer, a section of the old mast might be lingering
inside your antenna motor.  This would require complete disassembly and
might not be something you want to get into.
   The process for changing a mast is quite simple. Unscrew the 12mm (I
think) nut on the top of the fender (the two flat little one not the
larger hex) and have someone turn on the radio while you feed out the
old one. Slip in the new masts` nylon  cord and have your helper turn
off the radio. As the motor runs, a little twisting and turning will get
the mast started. If you dont get it the first time, turn the radio back
on and try giving the nylon piece a little curve on the tip to help it
wrap arounf the gear inside.  Don`t worry if it doesnt retract all the
way on installation, just install the nut and run it up and down. The
internal clutch will put every thing back in sync.   If you break a
mast, it`s important that you replace it right away.  Unlike most power
antennas, these hirshmanns seem to last forever. What kills them is the
water that runs down into them when there is no mast to fill the top
hole.
    After all this, if the cable you are referring to is the actual coax
radio cable, it just screws onto the antenna chassis and is a
replacement part. We also carry these at our shop.
