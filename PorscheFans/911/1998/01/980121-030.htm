Hi,

The speed at which it is safe to do this is dependent on which gearbox you
have, and exactly what effect you're trying to get.

If you want to give a great effect by spreading little pieces of exploded
gearbox, dual-mass flywheel etc, over that offramp, then I'd think the 'drop
in reverse' speed would be anything over one or two MPH.

*IF* you have a G50 gearbox with reverse gear syncro, that is.

With an earlier gearbox with no reverse synchro, the effect would be more like:

GRIND... GRIND... (slow down) GRIND... GRIND... (slow down more) GRIND...
GRIND... (slow down to 0 MPH) Thunk! - i.e. it'd be more an audio show than
a visual effect. You'd gets lots of approving shouts from the crowd ("Hey,
Grind me a pound, too!") though.

Now... if you're talking about a Tiptronic - no experience, but it's equally
a BAD IDEA to drop it in reverse with the car moving forward!

Cheers,

Ross
