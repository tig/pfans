Hey Gang,

Dirk had a message about doing an alignment at home VS at a shop.  I
was in Daytona this past weekend crewing for a GT3 911.  Almost all
the race teams do their alignment with strings and rulers.  Once the
initial alignment is set, there is no reason someone could not make
adjustments to their alignment at home.  I'm planning to take my car
to get it's first alignment after rebuilding the suspension to a local
shop just to get a good baseline to start from.  I will probably make
my adjustments at home in my garage. It's not rocket science, and a
little math will get you where you want to be.

John
