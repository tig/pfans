Before you spend your money on a B&B or other aftermarket muffler, I suggest
you take your stock Carrera muffler to a welding/fabrication type shop and
have then cut your muffler in half around the seam then have them cut out
the inner baffles and remove all the stuff, reweld the muffler together
(much lighter) and reinstall. It sounds great, stock loudness at idle and
screams when floored, also find a European pre-muffler (10hp per bruce
anderson) or bypass pipe (5hp) and you will be happy. Stock appearance
(nice), raspy-superbike sound at full throttle (incredible), near-normal db
levels at crusing
speed, with no reverb. as with B&B twin outlet mufflers that will drive you
nuts. It should only cost you around $50-100 to complete! At track event at
Homestead Motor Speedway people couldn't believe the cool sounds my car was
making
as it was bouncing off of the side walls of the track.
Good Luck in your dilemma.

I saw in a magazine an air box for 911 that was altered to take in more air
and increase HP.  Some company basically cut holes in factory 911 air box in
some orderly fashion and covered the holes from the inside with some type of
tightly woven black mesh/screen.  I've been thinking about doing it myself and
wondering will letting in more air through the air box help performance?  I
know it will make me go thru air filters faster, but filters aren't real
expensive so who cares.  Anyone know where to get the best price on 911
Carrera 3.2 OEM quality filters?
Or, should I spend money and upgrade to K&N filter and clean myself when
dirty?
Anyone know who has the best price on K&N filter kits?
By altering my air box and letting in more air, will my computer automatically
reset the fuel mixture to adjust for the added intake of air?  Or , will the
car run leaner, because the computer will not automatically adjust the proper
fuel&air mixture?
Any thoughts on this basic air box alteration?  Any potential danger/pitfalls
to the car, motor, performance, etc...?
The kit I saw was a combination of a new altered/improved air box coupled with
a chip for the computer too, selling for around $400.  I've been guided by my
very reliable 9 year Porsche mechanic against putting chip in my 911.  Car is
Euro 1985 Carrera and mechanic said chip in the Euro is already beefed up
enough and his experience with chips has not been good, as chips he saw and
installed in the past always lowered oil pressure, which in his mind shortened
the engine life over time.  Any thoughts here on adding/installing chips in
Euro 911?
