Found on the BMW Digest:

>>Some interesting reading from the Richmond Times Dispatch, Sunday, 
January 5, 1998, summarized in part as follows:

- -------

Lt. Col. W. Gerald Massengill, director of field operations for the Virginia
State Police, was quoted in a front page lead story regarding troopers
involved in 348 wrecks in a three year period in which only two charges were
filed.  Lt. Col. Massengill said driving above the maximum safe speed "doesn't
necessarily mean you violated a law." (Laminate this and place it alongside
your driver's license for the next time you're stopped for exceeding the
"maximum safe speed!" )

The Virginia State Police Superintendent, M. Wayne Huggins, commenting on a
trooper's quote that  "We don't charge people who hit us, and we don't charge
us":  'I think it certainly is the practice . . . but it is not the policy."

Also, Capt. W. Steven Flaherty, the department's top safety officer, responded
that ticketing officers might discourage them from doing their jobs. "If [the
troopers] were to be subjected to all of the repercussions for a traffic
violation, like insurance increases. . .and, of course, the jeopardy your
license would be in, I think it would cause police officers to have a second
thought as to whether they were going to choose to pursue a vehicle, or that
sort of thing.>>
