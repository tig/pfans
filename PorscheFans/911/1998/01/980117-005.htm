Hello Porsche Fans,

    I'm going to be installing a 3.8 GT style wing on my 97 993. This
wing has a rear brake light imbedded and I need to know a convent point
to "tap off" the brake light signal going to the brake lights. I'll also
be utilizing the standard available battery voltage used for the rear
lid light to help power a GPS and Cellular Modem (phone type), plus a
small computer to run the system. This is part of a project to use these
technologies to help locate a stolen or missing vehicle. If one would
like to know the whereabouts of the vehicle, one simply "calls" the
cellular Modem in the vehicle with a PC (Laptop is fine) and a map
appears on the screen with the vehicles location. Also, one can request
the past 24hrs of the vehicles location. Eventually the system will be
covertly hidden in the engine compartment, so would-be thief's don't
have an idea they are being watched. I've be involved in a highly
successful criminal tracking system (as seen on Discovery Jan 16 at 9
PM) as a consultant. This system is undergoing field testing now around
the country. See the past few days of posts for more details on this
project, it's planned to be offered commercially. If anyone could help
with the convent rear (inside the engine compartment) "tap off" point
for the brake light signal I would greatly appreciate it.

    Thanks,
