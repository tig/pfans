If I were being sensible I'd probably direct this by private email to Andy
Warren, who continues to amaze me with this knowledge of just about
anything to do with cars, where to get anything, prices, shipping policies,
and probably the relevant technical contributions of the head of the
suppliers engineering staff.  On the other hand, other opinions are also
welcome.

I've been using Beverly Hill Motoring Accessories simple cotton car covers
for a long time.  Some cars sit out, the main driver (ragtop) usually gets
covered whenever parked outside (including running errands).  I like the 
cotton for its softness and lightness (easy to stash in the car, not as much
a miserable mess if it happens to get rained on).  Unfortunately, BHMA
accessories has changed ownership and is having serious delivery
problems.  They owe me a van cover from July.  That one I'm working up
the chain.

What I think I need, for 911s and some other cars, is a source of good
cotton covers that fit well.  Automotion has a variety of stuff, but their
basic cover is poly-cotton, which I think will be harder on the paint.

Anyone have any sources they like?
