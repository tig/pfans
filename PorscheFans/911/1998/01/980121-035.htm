Hi folks,

I'm in the process of building an oil tank for my car, and am planning
on using AN fittings, simply because they are much more readily available.
Which size would be the most appropriate to use (-12, -14, -16), and would
the recommended size change if I were to add a front mounted oil cooler
(would I want a larger diameter line?)?  The engine is a 2.4, though it
may eventually get swapped with a 2.7, or 3.0, and I'd like to err on the
safe size.

Also, I took a look in the original tank, and the anti-foaming baffle
appears to simply be a piece of steel mesh, like a storm window screen.
I will be substituting a thin steel plate with bell-mouthed holes (like
in the Fournier book).  I was wondering if there was a need for any
vertical, anti-sloshing type of baffle.  I understand that some of the
early 911 oil tanks were changed, and these added to prevent oil starvation?
What sould something like this look like.

Other than that, the oil tank seems fairly simple to construct.
Of course, mine isn't complete yet, but I'll bet I'm gonna wonder how
come the OEM ones are so much....

Thanks,
Mike
