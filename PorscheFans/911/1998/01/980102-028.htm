during a track event this summer i saw a RSA with an interesting mod, the
blower for the interior heater/AC was removed and replaced with  a bypass
tube.. the tube came over the fan shroud, over the twin distributer, and
then into the hole.... art these hard to find?? the guy hinted that they
are,  and it was from a 962?? or some other track beast... it almost looks
like you could fabricate one yourself...
any info apprec'd.

Trivia Fans,

Maybe a Euro 996 owner can answer this, or someone who has been to the LA 996
premier. A report?

A free after New Years aspirin to anyone who can tell me the Rear Wheel offset
used on a 996 with the Turbo Technology 18"  Wheel Option. The offset on the
rear wheel for the 993 Turbo is 65mm on the 10" wide wheel. 

Does the 996 use the same rear 18" wheel as the 993 Turbo? Note the front
wheels are slightly different 996 18" wheel option versus 993 Turbo: 7.5
versus 8.0J respectively.

Thanks.

Hi Pfans

The anti-sway bar on the right rear of my 1987 Cabriolet has broken loose. The
ears  on the  anti-sway bar bracket that the clamp bolts to have broken off.
The bracket is welded to the floor pan. My question is, does Porsche sell a
replacement bracket and, if so, does anyone know the part number? There are
plenty of places around here that can do a weld repair but I'd rather have a
new  bracket welded on if one is available.
Thanks
Jack

     What should the CO percentage be set at on a 3.0 liter SC engine?  I was
having a erratic idle(low loping) and intake backfiring problem with my 82 SC
had it scoped and the CO percentage was at .001,  the mechanic reset the level
to 2% stating that it would not pass smog but would take care of the lean idle
problems.  Seems to have worked just wanted some other opinions.

Thanks
Glen 82' SC
