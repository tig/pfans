What I was doing (and I think most of my competition)was taching up to
around 5000 and simply popping the clutch out at the last orange light.  =
To
be competitive you had to have a reaction time of about .5 seconds (from
green light until you break the start beam).  Anything slower than just a=
n
abrupt engagement of the clutch netted about a 1 second or so reaction ti=
me.
That is, you lost it at the light.  As I said, I don't do this type of st=
art
all the time but no one seemed to have any problem with it.

I didn't see any of the 911s do any wheel spin.  It seemed to me that the
clutch absorbed most of the energy by not being 100% hooked up for the fi=
rst
second or so.  Such abuse didn't seem to make the clutch act any differen=
tly
(Is there such a thing as "clutch fade"?)  It just quietly took the
punishment.  I just did a clutch change and the old disk still looked pre=
tty
good (I had to drop the motor to quash some oil leaks up behind the airbo=
x).

Don't get me wrong here--I am not advising that this is a "nice" way to
treat your machine.  I just think that the paranoia we all fall prey to
concerning our car's welfare may be a little out of control.  I feel deep
down inside that Porsche has built a pretty stout machine that can take a=
n
occasional thrashing--and love it.

Alan - unfortunately the only car I had still running at the Parade was m=
y
1 ton Chevy van tow vehicle, so I passed up the night at the drags.  I
certainly believe what you say about not having broken your car.  But
how exactly did you use the clutch?  Did you let it out pretty quickly, o=
r
literally sidestep it - move your foot sideways so the clutch pedal just
popped back.  Or something in between?

Did any of the Porsches spin tires starting?


Fixing trannies has always cost me $800 a pop (not including R&R),
leading to some conservatism.

I want to buy an open trailer for use transporting a 93 RSA to and from driver
ed events.  I'm interested in an open trailer, but I need imput on specifics
such as "best brand," optimal length, what extras are essential vs luxury
(i.e. winch, tool box, tire rack, etc.).  All advice appreciated.

Hey Guys,

One of the things I have to do in the next few days, before I drop off my car
with the painter (I will be updating my page when I get a chance), will be to
put new bushings in the hinges of the drivers side door.  I've got the
bushings and one new hinge pin.

Has anyone installed these things.  My porsche parts book says they have to be
installed, then sized to fit.  I figure I'll have to find a reamer of proper
diameter.

Any sugestions on this.

BTW, thanks to everyone for the great info and photo's on changing my car from
all tan to tan and black interior part.  I haven't descided yet, but I have a
few week to do so.

Thanks guys
