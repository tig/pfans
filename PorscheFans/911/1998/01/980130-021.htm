Jeff:

Seems like a lot for an engine stud, though that's probably what everyone is
charging.

Hell, at the high end there ($6K), just buy another motor, maybe a 3.6L and
slap that into the ass of that '81!

It's really pitiful the price-gouging that goes on in the pCar world....good
luck!

Best regards,
