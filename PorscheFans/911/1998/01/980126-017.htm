Hi Moe,

>could someone explain the operation of the rpm transducer? i think
>it only effects the mfi system and not the tach, but i'm not sure.
>how important is this part to the running of the car?

The rpm transducer is used to activate the shut-off solenoid on the MFI
pump.  It prevents the pump from continuing to pump fuel into the engine
when coasting at high speed, which will result in backfiring and other
unpleasantness.

The rpm transducer puts out 12v above about 1600 rpm, and 0v below it.
It's connected to the MFI shut-off solenoid through a microswitch that's
activated by the accelerator linkage--the one on the left side of the engine,
attached to the input stacks.  With your foot off the accelerator, the switch
is closed, and if the engine speed is above 1600 rpm, i.e., you're coasting at
speed, then  12v is applied to the relay and it shuts off the pump.  If you're
below 1600 rpm, even though the switch is closed, i.e., you're idling, the
solenoid is not activated because the sensor is putting out 0v, and fuel
is pumped to the engine.

The transistor leads corrode and break over time.  Virtually any generic NPN,
like a 2N2222, will work.
