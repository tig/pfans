I bought an 1988 Cab. about a month ago.  Here is a small problem that I have
probably spent 4 hours on already.  Obviously it's no big deal, but it gives
me something to think about.  I have manual heat controls between the seats.
When I engage them with the additional blower switch in the  "0" position the
additional blowers behind the kickwell panel engage on low.  When I switch the
control to "1" nothing additional happens, they still stay on low.  (I am
assuming that on "0" the additional blowers should not be activated.  Position
"2" and "3" seem to work fine.  I pulled switch between the seats.  I am
reasonably familiar with automotive electrical systems, however I can not
figure out how that switch works.  If anyone has ever seen it there are
microswitches for positions "2" and "3", but nothing for "1".  I am not sure
how the switch activates position "1" and why my fans are engaged when the
switch is on "0" with the heat lever activated.  Does it have anything to do
with the potentiaometer built into the switch, is the switch bad or could it
be the relay?  Thanks in advance.
