Hi Chris,
Yes, you need to buy the adhesive.  I replaced mine a few years ago and was told to use Wurth's rubber cement.  It worked great.

Now my question:
I have another repair underway (steering wheel cover) and I noticed the same non-hardening adhesive residue I found on my sunroof seals so I went for my can of Wurth's.  It has since turned into a rubbery, jello like
substance and is totally unusable.
The reason for this diatribe is that I am looking for a replacement adhesive.  I've called around and have not been able to locate another can of Wurth's and I have forgotten where I last ordered it from (obviously a
LONG time ago :).  Since I live in 3M country I would think they would have one.  Anyone know of any good adhesive for reattaching the center leather to the steering wheel?  Is Wurth's my best bet?  If so, who stocks
the stuff?

Thanks.
Jon
