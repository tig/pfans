Ross:
I regret your fix did not fix the problem. I have supposed all along (without
knowing why, I might add) that the problem was in line before the AC\Heater unit.
Something  such as a sticking relay or faulty thermostat is likely the problem.
I have the wiring diagram but I can't quite figure out the exact route of all the
wires from fuse 1 which eventually make their way to the unit. You'll remember
pulling fuse 1 solves the run on problem but running the car without that fuse is
probably hazardous at best given the devices the fuse powers. I would hope one of
our Porschefans friends with an eye for wiring diagrams could help. By the way,
when fuse 1 is pulled the battery draw is right at Porsche spec -.01 amps. So at
least with my Porsche solving this dilemma solves my battery run down problem.
I'll keep all our friends and you advised
Thanks

I recently was doing some winter maint. on my 72T. I came across some problems
I was hoping I could get a few opinions on.

1)  Before starting this cleaning job the idle on my car was high, about 1500
RPM. Adjusting the airscrews had no effect. ( the car is a 2.4 MFI). I
proceded to dismantle the air stacks and throttle bodies.( under the air
stacks) and noticed alot of carbon build up.  One thing to note was that the
vacume advance lines in the throttle bodies were pluged with carbon. I cleaned
every thing and reassembled it all.  THe problem is that now the idle is even
higher.  I have the air screws in all the way and it idles at 1500 when warm.
Correct me if I'm wrong but,  I would think that with the air screws all the
way in the engine would not run. would the vacume advance being pluged have
any thing to do with it?  

2) could anyone describe what a tensioner going bad sounds like?? and how esle
could I check the tensioners? can you get to them with the engine in?

Thanks in advance for all of your help
