A short history of 911 brakes up to the monster caliper era of the C2 and
newer (turbos excepted):

The brakes on our cars from 74 through 89 (end of Carrera 3.2) were
almost identical, front and rear, with one exception: For the Carreras
(84-89) the rotors were made 4mm thicker - from 20mm to 24mm,
because the cars had grown heavier and a greater rotor thermal mass
(they are heavier) was desired.  As a result, the calipers were also
made thicker by adding a spacer between the halves.  So you can use
the same pads for all these years.  However, you can't use Carrera
rotors on your SC (new brake pads wouldn't fit, rotor too thick for
caliper) unless you change over to Carrera calipers also.  Which would
be easy to do, but why?

Actually, the pad sizes go farther back:  the rear pad size (sometimes
called the M caliper size - your SC has M calipers in the rear) goes back
to the first 911 in the rear, and for some years (especially in the less
expensive T models) this size was also used in the front (and appeared
there on the 356Cs, and on some 914s).  The fabled aluminum S caliper
in the front took the same pad as the later cast iron A caliper you have
on your SC, although since the S caliper was a bit wider, proper S pads
are thicker when new than A pads, so they won't quite fit in an A caliper
(with a new, full thickness rotor).  This small extra thickness is also why
they cost a lot more.  Worn S pads fit fine in the A caliper, and new A
pads fit fine in the S caliper, they just approximate a slightly worn pad in
that application.

I think all these calipers were made by ATE, a German brake firm.  I don't
think there are any Porsche part numbers on these calipers, but maybe
there are.  You don't need these numbers, however.  Nor do you need
the Porsche part numbers for the pads.

You can figure out a lot of this by looking at the catalogs.  Automotion
has a dandy table on rotor thickness over the years, but you can see a
lot of this interchangeability by looking for comparable brake pad part
numbers.  Oddities might include the Carrera pads, which have a wear
sensor connection (and so cost more and are given different numbers
by manufacturers who incorporate this feature, which not all the
aftermarket makers do).

I think it is cheaper to replace the entire antenae.  I could swear I bought
one for something like $65 dollars.  Check prices; Automotion, Performance,
Atlanta Porsche and Vertex.  Call Vertex last, as they usually have the best
prices and if not will typically match prices. No affiliation with Vertex,
just satisfied customer.
