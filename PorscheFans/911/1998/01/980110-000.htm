I agree with the suggestion that the most practical thing is to have a
body shop mix some touch-up paint for you.  If it's a metallic color it
will never be exact anyway.  

As for as the factory "Lackstift" touch-up tubes, their availability is
spotty at best, and in my experience no paint sold separately is an
exact match.

Re Mike Klein's doubts about using factory touch-up paint gone lumpy,
just add lacquer thinner a little at a time (use a small funnel if you
have one--if it spills over you'll ruin the finish on the tube and it'll
be useless in a concours!) and keep shaking.  If it's not too far gone
you can bring it back to usable consistency.  This is another advantage
of lacquer--you can't do this with enamels or urethanes.

Touch-up paints that are sold in small quantities, under factory labels
and the Dupli-Color label (at car washes, etc.), are characteristically
lacquers.  This is still true even though (in CA at least) body shops
can't use lacquer any more.  Lacquer dries quickly, can be sanded and
rubbed out, and has a long shelf life--all useful for touch-up
application.  

The urethanes that shops now use come a lot closer to the factory finish
and can be regulated as to shine (ranging from slick to orange peel,
depending on what's on the car).  The downside is that painting has to
be done by the panel, and both the paint and the process are more
expensive, hence the increases in insurance rates we've all
experienced.  The same paint in a small bottle will not last that long,
but while it does, it should match exactly.  That is, unless the color
is metallic, and then it'll never match anyway.
