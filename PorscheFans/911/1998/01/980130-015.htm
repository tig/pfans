I have a 1988 Porsche 944.I am an internaitonal student. I just came here
about 8 months. And
because of the language, I really need somebody to help me with my car.
About half a year ago, I couldn't start my car in the cold weather. And
what is worse is that sometimes when I was driving, the car just stopped
suddenly. When I shifted to Park, then I could start it again.
So I took my car to the dealer. They suggested I change the battery.
So I changed the battery and the car seemed to be O.K. again. Recently,
I can't start my car again.  Sometimes it does start, but after 2 seconds,
it quits.
Because I live in a small town in Kansas, if I can't start my
car, I can't drive it to the dealer. So could you give me some
suggestions?
Thank you very much.  Please reply directly to me.

Sincerely, Enoch
