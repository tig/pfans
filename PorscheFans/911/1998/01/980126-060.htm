To avoid damaging the outer visible part of the fender lip you can try 
to create the beginning of a crease halfway between the outer and inner 
portion with pliers.  Just put a shop cloth, or something in the jaws 
and work your way down along the fender.  Follow this with a wood bar, 
or the common baseball bat to do the "rolling".  BTW, rubbing usually 
takes place up around the 11 o'clock area on the d-side and 1 o'clock 
area on the p-side, if its going to happen at all.  Regular 16's for an 
'87 are 6" wide and they may not rub, even with lowering.

Hi P-Fans!
I was thinking of installing the "Club Sport" motor mounts on my 85 Carrera.
Oddly, these seem to be the same part number as the cabriolet mounts. Two
questions:  Besides the motor mounts, are there "club sport" transmission
mounts available, too, to complete the package?  Can the motor mounts be
replaced without dropping the engine, (by supporting the engine with
jackstands), or does the design of the mounts preclude this? 
One last thing, unrelated to this question. Could most of you on the list
"sign off" with your URL? At times it's difficult to fathom individual screen
names, for those of us who wish to reply directly, as well as to the list.
Thanks!
