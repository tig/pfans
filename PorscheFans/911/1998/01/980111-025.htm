The A032 is the tire most folks use here in San Diego. We've been selling them
with a heat cycling process that seems to be adding significantly to their
longevity. The only complaint i hear is the tires are somewhat noisy at
freeway speeds.

Many of us also drive R1's on the street. They seem to do well in water and
are quieter on the street. Definately a better performer on the track.

I would say the A032 would be my first choice. Of course the Bridgestone SO2
is a whole nother story.
