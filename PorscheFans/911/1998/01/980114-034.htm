I think it would be a great idea to give our kids (mine has 533 days to go to her license) the opportunity to learn to drive fast in a safe environment with an experienced driver talking them through a turn.  (As everyone knows, Dads are not experienced and when their mouths move, no sound comes out).

My daughter has cheerfully been going to track events for two years in hopes of a payoff when she turns 16.  I am no longer permitted to torque a wheel, check the looseness of the wheel bearings, adjust my seat belts, gas the car, check the oil, check the tire pressure, etc.

She has worked hard at learning about cars in general and the Porsche in particular.  We live in the mountains of Colorado and during my son's senior year in high school, nine of his class mates died needlessly on the local roads.  Three or four die every year.  The school's answer was to start a program that brings in a wrecked car and shows it to the kids to scare them.  Nothing is being done to increase the skill and awareness levels of the kids.

 If I have to, I'll spring for a high performance school.  However, I think doing it as part of a group of teens and as a part of the Porsche club would be a much richer experience for her than being in the only car on the track on a Tuesday.

Off my soapbox.
