I just picked up my 1983 911 SC (yay!) and have a few 
questions for the resident gurus.  The car is white and has a 
number of updates on the cosmetic side but is stock 
otherwise, with 95K miles on the clock.  I had a thorough 
checkout at a local (reputable) shop and would like to find 
if his estimates are too high.  I don't have the facilities 
(or knowledge) to do much (if any) engine/transmission work 
myself.

1)  I need to change the belts, but the car doesn't have a 
toolkit and thus the tool mentioned in the manual for holding 
the pulley..  Is there something I can use in lieu of this to 
hold the pulley?

2)  The big one.  I got this car for a steal ($12,700) so I 
figured this repair would still make the car a good deal.  
The transmission almost always grinds when trying to put it 
into first gear.  A drain of the tranny found three of the 
teeth off of a "dogtooth gear" (Synchro hubs?).  The mechanic 
thinks that I will need new sliding sleeves all around and at 
least a new "dogteeth gear" for 1st.  A new set of synchros 
was also included in the estimate.  Cost: $2209.10 including 
the 16 hours of labor.  I'm sure this is a little vague, but 
I don't know much about these things.  I guess my question 
is:  Is this a reasonable estimate?  I plan to price him out 
in the Dallas area before I commit.  

3)  As this is my first Porsche (read REAL sports car) the 
shifter sure has a lot of slop in it.  I don't remember it 
being so bad in the other cars I drove.  On my other car, you 
can tell that you are in gear because the shifter is very 
notchy.  This could be a product of the transmission problem, 
But I'm sure the bushings/couplers are suspect too.  any 
suggestions on how to inspect and diagnose a bad bushing and 
coupler?

4)  The Emmissions test came back with a CO % = 1.32.  It 
says that this is too high and that it could need an 
adjustment or it may be a bad catalytic converter/lambda 
sensor.  It does seem to run kinda rich.  How can I narrow 
this down?

5)  The fresh air blower doesn't work.  The light next to the switch 
comes on when the fan should, but there is no "breeze."  I haven't had 
time to check the motor, etc with the multi tester, but I guess I 
should find out where the motor is first!  

6)  The RH door brake is missing.  upon closer inspection, it looks 
like the sheet metal has sheared where it was mounted to the door.  I 
want to get this thing fixed.  What is the best (cheapest) course of 
action to take hear.  I'd rather not pay him $62.50/hr to do something 
I can get fixed elsewhere for less.

7)  Last thing:  the driver's seatbelt is "kinked"  It looks like I 
need to disassemble to take the kinks out.  Is this a DIY operation or 
do I need some special tools to remove it.  It is causing the belt to 
not retract correctly.

Sorry for the long message.  I just wanted to get all the questions out 
now, so I know what to expect.  I have to sell my other car, so I want 
to get the shop stuff out of the way while I have other means of 
transportation.

Thank You in Advance,

Chris Jares
