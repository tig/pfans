Hi Scott,
 A quick grep of my 911 "greatest hits" archives gave the following info on 
cruise control problems.  I hope this helps and that the people who originally 
posted these responses don't mind me copying their old Pfiles posts to the 
group.
				best regards,

Subject: Cruise Control Weirdness
I did not respond to this thread earlier because it seemed like a different 
problem, but maybe not. The cruise control in my '87 911 used to bleed off speed 
by about 0.5 mph/mile. It seemed like a vacuum leak type of thing, but the CC is 
not a vacuum type of system.  Unable to trace the problem to any obvious source, 
I eventually replaced the CC brain.  Works great now. I've heard about this same 
thing from a few other Carrera owners.  The CC system may be the same in the 
928.  In fact, the CC box has a 928.xxx. prefix for the porsche part number 
stamped on it. The CC brain is VDO manufactured electronics package.  A new one 
lists for $600.  I called around bone yards and found a salvage from Parts 
Heaven for $125.  I wanted to repair the one I have, (I suspect a bad transistor 
or something) but I cannot get an electrical schematic.  I also cannot find 
anyone who will repair VDO electronics. If anyone knows how to debug these 
things, let me know.  As mentioned, I think the problem is a simple failed 
transistor or thermister.  I've heard enough of this same problem that if we can 
publish a "solder a replacement X-component on the board" fix.  We may save a 
number of people lots of $$$.

Subject: 3.2 911 vacuum leaks
A friend asked me to fix his DME unit-it seems the idle was
jumping around and the cruise control no longer held a
steady speed.Before probing into the electronics i had him crank it up in      
order to observe the symptoms and check for obvious stuff like loose ground 
wires.  During the exam i found a cracked vacuum hose coming off the back side 
of the throttle.  There is a brass tube out the back of the rubber boot that 
runs to the left side of the engine toward the cruise control  'motor'.  At the 
end of the 12" long brass tube is a 2" long   piece of molded rubber hose, and 
this hose was cracked and  leaking air.  Its easy to find and fix.  Just replace 
the  rubber with hose from autoshack--Very cheap$$$.  Just for fun i checked my 
own and about 8 other 911s--and to  my surprise they were all cracked in the 
same place!  It looks like a case where the rubber has gotten hard and      
brittle.  Now, go out and check you rubber and let me know  what you find.

Probably the cruise control relay. Fairly common failure...
Good Luck!
