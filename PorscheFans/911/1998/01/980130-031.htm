I'm 6'8" tall, and just fit in my '92 C2 cab. In fact, I don't fit in the
coupes with sunroofs as they don't have enough head room. The cab has enough
headroom, but I could use just a bit more leg room. I have no problem driving
the car now, but an extra inch or so of legroom would be nice. 

So my question is, can the seat rails be moved back an inch or so to give just
a bit more leg room? Or is there an aftermarket seat rail that would acheive
the same thing? With my seat all the way back, there's still a couple of
inches behind the backrest before it would contact the rear compartment. I
have the 6 way adjustable electric seats.

Any other extra-tall P-fans out there that have addressed this?
