Gentlemen:  Thanks for variety of commentary/thoughts on 1/27/98 list re "gap"
problem when installing factory euro lowering springs(1.1") on rear of 993
(96).  Update/further clarification:  In "static" condition, U.S. spring  is
approx 1/2" Longer than Eibach 1" lowering spring ("pro-kit", not "sport-line
series).  Porsche Euro is approx 21/2"shorter than U.s.  I'm guessing that
"compression" issue is not  problematical, but "extension" (car jacked up, no
load), leaves approx 2" vertical movement of spring between upper and lower
perch, which creates potential "misalignment" problem when car jacked down.
ByDesign staff actively (heard thread) attempting to resolve concern (which
again they think is unwarranted).  Yes, a different shock (Higher perch) would
eliminate the gap, but car has 1K miles and am really not desiring to incur
expense for 4 "Euro-spec" shocks now.  Again, fronts fit fine, no problemo.
Suggestion by Johnson Alignment to "silicone adhesive" top coil to upper perch
to at least "attach/demobilize" upper misalignment, leaving lower perch to
deal with with dropping.  Talked with Eibach re: tender springs (Andrew, Fast
Forward)  but concern expressed with "interface" between "tender" spring and
Euro for "Noise/contact" which may occur.  Also, tender springs have 150lb.
rate, jiving with Euro rate, with uncertain/less than desirable consequences.
Has anyone experienced a problem with Eibach's "sagging" after time/use.
Sorry for this bandwith.  Am I too paranoid and should I just leave things as
they are "with gaposis" and hope for the best, install Eibach's, etc?  Ride
height looks great and don't want to "re-Americanize" after all this.  Thanks
all.  Van Larson @MAKASIM@aol.com
