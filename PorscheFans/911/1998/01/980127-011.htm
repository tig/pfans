     Hello P-nuts,
     
     Here's my problem:  I've had a 95 993 C2 which I've had since 
     July,1994. It's a daily driver with about 35,000 miles.  Several 
     months ago when I was having my rear tires replaced at my dealership 
     (I get 10,000 miles out of a rear set of Dunlop SP-8000s), I asked 
     them to do a four wheel alignment.  I was not having any real problems 
     with the car, just had been a while since it had been done.
     
     When I got the car back the wrench told me he had been unable to line 
     up the steering wheel at the "12 o'clock position."  To make a long 
     story short, I brought the car back two or three times because of this 
     problem as well as generalized vagueness of the steering on center.  
     I've come to the conclusion now that it's probably not a alignment 
     problem, but perhaps a rack or bushing problem.
     
     Here's what happens:  the car doesn't drift left or right. However, if 
     I make a hard left turn, the wheel doesn't come back to 12 o'clock, 
     but stays to the left of center (half a clock hour or so).  If I then 
     drive straight ahead for a few miles, it slowly returns to the  center 
     position.  If I make a hard right turn, the same thing happens: the 
     steering wheel stays slightly to the right of center (though not as 
     much as with left turns).  Mixed in with all this a a vagueness on 
     center that is very un-Porschelike.
     
     Any ideas as to what's going on?  Oh, one other thing:  after I had 
     the car about a year, the steering rack was replaced for a leak on 
     warranty. The cars has not been in any accidents or had any track 
     time. It is driven "enthusiastically" however.
     
     Regards,
     
     Neil Halvey
