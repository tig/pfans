A couple of things caught my eye here, the 77 came with a 2.7. if it does
have a 3.2 then you need to make sure that all the 3.2 smog equip is there.

If it has the orig 2.7 then ck to see if someone changed the fan to 11
blade fan. What kind of eng work has been done. Hopefully someone has
receipts for changing the head studs. 

Sounds like the steering rack is bad. This can be caused by accident,
especially if it seems to bind in one place.

If car is lowered then 6's in front with 7's in back.

What out for so calif cars as some are rebuilt wrecks. All we can say is
ALWAYS HAVE A PRE PURCHASE  inspection done by a PORSCHE mech.
