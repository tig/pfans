As I understand the axle business, basically there are 3 components
which all need to match.......the transmission flange, the axle assembly
and the stub axle in the trailing arm. You need to go all one way or the
other........you can't mix them. The different axles have different
diameters and splines so that the CV's are not interchangeable (if
memory serves me correctly)

Basically you need to replace the stub axles in the trailing arms with
your old ones (I believe they will fit, but if not I have my old set
which will and I am happy to sell....also a set of rebuilt 4 bolt
axles....but I digress). The only problem is that the stub axle is
retained with a large castellated nut  which is torqued to some 200 ft
lbs or so....probably beyond most impact wrenches to remove. There is
the problem that you need to keep the assembly from rotating while you
undo the nut, Porsche makes a retaining gizmo their shops use, but you'd
have to rig up something as the torque is enough to move the car forward
even over its parking brake and transmission in gear. Once the nut is
off, the sub axles should just slide out and you can then slide the old
ones in........

Hope this helps
