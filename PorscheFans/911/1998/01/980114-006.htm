     On Monday I received from Don Rosen Porsche my 8-volume set of 
     workshop manuals for the 993 series.  This set was straight
     from Porsche NA (even came packages in the cardboard box from Porsche 
     NA with part number stickers, etc.).  This set is NOT simply a Xeroxed 
     version of the manuals. It has two-sides pages and foldouts for 
     various figures including the wiring diagrams.  Comes complete with 
     labeled binders. 
     
     Don Rosen also offered the lowest price I've found so far - $287 and 
     they paid shipping and handling. They advertise in Panorama and their 
     web address is: http://www.donrosencomp.com/porsche/ 
     
     I am not associated with them in any way, but just wanted to let you 
     know about a good source for the manuals.  I spoke with Vince who is 
     the parts manager and he was EXTREMELY helpful. I can very highly 
     recommend them as a source for manuals for 993's.
     
     I can also note that the manuals do assume (as others have noted) a 
     basic familiarity with the car.  They are not as comprehensive as the 
     manual I have for my Jeep, but they do take some of the mystery out of 
     the way these beasts are put together.
