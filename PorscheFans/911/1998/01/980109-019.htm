Brian, my '87 is also Venetian Blue and I looked for touchup paint just a few
weeks ago.  I had the dealer research it a little and they found that it is
discontinued.  Other sources may still have it.  The dealer's recommendation
was to have a Porsche body shop mix some up for you.  They have the exact
recipe and apparently do this regularly.  I haven't checked with them.

BTW I bought the car relatively recently and the PO included the original
Porsche touchup paint but it's rather thick and lumpy, which is why I'm wary of
using it.

I purchased an 88 cab about a month ago.  I live in San Fran. so the majority
of my driving is stop and go.  I seem to be consuming oil at the rate of 1
quart every 250 - 300 miles.  There are no external leaks.  When I start the
car there is a puff of blue smoke (oil), but I am told that this is normal.
The smoke turns white for a few blocks, which I assume is normal condensation.
After that there is no smoke at all. The car rides perfect, acceleration in
every gear is quick and responsive, idle is very smooth.  I pulled the plugs
and they were completely clean, no evidence of oil fouling.  Is this just a
high oil consuming car, or should I have a leak down test done.
