I am writing to ask ALL the list members to remember 1 thing when
posting to these Porsche lists:

1. Send only ordinary text or browser-readable links to the list--
nothing else!!! 

A. Do not send pictures to the list!!! They don't come through to people
on the digest; instead we get many screenfuls of useless computer
gibberish!! The 2 alternatives are to send pictures directly to
individuals requesting the photos, or, if you have a web page- post a
link to the picture location in your message to the list.

B.Please turn off all that "multi part message in MIME format"-- it is
repetitive and not readable by the list software... The problem is that
the message is first delivered in plain text, then it is REPEATED (!!!)
with visible HTML (internet language stuff) crud. Here is an example
from today's digest: 

"From: "Ward Carter" <wardc@seanet.com>
To: <stephen_albers@milacron.com>
Subject: Seattle area Porsche Garage

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

Steve:  I have worked with Chris and Ted at Chris's German Auto in =
Bellevue (425-462-9296)  for the past several years.  Even though I =
enjoy doing most of the work on my 911, I let these guys do the "heavy =
lifting" that is beyond my abilities.  They have always done very high =
quality work at reasonable prices.  On several occasions, I've pulled in
=
for quick fixes or advice, and received same free of charge.  Chris is =
also active in the local Porsche club, has a sweet 911S,  and is a good
=
guy to get to know.
