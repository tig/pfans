Steve,
 Excuse me if this a stupid question but are
you sure the wheel bearings are loose? I ask
because I went through this a few years back.
In my case, the strut insert was loose in the
strut. To check this, grip the strut just below
the dust cover and push and pull to see if there
is any play.
  It has always bugged me that I get more movement
tugging on the front wheels of my 911 [your basic
wheel bearing check] than I do when I perform
the same test on my VW Rabbit. Perhaps someone
has some insight on why this is so? (Where the
movement comes from, not why it bugs me. <g>)
