 <<So the saga goes on.     Any ideas out there?  >>
 
 Symptoms of sportomatic problems:
 1. The car will shift reliably at about 1,000 rpm ( the sporto idles about
800)   
 2. If you shut the ignition off, you can easily shift into the gear of choice
1,2,3,R --  then restart and go.  Very inconvienient at a stop sign though you
can start out in 2nd.  (read here -no acceleration power).  
 3. The brakes seem to be somewhat defficient (though it has been a few years
since I had a Porshe, but this one is supose to have vacumn assisted brakes). 
 4. If you decelerate and stop very slowly, the problem is less severe.  
 
 Note, I verified the switches on the shift lever are working.  Though I have
not proven that the signal from the relay actually gets to Vacumn Control
valve (read here there may be an intermittend wire at the VCV.  Maybe this
explains why it works at 1,000 rpm if the engine is torqued and moving the
wires.   
 
 At any rate, I need help>>>

 <I just put a new servo unit in it - one of the (new)

 I would be interested in what this part # is and why it is different -- that
is was it changed to correct a problem?
 
 <I've got a spare servo too because they're becoming rare and very expensive
parts.  They used to be $AUD280 then they went up to $AUD420 and now they're
$AUD1,250 and you have to send your old part in and they send you a re-built
one and that all takes 5 weeks.  (What a nightmare!) >
 
 My part took about 1.5 weeks.  The parts department had verified it was in
stock and had it sent by express delivery.  By the way, the part was $804.00
USD
 
 I believe that this is the same part my dealer replaced.  It is cylindrical
with several vacumn ports on the bottom.  It is made by Bosche.  The
interseting thing is the shifting problem became worse with the new part.  
 
 This may tie in with the bad wiring idea. In other words, the intermittent
connection was worse because of the wire possitioning and handling.  I hope
they didn't send the part back to Germany.  
 
 Other ideas :
 1) A vacumn hose bent restrickting the action to the clutch
 2) A slow vacumn leak 
 3) A vacumn leak in the Vacumn Assist breaks and that is why it occurs when
stopped -- foot on break   
 
 They did find a intake manifold leak on #5 cylinder which was repaired.  I
expect to talk with the mechanic today (1-26-98).
