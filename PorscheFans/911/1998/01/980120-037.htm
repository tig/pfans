Jim Cunninghame asks about the proper procedure for dropping the
clutch on his 87.  Vol Spaulding cringes.  So do I.

The received standard wisdom is that dropping (or dumping or that even
more graphic description, sidestepping) the clutch on a 911 leads
promptly to dropping large sums of money on expensive repairs.  

I think it goes like this:  in big US V-8s the rear end is pretty light, so if you
sidestep the clutch you spin the rear tires, which is enormously
satisfying to the driver and impressive to onlookers, what with all the
noise and smoke from the tires.  Because of the weight distribution, the
tires spin pretty easily.  Because they are spinning, they are not working
very hard at propelling the car forward, and as a result the drive train is
not under all that much strain, and the available torque is being
harmlessly (discounting the tires) wasted until eventually the tires do
hook up at the end of the desired black streaks of your tires' rubber on
the pavement, at which time the car is going fast enough that the system
can handle the torque.

Our cars have all that weight over the rear tires (60% of it, more or less).
 Absent water or sand on the pavement, the tires don't spin under
acceleration, because we don't have NASCAR power levels allowing us
to light them up almost at will.  In short, they hook up pretty well.  If you
rev the engine up to what - 3, 4, 5,000 rpm, and sidestep the clutch, you
put a huge load on everything because all that torque (4-5,000 would be
at torque peak for many of our cars) is being almost instantly applied.  So
you stand a good chance of breaking something in your transmission, or
maybe even in your engine.  Turbos have larger CV joints because they
are needed to handle their extra power.  I suppose axles could break, or
bad things (other than wear) could happen to clutch components (look at
what transmitts the torque from the outer housing attached to the
flywheel to the pressure plate some time). 

I think this lore may have started with the 901 style transmission in use
from 64-71, where the first gear hung out there on a shaft with a bearing
only on one side, and breaking the shaft there by overexuberant drag
race starts was not unknown.  Expensive part to break, both for parts
and labor.  Makes replacing a clutch look like peanuts.

Whether this remained true with the 915 and your G-50 transmission,
where first wasn't cantilevered I don't know from personal experience.

Nor do I intend to find out.

I have a suggestion for you, however.  Others on this list have driven
more 911s than I (the lucky dogs) and longer (I've been at it since 1984),
but my experience is long enough, I think.  The clutch disk I put in in about
1986 or 7 I just measured, and it is close enough to the wear limit that I
am going to replace it, though I could get more out of it.  So my methods,
while perhaps not the best, can't be too bad for a daily driven car which
also sees autocross, driver's ed, and Club Race use.  

Start your 911 like you would any car with a clutch - rev it up a bit, ease
the clutch out and match things with a bit more gas as needed until it is
rolling and fully engaged, then do whatever you want.  Clutch will live,
drivetrain will live, tires will live, etc.  You won't be slow off the line at
the stop lights either.

Where there is a viable reason to increase your initial launch speed, as
at the start of most autocrosses, nothing particularly bad seems to
happen if you start as you usually would on the street, just with a bit
higher initial rpm and a bit quicker easing out of the clutch.  In essence,
you are slipping the clutch more to get the rpm at full engagement up
higher in the torque range.  This isn't doing the clutch (and flywheel and
pressure plate) surface any particular good, but given the relatively few
times you do this, it doesn't look like it dramatically reduces the life of
these components.

What rpm, you ask?  Well, I think most do it by sound.  Maybe one of the
more thorough autocrossers has paid more attention and can enlighten
us.  But I don't think anyone "dumps" their clutch.
