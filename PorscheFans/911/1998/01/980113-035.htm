5:  The PO put a headliner with out the sunroof access and did a crappy
job too boot.  How hard is it to do a headliner and any advice on the
proper techniques?



To install a headliner in a non-sunroof car, the most important part is 
to remove all windows, rear glass, and probably also the windshield (my 
windshield was already out, I'm not sure if I could have done the 
headliner with it in).  Only then can you access the spaces you need to 
work in.

Get an adhesive such as the 3M General purpose adhesive that comes in 
large (kinda expensive) spray cans, and some thin matting which can be 
obtained from any Walmart or fabric store.   You'll need 2 or 3 cans, if 
I recall properly.

Remove or completely cover all of your interior, unless you want to drip 
the adhesive onto your carpet or seats.  Believe me you don't, because 
it is a bear to get off.

The adhesive gets tacky in about 1-2 minutes, so spray it on the piece 
of the matting you plan to attach, and to the roof.  Glue the matting in 
place first.  It will give a sense of how to work with the adhesive 
before you start on the headliner.

Perhaps someone who has done this on a sunroof car has some other 
suggestions.  Good Luck!
