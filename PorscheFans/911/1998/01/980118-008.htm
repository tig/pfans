After taking a month of leave, I'm back and finally got to working on my
'79 SC again (for a quick refresher, it would run smoothly for about a
minute then died).  I pulled the MSD ignition I had installed and put a
rebuilt CD ignition back on.  It had no effect, but at least I could now
take it to Bosch to have it fixed (the first time I took it to them they
told me it was the MSD's fault, I needed to put the Bosch ingition back
on).  So I towed it over there again, and after running tests for awhile
they started messing with the fuel to air mixture, found it was way off,
and got it running.  It ran fine in the shop, and I drove it home.
Finally, it ran.  However, I soon noticed that it was not idling well at
all.  It would idle around 1000, fall to 400, and surge back, repeating
this continuosly.  To warm up the car before adjusting the mixture, they
just let it idle for around 20 minutes.  The temp gauge had not moved.
Was the car not warm enough, therefore the mixture is still off?  I've
read before that too rich will cause surging.
