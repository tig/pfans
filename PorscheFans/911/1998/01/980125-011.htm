Hi Ed:

   Our input on spark plug wires, plugs and related ignition
woes..........

  IMHO, save your money regarding the purchase of Nology wires. We have
had excellent luck with using: Bosch OEM wire sets, Magnecor wire sets,
and building our own as necessary. There is no advantage to Nology wires
if the existing wires and plug connectors are in good working order.

  In our experience with 911's, one thing truly causes some random
misfires and other running difficulties is intermittent spark plug
connectors. These connectors feature a small resistor inside them for
RFI supression that very frequently, goes bad. A quick check with a good
ohmeter will reveal this. You must unscrew the connector from the end of
the plug wire to accurately measure this value. You should see
approximately 2K of resistance. If its open, you can buy new
connectors(expensive!) instead of a whole wire set. This is a common
malady that everyone should check when strange misfires and seemingly
lack of full power start to manifest themselves. After you have
purchased several of these connectors, one will begin to appreciate the
Magnecor wires. They use their own proprietary connectors with no
resistor and 6K ohms-per-foot wires.

Replacing these connectors is a regular maintenance item. :^(

Spark plugs: Everyone here has their favorites, one should use what they
have the best luck with, we use Bosch Silver, and NGK V-series with
excellent results. While not the cheapest plugs available, they offer
long life and good-running characteristics over a wide range of
conditions. We also use the old-style Bosch Platinums but they are
frightfully expensive. In some applications, they are the only way to
go.

Ed, I hope this helps you a little..............:^)
