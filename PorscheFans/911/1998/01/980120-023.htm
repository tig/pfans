Hi Adnan.  They are junk...I saw a program on TV about them (it was one of
those late night news shows, either 20/20, Dateline, or 60 Minutes).  They
showed how great they worked when the radar gun was without about 10 feet, but
anything over that and they didn't do a thing.  I don't remember the name of
the company that was selling them.  I think they were based in Colorado.  The
company also had the "we'll pay any tickets you get up to 15 mpg over the
speedlimit" guarentee, which the company refused to comment on how many they
had paid.

I'd recommend getting a good radar detector like the Valentine One
(http://www.valentine1.com).
