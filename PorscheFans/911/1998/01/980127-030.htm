Scott:

I used a set of Toyos this year on my 944 and was very pleased with their
performance AND their wear rate.  I got them about 1/2 used, basically
"thrown in" with a set of wheels I bought (thanks Kevin).  Ran very close
to the same lap times as my Hoosiers!  I plan to buy 2 more sets this year
(1 for SCCA, as there is a little contingency $, and another for DE events
and race practices where I don't care if I lose 1/2 second).  I will still
use the Hoosiers to qualify and race.

Note that my car is set up with a fair amount of negative camber and is
strictly a race car.  I have always run R1's on my 911 (also an '87) and
for a combination street/track car they are probably a better idea.  A good
allignment for the Toyos/Hoosiers would eat up your street rubber.

Just one guys opinion.... any others?

Best Regards,

Joe Rothman
