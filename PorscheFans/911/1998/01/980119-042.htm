Hi Ron;

There are a couple of areas you will want to focus some attention on.
These include the following areas:

- First, where your suspension ties into the belly pan near the fuel
tank.  This should be solid and without rust;

- Also, where the rear suspension (trailing arms) tie into the rear
supports - the areas near the support (rear longitudinal areas) need to
be solid as well;

- The floorpan *is* an integral part of the suspension, body - well,
entire car, so be sure that this was not simply brazed into place, but
rather, is properly welded.  I suggest you have the welds inspected by a
professional;

- As you probably know, the rear torsion bar tube is prone to rusting
out (from the inside out due to condensation) - check to be sure that
this is intact and not ready to break....

Finally, to add additional stiffening, you can have a cage welded in,
which will add both weight and chassis stiffness - but that would be
optional on your part.

I'm sure others will add to my list - but in the meantime, the areas
above should keep you busy for a while checking them out :-)

To all,

I haven't had a chance to post to the list in several months, but you can
advertise Porsches and Porsche related items (parts, literature, wanted, etc)
in PML for free. Our magazine comes out monthly and goes to a very targeted P-
car audience. Ads need to be to us by Jan 25th to be in the Feb issue which
will mail around the 10th of Feb. You can email them.

Thanks and regards,

Phil Van Buskirk, PMLetter@aol.com

Best one in my opinion is the Valentine One.  I have had mine for a few
years, and am still happy with it.  The directional arrows and the counting
fearture have saved me a few times; sensitivity has also helped as I get
a warning of a signal bounced off car several hundred feet away from me.

Also what has saved me more than once besides the radar detector is
a CB radio.  This has been my main deterrent against instant-on radar
on a highway with light traffic; detector wouldn't have helped in these cases.

------------------------------------

I just bought a new C2 993 Cabriolet last week. I would like to buy a radar
detector. Does anyone have any recommendations.

Any recommendations on caring for the car (wash/waxing etc.).

Thanks, Elia
