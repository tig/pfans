From yesterday's post about MIG welders/ welding - here`s my .02 worth.
I  purchased my Mig welder from Daytona Mig (advertises in a lot of
enthusiast type mags, just happens to manufacture in my home town). For
my uses,  (mainly sheet metal repair and patches on a restoration
project) it seems to work very well.  The model I got was the Pocket
Turbo 130 which sold for $509 with a full 40cu` bottle of C02/Argon gas.
When you are shopping be sure to find out about the gas, because some of
the wire feed welders are designed for flux core wire and have optional
gas kits.  This unit has plenty of power for sheet metal repairs, in
fact I have to use it on it`s lowest setting for that type of work.
Daytona offers 120v and 240v units mine is 120 (picked for convenience
of operation and portability) I have used it for repairs other than
sheet metal such as repairing broken office furniture and such, but not
for anything really structural so I can`t comment on suitability for
chassis repairs and such   
(manufacturer claimed uo to 1/4 inch steel capability).  
  The learning curve was short, I was making decent beads after an hour
or so of playing around. The hardest thing is getting a feel for the
power setting and wire speed necessary for a given job. When I`m getting
ready to weld, I usually grab some scrap of similar gauge to set up on
before I go to my project. One recommendation,  get a unit with
infinitely
variable speed and if affordable, power settings. I find that the wire
speed is critical for a smooth weld and the variable knob on my machine
comes in handy. I do wish that mine had a fully adjustable power setting
instead of the click type knob that it came with.  Another thing that I
found helped me alot was an automatic helmet. The normal technique
involves flipping up the helmet, lining up the gun for the weld,
flipping down the helmet and starting. Since you can`t see anything
through the lens until the arc is started, I always ended up moving and
missing my start point. With the automatic helmet, you leave it down all
the time and the lens goes dark as soon as the arc starts-much easier
for a beginner! 
     As far as mig verses stick welding, no comparison at least for body
work. Point and shoot ease of use, no slag, very tiny beads are
possible, less warping of panels etc. The only advantage of stick type
welders as far as I could tell would be cost. 
   As far as aluminum though I`m not sure mig is what you want. I`ve
never tried it with mine, but I have friend that did with a much more
expensive Snap-On machine without much luck. To get a smooth feed with
the aluminum wire, it takes a handle mounted spool gun and  also I
believe a more expensive pure argon or helium gas. Even with the
upgrades to his machine he never got a decent bead. He ended up selling
it and purchasing a TIG machine which he loves.  
    A good primer for beginners is Ron Fourniers` "Metal fabricators
handbook"  from HPBooks. I found it useful for not only welding tips but
sheet metal fabrication as well.  One final note if you do decide on
home welding- invest in a good fire extinguisher preferably CO2 so you
wont be afraid to use it because of the mess. Don`t ask why I make a
note of this!! 
    Hope this helps you do -it-yourselfers 
like me out there (sorry for the bw)

on instead of playing on the computer)
