Hi Pfans,

The search for my dream 911 began today with the test drive of a '79 
SC.  The experience was, well,  somewhat... disappointing.  People on the 
list have advised me to drive lots of prospects and educate myself, 
so when I come across the right car, I'll know it.

I'm still in need of a lot more education.  Specifically, in the determination 
of "ball park" fair market value.  Prices vary pretty widely - as do 
the condition of the cars - but there doesn't seem to be much 
correlation between value and condition.  Guess it's an imperfect 
market.  I've pretty much ruled out this '79 SC for various reasons, 
but I'm wondering what people on this list, who presumably have their fingers 
on the pulse of the market, think this car's worth.  Here are the 
details:

83k orig. miles (believed to be correct); factory sunroof; NO carrera tensioner 
update; short shift kit; whale tail; new tires (off brand); new tie rod ends; 
orig. shocks (ugh!); A/C completely removed by knucklehead PO who thought 
he'd gain big hp by removing it (present owner still has all pieces); new 
exhaust system; clutch within last 20k mi or so; genuine vinyl 
interior in pretty nice condition; paint looks good from 15 feet away 
but seems to have been selectively redone (some panels nice, others very 
dull - some with bubbles here and there); body seems nice & straight (doesn't 
obviously appear to have been hit);  big tear in headliner; turn signals don't 
work at all; idle is nice and even; engine seems string, yielding good but not 
neck snapping acceleration.

What do you think this "little honey" is worth?

One particularly troubling thing I noticed is that when I pushed the 
clutch pedal to the floor (as recommended by the seller), more often 
than not, I got grinding when trying to shift into 1st.  This was avoided 
only when I really jammed the pedal to the floor hard.  Is it normal 
to have to push the clutch pedal down to the floor like that?  Is 
the clutch in need of adjustment? Or is this an indication that the
sychros are going or of some other problem?  Please enlighten me.

Thanks in advance for all the advice.

Gary
