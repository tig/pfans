    Well, Steve approved of my PIAA lighting recommendation last
    week, so I guess it's my turn to second one of HIS
    recommendations.

    The drivetrain in my 914 is just as Steve described... The
    engine has 2.7 Euro Carrera RS pistons and cylinders, S cams,
    Webers, headers, and the transmission has short gears -- AA, F, L,
    S, and X. 

    The short gears really DO make an incredible difference.  With
    the stock 914-4 gearing (A, F, N, V, ZD), it was difficult to
    keep the engine in the powerband and it just didn't feel that
    fast... With the short gears, the 250-HP 914 feels faster than
    my 290-HP NSX.
