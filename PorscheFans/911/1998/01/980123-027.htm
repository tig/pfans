I am having a problem with my 1973 911T with CIS injection. 

The car starts fine when it is cold or when I just shut it down.  The
difficulty comes when the car has sat for about 1/2 to 2 hours and I try to
restart it.  I did not use to have this problem, but it has steadly gotten
worse over the last six months.  Now when I start my car when it is warm it
is not uncommon for it to take 6-10 trys.  When I try to start the car it
sounds like it is trying, the engine may turn over 5 times itself before it
dies. I have tried every combination of the gas pedal and hand trottle that
I can think of.  When I finally do get it started, it acts like I have
flooded it and sputters for a while until the extra gas is cleaned out,
then it runs fine.

To start the engine when it is cold, I merely pull up on the hand trottle
(no pedal) and turn it over, it usually starts on the first try and always
by the second.

I would appreciate any suggestions which you all may be able to give me,
thank you.

Keith
