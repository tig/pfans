In response to several e-mail queries about my recent post regarding he new
BFG g-Force T/A  R1 tire, the article in the Team  T/A newsletter only
metioned the initial availability of sixteen 14-, 15- and 17-inch sizes.
Since 16-inch wasn't mentioned, I assume this size won't be available
initially. The article states that both the new g-Force R1 and the current
generation R1 will be sold concurrently until BFG is able to fully ramp up
production of the new g-Force tire. I would guess that 16-inch sizes as well
as more of the other sizes will become available over that time.

BFGs' racing director, Dave Sanders, stated that they are "not yet in a
position to announce (exactly) when the new tire will be available by
individual size." He advises that if your competition season starts early in
1998, you'll be well advised to secure your tire needs with the existing
Comp T/A R1.

Other tidbits from the newsletter: "The g-Force T/A R1 provides faster
turn-in, better braking, faster and more consistent lap times, and is
generally more precise. In terms of tire construction, the g-Force (tire) is
closely related to a true rcing slick..." It is an entirely new design and
is not compatible with the current R1.

With only 3/32 of an inch tread depth, it sounds as though with this tire,
for those of us who drive our R1-shod cars to the track, we'll be pulled off
to the side of the road if caught in a down pour.  But in the dry, we'll be
stickier than a special prosecutor investigating a randy president.

Pray for spring,

Dave Andersen
