John:

  Your post here caught my eye about enlarging a 2.7 to 2.9 litres.

You might want to think that one over quite carefully before spending
that kind of $$$. The cylinder base diameter is the same as the
2.7(90mm) cylinders. These 93mm cylinders are VERY thin and are prone to
warpage. This leaves very little precious metal at the cylinder spigots
and the head sealing surfaces.
Even the 2.8 conversions(92mm) had some difficulty with head sealing due
to the thin mating surface and the higher compression ratio.

Its our opinion that the 2.9 litre conversion makes too many compromises
in potential engine life using the magnesium case to be an acceptable
solution.
The 2.7 RS (90mm) cylinders with higher compression pistons works quite
well in adding more torque throughout the RPM range without creating a
bigger reliability problem. Custom JE pistons can be made with any
compression ratio you want for the Nikasil cylinders, this allows you to
possibly use your existing cylinders as long as they are serviceable.

(Alusil cylinders can be used as well, they do take more machine work
and need the Nikasil coating, altogether not cheap)

Hope this helps you........
