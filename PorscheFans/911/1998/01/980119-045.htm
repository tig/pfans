Will:

If your tach is like mine, this'll be real easy...

1.  Pull the tach out of the dash... It's just held in by a 
    friction-fit rubber collar.

2.  Carefully unplug all the wires from the back of the tach, noting 
    where each one goes so you can put them all back on later.

3.  The bulb sockets will probably have come out of the tach as you 
    were trying to unplug the wires; if they haven't, remove them 
    now.

4.  Take the burnt-out bulb to your local auto-parts store and buy a
    replacement.

5.  Installation is the reverse of the removal procedure.
