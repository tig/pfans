Pop the rear seats down,  unscrew the two leather snaps, find the two
other screws, remove them,
carefully pull the assy out.   (its been a while I thought there was
four, just find them in the deck.

I replace all 4 speakers with some boston acoustics a while back.

There is little to no space available for anything with decent size
magnets/coils, you will see when you pull the deck out.

There are places that sell you a new deck with speakers,   you lose
visibility out the back...
