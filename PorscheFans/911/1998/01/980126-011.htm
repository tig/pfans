Regarding the Rolex 24 accomodations. The hotels closest to the track are
all booked. Hampton, Holiday Inn. La Quinta may have two or three rooms
left. On the beach you can find prices anywhere from $30 up. Most are clean
but you know going in that you are not staying at The Ritz-Carlton. On the
beach The Thunderbird has always been a good hotel as well as The Seaside.
Reasonable prices which triple in price next week when the NASCAR circus
arrives.

BTW, Champion's GT1 arrived over the week-end. They are trying to test it at
Moroso Tuesday and then go to Daytona. It would be an incredible story if
they were to win the race outright.

>One important issue with valve covers is to avoid over tightening the nuts.

>Subject: High Idle for 930 fixed!
>
>** Hello and thanks for all of the assistance with the high idle problem
>with my '79 930.  It turned out the problem was actually two-fold and I
>wanted to share the solution as there have been several people that had
>similar problems with their 930.
>
>A quick recap:  My car would normally idle at 1200-1500rpm even when the
>engine was warmed up and driven for an extended period.  After the engine
>got warm and was shut off, the idle jumped to 2500-3000 rpm upon restart.
>With my dual 4" rolled custom exhaust pipes the noise was very noticeable.
>
>The solution:  We found that the old throttle body had a small hole in it
>which screwed with the air/fuel mix.  So we replaced that and then we found
>that the auxiliary air valve needed to be replaced (thanks Dave Cooley for
>that tip) which cured the high idle when the engine was warm problem.  Now
>the car is at a nice 800 rpm idle.
>
>This list is great and I hope to contribute more as my experience expands.
>
>** I have another annoying problem, which I hope someone out there can
>assist me with.  The fuse that protects the left side parking lights and
>the hood light keeps popping when I turn the lights on in my car.  The only
>wires that are connected to the fuse is a moderately thick red one.  Is
>there a quick way to find out what is causing the short?  The P.O. had
>installed a hack job of a fuel cutoff switch with lots of electrical tape
>and duct tape all over the footwell.  I was thinking that this could be the
>problem, but even after disconnecting and disassembling the unit the fuse
>still pops when the lights are turned on.  After first glance, the wiring
>for both front and rear lights look good.  Any ideas?
