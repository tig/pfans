> Most bang for your buck is equal length headers like SSI's.  I don't
> know of a way to successfully modify your CIS injection for more
> performance.  The throttle body mods you see are for EFI cars and
> usually include a chip change and again I don't have direct knowledge
> of how effective they are.  You could change out the CIS for something
> like Webbers and take advantage of a different cam grind. This mod is
> outlined in Bruce Anderson's book. You could also change out the CIS
> for an EFI setup with programable controler but if you can do this for
> less than the cost of a 3.2 complete let me know.   You would probably
> need to change pistons if you changed the cams to anything aggressive.
> Best overall performance upgrade for the money I could think of would
> be to swap in a 3.2 with SSI's.  That assumes you don't have to
> rebuild the 3.2.   In my case my 75 weights in at 2,552 lbs stock.
> With the rebuilt engine and SSI's its a joy to drive on New England's
> rural roads and I can't imagine needing more power at least on a
> public right of way.  On your wheels, try masking them with 3M
> striping tape, sometimes referred to as "fine line" tape.
