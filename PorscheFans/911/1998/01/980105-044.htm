Hello to all....I am looking at buying a 911.  I thought I might ask this
goup what you think before I purchase one.  I also have a Chevy Impala which
is modified and I belong to the Impala list server.  I know how much help
that goup can be so I thought I should watch this list for a while before
purchasing.  This will be a little long so skip now if you are not
interested in my questions.
I am looking for a car from 35k to 50k and any year from 89-93 or 94.  I
have been looking at a few 89 911 Turbo's but they are about 45-55k.  I
found performance numbers that put them at about 5.4 seconds to do 60 mph.
I believe a 911 C2 will do 0-60 in about 5.5 seconds...atleast those are the
numbers I have found on paper...I am not sure in real life.  Anyway...it
seems like I have to pay an extra 10k or more for about one tenth in the
0-60 run.  I have also been looking at C2 cabs from 90-94 and I really like
the RS America.  This will be my second fun car and do not care about
creature comforts.  I want the car to be fast....real fast.  My Impala is
pretty fast and I want this car to blow its doors off.  I do not want to
lose any street races to SS Camaros or Ford Cobras.  The Impala can keep up
with them now...it also can keep up if not beat a 80's 911...this is not a
flame...I just want you to know what kind of  speed I am looking for.
Does anyone have information about 1/4 mile times and 0-60 times for
Porsches in the years I have mentioned above?  Real numbers would be
appreciated if anyone has taken theirs to the track.  I realize that part of
the fun of the Porsche is how well it handles as well as how fast they are
but on the real life road most races are straight away....I know the car can
handle.  My fiancee just bought a 911 C2 targa and I love it...the only draw
back is the tiptronic....good for her but takes away from the fun factor and
my Impala is as fast as her car because of the tiptronic.
Any thought on what to look for as far as problems, good dealers and whether
the extra dollars for the turbo are worth it would be sincerely appreciated.
I am willing to travel to get a clean car at a reasonable price.
Thanks in advance...I look forward to your responses!
Take Care,
Brian Leach
