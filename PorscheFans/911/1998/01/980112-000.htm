As this is my first message to the list, an introduction is in order.

I live in Singapore and purchased my Guards Red 1991 Carrera 4 (model code
964) just 3 weeks ago.  However, I travel extensively to the US where I can
be as much as 30% of my time, mostly in the Seattle WA and Bay Areas, which
is my reason for subscribing to this list. Needless to say, I am enjoying
the car very much and as a bonus, it has also received my wife Janet's
blessing as she is able to enjoy the car too, unlike some previous cars I
have owned!

Having received the daily digest for 2 weeks, I am impressed firstly by the
administration of the list by PorscheFans for being reader-friendly and
being able to offer options necessary for a list which is bound to have a
large following. I am also impressed by the content which does "stay with
the subject" better than many other lists I have subscribed too.

As for my question, now that my wife and I enjoy driving our C4 very much,
we would also occassionally like to share this with our 1 year old son
Giles. No amount of coaxing could I get his current car seat (Evenflo Ultara
V) into the back seats securely. I would like to seek the advice or
experience of anyone on the list on how I may get a child seat to fit, or
suggest a suitable child seat that will.

Many thanks.

Best regards,
Kenny Heng
