   Sorry if this is a repeat, have had some problems with list. I`ve got
a `77 911 that I picked up from a GSA auction. The car has  a non-stock
turbo motor that appears to me to be of `78-79 vintage.  The engine has
the serial #  6281532 and 930/04 type. My only reference source (Bruce
Anderson`s Performance Handbook) shows this as a `78-`79 3.0L normally
aspirated SC motor. If this is correct, why the "930" part #?  If this
is indeed a non-turbo motor, what problems might I be in for?  I assume
some parts were upgraded in the turbo motors. I would imagine the
pistons at very least would have needed to have been changed to lower
the compression ratio.  I checked the compression while I was trying to
get it running (bad fuel pumps from sitting way to long in impound) and
found all cylinders to be around 110 to 120 pounds. Is this normal for a
turbo?  The turbo setup appears to be OEM (intercooler, turbo, exhaust,
boost gauge in tach etc.)  
so I wonder if this was pirated from yet another  3.3L car.  Are there
any external clues to tell displacement?  Am I going to be better off
tearing it down to see what I have?

Considering the possibilities of a leak, I would recommend replacement.
I think they are designed to crush once; after that, they don't have the 
original flexilbility.

I wonder, however, about the need for adjusting valves 3 times a year??
My experience in 150,000 miles on a '76 and 130,000 miles in an '84
911 was that in between the 15,000 mile valve adjustment periods, the
clearances hardly changed.  Don't know what mileage interval you are 
doing them, but it might be going overboard.  15K miles between oil
changes (by the book) might be absurd, but same mileage between
valve adjustments I think is reasonable.

Just curious to find out if other list members think it's necessary to
change valve cover gaskets everytime you do valve adjustment.  I end up
doing this task about 3 times a year and many times the old gaskets
don't look too bad.  What about it Walt?
