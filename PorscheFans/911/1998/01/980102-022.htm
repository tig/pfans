I seem to have a problem where my battery will drain and go dead if I do =
not drive my 911 daily. I had a dealer check it out and he could not =
find any problem. I replaced the battery with a new Optima battery =
thinking the cells were bad in the Sears Die Hard battery the previous =
owner had installed. One key point. When I recharge the battery the =
interior ceiling lights comes on and stays on unless I manually turn off =
the light. I am perplexed by this current drain and where it might be =
that it causes the battery to go dead after several days of non use. I =
even started the car yesterday and ran the engine for about 15 minutes =
just to be sure the battery stayed charged. I would not drive it due to =
ice and snow conditions. It started fine yesterday....today it seemed to =
lack the current to turn over so I am recharging the battery. Your =
thoughts on this mystery appreciated. Thanks.
