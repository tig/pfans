I have an old home that had a dirt floor in the garage/basement area.  I
just finished pouring a concrete floor.  I was told to wait at least 30
days before painting the floor, which I did.  I used UGL Concrete Floor
Paint from Home Depot.  I am very happy with the way it came out.  I
brushed on the first coat pretty heavy and let it dry 5 hours.  Then I
recoated with a roller.  I don't think I spent more than 3 hours actually
painting.  I went on very easy.

If the floor is new, there is no prep needed.  But on a floor with some oil
or grease, you should scrub the dirty areas with TSP (Tri Sodium
Phosphate), also available at home depot, or muriatic acid (don't know
where to get this).

I'm really happy with the way it came out.  It's easy to keep clean now and
gives a brighter appearance in the garage.  Since I just did it, I can't
really comment on how it holds up over the long run.
