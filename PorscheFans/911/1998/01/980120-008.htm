Alexander,

 I had loose mirror problems on my '89 Carrera similar to yours, where the base 
is tight but the upper mirror assembly is loose.  The way I fixed it was:

1. Gently pull the mirror off its base. It may seem tight at first if the mirror 
has not been removed for the life of your car.
2. There are 3 or 4 phillips head screws that hold the guts of the electric 
mirror assembly to the outer shell of the side mirror.
3. The electric mirror assembly will now be hanging by the wires that control
the motors of the mirror.
4. You should now see a couple more phillips head screws that were previously 
covered up by the guts of the electric mirror assembly.  They may seem tight 
already, but I found that backing them out a couple turns then retightening them 
solved my loose mirror problem.  NOTE: there is another kind of loose mirror 
problem that is caused when the nut that holds the hollow tube the wires feed 
through comes loose. Automotion makes a kit to fix it for ~US50.  Luckily this 
was not the cause of my problem.
5. Installation is reverse of above.

The driver side mirror is very loose. The base is tight but the upper half is 
loose. Does anyone know how to disassemble the mirror to tighten it???
