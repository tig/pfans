Hi,
I am interested in taking Driver Ed through the IL PCA (Which I just
joined). I have a few novice questions, hope someone can help me with
them.
Equipment 911SC 1978
Tires - Dunlop D40M2's (215/rear, 205/front) on 15" Fuchs.  

1) Currently my SC is missing a rear Sway bar, I plan to have one
installed soon, but want to know how much of a difference this makes in
doing a Driver's Ed.
2) My tires are OK. They have good tread on them, but they are not new,
is it worth it to buy new tires before the event?
3) I have standard seat belts, do I need any add-ons. If so, from where?
4) Where do I get a good Helmet for the Driver's Ed?
5) I plan to have my brakes checked and bled before the event.
6) I have high idle on my SC. Would that make a difference?
Any other consideration I need to take before I sign up for an event?
Thanks in advance.
