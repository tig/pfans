Hi Porschefans,
I need some advice on torsion bars size for my 930 Ruf BTR 82. Current
size is stock (18.8 ft, 26 rear) and sway bars size is 22 front, 21
rear. I am planning on installing 22-28 torsion bars combo. Will the car
still be driveable on country road and would this be hard and balanced
enough for 390 BHP for track events. Car is equipped with polygraphite
suspension bushings and rigid motors mounts. Wheels are 9-10/17 Ruf with
235/40 in front and soon 285/35 rear. I do not intend to use slick tires
but SO2 (R1 not available in France) and would like (especially my
wife...) the car to be still driveable for road trips. Thank for your
advice.
P. Verdier

=0AHi Ron,=0AThere=92s supposed to be a steel plate/bracket that has prov=
isions to support=0Athe factory muffler. It attaches to the rear crossbar=
 using 2 bolts/nuts=0Adirectly in line with the crankshaft pulley. Part n=
o. is 901.111.151.04. If=0Ayou want a look see I can fax you a picture fr=
om the parts manual.=0A=0ASherwood Lee=0A69 911=0A=0A<<The stainless exha=
ust with a single 3.5" outlet finally came from=0APerformance Prod and it=
 is a beauty. Together with the SSI's the exhaust=0Asystem is a work of a=
rt. I am replacing an after market system that the=0Aprevious owner insta=
lled. There is no place to attach the muffler bands=0Aremaining on my eng=
ine. Could someone on the list describe the hangers that=0Athe bands atta=
ch to? Is the hanger a separate piece? If so where does it=0Aattach? I de=
finitely do not want the entire weight of the muffler supported=0Aby the =

You are one fortunate fellow. When you disconnected the air bag connector=
 with=0Athe ignition switch ON, I thought you meant =93What I discovered =
the hard way=0A.....=94 was that the air bag deployed - but instead you s=
aid the air bag=0Awarning light stayed ON. You could have received one se=
rious headache doing=0Awhat you did. I=92m not familiar with the specific=
s of Porsche=92s recommendations=0Aregarding air bag connectors, but ever=
y other manufacturer I=92m familiar with=0Arecommends you disconnect both=
 battery cables first, then wait a period of=0Atime (3-10 minutes) before=
 working on the SRS system. There is a danger of=0Aaccidental deployment =
- in your face. This is not a system you want to messing=0Awith unless yo=
u're aware of the precautions.=0A=0ASherwood Lee=0A69 911=0A=0A<<Recently=
 one of you gave me excellent instructions on how to remove a C4 =0Asteer=

 the block after fixing the turn signal switch to make sure the wheel =0A=
was straight) as it affects the airbag warning light which then has to be=

Here=92s a section from California=92s Bureau of Auto. Repair (BAR) websi=
te that I=0Afiled away sometime in 1997:=0A=0AWhat if I have problems get=
ting my 1966-74 Porsche to pass Smog Check? =0A=0AAfter researching this =
problem, the Bureau of Automotive Repair discovered=0Athat some 1966-1974=
 Porsches may be unable to meet the 2500 rpm emissions=0Astandard because=
 of the original design of the vehicle's emissions control=0Asystems. Whe=
n the Bureau developed the new emissions standards, every effort=0Awas ma=
de to ensure that no specific class of vehicle would be adversely=0Aimpac=
ted. However, upon further evaluation, the Bureau discovered a small=0Anu=
mber of vehicles that may have difficulty meeting the new standards. =0A=
=0ATo rectify this problem, the Bureau has revised the emission standards=
 and=0Aprocedures. In the meantime, vehicles that have not been certified=
 are being=0Areferred to a Referee facility for inspection and certificat=
ion. The Referee=0Awill perform a visual and functional inspection of the=
 vehicle and will use=0Athe newly revised standards for the tailpipe part=
 of the inspection. For some=0Aowners, this inspection will be free of ch=
arge, depending on the circumstances=0Asurrounding their original inspect=
ion. This will complete the Smog Check=0Ainspection process necessary for=
 the vehicle registration renewal. Vehicles=0Awhich have been certified s=
hould not experience this problem during their next=0Ainspection. End.=0A=
---------------=0AHere=92s an update: =0ASince Jan. 1 of this year, SB42 =
exempts all vehicles made prior to 1974 from=0Aannual smog checks. In fac=
t, if you go down to your local smog station they=0Awill no longer have a=
ny data on your vehicle in their smog computers.=0A=0AApparently your smo=
g technician was doing a pre-smog check because he would=0Ahave noticed y=
our car doesn=92t exist on his computer. BAR has issued notices to=0Aall =
smog inspection centers of the law change. Double check with him or go to=
=0Aanother station that=92s more knowledgeable. If you don=92t get any sa=
tisfaction=0Alocally, call DMV at (916) 657-7669. Hope this helps.=0A=0AB=
TW, to reduce HC, you should set the mixture leaner, not richer.=0A=0AShe=
rwood Lee=0A69 911=0A=0A<<I need some advice and information on engine tu=
ning. I have a 66 912.=0AThe engine was rebuilt 10,000 miles ago (shortly=
 after which it passed=0Athe CA smog check with flying colors). It also r=
uns with the original=0ASolex 40 PII carbs and the P & Cs are NPR 1720 Bi=
g Bore.  Two months ago=0AI received a notice from the DMV saying that my=
 car should have to pass=0Aanother smog check before I could receive the =
registration sticker. =0AI felt that my car was running very well and I a=
lso felt confident that=0Ait would pass the smog test with NO problem. I =
WAS SOOO WRONG. Going for=0Athe smog check that day was probably the dumb=
est thing I have done in=0Athe past year. You all have probably guessed b=
y now that the car failed=0Athe test. =0AThere are two parts to this CA s=
mog check.  The first part of the test=0Achecks emissions at idle RPM and=
 the 2nd phase checks the emissions at=0A2500 RPM.  During this test my c=
ar failed the idle portion of the test=0Abut passed the 2500 RPM part.  I=
 do not have the emission results from=0Athis test.  Needless to say, I w=
as quite dissappointed but I thought=0Apositively and decided that this h=
ad all happened for a reason.  This=0Awas also a good time to give my mot=
or a tune up.=0AI replaced the plugs, air cleaners, points, condenser, di=
stributor cap,=0Aand fuel filter. I set the timing to 3 degrees BTDC at 9=
00 rpm which is=0Athe set idle speed.  The carb linkage was adjusted and =
I was now ready=0Afor a smog retest. =0AI brought the car in for a retest=
 this morning after driving it for=0Aabout a half hour to make sure it wa=
s completely warmed up. This time,=0Athe car passed the idle portion of t=
he test but failed the 2500 RPM part=0Aof the test.  At 2500 RPM the meas=
ured HC ppm was 622 with the max.=0Aallowable being 600.  The smog tech m=
entioned something about making the=0Amixture richer to correct this.  I =
don't really remember since I was=0Avery annoyed with the test results.=
=0ACan anyone help with my situation.  If I need to make the mixture=0Ari=
cher, does that mean changing the main jets size?  What is the=0Arelation=
ship of the mixture to the HCs and CO%. I appreciate all=0Ainput .TIA=0A=
