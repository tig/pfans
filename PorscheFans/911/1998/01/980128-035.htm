Hello All,

Attempted for the first time to bleed the brakes on our 73T today. It looks as if 
it's been ten years since anyone has done this... first bleeder valve I tried is 
frozen tight. An hour or two of penetrating oil didn't help. Any suggestions 
from those of you who have been here and done this?

Are you sure you really need a digital camera?  If all you really want are
digital pictures and already have a 35mm SLR, there might be a cheaper
way.  There are fim companies that sell film that they will process and 
digitize them and give a floppy back with pictures on them, along with 
regular processed photographs.  Try Seattle Fimworks

Hey all,
I wrote an E-mail a couple of weeks ago responding to a post from a guy
that worked for Sharp or Sony and was selling digital still cameras for
a very good price.  Is he around on the list still?  Anyone know of how
to get back in touch with him?  I really need to get a dig cam soon but
am not too thrilled about the high prices that camera stores here in
town are asking.  Please get intouch with me if anyone has any leads.
