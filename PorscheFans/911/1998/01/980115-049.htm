Can you use your existing cell phone if you already have one?
Possibly, if its compatible with direct digital modulation, but the form
factor wouldn't be as easy to integrate with the GPS receiver and
control computer. A special cell phone (like a PCMCIA module) style is
what I plan on using along with a similar form factor GPS receiver.

I think this would be a feature worth the money, as long as it was not
simple to defeat like alarms appear to be.
The would be car thief wouldn't even know he/she/it was being tracked,
and therefor would have no reason to even look for the system much less
try and defeat it.

As far as the snoop option goes, valets would be officially on notice
(finally).
