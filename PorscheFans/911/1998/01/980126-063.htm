My '97 Carrera 4S is Glacier White, the brightest white that I have ever 
seen.  It doesn't seem to be a real popular color in Carreras, especially 
wide bodies.  I have never seen another wide body in Glacier White.  I'm
sure there are some out there.

If you'd really like to stay near the track that's ok but be prepared, the
cost is a bit extreme.  I don't want to steer you wrong but we've been for
several years and always stayed at the beach front hotels.  It's basically the
off season so rates are fair and it's only a five or six miles.  Most are
clean and cost half as much as the ones near the speedway.

The Posche Paddock is always easy to find and there's PCAers hangin out,
coming and going.  Last year it was near the lake side of the infield.  It's
like going to a home game for your favorite team since so many of us wear
Porsche stuff.

Later,

Zane
