I saw your posting on the pfans list, and you've got
my curiosity going...  I've got this *weird* feeling in 
the steering of my '89 TurboLook Targa, and I wonder
if this is causing it...

My steering is significantly heavier than my buddies 
77 carrera, and I can't figure out why...

I've also noticed a slightly sticky feeling from the wheel,
esp when driving on the freeway - it seems as if the 
wheel had a lock nut on it, and it got tightned...

Two other things I've noticed is that the turning effort
is much less after I turn the wheels side to side, like
when I just did the brakes - the steering effort was 
slightly less after this... 

And, I've noticed the effort is less when I'm over sand,
or light dirt on the road, which led me to believe it was
the tires (which are new dunlop dm40's) or perhaps
the steering rack...?

I'll look into the shocks - I was going to replace them soon,
although not sure what with... the koni's are too rich for
my blood, and I can't believe they make all that much
difference...

Does anyone have any experience w/ shocks that spin
easier, or have less tendency to stick?

BTW, how did you get at the shock rod to spray it - isn't
it covered with the sleeve of the shock?
