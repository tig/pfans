In early December, my 1989 911 went into hibernation in the garage.  All
the basics were done, with gasoline stabilizer, covering intake and
exhaust, pumping up tires, etc, etc.  I won't run the car until it's
ready to go on the road again.

Just yesterday, I pulled the battery and want advice on the best way to
minimize springtime problems.

Should I:
1.  Purchase a trickle charger or
2.  Let the battery sit and in the spring have the local garage put a
full charge on it?  If this is ok, meaning that the battery will take a
charge in the spring and the winter's rest  won't reduce the battery's
life span, then I'd prefer not to purchase the trickle charger.  Also,
it's a Porsche battery that was in the vehicle when I purchased the 911
a year ago.  Is there a code or marking that will tell me it's age?

Ideas and experiences appreciated.

Regards,   Bill Lion
