[i'm posting this for a very nice gentleman i met while car shopping.  i 
elected not to buy his car, but offered to post a note here, since he's 
eager to sell.  i have no further relationship to him or the car.]

1972 911T dark blue with black & tan interior, fuchs wheels.
~105K miles, ~10K on rebuilt motor.  new master cylinder.
an arizona car with no rust, and only minor paint defects on front and 
rear hoods (repainted original color ~2 years ago).  interior is in good 
shape, except for the seats.  the car has a/c, but no sunroof.

asking $8500 OBO

the owner sent me photo's of the car, and it looks stunning; i wanted to 
rush out and buy it immediately.  the owner is a really nice guy; he 
lives on a ranch about 2 hours NW of phoenix, arizona.

give him a call at 520.442.3415 if you are interested.
