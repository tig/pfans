Hi PFans,

Thanks for all the answers I got, again this list is great,
and also the people who participate and share there
experience & knowledge.  My original post on 05 Jan. and
answers on 06 Jan. so if you missed it and are interested
please check the archives so I do not wast so much BW.

A. Chain wheel wear.
     I will check the intermediate shaft wheels with a dentist mirror
     as Walt Fricke advised, but will verify the alignement carefully
     when I assemble the engine.

B. Chains.
     Chains will be replaced and Ross Parker told the correct
     way to install the master link clip. Closed part to face direction
     of travel and sharp side out.

C. Chain ramps.
     It was a general opinion that they are quite brittle, but these will=
 =

     be changed.

D. Cylinder bottom copper gasket.
     Here my wording was bad, what I mean with pulling out is that on
     two cylinders the gasket was pushed out. Like a head gasket
     would blow out. I see no marks on either cylinders or case that
     there would be anything wrong with the surfaces, perhaps an
     installation error? =


E. Cylinder head nuts.
     The nuts was so dry that three actually expanded so much
     that I had to wedge feeler gauges between the allen socket and nut
     to get them open. Washer surfaces and stud threads look OK, so
     I will get new nuts only. Perhaps assembled dry?

F. Piston pin locks.
    Here major opinion was to re-use the old ones. In some engines they
    have to be replaced after use.

G. Piston rings.
    As mine are still well within spec. I think I will re-use them. =

    Like Dave Cooley pointed out, they are seated in pistons and cyl.
    and the leakdown was good. Looking at valve seats, I believe the
    figures will be even better after cyl. heads are done.
    Chris Woodward reminded that the ring land clearance is more
    critical than end gap. Absolutely right! If new rings are installed
    in a worn ring groove, usually the rings break as the ring groove
    do not "support" the ring when piston change direction. =


H. Measurement from valve spring bearing surface to valve stem.
    OK Walt, I rewarded myself with few push-ups after writing this
    backwards, of course as You pointed out the 46,0 +0,3 is the
    max dimension, so there is still something to grind. =

    When the heads are done, I will check the spring height & pressure.

I. Valve stem wear.
   Bought a micrometer and will check & replace as necessary.

J. Splitting the case.
   Majority advised to go ahead and split the case, at least to check
   some rod bearings. New magnafluxed bolts & nuts like everybody told. =


Now I have wasted enough BW and try to avoid more long storys, but
here in a country with so few Porsches, it is nice to get some advice.

Thanks,
