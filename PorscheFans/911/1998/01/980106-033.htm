I used to purchase JC Whitney H4 bulbs with 100 or 130 watts high
beams, etc.  Put out nice light, but I seemed to have burned out bulbs all
the time.  I can't remember what I have in there now, but they have lasted
a long time (maybe something like 55/80, or maybe I just put the stock
wattage bulbs which came with my H4 kit back in).  I wondered if this
short life was because the extra power meant extra heat and the normal
vibration of driving gave a drastically shortened service life (a few
months, as I recall).  I had (and still have) relays operating not only the
high beams but also the low beams, so voltages were always OK. 
Nothing about the bulbs jumped out at you when looking them over and
cried "Cheap, cheap, junk, junk."  Lately I noticed JCW has several
different prices for H4s of this high wattage type.  Anyone done a
comparison, found more expensive one's last a lot longer because of
stronger filaments or whatnot?
