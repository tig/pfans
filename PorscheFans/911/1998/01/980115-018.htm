**** Story: ****
Last week, I smelled gasoline fumes coming through my heat/defrost
vents.  Initially, I thought that perhaps I had a pin hole in the
exhaust wall of one heat exchanger, that the engine was cold and
running rich, and that it would clear up once the engine heated up.
Ten miles later, the fumes were stronger than ever.  I pulled over,
and popped the engine lid.  What I saw scared the sh*t out of me.
There was a pin hole in the rubber section of the pressurized fuel
line just to the left of the T-junction where the fuel line goes
over to feed 1-2-3 bank cylinders.  The leak was on top of the hose
and there was a steady stream of gas spraying on the intake manifold.

Several thoughts crossed my mind:
"Holy Sh*t!, shut the car off."
"Well, I know where the fumes are coming from."
"Fuel IN engine = Good.  Fuel ON engine = Bad."
"This was a disaster in progress.  I can't believe I made it this far."

In true handyman fashion, I found a roll of Duct Tape and reinforced
threaded packing tape.  I patched and bound the line the best I
could, stopped the leak, and made it home.

**** Analysis: ****
Looking at the failure, I saw that the rubber section was dried and
cracking.  So, the local spot repair approach (of which there are a
couple options) does not seem advisable.  At the very least, I
need to replace the complete rubber section.  Unfortunately, the
rubber line is crimped at ends to brass elbow and T-junctions.
"Hmmm, this is part of a larger fuel line assembly.  OK, normally
a fuel line might be about $50.  But, this is a Porsche, so perhaps
this one will be around $150."

I stopped by the local Porsche dealer the next day.  "Ah yes," he
said, "Porsche part #930.110.595.05.  That's $478.35.  We have one
in stock."   OUCH!!   The complete assembly actually extends all
the way to the fuel pump, up by the steering rack.  There are no
connector breaks anywhere along the line.

Appearantly, this is becoming a very common
failure in the SCs and Carreras.  Years of baking away in the heat
right over the engine, and the recent introduction of the oxygenated
fuel (more corrosive), is prematurely aging these rubber lines.  The
new Porsche part has replaced the old material with a new flexible
compound more resistant to this deterioration.  

"Hmmm, there must be a better way."  I called a few hydraulic shops
hoping they could replace the rubber section with new fuel line and
crimp it in like original high quality fashion.  Nope.  Understandably,
they can't take that kind of risk.  They suggested I could wrap it
with a second mesh line as an external repair.  But, I don't like
that approach either.

Shopping around via mail order I found that Porsche is the only
supplier of this part.  However, I did find that both Vertex and
PAR would sell it for $400.  "Well, at least I can shave $80 off."
So, I have a new fuel line assembly on its way.

**** HELP ****
Here's where I seek the collective wisdom of the Pfans.

Does anyone have any experience in this area?  In order to replace the
fuel line assembly, do I have to drop the engine?  Or, if I wiggle
and twist and contort my hands and arms, can I do it in place?  Any
suggestions and information will be appreciated.

Keep Porsching,
Wayne
