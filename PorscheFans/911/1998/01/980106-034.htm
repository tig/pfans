There is an article in Panorama which (or maybe it is Bruce Anderson's
book) which covers the hardness of the various valve seats used in
Porsche's. Without recalling the specifics, that article claimed that
there was no problem with using unleaded fuel in earlier 911's as the
seat material is hard enough to do without the cushioning effect of the
lead used in gasoline.

I researched it rather extensively a few years ago as I have a European
engine (1978 930/03) and there is only unleaded fuel available in Canada
(which is where I live). Conclusion after both reading and talking to
Kremer brothers as well as discussion with the good folk at Shell Canada
(where I was working at the time) was that there was no problem with the
lack of lead.

Now the lower octane generally available in many unleaded fuels......now
that is a problem.'
