It very much depends on the engine. Without wanting to seem
obnoxious especially to someone with poor oil consumption
(or an old Lotus Elite with a Coventry Climax engine <g>),
if your engine is really tight, ten times that is possible 
(mine was getting 1 qt/5,000 miles until an oil line opened up).

The only thing I think that I can attribute the low consumption
to is that when I purchased it (151,000 miles), I immediately
put Carrera tensioners in and the mechanic did a REALLY good
job of putting the engine back together.
