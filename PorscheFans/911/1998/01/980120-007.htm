     Am having the leather seats on my 73 T recovered and thought it might
be a good idea to repaint/restore the black hinge plates that connect the
seat bottom to the seat back on both sides of the seat.

     Does any body know how to accurately duplicate the textured black
coating on the stamped metal.  Is it a special paint?  Is there a textured
undercoat applied first.  Does it have to be done professionally or can I
do it myself so that it looks factory original?  In the event that I can do
this myself, do things come apart easily or are there a lot of rivets and
stamped connections?

     An unrelated social note:  Seeing Jon Lowe's comments on sportomatics
in yesterday's digest reminded me of times in the long past spent together
at OVR events and at Mid-Ohio.  Good to see you're still around Jon.  Still
have the yellow 911?
