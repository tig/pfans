Paul has this problem with his '79:

--My speedo light doesn't work when the lights are fully on, i.e. when the
lights switch is all the way out and the headlights are on.
However, when the light switch is only halfway out (i.e. parking lights
on only), the speedo light works fine.
Also, when I turn the light switch the lights on the dash do not "dim"
or "brighten".--

Well, assuming they used to work for you (no former owner messing
with the wiring somehow), I'd suspect the light switch.  Since it isn't
cheap, I'd take it out and disassemble it (be very careful to note how the
large ceramic part which slides inside fits into the case - it will go in
several ways, only one of which is right and isn't easy to figure out). 
See if contacts are burned or messed up, and why the dimmer rheostat
stays full on.  This is really an ingenious, well built mechanism.  You
might be able to repair it.

I got into mine because my headlights quit while driving due to contact
wear associated with high currents (which is why I added relays).  The
instrument lights shouldn't have current problems, but that's all I can think
of to suggest.  And I can't think offhand why your funny problem affects
only the speedo light, as I think all the instrument lights are on the same
circuit (which woud be why your dimmer problem affects them all).

Maybe before pulling the switch you should pull your speedo out and
check all the connections, including especially the ground (brown) wires.

Of course,  you will want to make a diagram of which wires go where
on the switch (the spade lugs on the switch are all numbered nearby,
which is a help in matching the wire colors to a lug), and disconnect the
battery before you remove it, if you get to that point.

Now that the California legislature is finally thinking the way I do, and my
72 911 is finally smog exempt (Many whoops and hollers!!!!!) I was considering
the idea of removing the factory exaust system on the 3.2 Euro that powers the
car and replacing it with the original 72 heat exchangers.  I also have the
original 72 muffler, but I was thinking about an upgrade in that area to a
sport muffler or ????.  I would still like to be able to hold a conversation
in the car.

I have read many postings debating after market modifications but cannot
recall much on this topic. I have always thought the early heat exchangers are
comparable to equal length headers that many aftermarket companies promote. Is
this true, or should I turn my old exaust into a creative roadside rural
mailbox sculpture? 

My questions are:
1) What level of performance gain should be expected?
2) Do I need to accomodate the oxygen sensor in the 72 heat exchangers?
3) Would this modification alone upset the balance of the motor?
4) Overall, is it a worthwhile effort on this motor?
5) Would my neighbors like the sculpture?

Any advice and or specifics on this would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Jon Martin
