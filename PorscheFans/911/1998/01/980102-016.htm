Carter:

Got your e-mail address through the 356 Registry e-mail pages, and
appreciated your comments. Please visit the 912 Registry at

http://pages.prodigy.net/beckers/912reg/index.html

Hope you like it, and contact other 912 owners worldwide!  It's not
meant to "compete" with any other Porsche pages, in fact it hyperlinks
to the 356 Registry, PCA, POC, Early 911S Registry, and a lot of other
great sites.  We have received positive feedback that a 912-specific
site is appreciated.

I believe 912 owners take pride in the 356 heritage in their cars, but
since most were built after 1965, take pride in the 911 heritage in
their cars as well.  It's a great blend, and I personally do get tired
of the "poor man's Porsche" tag occasionally attached to the 912.

30,000+ of these cars were produced, let's keep as many preserved and
out of the bones yard as possible!  Hope to see everyone at Laguna Seca
for the Historic Races.

Cheers,
Rick Becker
