Jon,

While much of what Ross said is certainly true, the more general truth is
that lines don't differ too very much among most of the cars you'll see
at a club race.  Get some motorcycles, NASCAR cars or F1 cars on 
the track and the story begins to change.

The line can be thought of as both the path the car takes and what 
the driver is doing with throttle, brakes and steering along that line.
The biggest differences will be in the use of throttle, brakes and steering.
For those cases where you're not hiding the right path from a competitor,
practicing alternate lines, avoiding surface problems or trying to 
keep someone from passing you, the PATH is pretty much dependent on 
a few factors:
	the extent to which the car will increase speed from the beginning 
		of the corner to the exit point,
	the extent to which the driver is willing to accept increased risk
		by using an earlier apex
	whether the car has the ability to generate power-based
		oversteer on this surface at this speed in this corner.

Cars that won't accelerate much in a corner (most 914 fours) should
normally be on a line that is pretty much a constant radius curve,
which ends up being more-or-less a neutral apex point.  The greater
the ability of the car to accelerate in the corner, the later the apex will
need to be, but, again, the differences in apex point are usually a very
few feet at most.  The turnin point may be different by 10-15 feed in the
most extreme comparisons.

The safe line at the beginning (of a day, a career or learning a new track)
involves somewhat later turnins and later apexes.  The search for
optimal lap times pushes the turnin and apex points back to a more
neutral position.

With a car that understeers mightily, the driver might be on the brakes
(somewhat lightly) to the apex and beyond, while a 911 set to "twitchy"
might have to put the loud pedal all the way down before even initiating
the turn.  But the paths they are on will still be pretty similar.

A key exception to this is for certain turns where the optimal path isn't
at all clear.  
There are some turns that involve intricate tradeoffs between finishing
one turn and beginning the next.  At issue may be where to be where
you turn in to the second turn, with tradeoffs involving extra ground
covered (to get wide enough for the second turn entry, for example) versus
the higher speed through the corner if you do get wide enough.  The
real truth of the matter will somewhat depend on the length of the 
straight after the second of these turns.  Turn 9 at Laguna Seca
is like this, and there were also some issues at ThunderHill (original
configuration) between three and four and 8 and 8A.  At Seca you can
see the professional drivers taking a number of lines into 9.  The bikes
(which are very much point-and-shoot vehicles, sort of the ultimate 930)
usually don't even bother to set a proper entry for 9, heading from the
exit of 8A to more-or-less the apex of 9, effectively creating the earliest
apex conceivable.

Forgetting about formula, NASCAR and bikes, even within competent
club racing you'll see a lot of variety in such corners.  Ask 5 good club
racers/time-trialers about their line in 9 at Seca and you'll get five
different answers (six, if one of them went to Stanford!) 

Hope this helps.
