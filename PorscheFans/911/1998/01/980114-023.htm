Just to add two cents to the rambling H4 headlight thread, I put the H4
(two-filament) variety on my SC several years ago and even with 55/60
watt lamps have been quite impressed with their improved optical
performance... and I drive fast at night in deer country.  I'd
originally planned to go to 55/100 W lamps but due to the fragility of
the dip switch, decided I was quite happy with 55/60.  (I did change the
foglights to driving lights and wire them to come on with the high
beams... but they're just a placebo... the larger and better designed
main light reflectors do 90% of the work.)  My headlights came with
chrome rims which I prepped and painted with spraycan paint, back before
the EPA made Imparts stop selling spray paint --- I didn't expect this
amateur paint job to last, but it has held up quite well.

One little worry always in the back of my mind with this car is that it
feels like a Personal Injury magnet... I imagine that one little tap on
the bumper of the beater car in front of me will set off a round of
"he's rich, let's soak him" feeding frenzy (California's state sport, at
least judging by the thickness of that section of the Yellow Pages). 
Since the H4s are technically illegal, I can further imagine, and have
even heard rumors of, irresponsible attorneys siezing upon the "glare"
from this "reckless" modification to explain away poor driving by their
clients.  Not something I lie awake at night worrying about, almost more
of a curiousity... is anyone aware of any kind of prosecution and/or
liability claim arising from the operation of properly aimed, but still
not DOT-approved, headlights?

curious as always,
