Paul,

That's what I love about the list.  If we can't have fun ribbing each oth=
er
without hostility breaking out then I'd leave in a second.  No, make that=
 a
half of a second--gonna drop the hammer you know!!  :o)

This list seems to get along very well, unlike some other lists that I'm =
on.
Must be the cars.

You took a fair amount of ribbing in the Archives --- don't let it bother
you.  The guys are always looking for a way to inject some humor into the
tedium of "what sort of sealant do I use when installing my windows" sort
of postings.

The problems with drag racing and Porsches goes back a long ways.  The
early 356 axles would just snap the first time someone dropped the clutch
in one of those cars.  All stock Porsches are too heavy to withstand drag
race starts, but once you lighten them up, the parts tend to withstand th=
e
shock loads.  The 4-speed 915 (early 911) transmissions were utilized by =
a
number of guys running highly modified VW-based dragsters in years past,
although the more favored Porsche transaxle now is the 930 4-speed.

In the late 80's, my partner and I built a fiberglass Porsche speedster
that was lengthened out a bit, and fitted with a 400+ horsepower
turbocharged 2000 cc engine.  At 9.36 in the quarter mile, we had the
record for full-bodied "on gas" 4-cylinder quarter-miler for a few years.
This was after only 6 months of racing the car, and I had never dragraced
any sort of car before this one, so I was anything but an experienced
racecar driver.  If you're curious and want to read some material on this
car, send to me your "snail mail" address, and I'll mail some photos and =
an
article about the car.

And if you should ever need special gears for whatever application, give =
me
a jingle at (888) 89 GEARS.
