I had a total loss back in 1996 - Leland West simply referred me to the
insurance carrier, who wasn't very good about responding. Their adjuster was
dealing with floods back east. Once I finally made contact, a week later, they
were fine to deal with, and went to bat for me in getting top dollar out of
State Farm for the car. 

(State Farm was the carrier for the dummy who hit the car while it was parked
on the side of the freeway with a flat tire). 

I'm still insured with them, this time for stated value.

FWIW 993 owners.  In the process of having installed Porsche factory euro 993
lowering springs on my 96 C2.  Fronts, no problem (1.1" lower).  Rears:
problem.  Seems that U.S. 993s have shocks made by Monroe in Belgium!  Rear
factory Euro springs leave approx 2" gap between lowest coil set and shock
spring perch.  When car set down, need to "manually guide"shock to correctly
sit on perches (upper and lower)!  A pain, at a minimum and IMHO not the way
Porsche engineers envision.  Solution?  Live with this (per Michael at
ByDesign) since no reported problems with > 300 sets sold.  Talked via
conference call with Howard at PCNA who confirms "problem" with a solution of
installing Euro shocks (unavailable us) or "tie wrapping upper and lower coil
to perches to prevent floppiness and assist guide downing when  dropping onto
suspension."  This is unacceptable "fix" IMHO.  Eibach "proline" series has
progressive rate springs and rear spring is 1/2" shorter than factory U.S.
spring, to avoid "gap" problem, yet still lowers 1".   Now have expended 7+
labor hours twice all with the original desire to maintain  "factory" and
"genuine Porsche" standards.  Hope this helps others to avoid "shooting
themselves in the foot."   Any comments/thoughts?  I've ordered the Eibachs.
