Greetings all,

I am seeking genral input on two related topics - a major engine makeover
for a '97 933 and using Powerhaus to do that job.

First, I would like ot solicit input on the wisdom and practicality of
increasing the stock displacement from 3.6L to 3.8L.  Powerhaus suggests
swapping to 102mm pistons and doing a bid of head machining along with
connecting rod changes to make things fit.  Given that this car was
"non-turbo" from the factory, I do not want to make engine modifications
that go beyond what is "reasonably prudent" from an engineering
perspective.  Increasing displacement must mean, somewhere, we are removing
metal from the engine (cylinder walls and heads) that Porsche put there.
Certainly that would increase static, dynamic and themal loads..... but
would those increases still be within general design limitations of the
block???  If this is not the right way to think about this issue, then
please, I welcome your thoughts.

Next comes the damned fuel computer.  I understand the stock Bosch unit now
in the car cannot yet be remapped and a major engine displacement would
require installing a "Motronic" engine controller.  Any thoughts or
experiences here??  I understand that moving away from the Bosch box will
mean more frequent required tuning - the guys at the Stable here in San
Francisco tell me that the Bosch controller has a range of "maps" it
switches between based on engine behavior - sort of like it is "self
tuning".  A "sport cam" offerring higher, longer duration lift is also
suggested... but I wonder if that means the car will not pass California
emissions standards (an absolute must as it is my street car).

Last... I have poked around the net looking for comments and experiences
regarding doing business with Powerhaus and wanted to solicit opinions from
 the group.  After having read the threads on Windward, I am all the more
interested in making certain i understand all the pros and cons of a major
engine job - both "hardware" and "service provider".  

Many thanks......feel free to respond to me directly if you prefer....
