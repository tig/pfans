    Larry:

    I have no reason to doubt them, but that information doesn't mean
    much... Most people lower their cars purely for aesthetic
    reasons, and it's doubtful that they'd even know what to
    complain ABOUT.

    "Droop travel" is suspension travel in the direction that moves
    the wheels away from the chassis; it's the direction that the
    wheels move when they droop down and the springs and shocks
    extend.

    Trvel in the other direction (the direction that the wheels move
    when they travel over a bump and the springs compress) is called
    "bump travel".

    That's a good way to look at it -- I mean, converting to the
    full Euro-spec suspension won't make the car undrivable or
    anything -- but you might want to consider this: 

    If we assume that there's just one suspension configuration
    that's "perfect", must that perfect setup be the Euro one? It
    seems to me that the American setup might be just as likely to be
    the "perfect" one... Especially if we're allowed to include such
    considerations as noise and harshness in the definition.

    I'm CERTAINLY not saying that the American setup is definitely
    preferable -- I honestly don't know -- but it's probably not wise
    to ALWAYS expect that the Euro configuration is superior to the
    American.

    In any case...

    If all else is equal, more suspension travel is always preferable
    to less.  Of course, it's usually hard to arrange things so you
    have a lot of suspension travel AND don't have to compromise
    other areas.
