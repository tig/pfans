    Bob:

    It's a battery whose electrical and mechanical specs are
    superior to most... It's smaller, lighter, and immune to
    vibration damage.

    It won't leak acid, it can't explode, and you can mount it in
    any position, even upside down.

    By the way... It's not a gel cell, no matter what everyone says.

    Most performance-parts distributors sell them.

    A lot... About three or four times as much as what you've been
    used to paying.

    The Optimas are nice, but I personally wouldn't buy one for a
    street car; their advantages (to me) don't outweigh the high
    cost.
