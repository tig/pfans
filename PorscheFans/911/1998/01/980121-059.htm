Dear P-Fans,
Work continues on my '77 91 Coupe and I ready to install the rear deck
of the interior.  But first I need to wire up the rear window defogger
element.  Coming out of the bottom of the window seal,left lower corner,
are ofur wires about 5 inches long each.  Two red wires and two brown
wires.  Checked continuity of wire with ohmmeter and both element
circuits appear to be fine.  The problem is these wires are just hanging
there.  I've have traced the circuit from the fuse box, through the
switch, to the relay(two stage) and out the connector by the ignition
module.  It ends there at the connector.  I have no wire harness to plug
in to that would lead up to rear window element.  My question(s) are:
1. How is the harness routed through or around the firewall to the rear
window wires if it were there? 
2. Does any one have this harness laying around the garage from a race
car project and want to sell it? (the connector is a small rectangle
about 3/4"x1/4", three holes in it, with only two wires)
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  TIA
