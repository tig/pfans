Well, since it's a '72, it doesn't have to pass CA smog unless it doesn't
have the original engine in it (and even then, it still may not have to
pass).  Assuming it passes a pre-buyer mechanical inspection by a
reputable shop, it sounds like a pretty good price to me.

Things to watch: have the shop doing the inspection make sure the MFI
pump is in good working order, with the fuel mixture at a reasonable
point (not too lean or too rich, and with at least a little room for
adjustment either way).  Also, some of those oil hoses can be a bit
costly to replace, since the '72 has a unique location for the oil tank.
These are of course in addition to the normal early 911 things - updated
chain tensioners, straight body, absense of rust, etc., etc.

Good luck!
