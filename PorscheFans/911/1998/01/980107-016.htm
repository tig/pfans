My understanding is that BMW's problems stem from a poor coice of 
aluminum alloy used for the block and not the cylinder coating 
itself. Something to do with thermal expansion characteristics. I'm 
guessing that the different design parameters of the air-cooled 
cylinders prevented them from making a similar mistake.

Hi P-Fans ( and Garth Gullekson):

I've read your question on Redline MTL trans oil with interest. I've run MTL
in my Eagle Talon with great results. MTL was recommended to improve the
notchiness I had with gear changing ( which it has improved), yet it is not
too slippery to beat the synchros. However, in my opinion, it should not be
used in the 911. I think you've answered your own question,  when you
correctly state that API service grade GL-5 is required for the Porsche. The
Talon is OK with API grade GL-4.  GL-5 can be used where GL-4 is called out,
but not the other way around. I run a mineral oil (Swepco) in the 911, it is
rated GL-5,  and it seems better than the factory stuff by virtue of improved
shifting.   If you insist on synthetic, Mobil 1 synthetic trans lube is ( I
believe ) rated GL-5 and some say it even reduces trans operating
temperatures. I will likely try this myself for the next lube change. Hope
this helps.
