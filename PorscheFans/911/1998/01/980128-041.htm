Hi everyone (sorry I forgot the add on at the end),

    I just ordered (actually my mech. did) a set of H&R lowering springs

for my 97 993 from Performance Products (they were on sale for $300 in
the Dec issue of Excellence). The ad says they are 200-255(F),
275-300(R) HR30-993. Does anyone know if I will have the problem
described below with the european factory spring? Also, I'm going to be
installing a 3.8 GT rear wing on the 993 and will need to remove the
movable wing. Does anyone know anything about the movable wing position
microswitch sensors and which connector/contacts needs to be "jumpered"
to fool the onboard computer into thinking the microswitches are working

correctly.

    Thanks for the help,

    Mike Wyatt

Subject: 993 Lowering springs

FWIW 993 owners.  In the process of having installed Porsche factory
euro 993
lowering springs on my 96 C2.  Fronts, no problem (1.1" lower).  Rears:
problem.  Seems that U.S. 993s have shocks made by Monroe in Belgium!
Rear
factory Euro springs leave approx 2" gap between lowest coil set and
shock
spring perch.  When car set down, need to "manually guide"shock to
correctly
sit on perches (upper and lower)!  A pain, at a minimum and IMHO not the
way
Porsche engineers envision.  Solution?  Live with this (per Michael at
ByDesign) since no reported problems with > 300 sets sold.  Talked via
conference call with Howard at PCNA who confirms "problem" with a
solution of
installing Euro shocks (unavailable us) or "tie wrapping upper and lower
coil
to perches to prevent floppiness and assist guide downing when  dropping
onto
suspension."  This is unacceptable "fix" IMHO.  Eibach "proline" series
has
progressive rate springs and rear spring is 1/2" shorter than factory
U.S.
spring, to avoid "gap" problem, yet still lowers 1".   Now have expended
7+
labor hours twice all with the original desire to maintain  "factory"
and
"genuine Porsche" standards.  Hope this helps others to avoid "shooting
themselves in the foot."   Any comments/thoughts?  I've ordered the
Eibachs.
