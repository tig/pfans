Would anyone of a metallurgical mind care to expound for a paragraph or
two on Nikasil and Alusil... what they're made of, how they're
fabricated, what their performance characteristics are, and
(especially), implications during engine overhaul (ie how/if they can
be  re-ringed, honed, bored, or otherwise refurbished)?  I've read
snippets in Frere's book and "Upfixin" (high silicon content, hard
wearing surface, good oil retention, etc), but haven't seen anything
comprehensive recently that takes into account the two decades and
zillions of miles of experience we now have with these cylinder lining
technologies.  

As some of you may know BMW had a major debacle with their recent line
of V8 engines employing (initially) similar technology (can you say
"sir, the dealer will replace your engine block now"?), and I'm
wondering among other things how Porsche escaped this kind of problem.
