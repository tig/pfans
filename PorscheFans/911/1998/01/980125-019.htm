** Hello and thanks for all of the assistance with the high idle problem
with my '79 930.  It turned out the problem was actually two-fold and I
wanted to share the solution as there have been several people that had
similar problems with their 930.

A quick recap:  My car would normally idle at 1200-1500rpm even when the
engine was warmed up and driven for an extended period.  After the engine
got warm and was shut off, the idle jumped to 2500-3000 rpm upon restart.
With my dual 4" rolled custom exhaust pipes the noise was very noticeable.

The solution:  We found that the old throttle body had a small hole in it
which screwed with the air/fuel mix.  So we replaced that and then we found
that the auxiliary air valve needed to be replaced (thanks Dave Cooley for
that tip) which cured the high idle when the engine was warm problem.  Now
the car is at a nice 800 rpm idle.

This list is great and I hope to contribute more as my experience expands.

** I have another annoying problem, which I hope someone out there can
assist me with.  The fuse that protects the left side parking lights and
the hood light keeps popping when I turn the lights on in my car.  The only
wires that are connected to the fuse is a moderately thick red one.  Is
there a quick way to find out what is causing the short?  The P.O. had
installed a hack job of a fuel cutoff switch with lots of electrical tape
and duct tape all over the footwell.  I was thinking that this could be the
problem, but even after disconnecting and disassembling the unit the fuse
still pops when the lights are turned on.  After first glance, the wiring
for both front and rear lights look good.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance for any assistance.


** There was a thread about painting our beloved cars.  I just had my car
taken down to the metal, primered, wetsanded and painted (original Petrol
Blue color).  The took out the windows and tore the body down and resealed
everything (since the paint and seals were 19 years old).  I added the H4
headlights with the updated thin painted trim.  The entire job took 12
weeks to finish, but well worth it as it looks incredible with an almost
mirror-like finish! The cost was around $5,000.
