Hi all,
Please pardon the second post here, but apparently the first post was
jumbled for some readers, perhaps because I included my email address, which
looks like a "link", and not standard text-only.
I'll keep this one very brief:  I build an enclosure for the 1974-1989 911 &
930, and I've been doing this part-time for the past few years, with about
250 sold to date.  This is a very economical and satisfying solution to the
lack of space for any attractive subwoofer options in these cars.  I build
each one personally by hand, and I personalize it with your name, my
signature, and the date.  Please email me for details and I'll also email a
picture of the installed enclosure.  The ad is also in Excellence Magazine.
Thanks, and again, please pardon my post if you're reading it a second
time...  <:o)
