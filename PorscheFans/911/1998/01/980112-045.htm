hello there in the Lowlands.  Ever find anyone to play with on the track?

On my 77 the small tank on top in the left front fenderwell has nothing to
do with water and washers - it is the gasoline overflow or expansion
tank.  It is also the source of gasoline fumes which I smell when I fill my
tank to the very top, because one of the fabric covered hoses has
gotten rotten and leaks a little and I haven't replaced it.

When I have overfilled the washer tank it overflows at the filler by the
gas cap where I pour it in.  There isn't any other place in an intact system
for water to come out - no overflow system for the washer tank.  At
least I don't remember one, and I have had my tank out and apart some
years ago so I could add an outlet to the tank for headlight squirters (not
standard back then).  So this symptom is a mystery, although it suggests
something is broken and leaking.  Of course, Porsche may have changed
the plumbing by 87.  On the other hand, the gas and washer filler cavity
below the flap door has its own drain to catch whatever (especially
gasoline) overflows into it on filling.  Doesn't this run down a tube in front
of the door?

As I recall, on the other side of that screw-on cap on the tank is a tube
which reaches down to the bottom of the tank and has a filter on its end.
 I suppose this works to get cleaning fluid to the pump partly as a syphon
and partly because of suction the pump creates.   I'd take the hose off of
this cap and 1) blow into the hose to see if you can blow all the way to
your new pump connection, and if so, 2) attach another hose to the cap
(so you don't have to stick your head up in there) and blow into the tank. 
If you can't hear the air bubbling out inside the tank you know there is
something wrong here and can unscrew the cap and pull the gizmo out
and look at it.  I don't know that these things clog up or get pinched (hard
for either to happen, really), but you could see soon enough, and also
figure out just how much fluid there actually is in the tank.

My prediction:  you are going to find a pinched line between tank and
pump.  These pumps don't last long if run dry, so this may have been
why your previous pump burned out.  That only leaves the leak on filling
to deal with, which you should be able to track down easily enough by
looking in there as you fill with the tire off to see where the fluid is spilling
from.

I'd be cautious about sucking (unless you use a pump).  My favorite
Brueghel shows frozen water in those canals and the globe hasn't
warmed that much since then, so you must use something to prevent
freezing in your water along with some sort of solvent, and none of
these are designed for human consumption, although they are not deadly
poisons in the small doses we incautious ones spit out in dismay either
or I wouldn't be tapping out e-mails.

Subject: Porsche Market Letter

A while back, Porsche Market Letter was offering to print free ads for
people who originally sent their ads into local PCA newsletters. Does
that offer still stand, and what do I need to do to take part in it.
(Yes, I know PCA has said we should not do this, but if members want
their ads published there as well, I'm not going to deny them).

PML can be contacted at PMLetter@aol.com

I'm curious, why would anyone suggest not sending an ad to PML? I know the
owners of this magazine. They are a husband an wife couple who are active PCA
members and supporters. Pat Vanbuskirk (wife half of the couple) is co-editor
with me this year of the San Diego Region newsletter, the Windblown Witness.

Subject: Experience w/ Motorworks (San Diego)


Hi all,

Has anyone had any experience with Motorworks in San Diego?  I'm
considering sending my engine block to them so that can check and
hone the cylinders.

Everytime I've talked to them on the phone, they've come across as
being rude, which gives me doubts about using them.

Thanks!!

(oh, yea...does anyone know of other machine shops that can reapply
the silicon to the cylinders?)

I can tell you that Motor Works has a more than excellent reputation here in
San Diego. I get into their shop regularly. As a matter of fact they just
magnafluxed my 356SC crankshalf, polished the crank, balanced the engine,
surfaced the flywheel.

I've known them for years. Most of the "good" Porsche independents around her
also use them for items that require "the right shop." Their prices are
sometimes a little more expensive but worth it.

If you want through their shop you're likely to see engines laying around from
a 300SL or some 30's car I've never heard of.

I could give you a list as long as my arm of PCA members here who've used them
for years. I believe they can nicasil 944 cylinders as well.

As far as their seeming rude on the phone. Well, it's probably the Italian
accents and being involved with Ferrari decades ago.... but that's just a
rumor.

Last year they had a 928 motor in there sent from a shop, well, I'd better not
say. I think Motor Works is a little known secret to some motor builders when
they need something never done before done right.
