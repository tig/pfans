The deck speakers simply come out the top once you have removed
the four mounting screws at each corner of the factory grills. You have
limited choices for replacements where modification of the deck itself
is not desired:

- a 4x6 replacement
- a 'plate' style speaker which 'fits' in the factory hole

The problem with the 4x6 is that it is difficult to find a good speaker with
the
proper grill clearance if you want to use the factory grills. Turns out that
very
few if any manufacturers provide grills with 4x6 replacement speakers
since they are usually true replacements for factory speakers.

A better choice in my opinion, is a plate style speaker. You get
a larger woofer, a separate, higher quality tweeter, a built in crossover,
and they can be installed easily using the factory speaker holes for woofer
magnet/frame clearance. Check with Crutchfield. They recently had a fairly
large number of the Blaupunkt plates in stock. However, they don't often
have these types of speakers at all, so if you're interested, you should call
soon. If you need the model number drop me an e-mail.
