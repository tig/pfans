Scott,

I'm struggling with the same issue for my car. I have worn out a set of 18"
Bridgestone S02 tires because of lots of driver ed event. These are
probably the best high performance (all around) tires available. They are
great in the rain, in the dry, on the street, and on the track. But it
depends on what your priorities are: street or track. Then you will have to
decide which venue you are willing to compromise. Street tires will not
give you ultimate track performance. Race tires will not give you ultimate
street performance. If your priority is street driving, then the S02 and a
number of other tires are excellent choices. Pirelli P-Zero, Yokohama
AVS-S1Z, Dunlop SP-8000, come to mind as excellent alternatives. This is
from my own experience and talking to others. You probably have 15" or 16"
wheels so you have a lot of other choices as well. The Firestone SZ is very
similar to the S02 but is much cheaper. If your priority is the track then
I think you need to get another set of wheels and tires for track use. 

My car has 18" wheels which severely limits my choices of tires. I would
like to have a tire that works better on the track, and also works on the
street (and rain). The S02 distorts a lot on the track: 15 degree wear on
center tread blocks, and they require a lot of negative camber for flat
wear. This "flexy" behavior is what makes them an excellent street tire. I
can't get enough neg. camber on my car for this tire to work properly. So I
am looking to either get another street tire that works better on the
track, or get another set of wheels with BFG R1's. Michelin MXX3 has been
suggested as a better (than S02) tire for the dry track, but are not as
good in the rain, and ride harder than the S02. So I would list the MXX3,
S02, and P-Zero as my prioritized list of tires. I'm leaning toward
continuing with street tires because I don't really  care if I get maximum
track performance (there is always someone faster than you on the track),
and because I drive my car daily.  I definitely do not want to drive racing
tires on the street every day for all the reasons that have already been
discussed.

I'm resisting getting another set of wheels with R1's because I do not want
to change wheels continually. Also 8" and 10" wide high quality wheels are
pretty expensive. But the 17" R1 (18" not made yet) is much cheaper than
18" tires of any kind. As you can see I have not resolved my own dilemma.
But I hope that this discussion helps you with yours.
