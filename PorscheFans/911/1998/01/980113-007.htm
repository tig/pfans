These were the suggestions I received from various sources for winter
hibernation :

1. fill the gas tank to the top to prevent moisture buildup and add
gasoline stabilizer.  Run the engine to have the stabilizer spread
throughout the fuel system
2. cover the exhaust and intake openings to keep out insects and other
things
3. change the oil and filter before going into storage
4. emergency brake off
5. transmission in gear
6. add 10 psi per tire, to help prevent flat spotting.  Don't put the
car on jack stands.
7. put can of moisture absorb in the interior
8. fresh air inlet open
9. clean the body, then cover the car
10. don't run the car during the winter unless you can get it to
operating temperature.  The
thinking was that just a short idle sends out moisture into the exhaust
system, doesn't burn off contaminants in the oil, and does more harm to
the engine than good.
11. remove battery and store it in a warm place.  My question to the
list yesterday concerned what to do with charge.  So far the only
respondent said he puts a charge on the battery monthly.

Hope this helps.

Bill
