John and Mike,
An irratic idle can be caused by the air bypass valve Mike mentions.
This looks like a small alum. can approx. 2inch diameter and 4 inchs
long.  It has a wired connector on one end and two hoses connected to
the other end.  It is situated at the top of the engine just behind
throttle valve (towards you) and is pretty easy to find.  I had this
problem with my 3.6L and was told to pull it out and spray the inside
with WD40 or comparable lube to unstick the valve.   If the valve is
sticky from years of cycling over a short distance, especially when
cold, this could solve your problem.  If the valve is broken, well...at
least it's easy to replace.  Hope this helps.

Robert:

An extra shock would be news to me.  Don't you already have 2?  Turbos, at
least the early ones, with the very heavy turbo spoiler had 2 (which at times
struggle to support the lid).  Performance Products, and probably others, sell
a kit to add a third but I'd try things the normal way first.  Remember, the
shocks do wear out and get weak.
