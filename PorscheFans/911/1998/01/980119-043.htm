P-Fans,

After a first weekend's drive with new 78 SC, I have some questions
about idle settings.  I'm sure this has been covered recently, but since
it didn't apply to me (then), I wasn't paying attention.

For reference, the trip was Long Beach - San Diego; 120 miles each way.
Drove straight through; weather was 60-70 and clear.

Cold idle is 1300-1400.  Runs smoothly at all times cold.  Once fully
warmed up it *usually* idles at 1000.  On two occasions, after running
for two hours at highway speeds, idle was 1800 and wouldn't drop off
even after repeated "blipping".  Slight ease on clutch at idle would
make it drop to the normal 1000. 

On two occasions, both after full warm-ups and vigorous drives, the
engine started kind of hard...maybe ten seconds of starter, then it
would slowly "chug" to life...after three of four seconds, would idle
normally and run perfectly.

I get the feeling the high idle condition and hard starting (both when
fully warm, but not hot) are related - too rich?

Car is 78 SC, bone stock, no engine modification, 135,000 miles.  Fresh
oil and filters, plug condition unknown at this time.

Any suggestions are appreciated.

Hi,

>> The Jan/Feb issue of Grassroots Motorsports magazine has a quote from BFG's
race tire engineer Jim Fogerty. "Being able to drive to and from an event
is part of the idea behind DOT approved race tires. ...if used gently you
see 10,000 - 20,000 street miles." <<

This is not the same as DRIVING them on the street all the time.
The idea is to allow guys to put them on Friday or Saturday and drive
to the event to save valuable time. If driven on the street daily
you can have sidewall cracks or other failures.

Though I have ONLY TA R1s for my car I still do not recommend
using them as your only street tires. Besides they are no fun
at all as you can't slide them or drift unless you are crazy
enough to take on/off ramps at over 100MPH. Street tires
are a lot more fun on a balanced car.

I asked Jim Fogarty this question today and he agreed (I quote) :

" You are correct.  My comments were in regard to saving time at an event. 
We don't think people should use R1's as an everyday street tire.  But of
course, many people do.  But the concerns you mentioned are real.  And
anyone who runs R1's as their everyday street tire, will have to live with
those concerns.

But we don't think driving even a couple hundred miles to and from an event
on R1's, (in decent weather of course), is a problem.  But when you get
back home, change back to regular street tires for the daily drive to and
from work. "

So run them if you must but realize the consequences.
