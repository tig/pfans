I am replacing the seats in my 71 911 with some from a 79 911 using the 
adapter rails.

How do you put the seat belts back in?  They connected to the seats in the 71 
but the 79 seats don't have anywhere to mount them.
What do most people do about the seatbelts when they upgrade their seats?

Hi P-Fans ( and John Bull, who posted the original message):

John, you write about an unstable idle on your 84 Carrera. For these 84-89 DME
Carreras, there is an "idle positioner" , which looks like a small canister.
It is located in the middle of the engine compartment, behind the fan shroud,
and in front of the intake assembly. A small rubber hose runs vertically (from
the air intake elbow) to the top of the postioner , and another small hose is
attached on the bottom of the positioner( this will make more sense after you
peek into the engine compartment. It is also shown on p.272 of the Haynes
manual).  Remove the postioner ( just some hose clamps involved) from the 2
small hoses ( at least the top one), and squirt some carb cleaner through it.
Reassemble.  That alone might do it. Run some Techron in your fuel once in a
while to keep things clean. Failing this, you might want to check for intake
system leaks. Torque down the intake manifold where it connects to the engine,
if you suspect a leak, and check all hoses for tightness and air leaks.  As a
further point of interest, I was told by a local mechanic that  you can chase
down intake leaks by using a small bottle propane torch ( NOT lit !, just a
small propane gas flow ) near suspected air leaks. If the engine speeds up ,
you found it. Have an extinguisher nearby.  Any confirmation by others on the
list that this will work ( or too dangerous, etc?).
