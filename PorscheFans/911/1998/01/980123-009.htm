Just find a good news/book store and ask for it. If they're any good,
they'll have it already or order a copy for you. I'll wager that you'll have
a subscription soon...  ;-)

I wrote in about 2 weeks ago asking if anyone knew where I might be able to
purchase Venetian Blue touch-up paint (87 and 88 Carreras) since it was
discontinued.  I received a number of E-Mails asking that if I found out to
let them know because they were having the same problem.  I live in San
Francisco, so I am not sure this will help everyone.  I went to Carlsen
Porsche (dealer) body shop in Palo Alto and they will make up a bottle of
touch-up paint in any Porsche color for $6.00.  I would guess the bottle is 1
or 2 ozs which is plently.  Since this is the cheapest thing I ever bought for
a Porsche I felt like saying give me a dozen.  If Carlsen does this I would
assume other shops would do it also.
