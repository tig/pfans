I own an '87 911 Targa with 40k miles that I bought last spring. I can't
answer all your questions, but here's my 2 cents, following each of your
questions:

 > - The car has 87k miles. what would be the expected lifetime of
    a 3.2L motronic? I like the car a lot, but don't want to do a 
    rebuild in the near future. Any idea what the range of miles
    for rebuilds on these things (ie as early as, or at late as).
    I am willing to rebuild later, but don't want to for a few
    years (it will be a daily driver).
**********************************
The engine has a lot of life left in it. Bruce Anderson, a leading expert
on the 911, has said that he's seen 200,000 miles on some 3.2 engines. The
leading replacement issue, IMHO, is likely to be the clutch. If your
pre-purchase inspection compression/leakdown test shows no problems, then
you've probabaly got several tens of thousand of miles of fun before doing
the next thing that happens, valve guides. The engine control systems have
generally been relatively bulletproof.

 > - The price tag is just under $25k. Does that sound reasonable?
    I'm probably paying a premium buying it at a dealer, but I'm
    more comfortable buying from a reputable dealer than privately.
    I also think I can get financed easier when arranged through 
    a dealer.
***************************
Sounds a bit steep for a car with 87k miles, but you don't note whether
that's the asking price, or the final deal you've bargained into. If the
former, bargain, bargain, bargain...... A good price for an '87 in very
good condition with 87k miles should be around $21-22k, again IMHO. Mine,
with 40k miles and overall excellent shape, was $27k, and I figured the
condition/mileage premium was about $3k.

 > - I'm wondering how I can verify that everything is stock and
    the fenders are original. Should I get it checked out by 
    another mechanic even though it's being bought by a porsche
    specialist? 
************************
Absolutely! Find a reputable independent shop and pay them the $150-200 it
will cost for a thorough pre-purchase inspection. Make sure it includes a
compression and leakdown test, and get under the car while it's on the lift
and look around yourself, too. Try to have the inspector drive the car a
few miles, also. Your comment about "...it's being bought by a Porsche
specialist...." mystified me. Are you referring to the dealer or yourself?

 > - Anything special I need to know about this year/model 911?
    Were there problems with chain guards in 1987?
*************************
The chain tensioners are the newer design hydraulic type which were
supposed to cure the earlier problems. I haven't heard of much, if any,
trouble with them. See if you can find a local Porsche Club of America
contact (start with "www.pca.org") and get a look at a series of books
called "Upfixin' der Porsche". The later volumes will have plenty of
stories about technical problems with 3.2 litre cars.

 > - I'm new to the USA and not very familiar with the DOT or 
    DMV rules and regs. Is it possible to get info on the car
    from these sources via VIN? I'm in california. Any way 
    to find out accident records and such?
**************************
Sorry, I can't help you in this department.

 > - How hard is it to check the numbers on this car? Are the 
    engine and chassis numbers easily accessible? Any idea where
    I can find them?
***************************
The chassis number is the VIN. The engine number is located (I think) on
the case just to the right side of the fan housing. I know that it is
possible to find out if the engine and chassis numbers "match", but I don't
personally know how to do it. Are you out there, Bruce Anderson?

>  - Any recommendation on dealers or mechanics in the northen
    california area? (peferably SF/San Jose area)?
*****************************
I'm in upstate New York, so I don't know, but if you contact someone from
PCA who's in that area, (Golden Gate Region covers the area around San
Francisco) they can help. Also, you might give a call to Automotion.
They're located in the San Jose area and may be able to help.

Good luck with your car. Targas are a really fun way to combine great
performance with drop-top fun.
