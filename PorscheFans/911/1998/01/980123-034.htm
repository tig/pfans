Steve:  I have worked with Chris and Ted at Chris's German Auto in =
Bellevue (425-462-9296)  for the past several years.  Even though I =
enjoy doing most of the work on my 911, I let these guys do the "heavy =
lifting" that is beyond my abilities.  They have always done very high =
quality work at reasonable prices.  On several occasions, I've pulled in =
for quick fixes or advice, and received same free of charge.  Chris is =
also active in the local Porsche club, has a sweet 911S,  and is a good =
guy to get to know.

Hope this helps.
